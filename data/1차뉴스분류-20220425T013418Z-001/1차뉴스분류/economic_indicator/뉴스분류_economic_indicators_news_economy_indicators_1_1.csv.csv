Of that, private overseas investors bought $91.9 billion in Treasuries and foreign official institutions sold $16.2 billion.
Foreigners have bought Treasuries in 10 of the last 12 months, including a record net monthly purchase of $118 billion in March 2021.
Overall, Treasury International Capital (TIC) data showed a net inflow of $162.6 billion, versus a $287.4 billion inflow in January. Of this, net foreign private inflows were $198.4 billion, and net foreign official flows were negative $35.8 billion.
The overall foreign buying came as U.S. yields rose. U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields peaked at 2.0650% in February, reaching the highest level since July 2019, and ended the month at 1.8216%, up about 4 basis points from the end of January.
The yield on the two-year note rose to 1.4363% in February from 1.1846% at the end of January, reaching a peak of 1.6430% that was last seen in December 2019, as markets anticipated that the Federal Reserve would imminently start hiking interest rates to slow price rises and stave off hotter inflation. 
The Fed did raise its policy rate in March by 0.25 basis points, the first hike since 2018, and announced how it would reduce its $8.5 trillion balance sheet, ballooned by pandemic-era bond purchases. Several more rate hikes are expected this year and next.
Foreign holdings of Treasury securities rose to $7.714 trillion from $7.661 trillion in January. 

Japan's holdings of Treasury securities rose by more than $3 billion to $1.306 trillion. Japan remained the largest non-U.S. holder of Treasuries.
China, the second-largest holder of Treasuries, saw its holdings decline to $1.054 trillion from $1.060 trillion in January.

1,"<span>Apr 15, 2022 04:30PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - A sharp rebound in automotive output in March spurred a third straight monthly gain in U.S. factory activity, perhaps signaling the worst of the production woes that have dogged the motor vehicle industry over the last year may have passed. 
Overall industrial production increased 0.9% last month, keeping pace with February's upwardly revised pace, the Federal Reserve said on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory production accelerating 0.4%. Output jumped 5.5% from a year earlier.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the American economy, has benefited from a shift in spending to goods from services during the COVID-19 pandemic. But manufacturers have struggled to cope with the strong demand while labor markets have become extraordinarily tight and supply bottlenecks have persisted due to COVID lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine.
Especially hard hit by supply issues has been the automotive sector, where production has been hampered for more than a year by a global shortage of electronic components, especially the computer chips needed for today's increasingly complex vehicle operating systems. 
Graphic: U.S. auto production rebounded in March - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/akpezjdyjvr/chart.png 
But U.S. motor vehicle and parts production shot up by 7.8% last month, the largest increase since October, after a downwardly revised drop of 4.6% in February. Total assemblies of cars and light trucks rose to nearly 9.5 million vehicles at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, the highest since January 2021, up from 8.3 million the month before.
""The auto industry is making a comeback,"" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica (NYSE:CMA) Bank, said in a note. ""Production plunged in 2021 as the chip shortage idled factories. Now that is reversing as carmakers work through the challenge and find ways to stretch their chip supplies.""
The production recovery should further fuel a pickup in auto sales that have been held back by the supply shortages, Adams said. Even as consumer spending shifts back toward services in the months ahead as COVID caseloads ease, ""vehicle sales have brighter prospects this year than other categories of durable consumer goods.""
""Since sales last year were held back so much by the chip shortage, vehicle sales are constrained much more by supply than demand, and so will grow solidly in 2022 and 2023 despite higher (interest) rates on car loans and less support from fiscal stimulus,"" he said.
Overall industrial sector capacity utilization, a measure of how fully companies are using their resources, rose to 78.3% last month, the highest in more than three years, from 77.7% the month before. It is 1.2 percentage points below its 1972-2021 average.
Capacity use for the manufacturing sector increased to 78.7% in March, the highest level since 2007, from 78.1% in February. 
Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.
A separate report from the New York Federal Reserve on Friday showed manufacturing activity in New York state has accelerated in April, even as inflationary pressures kept building.

Its Empire State Manufacturing Index rose to a four-month high of 24.6 after a reading of negative 11.8 in March. The survey's prices paid index shot to a record high of 86.4 from 73.8 last month.
Optimism in the outlook waned, however, with the six-month outlook index dropping to 15.2, the lowest in about two years, from 36.6 in March.

Average new home prices in 70 major cities were unchanged on a month-on-month basis for the second time in a row, according to Reuters calculations based on March data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
On a year-on-year basis, new home prices rose 1.5%, the slowest pace since November 2015, and easing from a 2.0% gain in February.
Over 60 cities have eased curbs on home purchases to support the ailing property market, after a government campaign to reduce developers' high debt levels pushed the sector into a deep chill in the second half of 2021.
Banks in over 100 Chinese cities have lowered mortgage rates by around 20 to 60 basis points since March，central bank official Zou Lan said on Thursday.
But after signs of improvement in January, a surge in cases of the highly transmissible Omicron variant and strict virus lockdown measures have again cooled demand in many cities.
In tier-one cities, prices gained 0.4% on month, narrowing from a 0.5% rise in February, while growth in tier-two cities was zero.
""The growth slowdown in first-tier cities in March was mainly due to the impact of the COVID pandemic, indicating weaker market expectations,"" said analyst Xu Xiaole at Beike Research Institute.
More cities are likely to relax property curbs in the near future, and demand will be gradually released, said Xu.
The property market in the commercial hub of Shanghai slowed with home prices rising at the slowest pace in four months, at 0.3% month-on-month.
Shanghai is in the midst of China's worst outbreak since the virus emerged in Wuhan in late 2019, reporting more than 20,000 cases daily amid an unprecedented citywide lockdown. Dozens more cities are in partial or full lockdown.
Price growth in Shanghai does not reflect the overall market situation, said analyst Lu Wenxi at property agency Centaline.
""The growth in new home prices in Shanghai will further ease in April,"" Lu added.
In March, transactions by value of newly built homes in Shanghai slumped 27% from a month earlier to 36.2 billion yuan ($5.68 billion)，financial magazine Yicai said.
China's State Council, or cabinet, on Wednesday said more policy measures are needed to support the economy, but analysts are unsure if interest rate cuts would quickly reverse the slump as long as the government maintains its zero tolerance COVID-19 policy.

In the first 12 days of April, new home sales by volume in 30 cities surveyed by Wind were down 55.6% year-on-year, analysts at Nomura said in a client note on Wednesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased solidly in March, boosted by record- high gasoline prices, but consumers are starting to feel the pinch of high inflation, with online spending posting back-to-back declines for the first time in more than a year.
The report from the Commerce Department on Thursday, which also showed stronger retail sales growth in February than initially thought, suggested consumer spending picked up in the first quarter, helping to underpin the overall economy. 
A tightening labor market, which is driving up wages, and massive savings accumulated during the pandemic are providing some cushion against inflation. Annual inflation surged by the most in more than 40 years in March, though there are signs price pressures have peaked and should start to gradually abate.
""The report still reveals the resilience of consumer spending,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""There is no doubt households are feeling the pinch from skyrocketing prices across an array of products. But there are signs that pandemic-related inflation is beginning to ease."" 
Retail sales rose 0.5% last month. Data for February was revised higher to show sales increasing 0.8% instead of 0.3% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales climbing 0.6%, with estimates ranging from as low as a 0.3% decline to as high as 2.2% jump. 
Retail sales, which are mostly goods, advanced 6.9% on a year-on-year basis. They are not adjusted for inflation. 
GRAPHIC: Retail sales https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xmvjoqzlkpr/retailsales.png 
Sales at service stations shot up 8.9%, accounting for the bulk of the increase in sales in March. Monthly consumer prices increased by the most in 16-1/2 years in March as Russia's war against Ukraine boosted the cost of U.S. gasoline to record highs. Prices at the pump on average soared to an all-time high of $4.33 per gallon in March, according to AAA.
Excluding gasoline, retail sales fell 0.3%. 
Though gasoline prices have since retreated to an average of $4.074 per gallon, high inflation is likely to prevail. A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed import prices jumped 2.6% last month, the largest rise since April 2011, after increasing 1.6% in February.
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
GRAPHIC: Inflation https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/dwpkrqoagvm/inflation.png 
STRONG LABOR MARKET 
Soaring prices are reducing consumers' purchasing power, but rising wages are helping to blunt some of the hit. The unemployment rate is at a two-year low of 3.6% and there were a near-record 11.3 million job openings at the end of February, making it easier for some cash-strapped Americans to take a second job or pick up extra shifts.
Consumers also accumulated more than $2 trillion in excess savings during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 18,000 to a still-low seasonally adjusted 185,000 for the week ended April 9. Economists had forecast 171,000 applications for the latest week. 
Declining gasoline prices and the firming labor market led to consumer sentiment rebounding from a decade low in early April. 
GRAPHIC: Consumer sentiment https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/egvbkbzyrpq/UMich.png 
Better job security is also allowing some consumers to take on more debt. Last month, clothing store sales rose 2.6%. There were also increases in receipts at building material, garden equipment and supplies stores as well as at furniture, food and electronics and appliance retailers. 
Sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores rose 3.3%. Receipts at bars and restaurants, the only services category in the retail sales report, rose 1.0%. Demand for services like air travel and hotel accommodation is surging, providing further support for consumer spending. This follows the rolling back of pandemic restrictions. 
But sales at auto dealerships fell 1.9% amid ongoing motor vehicle shortages. Online store sales tumbled 6.4% after falling 3.5% in February, the first back-to-back decline since the last two months of 2020, which some economists attributed to strained household budgets because of the gasoline price shock. Others blamed shifting seasonal patterns.
Online retail sales have declined from a peak of $100.0 billion in January to $90.350 billion in March. There are worries that rising interest rates as the Federal Reserve tries to stamp out inflation could cool demand in the months ahead.
""If previous environments are any indication, the latter half of 2022 could see a slowdown in consumer demand as the Fed tries to contain elevated price levels,"" said Peter Essele, head of portfolio management at Commonwealth Financial Network.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales dipped 0.1% in March. Data for February was revised higher to show these so-called core retail sales declining 0.9% instead of 1.2% as previously reported.

Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. February's upward revision and March's modest fall prompted some economists to lift their first-quarter consumer spending and GDP growth estimates. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) hiked its GDP growth estimate to a 1.5% rate from a 1.0% pace. The economy grew at a robust 6.9% rate in the fourth quarter.
""Today's report continues to reflect strong consumer demand in the first quarter, but we see headwinds from the oil price shock combined with tighter monetary policy lowering real consumer spending growth later this year and next,"" said Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York.

(Reuters) - Through most of the pandemic, Kent International, Inc couldn’t import enough Chinese-made bicycles to supply Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and its other big U.S. retail customers.
But in recent months, the New Jersey-based wholesaler and manufacturer built a nice buffer -- about a 10-week supply at its three warehouses in California, South Carolina and New Jersey, compared to the pre-COVID normal of four to six weeks of stock. And the company is glad to have it, now that a new wave of shutdowns in China to combat rising COVID cases is roiling global supply chains.
""The supply chain for bicycles has caught up,"" said Arnold Kamler, the CEO.
Many U.S. companies are in the same position. Inventory levels have gone up in recent months as U.S. port congestion eased and supply chains have begun to untangle.
Wholesale inventories surged 19.9% in February on a year-on-year basis, according to figures released by the Commerce Department on Thursday. They were up 2.5% from January.
Most economists predict inventories could continue the upswing, since inflation-adjusted inventories remain below their pre-pandemic level. Inventory-to-sales ratios are also low.
The challenge now is the latest shutdown in China, which is clogging highways and ports and stranding workers inside factories or shutting down production. These disruptions are sending a new ripple through global supply chains for goods ranging from electric cars to iPhones.
Don DiCostanzo, chief executive of Pedego Electric Bikes, said he started adding to inventories a year ago and opened a second warehouse in February near his office in California to hold the overflow.
""We've stocked it to the gills,"" he said. ""But we have challenges with incoming inventory because Shanghai has been shut down for a month."" That might mean shortages as the company moves into its busy summer season. It also means Pedego will have to delay the launch of a new product planned for June, because those bikes won’t make it on time.
'A MORE NORMAL CYCLE'
Some companies have built up inventories with an eye on grabbing market share from competitors who didn’t move as fast to refill shelves.
Automatic Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) Covers, Inc in Indiana, for instance, is now sitting on three times as much inventory as it held just before the pandemic. 
Michael Shebek, the company's CEO, said he was able to do that by sharply expanding the number of suppliers he used to get materials and parts. He said the demand for new pools appears to be easing, though it remains elevated. During the pandemic, businesses that sold items needed to make life more comfortable for those homebound by quarantines surged.
For now, Shebek said having extra inventory has given him ""a competitive advantage over those who don’t have it.""
Kamler, the CEO of Kent, said last year he was ""scrambling for bicycles like they were gold - but now, we’re in a more normal cycle.""
The Chinese factory that supplies most of his bicycles in Kunshan, near Shanghai, has now shut down. Whether that eventually causes another round of shortages for him depends on how long the halt lasts, he said, noting that with the fatter inventories he now holds, it shouldn’t be a problem unless it goes on longer than a month.
To be sure, there’s a dark side to holding all those goods. ""The cash issue is the one nobody talks about,"" said Kamler.
He estimates that he’s now paying U.S. Customs $4 million to $5 million a month in duties on his imported bikes. He also has a factory in South Carolina that makes bikes, but it relies heavily on Chinese parts that also carry tariffs. When he ships goods to retailers, he recovers this cost. But carrying inventories for longer periods means carrying that added cost longer.

The higher cost of ocean freight -- which shot up during the pandemic and remains elevated -- also remains a burden.
Before the pandemic, Kamler said he paid $2,000 to ship a container from China to one of his U.S. warehouses. His shipper just notified him that on May 1, that rate will go from $5,000 a container to $9,000.

5,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 11:05AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment rebounded unexpectedly in early April from a decade low with the strong job market lifting the outlook for wage growth and a fall in gasoline prices from the previous month's record high helping to cap expectations for a further acceleration in inflation, a survey showed on Thursday.
The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index rose to 65.7 on a preliminary basis this month from a final reading of 59.4 in March, which had been the lowest since 2011. That topped expectations for a reading of 59, according to a Reuters poll of economists, and helped snap a skid of three consecutive monthly declines.
The increase came almost entirely from a jump in the expectations index to 64.1 on a preliminary basis from a March final level of 54.3. Assessments of current conditions were little changed.
Consumers' estimates for the rate of inflation over the next year were unchanged at 5.4%, which is the highest since 1981 and signals that consumers have some faith that measured inflation will recede from a four-decade high of 8.5% hit in March. And, for a third straight month, they estimated inflation over the next five years at 3.0%.
The U.S. Federal Reserve last month lifted interest rates for the first time since 2018 and officials there have signaled an aggressive campaign of rate hikes in the months ahead to rein in inflation. 
The improvement in expectations was powered by a 29.4% jump in the economic outlook for the year ahead and a 17.2% increase in personal financial expectations, survey Director Richard Curtin said in a statement. 
""A strong labor market bolstered wage expectations among consumers under age 45 to 5.3% - the largest expected gain in more than three decades, since April 1990,"" Curtin said.

He also said consumers estimated a negligible change in gas prices in the year ahead after the previous month's prediction that they would rise by nearly 50 cents a gallon a year out.
Gas prices have dropped by more than 25 cents a gallon after hitting a record $4.33 in early March, according to AAA.

Inventories jumped 12.4% on a year-on-year basis in February. Retail inventories increased 1.2% in February, instead of 1.1% as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 2.0% rise in January.
Motor vehicle inventories rose 0.9% as estimated last month. They increased 2.7% in January. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, climbed 1.4%, rather than 1.2% as estimated last month.
Inventory investment surged at a robust seasonally adjusted annualized rate of $193.2 billion in the fourth quarter, contributing 5.32 percentage points to the quarter's 6.9% growth pace. Most economists see further scope for inventories to rise, noting that inflation-adjusted inventories remain below their pre-pandemic level. Sales-to-inventory ratios are also low.
Businesses are restocking after drawing down inventories from the first quarter of 2021 through the third quarter. Growth estimates for the first quarter are around a 1.0% rate.

Wholesale inventories increased 2.5% in February. Stocks at manufacturers gained 0.6%.

Investing.com -- U.S. retail sales growth slowed in March, as record-high gasoline prices and rising prices for food and shelter forced consumers to cut back on other spending. 
Retail sales grew only 0.5%, from an upwardly revised 0.8% gain in February. That was marginally below analysts' forecasts for a 0.6% increase. Core sales, which exclude automobile purchases, held up somewhat better, at 1.1%. As a result, retail sales were up 6.9% on the year. 
The government's data aren't adjusted for inflation. Consumer prices have risen 8.5% in the last 12 months, so the retail sales number reflects a drop in spending in real terms, consistent with other figures that show many U.S. consumers have now run down the excess savings that they accumulated during the pandemic.
Widespread lockdowns and generous subsidies to households this time last year had created a boom in retail sales that has been slowly subsiding since the economy began to reopen and government stimulus checks came to an end. 
However, the U.S. economy still appears to be in broadly good shape, according to comments from the CEOs of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) over the last 36 hours. 
That continues to be reflected in data from the labor market, where initial jobless claims ticked up only marginally to 185,000 from last week's 60-year low of 167,000.
New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said to Bloomberg on Thursday that the Fed needs to ""remove the froth"" from the labor market by using monetary policy to bring the level of vacancies - currently near all-time highs at over 11 million - down to a level ""commensurate with maximum employment"".

""We sell it at the same price as before. Also with the impact of the pandemic, everybody is hanging in there. It is the same all over Beijing, we are not the only restaurant suffering,"" Ma said.
Asian restaurants and street food hawkers like Ma's face the tough choice of taking the hit from higher costs or passing them on and risk losing loyal customers.
Spiralling prices for ingredients and material that started with supply chain snags during the COVID-19 pandemic and are now being propped up by the war in Ukraine are squeezing businesses and consumers.
Households in Asia, where tasty and affordable street food is an integral part of society and the economy, are feeling the pressure the most. 
Mohammad Ilyas, a cook at a biryani store in Karachi, Pakistan, said the price of a kilogram of the seasoned rice dish, enough to feed three to four people, has doubled to 400 Pakistani rupees ($2.20). 
""I have been working at this kitchen for the last 15 years,"" he said. ""These days prices of rice and spices have gone up so much that poor people can't afford to eat it.""
Some businesses are dealing with the cost pressures by cutting portion sizes. 
At one of Jakarta’s street food corners, nasi goreng vendor Syahrul Zainullah has reduced his servings of the signature Indonesian fried rice dish rather than raise prices or use lower grade ingredients.
In South Korea, where consumer inflation is at a decade-high, Choi Sun-hwa, a 67-year-old kimchi shop owner, only gets seven heads of cabbage for the price she used to pay for 10.
The spicy fermented cabbage is traditionally served as a free side dish with other meals at Korean eateries, but even that has become an extravagance.
Seo Jae-eun, a customer at Choi's store, quips kimchi should now be called ""keum-chi"", keum being Korean for gold.
""I can't ask restaurants to give more kimchi these days and it's too expensive to make my own at home due to high-priced vegetables...so I came here to buy it,"" she said.
Choi says she won't be able to continue if she can't raise prices.

10,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 11:05PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - U.S. consumer credit and debit card spending so far in 2022 is up 15% on a year earlier, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) research showed on Wednesday, a sign that Americans' gloom about the economy owing to high inflation has yet to translate into lower demand.
In fact, lower-income households - often described as the most vulnerable to an inflation-induced shock - are spending the most relative to their prepandemic outlays, the bank's researchers found.
To be sure, Bank of America Institute researchers said some of that group's spending will reflect high inflation, with March's consumer price index registering an 8.5% year-over-year increase, the highest in over 40 years. Also, such households typically spend a higher share of their budgets on food, gas and utilities, which contributed most heavily to the CPI increase.
""But the level of card spending in this group is still way above pre-pandemic levels: the very latest Bank of America debit and credit card spending per household data shows card spending up 33.3% among the below $50K group in three years to the week of 9th April,"" they wrote.
Card spending this year through April 8 was 15% higher than in the same period last year.
Surveys such as the University of Michigan's widely followed Consumer Sentiment Index have painted a picture of U.S. consumers who are the most distressed about the economy in more than a decade, often a signal that they may rein in spending.
""But people don't always actually do what they say they are doing – sentiment is not the same as action,"" the bank wrote.
""The actual hard data does not support the gloom.""
Data from the Census Bureau due out on Thursday in fact is expected to show U.S. retail sales rose 0.6% in March from the month before, a Reuters poll of economists shows, which would mark an acceleration from February's increase of 0.3%.
Monthly growth in retail sales averaged 1.4% over the 12 months through February, more than three times the rate that prevailed in the year before the pandemic.
Bank of America researchers attributed the ongoing strength in large part to the U.S. job market. The unemployment rate is 3.6% - roughly where it was before the pandemic - there are nearly two open jobs for every unemployed person and hourly wages are rising at their fastest in years, at an annual rate of 5.6%. 
""(B)eneath this already rosy picture, the story is even better at the lower end of the wage distribution,"" they said. Wages in the lowest-paying industries such as leisure and hospitality are up 11.8% year over year.
Another factor continuing to prop up spending, especially among low-income households, is the cash remaining at their disposal. Bank accounts are still well stocked from higher wages and residual funds from repeated rounds of federal stimulus during the pandemic.

Households with incomes below $50,000 a year have at least $1,500 more in the bank than they did at the start of 2019, a figure that represents 5% of that income group's household spending that year.
""It is hard to reconcile high bank balances and high card spending with the idea that lower income households are being overwhelmed by higher prices,"" the researchers wrote.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's unemployment rate held at a 13-year low in March as jobs growth slowed after months of strong gains, though record-high vacancies suggest it is only a matter of time before unemployment falls further.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Thursday showed a jobless rate of 4.0%, when analysts had looked for a drop to 3.9% and the lowest reading since 1974.
That will be a disappointment to Prime Minister Scott Morrison who was hoping a sub-4 number would bolster his economic credentials amid a close election campaign.
It might also ease pressure on the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to lift interest rates next month, though markets are still wagering the first hike in a decade will come in June.
There is no doubt the labour market remains very tight with employment rising by another 17,900 in March, and a stellar 338,000 in the past 12 months.
Underemployment hit the lowest since 2008 and participation rates held near record highs at 66.4%. Demand for labour is also red hot with vacancies at an all-time peak of 423,500, 86% higher than their pre-pandemic levels.
The RBA has already dropped a pledge to be patient on policy amid signs the tightening labour market was finally pushing wages higher, and adding to inflationary pressure.
More businesses are planning to pass on rising input and labour costs to customers, a major change from recent years when fierce competition kept prices restrained.
The consumer price index - due out on April 27 - is expected to surge well above 4%, while core inflation should top the RBA's 2-3% target band for the first time in a decade.
All of which has led financial markets to fully price in a rate hike to 0.25% in June, and some risk the RBA could go all the way to 0.50% in one go.
Central banks in New Zealand and Canada both hiked by half a point this week and the U.S. Federal Reserve is considered almost certain to do the same in May.
""The increasing ability of firms to pass on higher costs is something the RBA has been looking out for,"" said Nomura economist Andrew Ticehurst.

""So the task of withdrawing accommodation appears more urgent than ever,"" he added. ""The risk appears to be for more rate hikes, rather than less."" 
He is tipping rises in June, July, August, November and December.

12,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 10:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s economy added fewer jobs than forecast in March, while unemployment held at a 13-1/2 year low, as the labor market’s powerful recovery in recent months hit an air pocket.
Employment rose by 17,900 from a month earlier, led by full-time roles, while coming in below economists’ expectation of a 30,000 gain, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed on Thursday. Unemployment held at 4%, versus a forecast fall to 3.9%, while labor market participation remained steady.
“We have continued to see strong increases in youth employment over the past year,” said Bjorn Jarvis, head of labor statistics at the ABS. “The youth employment-to-population ratio in March was the highest it had been since August 2008.”
The Australian dollar fell and was trading at 74.53 U.S. cents at 11:39 a.m. in Sydney. Three-year government bond yields edged down.
The result may disappoint Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who has sought to burnish his government’s economic credentials as he bids for a come-from-behind win at Australia’s May 21 ballot. Yet beyond the monthly results, the labor market has been on a steady path to improvement and the economy is growing strongly.

Prices on nearly everything from vegetables and sugar to clothes and smartphones have risen sharply in recent weeks after Russia on Feb. 24 began what it calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine.
The central bank warned on Wednesday that consumer inflation in Russia will keep on accelerating in annual terms due to base effects, saying that rouble volatility will lead to upside inflationary pressure.
Weekly inflation in Russia slowed to 0.66% in the week to April 8 from 0.99% a week earlier, taking the year-to-date increase in consumer prices to 10.83%, data from statistics service Rosstat showed on Wednesday.
In the same period a year ago, consumer prices rose 2.72%.
In March, consumer prices in Russia jumped 7.61%, their biggest month-on-month increase since January 1999, as the economy took a hit from sanctions and a record fall in the rouble, which has pared its losses since then.

The central bank, which aims for annual inflation of 4%, cut its key rate to 17% from 20% on Friday and said future cuts were possible.
Inflation in Russia could reach between 17% and 20% this year, Alexei Kudrin, the head of Russia's audit chamber, said on Wednesday. Analysts polled by Reuters in late March had on average forecast 2022 inflation to accelerate to 23.7%, its highest since 1999.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. monthly producer prices increased by the most in more than 12 years in March amid strong demand for goods and services, the latest sign of persistently high inflation that could compel the Federal Reserve to aggressively tighten monetary policy. 
The report from the Labor Department on Wednesday also showed strong underlying inflation pressures at the factory gate, raising doubts that a decline in the cost of goods, excluding food and energy, in March reported in Tuesday's consumer prices data would be sustainable. Economists expect the U.S. central bank will hike rates by 50 basis points next month, and soon start trimming its asset portfolio. 
""The broad-based increases reinforce yesterday's CPI report that will keep the Fed on its aggressive tightening path in the coming months,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""Supply chain easing, especially on the goods side of production, will be an important source of disinflation for the Fed to successfully achieve its goal of price stability.""
The producer price index for final demand increased 1.4%, the largest gain since the government revamped the series in December 2009, after rising 0.9% in February. 
Goods prices increased 2.3%, matching February's advance. A 5.7% rise in energy prices accounted for more than half of the increase in the PPI last month. There were increases in gasoline and electricity, but natural gas prices fell. Energy prices jumped 7.5% in February.
Food prices climbed 2.4%, though the cost of beef and veal fell 7.3%. Wholesale prices of iron and steel scrap also rose, but the cost of cold rolled steel sheet and strip declined.
Inflation was initially fanned by a massive cash infusion from the government to cushion against the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which unleashed strong demand for goods and strained supply chains. Supply bottlenecks had started to ease, but progress was stalled by the Russia-Ukraine war. Renewed lockdowns in China to contain rising COVID-19 cases are also seen disrupting supply chains.
Services inflation is also building up amid the rolling back of pandemic restrictions on businesses. Wholesale services prices jumped 0.9% in March after climbing 0.3% in February. A 1.2% rise in margins for final demand trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, accounted for more than 40% of the rise in services.
Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.
PEAK OR PLATEAU?
The Fed in March raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years. Minutes of the policy meeting published last Wednesday appeared to set the stage for big rate increases down the road. 
The cost of transportation and warehousing services also increased strongly last month. There were also gains in prices of hotel and motel accommodation, airline fares, inpatient care as well as hardware, building materials and supplies retailing.
But the cost of securities brokerage, dealing and investment advice fell 5.4%. Portfolio management fees also decreased. 
In the 12 months through March, the PPI jumped 11.2%, the largest year-on-year increase since the current series was introduced in November 2010, after advancing 10.3% in February.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI rising 1.1% and accelerating 10.6% year-on-year. Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices accelerated 0.9% in March. The so-called core PPI increased 0.2% in February. In the 12 months through March, the core PPI soared 7.0% after rising 6.7% in February. 
The government reported on Tuesday that monthly consumer prices increased by the most in 16-1/2 years in March. But core goods prices dropped by the most in two years, restraining monthly underlying consumer inflation in March. That offered cautious hope that inflation, which by all measures has far exceeded the Fed 2% target, has peaked.
Following last month's strong core PPI readings, some economists said it was too soon talk about a sustained moderation in the monthly pace of core inflation. Based on the CPI and PPI data, economists are estimating that the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose by about 0.3% in March after climbing 0.4% in February.

The core PCE price index is one of the inflation measures watched by Fed officials. It is forecast increasing by 5.3% year-on-year in March after accelerating 5.4% in February, which was the biggest rise since 1983.
""We would caution however that the 'peak' in core inflation could appear to be more of a 'plateau' over the coming months,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""While core PCE might not climb any higher on a year-on-year basis, we would not expect the Fed would be particularly comfortable with stable 5% inflation.""

Investing.com -- U.S. producer prices surged again in March racing past expectations with their biggest monthly gain in 10 years. 
The producer price index rose by 1.4%, compared to expectations for 1.1%. That took the annual rate of inflation for goods leaving U.S. factories to a record high of 11.2%. February's data were also revised up to show an increase of 0.9%, from an initially reported 0.8%.
The data suggests that U.S. producers are still finding it relatively easy to pass on increases in costs for labor and raw materials, rather than accept any compression to their profit margins. Moreover, price increases weren't confined to volatile elements such as food and energy. Even stripped of these, the 'core PPI' index rose 1.0% on the month for the second time in three months, while the annual rate rose to 9.2% from 8.7%.
As such, they raise the pressure on the Federal Reserve to accelerate its planned tightening of monetary policy.
""With a new wave of lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine raging on...risks to the inflation outlook remain firmly to the upside, reaffirming our view that the Fed must proceed with a faster pace of policy normalization in the months ahead,"" said Oxford Economics' Mahir Rasheed in a note to clients, adding that he expected the ""severe imbalance between robust demand and handicapped supply"" to persist throughout the second quarter. Price pressures will only start to abate ""in the latter part of 2022,"" he added. 
The numbers came on the same day as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon warned of ""significant geopolitical and economic challenges ahead due to high inflation, supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine,” although he added that he remained optimistic for the U.S. economy in the short term. JPMorgan's quarterly results showed its lending to corporates rose only 2% on the year in the three months through March, but Dimon noted that the bank is seeing a pick-up in both new loan demand and in the use of revolving credit facilities.

18,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 05:55AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's imports unexpectedly fell in March as COVID-19 curbs across large parts of the country hampered freight arrivals and weakened domestic demand, while export growth slowed, prompting analysts to expect a worsening in trade in the second quarter.
The softer trade figures are likely to reinforce expectations of more policy support from the government, with an adviser on Wednesday calling for cuts in banks' reserve requirements and interest rates to boost a flagging economy.
Inbound shipments fell 0.1% in March from a year earlier, marking the first decline since August 2020, customs data showed on Wednesday. That compared with a 15.5% gain in the first two months of the year and an 8% increase forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll.
The decline was broad-based. China's imports of crude oil tumbled 14% in March and gas import volumes were the lowest since October 2020. Purchases of copper fell 8.8%, as COVID outbreaks hurt manufacturing and industrial demand for some raw materials remained soft.
Exports - a major driver of the economy - rose 14.7% in March, beating analyst expectations for a 13% rise, although slowing from a 16.3% gain in January-February. 
""Due to the severe disruptions in factory operations, road transport and port congestion as a result of the worst COVID-19 wave and the most severe lockdowns since spring 2020, we expect export growth in dollar terms to slump to 0.0% year-on-year in April, while import growth is likely to drop further to minus 3.0%,"" Nomura said in a note.
Many analysts expect trade conditions to worsen in April, on slower customs clearance and as the impact from a lockdown in Shanghai is felt.
China's efforts to curb its largest COVID-19 outbreaks in two years have restricted activity in several cities including Shanghai and forced companies from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn to automakers Toyota and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) to suspend some operations.
That likely reduced demand for imported raw materials for Chinese factories, according to Zheng Houcheng, director of the Yingda Securities Research Institute.
""The pressure on the global economy is likely to drive down commodity prices over the medium-term, which would hit China's exports, in both volume and value, in the second half,"" said Zheng.
China's strong trade performance seen over the past two years is set to slow this year as other countries emerge from COVID lockdowns and higher energy prices and global logistics disruptions caused by Russia's war in Ukraine squeeze exporters.
Factory activity in March fell as the declines in export orders accelerated, recent manufacturing surveys showed, with firms reporting clients cancelled or suspended orders due to the uncertainty over the Ukraine war.
Qi Yong, general manager at a consumer electronics distributor Shenzhen Muchen Technology Co, told Reuters that orders from European clients fell 20% in March from a year ago, although outbound shipments for North America remained brisk. 

Qi said this was due to ""the war-induced weak purchasing power and risks of economic slowdowns in European economies"", adding that ""exporters with exposure to the bloc may continue to feel the pinch"".
China posted a trade surplus of $47.38 billion in March, more than double the forecast $22.4 billion, thanks to the unexpected decline in imports. It reported a $115.95 billion surplus in January-February.

19,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 05:11AM ET</span>","BERLIN (Reuters) -Germany would face a sharp recession if gas supplies from Russia are suddenly cut off, the country's leading economic institutes said on Wednesday, and the government said the war in Ukraine poses ""substantial risks"" for Europe's largest economy.
A sudden stop in Russian energy supplies - an adverse scenario and not the institutes' baseline expectation - would slow economic growth to 1.9% this year and result in a contraction of 2.2% in 2023, they said.
The chairmen of three German parliamentarian committees called on Tuesday for the European Union to impose an embargo on Russian oil as soon as possible. But a survey published on Wednesday showed most Germans baulk at that idea.
""If gas supplies were to be cut off, the German economy would undergo a sharp recession,"" said Stefan Kooths, vice president and research director business cycles and growth at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.
The cumulative loss of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2022 and 2023 in the event of a such supply freeze would likely be around 220 billion euros ($238 billion), or more than 6.5% of annual economic output, the five institutes said.
In its monthly report, Germany's Economy Ministry said the war in Ukraine ""poses substantial risks"" for the economy, but it was hard to quantify effects: ""They depend heavily on the duration and intensity of the war,"" it said.
The economic institutes - the RWI in Essen, the DIW in Berlin, the Ifo in Munich, the IfW in Kiel and Halle's IWH - confirmed revised forecasts reported by Reuters on Tuesday, cutting their baseline 2022 growth projection for the economy to 2.7% from 4.8% and forecasting 2023 growth of 3.1%.
The Economy Ministry said that in coming months the inflation rate driven by energy prices and the uncertainty caused by the Russian intervention in Ukraine are likely to weigh on private consumption.

Trade flows and supply chainss have been affected by the war, it said, adding: ""Uncertainty about future economic developments remains correspondingly high.""

LONDON (Reuters) -British consumer price inflation leapt to its highest level in three decades last month, intensifying the pressure on embattled Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his finance minister Rishi Sunak to ease the cost-of-living squeeze.
The annual inflation rate climbed to 7.0% in March from 6.2% in February, its highest since March 1992 and by more than expected by most economists in a Reuters poll, official data showed on Wednesday. 
The month-on-month rise was the highest for the time of year since the Office for National Statistics' records began in 1988.
Broad-based price rises, ranging from vehicle fuel to food and furniture, were behind the increase.
Households are facing the biggest cost-of-living squeeze since records began in the 1950s, according to Britain's budget forecasters, and the inflation overshoot is further bad news for the government too.
Johnson and Sunak were fined by police on Tuesday for attending a June 2020 birthday party for Johnson at his Downing Street office at a time of COVID-19 restrictions, leading to calls from political opponents for them to resign.
Sunak - previously seen as a leading candidate to succeed Johnson as prime minister - has seen his popularity slide after a budget statement in March, which the public judged did too little to ease cost-of-living pressures, and recent revelations of his wife's tax avoidance.
""I know this is a worrying time for many families which is why we are taking action to ease the burdens by providing support worth around 22 billion pounds ($29 billion) in this financial year,"" Sunak said after the data.
Jack Leslie, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said Sunak would come under pressure to do more.
""The sheer scale of this inflation-led squeeze on living standards makes it all the more remarkable how little support the Chancellor provided in his Spring Statement - a decision that will surely have to be revisited before the Autumn Budget,"" Leslie said.
British inflation has seen an unprecedented rise over the past year, following a similar pattern to most other advanced economies as energy prices surged and pandemic supply-chain difficulties persisted.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 has pushed energy prices even higher, and last month Britain's Office for Budget Responsibility forecast inflation would peak at a 40-year high of 8.7% in the final quarter of 2022.
RISING RATES
Financial markets are all but certain the Bank of England will raise interest rates to 1% from 0.75% on May 5 before taking them to 2%-2.25% by the end of 2022, though many economists expect it to be less aggressive.
The BoE forecasts economic growth will slow sharply over the course of this year as cost of living pressures mount.
Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, forecast inflation will hit 8.8% in April after household utility bills rocketed but then fall below the BoE's 2% target in the second half of next year. 
""The MPC (Monetary Policy Committee), therefore, still has good grounds for arguing that a further substantial tightening of monetary policy would do little to restrain inflation in the near term but would run the unnecessary risk of pushing it substantially below the 2% target next year,"" Tombs said.
Wednesday's data showed that core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco prices, rose to 5.7% in March from 5.2% in February.
Retail price inflation -- an older measure which the ONS says is inaccurate, but which is widely used in commercial contracts and to set interest payments on inflation-linked government bonds -- rose to 9.0%, its highest since 1991.
There were signs of further inflation pressure ahead as manufacturers increased their prices by 11.9% over the 12 months to March, the biggest jump since September 2008.

Manufacturers' raw material costs leapt by 19.2%, the biggest increase in records began in 1997.

Investing.com -- The worldwide surge in energy and food prices struck again on Wednesday, driving U.K. inflation to its highest in over 30 years in March and adding to a growing cost-of-living crisis in the country.
Prices at both the consumer and producer level both surged by more than expected for the sixth month in a row, pushing the annual rate of consumer inflation to 7.0% and leaving factory gate inflation at 11.9%. In month-on-month terms, consumer prices rose 1.1% and producer prices rose 2.0%.  
As in many countries, prices are rising considerably faster than wages. Data released on Tuesday showed that average earnings including bonuses rose 5.4% in the year through February.
The numbers are likely to get even worse in April, as a big jump in regulated household energy prices comes into effect.  The timing of that is particularly awkward for the U.K. government, which also implemented an increase in national insurance contributions from April 1. A subsequent cut in income tax the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak may cushion that blow a little, however. 
The figures come a day after inflation in the U.S. hit a 40-year high of 8.5%, due largely to gasoline, food and housing prices, and on the same day that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand became the first major advanced economy central bank since the start of the pandemic to raise its key rate by 50 basis points. 
As such, the Bank of England is likely to come under fresh pressure to act more aggressively to bring inflation down. After its latest interest rate hike, the Bank had signaled that it expected the economy to cool by itself later in the year, making the prospect of continued increases in rates less likely. The pound was nonetheless little changed at $1.2995 by 2:45 AM ET (0645 GMT), however.  There was more movement in U.K. government bonds, where the yields on the 2-Year and 10-Year Gilts rose by 4 and 7 basis points respectively to 1.57% and 1.87%.
Simon French, chief economist with Panmure Gordon, said via Twitter that he saw ""nothing in today's UK CPI release for March to change our view that CPI will peak this year at around 10%.""
He highlighted ""signs of a broadening of inflationary pressures amongst core items and a big leap in input costs.""
French said he thought the most likely path for the BoE at its May meeting is still a 25 basis point hike and the announcement of a path for unwinding its purchases of U.K. government bonds. However, he said that global developments make a 50 basis point hike ""no longer a long shot."""

Investing.com – Chinese exports continued their growth trajectory in the first quarter of 2022, but the war in Ukraine and the latest COVID-19 outbreak in the country could mean that this growth will slow down soon.
Meanwhile, imports fell as the recent record numbers of COVID-19 cases and the ensuing lockdowns in the country weakened domestic consumption.
Exports grew 14.7% year-on-year in March 2022, beating forecasts by Investing.com that predicted a 13% growth. A growth of 16.3% was reported during the previous month. Imports contracted 0.1% year-on-year, in contrast to Investing.com forecasts that predicted growth of 8% and well below the previous month’s 15.5% figure.
China’s strong trade performance over the past two years is set for a slowdown in 2022, as other countries loosen COVID-19 restrictive measures. Soaring energy prices and global supply snarls caused by the war in Ukraine continue to impact exporters.
Qi Yong, general manager at a consumer electronics distributor Shenzhen Muchen Technology Co., told Reuters that although export orders from the company’s European clients dropped 20% in March from a year ago, exports to North America remained brisk.
This was due to ""the war-induced weak purchasing power and risks of economic slowdowns in European economies,"" and ""exporters with exposure to the EU may continue to feel the pinch,” said Qi.
Meanwhile, the trade balance stood at $47.38 billion, which exceeded Investing.com's predictions of $22.4 billion but was smaller than the combined $115.95 billion figure for January and February.
“Generally speaking, China’s foreign trade got off to a smooth start in the first quarter of this year, laying a good foundation for achieving the target for the whole year,” according to General Administration of Customs spokesman Li Kuiwen.
“But at the same time, we should also see that there are some unexpected, sudden factors in the current international and domestic environments, the external environment of foreign trade is becoming more severe, development faces many risks and challenges, and coupled with the high base last year, greater efforts should be made to achieve the goal of foreign trade for 2022.”"

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders posted their biggest monthly fall in nearly two years in February, official data showed on Wednesday, dragged down by a steep drop in demand from IT and other service firms to extend their decline into a second month.
The data added to concerns that Japanese firms are holding off on investments due to rising energy and raw materials costs, fuelling fears about the pace of economic growth as the world's third-largest economy tries to recover to pre-pandemic levels.
""Companies are worried about surging costs due to raw material price inflation that could damage profits. The risk of capital expenditure slowdown ahead is huge,"" said Kota Suzuki, economist at Daiwa Securities.
Core machinery orders, a highly volatile leading indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, fell 9.8% in February from the previous month, the Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday, the biggest drop since April 2020.
It was far larger than a fall of 1.5% forecast by economists in a Reuters poll and January's 2.0% decrease, and prompted the government to downgrade its assessment of machinery orders, saying a recovery was stalling.
Core orders from non-manufacturers excluding ships and electrical utilities fell 14.4% in February, led by a 36.9% fall in orders from information technology service firms, the biggest drop since January 2006. 
""The information service sector has been aggressive in buying computers for IT systems and data centre facilities since last October, and the movement appears to have stalled,"" a government official told a media briefing.
""It was a surprising, mixed result that highlighted weakness across non-manufacturers,"" said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities, who also noted weak demand from the transport and financial sectors.
Orders from manufacturers fell 1.8%, hurt by soft demand from chemicals and other material industries. Orders from electric machinery firms grew 13.8% as they ramped up investments in semiconductor-making equipment.
On a year-on-year basis, core orders rose 4.3% in February, the data showed, much weaker than a 14.5% rise expected by economists.
""In March and beyond, companies could turn more cautious and reduce machinery orders on the Ukraine crisis-caused slowdown in the global economy and commodity rally,"" said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
Rattled by supply disruptions and soaring production costs, Japanese business confidence worsened in the first quarter for the first time in nearly two years, a Bank of Japan survey showed this month.
Managers of major Japanese firms expected the near-term recovery outlook to stay modest at best, on uncertainties such as the Ukraine crisis and its impact on commodity inflation, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday. 

Economists have cut projections for Japan's growth, in view of the heightening inflationary pressures on households and businesses.
""The rebound in April-June consumption may not be as strong as expected on rising energy and food prices,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. ""Companies, too, could limit spending.""

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment released on Wednesday dipped 0.9% in April from March, when it slid 4.2%. The index was down 19.6% from April last year at 95.8, and almost back to where it was pre-pandemic.
The survey suggested the government's Budget in March had a limited impact on the national mood, even though it contained pre-election tax breaks and cuts to fuel excise.
Widespread flooding across the east coast also had some effect on sentiment.
""There is further evidence that interest rates, inflation and weather continued to unnerve consumers in the current survey,"" said Westpac chief economist Bill Evans.
He noted sentiment among people with a home loan fell a steep 9.2% in April amid speculation the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) could raise interest rates as early as June.
Some 70.0% of respondents expected a rise in rates in the next 12 months, the highest level since August 2016 when the question was first included in the survey.
That, coupled with high prices for petrol, housing and food, saw the survey's measure of family finances compared with a year ago drop 4.8%, while the outlook for finances over the next 12 months fell 0.9%.

Likewise, the survey's measure of whether it was a good time to buy a major household item sank 5.3%, and is down 20% on a year ago.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. monthly consumer prices increased by the most in 16-1/2 years in March as Russia's war against Ukraine boosted the cost of gasoline to record highs, cementing the case for a 50 basis points interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve next month.
The acceleration in prices reported by the Labor Department on Tuesday culminated in annual inflation rising at its fastest pace since the end of 1981. But there is cautious hope that the worst of the post-pandemic inflation surge is behind.
Monthly underlying inflation pressures moderated as goods prices, excluding food and energy, dropped by the most in two years. Further declines in the so-called core goods prices are likely as demand shifts back to services amid the rolling back of COVID-19 restrictions on businesses.
""The Fed will take a tiny bit of comfort from today's report, but it still has much work to do to restore price stability,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. 
The consumer price index jumped 1.2% last month, the biggest monthly gain since September 2005. The CPI advanced 0.8% in February. An 18.3% surge in gasoline prices, the largest since June 2009, accounted for more than half the increase in the CPI. 
Gasoline prices at the pump on average soared to an all-time high of $4.33 per gallon in March, according to AAA. Inflation was already a headache before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, which unleashed a barrage of sanctions, including the banning of Russian oil imports by the United States.
Americans are not the only ones reeling from high inflation, which was initially fueled by huge amounts of money doled out by governments across the globe to cushion against the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic. 
The Russia-Ukraine war, now in its second month, has led to a global surge in food prices as the two nations also are major exporters of commodities like wheat and sunflower oil.
""If not for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's imperialist ambitions, inflation would still have accelerated this month, though not nearly as much,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. 
Inflation increased broadly last month, with food prices rising 1.0%. The cost of food consumed at home climbed 1.5% as all grocery categories posted big gains. Groceries increased 10% on a year-on-year basis, the most in 41 years. But the cost of dining out grew less, with prices of food consumed away from home rising 0.3%, the smallest gain in a year.
In the 12 months through March, the CPI accelerated 8.5%, the largest year-on-year gain since December 1981, after a 7.9% jump in February. It was the sixth straight month of annual CPI readings north of 6%. Last month's increase in inflation was in line with economists' expectations.
Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell. 
MONTHLY CORE CPI SLOWS 
The strong CPI readings followed on the heels of news last month that the unemployment rate fell to a new two-year low of 3.6% in March.
The U.S. central bank in March raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years. Minutes of the policy meeting published last Wednesday appeared to set the stage for big rate increases down the road. The Fed is expected to soon begin trimming its asset portfolio. 
High inflation and the Fed's hawkish posture have left the bond market fearing a U.S. recession, though most economists expect the expansion will continue.
Many believe March could mark the peak in the annual CPI rate, but caution that inflation would remain well above the Fed's 2% target at least through 2023. Gasoline prices have retreated from record highs and last year's high inflation readings will also start falling from the CPI calculation.
There is also a sense that consumers, confronted with declining purchasing power, are becoming more price conscious, which could make it harder for businesses to pass on higher price. Inflation-adjusted weekly earnings fell 1.1% in March.
A second straight monthly decline in prices of used cars and trucks restrained the core CPI to a 0.3% rise after increasing 0.5% in February. Core goods fell 0.4%, the biggest drop since April 2020. That blunted part of a 0.5% gain in shelter costs, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of the rise in core CPI.
While a key measure of rents, owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, advanced, the pace slowed a bit to 0.43% from 0.45% in February. The core CPI rose 6.5% in the 12 months through March, the largest gain since August 1982, after advancing 6.4% in February.
Though demand for goods is cooling, increased appetite for services will keep inflation simmering. Further disruptions to supply chains from the Russia-Ukraine war and lockdowns in China to contain a resurgence in COVID-19 infections are also seen keeping prices for some goods elevated. Workers, squeezed by inflation, are demanding large wage increases.

Prices for hotel and motel accommodation increased strongly last month. Airline fares soared 10.7%. Household furnishings also cost more and did motor vehicle insurance, apparel, recreation and personal care. The cost of healthcare rose 0.5%, with both doctor visits and hospital services increasing solidly. But prescription medication prices fell 0.2%.
""We expect demand for goods to waver as spending pivots back toward services, and this transition should temper goods inflation,"" said Michael Pugliese, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in New York. ""Pent-up demand for travel should lead to a few more months of solid gains for airfare and lodging prices, but there will likely be less scope for catch-up come autumn.""

The Treasury said March outlays were $508 billion, down 45% from March 2021, while receipts jumped 18% to $315 billion, a new March record, reflecting a strong U.S. economic recovery.
The March 2021 deficit of $660 billion had been a record for the month, driven by direct payments of $1,400 to millions of Americans under last year's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act.
For the first six months of the 2022 fiscal year that started on Oct. 1, the Treasury reported a deficit of $668 billion, a 61% drop from the year-ago period.

Year-to-date outlays fell 18% from the first half of fiscal 2021 to $2.79 trillion, while receipts grew 25% to $2.122 trillion, a new first-half record.
The March receipts were driven largely by increases in individual withheld and non-withheld income taxes, reflecting lower unemployment levels compared to a year ago, Treasury official said.

MAZEN ISSA, SENIOR FX STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, NEW YORK 
“There was a lot of focus on this print and it was being chalked up to be a very spicy print and that did not disappoint, especially the headline measure. I think the focus here will be that expectations for the core measure, albeit very high expectations, were underwhelmed.”
“Ultimately, I don’t really think that this inflation print really changes the price action in the FX space, because at the end of the day, we’re still sitting at 6.5% year-over-year core inflation and despite the slight moderation, it’s likely to remain elevated for the next several prints. And so, ultimately the forces that are justifying robust tightening by the Fed remain very much in place.”
THOMAS HAYES, CHAIRMAN, GREAT HILL CAPITAL, NEW YORK
“You're seeing futures are up because everyone came into this report expecting that inflation would be a lot higher than anticipated. And what we're actually seeing is that the core CPI, they came in slightly lower than expected, particularly month-on-month core CPI. And that's a very good thing because you really saw yields blowing out ahead of this event.”
“This is a very positive report for stocks and particularly for tech stocks, the long duration equities which have been left for dead as the 10-year yield spiked. This may be a short-term peak in yields and it may be an opportunity to get meaningful exposure into tech as it starts to finally get bid once again along with bonds.”
MICHAEL O’ROURKE, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST AT JONESTRADING, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT 
    ""The numbers were basically in line with expectations. This is expected to be the high print for year-over-year CPI for the cycle. When we get this month's reading and you know subsequent readings they should be lower levels than 8.5%.""
    ""Considering the stock and bond sell-off coming into the number and the numbers are basically in line with expectations, we're getting a nice buy-the-news relief rally ... it should not change any expectations for monetary policy.""
PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“Top line was ugly but the core rate was lower than we expected. This is not good news, but yields are coming off their high indicative of another bloodbath in the debt market.”
“The bottom line is inflation is going to stick around for a while, but we could see it begin to reverse in the summer months, provided we get some cooling off in agricultural and energy prices.”

“(Stock) futures are gaining strength, the market anticipated these numbers yesterday. Stocks are likely to have a positive trading session in anticipation of the banking earnings.”
“It’s nearly written in the stone that we’ll see a 50-basis-point rate hike in May and another in June. The Fed is behind the curve.”

Investing.com -- U.S. inflation hit a new 40-year high of 8.5% in March, as sharp rises in prices for gasoline, housing and food all heaped pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy.
The consumer price index rose 1.2% on the month, in line with analysts' expectations, over half of which was accounted for by an 18.3% increase in gasoline prices. Pump prices hit all-time highs last month, according to the American Automobile Association and have only partly receded in the last month as the Biden administration released millions of barrels from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to bring prices down. The AAA's average gas price stood at $4.09 a gallon on Monday, down from a peak of $4.33 a month ago.
Gas prices weren't the only thing pushing inflation higher, however. Food costs rose another 1.0% for the second month in a row, and transportation services (which include airfares) rose a seasonally-adjusted 2.0% on the month. 
There was a glimmer of light on the horizon, in as much as core prices - which strip out volatile food and energy costs - rose only 0.3%, a little less than the expected 0.5%. The annual core rate of inflation consequently rose only to 6.5%, rather than the 6.6% expected. 
In addition, there was fresh evidence that some of the outlandish movements in prices caused by the pandemic and ensuing supply chain constraints are now reversing. Used car prices, which had spiked last year as manufacturers were left unable to produce new ones due to component shortages, fell 3.8%, their second straight monthly drop. They're still up over 35% year-on-year however.
Analysts have estimated that headline inflation may have peaked in March as the base effects from 12 months ago become more favorable. However, the specter of supply chain disruption hasn't disappeared. Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) have both had to idle plants in Michigan in the last month due to ongoing shortages, and Covid-19 lockdowns in China are affecting an ever-wider circle of businesses. Analysts at Nomura estimate that over 370 million Chinese in 45 cities are currently subjected to some form of restrictions. That includes a near-total lockdown of Shanghai, home to China's biggest port.
Despite that, financial markets were eager to jump on anything offering hope of relief from what is likely to be the most rapid tightening of U.S. monetary policy since 1994. By 8:55 AM ET (1255 GMT), S&P 500 Futures were up 27 points, or 0.6% from immediately before the release, adding to overnight gains. The yield on the two-year U.S. Treasury note, meanwhile, fell 8 basis points to 2.43%, its sharpest drop in nearly seven weeks."
29,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 08:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer prices rose in March by the most since late 1981, bolstering expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by half a point next month.
The consumer price index increased 8.5% from a year earlier following a 7.9% annual gain in February, Labor Department data showed Tuesday. The widely followed inflation gauge rose 1.2% from a month earlier, the biggest gain since 2005. Gasoline costs drove half of the monthly increase.
Economists in a Bloomberg survey called for the overall CPI to increase 8.4% from a year ago and 1.2% from February.
The March CPI reading represents what many economists expect to be the peak of the current inflationary period, capturing the impact of soaring food and energy prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While the Fed is shifting as such to more hawkish policy, inflation isn’t likely to recede to the central bank’s 2% goal anytime soon -- especially given the war, Covid-19 lockdowns in China and greater demand for services like travel.
At the same time, risks that inflation will tip the economy into recession are building. A growing chorus of economists predict that activity will contract either because consumer spending declines in response to higher prices, or the Fed will over-correct in its effort to catch up. However, the majority still expects the economy to grow.

30,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 06:16AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. small business confidence fell in March, with the share of owners reporting that inflation was their single most important problem the largest since 1981, a survey showed on Tuesday. 
The National Federation of Independent Business said its Small Business Optimism Index dropped 2.4 points to 93.2 last month, the third straight month of readings below the 48-year average of 98. The index has declined every month this year.
Thirty-one percent of owners identified inflation as their single most important problem, up 5 points from February. This was the biggest share since the first quarter of 1981 and replaced worries about ""labor quality"" as the No. 1 problem confronting small businesses.
The economy is experiencing high inflation caused by shortages, massive fiscal stimulus and low interest rates.
Annual inflation is rising at the fastest pace in 40 years. The Federal Reserve last month raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years. Minutes of the policy meeting published last Wednesday appeared to set the stage for big rate increases down the road.
According to the NFIB survey, the share of owners raising average selling prices increased 4 points to a record high of 72% last month. It noted that ""price-raising activity over the past 12 months has continued to escalate, reaching levels not seen since the early 1980s when prices were rising at double digit rates."" Price increases were across all industries.
Half of business owners planned to raise prices, up 4 points from February. Wage inflation could also pick up.

Forty-seven percent of owners reported job openings they could not fill, down 1 point from February but far above the 48-year historical average of 23%. The share of businesses reporting raising compensation dipped one point to 49%. About 28% planned to raise compensation in the next three months, up 2 points from February. 
Twenty-two percent of owners said that labor quality was their top business problem, unchanged from February.

The ZEW economic research institute said its economic sentiment index fell to -41.0 points from -39.3 in March. A Reuters poll had pointed to a reading of -48.0 for April.
""The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment remains at a low level. The experts are pessimistic about the current economic situation and assume that it will continue to deteriorate,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement.
""The decline in inflation expectations, which cuts the previous month's considerable increase by about half, gives some cause for hope. However, the prospect of stagflation over the next six months remains,"" he added.
An index for current conditions fell to -30.8 from -21.4. The consensus forecast was for a reading of -35.0.
The ZEW data echo other weak economic reports from Germany following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which began on Feb. 24.
Late last month, the German government's council of economic advisers more than halved its 2022 growth forecast for Europe's largest economy to 1.8% and flagged a ""substantial"" recession risk as a result of the invasion.
German business morale also plummeted in March as companies worried about rising energy prices, driver shortages and the stability of supply chains in the wake of the war in Ukraine.
Separate data on Tuesday showed Germany's annual harmonised consumer price inflation (HICP) rate ran at 7.6% in March. Wholesale prices rose by 22.6% on the year, the highest annual rate since the calculation of the data began in 1962.
""Germany is threatened with recession,"" said Thomas Gitzel, chief economist at VP Bank. ""Germany, with its export-heavy industry and dependence on intermediate goods from Asia, is without weather protection in a raging logistics hurricane.""

Germany plans to offer more than 100 billion euros ($108.63 billion) worth of aid to companies hit by fallout from the war in Ukraine, according to a document from the finance and economy ministries seen by Reuters last Friday.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britons' earnings shrank by the most since 2013 in February when adjusted for surging inflation, despite unemployment falling to its joint lowest in almost 50 years, highlighting the challenges facing the Bank of England.
The jobless rate sank to 3.8% in the three months to February from 3.9% before, official figures showed, matching a rate last seen in late 2019 and one that has not been lower since 1974.
Annual growth in average earnings excluding bonuses picked up to 4.0% from 3.8% but fell short of rising inflation - which hit 6.2% in February - and led to a 1.3% drop in its real value, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
""Soaring inflation is casting a big shadow over an otherwise buoyant labour market,"" Nye Cominetti, an economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said. 
Compared with before the pandemic, British employers are struggling to hire and job vacancies rose to a record high of 1.288 million in the first quarter of 2022. 
The tight labour market is making many Bank of England (BoE) policymakers fear that Britain's currently high inflation - pushed up by energy prices and post-pandemic supply-chain difficulties - could become entrenched.
The BoE has raised interest rates three times since December, more than any other big central bank, and markets expect it do so again at its next meeting in May.
But the BoE also fears growth will slow sharply this year as the squeeze on living standards intensifies.
Government budget forecasters predict inflation will peak at nearly 9% at the end of the year, and that living standards are set to see their biggest fall since records began in the late 1950s once the effect of April's payroll tax rises are included.
Figures due on Wednesday are expected to show consumer prices rose by 6.7% in the 12 months to March.
SLOWER EMPLOYMENT GROWTH
Tuesday's data showed employment growth was slowing, possibly as a result of firms' concerns about the outlook for demand as well as the difficulty in securing staff.
Employment in the three months to February rose by 10,000, far less than the 50,000 forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. 
The number of job vacancies rose by the smallest amount in nearly a year, while a separate tax office measure of the number of employees on company payrolls rose by 35,000 in March - a lot fewer than February's downwardly revised reading of 174,000.
Also on Tuesday, British retailers reported weaker annual sales growth for March, reflecting growing pressure on consumer spending as well as the timing of Easter.
Reduced immigration from the European Union since post-Brexit restrictions came into force in January 2021 has also increased hiring difficulties for some employers. 

Overall, the number of people in Britain's workforce has fallen by 655,000 since the start of the pandemic - due to a rise in long-term sickness to its joint-highest rate in 20 years, as well as early retirement.
""The jury's out on exactly why this is - or indeed how long it might last - but in the meantime it's adding to labour shortages,"" James Smith, an economist at Dutch bank ING, said.

Investing.com -- Experts' expectations for the German economy darkened again in April, as a closely-watched sentiment index fell to its lowest level since March 2020. 
The ZEW Economic Sentiment index fell to -41.0 from -39.3 the previous month. It had plummeted in March in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions imposed by the West on Russia in response to that have caused sharp downward revisions to this year's growth forecasts for Europe's largest economy. 
However, the decline in the index was not as bad as expected. The consensus forecast had been for a drop to -48, which would have been only a whisker above its lowest ever reading at the start of the pandemic. The positive surprise was due largely to the assessment of current conditions staying more robust than expected. That subindex fell from -21.4 to only -30.8, instead of the -35 expected.
""There is a little shimmer of light in the decline of inflation expectations,"" said Achim Wambach, head of the ZEW think tank. ""However, the prospect of stagflation in the next six months is still real."" 
The release comes on the same day that the German Federal Statistical Office, Destatis, confirmed that consumer price inflation rose to 7.3% in March (or 7.6% according to the harmonized EU measure), from 5.5% in February. That's the highest in over 30 years. Other measures of inflation suggest that there are still substantial price pressures in the pipeline, as producers and retailers pass on higher costs for energy and other inputs. Wholesale price inflation rose 6.9% on the month and 22.6% on the year in March, Destatis said. Producer prices meanwhile, rose 25.9% in the year through March.
The ZEW is the first of Europe's important sentiment surveys to be published every month. It's drawn from the opinions of professional economists. "

Swiss exports to the United States hit a record 46.95 billion Swiss francs ($50.42 billion) last year after growing by an average of 6.3% per year since 2001, three times faster than the No.2 and No.3 export markets, Germany and Italy.
Germany had been the Alpine country's biggest export market since 1954.
Growth of Swiss exports to the United States was mostly driven by chemical and pharmaceutical products whose shipments rose to 30.1 billion francs last year from 4.3 billion francs in 2001, equivalent to almost two-thirds of exports to the U.S. market, the customs office said.
Machines and electronics were the second-biggest category, representing 8.3% of total exports to the United States, followed by precision instruments and watches.

Exports likely rose 13% in March versus a year earlier, compared with 16.3% year-on-year growth for the January-February period, according to a median forecast in a Reuters poll of 19 economists.
Imports in March were estimated as 8% higher than a year before, the poll showed, easing from 15.5% growth seen in the first two months of the year. The slowdown in growth was partly driven by sluggish domestic demand and by production disruptions, both caused by ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks, analysts say.
Chinese economic data for January and February is often combined to remove distortions caused by the shifting timing of the Lunar New Year holiday.
Economists in the poll expect a March trade surplus of $22.4 billion, compared with $13.8 billion a year earlier.
The trade data will be released on Wednesday.
While COVID outbreaks and resulting restrictions in such major manufacturing locations as Jiangsu, Guangdong and Shanghai have probably slowed export growth, the Ukraine war is denting global economic recovery and disrupting logistics, analysts say. 
The Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, which focuses on small manufacturing firms in coastal regions, indicated contraction in March, with a sub-index of new export orders dropping to a 22-month low.
Container throughput at eight major Chinese ports grew 1.8% year-on-year in March, slower than February's 2.8% growth, data by the domestic port association showed.
China's efforts to curb its largest COVID-19 outbreaks in the two years have restricted activity in several cities and in March forced companies from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn to automakers Toyota and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) to suspend some operations.
Nomura said in a note that China, the world's largest manufacturer, had been facing a rising risk of recession since mid-March. It added that, as of Monday, 45 cities had implemented either full or partial lockdowns covering 26.4% of China's population and 40.3% of its GDP.

Amid constrained supply, factory-gate inflation rose faster than expected in March, raising questions among some analysts about just how much the central bank will be able to ease monetary policy.
Some analysts, noting economic headwinds from the pandemic, still expect further policy easing. But ANZ Research analysts said in a note on Tuesday that the only viable way to boost the economy was to relax measures that hold down the real estate sector.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's wholesale inflation remained near record-high levels in March as the Ukraine crisis and a weak yen pushed up fuel and raw material costs, data showed on Tuesday, adding strains to the resource-poor economy heavily reliant on imports.
While rising wholesale prices will help accelerate consumer inflation toward the central bank's elusive 2% target, it could hurt an economy still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, analysts say.
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge each other for their goods and services, rose 9.5% in March from a year earlier, data showed.
That followed a revised 9.7% spike in February, which was the fastest pace on record, and exceeded a median market forecast for a 9.3% gain. The March index, at 112.0, was the highest level since December 1982, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) said.
""With raw material costs rising so much, companies won't be able to make money unless they raise prices. The days of discount war are over,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Core consumer inflation may accelerate to around 2.5% later this year and stay above 2% for longer than initially expected, weighing on consumption and the economy,"" he said.
The yen-based import price index jumped 33.4% in March from a year earlier, the data showed, a sign the yen's recent declines are inflating the cost of imports for Japanese firms.
Japanese companies have been slow in passing on rising costs to households as soft wage growth weighed on consumption, keeping consumer inflation well below the BOJ's 2% target.

But analysts expect core consumer inflation to accelerate around 2% from April due to surging fuel costs and the dissipating effect of past cellphone fee cuts.
The rising inflationary pressure heightens the chance the BOJ will revise up its inflation forecast at its next quarterly review due April 28, analysts say. The bank's current forecast is for core consumer inflation to hit 1.1% in the year that began in April.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A measure of Australian business conditions picked up sharply in March as firms saw strong sales and labour conditions, while surging costs pushed retail prices higher in a worrying sign for inflation.
Tuesday's survey from National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) (NAB) showed its index of business conditions doubled to +18 in March, while confidence added 3 points to +16.
The upbeat result will likely be welcomed by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who is in the middle of a tough election campaign.
The survey's measure of sales jumped 13 points to +24, while profitability rose 8 points to +13. The employment index added 4 points to +12, suggesting the jobless rate will soon drop under 4% for the first time since the early 1970s.
""The improvement was largely driven by the retail sector, which saw conditions rise 23 points, as well as recreation & personal services and finance, business & property,"" said NAB chief economist Alan Oster.
""Confidence jumped in the transport, construction, and recreation & personal services sectors.""
Measures of forward orders and business investment also picked up, suggesting the recovery would continue.
Inflation remained a headache with purchase costs and labour costs rising at the fastest pace in the history of the survey, which in turn pushed up retail prices.
""The continued escalation in price growth over recent months suggests a strong Q1 CPI reading is likely when released later in the month,"" said Oster.
Analysts have been warning the March quarter consumer price index would likely surprise on the high side and put pressure on the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to start raising interest rates as early as June.
A separate survey of consumers from ANZ out Tuesday showed its sentiment index picked up 1.3% last week as petrol prices cooled just a little, though it remains below average.
Inflation expectations stayed high at 5.8%, reflecting cost of living pressures from petrol, food and housing.

All that price froth has yet to deter shoppers with CBA's measure of household spending intentions jumping 9.2% in March to a record high, led by travel, transport and retail.
The strength in spending, combined with a 13-year low for unemployment, suggests the economy overall put in a solid performance in the first quarter.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) -New Zealand business confidence and demand worsened in the first quarter of this year due to the ongoing damage the COVID-19 outbreak is having on the economy, a private think tank said on Tuesday.
A net 40% of firms surveyed expected general business conditions to deteriorate compared with 28% pessimism in the previous quarter, the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research's (NZIER) quarterly survey of business opinion (QSBO) showed.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, 33% expected business conditions to worsen, versus 35% pessimism recorded in the previous period. The survey's measure of capacity utilisation rose to 97.1%, from the previous quarter's 92.7%. 

The manufacturing sector is the least pessimistic of the sectors survey but still face many challenges as Omicron's spread impacts deliveries, NZIER said in its report. 
A net 56% reported increased costs in the March quarter, it said. Overall, businesses are feeling more cautious in an environment of acute labour shortages and intense cost pressures, the report said.

39,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 12:20PM ET</span>","(Reuters) -The Russian central bank said on Monday it had temporarily suspended publishing data on foreign trade on a monthly basis in the first such suspension since 1997.
The central bank was due to release a foreign trade balance for January-February on Monday, as initially planned, according to its data release schedule. 
The central bank did not explain its decision to suspend publication of the foreign trade data, monthly figures for which can be tracked back as far as 1997 on the bank's website. 
In January, the latest data available, Russian foreign trade surplus fell to $21.17 billion from $26.72 billion in the previous month. 
Russia is under tough Western sanctions as the United States, the European Union and their allies respond to Moscow's Ukraine invasion launched on Feb. 24, which the Kremlin calls ""a special military operation."" 
The sanctions have cut Russia off from the global financial system and Western countries are stepping up the pressure by reducing Russian energy imports.
The central bank had earlier suspended weekly publication of its gold and foreign exchange reserves and also stopped disclosing banking sector statistics. 
The bank has resumed publication of this weekly data, which showed that Russian gold and forex reserves had fallen to $606.5 billion as of April 1, down from $643.2 billion days before the invasion. 

The Russian energy ministry had earlier suspended a monthly release of oil and gas output data citing technical issues. 
Russian oil and gas condensate production declined by 4% in early April from March to 10.58 barrels per day (bpd), Interfax newsagency has said, and analysts have warned of a further up to 1.5 mln bpd fall as buyers cancel cargoes.

40,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 11:15AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - U.S. consumers boosted their expectations for inflation and household spending in the year ahead as the price of gas and food steepens, but tempered their view of inflation over the medium-term, according to a survey released on Monday by the New York Federal Reserve. 
Expectations for where inflation will be in one year rose to 6.6% in March, the highest since the survey was launched in 2013 and up from 6.0% in February. Household spending was seen growing 7.7% in the year ahead, also a series high. Just 23% saw their household finances improving in the year ahead, the smallest share since the survey began. 
Americans are experiencing the worst bout of inflation in decades, and it is getting worse: economists polled by Reuters expect a report out on Tuesday will show consumer prices rose 8.4% in March, up from 7.9% in February, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine drives up food and energy prices. 
To combat 40-year-high inflation, the Federal Reserve last month raised interest rates for the first time in three years and is expected to accelerate the pace of rate hikes in coming months. The New York Fed survey suggests consumer see little short-term relief, as they anticipate the price of food, gas and medical care to rise 9.6%, and expect rent to jump 10.2%. Home prices were expected to rise 6% in the coming year, faster than the 5.7% expected last month.
But Fed policymakers are also closely tracking farther-ahead inflation expectations for signs that consumers see current price increases continuing. Monday's survey offered some comfort there: while near-term inflation expectations have soared, consumers' longer-term expectations have been less affected. 
The New York Fed's monthly survey of consumer expectations is based on a rotating panel of 1,300 households.

Consumers expressed less optimism about the labor market than in February. The average perceived odds of losing one's job over the next year rose to 11.1% from 10.8%, though it was still well below its pre-pandemic reading of 13.8%. 
Unemployment in March was 3.6%, a pandemic low and only a hair above the pre-pandemic rate of 3.5%.

BEIJING (Reuters) -New bank lending in China rose more than expected in March, while broad credit growth accelerated from the previous month as the central bank kept policy accommodative to support the slowing economy.
Chinese banks extended 3.13 trillion yuan ($492 billion) in new yuan loans in March, up sharply from February and exceeding analyst expectations, data released by the People's Bank of China on Monday showed.
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted new yuan loans would rise to 2.68 trillion yuan in March. The new loans were higher than 2.73 trillion yuan a year earlier.
That pushed bank lending in the first quarter to a record 8.34 trillion yuan, up 8.7% from 7.67 trillion yuan in the first quarter of 2021 - the previous record. 
""Bank loans and total social financing rose more than expected in March. This confirms that the government did loosen monetary policy,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.
""Strong credit supply is helpful, but the economy will likely stay weak with many cities under lockdown. The outlook of the COVID outbreaks and the zero (COVID) tolerance policy are the most important uncertainty the economy faces.""
Household loans, mostly mortgages, rose to 753.9 billion yuan in March, after contracting by 336.9 billion yuan in February, while corporate loans jumped to 2.48 trillion yuan last month from 1.24 trillion yuan in February.
China's cabinet last week held out the prospect of more measures to support the economy under pressure from renewed COVID-19 outbreaks and a slowing global recovery.
MODEST EASING EXPECTED
To spur growth, the central bank has cut interest rates and banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR), with more easing steps expected.
""Credit growth will probably continue to accelerate in the coming months amid declines in borrowing costs and support to the housing market,"" Sheana Yue at Capital Economics said in a note. 
""We think policy easing will continue in the near term,"" Yue said, expecting the central bank to cut the rate on its medium-term lending facility (MLF) by 10 basis points as early as on Friday.
Broad M2 money supply grew 9.7% in March from a year earlier, central bank data showed, above estimates of 9.2% forecast in the Reuters poll. M2 grew 9.2% in February from a year ago.
Outstanding yuan loans grew by 11.4% in March from a year earlier, compared with 11.4% growth in February. Analysts had expected 11.4% growth.
Growth of outstanding total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, quickened to 10.6% in March from a year earlier and from 10.2% in February.

TSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.
In March, TSF rose sharply to 4.65 trillion yuan from 1.19 trillion yuan in February. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected March TSF of 3.7 trillion yuan.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's economy slowed more sharply than expected in February, reflecting a hit to car production from component shortages, storm disruption and reduced health spending as households braced for a tighter cost-of-living squeeze.
Monthly gross domestic product growth was just 0.1% in February compared with 0.8% in January, the Office for National Statistics said on Monday, below the 0.3% forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.
""The news that the economy was hardly growing at all in February ... increases the risk of a contraction in GDP in the coming months as the squeeze on household real incomes intensifies,"" Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said. 
Britain's economy in February was 1.5% larger than it was two years earlier, just before the country was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, the ONS said.
GDP collapsed by more than 9% in 2020, its biggest annual fall since just after World War One, but rebounded sharply in 2021 and suffered only a modest hit from the Omicron variant of coronavirus in December.
However, economists have downgraded their growth forecasts for 2022 due to a surge in inflation caused by rising energy and commodity prices -- partly linked to the war in Ukraine -- as well as ongoing supply-chain difficulties since the pandemic.
Last month the government's Office for Budget Responsibility cut its forecast for growth in 2022 to 3.8% from 6.0% in its previous forecast in October, predicting that inflation would hit a 40-year high of 8.7% later this year.
The squeeze on households' disposable income from higher inflation and a payroll tax rise that took effect in April will be the biggest since records began in 1956/57, the OBR said.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak -- whose popularity has slumped after offering only limited support to help households in a fiscal statement last month -- said he welcomed the continued growth.
However, some analysts think the economy will shrink over the three months to June, reflecting reduced COVID-related health spending and an extra public holiday to mark Queen Elizabeth's Golden Jubilee, as well as reduced household disposable income.
""Given this weak near-term outlook for GDP growth, we continue to think that the (Bank of England) will stop increasing Bank Rate after raising it to 1.0% next month,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics's Samuel Tombs said.
Britain's dominant services sector drove monthly growth in February as the Omicron wave of coronavirus cases ebbed. 
Services output, up 0.2%, was boosted by a surge in travel bookings as COVID-19 restrictions eased, although this was largely offset by a sharp fall in health spending after COVID-19 testing and vaccination halved from January's high level.

Factory output dropped by 0.4% reflecting continued falls in car production due to component shortages and declines in other areas, while milder-than-usual winter weather depressed demand for electricity, causing power generation to fall by 1.0%.
Storms and rising materials costs hurt construction, where output fell by 0.1% on the month.
 
"
43,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 12:01AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's factory-gate and consumer prices rose faster than expected in March as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, persistent supply chain bottlenecks and production snags caused by local COVID flare-ups added to commodity cost pressures.
The surge in raw materials costs is hobbling economies worldwide and in China has raised questions among some analysts about just how much its central bank will be able to ease monetary policy.
China's producer price index (PPI) increased 8.3% year-on-year, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Monday. While that was slower than the 8.8% seen in February, it beat a forecast for a 7.9% rise in a Reuters poll.
Upstream pressures pushed up consumer prices, which rose 1.5% year-on-year, the fastest in three months, speeding up from 0.9% in February and beating expectations of 1.2%.
Nomura analysts said possible delays in crop planting caused by new COVID-19 outbreaks in the country and the Ukraine conflict could create new food price pressures in the second half of the year.
""Rising food and energy price inflation limits the space for the (People's Bank of China) to cut interest rates, despite the rapidly worsening economy,"" Nomura said in a note.
While the year-on-year PPI rise was the slowest since April 2021, this was mostly due to the lower comparisons from late 2020 and early 2021 seen in the previous months.
The monthly increase of 1.1%, meanwhile, was the fastest in five months, driven by surging prices of domestic oil and non-ferrous metals due to geopolitical factors, an NBS statement said.
Oil and gas extraction prices grew 14.1% on month, and petroleum，coal and other fuel processing prices rose 7.9%.
The uncertainty in the Ukraine war will affect global goods supply, ""adding greater imported inflation pressure on China"", said Wang Jun, chief economist at Zhongyuan Bank.
NEW RISKS
The world's second-largest economy came under downward pressure in March with renewed COVID-19 outbreaks and the manufacturing and service sectors reporting declines in activity.
Authorities have unveiled policies to support the economy, including greater fiscal spending and reductions in income tax for small firms.
While consumer prices have risen, inflation remains modest by global comparisons, pointing to weak consumption caused by Beijing's strict COVID control measures.
Against a year ago, food prices fell 1.5%, compared with a 3.9% decline in February, resulting in a drop of 0.28 percentage points in headline CPI.
China reported 26,411 new asymptomatic cases for Sunday, more than 25,000 in the financial hub of Shanghai, which is currently under a city-wide lockdown.
Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING, expects Shanghai's economy will shrink 6% this month alone if the current lockdown persists, resulting in a 2% gross domestic product decline for the whole of China.

""Although the price of some goods will remain high in the near-term, we think wider inflation will remain contained, giving the PBOC room to ease policy further,"" said Sheana Yue, China Economist at Capital Economics.
For now, most analysts expect the PBOC to lower borrowing costs, and cut reserve requirements for banks or lower interest rate to pump more cash into the economy.

44,"<span>Apr 10, 2022 09:54PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- China’s factory gate prices rose more than expected in March as oil prices climbed, putting pressure on manufacturers that are already struggling to operate amid repeated Covid outbreaks. 
The producer price index gained 8.3% from a year earlier, official data showed Monday, down from 8.8% in February and above the median estimate of an 8.1% increase in a Bloomberg survey of economists. 
Consumer-price growth accelerated to 1.5% after staying unchanged at 0.9% for two months. The reading beat economists projection of a 1.4% increase. 
China’s economic outlook worsened in March as cities and provinces locked down to control a ballooning Covid outbreak. Manufacturers in pandemic-stricken areas were forced to shutter their doors, or else keep workers on factory floors in so-called closed-loop systems so they could stay operational.
Businesses have said they faced difficulties buying raw materials, or faced extended delivery times due to supply chain disruptions. Restrictions also forced consumers to stay in their homes, as many struggled to secure daily necessities or paid high prices for goods. 
The war in Ukraine also pushed global commodities including oil higher, clouding the outlook.
Price pressures are unlikely to constrain policy makers from stepping up support for economic growth, though. Unlike major developed economies, China’s central bank is in easing mode, having cut interest rates in recent months to boost liquidity and dialed up fiscal spending. 
Authorities in recent weeks have made repeated vows to stabilize the economy as the Covid outbreak worsens, fanning speculation that a policy rate cut or other easing measure could happen soon.

(Reuters) -Egypt's annual urban consumer price inflation accelerated in March to 10.5%, its highest in nearly three years and faster than analysts had expected, data from the state statistics agency CAPMAS showed on Sunday.
The inflation figure, up from 8.8% in February, was greater than a median forecast of 10% in a Reuters poll of 14 analysts.
The price increases were caused in part by commodity shortages after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, sending inflation above the central bank's 5-9% target and its 9.25% overnight lending rate.
Some analysts expect inflation to increase by even more in the months ahead.
Core inflation, which strips out volatile items such as food, jumped to 10.1% year-on-year in March from 7.2% in February, the central bank said on Sunday, its highest since June 2018.
""The rise in inflation trends is widely expected and will peak by August 2022, after which it will start to normalise,"" said Radwa El Swaify of Pharos Securities Brokerage.
CI Capital's Sara Saada, meanwhile, said the government was expected to increase fuel prices this month.
""Accordingly, we expect monthly inflation to peak in April to record annual inflation between 12.5-13%, which reflects higher petroleum products prices,"" she said.

Naeem Research said the increase was largely attributable to higher commodity prices and the devaluation of the currency on March 21.
""With the full impacts of the Egyptian pound depreciation (of 15% versus the dollar) expected to filter down into the economy, we expect inflation to rise further in April,"" it said in a note.

The Commerce Department said on Friday wholesale inventories rose 2.5% in February, instead of 2.1% as reported last month. Stocks at wholesalers advanced 1.2% in January. Economists polled by Reuters had expected inventories would be unrevised.
Wholesale inventories surged 19.9% in February on a year-on-year basis. Inventories are a key part of gross domestic product. Wholesale motor vehicle inventories rebounded 1.4% after declining 2.3% in January. 
Wholesale inventories, excluding autos, increased 2.6% in February. This component goes into the calculation of GDP.
Inventory investment surged at a robust seasonally adjusted annualized rate of $193.2 billion in the fourth quarter, contributing 5.32 percentage points to the quarter's 6.9% growth pace. Most economists see further scope for inventories to rise, noting that inflation-adjusted inventories remain below their pre-pandemic level. Sales-to-inventory ratios are also low.
But inventories were probably not much of a boost to GDP growth in the January-March quarter as they would have needed to increase by more than the fourth quarter's pace. 

Businesses are restocking after drawing down inventories from the first quarter of 2021 through the third quarter. Growth estimates for the first quarter are mostly below a 1.0% rate. 
Sales at wholesalers increased 1.7% in February after jumping 5.0% in January. At February's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.21 months to clear shelves, up from 1.20 months in January.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada's unemployment rate fell to 5.3% in March, the lowest level on record, highlighting the tightening of the country's labor market, Statistics Canada data showed on Friday, with the economy adding a net 72,500 jobs.
The job gain was slightly below analyst predictions of 80,000, while the unemployment rate met expectations. The average hourly wage of permanent employees rose 3.7%, up from a 3.3% gain in February.
""We're beyond full employment. We're seeing the market heating up, and that shows with the wage growth,"" said Jimmy Jean, chief economist at Desjardins Group. 
Employment growth continues to outpace population growth, leading to tighter labor markets, Statscan said. Since September 2021, Canada has added 463,000 jobs, but just 236,000 new working age people.
Job gains were entirely in full-time work, partially offset with a slight decline in part-time work. Employment rose in both the services sector and the goods sector, led by accommodation and food services and construction.
Canada's employment rate, a ratio that accounts for population growth and not just net job gains, hit its pre-pandemic level for the first time in March. 
By comparison, the employment rate in the United States is still 1.1 percentage points below its February 2020 level, Statscan said.
Economists said the jobs data continues to support the Bank of Canada raising its policy rate by a half point to 1% when it meets next week.
""Today's figures may not be as dramatically strong as the prior month, but they are still solid enough to support calls for a 50 basis point hike,"" said Andrew Grantham, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets.

A record number of Canadian businesses say intense labor shortages and ongoing supply chain issues are hurting their ability to expand capacity to meet booming demand, according to a central bank survey this week.
The Canadian dollar steadied at 1.2588 to the greenback, or 79.44 U.S. cents after the jobs data, nearly unchanged on the day.

PARIS (Reuters) -World food prices jumped nearly 13% in March to a new record high as the war in Ukraine caused turmoil in markets for staple grains and edible oils, the U.N. food agency said on Friday.
The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 159.3 points last month versus an upwardly revised 141.4 for February.
The February figure was previously put at 140.7, which was a record at the time.
Russia and Ukraine are major exporters of wheat, corn, barley and sunflower oil via the Black Sea, and Moscow's six-week-old invasion of its neighbour has stalled Ukrainian exports.
The FAO last month said food and feed prices could rise by up to 20% as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, raising the risk of increased malnutrition.
The agency's cereal price index climbed 17% in March to a record level while its vegetable oil index surged 23%, also registering its highest reading yet, FAO said.
Disruption to supplies of crops from the Black Sea region has exacerbated price rises in food commodities, which were already running at 10-year highs in the FAO's index before the war in Ukraine due to global harvest issues.
Sugar and dairy prices also rose sharply last month, the FAO said.
In separate cereal supply and demand estimates on Friday, the FAO cut its projection of world wheat production in 2022 to 784 million tonnes, from 790 million last month, as it factored in the possibility that at least 20% of Ukraine's winter crop area would not be harvested.
The revised global wheat output estimate was nonetheless 1% above the previous year's level, it said.
The agency lowered its projection of global cereals trade in the 2021/22 marketing year as increased exports from Argentina, India, the European Union and the United States were expected to only offset some of the disruption to Black Sea exports.

Total cereal trade in 2021/22 was revised down by 14.6 million tonnes from the previous monthly outlook to 469 million tonnes, now 2% below the 2020/21 level.
Projected world cereal stocks at the end of 2021/22 were revised up by 15 million tonnes to nearly 851 million tonnes, mainly because of expectations that export disruption will lead to bigger stockpiles in Ukraine and Russia, the FAO added.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's consumer prices rocketed 1.9% in March, the highest monthly rise in almost thirty years, underscoring the challenge for authorities as they battle spiraling inflation exacerbated by rising global commodities costs. 
The Andean country's official statistics agency said on Friday that the rise had been driven by food prices, non-alcoholic beverages and education.
The monthly figure was far higher than the 1.05% rise expected in a Reuters poll of economists and is the highest monthly inflation rate since 1993. The rolling 12-month rate rose further to around 9.4%, the highest since 2008.
That remains far above the central bank's target rate of 2% to 4%, which has been driving a recent spate of interest rate hikes and may prompt more tightening ahead.
Governments around Latin America have been looking to combat inflation, which has been pushed higher by supply bottlenecks linked to the war in Ukraine. Brazil posted its highest monthly inflation in 28 years on Friday.
In Peru, facing its fastest inflation in a quarter of a century, rising prices are spurring angry protests that have rattled the government of leftist Pedro Castillo.
Chilean president Gabriel Boric announced a $3.7 billion economic recovery plan on Thursday that included a minimum wage hike to help people deal with rising prices.
The world's no. 1 copper producing country has seen a rapid economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic aided by state spending and withdrawals from private retirement funds, which has in turn caused strong inflationary pressure.
To combat inflation, the central bank raised the interest rate by 150 basis points to 7% in March.

""We think there may be a little room for the unemployment rate to fall further, given that some areas of the country - oil-producing provinces for example - were clearly not at full employment before the pandemic struck.""
""Today's figures may not be as dramatically strong as the prior month, but they are still solid enough to support calls for a 50 basis point hike from the Bank of Canada next week.""
ROYCE MENDES, DIRECTOR & HEAD OF MACRO STRATEGY AT DESJARDINS 
""The solid pace of hiring reinforces our view that the Bank of Canada will act forcefully next week to quell inflationary pressures by both hiking rates 50 basis points and initiating its quantitative tightening program. Bond yields are pushing higher in the wake of the release as traders firm up bets on aggressive action from the central bank.""
JIMMY JEAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT DESJARDINS GROUP
""We have 93,000 jobs created in the full time. So that's more than double what was expected. And remember, we are coming off a very strong month of February, we had 122,000 jobs created. So to follow up with another 93,000 jobs full time, that shows how just robust this market is. You have a two-tick decline in the unemployment rate 5.3%... We're beyond full employment. We're seeing the marking heating up, and that shows with the wage growth of 3.7%. That's a four-tick acceleration there. So those details coming in are very robust. From our perspective, it fully supports the view we have for next week for the Bank of Canada to go ahead with a 50-basis-point rate hike, and to announce the beginning of the asset purchase unwind, the cutting of the balance sheet.""
DEREK HOLT, VICE PRESIDENT OF CAPITAL MARKETS ECONOMICS, SCOTIABANK

""To keep the job creation machine going is a strong plus -tighter labour markets, lower unemployment. The one fly in the ointment is wages. Month-over-month, seasonally adjusted annualized they dipped. So we've had a couple months of slightly softening wage growth but not a huge deal yet.""
""On balance I don't think it is going to change anything for the Bank of Canada. I still expect (a hike of) 50 basis points next week.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's inflation came above expectations with the sharpest rise for March in 28 years, official figures showed on Friday, as higher fuel prices weighed on the economy, affected by an oil shock in the wake of the Ukraine conflict.
The IPCA consumer price index rose 1.62% from February, government statistics agency IBGE said, above a 1.3% gain seen in a Reuters poll of economists and accelerating from the February 1.01% figure.
This was the steepest rise for the month since 1994, before the creation of the real currency, underscoring strong inflationary pressures in Latin America's largest economy.
In the 12 months through March, inflation grew 11.30%, up from 10.54% in the prior month and well above the central bank's year-end target of 3.5%.
According to the IBGE, eight of the nine groups of products and services surveyed rose in March, with emphasis on transport, up 3.02% over the previous month, and food and beverages, which grew 2.42%.
The two groups alone contributed with almost three quarters of the month's inflation, IBGE added.
It also pointed out that the result in transport was affected by the 6.7% rise in fuel prices. Gasoline, in particular, was up 6.95%.
In mid-March, the state-run oil firm Petrobras announced a big increase in fuels to track global markets after Russia's invasion of Ukraine prompted oil prices to skyrocket.

Brazil's central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto said inflation would peak in April.
To tame the persistent rise in consumer prices, policymakers have put the country's benchmark interest at 11.75% from a record-low of 2% last March, signaling another 100 basis-point hike in May. That could wrap up the aggressive tightening cycle, which may be a big hurdle for economic growth this year.

Exports last month jumped 21.3% from a year earlier to $43.5 billion, the Ministry of Finance said on Friday, the highest monthly figure on record.
A Reuters poll of analysts had forecast a 21% rise for the month, compared with a 34.8% leap in February.
The ministry attributed the March growth to strong demand for electronic components as well as semiconductors, and companies increasing orders to ensure supplies to customers.
Exports of electronics components rose 35.6% in March to $18.24 billion, also a monthly record, with semiconductor exports surging 38.2% from a year earlier.
Many companies expect global chip shortages to last at least for the rest of the year, which will continue to fill Taiwanese semiconductor firms' order books.
Firms such as TSMC, the world's largest contract chip-maker, are major suppliers to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other global tech giants, as well as providers of chips for auto companies and lower-end consumer electronics.
Earlier on Friday, TSMC reported March sales of T$171.97 billion ($5.95 billion), up 33.2% from the same period last year.
The finance ministry said ""enormous"" demand for chips would continue to drive exports, but warned of uncertainty over the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing war in Ukraine, supply chain bottlenecks and inflation. 
Ministry official Beatrice Tsai said the second quarter would likely continue to see double-digit growth, but that it was ""hard to see"" rapid growth continuing in the second half. 
March exports to China, Taiwan's largest trading partner, grew an annual 13.4% to $18.03 billion, compared with a 39.9% on-year rise in February, while exports to the United States jumped 36.6%, slightly slower than the 40.3% rise recorded the previous month.
Imports leapt 20.3%, in line with economists' expectations of a 20.5% rise, after an increase of 35.3% in February.

Taiwan could see April exports increase in the range of 13% to 17% from a year earlier, the finance ministry said.

Soaring fuel costs and a weak yen have expanded Japan's trade deficit in recent months, more than offsetting heavy returns on investment and pushing the country's current account balance into the red.
The world's third-largest economy ran a current account surplus of 1.6483 trillion yen ($13.28 billion) in February, finance ministry data showed on Friday, against a median market forecast for a 1.4368 trillion yen surplus.
That followed a 1.1887 trillion yen deficit in January, the second biggest shortfall under comparable data dating back to 1985.
The trade deficit narrowed to 176.8 billion yen in February from 1.6043 trillion yen in January.
The primary income surplus, meanwhile, widened to 2.2745 trillion yen from 1.2813 trillion yen, although that was smaller than in the same month last year due to shrinking foreign investment returns, the data showed.
The smaller trade gap and larger primary income surplus helped push the current account back into positive territory.

Japan is particularly vulnerable to soaring fuel and raw material costs, as it relies almost entirely on imports for energy, adding to uncertainties about its already fragile recovery from the pandemic.
Some analysts have warned that Japan's worsening terms of trade and current account balance, if they persist, could erode market trust in the country's ability to pay back debt and work to weaken the yen further.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week, indicating a further tightening of labor market conditions heading into the second quarter, which could contribute to keeping inflation elevated.
Part of the decline in claims back to a more than 53-year low touched in mid-March reflected a revision of the seasonal factors, the model that the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Labor Department switched to additive factors to seasonally adjust the initial and continued claims data from multiplicative factors, which economists had complained were less reliable because of the economic shock caused by the coronavirus crisis.
""Now that most of the large effects of the pandemic on the unemployment insurance series have lessened, the seasonal adjustment models are once again specified as multiplicative models,"" the Labor Department said in a statement on Thursday. ""Statistical tests show that the unemployment insurance series should, in normal times, be estimated multiplicatively.""Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 166,000 for the week ended April 2. Claims were at this level during the week ending March 19, which was the lowest since November 1968. 
Seasonal factors back then were much different from now, making it difficult to make comparisons. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 200,000 applications for the latest week.
The government also revised claims data from 2017 through 2021, which showed the level of filings much lower last year. The switch back to multiplicative factors pushed applications down by about 20,000-40,000 for the recent weeks. Claims hit a record high of 6.137 million in early April 2020.
The government said it would use a hybrid of multiplicative and additive seasonal factors while the pandemic remains within the five-year revision period. Multiplicative seasonal factors are assumed to be proportional to the level of filings while additive factors are not affected.
""The message from these volatile and revision-prone data continues to be that the labor market is very tight by most historical standards,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
A severe shortage of workers is keeping layoffs low and boosting hiring. Worker demand is being driven by a sharp decline in COVID-19 infections, which has resulted in restrictions being lifted across the country. 
There were big declines in claims in Michigan and Texas, which offset increases in California, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. Prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasuries fell.
NEAR RECORD JOB OPENINGS
There is no sign yet that the Russia-Ukraine war, which has pushed gasoline prices above $4 per gallon, has impacted the labor market. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 431,000 jobs in March, the government reported last Friday. 
March marked the 11th straight month of job gains in excess of 400,000, which pushed the unemployment rate to a fresh two-year low of 3.6%. The jobless rate is just one tenth of a percentage point above its pre-pandemic level.
With a near record 11.3 million job openings on the last day of February, the scarcity of workers is forcing companies to boost wages, which is contributing to high inflation. 
While the claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 17,000 to 1.523 million during the week ended March 26, the trend in the so-called continuing claims remained low. 
""This was just a modest move up from the revised reading for the week ended March 19 that currently stands as the low since the start of the pandemic,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Minutes of the Federal Reserve's March 15-16 meeting published on Wednesday showed policymakers observed that ""demand for labor continued to substantially exceed available supply across many parts of the economy,"" and ""that various indicators
pointed to a very tight labor market."" 
The U.S. central bank last month raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years. Wednesday's minutes appeared to set the stage for hefty rate increases down the road.
Job openings far outpace the number of unemployed, illustrating the hiring challenges companies are facing. There were 6.0 million officially unemployed people in March. 

The resulting strong wage growth is providing some cushion for consumers battered by soaring prices, with annual inflation rising at its fastest pace in 40 years.
""The job market is strong, giving consumers a break from inflation and geopolitical concerns,"" said Scott Murray, an economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. ""Open positions and fewer layoffs point to solid economic growth.

55,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 11:42AM ET</span>",,,,,,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexican consumer prices rose in March to levels not seen since early 2001, with economists saying the data suggests more interest rate hikes are likely, as the central bank underscored the balance of risks for inflation deteriorated again.
Consumer price inflation rose 7.45% in the year through March, way more than the central bank's target of 3%, with a one-percentage-point tolerance range above and below that, the government's INEGI statistics agency said on Thursday.
It was also above the median forecast of analysts surveyed by Reuters, who projected inflation would rise to 7.36% in March, versus 7.28% in February.
For its part, core inflation, which strips out some volatile food and energy items, increased 6.78% in the year through March, a level not hit since April 2001.
Minutes from the Bank of Mexico's latest monetary policy meeting, which were published on Thursday, said all five of the bank's board members stated that forecasts for headline and core inflation were revised upwards, while most members underscored that convergence to target has been delayed.
Banxico, as the Mexican central bank is known, said ""most members stated that the balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation over the forecast horizon has deteriorated again and remains biased to the upside.""
Among upside risks to inflation, most board members mentioned the persistence of core inflation at high levels, external inflationary pressures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in agricultural and livestock product prices and in energy prices due to the recent geopolitical conflict, and cost-related pressures.
Headline and core inflation have ""further to run in the near term as food and energy inflation edges higher. Broader price pressures will also remain strong, suggesting that Banxico's tightening cycle will go further than most analysts expect,"" said Nikhil Sanghani, Latin America economist at Capital Economics.
Banxico raised its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points last month, its seventh straight hike, citing tightening global monetary and financial conditions, and uncertainty and inflationary pressure linked to the war in Ukraine.
""Persistent inflation risks, alongside the more hawkish U.S. Fed, will put pressure on Banxico to continue tightening over the coming months,"" said Sanghani. 

He forecast another 50-basis-point rate hike at the bank's next monetary policy meeting scheduled for May 12 and at least a further 150 basis points of tightening in this cycle to 8.50%.
Consumer prices rose 0.99% in March, according to non-seasonally adjusted figures, while the core index rose 0.72% during the month, according to INEGI data.

House prices grew by 1.4% month-on-month in March, the biggest rise in six months, the ninth consecutive month of increases and following a 0.8% rise in February.
Compared with a year ago, house prices were 11.0% higher, Halifax said, slowing slightly from growth of 11.2% in February which had been the highest rate since 2007.
Halifax said the rise reflected too many buyers chasing too few homes coming to the market, but it warned a growing squeeze on household finances might dampen house price growth in the months ahead.

""Buyers are ... dealing with the prospect of higher interest rates and a higher cost of living. With affordability metrics already extremely stretched, these factors should lead to a slowdown in house price inflation over the next year,"" said Russell Galley, Halifax managing director.
Consumer price inflation hit a 30-year high of 6.2% in February and the government's budget watchdog two weeks ago forecast it would go close to 9% in late 2022, contributing to the biggest fall in living standards since at least the 1950s.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The proportion of Japanese households expecting prices to rise a year from now has hit a 14-year high, a central bank survey showed on Thursday, as inflationary pressures from rising raw material costs grew.
The quarterly survey also showed more households felt worse off than three months ago as prices of food and daily necessities rose, highlighting the pain global commodity inflation was inflicting on Japan's fragile economy.
Of households surveyed, 84.3% expect prices to rise a year from now, up from 78.8% three months ago and marking the highest percentage since June 2008, the Bank of Japan's survey showed.
The survey, conducted between Feb. 4 and March 2, also showed 82.1% of households expect prices to rise five years from now. That was up from 80.8% in the previous survey in January and the highest ratio since December 2019.
A diffusion index measuring households' livelihoods worsened to minus 36.9 in March from minus 34.2 in December, with many of those surveyed blaming the pinch from rising grocery prices.
Japan has not been immune from surging fuel and commodity prices with wholesale inflation hitting record highs. Analysts also expect consumer inflation to hit or even exceed the BOJ's 2% inflation target as early as this month.

Unlike central banks in other advanced economies that are hiking interest rates to dampen inflationary pressures, the BOJ has little room to manoeuvre as Japan's economy is still struggling to recover from a pandemic-induced slump.
The survey is among data the BOJ will likely analyse at this month's policy meeting to see whether rising raw materials and fuel costs have affected public perceptions of future price moves, and how that may impact consumer spending.

The South American country's price index, which rose 2.9% in February, is showing a slower increase since President Nicolas Maduro's government began easing foreign exchange controls to allow a wider circulation of hard currency, leading to more stable prices.
The accumulated increase of prices in the last 12 months reached 284.4% at the end of March, while inflation in the first quarter was 11.4%, according to Reuters calculations based on official data, showing rising prices are still among the main problems affecting many families in the country.
Venezuela experienced hyperinflation until last year. Minimum wage in the country is the equivalent of $30 per month.
Inflation was pushed up in March by higher prices of communication and education services, according to the data.

The inflation's deceleration trend could be reversed following the implementation this month of a tax to operations in hard currency, a move by Maduro to boost the government's income. 
Venezuela's Finance Observatory this week reported problems to implement the tax by stores and companies, adding that the measure is creating ground for higher prices.

The Caixin services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dived to 42.0 in March from 50.2 in February, dropping below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. The reading indicates the sharpest activity decline since the initial onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in February 2020.
The survey, which focuses more on small firms in coastal regions, tallied with an official survey, which also showed deterioration in the services sector.
Analysts say contact-intensive services sectors such as transportation, hotel and catering were hurt the most, clouding the outlook for a much anticipated rebound in consumption this year.
A sub-index for new business fell for a second consecutive month, and at the fastest pace since March 2020.
Firms' input prices rose in March after easing to a six-month low in February.
The virus outbreaks and softer demand reduced firms' appetite for additional staff, with the employment sub-index showing continued contraction in activity albeit at a slower pace.
While firms remained generally upbeat about output over the next year, optimism slipped to a 19-month low amid concerns over the pandemic and the economic fallout from the Ukraine war.

Investing.com – China’s services sector activity fell at the sharpest pace in two years in March 2022, a private sector survey showed on Wednesday, as the country’s latest COVID-19 outbreak led to restricted mobility and weighed on demand.
The Caixin services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was 42, compared with the 50.2 figure from the previous month. It fell below the 50-mark separating growth from contraction in what was the sharpest activity decline since February 2020, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The  Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) released earlier in the week was 48.1. The manufacturing PMI was 49.5 and the non-manufacturing PMI was 48.4.
Contact-intensive services sectors such as transportation, hotel, and catering were hurt the most, which clouded the outlook for a rebound in consumption in 2022, according to analysts. The latest COVID-19 outbreaks and decreasing demand reduced firms' appetite for additional staff, in turn leading to a fall in the employment sub-index.
Although firms remained generally upbeat about output over the next year, optimism was at a 19-month low amid concerns over COVID-19 and the economic impact of the war in Ukraine.

The Caixin China Services Purchasing Managers Index fell to 42 in March from 50.2 in February, the lowest level since the depths of the 2020 lockdown after the initial outbreak in Wuhan. The reading was below the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction and well below the 49.7 median estimate in a survey of economists. 
Spending over the just-ended Qingming festival break, a traditional Chinese holiday where people usually visit the tombs of their ancestors, point to weak data for April as well. Domestic tourism revenue over the three-day period plunged 31% from a year ago, while delivery of packages and cinema box office sales also declined. 
The Caixin index painted an even bleaker picture than China’s official non-manufacturing purchasing managers index, which fell to 48.4 from February’s 51.6. The official survey tracks larger companies and includes the construction sector, while the Caixin survey focuses more on smaller businesses.
“Both supply and demand in the services sector contracted sharply after the latest wave of Covid outbreaks started to take off in early March,” said Wang Zhe, a senior economist at Caixin Insight Group. “Businesses grew less optimistic,” he said, with the sub-index for planned future activity hitting a 19-month low in March. 
The gauge for new business dropped to the weakest level since March 2020 while the one for new export business fell to the lowest since October 2020, according to a statement from Caixin and S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) on Wednesday.
Lockdowns and other restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19 show spending is still well below pre-pandemic levels. Tourism revenue over the three-day national holiday that ended Tuesday was only about 39% of the level reached during the same period in 2019, data from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism showed. 
A total of 17.5 million visits to funeral and cemetery service organizations were logged during the break, down 74% from last year, according to data from the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Many people shifted to the internet to pay their respects to their ancestors, with the number of online worships nearly tripling to 21.6 million, the figures showed. 
As a result, the number of workers employed in related sectors during the period dropped 15% on year to 1.03 million, according to the ministry.
Separate data from the Ministry of Transport showed around 53.8 million trips were made by rail, road, waterways and air during the holiday, down 62.7% from a year ago and 9.8% from the same period in 2020.
The number of packages delivered by the postal industry likely fell 12.8% year-on-year to 690 million during the holiday, the State Post Bureau said in a statement. Box office sales totaled 122 million yuan ($19.2 million), about one-seventh of the 822 million yuan recorded in the comparable period last year, according to data provided by ticketing company Maoyan.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services industry activity picked up in March, boosted by the rollback of pandemic restrictions, but higher prices for fuel and other commodities because of Russia's war against Ukraine are creating uncertainty for many businesses.
The Institute for Supply Management's survey on Tuesday showed capacity constraints and inflation remained major challenges, though the labor crunch had eased. According to Anthony Nieves, chair of the ISM Services Business Survey Committee, the Russia-Ukraine war ""has impacted material costs, most notably fuel and chemical prices.""
""The services sector is entering the second quarter on strong footing, but two risks continue to cloud the near-term outlook,"" said Bernard Yaros, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The first is Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the second risk remains COVID-19."" 
The ISM said its non-manufacturing activity index rebounded to a reading of 58.3 last month from a one-year low of 56.5 in February, ending three straight monthly declines. It also signaled a shift in spending back to services from goods.
COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted across the country following a massive decline in infections, unleashing pent-up demand for services like airline travel and dining out. But COVID-19 cases are rising in Europe and China. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the non-manufacturing index would rise to 58.4. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. 
ISM services PMI: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gdpzyjjxavw/ism.png 
Prices for commodities like oil, wheat and fertilizer have surged since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.
Seventeen services industries reported growth, including educational services, arts, entertainment and recreation, as well as utilities, construction, wholesale trade and accommodation and food services. Only agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting reported a decline.
Businesses in the industry said that ""grain and fertilizer prices are near all-time highs, resulting in decreased purchasing."" In the construction sector there were complaints that ""pricing pressures are stronger than ever due to the Russia-Ukraine war, and energy costs are skyrocketing."" 
Businesses in the utilities industry reported they were ""still seeing raw material subcomponent shortages, transportation delays and price increases."" Similar views were shared by their counterparts in the wholesale trade sector who said inflation was worsening, but noted that ""overall sales and profitability continue to be strong.""
The ISM's measure of new orders received by services businesses rebounded to a reading of 60.1 from a 12-month low of 56.1 in February. 
Its services industry employment gauge jumped to 54.0 after dropping to a 1-1/2-year low of 48.5 February, which also was the first contraction in the sub-index since January 2021. 
The improvement in labor supply was confirmed by March's employment report on Friday, which showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 431,000 jobs last month.
Despite the increase in hiring, services industries made little headway in reducing the backlog of unfinished work. 
That meant services inflation pushed higher. The survey's measure of prices paid by services industries increased to a near record 83.8 from 83.1 in February, indicating that inflation could remain uncomfortably high and elicit an aggressive response from the Federal Reserve. 
The U.S. central bank last month raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years. On Tuesday, Fed Governor Lael Brainard told a conference at the Minneapolis Fed that ""I think we can all absolutely agree inflation is too high and bringing inflation down is of paramount importance.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
RECORD TRADE DEFICIT
Surging commodity prices because of the Russia-Ukraine war were evident in a separate report from the Commerce Department, which showed the U.S. trade deficit held at a record high of $89.2 billion in February as both exports and imports increased.
The report added to recent data that showed a moderation in consumer and business spending in suggesting the economy slowed considerably last quarter amid the high inflation triggered by shortages. Economists had forecast a $88.5 billion deficit. 
Trade balance: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/mopanbbeyva/tradebalance.png 
Exports of goods and services shot up 1.8% to a record $228.6 billion. They were boosted by a 1.8% jump in goods exports, which also hit an all-time high. Petroleum exports hit a record high of $20.3 billion amid soaring crude oil prices.
Exports of consumer goods rose $1.3 billion. But capital goods exports dropped amid a decline in civilian aircraft.
Exports to Ukraine hit a record high, likely reflecting shipments of military equipment. Exports of services increased $1.3 billion to $69.9 billion, lifted by a $1.2 billion rise in travel. 
Imports of goods and services jumped 1.3% to an all-time high of $317.8 billion. Imports of goods gained 0.6% to a record $266.2 billion. Imports of industrial supplies and materials were the highest since June 2011. They were fueled by a $1.9 billion surge in crude oil, which averaged $76.37 per barrel, the highest since November 2014.
Imports of both capital and consumer goods hit record highs. Imports of services rose $2.4 billion to $51.6 billion, reflecting increases in charges for the use of intellectual property, transport and travel.
The surge in imports is being fueled by businesses rebuilding inventories, the main driver of gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter.

""While much of the strength of imports appears to reflect inventory rebuilding, which would normally provide an offsetting boost to growth, the record-setting pace of restocking at the end of last year means that inventories also look set to be an additional drag in the first quarter,"" said Andrew Hunter, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.
Trade has subtracted from gross domestic product growth for six straight quarters. Growth estimates for the first quarter range from as low as a 0.4% annualized rate to as high as a 2.8% pace. The economy grew at a 6.9% pace in the fourth quarter.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada's exports rose 2.8% in February to a record high, driven mostly by energy products, while imports climbed 3.9% from the previous month, data from Statistics Canada showed on Tuesday, with economists anticipating more gains for exports ahead. 
The country's trade surplus with the world narrowed to C$2.66 billion ($2.14 billion), below analyst forecasts of C$2.9 billion. But exports came in above expectations at C$58.75 billion, with imports at C$56.08 billion.
Statscan also said border blockades in February by anti-vaccine mandate protesters had little impact on overall trade activity, with most road shipments rerouted.
""Canada's trade balance narrowed slightly in February as imports recovered from the previous month's weakness. However, the bigger story is the recent string of surpluses supported by strength in energy prices,"" Shelly Kaushik, an economist at BMO Economics, said in a note.
""Looking ahead, a further surge in commodity prices will continue to buoy exports in March."" 
Energy exports rose 7.8% to a record high, making up more than two-thirds of the total increase, while exports of non-energy products were up 1.2%. In volume terms, exports were up 0.6%. 
""Exports of crude oil contributed the most to the growth in February 2022, largely due to higher prices,"" Statscan said. 
Oil prices were climbing even before Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 and have since surged. Canada is the world's fourth-largest producer of oil.
The crisis also has pushed up imports, with Canada's imports of fertilizers, pesticides and other chemicals hitting a record high. Statscan pointed to lower production in China and quotas on fertilizer exports from Russia as contributing factors.
""These events create uncertainty about the availability and the cost of these products, resulting in atypical movements for Canadian fertilizer imports,"" it said.
With imports expected to drop back in March and commodity exports to benefit from rising prices, the surplus is likely to widen in coming months, analysts said.
""By our estimates, the terms of trade is now the most favorable on record and points to an improvement in the goods trade surplus to as high as C$6.0 billion,"" Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.

""It remains to be seen how much of that extra income will find its way into the rest of the economy,"" he added. 
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.6% higher at 1.2410 to the greenback, or 80.58 U.S. cents.

The Institute for Supply Management said on Tuesday its non-manufacturing activity index rebounded to a reading of 58.3 last month from a one-year low of 56.5 in February. That ended three straight months of declines in the index and also signaled a shift in spending back to services from goods.
COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted across the country following a massive decline in coronavirus infections, unleashing pent-up demand for services like airline travel and dining out. The government reported last week that consumer spending on services increased by the most in seven months in February, while goods outlays declined.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the non-manufacturing index rising to 58.4. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. 
The ISM's measure of new orders received by services businesses rebounded to a reading of 60.1 from a 12-month low of 56.1 in February. 
Its services industry employment gauge jumped to 54.0 after dropping to a 1-1/2-year low of 48.5 February, which also was the first contraction in the sub-index since January 2021. 
The strong demand for labor was confirmed by March's employment report on Friday, which showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 431,000 jobs last month.
Despite the increase in hiring, services industries made little headway in reducing the backlog of unfinished work, indicating that shortages remained binding. 
Russia's war against Ukraine is worsening global supply constraints. Prices for commodities like oil and wheat have surged since the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.
The ISM survey's measure of order backlogs at services businesses edged up to 64.5 last month after surging to 64.2 in February. Its gauge of supplier deliveries slipped to a still-high reading of 63.4 from 66.2 in February. A reading above 50 indicates slower deliveries. 

That meant services inflation pushed higher. The survey's measure of prices paid by services industries increased to 83.8 from 83.1 in February, indicating that inflation could remain uncomfortably high and elicit an aggressive response from the Federal Reserve. 
The U.S. central bank last month raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years. Policymakers have been ratcheting up their hawkish rhetoric, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying the U.S. central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to hike rates and possibly ""more aggressively"" to keep high inflation from becoming entrenched.

The February gap in goods and services trade was little changed at $89.2 billion after a record shortfall in January, Commerce Department data showed Tuesday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a $88.5 billion February shortfall. The figures aren’t adjusted for prices. 
The value of imports rose 1.3% in February to a record $317.8 billion and exports climbed 1.8% to $228.6 billion.
Services imports increased by $2.4 billion to a record $51.6 billion, with about half of the rise coming from the biggest monthly increase in charges for use of intellectual property since 2016. That probably reflects a temporary boost from rights fees to broadcast the winter Olympics, consistent with such spikes in previous years.
Meantime, goods imports also rose, reflecting an increase in industrial supplies such as crude oil and chemicals that more than offset a drop in automobiles.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth got a boost last month from the re-opening of economies following the Omicron coronavirus variant, according to a survey which however showed soaring energy costs and Russia's invasion of Ukraine threaten the recovery.
S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI)'s final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good guide to economic health, dipped to 54.9 in March from February's 55.5 but was ahead of a preliminary 54.5 estimate.
""March's final euro zone PMI surveys confirmed that output expectations fell sharply, with Germany experiencing the biggest drop. Meanwhile, price pressures remain intense across the currency union,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds at Capital Economics.
Germany's services sector grew at the fastest pace in six months in March after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted, but uncertainty after Russia's invasion and accelerating inflation clouded the outlook, earlier data showed.
France's services sector also grew at a faster rate last month, but the pace slowed in Italy and Spain as the war in Ukraine weighed on demand.
In Britain, outside the European Union, services companies enjoyed stronger growth last month than first estimated despite rampant inflation pressures. [GB/PMIS]
A PMI covering the euro zone's dominant services industry nudged up to 55.6 from 55.5, beating the 54.8 flash estimate.
But the rate of growth in overall demand fell and export orders, which include orders made between member nations, declined as firms jacked up their prices to compensate for a record increase in input costs.
Inflation in the currency union was a record high of 7.5% in March, official data showed last week, and with the services output prices PMI at 62.6 - the highest since the survey began in mid-1998 - it is likely to rise further.
That adds pressure on the European Central Bank to rein in runaway prices, even though growth is likely to slow sharply.

The intensifying cost of living crisis, alongside renewed supply chain bottlenecks following Russia's invasion, put a big dent in optimism. The composite future output index slumped to 59.1 from 68.9, its lowest since October 2020.
""The sharp declines in the future output PMIs tell us that firms think that the worst is yet to come,"" Allen-Reynolds said.

S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI)'s Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of activity in the services sector, which accounts for around half of Spain's economic output, fell to 53.4 from 56.6 in February. The index was still well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
While businesses were buoyed by the fading effects of the coronavirus pandemic, a truckers strike and uncertainty related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine weighed on activity.
""Firms reported that clients were more cautious and a little hesitant in their decision-making,"" S&P Global's economist Paul Smith said in a report.
Still, activity encouraged companies to hire more. ""Despite this relatively gloomy backdrop - which hurt general confidence - firms still faced capacity constraints, seeking to recruit additional staff wherever possible,"" he said.

The slowdown in the third month of the quarter is a bad sign after quarterly economic growth in the fourth quarter had slowed to 2.2% from 2.6% in the previous three months.
The Spanish government is due to update its growth target for this year from the current 7% after last year's post-pandemic recovery undershot its goal at 5.1%.

The S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) purchasing managers' index (PMI) slid to 38.1 in March from 52.1 the previous month, sliding well below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.
Inflationary pressure intensified in March. Firms in the services sector registered a series-record rise in output charges, and the rate of cost inflation also reached its highest since the survey began in October 2001.
The companies that took part in the monthly survey also reported a drop in domestic and foreign customer demand, while employment levels fell at their sharpest pace since June 2020.
""Reduced staffing numbers also reflected subdued business confidence, as expectations regarding the year-ahead outlook slumped to their lowest in two years,"" S&P Global said in the PMI report.
Output expectations across the Russian service sector fell as firms expected to see a decline in activity in the coming year, the survey showed.
""Pessimism reportedly stemmed from greater economic and geopolitical uncertainty,"" the PMI report said.

The survey did not mention Russia sending tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 or the wide-reaching economic sanctions imposed on Moscow after that.
A sister survey showed last week that Russian manufacturing activity also shrank in March at its fastest pace since the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020.

The headline seasonally adjusted S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the whole economy rose to 56.8 in March from 56.2 in February, exactly in line with the series average since August 2009.
""The Saudi Arabia PMI continued to signal strong growth in the non-oil economy in March, as new business and activity rose sharply in line with recovering client demand,"" wrote David Owen, economist at survey compiler S&P Global.
""Supply chains also displayed strength, with lead times shortening to the greatest extent for three years. In turn, companies raised their purchasing at the fastest rate since December 2017, supporting higher capacity levels.""
The output sub-index rose to 62.4 from 60.4 in February, above the series average of 61.4. New orders also rose and new export orders returned to growth after two months of contraction.
Sentiment regarding output over the next 12 months remained in growth territory, though less so than in February and below historical trends. About 14% of respondents expected higher output in the next year.
The employment sub-index dipped below the 50.0 mark into contraction territory for the first time in a year.
""Sector-level data indicated that reductions in staffing at construction and wholesale & retail firms contrasted with expansions in services and manufacturing,"" the PMI report said.

Cost pressures in the kingdom increased in March as already high commodity prices turned volatile following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Staff wages also increased, though marginally.
""Rising petrol and raw material prices greatly added to firms' expenses sheets. However, with sales also improving, businesses were able to increase their output prices accordingly - both costs and charges rose at the strongest rates since August 2020,"" Owen said.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's household spending rose for a second consecutive month year-on-year in February, helped by a flattering comparison with last year's sharp pandemic-induced slump but the consumer sector is now facing growing headwinds from soaring prices.
Households cut spending from the previous month as pandemic curbs, rapid food and fuel price rises and the coronavirus kept wallets shut, casting a shadow over the world's third-largest economy.
In a sign of trouble for consumer sentiment, real wage growth stagnated in February as global inflationary pressures weighed on household purchasing power.
""Prices will outpace wage gains from now on, so consumption will be on a sluggish trend,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""While service spending is expected to pick up from April onwards, the likelihood is big that higher prices will weigh on other areas of consumption,"" Minami said, adding that spending was likely to pick up nonetheless.
Household spending increased 1.1% in February from a year earlier, government data showed, much weaker than the market forecast of a 2.7% gain in a Reuters poll.
The month-on-month figures showed a sharp 2.8% decline, also weaker than a forecast 1.5% drop.
The data raises some concerns for policymakers looking for ways to offset the hit households are taking from soaring global inflation and a weakening yen, which is pushing up import costs, as the economy shakes off the pandemic's drag.
Households increased spending on mobile phones as well as car insurance and parts such as batteries on pent-up demand due to price hikes, a government official said.
But slower spending on eating out, including on sushi, weighed on expenditures, as authorities prolonged pandemic curbs in response to a wave of Omicron infections during the month.
A separate survey showed that Japan's services sector activity continued to shrink in March, though the pace of contraction slowed as domestic demand got a lift from the subsequent easing of the pandemic curbs last month.

Other government data on Tuesday showed inflation-adjusted real wages hit a standstill in February, as growth of consumer prices offset gains in nominal wage growth.
The economy is projected to grow in the current quarter following an expected contraction in the first three months of the year, though it is facing an unpredictable outlook in part due to the Ukraine situation and the weak yen.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods fell in February, likely because of persistent shortages of materials and a shift in spending back to services, but manufacturing remains supported by low inventories at businesses.
The Commerce Department said on Monday that factory orders fell 0.5% in February. Data for January was revised slightly higher to show orders rising 1.5% instead of 1.4% as previously reported. February's decrease in factory orders was in line with economists' expectations.
Manufacturing accounts for 12% of the U.S. economy. An Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey last Friday showed its index of national factory activity declined in March to the lowest level since September 2020, with factories reporting no let-up in supply chain challenges.
The global supply crunch has been worsened by Russia's war against Ukraine, which has sent prices for commodities like oil and wheat soaring. Though demand is reverting back to services, business inventories remain lean, which should keep factories humming. Government data last week showed that consumer spending on services increased by the most in seven months in February.
The decline in factory orders in February was led by a 5.3% tumble in transportation equipment. Orders for motor vehicles and parts fell 0.6%, likely reflecting an ongoing global semiconductor shortage, which has hampered production. 
There were also sharp decreases in orders for machinery as well as computers and electronic products. But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components rose 0.6%. Orders for furniture and related products rebounded 2.7%. 
Shipments of manufactured goods rose 0.6% after advancing 1.4% in January. Inventories at factories climbed 0.6%. Unfilled orders gained 0.4% after increasing 0.9% in the prior month.

The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, slipped 0.2% instead of 0.3% as previously reported last month.
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, rose 0.3% in February instead of the previously reported 0.5%.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Turkey's annual consumer inflation leapt to a 20-year high of 61.14% in March, data showed on Monday, fuelled by rising energy and commodity prices as the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine conflict compounds the impact of the lira's plunge last year.
Inflation has surged since last autumn, when the lira slumped after the central bank (CBRT) launched a 500 basis-point easing cycle sought by President Tayyip Erdogan.
Month-on-month consumer prices rose 5.46%, the Statistical Institute said, just below a Reuters poll forecast of 5.7%. The annual consumer price inflation forecast was 61.5%.
""CBRT policies are just not working in countering inflation,"" said Tim Ash at BlueBay Asset Management. ""Indeed, I think the overwhelming consensus is that the unorthodox policy settings of the CBRT are a major cause of inflation.
""The war in Ukraine is just making things that much worse,"" Ash added, nothing the bank had not hit its annual inflation target of 5% since 2011.
The data had little impact on the lira, which weakened 0.15% to 14.715 against the dollar. The local currency tumbled 44% in 2021 and another 10% this year.
TRADE DEFICIT BALLOONS
The government has said inflation will fall to single digits next year under its new economic programme - prioritising low interest rates to boost production and exports - aimed a achieving a current account surplus.
However, data on Monday showed the trade deficit widened 77% year-on-year in March to $8.24 billion, with a 156% increase in the value of energy imports, threatening to derail the current account goal.
Haluk Burumcekci, founder of Burumcekci Consulting, said inflation could peak at 70%-75% even if the lira does not weaken from its current level, only falling with the base effect in the last months of the year.
""It will not at all be easy for the CBRT to maintain its loose monetary policy stance,"" he said.
Consumer price inflation was driven by transportation, including petrol prices, and education prices, which rose 13.29% and 6.55% respectively. Rising energy prices have drawn public protests in recent months.
Annually, transportation prices rose 99.12% and food and non-alcoholic drink prices were up 70.33%.
Economists marked up inflation expectations globally following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with energy prices hitting multi-year highs as the West sanctioned Moscow. Turkey imports almost all of its energy needs.

The Reuters poll forecast year-end inflation of 52.2%, up from 38% in last month's poll.
Producer prices climbed 9.19% in March, or 114.97% annually.

(Reuters) - Spain's labour market withstood soaring inflation and a crippling truckers' strike in March to see a drop in unemployment, data showed on Monday, helped in part by reforms aimed at cutting the use of temporary contracts.
The number of people registering as jobless in Spain slipped 0.09% in March from February, or by 2,921 people, leaving 3.11 million people out of work, Labour Ministry data showed.
Spain added 23,998 net jobs during the month, a 0.12% rise from February.
The number of people enrolled in social security programmes in seasonally adjusted terms hit 19.96 million, the highest in the historical series, after eleven months of consecutive growth, the Social Security Ministry said in a separate report.
Spain has long had high unemployment, largely due to the ease with which employers can fire staff in a market in which almost a quarter of jobs are held under temporary contracts. February's 12.6% unemployment rate was still the European Union's highest, according to Eurostat.
The government passed a labour reform in December as part of commitments to receive EU recovery funds that limits the legal use of temporary contracts and promotes employment protection schemes such as furloughs to avoid permanent layoffs.
In March, 1.7 million new job contracts were signed in Spain, of which a third were permanent, an increase of 148% over March 2021, according to Labour Ministry data.
""Despite the difficult times in which we find ourselves, unemployment in March has fallen by 2,921 people and we reached the highest number of permanent contracts in the historical series,"" tweeted Labour Minister Yolanda Diaz.

""Since December, the percentage of permanent contracts as a percentage of total contracts has tripled.""
Consumer prices spiked 9.8% in March in Spain, pushed up by energy and fresh food, after the country suffered two weeks of transport workers' strikes that brought factories to a halt and emptied supermarket shelves.

A current conditions index fell to -5.5 from 7.8, its lowest level since April last year, while an expectations index fell to -29.8 from -20.8, its lowest level since December 2011.
While the dip in March's morale had been expected due to the start of the war in Ukraine, the strong fall in sentiment in April once again puts investors on the back foot, said Sentix. 
The conflict and related sanctions and uncertainties are pushing the euro zone economy towards a recession, it added.
""Investors do not expect that the central bank can rush to the rescue with a more relaxed, more expansive monetary policy because of the still considerable pace of inflation growth.""
Sentix said morale was dropping globally although nowhere as sharply as in the euro zone.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - India's factory activity expanded at a slower pace in March as rising prices meant new orders and output grew at their weakest rate since September, according to a survey released on Monday that also showed optimism at a two-year low. 
The survey provides the latest evidence the recovery in Asia's third-largest economy is slowing. Hikes in oil prices, primarily driven by uncertainties around the Russia-Ukraine war, have already taken a toll on consumer spending - the biggest contributor to GDP growth. 
Compiled by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index declined to 54.0 in March from 54.9 in February. However, it has remained above the 50-level separating growth from contraction for nine straight months. 
Despite that decline, the sector had its best annual fiscal year performance since FY 2011/12. 
""Manufacturing sector growth in India weakened at the end of fiscal year 2021/22, with companies reporting softer expansions in new orders and production,"" noted Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at S&P Global. 
""The slowdown was accompanied by an intensification of inflationary pressures, although the rate of increase in input costs remained below those seen towards the end of 2021."" 
Sub-indexes tracking new orders and output were at six-month lows and foreign demand contracted for the first time since June 2021, highlighting a weakening global economic recovery and a slowdown in China. 
But factories increased headcount for the first time in four months. 
Still, rising cost pressures remained one of the main concerns as firms faced a faster increase in input prices last month, forcing them to transfer some of that burden to consumers. Output prices rose at the quickest rate in five months. 

""For now, demand has been sufficiently strong to withstand price hikes, but should inflation continue to gather pace we may see a more significant slowdown, if not an outright contraction in sales,"" added De Lima. ""Companies themselves appeared very concerned about price pressures, which was a key factor dragging down business confidence to a two-year low."" 
Like other major economies, India is experiencing a persistent surge in inflation due to elevated supply disruptions and a jump in oil prices - the biggest component of the country's imports.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil posted a record trade surplus for March, of $7.4 billion, official data showed on Friday, but the number was well below market forecasts amid expectations that exports would rise as commodity prices spike. 
Economists projected a $9.01 billion surplus for the month, according to a Reuters poll. 
Exports were up 25% over March last year to $29.1 billion, a record for any given month. But imports rose further, by 27.1%, to $21.7 billion, the Economy Ministry reported.
In both cases, rising prices guided the results.
While the volume of imported products dropped 7.1% compared with the same month last year, prices gained 29.5%. The volume of exported goods increased 1.8%, while prices grew 17.2% in March.
In the first quarter, Brazil's trade surplus was $11.3 billion, up from $8.1 billion in the same period last year.
For 2022, the Economy Ministry updated its forecast to a trade surplus of $111.6 billion, much higher than the $79.4 billion estimated before, on the back of a surge in goods sold abroad
The outlook for exports was revised up to $348.8 billion in 2022, compared with a January projection of $284.3 billion. 
""The conflict between Russia and Ukraine led to higher prices and generates expectations of higher exported value,"" said the under secretary for foreign trade intelligence and statistics, Herlon Brandao.

Brazil is a major exporter of soybeans, iron ore, pulp, sugar, beef and crude petroleum.
The ministry estimated that imports will total $237.2 billion this year, up from $204.9 billion seen previously.

(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic's grip on the U.S. job market notably loosened in March, two years after a state of emergency was declared, as the number of people homebound by COVID-19 concerns hit a new low and fewer people reported having to work remotely. 
In all, the government's benchmark monthly nonfarm payrolls report out Friday showed that by several metrics - including the total number of unemployed dropping below 6 million and a 3.6% unemployment rate - the U.S. job market had all but recovered from the devastating hit delivered in the first two months of the pandemic when 22 million people were thrown out of work.
The main report and a supplemental survey illustrated the pandemic's rapidly waning restraint and dovetailed with recent health data showing the fewest new infections since July and hospitalizations over the last week averaging the lowest since the initial surge in March and April 2020.
""There are still challenges,"" Labor Secretary Marty Walsh said in an interview. But ""you can almost feel the mood of the country changing.""

A litany of data points painted an employment picture redolent of February 2020, then heralded as one of the strongest job markets of the post-World War Two era. Among them:
* The workforce participation rate of women aged 25-54, which has experienced an uneven recovery, jumped by the most since June 2020, seven-tenths of a percentage point. Now at 76.5%, it is just four-tenths of a point from where it was before the pandemic.
* The broadest measure of unemployment also capturing those marginally attached to the workforce or working part time for economic reasons fell to 6.9%, below February 2020's level and a fraction from a record low.
* Overall employment climbed to just 1% below its pre-pandemic level, but minority groups have more than fully recovered: Total employment among Blacks, Hispanics and Asians now surpasses February 2020 levels.

The report also showed the disease itself having its smallest impact on worker behavior since the pandemic began.
Just 874,000 people were reported to have not sought work in the previous four weeks because of COVID-19, down from 1.23 million in February and 1.81 million in January when the Omicron variant drove U.S. infections to a record. 
In May 2020 - the first month the Bureau of Labor Statistics launched its supplemental survey on the pandemic's effects on the job market - some 9.7 million people had not looked for work because of the coronavirus outbreak.
""People feel more comfortable going back to work,"" Walsh said. ""More people (are) shopping. Hospitality and leisure are really benefiting.""

And just 10% of those people with a job said they either teleworked or worked from home because of COVID-19, a figure representing about 15.8 million workers. That is also a pandemic-era low and is roughly a third of the number reporting the need to work remotely in May 2020. 
""I don’t know what the new normal will be, but it is a good sign to get more people into the workforce,"" Walsh said. The challenge in coming months is that ""we are going to start running out of people,"" a fact he said should make efforts to increase immigration a priority.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employers maintained a brisk pace of hiring in March, driving the unemployment rate to a new two-year low of 3.6% while also boosting wages, resulting in a further tightening of labor market conditions and opening the door to a hefty 50 basis points interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve in May.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed more people joining the workforce, likely attracted by the higher wages. Employment in professional and business services, financial activities and retail sectors is now above pre-pandemic levels. 
The 11th straight month of job gains in excess of 400,000 underscored the economy's resilience even as growth appears to have slowed considerably in the first quarter under the weight of high inflation amid snarled supply chains.
""Despite concerns about inflation and the Russia-Ukraine war, American businesses are still hiring at full throttle, while more people are returning to the labor force,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
""That's great news for the economy. However, the labor market is only getting tighter and wages are on a clear upward track, fanning the inflation flames. The Fed has every reason to go big or go home on May 4.""
The survey of establishments showed that nonfarm payrolls increased by 431,000 jobs last month. The economy created 95,000 more jobs in January and February than initially estimated. 
Nonfarm payrolls https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/movanbdwmpa/nfpr.png
Overall employment is now 1.6 million jobs below its pre-pandemic level, with many economists predicting all the jobs lost will be recouped by July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing 490,000 in March. Estimates ranged from as low as 200,000 to as high as 700,000.
Worker demand is being driven by a sharp decline in COVID-19 infections, which has resulted in restrictions being lifted across the country. There is no sign yet that the Russia-Ukraine war, which has pushed gasoline prices above $4 per gallon, has impacted the labor market.
President Joe Biden welcomed the upbeat report saying more people working could help to ease the pressure on supply chains.
""That's good news for fighting inflation,"" Biden said. ""It is good news for our economy, and it means that our economy has gone from being on the mend to being on the move."" 
The broad increase in payrolls was led by the leisure and hospitality industry, which added 112,000 jobs. Professional and business services payrolls increased by 102,000 jobs, hoisting employment in the sector 723,000 above its pre-pandemic level.
Retailers added 49,000, pushing the level of employment 278,000 higher than in February 2020.
Jobs by industry Jobs by industry https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/INDUSTRY/qmypmdoolvr/chart.png
Financial activities employment grew by 16,000 and is now 41,000 above its pre-pandemic level. Manufacturing payrolls increased by 38,000 jobs and is yet to recoup all the jobs lost during the pandemic. Construction employment is now back at its pre-pandemic level, with 19,000 jobs added in March.
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose, with the closely watched yield curve between two-year and 10-year notes inverting for the third time this week amid concerns that tight monetary policy could tip the economy into recession.
The Fed last month raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years. Policymakers have been ratcheting up their hawkish rhetoric, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying the U.S. central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to hike rates and possibly ""more aggressively"" to keep high inflation from becoming entrenched.
RECORD JOB OPENINGS
With a near record 11.3 million job openings on the last day of February, payrolls growth could remain strong this year.
Job gains averaged 562,000 per month in the first quarter. But inflation is eating into growth, with gross domestic product estimates for the January-March quarter mostly below a 1.0% annualized rate, a sharp slowdown from the fourth quarter's brisk 6.9% pace.
Annual inflation rose in February by the most in 40 years. Despite the anxiety in the bond market, economists expect the expansion to continue. 
Many viewed the Fed's massive holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities as distorting the yield curve moves.
Some noted that real yields remained negative, while others argued that the two-year/five-year Treasury yield curve was a better indicator of a future recession. This segment has not inverted.
""The amazingly strong job gains this year point to a solid economy,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""What we are likely seeing is a deceleration back toward more normal levels of growth after having posted clearly unsustainable robust numbers.""  
The labor pool continued to steadily expand in March.
The household survey, from which the unemployment rate is derived, showed 418,000 entered the labor force last month. About 249,000 women, 20 years of age and older, joined the workforce. That was more than offset by a 736,000 surge in household employment. 
As result, the unemployment rate dropped two-tenths of a percentage point to 3.6%, the lowest since February 2020.
Unemployment declined for all race groups, with a large decline among Blacks. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, rose to a two-year high of 62.4% from 62.3% in February. The participation rate for the prime age group also rose to a two-year high of 82.5% from 82.2% in February.

According to a report from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas on Thursday, the skyrocketing cost of living was ""causing workers who were depending on savings or investments to seek out paid employment.""

There was a significant reduction in those experiencing long spells of unemployment as well as those being unable to work because of the pandemic. 
With workers still scarce, average hourly earnings increased 0.4% after edging up 0.1% in February. That lifted the annual increase to 5.6% from 5.2% in February. But the workweek shortened to 34.6 hours from 34.7 hours in February.

The seasonally adjusted S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 49.2 in March, from 48.0 in February, below the 50 threshold that separates growth from contraction.
The upward movement in the PMI reflected slower reductions in new orders, stocks of purchases and employment, as well as a sharper deterioration in supplier performance, the survey said.
The index has remained below the 50-mark since March 2020, and plummeted to 35.0 in April 2020 during the initial lockdown phase of the coronavirus pandemic, in what was by far the lowest reading in the survey's 11 year history.
""With Mexico's manufacturing industry stuck in contraction and inflationary pressures mounting, the latest results ring alarm bells for policymakers,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at S&P Global.
Companies polled in the survey reported a fall in production volumes and input costs rose sharply.
""PMI data showed the second-sharpest increase in input costs in the 11-year survey history, which companies often linked to raw material scarcity, the pandemic and Russia's war against Ukraine,"" said De Lima.

Those surveyed remained optimistic about future output, even as overall confidence was dampened by inflation concerns, raw material scarcity and the war.
The combination of ongoing interest rate hikes and acute price pressures is likely to curtail business investment and consumption, making it more difficult for the economy to recover, De Lima said.

The Andean country's consumer prices rose 1.48% last month, the highest since the 1.53% seen in February 1996, according to historical data provided by the Peruvian central bank.
In the first quarter of 2022, consumer prices in the Lima metropolitan region - which are seen as the national benchmark - stood at 1.84%, the government's statistics agency said.

The National Institute of Statistics and Information also said that Peru's inflation in the past 12 months now stands at 6.82%, well above the central bank's annual target of 1% to 3%.
In 2021, the South American country - the world's No. 2 copper producer - posted an annual inflation of 6.43%, the highest rate in 13 years.

88,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 10:11AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity unexpectedly slowed in March as tight supply chains continued to drive input prices higher, but factories boosted hiring, allowing them to reduce the backlog of unfinished work.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Friday that its index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 57.1 last month from 58.6 in February. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 59.0.
The slowdown in manufacturing also reflects a shift in spending back to services amid a significant decline in COVID-19 infections, which has resulted in the rolling back of restrictions across the country. Government data on Thursday showed consumer spending on services increasing by the most in seven months in February, while goods outlays declined.
The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index fell to 53.8 last month from 61.7 in February. Goods spending surged as the pandemic curbed demand for services like travel. Even as spending reverts back to services, manufacturing should remain underpinned by very low inventories. Customer inventories have remained extremely lean for more than 60 months. 
Russia's war against Ukraine, which has boosted prices of oil, wheat and other commodities, likely slowed the improvement in the global supply chains. 
The ISM survey's measure of supplier deliveries dipped to a still-high reading of 65.4 from 66.1 in February. A reading above 50% indicates slower deliveries to factories. 
That kept inflation at the factory gate very hot. The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers increased to a reading of 87.1 from 75.6 in February. 

The Federal Reserve last month raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years, and adopted a hawkish posture as it fights inflation.
The survey's measure of factory employment increased to a reading of 56.3 in March from 52.9 in February. With more workers on the floor, a gauge of unfinished work at factories fell to 60.0 from a reading of 65.0 in February.

The S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 58.9 in March from 56.6 in February, posting its highest level in the 11-year history of the survey. A reading above 50 shows growth in the sector.
""Canada's manufacturing sector again enjoyed a bustling month of trading in March,"" Shreeya Patel, an economist at S&P Global said in a statement. ""Key to growth were robust uplifts in output, new orders and purchases.""
The output index rose to its highest level since March last year and the measure of new orders climbed as well.
Higher sales were attributed by manufacturers in part to the relaxation of pandemic restrictions, S&P Global said. Ontario, Canada's most populous province, dropped its mask mandate in most locations last week.
Still, concerns over input shortages and delivery delays led to record levels of stockpiling, while the input price index jumped to a survey-record high of 78.6 from 70.1.

""With demand showing no signs of letting up and the knock-on effects of the war in Ukraine, we can expect to see prices rising at elevated rates for at least the duration of the year,"" Patel said.
Western sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine have disrupted oil supplies, driving prices higher. Moscow calls its Ukraine action a ""special military operation"".

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation surged to 7.5% in March, hitting another record high with months still left before it is set to peak, raising pressure on the European Central Bank to rein in runaway prices even as growth slows sharply. 
Consumer price growth in the 19 countries sharing the euro accelerated from 5.9% in February, Eurostat said on Friday, far beyond the 6.6% expected, as war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia pushed fuel and natural gas prices to record highs. 
Although energy was the chief culprit, inflation in food prices, services and durable goods all came in above the ECB's 2% target, further proof that price growth is increasingly broad and not merely a reflection of expensive oil. 
With the ECB having persistently underestimated inflation over the past year, the figure will come as a shock to policymakers, some of whom are already calling for tighter policy to avoid high price growth becoming entrenched. 
""The inflation data speak for themselves,"" Joachim Nagel, president of the German Bundesbank, said on Friday. ""Monetary policy should not pass up the opportunity for timely countermeasures.""
The central bank governors of Austria and the Netherlands have already called for rate hikes this year, worried that rapid price growth is becoming broad-based, an argument supported by underlying data from Friday's release.
Inflation excluding volatile food and fuel prices, closely watched by the ECB, picked up to 3.2% from 2.9% while a narrower measure that also excludes alcohol and tobacco products jumped to 3.0% from 2.7%.
Any cut in Russian gas supplies would also quickly feed through to customers, boosting prices even as governments are putting in place subsidy measures to offset some of the cost. 
ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane acknowledged that inflation is very high but said there were opposing forces at work and the euro zone central bank should take its time analysing the data.
""We have the energy shock, the prospects of second-round effects, pushing up inflation,"" Lane told CNBC
""On the other hand, the weakening of sentiment, the fact that real incomes will suffer with the high energy prices, especially over a one- to two-year horizon, will have a negative pressure on the inflation outlook."" 
INFLATION SOARS, GROWTH STAGNATES 
All this leaves the ECB with a difficult policy dilemma.
Its main task is to get inflation to 2% but tightening policy now would risk crashing an economy that is already reeling from the fallout of the war in its neighbour and the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The ECB estimates that growth in the first quarter was positive, but barely, while second-quarter growth will be near-zero, as high energy prices dent consumption and hurt corporate investment. 
High energy prices are traditionally a drag on growth and will thus actually weigh on inflation once the immediate spike passes, raising the risk that price growth will later fall back below target. 
But the ECB can hardly ignore high inflation, especially since it says the peak is still three to four months away.
The euro zone's labour market is the tightest it has been in decades so wage inflation, a precondition of durable consumer inflation, is already in the pipeline. And ECB inaction would also boost inflation expectations, likely making price growth more permanent. 
The likely compromise will be for the bank to tighten monetary policy this year, but by the smallest increments. 

Markets are now pricing in 60 basis points of rate hikes by the end of the year but policymakers have been more cautious, with not a single one calling for moves so large. 
The risk, however, is that big inflation surprises could force the ECB to tighten more quickly and play catch-up later on.

91,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 09:21AM ET</span>",,,,,"MADRID (Reuters) - New car registrations in Spain fell more than 30% in March as a partial trucker strike delayed deliveries of vehicles and parts and deepened existing supply-chain issues, industry body Anfac said on Friday.
A global semiconductor shortage and other logistical struggles as economies emerge from the pandemic slump have dampened deliveries of cars globally, leading to record low sales in Europe.
But the situation is particularly severe in Spain where thousands of truckers staged a walkout of more than two weeks in protest at what they saw as the government's inaction over soaring fuel prices.
Anfac said registrations of new cars were down 30.2% from a year earlier and 51% from March 2019, before the pandemic struck. By contrast in neighbouring France, registrations fell 19.5% from March 2021 and 35% from March 2019.
Bucking the strong downward trend, electric car registrations rose 17.6% from a year ago, albeit from low figures. 
Anfac's Communication Director Noemi Navas said striking drivers of car-transporter trucks had severely affected deliveries to customers. 

""In addition to the raw-material supply crisis and rising energy prices, brands have thousands of vehicles sitting idle in production lots due to distribution difficulties,"" she said in a statement. 
While the organisation stressed supply-side issues were the main challenge, it voiced concerns that economic uncertainty in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine could in the future weigh on demand too.

“Today’s report suggests that the labor market should continue to do well, and that’s a great fundamental support for the (stock) market, and in terms of the inversions, the market can look through some of these yield curve inversions, and I would only become more concerned if a greater number of points on that yield curve started to invert. That’s when the market would become more concerned, you’d see buy the dip behavior wane, we’d see investors become more conservative and maybe even more fearful of a recession. But right now, with just a couple of points moving into inversion and then back out, investors should discount that for now and look at the still strong fundamentals in the economy.”
RANDY FREDERICK, MANAGING DIRECTOR, TRADING AND DERIVATIVES, SCHWAB CENTER FOR FINANCIAL RESEARCH
“This was a pretty solid report that was pretty much expected. Inflation is still problem obviously. It certainly doesn't change the Fed's actions or what the Fed's likely actions are going to be. I think that we've already kind of been told not explicitly, but pretty close to that, that we're going to get a half point right rate hike on May 4.”
“We got PCE numbers yesterday, that show the inflation is still pretty high but we had wages go up about the same amount. So I don't think that this really changes a whole lot of anything.”
MARVIN LOH, GLOBAL MACRO STRATEGIST, STATE STREET, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS
“From the perspective of the Fed and inflation, maybe it was a little bit too good of a number. But based on the fact that the employment rate continued to go down, the number of people coming back into the workforce is keeping pace with the jobs out there, and a rebound in the earnings number shows that the pace of wage gains is continuing although a little bit slower as we get towards a more normalized number."" 
JUAN PEREZ, DIRECTOR OF TRADING, MONEX USA, WASHINGTON
""The good job figures mean that the U.S. economy has been resilient to the negative impact from the conflict as the post-pandemic recovery remains strong. The Fed will certainly feel pressure to stay the course on its hike path although now many doubt the global economy should be taking in higher borrowing costs. We believe the buck will continue to be volatile and be pulled in different directions as long as there remains a lack of clarity on how long the war will go on."" 
JIM PAULSEN, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, THE LEUTHOLD GROUP, MINNEAPOLIS 
    ""It's a decent wage increase but it's not frightening, like wage costs running out of control. You had a little bit of an uptick in the participation rate, which again, was good."" 
    ""What it does is quell fears the economy is falling off a cliff. This is a very good report and it didn't deliver an overheated blow either. It's kind of benign but a little on the positive sign. It might lift GDP estimates for the quarter which could affect earnings estimates.""
    ""It helps reduce fears the economy is really slowing or weakening. It's not. At the same time it doesn't add to inflation fears in a dramatic way.""
""I don't see where this is a market moving report. It's not an outlier. It wasn't super strong or super weak.""
KARL SCHAMOTTA, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, CORPAY, TORONTO
""Another strong print is sustaining expectations for two or more jumbo-sized Fed hikes in the coming months, and has added to momentum driving the dollar higher. Global risk sentiment continues to deteriorate and lift the greenback as hopes for a ceasefire in Ukraine fade, while commodity-linked currencies are coming under pressure as policy changes cap the potential for further gains.""
PAUL NOLTE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, KINGSVIEW INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, CHICAGO
""The data suggests that the labor market is still very strong. The underlying indication is that the economy remains very strong.""
""With the wage growth of 5% plus y-o-y for probably the second or third month in a row - the risks now of wage price spiraling higher are increasing. It increases the chance that the Fed goes 50 basis points at their next meeting in May. The Fed is going to be focused a lot more on inflation at this point, and will be looking to raise rates.”
""I think the economy is still very strong and the Fed should feel comfortable in raising interest rates at this point, at least initially, without fearing that they're going to dump the economy into a recession.""
OLIVER PURSCHE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, WEALTHSPIRE ADVISORS, WESTPORT, CONNECTICUT
    ""There doesn't seem to be anything overly surprising in the jobs report, other than it being relatively strong. Overall, this is a positive report for investors. The U.S. economy, despite COVID and related headwinds that persist and global events that are driving inflation, is very resilient, and that's a good thing. And that bodes wells for the upcoming earnings season, which is ultimately going to be the big driver of market returns.""
SHAWN CRUZ, DIRECTOR OF DERIVATIVES STRATEGY, TD AMERITRADE, CHICAGO 
“It was the wage increase, it wasn’t awful but if there was one thing I noticed yesterday was when we got the income and expenditures was that there was a little bit of a slowdown in spending and some people could view that as just not keeping up with inflation. And it doesn’t look like the wage growth here was quite enough to keep up with some of the inflation we are seeing either, so there is a little bit of concern around what does that mean for consumer spending, that is one area that might create some concern.”
“Generally speaking, there was a little bit of an expectation that maybe a lot of this inflation was going to start pulling people back into the labor market, getting more people back to work, and undershooting that a little bit is another area where there is going to be a little bit of concern as well. But there is still enough of a wage increase component in this – average hourly earnings were up 5.6% - which is still a decent jump where that keeps the Fed in the spot where that is still inflationary and that is still going to keep the expectation that everyone had before that they are going to have to tighten in place.” 
""Right now the catalyst is wages not keeping pace with inflation but inflation also forcing the Fed to continue to have to tighten policy aggressively.” 
PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“It’s decent report, but it carries wage pressures and a half-percent (interest rate) rise at (the Fed’s) May meeting is a near certain. And if inflation accelerates even further then at the June meeting, we’re looking at another half-percent rise.” 

“Basically, the report is good, but it just means the Fed is going to get more hawkish.”
“In terms of the market, it’s coming off a little bit. Yields are moving higher the dollar is moving higher. It’s the beginning of a new quarter, we’ll probably have a mixed to positive trading session based on the news.”

Investing.com -- The U.S. labor market tightened again in March with the jobless rate falling to a new post-pandemic low, even though the economy created fewer jobs than expected.
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 431,000 in the month through mid-March, well below consensus forecasts for a rise of 490,000. However, the shortfall was completely offset by an upward revision of 72,000 to February's data, bringing the previous month's gain to 750,000. 
As a result, the unemployment rate fell to 3.6% from 3.8% in February, a little below forecasts for 3.7%.  The U6 unemployment rate, which captures a broader range of under-employed people, also fell sharply to 6.9% of the workforce from 7.2%. Both numbers are the lowest since the start of the pandemic, although Oxford Economics analyst Greg Daco pointed out that the U.S. is still some 1.6 million jobs short of pre-Covid emploment levels.
""Despite the slight headline 'miss', revisions and stronger than expected unemployment and underemployment data make this a reasonable release,"" said the World Gold Council's John Reade via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
Average hourly earnings also grew by more than expected, reflecting a further shift of the balance of power in the labor market toward workers. The U.S. economy had over 11 million vacant jobs in March, according to a survey released earlier in the week by the Labor Department. Earnings grew 5.6% on the year through March, their fastest rate since March 2020. 
Markets were relatively untroubled by the report, which broadly reaffirmed existing perceptions of the state of the economy. The dollar index quickly reversed its initial gains on the numbers to trade at 98.537, up 0.2% on the day. Likewise, the upward drift in U.S. Treasury bond yields continued but didn't gain any fresh momentum. By 8:50 AM ET (1250 GMT), the 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield was at 2.42%, up 1 basis point on the day.
That small movement was, however, enough to take it below the 2-Year Treasury note  yield, sparking fresh chatter about the shape of the yield curve. When short rates rise above long ones, it is generally taken as a signal of a growth slowdown or even a recession ahead. However, the spread between 3-Month rates and 10-year rates - seen by many as more important because the money used to fund many positions in the bond market is borrowed at very short tenors - remains clearly positive. A number of Federal Reserve officials have also flagged the need for the Fed to sell off its longer-date bonds more quickly, in order to keep that spread positive. "

Imports from China to the EU jumped by more than a fifth last year to 472 billion euros ($522 billion) compared to 2020, Eurostat data showed, widening the bloc's trade deficit with the country to 249 billion euros. 
EU exports to China grew by a comparatively smaller 10%, a significantly faster rate than to other countries outside the bloc.
The report came as EU and Chinese leaders met for their first summit in two years, where Brussels pressed Beijing for assurances it would not supply Russia with arms nor help Moscow circumvent Western sanctions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine.
China was last year the EU's largest import partner and third-biggest export destination according to Eurostat, after the United States and Britain.
Telecoms equipment, data processors and electrical kit made up the bulk of EU imports from China, while it largely exported cars and car parts into the world's biggest automotive market.
Netherlands posted by far the largest deficit at nearly 95 billion euros, while Germany - China's top exporter and second-biggest importer within the bloc - recorded the largest surplus. 

Eurostat said the onset of the coronavirus crisis had slowed EU-China trade in the first months of 2020, though these quickly recovered throughout the pandemic and hit peaks in 2021.

Investing.com -- Inflation in the eurozone hit its highest level since the creation of the single currency in March, as a combination of loose fiscal and monetary policy, supply chain constraints and surging energy prices mixed a toxic cocktail for the economy.
The consumer price index rose 7.5% on the year, from 5.9%, after leaping 2.5% in the month of March alone. The rise in core prices, which excludes more volatile elements such as fuel and energy, was even more severe at 3.0%. 
Economists had expected the headline annual rate to rise only to 6.6%. 
The numbers were released only a couple of hours after a raft of closely-watched business surveys showed business activity slowing sharply in March, although they still continued to signal economic expansion. IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers Index for Eurozone manufacturers fell to 56.5, its lowest level in over a year and also worse than consensus forecasts. The data are among the first to incorporate the timeframe since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, sparking the worst armed conflict on the continent for 30 years.
The data will pile pressure on the European Central Bank to tighten monetary policy faster than it currently intends to do. The ECB's deposit rate is still stuck at -0.5%, and it doesn't plan to raise it until it has wound down its bond-buying program, which will happen no earlier than the summer under its current guidance. 
""There may be an acceleration in the pace of the QE program taper, but any ECB movement on rates seems unlikely until the end of Q3,"" said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer of BlueBay Asset Management, in a note to clients.
However, he suggested that year-on-year rates are unlikely to rise much further, due largely to base effects. By summer, he noted ""inflation is likely to be heading lower. Therefore, we may currently be witnessing a moment of peak pressure on central banks.""
The euro was relatively little affected by the numbers, falling 0.1% to $1.1055, while the yield on the benchmark German 10-Year  government bond rose three basis points to 0.58%, having hit a four-year high of 0.72% earlier in the week in response to preliminary German data for the month, before falling sharply on Thursday.
Markets are currently betting that the ECB will succumb to the pressure and raise interest rates more quickly, following the example of a U.S. Federal Reserve which has drastically accelerated its timeframe for tightening monetary policy in recent months. Short-term interest rate futures suggest the ECB may raise its key deposit rate to 1.5% by the end of 2023. 
Earlier this week, ECB President Christine Lagarde stressed again that any rises in interest rates would be gradual, and that the spike in prices is still likely to be temporary, even though it will be higher and last longer than first expected. The ECB's staff forecasts - which will come under increasing scrutiny in light of the current overshoot - still assume that core inflation will be below 2% in 2023 and 2024."

The S&P Global/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 55.2 - revised down from a preliminary ""flash"" reading of 55.5 - from 58.0 in February.
The survey's gauge of new orders sank to its lowest level since January 2021, hurt by slowing domestic demand and the sixth drop in seven months for export orders.
Survey compiler S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) linked the weakness in export orders to geopolitical tensions, Brexit and ongoing difficulty with supply chains, though delays were their shortest since October 2020.
Overall, the survey pointed to tougher times ahead for Britain's economy, with growth set to slow amid a global surge in inflation pressure, fuelled by turmoil in commodity markets following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
""The end of the opening quarter saw a marked growth slowdown in the UK manufacturing sector,"" S&P Global said.

The survey's indicators of input costs and output prices rose in March after they had receded in previous months from record high levels, pointing to persistent inflation pressure.
Consumer price inflation hit a 30-year high of 6.2% in February and the government's budget watchdog last week forecast it would go close to 9% in late 2022, contributing to the biggest fall in living standards since at least the 1950s.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Global factory activity slowed in March as Russia's invasion of Ukraine tightened supply chain bottlenecks, dampened demand and whacked confidence, while soaring energy costs drove a broader surge in prices, surveys showed on Friday.
Uncertainty caused by the invasion, combined with an intensifying cost-of-living crisis, suggests the euro zone's manufacturing industry could slide into a recession this quarter.
""Today's figures show the worsening supply chain situation is having a major impact on the industry, with rates of both input costs and selling price inflation currently far above anything previously seen,"" said Thomas Rinn, global industrial lead at Accenture (NYSE:ACN).
""The ever-surging cost of power, freight delays and diversions, topped by new COVID-19 lockdowns in China, have all contributed to increased costs and raw material shortages - leaving European manufacturers faced with unprecedented disruption.""

German manufacturers reported slower growth and far more pessimistic expectations for factory activity, and French manufacturing growth eased a bit more than forecast.
Confidence indicators in the region have plummeted and the euro zone future output PMI plunged to its lowest reading since May 2020.

ASIA STRAIN
Asian factories saw activity slow as slumping Chinese demand and rising raw material costs strained firms, and although Japan benefited from easing COVID-19 infections the spike in fuel and grain costs clouded the outlook for economies reliant on energy imports.
China's factory activity slumped at the fastest pace in two years in March, a private sector PMI showed, as the fallout from the Ukraine crisis and resurgence in domestic coronavirus cases hit external and domestic demand.
The outcome was in line with Thursday's official data showing activity in Chinese manufacturing and services simultaneously contracted for the first time since the height of the country's COVID-19 outbreak in 2020.
The slowdown in China bodes ill for Asia, which is host to big manufacturers dependent on consumption in the world's second-largest economy, analysts say.
South Korea's factory activity slowed with new export orders posting the sharpest reduction since July 2020, as companies took a hit from rising input prices for goods ranging from oil and metals to semiconductors.
Factory activity also slowed in Taiwan and Vietnam, and contracted in Malaysia, as the region felt the pain from rising raw material prices, other PMIs released on Friday showed.
""The main channel for transmission is going to be from commodity prices, so energy, oil, gas, as well as foodstuff,"" said Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
""What's going to happen is that the manufacturers, especially some of the more downstream ones, they're going to face a bit more cost pressure,"" he said.
By contrast, Japan saw manufacturing activity grow at a faster pace than the prior month, as domestic demand got a lift from the waning impact of the pandemic.

But Japan's export orders slumped as external demand suffered from pandemic curbs in China and supply chain disruptions caused by Russia's war in Ukraine.
South Korea's PMI fell to 51.2 in March from 53.8, the lowest in four months, and Japan's final au Jibun Bank PMI rose to 54.1, up from 52.7.

An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due next week and is seen as a good barometer of economic health, sank to 53.1 from 55.5, its lowest since June 2020, when the bloc was enduring the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic.
""Just as the fading of the latest pandemic wave was creating a tailwind for the euro zone manufacturing recovery, with economies reopening and supply chain bottlenecks easing, the war in Ukraine has created an ominous new headwind,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global.
""Rates of growth have cooled markedly amid sanctions, soaring energy costs and new supply constraints linked to the war.""
Overall demand growth weakened as factories, facing soaring input costs, increased prices at the fastest rate since S&P Global began collecting the data in 2002. Export orders, which includes trade between member countries, declined for the first time since June 2020.
Inflation in the bloc probably jumped to 6.6% last month, data is expected to show later on Friday according to a Reuters poll, likely adding pressure on European Central Bank policymakers to raise interest rates.

Confidence indicators in the region have plummeted and the future output PMI plunged to 54.4 from 68.5, its lowest reading since May 2020.
""Business optimism in the goods-producing sector has collapsed to a level indicative of manufacturing output declining in the second quarter and adding to the risk of the manufacturing sector sliding into a new recession,"" Williamson said.

IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing stood at 54.2, down from 56.9 in February but still well above the 50.0 mark that separates expansion from contraction.
""Unsurprisingly given the uncertainty and instability caused by the war in Ukraine, the Spanish manufacturing sector expanded at a slower rate,"" IHS Markit's economist Paul Smith said. 
A strike by truckers against fuel price hikes and rising costs caused supply chain disruptions that hampered production, he added.

Hitherto rising optimism was dampened somewhat during the month, IHS Markit said. ""Firms signalled they were bracing for a challenging period.""
After expanding a slower-than-expected 5.1% in 2021, the Spanish economy has been expected to grow faster this year. But the government's 7% target is under threat from the impact the war is having on inflation and trade.

New home prices in 100 cities grew 0.03% on month, matching the rise in February, according to data from China Index Academy, one of the country's largest independent real estate research firms.
China's rattled property sector has gained some momentum in larger cities since the beginning of the year as authorities take policy action to stoke buyers' interest and ease a liquidity crunch at some major developers. 
Premier Li Keqiang early in March called for city-specific property measures to meet home buyers' demand, paving the way for local authorities to relax some curbs based on their city's own conditions.
In March, around 20 small and medium-sized cities announced steps to boost demand, such as allowing smaller down payments, cuts in mortgage rates, subsidies and lower curbs on purchases. 
Fuzhou, the capital of the southeastern province of Fujian, this week relaxed curbs on home buying in five districts and allowed some buyers to pay down payments with housing provident funds.
But overall demand remains weak, with 53 of the 100 cities surveyed reporting declines in new home prices in March, compared with a decline in 52 cities in February, the China Index Academy said. 
Real estate market woes in small cities have not improved. Prices in tier-three and tier-four cities dropped 0.02% month on month, after a 0.01% fall in February.
New home prices in tier-one cities including Shanghai, which has been fighting a major COVID outbreak since March, rose 0.03%, slowing from February's 0.17% gain.
The pace of recovery in the real estate market was interrupted to some extent by the COVID outbreaks, with the markets in Shanghai and some other areas experiencing spikes in cases looking ""dim"", according to the China Index Academy.
""Although local governments continue to ease some local property curbs, the pace appears moderate, and we continue to believe Beijing will stick to most of its major property curbs,"" Nomura analysts said in a note on Friday.
Most property developers in their full-year financial results conferences said they expected to see recovery in the second quarter.
Chairman Yu Liang at China Vanke said the sector is returning to a ""normal, rational"" stage as the central government reassures on healthy development of the sector.
Regulators and governments at all levels will introduce more policies to stabilise the market, Yu said.

Visitor volume of first-home buyers at development projects in March has returned to end-December levels, said state-backed Greentown China, and added it expected to see recovery in the second quarter.
""The darkest time is behind us,"" said CIFI Holdings said, but cautioned low-tier cities will remain under pressure.

The S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 44.1 from 48.6 in the previous month, well below the 50.0 mark that separates expansion from contraction.
The survey did not mention that Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, or the harsh economic sanctions against Moscow that that move triggered. 
Manufacturing firms registered another deterioration in vendor performance, S&P Global said. 
""Lead times lengthened substantially, and to the greatest extent on record amid severe material shortages,"" it said.
Companies also said material shortages were hampering efforts to replenish stocks. 

The survey recorded the most substantial increase in selling prices on record, and the sharpest uptick in input prices since the series began in September 1997. 
Employment declined for a second consecutive month, linked to the fall in client demand and new orders, with the rate of job-shedding quickening to its fastest since July 2020.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 48.1 in March, indicating the steepest rate of contraction since February 2020, from 50.4 in the previous month.
The 50-point index mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The deterioration in manufacturing conditions was broadly in line with the official PMI released on Thursday, which showed activity contracted at the quickest rate since October 2021. The private-sector Caixin survey focuses more on small firms in coastal regions compared with the official survey.
""The average of the two (PMIs) is now under 50, and apart from the initial pandemic hit in 2020, is now at its lowest since February 2016,"" said Sheana Yue, China economist at Capital Economics.
""Given the composition of the firms surveyed, the sharper reduction in the Caixin reading suggests the deterioration was more significant among smaller private firms and exporters.""
Demand also weakened markedly, both domestically and overseas. 
A sub-index for new orders declined at the sharpest rate since February 2020 when China grappled with the first wave of COVID-19 outbreaks, leading to a 6.8% contraction in gross domestic product in the first quarter of 2020.
In particular, the decline in new export orders in March accelerated, as surveyed companies said the latest virus outbreaks in China, disruptions in shipping sector and greater market uncertainties from the Ukraine crisis led customers to cancel or suspend orders.
Input cost inflation hit a five-month high, with a number of factories attributing higher prices to tight global supply chains, which was exacerbated by the war in Ukraine.
The world's second-largest economy, which picked up pace in the first two months of year, is now at risk of slowing sharply as authorities restrict production and mobility in COVID-hit cities, including major economic centres like Shanghai and Shenzhen.
That has slowed output growth with the sub-index for production at 46.4 in March, the lowest since February 2020. 
Government officials have vowed to roll out policies to stabilise the economy as downward economic pressure builds, a cabinet meeting said on Wednesday.
The possibility of the People's Bank of China cutting reserve requirement ratios in April has risen as economic headwinds intensified, according to a state-run China Daily report, citing experts. 
One bright spot in the otherwise sluggish Caixin survey was the employment index, which expanded for the first time in eight months, as factories ramped up hiring after the Lunar New Year holiday.

""The prospect of the war between Russia and Ukraine is uncertain, and the commodity market convulsed,"" said Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group, in a statement accompanying the data release.

Investing.com – Chinese factory activity dropped at the fastest pace in two years in March 2022. Production and demand fell sharply thanks to the latest COVID-19 outbreaks and the economic impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.
The Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was 48.1, the steepest rate of contraction since February 2020. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a figure of 50, while the previous month’s reading was 50.4. The 50-point index mark separates growth from contraction.
National Bureau of Statistics data from the day before showed that the manufacturing PMI was 49.5 and the non-manufacturing PMI was 48.4.
""The average of the two PMIs is now under 50, and apart from the initial pandemic hit in 2020, is now at its lowest since February 2016,"" Capital Economics China economist Sheana Yue told Reuters.
""Given the composition of the firms surveyed, the sharper reduction in the Caixin reading suggests the deterioration was more significant among smaller private firms and exporters.""
Domestic and overseas demand has also weakened markedly, with a decline in new export orders accelerating in March. The latest COVID-19 outbreaks in China, disruptions in the shipping sector, and greater market uncertainties from the Ukraine crisis led customers to cancel or suspend orders, said the surveyed companies.
Several factories also blamed tight global supply chains for higher prices, and the war in Ukraine also contributed to input cost inflation hitting a five-month high.
The COVID-19 outbreaks in cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen, and the ensuing lockdowns, add to the risk of a sharp slowdown in the economy. The State Council has already pledged to roll out policies to stabilize the economy, it said at a meeting on Wednesday.

Wang also called for more help for vulnerable groups and small businesses, noting the government must strike a balance between maintaining normal production and public health and safety.

Activity in the sector, however, saw a sharp decline in new export orders, as external demand suffered from pandemic curbs in China and Russia's war in Ukraine, which caused supply chain disruptions and price pressures to worsen.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 54.1 in March, up from a 53.2 flash reading and the previous month's final of 52.7.
The reading meant manufacturing activity came in above the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the 14th straight month.
""The Japanese manufacturing sector saw an improvement in operating conditions at the end of the first quarter,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""New order inflows saw a quickening in growth, as firms recovered from the surge in COVID-19 cases at the start of the year.""
The PMI survey showed, however, that new export orders fell at the sharpest rate in 20 months, suggesting less stable conditions in overseas markets.
The drop in export orders followed the reintroduction of coronavirus restrictions in parts of China and the Russia-Ukraine war, Bhatti said. Russia calls its action in Ukraine a ""special operation"".
""Anecdotal evidence also linked the war to exacerbated price and supply pressures,"" Bhatti said.
Manufacturers recorded the steepest rise in input prices since August 2008, the survey showed, following a rapid increase in the price of oil and other raw materials.

Firms' optimism about output conditions for the 12 months ahead became slightly less positive on the downside overseas risks, while they also reported a deterioration in lead times amid material shortages.
""There was a survey-record increase in stocks of inputs as firms sought to grow safety stocks and unused inputs accumulated due to shortages of critical components,"" Bhatti said.

The Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 51.2 in March from 53.8 in February, standing above the 50-mark threshold that indicates expansion in activity. It was the 18th straight month of expansion, although it was the lowest in four months.
""South Korean manufacturers reported that sharp price rises and sustained supply chain disruption had hindered production and demand at the end of the first quarter of the year,"" said Usamah Bhatti, an economist at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI).
""Moreover, manufacturing firms noted the impact that economic sanctions on Russia and the war with Ukraine had on international demand, with new export sales falling at the fastest pace since mid-2020.""
New export orders returned to contraction in three months and posted the sharpest reduction since July 2020, as respondents were reportedly pressured by higher raw material prices and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Overall new orders barely grew with the sub-index standing at 50.4.
Output also shrank in the same month, the first contraction in three months.

Friday's survey pointed to a further rise in input prices, notably in oil, metals and semiconductors, extending the current sequence of inflation to 21 months.
Still, firms remained optimistic over the coming year about hopes that price pressures and supply imbalances would ease and drive up demand at home and from abroad.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese business confidence hit a nine-month low in the first quarter, a central bank survey showed, as companies took a hit from supply disruptions and surging raw material costs caused by the Ukraine crisis.
Companies expect conditions to worsen further three months ahead as rising input costs squeeze margins, the Bank of Japan's closely-watched ""tankan"" survey showed on Friday.
The survey also showed companies expect inflation to hit 1.8% a year from now, up from 1.1% in the December poll and the highest forecast on record - highlighting Japan's rising upward price pressure.
""The tankan highlighted a strong sense of caution among manufacturers, particularly automakers, over rising raw material costs and chip shortages,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""The outlook is uncertain, too, due to the Ukraine crisis and slowing Chinese growth,"" he said.
The tankan's headline index gauging big manufacturers' mood slipped to plus 14 in March from plus 17 in December, worsening for the first time in seven quarters and hitting the lowest level since June 2021. It exceeded market forecasts of plus 12.
Big non-manufacturers' sentiment index also worsened for the first time in seven quarters at plus 9, down slightly from plus 10 three months ago but exceeding market forecasts of plus 5.
Food, auto and electric machinery makers saw sentiment worsen, as well as construction and retail sectors, in a sign of the wide-ranging hit from surging import costs.
An index gauging big manufacturers' output prices rose to a 40-year high, the tankan showed, a sign more firms are putting higher price tags on their goods.
Big firms expect to increase capital spending plans by 2.2% for the current fiscal year that began in April, less than a market forecast for a 4.0% gain, the tankan showed.
The outcome will be among factors BOJ policymakers will scrutinise in producing fresh quarterly growth and inflation projections at their next meeting on April 27-28.

Soaring fuel and food prices blamed on the Ukraine war, coupled with rising import bills from a weak yen, have added to pain for households and Japan's economy still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic's hit.
Analysts expect Japan's core consumer inflation to approach the central bank's 2% target as early as in April, though the BOJ has said it will not respond to cost-push inflation with policy tightening.

The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said new job postings fell by 25% in the last week of March from a week earlier, returning to the kind of increase seen in mid-January.
""The jobs market has been super-heated in the first few months of this year, and was always likely to stabilise in the spring. We may be seeing the first signs of that now,"" REC chief executive Neil Carberry said.
""Over the next few weeks, we will see whether this is the cooling we expected, or a slower market developing as employers factor rising inflation into their plans.""
Staff shortages are a worry for the Bank of England which has raised interest rates at each of its last three meetings to try to stop the jump in inflation to a 30-year high of 6.2% from turning into a longer-term price growth problem.

REC said demand was for hairdressers and barbers as well as security and bar staff and there were also big increases in adverts for other skilled occupations such as veterinarians and crane drivers. 
The total of 1.83 million active jobs ads had been stable since early March, it said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -The Canadian economy likely gathered momentum in February, growing for a ninth consecutive month after a January gain, data from Statistics Canada showed on Thursday, prompting economists to revise up first quarter projections.
Real gross domestic product probably grew 0.8% in February, led by increases in manufacturing and resources, Statscan said in a flash estimate. The economy expanded 0.2% in January - matching expectations - despite increased pandemic restrictions. 
The robust start to the year sets the stage for first quarter GDP to come in well ahead of the Bank of Canada's current forecast of 2.0%, said economists.
""Heading into the year, some slowdown in activity was expected due to the pandemic restrictions, but, unlike in past waves, that wasn't the case,"" said Benjamin Reitzes, Canadian rates and macro strategist at BMO Capital Market Economics, in a note.
""Accordingly, it looks like Q1 GDP growth will clock in at around a 4% annualized rate.""
With February's gain, Canada's economy is now 1.2% above pre-pandemic levels, Statscan said. That may add to pressure on the Bank of Canada to move aggressively on rate hikes when it meets in mid-April.
""The Bank may follow through with the recent pledge ... that it will be forceful in combating inflation, potentially by hiking interest rates by 50 bp,"" said Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics, in a note.
Inflation has surged to 5.7% and money markets see a 50% chance of a 50-basis point hike, to 1.0%, on April 13.[BOCWATCH]
In January, activity among goods-producing industries jumped, led by a strong rebound in construction and a surge in demand for utilities. 
Services were flat as the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant led to more restrictions, though the February flash estimate suggested a partial reversal for accommodation and food services.

Statistics Canada also revised upwards the December GDP growth rate to 0.1% from flat. 
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.3% lower at 1.2517 to the greenback, or 79.89 U.S. cents, as oil fell and the U.S. dollar jumped on waning hopes of progress at Russia-Ukraine peace talks.

Kantar measured the sales between March 6 and 20, compared to the same period a year ago, and their total increase far outpaced a 5% rise in Spanish mass consumer products prices in the same two weeks, meaning sales volumes were growing.
""Spain's shoppers are starting to change their habits and it is directly related to the concern they are showing about the current scenario,"" said Kantar, adding that 90% of consumers surveyed were worried about the impact of the conflict that began on Feb. 24.
Supermarket chains across the country have limited sales of sunflower oil, which is mostly imported from Ukraine, and the truck-drivers strike created sporadic shortages of staples like milk and flour.
Earlier this week, Spain temporarily authorised stores to limit the sale of some products to prevent sell-outs when markets are under stress.
Customers were buying more packaged foods and beverages, which accounted for 48.4% of an average grocery basket, compared to 44% a year ago. 
Spanish consumer prices rose 9.8% in March, the fastest increase since 1985, preliminary data showed on Wednesday.
Young people have been particularly hard hit, the Kantar report showed, with consumers under 35 spending 20% more on their purchases of basic goods than a year ago.
In response, consumers are increasingly looking to buy cheaper own-brand products and some 40% are trying to reduce their out-of-home consumption, Kantar said. 

""Consumers are becoming more selective, spending more time looking for cheaper alternatives,"" Juan Aznar, a professor at Barcelona business school Esade told Reuters.

The rate showed no change from the three months through January, and was down four-tenths of a percentage point from the September 2021-November 2021 period.
A Reuters poll of economists had projected that the unemployment rate would be 11.4% in the three months through the end of February.
IBGE researcher Adriana Beringuy noted that the number of employed people was stable compared to the previous three-month period, which may indicate the resumption of a pattern seen before the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to IBGE, the number of officially unemployed Brazilians in this period reached 12 million people, 3.1% lower than the previous three-month period and down 19.5% from the same period last year. 
The average monthly pay of 2,511 reais ($529) for workers was unchanged from the previous three months, but fell 8.8% compared to the same period in 2021. It was also the lowest level for the three months through February since the series started in 2012, according to IBGE, indicating the labor market recovery has been centered in lower-income occupations.

The Economy Ministry has emphasized that job creation will underpin economic growth this year. But private economists continue to project that Brazil's economy, the largest in Latin America, will expand well below official government estimates.

This follows a drop of 7.5% year-over-year in January and a 1.9% decline in copper production in 2021. 
The agency also reported that the Andean country's manufacturing output dropped 2.2% in February, lagging the market forecast of a 0.5% rise. 
The agency said a 9% year-on-year dip in chemical products and substances manufacturing because of lower fertilizer production was largely responsible for the manufacturing drop.
Another contributor to the drop in output was ""less manufacturing of manufactured products of common metals (such as copper or steel) moulded, forged or stamped,"" the agency said.

One sector that did show growth, the agency said, was production of pharmaceutical products due to an increased demand by pharmacies.
On Wednesday Chile's central bank dropped its prediction for 2022 economic growth to 1.0%-2.0% from a previous estimate of 1.5%-2.5% in December.

Investing.com -- U.S. consumer spending slowed sharply in February as the effect of pandemic-driven stimulus programs faded and high inflation started to bite.
Personal spending rose only 0.2% on the month, down from an upwardly revised 2.7% in January, according to figures released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That was comfortably below expectations for a 0.5% rise. That was despite the fact that personal income rose a more respectable 0.5%, in a month when the effects of the winter wave of Covid-19 had already peaked. 
At the same time, the data series widely seen as the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation posted another chunky increase, with the index for personal consumer expenditures rising 0.6% on the month, taking the annual rate to 6.4%. The core rate of PCE inflation rose to 5.2%, both figures representing 40-year highs. Greg Daco, an analyst with Oxford Economics, noted that, adjusted for inflation, spending had fallen 0.4%.
Analysts view the PCE price index as a better guide to inflationary trends because it is quicker to reflect changes in prices for goods and services that are bought more regularly.  
The numbers provided fresh evidence of consumer spending reverting to more normal patterns, after two years punctuated by lockdowns and dominated by working-from-home pushed spending in the direction of home improvements and electronic appliances. The strongest gains were seen in food services and accommodation, along with recreation. By contrast, spending declined most on motor vehicles and parts, and on furnishings. 
That trend may yet have further to run: Oxford's Daco noted that spending on goods is still 7.7% above its pre-Covid trend, while spending on services is nearly 4% below it.
Other data released at the same time showed that initial jobless claims ticked up unexpectedly last week to 202,000, but continuing claims continued their downward run to a new 60-year low of 1.307 million.
""The improvement is likely to continue but remain unsteady as there's not much more room for claims to fall,"" said Daniel Zhao, chief economist with Glassdoor, via Twitter.
The data come a day before the Labor Department's monthly employment report, which is set to show another robust gain in employment as the U.S. economy puts the pandemic behind it. The Department's monthly survey of job openings, released on Wednesday, showed that vacancies continue to trend near record levels, while rising prices and thinning financial cushions, along with the lure of higher wages, push inactive people back into the labor force. "
113,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 08:01AM ET</span>","MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's budget deficit narrowed to 6.76% of gross domestic product last year from over 10% in 2020, beating forecasts from international organisations and the government, which expects a further reduction this year despite a challenging environment.
""At present, with all due caution, the government should be able to meet the deficit target"" of 5%, Budget Minister Maria Jesus Montero told a news conference on Thursday.
The government had initially targeted a budget gap of 8.4% in 2021, and Montero said the lower result ""allows us to better face the challenges from the war in Ukraine"". 
The war and sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine last month have pushed energy prices to record highs across Europe, stoking overall inflation and sapping confidence.
Tax collection soared 15.1% in 2021, allowing the government to meet its revenue forecast for the first time in 10 years, and revenue data were positive so far this year, Montero said, adding that higher social security payments driven by new jobs and hikes to the minimum wage had helped boost tax receipts.
The government attributed the deficit reduction to a stronger economy as it bounced back from a record slump in 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and shrugged off the impact of higher prices on the improved revenue collection as pointed out by some experts.
Inflation last year reached 6.5%, while electricity prices soared by 72%. Year-on-year inflation in March hit 9.8%, highest since 1985.

Spain has to review its economic outlook to include the impact of the war in Ukraine war by April 30, and the government has already said growth would fall short of the current 7% target for this year.
Spanish think-tank Funcas has downgraded its growth forecast to 4.2%, which would significantly reduce the chances of Spain reaching pre-pandemic levels of economic activity this year, as the government had hoped, and its capacity to cut the deficit.

It is the steepest decline since July 2020, during the early months of the pandemic, when sales dropped 23.1%. 
""While the local epidemic has shown signs of easing of late, the retail sector will continue to face notable pressure in the near term,"" a government spokesman said, adding the new round of electronic consumption vouchers in April should provide support to the retail sector.
In volume terms, retail sales in February fell 17.6% from a year earlier, compared with a revised 1.5% growth in January, and was the biggest fall since July 2020, when it dropped 23.8%. 
At the start of this year, Hong Kong implemented its most draconian measures as the Omicron variant caused a dramatic spike in infections, and as a result businesses and the city's economy are reeling from widespread closures.

Overall business activity was steady in March, while the baht depreciated following an escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Bank of Thailand (BOT) said.
Southeast Asia's second-largest economy should, however, remain on the recovery path, senior BOT director Chayawadee Chai-Anant told a news conference.
The economy in ""the first quarter recovered but not strikingly, compared with a very good fourth quarter,"" she said, adding the recovery was expected to continue in the second quarter of this year.
The economy grew a faster-than-expected 1.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021 from a year earlier.
On Wednesday, the BOT trimmed its 2022 economic growth forecast to 3.2% from 3.4% and raised its headline inflation to 4.9%, above its target range of 1%-3%, due to the impact of the war in Ukraine.
In February, the economy recovered due to stronger exports and more foreign tourists after an easing of coronavirus curbs that also helped improve manufacturing, the BOT said in a statement https://www.bot.or.th/English/MonetaryPolicy/EconomicConditions/PressRelease/DocPressRelease/PressEng_February2022_9xp4w3.pdf.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's economy grew more quickly than previously thought in late 2021 but the increase was largely due to COVID-related activity in the health sector, which masked the inflation hit to household incomes and a gloomy picture for the private sector.
Gross domestic product in the world's fifth-biggest economy increased by 1.3% in the fourth quarter, when the Omicron wave of coronavirus cases mounted, official data showed on Thursday.
That was stronger than a preliminary estimate of growth of 1.0% from the previous three-month period.
But the largest contributors to the increase came from health and social work including more visits to doctors, a large increase in coronavirus testing and tracing and an extension of the COVID-19 vaccination programme.
Paul Dales, an economist with consultancy Capital Economics, said the upward revision to GDP was not as encouraging as it looked at first glance.
""A lot of it appears to be due to inventories while consumer spending was revised down,"" he said. ""The latter suggests the squeeze on real incomes is starting to bite, although the fall in the saving rate is providing a cushion.""
Households dipped into their lockdown savings to finance their spending. The saving ratio fell to 6.8% of disposable income from 7.5% in third second quarter, heading back towards its level of 6.0% immediately before the pandemic.
Last week, finance minister Rishi Sunak announced tax cuts to help soften the hit to consumers from surging energy prices which have risen further after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
While fourth-quarter growth pick-up represented an acceleration from the economy's 0.9% expansion in the third quarter, it was well below its 5.6% expansion in the April-June period when it was rebounding from COVID-19 lockdowns.
HOUSEHOLDS HIT
Investors expect the recovery to slow in 2022 as inflation heads for almost 9% and households face the biggest fall in living standards since at least the 1950s, according to forecasts by the government's fiscal watchdog. 
Thursday's data showed household disposable income, adjusted for inflation, fell by 0.2% in the July-September period, revised down from an originally reported 0.5% increase, and it fell again by 0.1% in the fourth quarter.
The dip in the third quarter reflected the increased impact of inflation on household budgets and a downward revision of pension contributions, the Office for National Statistics said.
Household incomes as a share of all income in Britain's economy, which includes business and government income, fell to 72.2%, its lowest since records began in 1987. 
Real household disposable spending in the fourth quarter rose by 0.5%, weaker than an original estimate of 1.2% growth.
Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the data showed companies were also struggling.
White Britain's economic output at the end of 2021 was only 0.1% below where it was at the end of 2019, excluding government expenditure and investment it was 2.9% below its pre-pandemic level, he said.
Britain's balance of payments deficit in the fourth quarter narrowed to 7.3 billion pounds ($9.59 billion), helped by the first surplus since 2011 in the balance of British investment income abroad and foreign investment income in the country.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a deficit of 17.6 billion pounds.
The ONS said the investment account surplus was driven by higher income from British assets in the oil sector abroad and a change in the schedule of dividend payments at home.

As a share of GDP, the overall current account deficit narrowed to 1.2% from 4.9% in the third quarter.

Investing.com – China’s manufacturing and services sectors simultaneously contracted in March 2022 for the first time in two years and highlighted the urgency for more policy intervention to stabilize the economy.
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data released earlier in the day showed that the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) was at 49.5. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a 49.9 figure, while February’s figure was 50.2. The non-manufacturing PMI was at 48.4, compared to the previous month’s 51.6 figure.
The last time both PMIs were both below the 50- mark separating contraction from growth was in February 2020, as COVID began to spread after being detected in the city of Wuhan. More recent outbreaks in cities such as Shanghai and Shenzhen are now pushing the indexes into contraction.
""Recently, clusters of epidemic outbreaks have occurred in many places in China and coupled with a significant increase in global geopolitical instability, production and operation of Chinese enterprises have been affected,"" NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe told Reuters.
Other investors agreed, with Pinpoint Asset Management chief economist Zhiwei Zhang telling Reuters, ""PMI weakened as the omicron outbreaks in many Chinese cities led to lockdowns and disruption of industrial production. As the Shanghai lockdown only happened in late March, economic activities will likely slow further in April.""
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. was one company that recently shut down its plant in Shanghai to comply with COVID-19 measures.
""Due to the epidemic outbreaks, some companies in some areas temporarily reduced production or stopped production, which also affected the normal production and operation of both upstream and downstream companies,"" said NBS’ Zhao.
Some companies also saw the cancellation or reduction of overseas orders due to geopolitical uncertainties, Zhao added.
Weaker production and demand also impacted factory jobs.
""The PMIs probably understated the hit to activity last month. The services index remained above the low of 45.2 that it hit last August during the Delta wave. That's probably because the survey was conducted prior to the worst disruptions,"" Capital Economics senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard told Reuters.
To cushion the impact of new COVID-19 lockdowns, authorities have unveiled steps to support business, including rent exemptions for some small services-sector firms.
The People's Bank of China is also expected to cut rates and lower reserve requirements for banks as downward economic pressures build, according to analysts."

The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.5 from 50.2 in February, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Thursday, while the non-manufacturing PMI eased to 48.4 from 51.6 in February.
The last time both PMI indexes simultaneously were below the 50-point mark that separates contraction from growth was in February 2020, when authorities were racing to arrest the spread of the coronavirus, first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
The world's second-largest economy revved up in January-February, with some key indicators blowing past expectations, but is now at risk of slowing sharply as authorities restrict production and mobility in COVID-hit cities, including Shanghai and Shenzhen.
""Recently, clusters of epidemic outbreaks have occurred in many places in China, and coupled with a significant increase in global geopolitical instability, production and operation of Chinese enterprises have been affected,"" said Zhao Qinghe, senior NBS statistician.
Shanghai's COVID-19 lockdown roiled auto production in recent days as two major suppliers joined Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in shutting plants to comply with measures to control the spread of the coronavirus.
""PMI weakened as the Omicron outbreaks in many Chinese cities led to lockdowns and disruption of industrial production,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. 
""As the Shanghai lockdown only happened in late March, economic activities will likely slow further in April.""
The sub-index for production fell below the 50-point mark for the first time since October, to 49.5, indicating a contraction. The gauge for new orders was also in negative territory. 
""Due to the epidemic outbreaks, some companies in some areas temporarily reduced production or stopped production, which also affected the normal production and operation of both upstream and downstream companies,"" Zhao said.
Some companies also saw the cancellation or reduction of overseas orders due to geopolitical uncertainties, Zhao said.
Weakening production and demand sped up the contraction in factory jobs, with the employment sub-index slipping to 48.6 in March, the lowest since February 2021.
WORST SINCE WUHAN
""The PMIs probably understate the hit to activity last month,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.

To cushion the impact of new COVID-19 lockdowns, authorities have unveiled steps to support business, including rent exemptions for some small services-sector firms.
On Wednesday, the government said it will roll out policies to stabilise the economy as soon as possible amid increased pressures.
The central bank, which kept its benchmark interest rate for corporate and household lending unchanged in March, is expected to cut rates and lower reserve requirements for banks as downward economic pressures build, analysts say. 
China's official composite PMI, which combined manufacturing and services, stood at 48.8 in March versus 51.2 in February.

The composite PMI was at its second-lowest reading on record since February 2020, when the initial COVID outbreak sent the index plummeting to 28.9.
""This suggests that the economy is contracting at its fastest pace since the height of the initial COVID-19 outbreak in February 2020,"" said Evans-Pritchard.

The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 49.5, breaching the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction for the first time in five months, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Thursday. That was lower than the median estimate of 49.8 in a Bloomberg survey of economists. 
The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors slumped to 48.4, below the consensus forecast of 50.3. 
China is battling its worst outbreak since the initial flareup two years ago. Soaring case numbers prompted authorities to lock down major cities including the country’s tech and manufacturing hub Shenzhen, financial center Shanghai and automotive city Changchun this month. 
The drop in both PMIs showed overall economic momentum has declined, said Zhao Qinghe, a senior statistician at the NBS. The market is expected to pick up once the outbreaks are brought under control, he said.
The benchmark CSI 300 Index dropped as much as 0.8% after the release of the data, with industrials and technology shares leading the decline.
Areas covering roughly 30% of China’s gross domestic product are affected by the outbreaks,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). estimates, with the economic costs of the lockdowns likely amounting to at least $46 billion a month, or 3.1% of GDP, according to a researcher from Chinese University of Hong Kong. Several economists have already downgraded their growth forecasts for the first half of the year as lockdowns were expanded.

China’s Premier Li Keqiang reiterated Wednesday that China will stick to its full-year growth target despite new challenges and increased downward pressures on growth. He called on the nation to prioritize stable growth and to draft contingency plans to deal with possible greater uncertainties at a regular State Council meeting. Policies to stabilize growth should be rolled out as early as possible, while measures that would dampen market expectations should be avoided, he said. 
Shenzhen Lockdown
Companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). supplier Foxconn temporarily halted production in Shenzhen during a week-long lockdown of the city. In Changchun, an industrial hub that accounted for about 11% of China’s total annual car output in 2020, automakers like  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp. were forced to shut. Some businesses resumed production by adopting a so-called closed loop system in which workers were kept at factory locations and tested regularly. 
The disruptions affected “the stability of manufacturing supply chain,” Zhao said, noting the index measuring delivery time of suppliers fell to 46.5, the lowest since February 2020.
The index measuring new export orders dropped further into contraction, falling to 47.2 in March from 49 in the previous month. Orders were reduced or canceled at some companies due to the “recent escalation in geopolitical conflicts,” the NBS said.
Employment was also affected during the month, with the sub-index for manufacturing jobs dropping to 48.6 in March from 49.2 in February. 
“Some companies surveyed said due to the Covid impact, there was insufficient employees working in their posts, logistics were clogged, and delivery cycle was extended,” Zhao said.
In-person services sectors like restaurants and retail shops were hit hard by the renewed lockdowns and tightened social distancing measures, dragging the official non-manufacturing index lower. Economists say the damage to consumption could be deeper and more long-lasting than to production. 
The world’s second-largest economy was already struggling even before the current wave of outbreaks following a slump in the property market and weakness in consumer spending. The government has pledged more monetary and fiscal stimulus to help bolster the economy and meet a growth target of “around 5.5%” for the year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese factories posted their first rise in output in three months in February as resilience in global demand led to a rebound in car production, a welcome sign for policymakers hoping to keep the country's fragile economic recovery on track.
The increase, however, was smaller than market expectations, underscoring the lingering impact of supply chain bottlenecks and other risks such as surging costs of raw materials.
Factory output rose 0.1% in February from the previous month, official data showed on Thursday, as growing production of cars and transport equipment offset a decline in chemicals.
That meant output returned to growth after slipping 0.8% in January and 1.0% in December. The increase was weaker than a 0.5% gain forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
The outlook for the world's third-largest economy has weakened after energy and commodity prices soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month. Prices for raw materials have surged, saddling exporters with higher input costs, while supply chain disruptions have increased.
""The situation in Ukraine is likely to worsen the parts shortage further,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research.
""It feels like there's a risk the recovery in output will be delayed further.""
Japanese automakers and suppliers are also facing headwinds from coronavirus-related disruptions in China, the world's largest market.
Thursday's data showed output of cars and other motor vehicles gained 10.9% from the previous month in February, rebounding after a sharp contraction in January as pressure from parts shortages eased.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expected output to advance 3.6% in March and 9.6% in April.
But those forecasts, however, did not take into account any output disruptions caused by a powerful magnitude 7.4 earthquake that struck off Japan's northeastern coast on March 16, which led to plant shutdowns at  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and other firms.

Japanese firms' production plans for the months ahead are increasingly far too optimistic, said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics, highlighting possible risks going into next quarter. 
""Fresh headwinds of potential supply chain disruption in Russia and China may keep the handbrake on Japanese industrial production, pushing back any rebound until later in the year.""

Inflation in Russia has accelerated sharply in the past few weeks as the rouble's fall to an all-time low boosted demand for a wide range of goods, from food staples to cars, on expectations that their prices will rise even higher.
In February, annual inflation in Russia was at 9.15%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. private employers maintained a brisk pace of hiring in March, in a boost to the labor market recovery, but growth in corporate profits slowed significantly in the fourth quarter amid increasing costs.
Private payrolls increased by 455,000 jobs last month, the ADP National Employment Report showed on Wednesday. Data for February was revised higher to show 486,000 jobs added instead of the initially reported 475,000. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would increase by 450,000 jobs.
Medium-sized and large companies accounted for 80% of the private jobs created last month. 
Manufacturers added 54,000 jobs, while the leisure and hospitality sector hired 161,000 more workers. There were also sizeable gains in professional and business services payrolls as well as healthcare and education. Trade, transportation and utilities companies also boosted hiring, but construction hiring slowed for a third straight month. 
Demand for workers is being boosted by the rolling back of COVID-19 restrictions across the country amid a massive decline in coronavirus cases. There is no sign that Russia's more than one-month long war against Ukraine has hurt the labor market.
First-time applications for unemployment benefits are at 52-1/2-year lows, while the number of Americans on jobless rolls is the smallest since 1970. 
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics and was published ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive and closely watched employment report for March on Friday. It has, however, a poor record predicting the private payrolls count in the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics employment report because of methodology differences.
""The ADP report hasn't proved a useful guide to the payrolls figures in recent months, but it does echo the fairly upbeat message from other indicators,"" said Andrew Hunter, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.
U.S. stocks were mostly lower. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.
WORKER SHORTAGE 
Government data on Tuesday showed there were a near record 11.3 million job openings on the last day of February, which left the jobs-workers gap at 3.0% of the labor force and close to the post war high of 3.2% in December. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 490,000 jobs in March. The economy created 678,000 jobs in February.
But the upbeat news on the economy was dampened by a separate report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showing that corporate profits growth slowed significantly in the fourth quarter as domestic financial corporations suffered a decrease. Profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations and from the rest of the world increased moderately. 
Corporate profits with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments increased at a 0.7% rate or $20.4 billion in the fourth quarter after rising at a 3.4% pace or $96.9 billion in the third quarter. Profits surged during the pandemic as demand shifted to goods from services.
Profit margins fell to 12.2% last quarter.
""While still elevated by historic comparison, the decline in margins suggests the higher-cost environment is eating into profitability,"" said Jay Bryson, chief economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""With cost pressure remaining persistent and demand slowing, we expect margins to slow further this year as businesses find it increasingly difficult to pass costs onto consumers.""
The robust demand for goods has strained supply chains, with the COVID-19 pandemic sidelining millions of workers around the globe who are needed to produce goods at factories and move them to consumers. That has fueled inflation, which has worsened following the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine by Russia. 
The Federal Reserve this month raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years and signaled an aggressive stance that has left the bond market fearing a recession down the road. The U.S. 2-year/10-year Treasury yield curve, widely tracked for signals on the economy, briefly inverted on Tuesday for the first time since September 2019.
But economists said the Fed's massive holdings of Treasuries and mortgage backed securities made it hard to get a clear read from the yield curve moves. 
""This is likely placing further downward pressure on longer- term rates, and it may only be once balance sheet reduction begins, likely in June, that we will get a better sense of how much this may be distorting long-term yields lower,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.

Gross domestic product increased at a 6.9% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, the government said in its third estimate on Wednesday. The economy grew at a 2.3% rate in the third quarter. Growth is 3.1% above its pre-pandemic level.

Gross domestic product increased at a 6.9% annualized rate, the Commerce Department said in its third estimate of fourth-quarter GDP growth. That was revised slightly down from the 7.0% pace estimated in February. 
The economy grew at a 2.3% rate in the third quarter. Growth is 3.1% above its pre-pandemic level. Economists polled by Reuters had expected GDP growth would be revised up to a 7.1% rate. The revision to the fourth-quarter GDP reading reflected downgrades to consumer spending and export growth.
For all of 2021, the economy grew 5.7%, the strongest since 1984, after the government provided nearly $6 trillion in pandemic relief. It contracted 3.4% in 2020, the biggest drop in 74 years.
But that's all in the rear-view mirror. An onslaught of coronavirus infections contributed to undercutting spending as well as disrupting activity at factories and services businesses early in the year. While infections have dramatically declined, leading to the rolling back of restrictions across the country, inflation is soaring as supply chains remain stretched.
The Federal Reserve this month raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years and signaled an aggressive stance that has left the bond market fearing a recession down the road.

Corporate profits growth slowed significantly in the fourth quarter as domestic financial corporations suffered a decrease. There were also moderate increases in profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations and from the rest of the world. 

Corporate profits with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments increased at a $20.4 billion rate in the fourth quarter after rising at a $96.9 billion pace in
the third quarter.

BERLIN (Reuters) -German annual inflation rose to its highest level in more than 40 years in March as prices of natural gas and oil products soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, preliminary data showed on Wednesday.
Consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries (HICP), rose 7.6% on the year, a steep increase from 5.5% in February, the Federal Statistics Office said.
The national consumer price index (CPI) rose 7.3% year-on-year after recording an inflation rate of 5.1% in February, as companies and service providers passed on the massive rise in energy prices to customers.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the CPI rate to rise to 6.3% and the HICP figure to grow to 6.7%.
""Welcome back to the 1970s! At least as far as food, goods and energy prices are concerned,"" said Jens-Oliver Niklasch at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg.
""The European Central Bank has no choice but to start tightening now,"" said KfW chief economist Fritzi Koehler-Geib in a view echoed by other experts, including Thomas Gitzel at VP Bank Group.
""If currency regulators stay relaxed, there is a risk that their later reaction will have to be all the more drastic. The U.S. Federal Reserve had this painful experience in the early 1980s,"" Gitzel said.
A similarly high inflation rate in Germany was last recorded in autumn 1981, when oil prices had jumped as a consequence of the first Iran–Iraq War, the statistics office said.
Economists said the inflation problem was not unique to Germany. Spain, for example, reported an inflation rate of just under 10% for March earlier on Wednesday.

""The ECB's mantra that inflation rates would be back to the ECB's target level of 2% from next year no longer works,"" Gitzel said. ""For the first time since it was founded, the ECB is in danger of losing its credibility.""
Preliminary inflation data from the German states of Saxony, North-Rhine Westphalia, Bavaria, Hesse, Brandenburg and Baden-Wuerttemberg had suggested annual consumer price inflation (CPI) in a range between 7% and 8%, coming to an average of 7.54%.

The broad-based 455,000 gain in payrolls followed a revised 486,000 increase in February, ADP Research Institute data showed Wednesday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 450,000 advance.
The data are consistent with the Federal Reserve’s view that the labor market is robust and competition for workers remains intense, with many employers offering higher pay to woo job candidates. Fewer pandemic-related health concerns may also be encouraging more Americans to return to the job market as soaring inflation dents household finances.
The data precede the government’s monthly employment report on Friday, which is currently forecast to show that private payrolls increased by about a half million in March. The ADP figures don’t always follow the same pattern as the Labor Department’s data.
ADP’s payroll data represent firms employing nearly 26 million workers in the U.S.
Service Providers
“Businesses are hiring, specifically among the service providers which had the most ground to make up due to early pandemic losses,” Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP, said in a statement. “However, a tight labor supply remains an obstacle for continued growth in consumer-facing industries.”
Service-provider employment rose by 377,000 in March, which included a 161,000 gain in leisure and hospitality. Other sectors like professional and business services and health care advanced.
Payrolls at goods producers increased by 79,000, reflecting a large jump in manufacturing.

The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said the contract rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage shot to 4.8% in the week ended March 25 from 4.5% a week earlier. That was the largest one-week increase since February 2011, and it brought mortgage rates to their highest level since December 2018.
Mortgage rates have now climbed by nearly 1.5 percentage points since the start of the year, the most rapid run-up in home borrowing costs since 1994.
With rates climbing so rapidly, mortgage application activity has fallen sharply in recent weeks. The MBA said its Market Composite Index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, tumbled 6.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis to 425.1, the lowest level since December 2019.

The refinance index dropped 14.9% to the lowest since May 2019, while the purchase index was little changed, MBA said.
Yields on the U.S. Treasury securities that act as a benchmark for mortgage rates have surged in the last month after the Fed lifted its policy rate for the first time since 2018, and policymakers including Chair Jerome Powell have signaled since that they are prepared to raise rates faster and further in the year ahead to rein in inflation that is running at the highest pace in 40 years.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing economic fallout have fuelled inflation worldwide, especially through increasing prices of energy and grains.
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said more expensive electricity and fuel and non-processed food accounted for almost three-quarters of the overall CPI increase. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected 12-month CPI to rise to 8% in March. 
""It is bad data. Bad data that affects our economy, our society, particularly the more vulnerable groups,"" Sanchez told parliament.
Responding to concerns about the rising cost of living, his government passed a series of measures this week aimed at curbing energy prices. 
As inflation in the euro zone speeds up, top European Central Bank officials have insisted the rise is temporary, with ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane describing high inflation as an imported shock that will fade away over time.
""We would still diagnose that this essentially is an imported inflation shock, it's a supply shock,"" Lane said. ""Most of this inflation will fade away.""

Central banks are facing a complicated policy dilemma between keeping calm amid the market turmoil while also responding to mounting price pressures.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese retail sales fell in February for the first time in five months, as extended COVID-19 curbs hit service sector businesses, casting doubts over the prospects of a consumption-led recovery this quarter.
The government lifted coronavirus restrictions across the nation this week, but households remain guarded about rising prices, which have been driven by the Ukraine war and yen's sharp weakening.
Retail sales fell 0.8% in February from a year earlier, government data showed on Wednesday, much weaker than the median market forecast for a 0.3% decrease.
It followed a downwardly revised 1.1% rise in January and marked the first year-on-year contraction since September, when the Delta coronavirus variant overwhelmed hospitals across Japan.
Compared with the previous month, retail sales declined 0.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis in February, following an upwardly revised 0.9% fall in the previous month.
Throughout February, the government has kept curbs in place in most of urban areas across the nation, as coronavirus infections and death tallies hit the record-highs in the month due to the more infectious Omicron variant.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent global commodity rally since late February have posed more downside risks to the world's third-largest economy, which is heavily reliant on imported energy and raw materials.
To protect households and firms from surging costs, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Tuesday instructed officials to draw up an economic relief package by the end of April.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is expected to have eased to 49.9 in March, the lowest reading in five months, from 50.2 in February, according to the median forecast of 36 economists polled by Reuters on Wednesday. 
A reading below 50 indicates contraction from the previous month; anything above 50 indicates expansion.
""We lower our forecast for the official manufacturing PMI to 49.0 from 49.5 previously, in view of the worsening COVID-19 situation, especially in Shanghai. The contracting property sector and slowing export growth are also negative for the manufacturing PMIs in March,"" Nomura analysts said in a note on Friday. There is one official and one unofficial manufacturing PMI.
Following unexpectedly upbeat economic activity data from the National Bureau of Statistics for January and February, analysts warned March data may broadly worsen. 
""Almost all activity data point to a worsening slowdown in recent weeks, due mainly to the escalated anti-Omicron measures and the deteriorating property sector, and we believe the situation could worsen further in Q2,"" Nomura analysts said. 
The latest COVID-19 resurgence has brought about lockdowns in financial centre Shanghai and shutdowns in the tech hub of Shenzhen in March. Changchun, capital of the virus-hit northeastern province Jilin, has completed more than 10 rounds of citywide testing of its residents so far.
The rapidly deteriorating pandemic and escalating control measures added downward pressure on the world's second-largest economy. Premier Li Keqiang said on March the 2022 growth target for GDP was ""around 5.5%"".
China's stringent zero-COVID policy, anti-corruption scrutiny and stepped-up regulation of hidden local-government debt have changed the mindsets of local officials, analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note on Monday. Generating strong economic growth no longer seems to have its former priority.
With the economy suffering from virus outbreaks and facing such headwinds as uncertain future market effects of the Ukraine conflict, the government has pledged a slew of policies aimed at supporting small firms.
The finance ministry said on March 24 that some small firms would be exempted from paying the 3% value-added tax, because they are the country's main source of jobs.

The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its sibling survey for the services sector, will be released on Thursday.
The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on Friday. Analysts expect its headline reading will edge down to 50 from 50.4 the previous month.

133,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 09:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s retail sales fell for a third straight month in February amid the country’s biggest wave of virus infections adding to concern that the economy’s recovery may have slipped back into reverse.
Sales fell 0.8% in February from the month before, as shoppers cut back spending on clothes and accessories, the economy ministry reported Wednesday. Analysts had expected a 0.3% decline. Compared with the previous year, sales were down for the first time since September, also falling 0.8%.  
In a month when Japan saw new daily case numbers top 100,000 and restaurants and bars were asked to close early under quasi-emergency restrictions, consumers likely took on a more cautious stance. The last time sales fell in three straight months was at the height of the first wave of the pandemic in spring 2020.
The negative results supports the view that the world’s third largest economy stalled or contracted in the first quarter as consumption cratered. Most analysts said they expect Japan’s economy to shrink this quarter in a Bloomberg survey this month, as the omicron curbs and higher energy prices fueled partly by the war in Ukraine hit consumers. 
“Quasi-emergency restrictions cooled consumer sentiment. People are seeing their disposable incomes being cut with food and gasoline prices rising,” said Hiroaki Muto, economist at Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. He still sees the economy narrowly avoiding a contraction, though he warns that consumption will remain weak with wage growth still muted.
To aid consumers hit by rising energy costs fueled by the war and a weakening yen, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida ordered measures to cushion the blow to consumers and businesses on Tuesday. 
The response is also likely an attempt to keep public support buoyant ahead of a summer election and to ensure that a hoped-for rebound in consumer spending occurs after the lifting of restrictions earlier this month.
A subsidy program that attempts to cap gasoline prices at the pump was also extended through the end of April, according to trade minister Koichi Hagiuda.

“The new economic measures seem to focus on easing the pain for households rather than stimulating demand, which would accelerate inflation further,” Muto said. “So I see it is more for the elections than for the economy.”
If the weaker yen persists, driving already elevated import costs even higher, Kishida may be forced to take more steps to keep voters happy. 
Anecdotally, a broad range of companies is already raising prices on products, as businesses face input costs that are increasing at the fastest pace in four decades.
The need to take action rests largely with the government since the Bank of Japan remains committed to keeping its monetary stimulus in place, a factor that has helped drive the yen to its lowest level against the dollar since 2015. 
Following the BOJ’s monetary policy meeting earlier this month, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda stuck to his position that the weaker yen remains a positive overall.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence rebounded from a one-year low in March amid growing labor market optimism, but rising interest rates as the Federal Reserve battles raging inflation could hurt motor vehicle purchases and crimp consumer spending.
The labor market continues to favor workers, with other data on Tuesday showing job openings hovering near record highs in February. Tightening labor market conditions are boosting wages, providing some cushion against inflation. Consumers' one-year inflation expectations shot up to an all-time high of 7.9%.
""A strong job market is helping households shoulder the worsening burden of rising prices,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte. ""One of the few things still supportive of consumer confidence is the fact that the labor market remains exceptionally tight."" 
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index rose to a reading of 107.2 this month from a downwardly revised 105.7 in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 107.0 from February's initially reported 110.5.
The improvement in confidence followed the rolling back of COVID-19 restrictions across the country, and was despite gasoline prices remaining above $4.00 per gallon as Russia's war against Ukraine rages on.
Unlike the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, which fell to an 11-year low in March, the Conference Board survey puts more emphasis on the labor market.
The Conference Board's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, increased to a record high 47.4 this month from a reading of 41.5 in February. 
This measure correlates to the unemployment rate from the Labor Department. The jobless rate was at a two-year low of 3.8% in February.

Consumers' upbeat views of the labor market were underscored by the Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report showing job openings, a measure of labor demand, fell 17,000 to 11.266 million on the last day of February. Despite the second straight monthly decline, job openings were not too far from a record high of 11.448 million set in December. Economists had forecast 11 million vacancies.
Job openings in the finance and insurance sector fell by 63,000 and decreased 39,000 in the nondurable goods manufacturing industry. But vacancies rose by 32,000 in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector, while education services reported 26,000 additional openings.
The job openings rate was unchanged at 7.0%. Hiring increased 263,000 to 6.689 million, led by construction, but fell in the information sector. The hires rate climbed to 4.4% from 4.3% in January.

The jobs-workers gap is now at 3.0% of the labor force, which economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said ""suggests strong wage growth will persist until improvements in labor supply and normalization of job openings bring the labor market back into balance."" There were a record 1.8 open jobs per unemployed person in February.
More people voluntarily quit their jobs, pushing the total to 4.352 million from 4.258 million in January, another sign of labor market confidence. About 74,000 retail workers quit, while durable goods manufacturing saw 22,000 resignations. The quits rate rose to 2.9% from 2.8% in January.
U.S. stocks were trading higher amid signs of progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. The widely tracked U.S. two-year/10-year Treasury yield curve inched closer to inversion, a signpost of recession, as traders bet that aggressive policy tightening by the Fed could hurt the economy over the longer term.
INFLATION EXPECTATIONS SOAR 
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months accelerated to 7.9%, the highest since the series started in 1987, from 7.1% in February. With inflation expectations surging, fewer consumers planned to buy cars over the next six months. But intentions to buy big-ticket items like refrigerators and washing machines increased. 
Plans to buy a house were unchanged, remaining below January's high reading as rising mortgage rates, combined with soaring prices, make home purchasing unaffordable, especially for first-time buyers. Still, demand for housing remains underpinned by the strong labor market.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is well above 4%. The Fed this month increased its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the U.S. central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to raise rates and possibly ""more aggressively"" to keep high inflation from becoming entrenched. 
House prices continue to march higher as builders struggle to bridge the supply gap because of shortages and higher prices for inputs like softwood lumber for framing, as well as cabinets, garage doors, countertops and appliances.
A third report showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller's 20 metropolitan area home price index increased 19.1% on a year-on-year basis in January after rising 18.6% in December. Cities like Miami, San Diego, Las Vegas, Denver, Los Angeles and San Francisco scored hefty increases.

Strong house price inflation was reinforced by a fourth report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency showing home prices accelerated 18.2% in the 12 months through January after advancing 17.7% in December. Annual price growth in excess of 20% was recorded in the Mountain, Pacific, South Atlantic and East South Central regions.
""We expect house prices will continue on their upward trajectory in coming quarters, although growth will slow from its rapid pace experienced over the past year and a half,"" said Brent Campbell, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

The large downward revision to February put that reading at the lowest in a year. Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, an event that triggered a global surge in oil prices, which sent U.S. gasoline prices to a record high earlier this month.

PARIS (Reuters) -France and Germany saw bigger than expected drops in consumer confidence this month as rising inflation and concern about the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine took their toll, surveys showed on Tuesday.
The European Central Bank insists the euro zone can avoid recession, but the collapse in consumer morale in its two top economies is a setback. Italy, the third largest economy, is due to downgrade its growth targets, sources in Rome said.
In Germany, the GfK institute said its consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 people, dropped to -15.5 points heading into April from a revised -8.5 points a month earlier and the lowest since February 2021.
""In February, hopes were still high that consumer sentiment would recover with the easing of pandemic-related restrictions. However, the war in Ukraine caused these hopes to vanish into thin air,"" GfK consumer expert Rolf Buerkl said in a statement.
Economists polled by Reuters had on average expected the index to drop to -14.0.
In France, the INSEE official statistics agency said its consumer confidence index fell to 91 points from 97 in February, falling short of economists' expectations in a Reuters poll for 94 and the worst headline figure since February 2021.
""A fall of that extent is rare,"" BNP analysts commented in a note that observed that sharper monthly drops had only previously occurred around the 1993 recession and the 2020 lockdown.
NO PRE-ELECTION BOUNCE
The result also ran counter to the improving trend usually seen ahead of presidential elections when optimism rises that a new political order will translate into improved standards of living.
Ahead of next month's French election, the government has put together a package of measures worth 25 billion euros ($27 billion) to reduce the pain of high energy prices and inflation.
But that did little to ease inflation fears with the proportion of households expecting inflation to increase jumping by 50 points to its highest since INSEE's survey began in 1972.
As part of the government measures, France has capped increases in gas and power prices, made one-off anti-inflation payouts to low-income households and offered a rebate on fuel prices.
In Germany, the ruling coalition agreed last week on a second package of measures in as many months to give people relief from soaring power, heating and fuel costs.
Under the 17 billion euro package, German workers and families will receive extra public cash, a tax cut on petrol and cut-price public transport tickets.
Separately, the trade union-linked IMK institute forecast Germany's economy would grow more slowly than expected and could even contract this year due to the war in Ukraine. 
Its analysts predicted a base scenario of 2.1% growth - less than half the 4.5% they saw for 2022 back in December - but said a worst-case scenario including much higher energy prices could even see a 0.3% contraction.
The deteriorating consumer confidence is not limited to France and Germany.
Based on a flash estimate last Wednesday, euro zone sentiment collapsed in March to 18.7 points, the lowest level since the start of the COVID-19 crisis in April and May 2020.
Italy, the euro zone's third-largest economy, also saw a bigger than expected decline in consumer confidence, the national statistics office said last week.
On Tuesday sources close to the matter told Reuters that Mario Draghi's government is preparing next week to slash its 2022 growth forecast to 2.8% from a previous 4.7% goal set in September due to surging energy costs and turmoil linked to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The Ukraine war also caused the steepest decline in Belgian consumer confidence since records began in 1985, while Dutch consumer morale dropped to its lowest level in nine years in March.

Economists polled by Reuters this month expect the euro zone to grow 3.8% this year and 2.5% next, marginally down from 3.9% and 2.5% predicted last month.

A measure of prices in 20 U.S. cities jumped 19.1%, up from 18.6% the previous month, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index showed Tuesday. 
Phoenix, Tampa and Miami reported the biggest year-over-year gains.
Price increases peaked in July and have cooled off slightly in recent months. Still, demand for homes remains strong two years after the pandemic hit the U.S., with bidding wars and cash offers common in hot markets. 
A lack of properties to buy has combined with rising mortgage rates to keep some potential buyers on the sidelines, particularly renters trying to crack into the market. Pending home sales dropped unexpectedly in February, posting a fourth straight monthly decline as the inventory shortage restricts sales.

The INSEE official stats agency said its consumer confidence index fell to 91 points from 97 in February, plunging steeply in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The result, the lowest since February 2021, fell short of economists' forecasts for 94 points on average in a Reuters poll and flew in the face of a improving trend observed ahead of previous presidential elections. France has a presidential election next month. 

The share of households expecting inflation to increase over the coming year jumped 50 points to the highest level since the survey began in 1972, INSEE said.
With the election looming next month, the government has budgeted more than 25 billion euros ($27 billion) in measures to cap gas and power prices, make inflation offsetting handouts to low-income households and offer a rebate on fuel prices.

The GfK institute said its consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, tumbled to -15.5 points heading into April from a revised -8.5 points a month earlier, the lowest since February 2021.
Analysts polled by Reuters had on average expected the index to drop to -14.0.
""In February, hopes were still high that consumer sentiment would recover with the easing of pandemic-related restrictions. However, the war in Ukraine caused these hopes to vanish into thin air,"" GfK consumer expert Rolf Buerkl said in a statement.
Energy prices have suffered the most from rising uncertainty and sanctions against Russia, Buerkl said, adding that longer-term recovery of German consumer morale would only be possible in case of a rapid ceasefire followed by peace negotiations.
""Domestic economy would then significantly contribute to overall economic development again as a result of declining uncertainty, and the easing of pandemic-related restrictions would also be able to have its positive effect,"" he said.
The survey took place from March 3 to March 14, after Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 and started the largest war in Europe since World War Two.

Shenzhen's recent ""war"" on COVID-19 has hurt up to 93% of the local small and medium-sized companies surveyed by the state-controlled newspaper, with many suffering production disruptions due to shutdowns, interruptions in supply chains, and delays in order executions. 
Shenzhen allowed businesses and factories to restart operations on March 21 after authorities declared the latest outbreak had been brought under control.
The city, which has grappled with multiple outbreaks so far this year, conducted three rounds of mass testing in March after a spike in infections.
The outbreaks were modest by international standards, but Shenzhen authorities were swift to implement measures including business shutdowns under China's so-called ""dynamic"" zero-COVID policy.
In the Securities Times survey, 93% of the 97 companies that responded said the epidemic had raised their operating expenses, including labour, logistics and raw materials costs. 
About half of them had 100 to 500 employees, while 26% commanded a labour force of over 500. 
Compounding their woes, they said, has been difficulty in accessing financing. 
More worrying than the short-term effect of the shutdowns is the long-term contraction in demand caused by the epidemic, the newspaper warned, citing a ""profound"" impact on Chinese demand from COVID-19. 
Companies complained about changes in consumer behaviour from delays in surgical operations to purchases of new mobile phones. 
Data on China's factory and services sector for March due out in coming days are expected to reflect the COVID-related pain. 
The epicentre of China's COVID containment efforts has since moved to Shanghai, where the megacity of 26 million residents is facing its worst flare-up since China's initial 2020 outbreak. 
Beijing has vowed to stabilise economic growth in a year when President Xi Jinping is expected in the autumn to secure a third term as leader in a once-in-five-years congress of the ruling Communist Party. 

""Although Beijing on some occasions has also called to minimise the economic cost of (its zero-COVID strategy), local government officials in practice have been ratcheting up mandatory mass testing and social distancing measures in fear of being accused of dereliction of duty,"" Nomura said. 
""The consequence is that China's economy faces the most severe pressure since the spring of 2020.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retail sales beat forecasts again in February as shoppers defied storms and coronavirus waves to return to cafes and department stores for the second-best month ever of spending.
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Tuesday showed retail sales climbed 1.8% in February from the previous month to A$33.1 billion ($24.76 billion), handily beating forecasts of a 1.0% gain.
That left sales up a huge 9.1% on February last year and followed a surprisingly upbeat 1.6% gain in January, suggesting household spending overall was set for a strong first quarter.
""Most discretionary spending industries experienced strong rises once again as consumer cautiousness lessened, leading to an increase in mobility and improved business conditions,"" said Ben James, an ABS director of statistics.
Cafes and restaurants saw gains of 9.7% in February, from the previous month, while the department store and clothing sectors both climbed more than 11%.
The splurge looks to have continued with the latest card data from Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) (CBA) showing further gains in the two weeks to March 25 as flooding on the east coast caused only a brief dip.
""Spending on recreation continued its recent strength with clothing and footwear and dining out also strengthening in the fortnight,"" said CBA economist Harry Ottley. ""Spending on transport remained elevated, reflecting high petrol prices.""
The record cost of petrol has been punishing for consumer sentiment, however, with ANZ Bank's weekly survey showing the mood on personal finances was the worst since the depths of the pandemic in mid-2020.
The rising cost of living has become a hot political issue ahead of an election expected in May and the government will try to use its budget later on Tuesday to appease voters with cash handouts and temporary cuts to fuel taxes.
The ANZ survey also showed consumer inflation expectations surging to decade highs, a headache for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which is weighing when to start raising interest rates from all-time lows of 0.1%.
The central bank has said it would be patient in the hope wages would pick up, and a hike was likely later in the year. 

Markets are wagering it will have to act much more aggressively to head off inflation and have a rise to 0.25% priced in by June, and then a string of hikes to at least 1.75% by year end.

(Reuters) -U.S. new vehicle sales could fall to the lowest first-quarter volume in the past decade as chip shortages and the Ukraine crisis squeeze inventories and rising prices push less affluent buyers out of the market, research firm Cox Automotive said Monday. 
U.S. car and light truck sales are expected to fall more than 24% to about 1.22 million units in March and decline more than 16% in the first quarter. 
""Make no mistake, this market is stuck in low gear,"" said Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist at Cox Automotive, adding that sales will remain at current levels until supply improves.
Cox forecasters said the U.S. economy should not experience a recession. But Cox cut its forecast for U.S. car and light truck sales in all of 2022 to 15.3 million vehicles, down 700,000 vehicles from its January outlook. And even hitting the new target will require significant improvement in supply chain disruptions, Cox said.
Fresh lockdowns in China as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine have reignited supply bottlenecks that were easing over recent months. Tight supplies have pushed new vehicle prices to record high levels.
Detroit's mainstream brands and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Corp are getting hurt as less affluent consumers leave the new vehicle market, Cox analysts said during a call. 
Households with less than $75,000 in annual income now account for nearly two percentage points less of the U.S. light vehicle market than a year ago, Chesbrough said. The average income of a new vehicle buyer is now $124,000.

Detroit mainstream brands such as Chevrolet are losing market share, while Cox predicted Japan's Toyota could be the top selling automaker in the U.S. market for the first quarter.
""Long-term, you are shrinking the pool of people who are likely to buy"" a new vehicle, said Cox Chief Economist Jonathan Smoke.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit in goods narrowed in February, but the fall reversed only a fraction of the surge to a record high in January, suggesting that trade would again weigh on economic growth in the first quarter.
Though the advance indicators report from the Commerce Department on Monday showed businesses continuing to restock last month, the pace slowed from late 2021, implying that there would probably be no contribution to gross domestic product growth from inventory investment either.
""We think trade might subtract about two-three percentage points from GDP growth in the first quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""While it looks likely to us that the real change in inventories will be strong again, it may end up comparable to the large increase reported for the fourth quarter and therefore inventories could be fairly close to a neutral factor for GDP growth in first quarter."" 
The trade deficit last month fell 0.9% to $106.6 billion, the Commerce Department said on Monday. The goods trade deficit hit an all-time high of $107.6 billion in January.
Exports increased 1.2% to $157.2 billion. Economists believe exports, which were not adjusted for inflation, were flattered by higher prices rather than increased volumes. A blockade of U.S-Canada border crossings by Canadian truck drivers last month likely reduced export volumes. 
The government will publish February's comprehensive trade report, which will include country data, next Tuesday. 
Last month's rise in goods exports was led by a 6.3% surge in shipments of consumer goods. Food exports accelerated 3.6%, while industrial supplies increased 2.6%. But motor vehicle exports dropped 3.4% as production continued to be hampered by a global semiconductor shortage. There were also substantial declines in exports of capital goods and other goods.
IMPORT GROWTH MODERATES
Imports of goods gained 0.3% to $263.7 billion. They were curbed by a 9.9% decline in imports of motor vehicles as well as a 3.0% drop in food imports. But there were strong increases in imports of industrial supplies and other goods. 
Capital goods imports also rose as did consumer goods, pointing to strong business and consumer spending. Trade has subtracted from gross domestic product growth for six straight quarters. A shift in spending from services to goods during the COVID-19 pandemic led to a boom in imports as domestic manufacturers struggled with snarled supply chains.
A resurgence in coronavirus infections in China and Russia's war against Ukraine could worsen supply constraints.
""The strong economic recovery in the U.S. from the pandemic has supported imports while a relatively slower global economic recovery has weighed on exports,"" said Abbey Omodunbi, a senior economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
""The goods trade outlook is cloudy. New lockdowns in Shanghai and increased uncertainties from the Russia-Ukraine crisis will weigh on U.S. exports.""
Businesses continued to replenish inventories in February, though the pace was less frantic than towards the end of last year. Wholesale stocks increased 2.1% after climbing 1.1% in January. Retail inventories rose 1.1% in February following a 1.9% advance in January. 
Motor vehicle inventories gained 0.9% after surging 2.5% in January. Excluding motor vehicles, retail inventories increased 1.2% after accelerating 1.7% in January. This component goes into the calculation of GDP growth. 
Inventory investment accelerated at a robust seasonally adjusted annualized rate of $171.2 billion in the fourth quarter, contributing 4.90 percentage points to the quarter's 7.0% growth pace. 
Despite February's solid rise, inventories are likely to be neutral to GDP growth this quarter as they would need to increase at a faster rate than in the fourth quarter to contribute to growth. First-quarter GDP growth estimates are mostly below a 1.0% pace. 

Some economists believe the pace of inventory investment is sufficient to contribute to GDP growth this year. 
""These strong levels are broadly consistent with our view that inventory investment will provide solid support for GDP this year, with inventories remaining very low in relation to sales after having been pared in earlier stages of the pandemic,"" said Jonathan Millar, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York.

145,"<span>Mar 27, 2022 08:40PM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) -Profit growth at China's industrial firms accelerated in January-February in line with other signs of momentum in the economy, although the outlook clouded by COVID-19 outbreaks and the war in Ukraine is stoking calls for supportive measures.
Profits rose 5.0% in from a year earlier, up from a 4.2% gain in December, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Sunday.
The growth in January-February was driven by surging profits in the energy and raw materials sectors, thanks to higher prices of commodities such as crude oil and coal. January and February data are typically combined to smooth out distortions from the Lunar New Year holiday, which can fall in either month. 
Downstream, monthly profit growth among other industrial firms has been weighed down by high raw material costs, languishing in the single-digits since November.
The slightly faster industrial profit growth was in step with improvement in NBS data on industrial output, retail sales and fixed-asset investment in January-February, suggesting the impact of recent policy measures were starting to be felt. 
Still, challenges have emerged this year including China's most serious COVID outbreak since early in the pandemic in 2020, driven by the Omicron variant, threatening to disrupt local economies and further chill consumer spending. 
""The gap between upstream and downstream profit margins widened as downstream profit margins fell further,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts wrote in a note. 
""We expect the COVID outbreak in multiple provinces to weigh on industrial profits in the near term.""
Given the coronavirus flare-ups, policies to further ease monetary and fiscal measures can be expected, they said. 
The financial hub of Shanghai has been battling with its worst COVID spell in the past month since the initial outbreak in China two years ago.
UKRAINE 
Global upheavals such as Russia's attack on Ukraine have also created uncertainty over international supply chains and the potential for even higher commodity and energy prices, ultimately weighing on the bottom line of Chinese firms.
""The countries in conflict are important exporters of energy and agricultural products, and comprehensive sanctions on Russia may have a huge negative impact on global supply chains,"" according to an opinion piece in state-controlled China Daily on Monday. 
""As the current positive manner of economic performance is hard-won and potential risks still exist, China should launch expansionary policies as soon as possible to protect incipient recovery.""
Vice Premier Liu He said recently that Beijing will take measures to boost the economy in the first quarter and that monetary policy would be set to support growth.
To ease financial burdens for smaller firms, China has pledged around 1.5 trillion yuan ($240 billion) in value-added tax (VAT) rebates.
The finance ministry said on Thursday China will exempt the 3% VAT levied on some small firms, the country's main source of jobs.

The statistics bureau's industrial profits data cover large firms with annual revenues above 20 million yuan from their main operations.

The Ifo institute said its business climate index dropped to 90.8 in March from a downwardly revised 98.5 in February. A Reuters poll of analysts had pointed to a March reading of 94.2.
""The message from Germany's most important economic barometer is clear: the German economy is very likely to slide into recession,"" said Thomas Gitzel, chief economist at VP Bank Group.
The publication of the purchasing managers' index on Thursday gave some hope the German economy had so far been able to absorb the economic consequences of the war, but Friday's Ifo index ""teaches us otherwise,"" Gitzel said.
""The extreme divergence between the situation and expectations is typical. Even if not much has actually happened, uncertainty due to the war is very high,"" said Jens-Oliver Niklasch, senior economist at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg.
Ultimately, the uncertainty goes far beyond the Ukraine war, raising questions about the sustainability of Germany's business model, said Andreas Scheuerle at Decabank, pointing to the one-sided dependence of Europe's largest economy on supplier and customer countries.
According to Commerzbank (DE:CBKG)'s Joerg Kraemer, companies are particularly afraid of such risks as a Western boycott of Russian oil, which would lead leave the market considerably undersupplied and catapult the prices upwards.
The index for business expectations also fell to 85.1 from 98.4, the sharpest plunge since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
At the moment, two-thirds of industrial companies want to raise their prices more than ever before and retailers are also looking to follow suit, Ifo economic expert Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters.
""This is a domino effect,"" he said.

The service sector can initially rejoice at the easing of COVID-19 curbs, but trouble is looming on the horizon as filling up the car tank has become a burden and families will have to cut down on leisure activities, Gitzel said.
At the same time, the relief package announced by the German government on Thursday is nowhere near enough to compensate for the increased costs, Gitzel said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Contracts to buy U.S. previously owned homes dropped to the lowest level in nearly two years in February, weighed down by a persistent shortage of properties, and activity could remain sluggish amid increasing mortgage rates and high house prices.
The National Association of Realtors (NAR) said on Friday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on signed contracts, fell 4.1% last month to 104.9, the lowest level since May 2020. It was the fourth straight monthly decline in the index, which leads sales by a month or two. 
Pending home sales declined in the South, Midwest and West, but rose in the Northeast. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast contracts rebounding 1.0%. Pending home sales decreased 5.4% in February on a year-on-year basis.
""A lack of supply that is showing few signs of easing is boosting prices and impacting affordability,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""Further increases in mortgage rates as the Fed hikes and starts balance sheet reduction will be an additional constraint for sales going forward.""
Sales of previously owned homes tumbled in February, but remained above their pre-pandemic level. The inventory of used houses is at record lows. Shortages and expensive building materials have made it harder for builders to ramp up construction, leading to double-digit growth in houses prices. 
Mortgage rates surged in February and have continued to push higher after the Federal Reserve last week raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years. They are likely to continue accelerating as Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Monday said the U.S. central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to raise rates and possibly ""more aggressively"" to keep high inflation from becoming entrenched.
The 30-year fixed rate averaged 4.42% this week, the highest since January 2019, from 4.16% in the prior week, data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC) showed on Thursday.
According to the NAR, higher mortgage rates and sustained house price inflation had resulted in a 28% year-over-year jump in mortgage payments as of February. 
U.S. stocks were mostly higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
GASOLINE PRICES STABILIZING 
Other data on Friday confirmed that consumer sentiment wobbled in March as gasoline prices surged to a record high in the wake of Russia's war against Ukraine, lifting one-year inflation expectations to the highest level since 1981. 
The University of Michigan's final consumer sentiment index dropped to 59.4 in March, the lowest reading since August 2011. It was slightly revised down from the preliminary reading of 59.7 earlier in the month. The index was at 62.8 in February and it has now declined for three straight months.
Some economists viewed the modest revision from early this month as a sign that the worst was over and than ebb in sentiment could be coming to an end.
The survey places more emphasis on gasoline prices and the stock market. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index, which puts more weight on the labor market, remains well above its COVID-19 pandemic lows. 
Gasoline prices appear to be stabilizing after setting a record high of $4.331 per gallon on March 11. Prices averaged $4.243 per gallon on Friday, according to AAA.
Economists maintained that the continued slump in the University of Michigan's sentiment index was overdone relative to fundamentals and they expected the economy to continue growing. First-time applications for unemployment benefits are at a 52-1/2-year low and wages are rising at a strong clip.
There were 11.3 million job openings at the end of January. Consumers have accumulated more than $2 trillion in excess savings, which should help to cushion the blow from high inflation. The share of consumers planning to buy motor vehicles increased compared to February, while intentions to purchase major household items rose modestly. Home buying plans fell.

""The continuing weakness in confidence does not warrant any immediate change to our near-term forecast for consumer spending as the relationship between spending and sentiment is loose,"" said Scott Hoyt, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
Consumers' inflation expectations were unchanged from earlier this month. The survey's one-year inflation expectations jumped to 5.4%, the highest since November 1981, from 4.9% in February. Its five-year inflation expectations held steady at 3.0% for a second straight month.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Inflation in Brazil grew more than expected in the month to mid-March, the biggest jump for that period in seven years, data showed on Friday, underscoring across-the-board price pressures despite aggressive monetary tightening led by the central bank. 
Brazil's official IPCA-15 consumer price index rose 0.95% in the month, down from 0.99% in February but above the median forecast in a Reuters poll of a 0.87% increase.
According to IBGE statistics agency, all nine groups of products and services surveyed recorded higher prices, especially food and beverages, which rose 1.95% over the previous month.
Inflation in the 12 months to mid-March climbed to 10.79%, also above the 10.69% projection in the poll. 
That is far from the central bank's year-end target of 3.5%, reflecting an already complex domestic inflationary dynamic that was further impacted by the surge in commodity prices after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Brazil's central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto said inflation should peak in April, stressing that the short-term figure will be a ""little higher"" than previously expected by policymakers.
Earlier this month, the central bank raised the country's benchmark interest rate by 100 basis points to 11.75%, from a record-low of 2 last March, and signaled another hike of the same size in May. That could wrap up a rate hike cycle that should weigh on the economy this year.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto realtor Nasma Ali has noted a marked slowdown in housing demand in the red-hot Greater Toronto Area over the past few weeks, which she sees as a likely precursor to a reckoning in the suburbs and surrounding towns that have seen blistering price growth over the past two years. 
""I had listings that, in January, would have had a 100+ showings,"" Ali, chief executive of broker One Group, said. ""All of a sudden, we're only getting five to six in four days. This is a transition period and it's not for all markets or price points. But we're seeing it."" 
Already, homes listed for sale in supply-constrained Toronto have fallen at a slower pace than sales in February from a year earlier, compared with most of last year when listings lagged sales.
The slowdown in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver and their surrounding areas appears to be gathering steam, driven by a confluence of factors.

Worsening housing affordability, rising fixed and variable mortgage rates, and accelerating inflation following Russia's invasion of Ukraine is shifting sentiment.
Record-low mortgage rates helped propel Canadian home prices 52% higher over the past two years. But as fixed mortgage rates rip higher alongside surging bond yields and variable rates climb following the Bank of Canada's first hike in three years, demand is cooling. 
Money markets are betting the central bank will increase its policy rate to 2.25% by year-end, up from a current 0.5%. [BOCWATCH]
""This is the most dramatic increase in five-year fixed rates that I can remember, and I've been in this business for two decades,"" said David Larock, a mortgage agent at Integrated Mortgage Planners. ""I'm starting to see purchase and sale agreements come in with financing conditions, which has been unheard of in the last couple of years,"" he said.
Marnie Bennett, owner of Bennett Property Shop Realty in Ottawa, said she has seen a shift in the market, particularly at the lower end, as affordability concerns dissuade first-time buyers, and investors cash out near the peak. 
""It's only because interest rates are so low that there's any affordability left,"" said BMO Capital Markets Senior Economist Sal Guatieri. ""But that affordability will erode pretty quickly,"" he said, adding the central bank's rate hikes ""will douse the flames somewhat.""
While that is unlikely to cause major damage to household finances, it will put pressure on marginal buyers, he said.
Pedro Antunes, chief economist at the Conference Board of Canada, expects a decline of about 10% in home prices from peak to trough, driven by the end of pandemic income supports, rising interest rates and the return to more normal consumer spending patterns. 
""People are going to start taking their vacation trips south and perhaps not be ready to put quite as much into a new mortgage,"" he said.
Despite the softness, both Toronto and Vancouver have seen price growth of 27% and 20% respectively from a year ago. Prices are up 20.6%, on average, nationwide.

""It's still a seller's market,"" said Toronto realtor Lisa Bednarski at BSpoke Realty. ""But what we're going to stop seeing are the homes that sell for inexplicable amounts above their market values.""

Fuelled by a strong post-pandemic recovery, industrial prices had been soaring in Spain even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine exerted additional pressure on power costs. 
Prices rose 40.7% in February, the highest level since the data series began in January 1976, led by a 114.4% increase in energy costs compared with the same month last year.
Capital goods rose 4.6%, boosted by increased costs facing carmakers, INE said.

Companies tend to pass on industrial price rises to customers, fuelling inflation. In recent months, energy prices and inflation have soared in European countries, with Spanish inflation is running at its fastest pace in 35 years.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing economic fallout has dented hopes that price rises will ease any time soon and the European Union's southern countries, including Spain, have called for the bloc to adopt common energy policies to face the situation.

Retail sales volumes unexpectedly fell by 0.3% in February from January. Economists polled by Reuters had on average forecast a 0.6% monthly rise. 
Excluding automotive fuel, which rose in price in February as tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated, sales volumes fell by a sharper 0.7%.
Some of the fall was linked by the Office for National Statistics to stormy weather which kept some shoppers at home while the fading of the Omicron COVID-19 meant people returned to pubs and restaurants at expense of grocery retailers. 
But rising prices meant the amount of money spent on food shopping rose, even as volumes fell.
Analysts said the data - combined with a drop in polling firm GfK's measure of consumer confidence in March to levels last seen in November 2020 - was a taste of things to come as inflation climbs higher.
GfK's gauge of personal finances for the coming year slumped to a joint record low, matched only by the reading in July 2008 when the global financial crisis was reaching a climax.
Inflation hit a 30-year high of 6.2% in February and the government's budget watchdog this week forecast it will go close to 9% in late 2022, contributing to the biggest fall in living standards since at least the 1950s.
""Against that backdrop, it seems all but inevitable that households will continue to pare back spending in the coming month,"" Bethany Beckett, an economist with Capital Economics, said. 
Finance minister Rishi Sunak announced tax cuts this week that he said would help to ease the squeeze on households, but analysts said his plan did little to help those on lowest incomes.
There were some bright spots for retailers.
The easing of the coronavirus crisis, and the subsequent increase in people socialising and returning to workplaces, led to a 13% leap in clothing sales in February from January.
The share of online sales in value terms was its lowest since March 2020 at 27.8% but overall sales were 3.7% above their pre-coronavirus levels of February 2020.

Volumes of fuel bought surpassed their pre-pandemic levels for the first time, although the amount of money spent on fuel grew more quickly, reflecting the higher prices.
Compared with a year earlier, overall sales volumes were up by 7.0%, short of the 7.8% growth expected in the Reuters poll.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Core consumer prices in Japan's capital rose at the fastest pace in more than two years in March, propelled by energy costs that have hit a four-decade high following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The relentless uptrend in global commodity prices could ruin Japan's fragile recovery from the pandemic, even as domestic COVID-19 infections wane and social distancing curbs are reduced, analysts say.
The Tokyo core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food but includes energy items, rose 0.8% year-on-year in March, the fastest pace since December 2019. It was also quicker than a median market forecast for a 0.7% gain and the 0.5% rise in February.
""While Japan's recovery from the pandemic remains slow, reopening Western economies have propped up global inflation before Japan could reopen its economy,"" said Toru Suehiro, senior economist at Daiwa Securities.
""Now prices are rising further on the Ukraine (war), which is such an ill-timed curb on consumption for Japanese economy.""
The inflation measure in Japan's capital is considered a leading indicator of the nationwide core CPI that is released around a month later.
A 26.1% surge in energy prices - the fastest annual growth in 41 years - drove up the Tokyo core CPI for March, the data showed.
However, gasoline price inflation has slowed from February thanks to fuel subsidies the government expanded earlier this month.
Prices also increased among a wide range of items from wheat-based food to entertainment services.
In the overall reading that includes fresh food prices, Tokyo CPI in March rose 1.3% from a year earlier, hitting the highest since April 2019.
But the one-off effect of cuts in cellphone fees stripped 1.08 points off the overall index, it showed.
Even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Japan's central bank had expected core inflation to approach its elusive 2% target, according to the minutes of their January meeting released on Thursday.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is set to instruct his cabinet next week to draw up new relief, such as fuel subsidies and other measures for households.
In April, part of the special mobile fee effect disappears, but the government's expected extension of fuel subsidies may prevent Japan's core CPI reading from flaring up much higher than 2%, Daiwa's Suehiro said.

Cost hikes driven by the Ukraine conflict will take roughly six months to reach consumer electricity and gas bills, so the inflationary blow to Japanese households will culminate later this year, Suehiro said.
""I expect an around 2% (core) inflation to continue until the end of 2022,"" he said. ""Economic growth in April-June will still be solid thanks to a rebound in service spending...but I'm worried about July-September and later.""
 
"
153,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 08:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The cost of living in Tokyo increased by the biggest margin in more than two years this month as the impact of surging oil prices prompted another acceleration of inflation.
Consumer prices excluding fresh food climbed 0.8% in the capital in March from a year earlier, according to the ministry of internal affairs Friday. Economists had expected an increase of 0.7%. Price moves in Tokyo are a leading indicator for national inflation. 
Even with the acceleration, inflation in Tokyo still remains well below the Bank of Japan’s 2% target and is unlikely to nudge Governor Haruhiko Kuroda to follow his global peers in tightening policy for now.
The governor said last week that Japan’s inflation dynamics are very different from Europe and the U.S. and insisted there was no need to follow the rate hikes of global peers including the Federal Reserve that are looking to cool price growth.
With monetary stimulus set to remain in place, attention is shifting to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and what he might do to minimize the economic pain of higher energy prices among businesses and households before elections this summer.
The March figures showed energy prices rose 26% from a year earlier, boosting overall prices by 1.2 percentage point, cushioning the temporary drag from cell phone fee cuts. The ongoing war in Ukraine is set to keep oil prices volatile.
Japan’s nationwide inflation is expected to pick up further speed as the yen continues to weaken, a factor that will increase import prices. The impact of sharp mobile fee reductions last year will start to drop off from April when economists expect a jump in price readings. 
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) Japan joined the growing list of businesses raising prices this week. It will raise bean prices for the first time in 16 years on the cost of higher raw materials, according to a statement. 
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“We expect Tokyo’s inflation to accelerate to 2% in April on higher prices of energy and imported food, inflated by a drop in the yen.”

While quasi-emergency measures for the pandemic were lifted from all regions this week, policy makers are closely looking at how rising energy prices might keep a lid on pent-up demand and the purchasing power of households known for their entrenched deflationary mindset. 
About 85% of respondents in a survey by Jiji said price increases in gasoline and daily necessities are affecting their standard of living.
Local media reported this week that Kishida is going to call for measures next week to address the impact of higher energy prices and inflation.
The Sankei newspaper reported Tuesday that the government and ruling coalition are preparing to draw up a stimulus package worth more than 10 trillion yen ($82 billion).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits dropped to a 52-1/2-year low last week, while unemployment rolls continued to shrink, pointing to rapidly diminishing labor market slack that will keep boosting wage inflation.
The strength in the job market reported by the Labor Department on Thursday may push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by half a percentage point at its next policy meeting in May. Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Monday said the U.S. central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to raise rates and possibly ""more aggressively"" to keep high inflation from becoming entrenched.
The Fed last week increased its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years.
""U.S. businesses are not laying off workers because they know the enormous challenges they're facing in filling open positions,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
""If initial claims remain below 200,000 for a period of time, it will raise a red flag with the Fed.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 28,000 to a seasonally adjusted 187,000 for the week ended March 19, the lowest level since September 1969. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 212,000 applications for the latest week.
Last week's drop in claims was widespread, with large decreases in California, Michigan, Kentucky and Illinois. 
Claims have been declining in part as COVID-19 restrictions across the country have been lifted amid a massive drop in coronavirus cases. They have declined from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020. 
There are no signs that Russia's war against Ukraine, which has sent U.S. gasoline prices to record highs and is expected to worsen the strain on global supply chains, has impacted the labor market.
But supply bottlenecks are restraining business spending on equipment. A separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, slipped 0.3% last month after jumping 1.3% in January.
Economists had forecast these so-called core capital goods orders would rise 0.5%. 
Shipments of core capital goods gained 0.5% last month after increasing 2.1% in January. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the gross domestic product measurement. Economists still expect strong business investment in equipment this quarter.
""It is possible that the February declines represent a shift in businesses' intentions for capex, but the February figures also may just reflect noise in the monthly data,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""We think real equipment spending is on track for strong growth in the first quarter even with related price increases offsetting some of the nominal gains.""
U.S. stocks rebounded from a sharp drop on Wednesday. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries fell.
LABOR CRUNCH
Companies are desperate for workers. There were 11.3 million job openings at the end of January, with a record 1.8 open positions per unemployed person. 
This misalignment between demand for labor and supply is boosting wage growth, which is providing some cushion to households against the soaring gasoline prices, as well as feeding into high inflation. 
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 67,000 to 1.350 million during the week ended March 12, the lowest since January, 1970. The so-called continued claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed households for March's unemployment rate.

Continued claims declined sharply between the February and March survey periods. The unemployment rate fell to a two-year low of 3.8% in February.
""These data suggest that the March employment situation report is likely to be similar to recent reports, which have shown strong job growth and continuing declines in the unemployment rate,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.

S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) said on Thursday its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, rose to a reading of 58.5 this month. That was the highest reading since July 2021 and followed 55.9 in February.
A reading above 50 indicates growth in the private sector. The continued rebound from a slump in January mostly reflected pent-up demand and the easing of COVID-19 restrictions across the country amid a massive decline in coronavirus cases, as well as less severe supply chain disruptions.
The flash composite orders index rose to a nine-month high, with businesses reporting that ""a greater availability of inputs allowed them to be more competitive and win new customers."" 
With new orders and unfinished work piling up, companies hired workers at the sharpest pace since April 2021. 
Inflation continued to push higher, with companies reporting more price hikes for raw materials, fuel and energy. Prices are likely to remain elevated as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and lockdowns in China amid a COVID-19 outbreak slow the improvement in global supply chains.
Consumer prices notched their biggest annual rise in 40 years in February. 
Though businesses were broadly upbeat about the outlook this year, the degree of confidence suffered amid worries about the soaring input costs and the Russia-Ukraine war. According to S&P Global, businesses in the services sector were less upbeat, concerned about the impact of reduced disposable incomes as the cost of living rises.

The survey's flash manufacturing PMI jumped to a reading of 58.5 this month from 57.3 in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, slipping to 56.3. 
Its flash services sector PMI increased to a reading of 58.9 this month from 56.5 in February. Economists had forecast a reading of 56.0 this month for the services sector, which makes up more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.

156,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 08:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Applications for U.S. state unemployment insurance fell last week to the lowest since 1969 as demand for labor far exceeds supply and rampant inflation keeps the incentive to work high.
Initial unemployment claims decreased by 28,000 to 187,000 in the week ended March 19, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate called for 210,000 applications in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
Continuing claims for state benefits dropped to 1.35 million in the week ended March 12.
The drop in claims is consistent with a labor market in which employers are desperately trying to hang onto workers and attract new ones. Applications should stay low as the combination of dwindling savings and decades-high inflation is raising Americans’ financial incentive to work.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth was stronger than expected this month, a survey showed on Thursday, although prices rose at a record pace, likely adding to pressure on the European Central Bank to raise interest rates.
However, some of that expansion came from a rebound following the lifting of COVID restrictions and the outlook is murky as supply chain issues caused by the coronavirus pandemic have worsened following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI)'s Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good gauge of overall economic health, slipped to 54.5 in March from 55.5 in February although it was comfortably above the median 53.9 forecast in a Reuters poll.
Anything above 50 indicates growth.
""March's euro zone PMI survey is consistent with our view that the economy will grow more slowly than most anticipate this year, while inflation will overshoot expectations,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds at Capital Economics.
""The survey also showed that supply problems worsened, which firms linked to the war in Ukraine as well as delays from China following the latest COVID outbreak there.""
Activity in Germany, Europe's largest economy, dipped this month as output price inflation hit a new record high and the war in Ukraine impacted demand as well as supply chains, earlier data showed.
But French business activity accelerated unexpectedly to an eight-month high as easier COVID restrictions boosted the service sector and eclipsed concerns about the Ukraine crisis' impact on manufacturing.
In Britain, outside the common currency area, the private-sector services PMI hit its highest in nine months but manufacturing output was reported at its lowest in five months.
S&P Global said the reopening of the British economy after pandemic restrictions had helped offset the drag from the conflict in Ukraine, Brexit and rising prices.
OPTIMISM SLUMP
Both the euro zone composite input and output prices indexes were at their highest in the survey's history.
The output prices index jumped to 65.7 from 62.3 suggesting inflation, already a record 5.8% in February, has further to climb. The ECB would like it at 2%.
""Price pressure remains very high. Accordingly, consumers will have to expect prices to continue to rise in the coming months. This increases the pressure on the ECB to initiate a turnaround in monetary policy,"" said Christoph Weil at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
Earlier this month the ECB said it would stop pumping money into financial markets this summer, paving the way for an increase in interest rates.
A PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry fell to 54.8 this month from 55.5 but was ahead of the Reuters poll estimate for 54.2.
Demand was resilient and with more pandemic-related restrictions eased firms increased headcount at a faster rate. The services employment index rose to 54.8 from 53.6.
While factory activity remained solid the pace of growth slowed to its weakest since January last year. The manufacturing PMI dropped to 57.0 from 58.2 but was ahead of expectations for 56.0.

An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, sank to 53.6 from 55.5.
High inflation and concerns over Russia's invasion of Ukraine put a severe dent into optimism. The factory future output index plummeted to 53.8 from 68.5, its lowest reading since May 2020 - not long after the coronavirus pandemic began.

(Reuters) -Russia's National Wealth Fund (NWF), which accumulates the country's oil revenues, fell 11.5% month-on-month to $154.8 billion in February as the value of Russian companies it was invested in sagged, finance ministry data showed on Wednesday.
Unprecedented Western sanctions against Russia for what Moscow calls ""a special operation in Ukraine"" that began on Feb. 24 have caused a big fall in Russian stocks. 
The NWF, originally designed to help balance the pension system, stood at 9.7% of gross domestic product projected in 2022 as of March 1, down from 10.2% of projected GDP, or $174.9 billion, a month earlier.
The fund's liquid assets stood at $116.6 billion, or 7.3% of projected 2022 GDP as of March 1 compared with $112.7 billion, or 6.6% of projected GDP a month earlier, the ministry said.

The fund's investment in ordinary shares of Russia's No.1 lender Sberbank was worth an estimated 1.5 trillion roubles, down from 3 trillion roubles a month earlier, while the value of its investment in flagship carrier Aeroflot had shrunk to 30.7 billion roubles from 47.4 billion. 
Russia had planned to use NWF money to replace part of state borrowing this year, while also planning to channel up to 1 trillion roubles of the fund's money to support the battered stock market, as authorities look for ways to shield the economy from sanctions.

The preliminary S&P Global/CIPS composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for March edged down to 59.7 from a historically high 59.9 in February, much less of a fall than the drop to 57.8 forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
The PMI for Britain's private-sector services hit its highest in nine months, but output in the manufacturing sector was reported at its lowest in five months.
Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), said the further reopening of the economy after COVID-19 restrictions had helped to offset the drag from the conflict in Ukraine, Brexit and rising prices.
""However, the outlook darkened as concerns over Russia's invasion exacerbated existing worries over soaring prices, supply chains and slowing economic growth,"" he said. 
Average prices charged rose by the most since records began in 1999, driven by the services sector as businesses sought to pass on unprecedented rises in their operating expenses.
The Bank of England, which has raised interest rates at its last three meetings and is expected to do so again in May, is watching closely for signs that the recent acceleration in consumer price inflation is becoming embedded in the economy.

The PMI's measure of business optimism dropped to its lowest since October 2020.

""We expect growth of only between 2.2% and 3.1% this year,"" Ifo's chief economist Timo Wollmershaeuser said in a statement. In December, Ifo had forecast 3.7% growth. 
The institute revised its inflation forecast to between 5.1% and 6.1%, up from 3.3% which it had predicted in December.
""The Russian attack is dampening the economy via significantly higher raw material prices, sanctions, increasing supply bottlenecks for raw materials and increased economic uncertainty,"" said Wollmershaeuser.
The reduced forecasts come after three other institutes slashed their predictions last week due to the Ukraine war. The trio - the IfW, the RWI and the IWH - gave forecasts ranging from 2.1% to 3.1%.
The German government most recently forecast 2022 growth of 3.6%, up from 2.9% last year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes unexpectedly fell in February amid rising mortgage rates and higher house prices, which are squeezing out some first-time buyers from the market.
Despite the second straight monthly decline reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday, sales remained above their pre-pandemic level. Economists saw reduced affordability curbing activity in the near-term, but expected the new housing market to plod along this year given pent-up demand, a record low inventory of previously owned homes and strong wage gains.
""With interest rates climbing further because of the negative supply shock emanating from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, home sales are likely to trend lower in coming months,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. ""But unless mortgage rates spike or the economy stalls or worse, the falloff in new home sales should be modest.""  
New home sales decreased 2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 772,000 units last month. January's sales pace was revised down to 788,000 units from the previously reported 801,000 units. Sales surged 59.3% in the Northeast and increased 6.3% in the Midwest. But they fell 1.7% in the densely populated South and tumbled 13.0% in the West.
New homes are a leading indicator for the housing market as they are counted at the signing of a contract.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for 11.4% of U.S. home sales, would rebound to a rate of 810,000 units. Sales declined 6.2% on a year-on-year basis in February. They peaked at a rate of 993,000 units in January 2021, which was the highest since the end of 2006. 
Mortgage rates surged in February and have continued to push higher after the Federal Reserve last week raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years, and laid out an aggressive plan to push borrowing costs to restrictive levels by 2023.
The 30-year fixed rate vaulted 23 basis points to a three-year high of 4.50% last week, data from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed on Wednesday.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower as oil prices rose. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.
SUPPLY-DEMAND IMBALANCE
Though, mortgage rates remain low by historical standards, strong house price inflation has combined to significantly increase the typical monthly mortgage payment.
""Mortgage payments as a share of median family income have risen above 20% for the first time since late 2007,"" said Matthew Pointon, senior property economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""That will act to cool housing market activity. A record low number of existing homes on the market that implies new sales will grind out a small gain over 2022.""
Data last week showed sales of previously owned homes fell sharply in February. 
The median new house price in February increased 10.7% from a year ago to $400,600. House prices have risen 31% compared to three years ago. None of the houses sold last month were below $200,000. Strong house price growth is expected to persist through this year and into 2023.
""We may be approaching a pivot point when higher home costs and higher mortgage rates cool both sales and price increases, but given the supply-and-demand imbalance, we may not hit that point this year,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.
There were 407,000 new homes on the market, the highest since August 2008 and up from 398,000 units in January. Houses under construction made up 65% of the inventory, with homes yet to be built accounting for about 26%.

The backlog of homes approved for construction but yet to be started is at an all-time high as builders struggle with shortages and higher prices for inputs like lumber for framing, as well as cabinets, garage doors, countertops and appliances.
At February's sales pace it would take 6.3 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 6.1 months in January.

Purchases of new single-family homes decreased 2% to a 772,000 annualized pace following a downwardly revised 788,000 in January, government data showed Wednesday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 810,000 rate. 
The drop in sales suggests buyers are shying away from the market amid high home prices and rising mortgage rates as the Federal Reserve tightens policy. A recent report showed a measure of homebuilders’ sales expectations for the next six months slumped in March to the lowest since June 2020 amid growing concerns over the combination of rising construction costs and higher interest rates.
“We recognize that interest rates are rising and inflation is a legitimate threat,” Stuart Miller, executive chairman of  Lennar  Corp (NYSE:LEN)., said on an earnings call last week. Still, the homebuilder reported better-than-expected quarterly orders and raised its forecasts on expectations that demand will continue to outweigh supply.
The new-home sales report, produced by the Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, showed the median sales price of a new home jumped 10.7% in February from a year earlier, to $400,600. 
The number of homes sold during the month and awaiting the start of construction -- a measure of backlogs -- rose from January to 209,000, Wednesday’s report showed.
There were 407,000 new homes for sale as of the end of February, the most since August 2008, though roughly 91% were either under construction or not yet started. At the current sales pace, it would take 6.3 months to exhaust the supply of new homes, compared with 4.5 months one year ago.
Regionally, sales rose in the Northeast and Midwest and fell in the South and West.
New-home purchases account for about 10% of the market and are calculated when contracts are signed. They are considered a timelier barometer than purchases of previously-owned homes, which are calculated when contracts close. Separate data last week showed those sales fell in February to a six-month low.

Power and LMC Automotive said.
Supply bottlenecks were showing signs of easing in recent months, but that progress is likely to be stalled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine as well as new lockdowns in China following a resurgence in COVID-19 infections.
""This year, with fewer than 900,000 units in inventory, it will be impossible for the sale pace to even approach last year's level,"" said Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Powers. 
U.S. retail sales of new vehicles could fall 27.8% to 1,044,500 units in March from a year earlier, according to a report released by the consultants on Wednesday.
The consultants expect global vehicle sales in March to suffer from the added effect of the war in Ukraine and an increase in inflationary pressure on consumers worldwide.
Total new-vehicle U.S. sales for the month, including retail and non-retail transactions, are expected to reach 1,188,300 units, a 28.9% decrease from last year, the report showed.
With supply still lagging behind demand, the U.S. average of new-vehicle retail transaction price in March is expected to rise 17.4% to $43,737, dropping from the previous high in December 2021 at $45,283. 

The seasonally adjusted annualized rate for total new-vehicle sales is expected to be 12.7 million units, down 5.1 million units from 2021.
Separately, research firm Cox Automotive said https://www.coxautoinc.com/news/february-2022-forecast-u-s-auto-sales earlier this month that there is no indication that inventories will notably improve in March, and that the seasonally adjusted annual rate will drop well below January and February.

LONDON (Reuters) -British inflation shot up faster than expected last month to hit a new 30-year high, worsening a historic squeeze on household finances that finance minister Rishi Sunak is under pressure to ease in a budget update later on Wednesday.
The Office for National Statistics said consumer prices rose by 6.2% year-on-year in February after a 5.5% rise in January, its highest rate since March 1992.
Britain now has the second-highest annual inflation rate among Group of Seven countries, behind only the United States as global commodity and energy prices soar, exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 5.9% and only three of the 39 respondents had expected such a strong reading.
The ONS highlighted household energy bills - up almost 25% on a year ago - and petrol as the biggest drivers of February's price jump.
In a blow to poorer households, the ONS said food prices were rising across the board, unlike in normal times when some prices typically go up and others fall.
Sunak will aim to show at 1230 GMT that he is helping Britons through the worst cost-of-living squeeze in decades. [nL2N2VQ0F5]
Options include a fuel duty cut, pushing up the threshold at which people start to pay into the social security system and ensuring welfare payments keep up with inflation.
Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said the figures would also put pressure on the Bank of England to keep on raising interest rates, but she said it was still likely that price growth would peak before long. 
""Provided inflation expectations can be managed and global commodity prices stabilise by next year, we should see inflation returning to the Bank of England's 2% target by mid-2024,"" Selfin said. 
""This may require fewer rate rises than markets currently anticipate.""
Dan Boardman-Weston, chief investment officer at BRI Wealth Management, said raising rates at a time of high household bills and rising taxes could stifle the economic recovery.
""The Bank will need to carefully balance the need to try and tame inflation whilst not tipping the economy into a recession,"" he said.
The ONS said consumer prices rose by 0.8% in month-on-month terms, marking the biggest February rise since 2009.
Last week, the BoE raised its forecast for annual inflation to peak above 8% - more than four times its target - during the April-June period. Regulated household energy bills are due to jump by more than half next month.

Core inflation, which excludes the direct impact of food and energy costs, rose to 5.2% from 4.4% - also its highest since March 1992.
Inflation pressure ahead continued to build as manufacturers increased their prices by 10.1%, the biggest annual rise since September 2008 although it was in line with the median Reuters poll forecast.

Headline inflation rose by 4.3%, exceeding economists' median forecast of 4.2%, according to a statement from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). 
The core inflation rate — the central bank's favoured price measure — rose to 2.2% in February on a year-on-year basis, down slightly from 2.4% in the previous month. A Reuters poll of economists had forecast a 2.5% increase.
Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at OCBC, said she expected core prices to stay elevated in the first half of the year.
""We are seeing pricing pressure across a whole slew of different products and services. The tight labour market hasn't really fundamentally changed, so I think the pressure is still on MAS to tighten (interest rates) in April,"" she said.
The MAS tightened monetary policy in January this year, in its first out-of-cycle move in seven years, as global supply constraints and brisk economic demand elevated inflation pressures across the region.

The Singapore dollar fell marginally to S$1.3574 per dollar after the data was released.
The slight easing of core prices in February was due to lower inflation for services, food, electricity and gas, the MAS statement said.

LONDON (Reuters) -British public borrowing has fallen by more than half since its peak during the pandemic, but debt servicing costs are rising rapidly, official figures showed on Tuesday ahead of new budget plans from finance minister Rishi Sunak.
Sunak is under pressure to announce measures on Wednesday that will ease the immediate impact on households from soaring inflation, which is largely driven by higher energy costs, exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Borrowing for the first 11 months of the 2021/2022 financial year was 138.4 billion pounds ($182.3 billion), the Office for National Statistics said. This is 52% below the record 290.9 billion pounds borrowed between April 2020 to February 2021, when the public finances bore the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Compared with the government's most recent budget forecasts in October, Sunak has cash to spare.
Borrowing for 2021/22 is comfortably on track to undershoot the 183 billion pounds or 7.9% of gross domestic product forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility, largely thanks to stronger-than-expected tax revenue. 
But Sunak, in response to Tuesday's figures, said he wanted to take a ""responsible"" approach.
""With inflation and interest rates still on the rise, it's crucial that we don't allow debt to spiral and burden future generations with further debt,"" the finance minister, or chancellor, said in a statement.
Borrowing in 2020/21 hit a peacetime record of 14.8% of GDP. And although net debt is now falling as a share of GDP, around a quarter of British borrowing costs are tied to the rate of inflation, which is close to a 30-year high.
Debt servicing costs in February were 53% higher than a year earlier at 8.2 billion pounds.
""Strong tax receipts and a year-on-year fall in public borrowing present a positive backdrop to the chancellor's Spring Statement on Wednesday. But high inflation and the consequences of geopolitical uncertainty signal tougher fiscal times ahead,"" said Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to EY ITEM Club. 
Borrowing in February alone came in much higher than expected at 13.1 billion pounds - more than 5 billion pounds above economists' average forecast in a Reuters poll - although this overshoot was largely cancelled out by a 4.2 billion pound upward revision to January's budget surplus.
Public sector net debt, excluding state-owned banks, totalled 2.327 trillion pounds or 94.7% of GDP. 
Most economists expect Sunak to offer relatively limited support to hard-pressed households, in order to reduce government borrowing further after its COVID-19 surge and allow tax cuts nearer to a national election due by 2024.
Measures under consideration for announcement on Wednesday include reducing vehicle fuel taxes, raising the income level at which workers start paying social security contributions, and speeding up inflation-linked increases to welfare benefits.

But Sunak has made clear he wants to stick with plans announced in September to raise the overall rate of payroll taxes paid by workers and employers to fund rising health and social care costs.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian retail sales bounced back in January, beating expectations, as shoppers ventured out to car dealerships and home improvement shops, official data showed Friday, though February retail sales likely fell.
Retail sales increased 3.2% to C$58.94 billion ($46.7 billion) in January, led by higher sales of motor vehicles and parts, Statistics Canada said. Analysts had, on average, forecast a gain of 2.4%.
February retail sales most likely fell 0.5%, Statscan said in a preliminary estimate.
Sales increased in nine of 11 subsectors in January, representing 85.5% of retail trade. In volume terms, retail sales were up 2.9%.
""It was a happy new year for Canadian retailers in January, as Canadians offset the misery of renewed pandemic restrictions by doing a lot of shopping,"" said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, in a note.
The expected decline in February was based on responses from 36.6% of companies surveyed, Statscan said. The average final response rate for the survey over the previous 12 months has been 89.9%.
But a February drop in retail sales is unlikely to move the Bank of Canada off its current path of multiple rate hikes, said economists.
""Markets won't be that sensitive to these monthly growth indicators, since its going to take more than a bump in the road to alter the Bank of Canada's trajectory for now,"" said Shenfeld.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone's trade balance was in deficit for the third consecutive month in January as surging energy prices led to a sharp increase in the value of imports, even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted further price spikes.
Eurostat said the non-adjusted trade deficit of the 19 countries sharing the euro was 27.2 billion euros ($30.1 billion) compared with a 10.7 billion euro surplus a year earlier in January 2021. 
Payments for imports jumped by 44.3% year-on-year, while revenues from exports grew by only 18.9%.
Euro zone trade is rarely in deficit, but this was the third consecutive month of shortfall, and a substantially larger figure than in the previous two months.
The euro zone last had a negative trade balance in January 2014 and last experienced deficits of more than one month in 2011.
Germany's trade surplus fell by 78% from January 2021, France's deficit deepened, while Italy turned from surplus to deficit.
Data for the whole 27-nation European Union showed the cost of energy product imports more than doubled in January from a year earlier, with marked increases also for imports of other raw materials, chemicals and machinery.
The EU's trade deficits with energy supplier Russia more than doubled to 11.9 billion euros and with Norway grew from just 0.1 billion euros a year earlier to 5.8 billion euros. The deficit also nearly doubled with China to almost 34 billion euros, and widened with India and South Korea.

The EU maintained a surplus with the United States, Britain and Switzerland.
Adjusted for seasonal swings, the euro zone trade was also in deficit for a third consecutive month, although the 7.7 billion euro figure for January was slightly smaller than December's 9.7 billion euro shortfall.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week as demand for labor remained strong, positioning the economy for another month of solid job gains.
Unemployment benefit rolls were the smallest in 52 years in early March, the Labor Department's weekly jobless claims report on Thursday also showed. Signs of the economy's underlying strength against the backdrop of rising inflation and geopolitical tensions were also evident in other reports showing an acceleration in manufacturing production last month and a sharp rebound in homebuilding.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years, and laid out an aggressive plan to push borrowing costs to restrictive levels by 2023. The U.S. central bank said Russia's war against Ukraine was ""likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.""
""The Russian invasion of Ukraine adds some uncertainty to the outlook as energy prices have spiked, and business and consumer sentiment has taken a hit,"" said Dante DeAntonio, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""However, we expect firms to mostly look beyond the near-term volatility, especially given the difficult hiring environment that remains."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 214,000 for the week ended March 12. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 220,000 applications for the latest week. A 16,006 drop in claims in New York erased notable increases in Michigan, California and Ohio. 
Claims have declined from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020. The three-week old Russia-Ukraine war poses a risk to the U.S. labor market through disruptions of supply chains and record high gasoline prices. With companies hungry for labor, economists are optimistic the labor market and economy will ride out the storm.
There were 11.3 million job openings at the end of January, with a record 1.8 open positions per unemployed person. This misalignment between demand for labor and supply is boosting wage growth, which should provide some cushion to households against soaring gasoline prices.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday described the labor market as ""extremely"" tight, telling reporters that ""we think this labor market can handle, as I mentioned, tighter monetary policy, and the overall economy can as well.""

So far, the economy is holding up. A second report from the Philadelphia Fed on Thursday showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region accelerated in March, with manufacturers reporting strong growth in new orders as well as shipments.
Factories in the region encompassing eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware hired more workers and increased hours for employees. They, however, continued to struggle with higher input prices and delays getting materials, which kept order backlogs long.
Strong manufacturing was also underscored by a third report from the Fed showing production surged 1.2% in February, despite motor vehicle output sinking 3.5% because of a continued global shortage of electronic components.
""The impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, while mostly not reflected in this February report, could worsen supply problems, but our analysis suggests only minimal direct exposure for manufacturing,"" said Shannon Seery, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in New York.

Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of March's employment report. Claims fell considerably between the February and March survey periods, which bodes for job growth this month.
The economy created 678,000 jobs in February. Employment growth has been aided by the return of some workers to the labor force amid a significant decline in COVID-19 infections. 
More could rejoin the workforce this month. The claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 71,000 to 1.419 million during the week ended March 5, the lowest since February 1970.
The run on upbeat data was extended by a fourth report from the Commerce Department showing housing starts jumped 6.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.769 million units in February, the highest level since June 2006
While permits for future homebuilding fell 1.9% to a rate of 1.859 million units, they were not too far from the nearly 16-year high touched in January, suggesting an acute shortage of houses will continue to underpin residential construction even as mortgage rates rise.
Single-family housing starts, which account for the biggest share of homebuilding, jumped 5.7% to a rate of 1.215 million units last month. Starts for housing projects with five units or more gained 0.8% to a rate of 501,000. 
Graphic: Housing starts: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/byprjezjnpe/hsbp.png 
The backlog of houses approved for construction that are yet to be started hit a record 273,000 units as builders struggle with shortages and very expensive materials.

""The record high number of units that were authorized but not started, combined with the permits data, suggests that housing construction will continue to add to growth in the coming months, to the extent that builders can contend with supply constraints,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economist at Brean Capital in New York. 
In the wake of the data, the Atlanta Fed raised its estimate for first-quarter GDP growth to a 1.3% annualized rate from a 1.2% pace. It has been steadily boosting its forecast from as low as a 0.5% rate of contraction at the end of February. The economy grew at a robust 7.0% pace in the fourth quarter.

Manufacturing output increased 1.2% last month after edging up 0.1% in January, the Federal Reserve said on Thursday.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory production accelerating 0.6%. Output jumped 7.4% compared to February 2021.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, has benefited from a shift in spending to goods from services during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
But manufacturers have struggled to cope with the strong demand amid an acute worker shortage, caused by the coronavirus, on factory floors and other places along the supply chain.
Supply bottlenecks had shown signs of easing in recent months, but that progress is likely to be stalled by Russia's war against Ukraine as well as new lockdowns in China following a resurgence in COVID-19 infections. 
Production at auto plants fell 3.5% last month, marking the third straight monthly decline. Motor vehicle production continues to be restrained by a global shortage of electronic components.
February's surge in manufacturing output combined with a 0.1% gain in mining to lift industrial production 0.5%. That followed a 1.4% jump in January. Utilities production dropped 2.7% after vaulting 10.4% in January amid freezing temperatures in many parts of the country. 
Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, increased 0.9 percentage point to 78.0% in February. It is 2.5 percentage points higher than its pre-pandemic level but 0.1 percentage point below its long-run average.

Overall capacity use for the industrial sector rose 0.3 percentage point to 77.6% last month. It is 1.9 percentage points below its 1972-2021 average.
Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders slipped for the first time in five months in January, a worrying sign for an economy already facing heightened pressure from the Ukraine war and high energy and raw material prices.
The decline in core orders hurts hopes that a pickup in business spending will support private demand in the world's third-largest economy as firms struggle with surging input prices, a chip shortage and supply disruptions.
Core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, contracted 2.0% in January from December, posting their first drop in five months, the Cabinet Office data showed.
It was largely in line with economists' median estimate of a 2.2% contraction and followed a 3.1% jump in the previous month.
""The fall in machinery orders in January suggests that business investment may not recover much this quarter from a disappointing 2021,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
Japanese firms could delay spending plans due to higher commodity and transportation costs that are sending wholesale inflation soaring and squeezing corporate margins.
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude volatile numbers from shipping and electric power utilities, advanced 5.1% in January, the data found.
Orders from manufacturers lost 4.8% month-on-month, while those from non-manufacturers saw a 1.9% contraction.
""It's worrying that orders fell for most manufacturers,"" said Masato Koike, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Business conditions will likely worsen ahead for manufacturers as energy costs rise due to the crisis in Ukraine,"" he said.

After contracting in the third quarter of last year, Japan's economy returned to growth in October-December. But the rebound was smaller than initially estimated due to weaker growth in private consumption and capital expenditure. 
Ruling coalition officials this week called for a fresh spending package to offset the economic blow from the Ukraine crisis, which is already hurting households and retailers by driving up energy and food costs.

Unemployment declined to 4% in February, the lowest level since August 2008, exceeding expectations for it to edge down to 4.1%, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed on Thursday. Employment rose 77,400 from a month earlier, led by full-time roles, and more than double estimates. Labor market participation also edged higher.
“Participation rose to a new record high in February and was around 0.6 percentage points higher than the start of the pandemic,” said Bjorn Jarvis, head of labor statistics at the ABS. “The increase in participation continues to be particularly pronounced for women.”
The Australian dollar pushed slightly higher and was trading at 73.13 U.S. cents at 11:42 a.m. in Sydney.
The result suggests the Reserve Bank is likely to soon see the wages rises it wants before raising rates, with leading indicators pointing to the labor market tightening further. Money markets are pricing an RBA hike in June, while most economists have settled on August for rate liftoff.
Job ads data released last week showed construction and mining, mobile plant operators, animal and horticulture, education and healthcare are facing the sharpest labor squeeze at the moment.
Australia Help-Wanted Notices Surge as Omicron Wave Dissipates
RBA Governor Philip Lowe says policy makers can wait longer before raising rates as inflation Down Under isn’t as pressing as in other jurisdictions. He’s testing to see how far he can drive down the jobless rate with a record-low 0.1% cash rate before wages growth take off.
His stance contrasts with the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates for the first time since 2018 on Wednesday, a week after the European Central Bank delivered a hawkish surprise.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's gross domestic product (GDP) returned to growth in the final quarter of 2021 as the economy emerged from COVID-19 lockdowns, and economists said the data supported expectations the central bank would raise interest rates further. 
Production-based output grew by 3.0% in the quarter, Stats NZ said on Thursday. That was a touch below economists' median expectations of a 3.2% rise and a sharp turnaround from a revised 3.6% fall in the September quarter, when lockdowns had curbed activity.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) last month forecast growth for the December quarter at 2.3%.
""The Q4 GDP data reflect a robust, albeit very stimulated economy,"" ANZ economists said in a report. 
While there were a number of uncertainites on the outlook, the main concern was rising inflation in New Zealand that would require the RBNZ to further tighten policy, they added.
Annual GDP rose 3.1%, a little below a Reuters poll forecast of a 3.3% rise.
The RBNZ has already raised interest rates three times since October.
""Given that the rebound in activity in Q4 was above the RBNZ's expectations, today's data will keep the Bank on its hiking path,"" Ben Udy, economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.
OMICRON OUTBREAK
Economic growth improved as New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, moved out of a lengthy lockdown that had hit retail, manufacturing, construction and recreational activities in the prior quarter. Other parts of the country had also experienced shorter lockdowns in the third quarter.
Consumer and government spending were strong in the fourth quarter as was business investment, while trade was a drag as the country sucked in more imports, the data showed. There was also a big drag from inventories as companies ran down stocks to meet demand.

New Zealand's economy is being hit again this year as the country experiences its first significant nationwide outbreak of coronavirus infections as the Omicron variant spreads.
Although there are few restrictions in place, growing case numbers and hospitalisations have tempered people's desires to go out while sickness and isolation requirements are hurting some manufacturing sectors.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased moderately in February as more expensive gasoline and food forced households to cut back spending on other goods like furniture, electronics and appliances, which could restrain economic growth this quarter.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday, however, showed the rebound in sales in January was much stronger than initially estimated. Record gasoline and high food prices are hitting lower-income households the hardest. 
Overall, consumers are being cushioned by at least $2.5 trillion in excess savings accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Worker shortages with a near-record 11.3 million job openings at the end of January are boosting wages and allowing some Americans to pick up extra shifts to augment their income. 
""Though cooling after January's splurge, American consumers appear reasonably well positioned to keep spending, supported by recent massive job gains and high household savings,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
""This assumes, of course, no further major blows to fuel and food costs, confidence, and financial conditions stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war.""
Retail sales increased 0.3% last month. Data for January was revised sharply higher to show sales surging 4.9% instead of 3.8% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales growth slowing to 0.4%, with estimates ranging from as low as a 0.7% fall to as high as a 1.7% rise. 
Retail sales increased 17.6% from a year ago. Economists also viewed the pull back in monthly sales last month as pay back after January's surge, which was the largest gain in 10 months. Others saw the moderation as the beginning of a shift in spending back to services from goods amid a significant decline in coronavirus infections.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years, to quell inflation. The U.S. central bank laid out an aggressive plan to push borrowing costs to restrictive levels by next year. Fed said Russia's war against Ukraine was ""likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.""
Retail sales are mostly made up of goods and are not adjusted for inflation. Last month, sales at auto dealerships increased 0.8%. The rise likely reflected higher prices amid shortages, as motor vehicle manufacturers reported a decline in unit sales in February. Auto sales accelerated 6.9% in January.
Receipts at service stations shot up 5.3%. Gasoline prices jumped 24 cents to an average of $3.49 per gallon last month from January, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. They have since pushed to a record high above $4 per gallon after Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. 
The three-week war, which has killed hundreds of civilians, has boosted wheat prices and is expected to put more pressure on strained global supply chains. 
Annual consumer prices increased by the most in 40 years in February. Inflation is likely to remain uncomfortably high, with a separate report from the Labor Department on Wednesday showing import prices increasing 1.4% in February, lifted by higher costs for petroleum products and food.
Stocks on Wall street were trading higher amid signs of progress in Ukraine-Russia peace talks. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.
UNDERLYING STRENGTH 
Retail sales in February were held back by a 3.7% plunge in receipts at online retailers. Sales at furniture stores fell 1.0%. Consumers also cut back on spending at health and personal care stores, with sales declining 1.8%. Receipts at electronic and appliance stores dropped 0.6%. 
But consumers spent more on clothing as well as sporting goods, hobbies, musical instruments and books. Receipts at restaurants and bars rebounded 2.5%. Restaurants and bars are the only services category in the retail sales report.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales fell 1.2% in February. Data for January was revised substantially up to show these so-called core retail sales rebounding 6.7% instead of 4.8% as previously reported.
Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. The upward revision to January core retail sales offset the decline in February, which could leave consumer spending on a fairly strong growth path in the first quarter.
Indeed, economists at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) raised their consumer spending growth estimate to a 4.3% annualized rate from a 2.7% pace. That lifted their GDP growth forecast for the first quarter to a 3.7% rate from a 2.5% pace. 

Morgan Stanley's GDP growth estimates are on the upper end of the range, with some forecasts below a 1% pace. The economy grew at a robust 7.0% rate in the fourth quarter.
""Today's report continues to reflect strong consumer demand in the first quarter, despite the headwinds of elevated inflation,"" said Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley in New York. ""Upside in food services spending also indicates that we should see more upside in services spending this month, which will be reflecting in the personal spending report in two weeks.""

Inflation accelerated sharply as the currency fell to an all-time low and amid signs of increased demand for a wide range of goods, from food staples to cars, on expectations that their prices will rise further.
Weekly inflation slowed slightly to 2.09% in the week to March 11 from 2.22% a week earlier, which was the sharpest one-week increase in prices since the 1998 crisis, data from statistics service Rosstat showed.
Prices of nearly everything from baby food to pharmaceuticals rose sharply last week, with sugar and tomato prices rising by more than 12%, Rosstat data showed.
The central bank, which targets annual inflation at 4%, raised its key rate to 20% in late February.

""Tight monetary conditions facilitate inflation slowdown but, in our view, they won't save it from soaring above 20% this year,"" Raiffeisen Bank analysts said.

188,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 10:33AM ET</span>",,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business inventories increased strongly in January, though the pace slowed from prior months, which could result in inventory investment making no contribution to economic growth in the first quarter.
Business inventories rose 1.1% after advancing 2.4% in December, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. January's increase was in line with economists' expectations. Inventories gained 11.4% on a year-on-year basis in January.
Retail inventories increased 2.0% in January, instead of 1.9% as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 4.7% jump in December.
Motor vehicle inventories climbed 2.4% as estimated last month. They accelerated 6.9% in December. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, advanced 1.8%, rather than the 1.7% estimated last month.
Inventory investment surged at a robust seasonally adjusted annualized rate of $171.2 billion in the fourth quarter, contributing 4.90 percentage points to the quarter's 7.0% growth pace. Most economists see further scope for inventories to rise, noting that inflation-adjusted inventories remain below their pre-pandemic level. Sales-inventory ratios are also low.
But inventories are likely to be neutral to GDP growth this quarter, as they would need to increase at a similarly fast rate as in the fourth quarter to contribute to growth. 
Growth estimates for the first quarter have been slashed to below a 1% rate from around a 2% pace following Russia's war against Ukraine, which has boosted crude oil prices, sending U.S. gasoline prices to record highs. The Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has also led to a spike in prices of other commodities like wheat and is expected to further strain global supply chains.

Wholesale inventories increased 0.8% in January. Stocks at manufacturers rose 0.7%. 
Business sales increased 3.7% in January after falling 0.5% in December. At January's sales pace, it would take 1.25 months for businesses to clear shelves, down from 1.29 months in December.

(Reuters) -Canada's annual inflation rate accelerated in February to hit a fresh 30-year high, with broad price gains hitting consumers on all fronts, data showed on Wednesday, bolstering the case for the Bank of Canada to move forcefully on rates.
At 5.7%, the gain beat analysts' estimates of a rise of 5.5% and is the highest since August 1991, when the inflation rate hit 6.0%, Statistics Canada said. It was the 11th consecutive month above the Bank of Canada's 1% to 3% control range.
""Price increases were broad-based in February, pinching the pocketbooks of Canadians,"" Statscan said.
Gasoline prices jumped 32.3% compared with February 2021, while grocery prices were up 7.4%. Shelter costs jumped 6.6%, the biggest increase since 1983. Canadian home prices hit a new all-time high in February, data showed on Tuesday.
Price gains accelerated in six of eight major component baskets, with all three core measures of inflation rising.
""This is certainly not just the food and energy story ... We're seeing these gains sweeping through the core as well,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.
The CPI common measure, which the Bank of Canada says is the best gauge of the economy's performance, rose to 2.6% from 2.3% in January. CPI trim was 4.3% and CPI median was 3.5%.
The Bank of Canada hiked its policy rate for the first time in more than three years earlier this month, and Governor Tiff Macklem said the bank was prepared to act aggressively going forward to keep inflation expectations grounded.
Red-hot inflation could force that action, said economists.
""It adds to the case for having a bit of a bigger rate hike at the next meeting and shutting down the (bond) purchase program, as they've already guided,"" said Derek Holt, vice president of capital market economics at Scotiabank. 
""I think they have to hit the policy rate harder given how far behind they are on the inflation mandate,"" he added.

Money Markets see a roughly 60% chance of a 50 basis-point move from the Bank of Canada at its April meeting, with a total of seven hikes expected in 2022. [BOCWATCH]

Import prices rose 1.4% last month after rebounding 1.9% in January, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. In the 12 months through February, prices accelerated 10.9% after increasing 10.7% in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, increasing 1.5%.
The data does not capture the jump in prices of oil and other commodities, like wheat, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.
The report followed on the heels of news on Tuesday that producer prices increased solidly in February, driven by gasoline and food prices. The government last week reported an acceleration in consumer prices in February.
Imported fuel prices increased 6.9% last month after rebounding 7.7% in January. Petroleum prices shot up 8.1%, while the cost of imported food increased 1.5%.

Excluding fuel and food, import prices gained 0.6%. These so-called core import prices rose 1.1% in January. They increased 6.5% on a year-on-year basis in February.

192,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 12:56AM ET</span>",,,,,,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese consumers' inflation expectations hit a record high in March, a government survey showed on Wednesday, as people's perceptions of future price moves were affected by surging energy and food costs blamed on the Ukraine crisis.
While heightening inflation expectations could help the Bank of Japan (BOJ) achieve its elusive 2% price target, there is a danger that the rising raw material costs could cool consumption and the broader economy unless accompanied by wage hikes, analysts say.
Consumers' one-year inflation expectations hit 2.67% in March, up from 2.43% in February, and were the highest since comparable data became available in 2014, the survey showed.
Of the total, 15.5% said they expect prices to rise by around 3% a year from now, up from 13.7% in February and the highest ratio since 2019, according to the survey.
The survey was conducted between March 3-7.
Years of money printing by the BOJ has failed to fire up inflation to its 2% target, as weak consumption kept firms from raising prices for fear of scaring away buyers.
With wholesale inflation hitting four-decade highs, however, a growing number of companies are passing on costs to households. Analysts expect core consumer inflation, now hovering around zero, to approach the BOJ's 2% target from April due in part to surging energy costs.

Inflation expectation surveys are among factors the BOJ scrutinises in guiding monetary policy. But BOJ officials have stressed the bank's resolve to keep policy ultra-loose unless rising inflation is accompanied by steady increases in wages.
The BOJ is set to keep monetary policy ultra-loose on Friday and warn of heightening economic risks from the Ukraine crisis, unfazed by prospects of rising inflation and anticipated U.S. interest rate hikes.

Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities were flat at 0.00% month-on-month, compared with a 0.1% gain in January, according to Reuters calculations based on data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
From a year earlier, new home prices rose 2.0%, the slowest pace since December 2015, and also easing from the 2.3% growth in January.
China's property market slowed down sharply last year as Beijing's deleveraging campaign triggered a liquidity crisis in some major property developers, leading to bond defaults, a plunge in share prices and projects being shelved or left unfinished.
Authorities mainly in small cities have rolled out a slew of easing steps including smaller down-payments, cuts in mortgage rates and relaxations in purchase of second homes.
The looser regulations have yet to drive a nationwide rebound.
Monthly new home prices rose 0.5% in tier-one cities including Beijing and Shanghai, narrowing from the 0.6% growth in January.
In tier-two cities, which include some provincial capitals, new home prices were flat on month after January's 0.1% gain, while in tier-three and tier-four cities, prices fell 0.3%, widening from the 0.2% decrease in January. 
""A slight cooling in prices compared to January shows that there is resistance to a bounce,"" said Yan Yuejin, research director of Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development.
""We should be wary of a rapid cooling in tier-three and four cities.""
At the annual meeting of parliament earlier this month, Premier Li Keqiang said China will better meet homebuyers' legitimate needs, and will implement city-specific policies.
The number of cities reporting price gains decreased to 27 from 28 in January.
A surge in domestic Omicron cases in recent weeks have also cooled somewhat recovering demand in big cities.
Mainland China reported 1,952 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Tuesday, the country's national health authority said, compared with 3,602 a day earlier.
The outbreaks have led to a home buying freeze in local property markets in Shanghai, Shenzhen and the eastern city of Hangzhou, with a small rebound seen being halted, said Zhang Dawei, chief analyst at property agency Centaline.

""(But) the market is expected to stabilise in March-April as mortgage lending, the biggest factor, is easing.""
Household loans, mostly mortgages, suffered a rare contraction of 336.9 billion yuan in February, compared with 843 billion yuan in January, pointing to continued weakness in the property market, according to central bank data last week.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan reported a wider-than-expected trade deficit in February as an energy-driven surge in import costs caused by massive supply constraints added to vulnerabilities for the world's third-largest economy.
Exports rose slightly less than expected despite a rebound in China-bound shipments, in a worrying sign for an economy facing growing uncertainty from supply challenges and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""There's a big likelihood the trade deficit will expand further,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Although car exports picked up in February, they aren't in a situation of growing steadily due to supply disruptions and a chip shortage, while imports are swelling as oil and raw material prices soar."" 
Imports surged 34.0% in the year to February, Ministry of Finance data showed on Wednesday, above a median market forecast for a 28.0% gain in a Reuters poll.
That outstripped a 19.1% year-on-year rise in exports in February, resulting in a 668.3 billion yen ($5.65 billion) trade deficit, which was bigger than the 112.6 billion yen shortfall expected in a Reuters poll.
February's deficit was, however, narrower than January's 2.19 trillion yen gap, which was the biggest in a single month in eight years.
The finance ministry said exports declined a seasonally adjusted 0.5% from the previous month, underscoring headwinds in outbound shipments. Imports rose a seasonally adjusted 2.7% month-on-month.
""Exports fell again in February, though they should rebound over the coming months provided the recent Omicron outbreak in China doesn't cause major supply chain disruptions to resurface,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""Adding in the merchandise trade data for February, net trade could knock off as much as 1.0 percentage point from GDP (gross domestic product) growth this quarter as exports tread water but imports rise strongly.""
By region, exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, expanded 25.8% in the 12 months to February on stronger semiconductor machinery shipments to the country, after posting a Lunar New Year-linked contraction in the prior month.
Exports to the United States, the world's largest economy, grew 16.0% from the previous year in February, on stronger shipments of cars and semiconductor machinery.
The two biggest items contributing to the rise in imports were oil, including from United Arab Emirates, and liquefied natural gas, such as from Australia, the data showed.
The Reuters Tankan poll for March showed Japanese manufacturers feared a fresh surge in energy prices due to the Ukraine crisis, even as they reported the first improvement in their business confidence in three months.
Japan's economy rebounded less than initially estimated in the final quarter of 2021, the government said last week, on weaker growth in consumer and business spending.
The downgrade in fourth quarter growth was bad news for policymakers tasked with sustaining a fragile recovery as the Ukraine crisis clouds the outlook for the global economy.
Norinchukin's Minami said that worsening conditions due in part to rising raw material prices could end up squeezing Japanese manufacturers' profits and may lead to economic growth forecasts being lowered for fiscal 2022, which starts in April.

Many expectations are still for 2.0%-3.0% growth in the coming fiscal year, he added.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's annual unemployment rate fell to the lowest on record in February, with jobs growth staying at a near 22-year-high, though the increase was mainly due to a low base and the government's fiscal spending.
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate last month dropped to 2.7%, Statistics Korea data showed on Wednesday, the lowest since data releases began in June 1999. It came in at 3.6% in January.
The number of employed increased by 1.037 million from a year earlier in February, not far from January's jobs growth of 1.135 million, which was the most since March 2000.
February's figures were also flattered by comparisons to the very weak readings from a year earlier.
The country posted 12 straight months of job losses through to February 2021, while the jobless rate soared to over a 20-year high of 5.2% in January 2021, as the coronavirus hit the nation's labour market.
A breakdown of data showed 254,000 jobs were added in healthcare and social services in February 2022, a quarter of the total, while some 135,000 jobs were added in transportation and warehouses.
Jobs in the wholesale and retail industry, however, continued to shrink, losing 47,000 jobs from a year earlier. Those in the key manufacturing sector rose 32,000, but that was less than a month earlier and growth remained weak.
The fast-spreading Omicron variant will likely take a toll on the already gloomy outlook for such sectors, with the country reporting a daily record of 400,741 new coronavirus cases for Tuesday.
Some 1.78 million people have been forced to stay at home for treatment, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said.

Wednesday's jobs data comes a week after conservative South Korean opposition candidate Yoon Suk-yeol won a tight presidential election, with jobs being one of the major challenges for the president-elect.
To shore up the economy, the government has allocated about a third of the total government expenditure to welfare and jobs, and promised to spend about 70% of the annual fiscal budget during the first half of 2022.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' business confidence improved for the first time in three months in March, as automakers became less pessimistic, though firms feared a fresh surge in energy prices due to the Ukraine crisis, the Reuters Tankan poll showed.
Service-sector sentiment turned negative for the first time since October due to COVID-19 curbs and as global inflation squeezed corporate profits, according to the poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched ""tankan"" quarterly survey.
While the mood among manufacturers remained positive for the 14th straight month, managers voiced concerns about a wide array of downside risks that cloud the outlook for the world's third-largest economy, days before the BOJ's next policy meeting.
""It's a quadruple whammy,"" said a machinery maker manager in the poll, referring to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a hit to output from Omicron infections, supply disruptions and soaring costs on everything from high-tech chips to transportation.
The Reuters Tankan manufacturers' sentiment index rose to 8 in March from 6 last month, marking its first month-on-month improvement since December. The service-sector index extended a decline for the second month to a five-month low of minus 1, compared with the previous month's 3.
(For a detailed table of the results, click)
Manufacturers' sentiment got a boost from fading pessimism among automakers, whose sub index rose to a three-month high of minus 14 in March from February's minus 29.
Support also came from growing optimism among food and precision machinery producers, and the steel/nonferrous metals sub-sector turning less negative.
Many firms, however, expressed worries about commodity inflation in the March 2-11 poll of 501 big and mid-sized companies, of which 240 responded.
""While demand is recovering, price hikes in energy and raw materials have made it hard to maintain profit levels,"" said a paper company manager.
In non-manufacturing, three out of six sectors saw their sentiment worsen, including real estate/construction and retailers. 
The government's extension of coronavirus curbs has been suppressing shopper turnout and prevented sales from recovering to their pre-pandemic levels, a retail manager said.
While nationwide daily infections peaked at more than 100,000 in early February, they remained elevated through much of the month. The government may lift pandemic curbs still in place in Tokyo and 17 other prefectures as early as March 21, when they are set to expire.
Looking ahead, manufacturers saw business sentiment rising to 11 three months ahead, while services firms expected their mood to recover to 10, but those outlook readings were less positive than 18 and 14, respectively, recorded last month.
The Reuters Tankan index readings are calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A positive reading means optimists outnumber pessimists.

The Bank of Japan will release its quarterly tankan business survey next on April 1 at 8:50 a.m. local time (March 31, 2350 GMT).
The central bank is scheduled to end a two-day rate review on Friday, its first since the start of the Ukraine crisis.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) -Argentina's monthly inflation rocketed to 4.7% in February, the state statistics agency said on Tuesday, the highest since March 2021 and far above forecasts as the South American country's president promised a ""war"" against spiraling prices.
The grains-producing country's annual inflation rate was already running at over 50% when Russia's invasion of Ukraine super-charged global commodities costs, a major headache for the government ahead of general elections next year.
Center-left President Alberto Fernandez, with an eye on a inflation targets recently agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), pledged to roll out a package of anti-inflation measures at the end of the week.
""I promise another fight will start on Friday, the war against inflation in Argentina,"" he said. ""We are going to put an end to speculators and we are going to put things in order.""
The monthly jump was well above an estimated 4% rise projected by analysts polled by Reuters. Prices jumped 8.8% year-to-date and 12-month rolling inflation hit 52.3%.
The government has agreed an economic plan as part of a $45 billion deal with the IMF that targets inflation of 38%-48% this year. That agreement needs Congress and IMF board approval.
The Economy Ministry said in a statement that the war in Ukraine was pushing up commodities prices while a drought in Argentina had hit grain production.
""The Russian-Ukrainian war is present in Argentina and that is seen in the prices paid for everything associated with commodities, which are increasing,"" Economy Minister Martin Guzman had said on Monday.
Argentina, the world's No. 1 processed soy exporter and No. 2 for corn, has benefited from high grains prices on its exports, though it has struggled to tamp down domestic prices. 
""The rise in the price of commodities worldwide adds more fuel to the fire,"" said Isaías Marini, an economist at consulting firm Econviews. ""The figure for March will probably be even higher than that for February.""
The government has imposed caps on some grains exports and price freeze agreements on some foods. This week it halted new overseas sales of soy oil and meal, its top exports.
Horacio Larghi, economist at consultancy Invenómica said rising prices of food inputs would start to feed through to consumers.
""In March the situation has become very complicated with strong increases in flour and oils prices, which will undoubtedly soon be transferred to the prices of final goods,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's lowest-paid workers have seen the biggest squeeze on their pay over the past 12 months, according to figures on Tuesday which suggest the cost of living crisis is likely to prove even more painful than headline figures imply.
British consumer price inflation hit a nearly 30-year high of 5.5% in January and is forecast by economists to reach 8% in April, boosted by a 50% rise in household regulated energy tariffs on top of the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Britain's main measure of wages - average weekly earnings - is already struggling to keep up, with pay in the three months to January 4.8% higher than a year before.
But separate figures based on employers' tax reports showed that pay for the lowest-earning 10% of staff - who make 8,124 pounds ($10,612) a year - has risen just 0.6% over the past year.
By contrast, the highest 10% of earners - who make 57,900 pounds a year - have seen a 4.9% pay rise and the richest 1% have enjoyed a 6.5% pay rise.
""These pay trends help to explain the UK's (tax) revenue-rich recovery, but also means real wages will fall fastest for those who can least afford it,"" the Resolution Foundation think tank said.
Some of the difference probably reflects distortions as staff move on and off furlough, but top earners have still done best overall since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Wages for the lowest-paid 10% have risen 8.1% versus a 9.1% rise for the top 10%.

Britain's main minimum wage rate of 8.91 pounds an hour is due to rise 6.6% to 9.50 pounds an hour on April 1. But most workers will also face a higher tax burden from increased social security charges which take effect at the same time.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased solidly in February as the cost of goods like gasoline surged, and further gains are in the pipeline following Russia's war against Ukraine, which has made crude oil and other commodities more expensive.
The report from the Labor Department on Tuesday offered more evidence that inflation would remain uncomfortably high in the months ahead, despite underlying price pressures at the factory gate rising moderately last month. 
The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday for the first in just over three years, with inflation running way above the U.S. central bank's 2% target. Economists are forecasting as many as seven rate hikes this year.
""We expect March PPI to show larger increases as commodity prices increase and global trade disruptions amplify,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""For consumer prices to slow, firms will first have to grapple with disruptions from the Russian invasion and new lockdowns in the heart of China's most productive regions.""  
The producer price index for final demand increased 0.8% after accelerating 1.2% in January. Goods prices shot up 2.4%, the largest gain since December 2009, after rising 1.5% in January. A 14.8% jump in wholesale gasoline prices accounted for nearly 40% of the increase in goods prices. Gasoline prices rose 3.3% in January. Food prices advanced 1.9% last month.
Services were unchanged after increasing 1.0% in January. 
The PPI climbed 10% in the 12 months through February, matching the gain in January. Last month's increase in the PPI was in line with economists' expectations. The data does not capture the jump in prices of oil and other commodities, like wheat, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as oil prices retreated to below $100 a barrel after Russia said it was in favor of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal resuming as soon as possible. Crude oil prices shot up more than 30%, with global benchmark Brent hitting a 14-year high of $139 a barrel, in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were largely trading higher.
SENTIMENT TAKES A HIT
Higher oil prices and the Russia-Ukraine war weighed on business sentiment in New York state. In a separate report on Tuesday, the New York Fed said its general business conditions index slumped 14.9 points to -11.8 in March, the weakest reading since May 2020. A reading below zero indicates a contraction in factory activity in the state.
Manufacturers reported a contraction in new orders and shipments, but continued to pay higher prices for inputs as well as charge more for their finished goods.
""Geopolitical uncertainty likely bears much of the blame,"" said Adam Kamins, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Many firms are sitting tight, either because their customers are doing so or in order to gauge the economic ramifications of the invasion.""
Despite the pullback in oil prices, inflation is likely to remain hot as a resurgence in COVID-19 infections in China, a major source of raw materials for U.S. factories, puts more pressure on supply chains. Inflation was already a problem before the Russia-Ukraine war.
The government last week reported an acceleration in consumer prices in February, with the annual inflation rate posting its largest increase in 40 years.
High inflation, mostly in the form of more expensive gasoline, has prompted economists to trim their economic growth estimates for this year. So far, a recession is not anticipated as households accumulated massive savings during the pandemic.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices climbed 0.2% in February, the smallest gain since November 2020. The so-called core PPI increased 0.8% in January. It was last month held back by a 4.2% decline in portfolio management fees as investors dumped equities in favor of the dollar and U.S. Treasuries. 
There were also decreases in the prices of hotel and motel rooms as well as apparel, jewelry, footwear, and accessories retailing. That offset a 1.9% rise in the cost of transportation and warehousing services. Airline fares rebounded 3.0%, while healthcare costs rose moderately. 
In the 12 months through February, the core PPI increased 6.6% after gaining 6.8% in January. 
With the CPI and PPI data in hand, economists are estimating that the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.4% in February after gaining 0.5% in January. 

That would lead to an annual increase of 5.5% in the core PCE price index, which advanced 5.2% on a year-on-year basis in January. It is one of the key inflation measures watched by Fed officials. 
""This is consistent with the idea that underlying inflation is running at or above 5%,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. 
 
"
200,"<span>Mar 15, 2022 08:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Prices paid to U.S. producers rose strongly in February on higher costs of goods, underscoring inflationary pressures that set the stage for a Federal Reserve rate hike this week. 
The producer price index for final demand increased 10% from February of last year and 0.8% from the prior month, Labor Department data showed Tuesday. That followed an upwardly revised 1.2% monthly gain in January.
The median forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 10% year-over-year increase and a 0.9% monthly advance.
Two year Treasury yields extended declines and U.S. stock futures rose after the data showed producer prices rose less than expected on a monthly basis.
The data reflect the biggest monthly gain in the price of goods in data back to 2009, with two-thirds of the increase due to energy. It’s the latest indication of rapid inflation in the U.S., and prices are poised to accelerate further after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent prices of some raw materials to new highs. 
While that bolsters the case for the Fed to be aggressive in tamping down inflation in the coming months, the central bank will have to balance curbing inflation without stifling economic growth.
The Fed will have the latest inflation data in hand for its meeting that concludes Wednesday, when policy makers are widely expected to increase interest rates for the first time since 2018. Along with the decision, the Fed will release updated forecasts for inflation and growth.
The data suggest persistent inflationary pressures in production will filter through to consumer prices, which rose in February at the fastest pace in 40 years, in part due to higher gasoline, food and housing costs. That’ll only worsen given the war, and China’s lockdown of Shenzhen -- one of the nation’s most populous cities and a technology hub -- is expected to disrupt fragile supply chains even more.
Core Prices
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core PPI increased 0.2% from a month earlier and was up by a 8.4% from a year ago, both missing estimates. 
There were signs in other parts of the economy that inflationary pressures were cooling. Prices for final demand services were little changed from January, the first month without an increase since December 2020. An increase in transportation and warehousing services costs was offset by declines in portfolio management and apparel and accessories retailing.

BERLIN (Reuters) -German investor sentiment suffered a record slide in March due to the war in Ukraine and economic sanctions on Russia, a survey showed on Tuesday, with collapsing expectations making a recession in Europe's largest economy ""more and more likely"".
The ZEW economic research institute said its economic sentiment index dropped to -39.3 points from 54.3 in February. The fall was the biggest since the survey began in December 1991. A Reuters poll had pointed to a reading of 10.0 for March.
""A recession is becoming more and more likely. The war in Ukraine and the sanctions against Russia are significantly dampening the economic outlook for Germany,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement.
""The collapsing economic expectations are accompanied by an extreme rise in inflation expectations,"" he added. 
An index for current conditions fell to -21.4 from -8.1. The consensus forecast was for a reading of -22.5.
Germany's finance minister said on Monday the cabinet would approve a draft 2022 budget on Wednesday but that he would submit supplementary fiscal plans to parliament in the coming weeks to reflect the economic impact of the war in Ukraine.
In evidence of the fallout from the Ukraine crisis in corporate Germany, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) CEO Herbert Diess said on Tuesday the full impact of the war was not yet clear and was throwing the carmaker's 2022 outlook into question.
German industrial production rose at the start of the year, but economists said it could slump due to the fallout from the war in Ukraine.
Alexander Krueger at Hauck Aufhaeuser Lampe, a private bank, said the ZEW result was ""a disaster for the economic outlook.""
""The ZEW index gives a bad foretaste of sentiment indicators still to come,"" he added. ""The economy is teetering on the brink of recession.""

The European Central Bank said last week it will stop pumping money into financial markets this summer, paving the way for an increase in interest rates as soaring inflation outweighs concerns about the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""The ECB's job is not getting any easier with the darkening economic outlook,"" said Ulrich Wortberg, economist at Heleba.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said industrial output in the 19 countries sharing the euro was unchanged month-on-month in January and down 1.3% year-on-year.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.1% monthly gain and a 0.5% annual decline.
Eurostat said the non-durable consumer goods, such as clothing, rose by 3.1% from December. Production of durable consumers goods, intermediate goods such as steel, energy and capital goods all fell, the latter by 2.4%.

In year-on-year terms, output of non-durable consumer goods showed the strong increase of 7.0%, while capital goods, such as machinery and equipment for industry, declined by 8.4%.
Industrial output is an important component of gross domestic product, which rose 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the October-December period for a 4.6% year-on-year expansion.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's unemployment rate dropped below its pre-pandemic rate in the three months to January while pay rose faster than expected, according to official figures that are likely to bolster the Bank of England's plans to raise interest rates. 
The jobless rate fell more than expected to 3.9%, despite the Omicron wave of COVID-19, data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed on Tuesday. That was down from 4.1% in the last quarter of 2021 and its lowest level since the three months to January 2020.
Job vacancies hit a fresh record high in the three months to February at 1.318 million, underscoring the labour shortage facing many employers.
""The further tightening in the labour market will only encourage the Bank of England to raise interest rates on Thursday ... despite the coming extra hit to households' real incomes from the war in Ukraine,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.
The BoE is expected to raise the Bank Rate by a quarter point to its pre-crisis level of 0.75% after the central bank's monthly policy meeting on Thursday.
Some of its policymakers have been concerned by a BoE survey of businesses which showed firms planned to raise pay by nearly 5% this year - much more than previous years or pay settlements suggested by other surveys.
Four policymakers voted last month to raise rates to 0.75% rather than the 0.5% finally decided upon.
The BoE is worried that high inflation caused by soaring energy prices and post-COVID bottlenecks could prove slow to dissipate. 
PAY BARELY MATCHES PRICES
Average earnings in the three months to January were 4.8% higher than a year earlier, above forecasts in a Reuters poll for a 4.6% rise.
While this is barely keeping up with the rate of inflation - and equivalent to a 0.1% real-terms pay rise using the ONS's preferred CPIH inflation rate - it represents faster pay growth than in the run-up to the pandemic.
However, a narrower measure of real-terms pay excluding bonuses was 1.0% lower than a year earlier - the biggest annual fall since the three months to July 2014.
Living standards are likely to see their biggest drop in 30 years this year, according to BoE forecasts that pre-date the latest inflation shock caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has sent energy and some commodity prices surging.
In the medium term this squeeze to real incomes is likely to limit inflation pressures as domestic demand is hit and unemployment rises, the BoE predicts.
Economists are also unsure whether the pandemic has led to any lasting change in British workers' bargaining power, which has been weak since the 2008 global financial crisis.
Although British economic output is now slightly higher than before the pandemic, its labour force has shrunk by around 500,000 - largely due to workers aged 50 and over dropping out, often to retire early.
Tuesday's figures showed employment fell by 12,000 in the three months to January, below poll forecasts for a rise of 23,000.

Less reliable preliminary payroll figures for February - which are based on tax data that does not include the self-employed - showed a monthly surge of 275,000. But January's increase was revised down to 61,000 from 108,000.
British finance minister Rishi Sunak said he was confident that the labour market was ""in a good position to deal with the current global challenges"" with redundancies at record lows.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's economy perked up in the first two months of 2022, with key indicators all exceeding analysts' expectations, although a surge in Omicron cases, property weakness and heightened global uncertainties are weighing on the outlook.
Industrial output rose 7.5% in January-February from a year earlier, the fastest pace since June 2021 and up from a 4.3% increase seen in December, data from National Statistics Bureau showed on Tuesday. That compared with a 3.9% rise expected by analysts in a Reuters poll. 
Retail sales, a gauge of consumption that has been lagging since COVID-19 hit, expanded 6.7% year-on-year amid rising demand during the Lunar New Year holidays and Winter Olympic Games. It also marked the quickest clip since June last year and beat expectations of a 3.0% increase in the poll.
It eked out a 1.7% gain in December. 
The surprisingly strong performance of the world's second largest economy in the New Year may have enabled the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to hold policy rates steady on Tuesday, Iris Pang, Greater China chief economist at ING, said in a note. 
The PBOC kept the rate on its one-year medium-term lending facility loans unchanged earlier in the day, dashing expectations for a cut, although investors believe policymakers may resume monetary easing soon to prop up the cooling economy.
The statistics released combined January-February economic data to help smooth out distortions caused by the Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in early February this year.
One highlight from the data was the strong growth in retail sales, which received a boost from product sales related to the Winter Olympic Games, such as skiing equipment and ice sports, Fu Linghui, spokesman for the statistics bureau, told a press conference.
The mascot Bing Dwen Dwen has been an unexpected star of the Beijing Olympics, with thousands of fans lining up in sub-freezing temperatures to buy merchandise - from magnets and key chains to bags and stuffed toys - and factories scrambling to make more.
The solid numbers came after growth lost momentum throughout last year due to a liquidity crunch in the property market and strict anti-virus measures that hit consumption.
""Indeed, every data point has been rebounding, mainly because policy effects kicked in early this year, with loosening in the infrastructure and property sectors. Catering spending also remained relatively strong,"" said Qu Qing, chief economist at Jianghai Securities.
However, analysts warn any nascent recovery, which would help China achieve an ambitious target of around 5.5% for 2022, could not be sustained due to surging COVID cases, a weak property market and the uncertain global recovery.
China stocks fell sharply on Tuesday as an increase in coronavirus cases overshadowed the data and threatened the outlook.
""The economic recovery momentum in January-February was good. At the same time, we should also see that the external environment is still complex and severe, and China's economic development faces many risks and challenges,"" said Fu from the statistics bureau.
Analysts expect the central bank to continue to ease policy to support the economy. 
""We should still cut interest rates and reserve requirement ratios as soon as possible. There should not be any hesitation in terms of providing support from loosening policies,"" said Wang Jun, chief economist at Zhongyuan Bank.
Premier Li Keqiang said last week that he is confident of hitting this year's economic growth target of around 5.5% despite challenges including the war in Ukraine. Li also vowed to provide more policy support in the year.
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT PICKING UP 
Fixed-asset investment rose 12.2% in January-February from a year earlier, compared with the 5.0% increase tipped by a Reuters poll and 4.9% growth in 2021. The figure was the highest since July last year.
Infrastructure investment rose 8.1%, helped by a move to front-load 2022 local government special bonds to this year. 
Property investment rose 3.7% from a year in the first two months of 2022, following a 13.9% slump in December, data showed.
The downturn in the property market also showed signs of easing, but sales are still mired in contraction while new construction starts fell by double digits.
""We have continued to stabilise land prices, house prices and expectations, and there have been positive changes in the real estate market,"" Fu said.
China's property market chilled last year as Beijing's deleveraging campaign triggered a liquidity crisis in some major property developers, leading to bond defaults, a plunge in share prices and projects being shelved or left unfinished.

""The resurgence of COVID in multiple provinces poses an additional drag on activity growth. Despite local property policy easing, property indicators, in particular new starts and land sales, deteriorated further. More policy easing would be required to achieve the challenging 'around 5.5%' growth target this year,"" analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) wrote in a note. 
The nationwide survey-based jobless rate rose to 5.5% in February, up from 5.3% in January, but Fu said the rise was largely due to seasonal factors and the rate could drop after March.

Investing.com – China’s factory production, retail sales, and fixed asset investment beat expectations in the first two months of 2022. The growth came despite the country’s latest COVID-19 outbreak, a property market downturn, and growing global uncertainties.
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data released on Tuesday showed that Chinese industrial production grew 7.5% year-on-year in January-February 2022, the fastest pace since June 2021. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a growth of 3.9% while a growth of 4.3% was recorded for December 2021.
Retail sales grew 6.7% year-on-year, also the fastest since June 2021, due to rising demand during the Lunar New Year holidays and the Beijing Winter Olympics. This contrasts with the 1.7% growth in December 2021 and forecasts prepared by Investing.com that predicted a growth of 3%.
The data also showed that fixed asset investment rose 12.2% year-on-year, compared with the 4.9% growth in December 2021, the highest since July 2021. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a growth of 5%. The unemployment rate rose to 5.5% in January-February, above the 5.1% that was recorded in December 2021 and predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com.
“Overall, the economy had good recovery momentum in January and February,” NBS spokesman Fu Linghui said in a statement. However, the “external environment still remains complex and grim, and there are many risks and challenges faced by China’s economy,” the statement added.
However, the latest COVID-19 outbreak, and ensuing lockdowns, could spread to more cities and impact economic growth, warned some investors.
""I don't think we should be fooled by the surprisingly strong Jan-Feb data... We should still cut interest rates and reserve requirement ratios as soon as possible,"" Zhongyuan Bank chief economist Wang Jun told Reuters. ""There should not be any hesitation in terms of the support from loosening policies.""
The People's Bank of China also kept the one-year medium-term lending facility unchanged at 2.85%, going against expectations for a cut.
China’s factory activity is normally slow during the first two months of the year due to the Lunar New Year holidays. However, many workers did not travel during the holiday due to COVID-19 prevention measures, which kept productivity levels up."
207,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 10:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economy started the first two months of the year on a strong footing, although risks are growing as the number of local coronavirus cases surge and global energy prices spike due to Russia-Ukraine tensions.
Industrial output grew 7.5% in the two months through February, figures from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Tuesday, compared with 4.3% in December. Economists had expected 4% expansion.
Retail sales rose 6.7%, accelerating from 1.7% in December and beating a 3% increase projected by economists. Investment climbed 12.2% during the two-month period, better than the 5% estimate and last year’s 4.9% growth. The surveyed jobless rate rose to 5.5% last month.        
“Overall the economy had good recovery momentum in January and February,” the NBS said in a statement. However, the “external environment still remains complex and grim, and there are many risks and challenges faced by China’s economy,” it added. 
Data in the first two months are usually distorted by the Lunar New Year holidays and also complicated by the high base of comparison from last year.  
China’s benchmark CSI 300 Index pared a loss of as much as 2.9% after the data, with a sub-gauge of consumer staples trimming its decline by more than half. The futures contract on 10-year government bonds dropped 0.25% as of 10:06 a.m. local time.
Property Slump
The economy has been hit hard by a slump in the property market, with official data showing ongoing weakness in the sector. Residential property sales contracted 22.1% in the first two months of the year from the same period in 2021. 
The outlook for this year is rapidly worsening amid heightened geopolitical tensions and Covid lockdowns in China, making it even harder for the government to achieve its ambitious growth target of around 5.5% this year. 
The People’s Bank of China surprised many by refraining from lowering a key interest rate on Tuesday ahead of the data release. The rate on the one-year medium-term lending facility was left unchanged at 2.85%. A majority of economists in a Bloomberg survey had predicted a 10-basis point cut. 
Instead, the PBOC added monetary stimulus by injecting a net 100 billion yuan ($15.7 billion) of funds into the financial system.  
Credit expansion slowed in February, data released Friday showed, with a key indicator of home mortgages declining for the first time in at least 15 years despite efforts to boost borrowing by cutting rates and lowering down payments. That meant lending to households had the weakest start to any year since 2016. 
The virus outbreaks this month are the worst since the peak of the first wave in Wuhan, and may trigger lockdowns of a larger scale and put much of the world’s second largest economy on halt. The nation has already put major cities including Shenzhen under lockdown, ordered a shutdown of schools and suspension of inter-city bus services in Shanghai, and restricted people in Jilin province from leaving the region. 
The economic cost could subtract 0.8 percentage point from the gross domestic product growth rate if the whole of China’s coastal and northeastern provinces impose similar one-week lockdowns, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (OTC:ANZBY) Ltd. estimates.

208,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 02:37PM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) - British businesses' optimism is beginning to falter as the potential impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on inflation and consumer spending becomes clearer, the Confederation of British Industry said on Monday.
""Listening to them in the last two weeks, I think you are starting to see business confidence starting to waver now,"" CBI Director-General Tony Danker told the British parliament's Treasury Committee.
Unlike some European countries, Britain trades relatively little with Russia. But higher costs for energy and other inputs were eroding confidence that had been created by the fading of headwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic, Danker said.
Amrita Sen, director of research at economics consultancy Energy Aspects, said she viewed the risk of recession as ""very, very high"" and said Germany could face diesel rationing by the end of the month, with knock-on impacts for Britain.
Jagjit Chadha, director of Britain's National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), also warned that growth risked grinding to a halt.
""At current energy and oil prices, the UK is skirting very close to a fall in activity. We're going to be hovering around zero next year,"" he told the parliament hearing into the economic impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
British regulated household energy tariffs are already due to rise by more than half next month due to rises in energy costs that pre-date Russia's Feb. 24 invasion.

On Feb. 4 the Bank of England forecast that 2022 would see one of the biggest squeezes on living standards in 30 years, and estimated annual economic growth would slow to about 1.6% by the end of the year.
Inflation is likely to peak above 7% in April, and the central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates back to their pre-pandemic level of 0.75% on Thursday in a bid to stop inflation overshooting its target for too long.

(Reuters) - U.S. consumers upped their outlook for where inflation will be a year from now and in three years time, and they expect to spend substantially more on food, gas and rent in the next 12 months, according to a survey released on Monday by the New York Federal Reserve. 
Expectations for where inflation will be in one year increased to 6.0% in February from 5.8% in January, returning to the high reached in November for the survey, which was launched in 2013. Expectations for inflation three years out rose to a median of 3.8% from 3.5%, remaining below the levels seen in November and December of last year. The rise in inflation expectations reverses some of the declines seen in January. 
Graphic: Inflation expectations edge higher: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/CONSUMER-EXPECTATIONS/myvmnbbbzpr/chart.png 
U.S. households are coping with the fastest pace of price increases in 40 years and policymakers are watching closely to see if the shock leads to higher inflation expectations, which could fuel further price hikes, or if consumers largely view the surge in prices as temporary. While near-term inflation expectations have soared, consumers' longer-term expectations have so far been less affected. 
The Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has led to higher fuel prices and may lead to increased food costs, adds more uncertainty to the outlook. 
A measure of market-based U.S. inflation expectations by the London-based ICE (NYSE:ICE) Benchmark Administration (IBA) showed that near-term forecasts jumped sharply in response to government data that showed inflation running about 7%, and rose again after the Russian attack. Long-term inflation expectations inched higher following the Russian invasion.
Fed officials are expected to take a key step in the fight against inflation when they meet this week on Tuesday and Wednesday by raising interest rates from near-zero levels, roughly two years after they slashed rates in response to the coronavirus pandemic. 
The U.S. economy is on more stable footing now, with the unemployment rate at 3.8% and wages rising. But many households are also struggling with rising costs. 

As of February, consumers said they expect their spending to increase by 6.4% in one year, up sharply from the 5.5% anticipated in January and reaching a new high for the survey. They also expect food prices to increase by 9.2% in one year, up from the 5.9% expectation in January, and gas prices to rise by 8.8%, up from a previous estimate of 7.3%. 
The New York Fed's monthly survey of consumer expectations is based on a rotating panel of 1,300 households.

The nights spent in EU short-stay tourist accommodation surged 237% to 102.2 million nights in December compared to a year earlier, Eurostat said, though this remained 27% below the 2019 figure.
Easing coronavirus restrictions and widespread vaccination campaigns helped tourism recover from the early summer, though the emergence of the highly contagious Omicron variant and fresh travel curbs slowed progress over the winter.
Over the entire year, nights spent in tourist lodgings were up 27% from 2020, but remained more than a third under pre-pandemic levels.
The southern coastal nations of Greece, Spain and Croatia led the recovery, all up more than 70%, while Austria, Latvia, and Slovakia saw tourism fall still further from pandemic lows.
Alongside Latvia and Slovakia, Eurostat found that Malta and Hungary were the most impacted by the pandemic, which slashed nights spent in tourist lodgings there by more than half.
Domestic guests made up the bulk of overnight stays at 68%, while those from other EU member states made up nearly a quarter. 

International travel was slower to recover, with nights from guests outside the bloc down to 8% over the last two years, from 18% before the pandemic hit.
Hotels and similar establishments recorded the highest drops compared to 2019, followed by rented holiday accommodation, while campsites were the least affected.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's annual retail inflation in February for a second consecutive month exceeded 6%, above the central bank's tolerance limit, while economists said policy rates were unlikely to rise soon given worries over economic recovery.
Consumer prices rose 6.07% in February, boosted by rising costs of food, fuel and household items, compared with 6.01% in the previous month, Ministry of Statistics data showed on Monday.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted annual inflation would touch 5.93%, just below the upper limit of the Reserve Bank of India's 2% to 6% target.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is worried that rising energy and other commodity prices after the Russian invasion of Ukraine last month, coupled with rupee depreciation could stoke inflationary pressures and hit recovery. 
Food prices, which contribute to nearly half of the consumer price index (CPI), climbed 5.85% year-on-year in February, compared with 5.43% a month before. 
Economists said that in contrast to the U.S. Fed and some other central banks, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was not expected to raise rates soon despite high inflation given the pressure to support economic recovery. 
Sakshi Gupta, economist at HDFC Bank said the central bank could continue to look beyond high inflation prints — viewing them as a supply side problem — in the near term and lean towards supporting growth.
""We do not expect the RBI to change its stance or policy rate at its April meeting.
RBI's monetary policy committee (MPC) will meet from April 6-8 for its next policy review. 
Economists estimated that the core inflation, excluding volatile fuel and food prices, marginally eased to 5.9% to 5.95% in February from 6% to 6.02% in the previous month. 

Warning against inflationary pressures, Michael Patra, RBI's deputy governor said last week that India's growth story remained as weak as it was during the 2013 'taper tantrum' and geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Russia were further likely to hurt a recovery.
The RBI's monetary policy committee (MPC) had left the benchmark repo rate unchanged at 4.0% last month, sticking to its accommodative policy stance to help the economy recover from the pandemic.

LONDON (Reuters) - Pet collars and casual clothing are replacing takeaway doughnuts and men's two-piece suits this year as Britain's statisticians update their inflation calculations to account for pandemic trends.
The biggest changes to the inflation basket for 2022 are around food after people ate more at home last year, and increasingly chose plant-based options. 
Vegetarian sausages, canned chickpeas, beans and lentils, dried herbs and frozen readymade Yorkshire puddings have all joined the list.
Anti-bacterial wipes are included for the first time.
The main food item leaving is the single doughnut because Britons have switched to buying multipacks of cakes and pastries to enjoy at home, rather than individual sweet bakery items to snack on while out.
The pandemic has also affected fashion.
""With many people still working from home, demand for more formal clothing has continued to decrease,"" Office for National Statistics head of economic statistics Sam Beckett said.
Women's sports bras and crop tops have been added to reflect new spending on sportswear while men's formal two-piece suits will be replaced by jackets or blazers, which are more widely stocked.
Collars for dogs and cats have been added to reflect greater pet ownership during the pandemic.
Leaving the basket are reference books such as dictionaries and road atlases as people look up similar information online, although cookery books and travel guides remain for now.
Consumer price inflation in Britain is calculated using a basket of more than 700 goods and services which are changed each year to try to keep up with new spending patterns.
With inflation at a 30-year high, the process has come under added scrutiny due to concern that product selections do not adequately reflect the spending choices of poorer people.
The ONS confirmed on Monday that it was making two changes to try to address this, in addition to the normal annual adjustments to the inflation basket.

Later this month people will be able to use a tool on the ONS website to calculate a 'personal' inflation rate that more closely matches their spending patterns.
From 2024 the ONS will include use a far wider range of prices from supermarket tills. This will make it easier to see, for example, if cheaper brands of pasta are rising in price faster or more slowly than expensive ones.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment fell more than expected in early March as gasoline prices surged to a record high in the aftermath of Russia's war against Ukraine, boosting one-year inflation expectations to the highest level since 1981.
The third straight monthly decline reported by the University of Michigan on Friday pushed consumer sentiment to its lowest level in nearly 11 years. It said 24% of respondents ""spontaneously mentioned the Ukraine invasion in response to questions about the economic outlook."" 
The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index dropped to 59.7 in the first half of this month, the lowest reading since September 2011, from a final reading of 62.8 in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 61.4. 
The survey places more emphasis on gasoline prices and the stock market. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index, which puts more weight on the labor market, remains well above its COVID-19 pandemic lows. 
Economists said the continued slump in the University of Michigan's sentiment index was overdone relative to fundamentals and they expected the economy to continue growing. 
The labor market is churning out jobs at a rapid pace, the unemployment rate is at a two-year low, wages are rising and there were 11.3 million job openings at the end of January. Consumers have amassed more than $2 trillion in excess savings.
""The relationship between spending and sentiment is loose, particularly in the short-run, and real disposable income growth and other determinants of household budgets and finances are more important,"" said Scott Hoyt, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
""Support will also be coming from plentiful jobs and abundant available cash and credit for many. The volatility of income expectations may suggest consumers are struggling to understand how labor market tightness and inflation will impact their budgets.""

Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, crude oil prices jumped more than 30%, with global benchmark Brent hitting a 2008 high at $139 a barrel, before retreating to trade around $110 a barrel on Friday. 
U.S. gasoline prices are averaging a record $4.331 per gallon compared with $3.48 a month ago, AAA data showed.
Further increases are likely after President Joe Biden on Tuesday banned imports of Russian oil into the United States, as part of a wide-ranging tough sanctions against Moscow. 
The University of Michigan survey's gauge of current economic conditions slipped to a reading of 67.8 from 68.2 in February. Its measure of consumer expectations declined to 54.4 from 59.4 in February. 
Graphic: UMich: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/zgpomzdyepd/umich.png 
The survey's one-year inflation expectations jumped to 5.4%, the highest since 1981, from 4.9% in February. But its five-year inflation expectations held steady at 3.0% for a second straight month, something likely to be welcomed by Federal Reserve officials.
The U.S. central bank is expected to start raising interest rates next Wednesday. Economists expect as many as seven rate hikes this year.

(Reuters) - Canada posted a blockbuster job gain in February, easily beating expectations and more than wiping out January's decline, while the unemployment rate dropped below its pre-pandemic level for the first time, data from Statistics Canada showed on Friday.
The economy added a net 336,600 jobs, more than double the 160,000 analysts had forecast, Statscan said. The jobless rate fell to 5.5%, its lowest level since 5.4% in May 2019, as Canada reopened from strict Omicron restrictions. 
Hours worked surged 3.6%, rising above February 2020 levels for the first time, with the average hourly wage of permanent employees up 3.3%. Overall, employment is now 1.9% above pre-pandemic levels.
""We were expecting strength, but not nearly as much as that,"" said Jimmy Jean, chief economist at Desjardins Group. 
""Canada has a history of a very resilient job market coming out of those (COVID-19) waves... You have a lot of jobs and that will allow consumers to be able to absorb the impact of higher inflation, especially with wages accelerating."" 
Graphic: Canada net jobs losses or gains by month: https://graphics.reuters.com/CANADA-ECONOMY/EMPLOYMENT/klvykbrjevg/chart.png 
The blowout gain comes as the Bank of Canada is widely expected to go ahead with second rate hike at its next meeting in April. Chances of a 50-basis-point hike edged up to 45% from 37% before the report, money market data showed.
Governor Tiff Macklem last week said the central bank has ""considerable space"" left to raise rates and did not rule out a 50 bps move if needed to curb surging consumer prices. Inflation hit a 30-year high in January at 5.1%.
While job market strength boosts the chance of a more aggressive hike going forward, it is not likely to happen in April, with too much uncertainty clouding the outlook, said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.
""I think they would need to see a little bit more clarity on the situation in Ukraine, and global financial markets in general, before they took an aggressive step,"" he said. 

""Let's just say their finger is going to be on the 50-basis-points trigger now when conditions allow.""

218,"<span>Mar 11, 2022 05:46AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - The British public's expectations for the rate of inflation in a year's time rose to the highest since 2008, although the increase in longer-term expectations has been less marked, a quarterly survey by the Bank of England showed on Friday.
The median inflation expectation for 12 months' time rose to 4.3% in February's survey from 3.2% in November, its highest since August 2008. Expectations for two- and five years' time were the highest since 2013 and 2020 at 3.2% and 3.3%.
BoE policymakers closely watch inflation expectations as they view them as a way that temporarily high inflation can become persistent through its effect on companies' pricing plans or employees' wage demands, even after the initial drivers of higher prices have faded.
However a one-off question asked in February's survey showed workers expected their pay to rise by just 2.1% over the next 12 months, far below the rate of inflation.
British consumer price inflation hit its highest in nearly 30 years in January at 5.5% due to higher energy prices and post-pandemic bottlenecks in supply chains. 
Many economists think it could exceed 8% this year and reach its highest since the early 1980s due to the further upward impact on oil and gas prices from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Other measures of inflation expectations have moved up too. 

Citi's monthly survey with polling company YouGov showed the public's expectations for inflation in five to 10 years' time rose to 4.1% last month, the joint highest since the series began in 2005, while financial markets price in the highest inflation in more than a decade.
The BoE survey took place in two waves of around 2,200 people around Feb. 4-7 and Feb. 18-21. It was conducted by polling company Ipsos, which has replaced Kantar as the survey provider.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy rebounded much more than expected in January from its coronavirus-related lull in late 2021, according to data on Friday, raising - along with soaring inflation - the likelihood of an interest rate hike next week.
The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product grew by 0.8% month-on-month in January after a 0.2% decline in December when the Omicron wave of coronavirus held back growth. This was the strongest monthly expansion since June and more than forecast by any economist in a Reuters poll which had pointed to growth of 0.2%.
All the main sectors of Britain's economy grew more than expected, with the wholesale and retail sector as well as pubs and restaurants being particular drivers, the ONS said.
While growth looked likely to continue into February, economists warned of tougher times ahead.
""The cost of living crisis and the influence of the war in Ukraine probably means this is as good as it gets for the year,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics.
Responding to the data, finance minister Rishi Sunak warned that the Russia-Ukraine conflict had raised uncertainty around the economic outlook and that it warranted vigilance.
With investors focused on the consequences of the conflict in Ukraine, the pound showed little reaction to the January growth figures.
The size of the British economy in January was 0.8% larger than its pre-pandemic level in February 2020 but remained about 4% smaller than if it had continued growing at its trend rate for the last decade, according to a Reuters calculation. 
GRAPHIC: UK economy trend https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/xmvjoewlnpr/Pasted%20image%201646984763695.png 
The ONS said output would be around 1.2% below its pre-pandemic size if extra spending on healthcare was stripped out.
Last month the Bank of England said the economy looked set to grow around 3.75% this year, with inflation peaking at around 7.25% in April - but those forecasts have already been eclipsed by the inflationary consequences of Russia's invasion of Ukraine for financial markets and international trade.
Still, the strength of the economy shown in Friday's data - in addition to galloping inflation - will likely bolster bets that BoE policymakers will raise interest rates next week for the third time in the space of three months.
The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) warned this could prove to be a mistake.
""Raising interest rates and taxes at this time would weaken the UK's growth prospects further, by undermining confidence and diminishing households' and firms' finances,"" BCC head of economics Suren Thiru said.
Britain's goods trade deficit, excluding volatile flows of precious metals, rose to its widest on record in January at 21.9 billion pounds ($28.6 billion), up from 14.7 billion pounds in December, driven by a sharp widening in the trade deficit with the EU.
Part of the increase was due to a post-Brexit change in how data on trade with the EU was collected. Around 2 billion pounds of a 3 billion pound fall in goods exports to the EU in January was a one-off effect related to this, the ONS said.
Customs officials said a 4.7 billion pound rise in imports from the EU was ""predominantly"" the result of a genuine shift, such as a 2.0 billion pound rise in imports of transport equipment - mostly cars - due to reduced domestic production.

Trade with non-EU countries was little changed from December.

WATFORD, England (Reuters) - When Zara Asamoah graduated early in the coronavirus pandemic, she had no fixed abode and her chances of finding work looked remote.
Now, thanks to an acute lack of job candidates as Britain's economy reopens and to support from Beam, a crowd-funding charity that helps homeless people into work, Asamoah has a job with a London railway operator and lives in a shared house. 
""It's taken a huge pressure off of me "" said the 25 year-old, who found it hard to apply for jobs without a stable address, and to get a home without regular income.
Globally, a shortage of people to fill jobs after the pandemic wrought changes to labour markets is worrying central banks who fear wage demands will fuel inflation already at multi-decade highs.
In Britain, the problems are exacerbated by a drop in EU workers after the country left the European Union. Vacancies are the highest on record. As a result, organizations that work with people employers were long wary of, including homeless people as well as other typically marginalised groups such as ex-offenders, say more opportunities are opening up.
Beam estimates interest from employers in its services has tripled since the start of the pandemic. It has ramped up operations to help nearly 30 people a month into jobs so far this year, compared with about 3 a month in 2019, before the pandemic.
While firm numbers of how many homeless people are now being drawn into the workplace are hard to come by, the potential pool of labour is large. 
In December, charity Shelter estimated 274,000 people were homeless in England, most of them like Asamoah crashing with friends and family, rather than sleeping rough.
VACANCIES SURGE, WORKFORCE SHRINKS
Britain's ratio of 4.1 vacancies to 100 employee jobs is a record. 
During the pandemic many older workers took early retirement and young people opted to stay in education. In late 2021, the share of 16-64 year-olds not in work and not looking for it stood at 21.2%, up from 20.2% in early 2020, government data shows, equivalent to around half a million missing workers.
Sonali Punhani, chief UK economist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), said the problem was currently even more acute in the United States, where emergency welfare payments have sidelined many workers.
But Brexit meant Britain's recovery would likely be slower. 
""Workers will come back over this year but I don't think participation will come back to pre-pandemic levels,"" Punhani said.
Emily Hocking, head of talent acquisition for buses and trains at Arriva Group, the parent of Arriva Rail London which hired Asamoah, said the situation was ""incredibly tough"" for employers.
""Brexit, COVID - it's completely changed the landscape,"" she said.
Faced with candidate shortages that were ""not sustainable,"" Arriva looked for more hires from new sources. After a successful trial between Beam and its London unit, Arriva now plans a national-level partnership.
A WEEK TURNS TO YEARS
As well as the high demand for labour, organizations such as Beam are key to breaking the cycle that keeps homeless people out of work.
Asamoah was first left without a fixed address in 2016 when her mother was evicted over rent arrears. She stayed first with her boyfriend at the time, then a family friend, then her sister, doing only occasional part-time work.
""A week turned into two weeks. Two weeks turned into a month. A month turned into a year,"" she said. ""I realized that we were just not going to get the family home back.""
Asamoah stuck to her film-making course at university despite the upheaval. After graduating in 2020, she was struggling again to find somewhere to stay when her local council put her in touch with Beam. 
Crowd-funding of just over 3,000 pounds ($3,936) got Asamoah into a shared house a year ago and covered the cost of a laptop and other expenses. Beam coached her on job interviews and introduced her to employers, including Arriva. 
Alex Stephany, Beam's founder, said companies could meet the challenge of worker shortages by doing ""the right thing for society"" and hiring ethically and diversely.
Interventions Alliance, an organisation that helps former offenders find jobs, said it was now much easier to place its clients with a wider range of companies, including transport and hospitality businesses that were previously reluctant.
""There is now much more openness,"" said Suki Binning, the group's executive director for justice and social care. 
For Fox Group, a haulage and construction firm in Blackpool, northwest England, there is potential in nearby Kirkham Prison.
A shift to online shopping in the pandemic made drivers some of the most sought-after workers, compounding the loss of about 4% of Fox's drivers and construction staff after Brexit.
Fox currently employs two former inmates of the prison and seven others who are allowed out to work during the day. In the next few weeks, Fox will open an academy to train and potentially hire 45 inmates as machinery drivers on day release and once they are fully released.

""It's a bit of a no-brainer,"" director Lee Hardy said. ""There are loads of guys out there who want to work and we've got work that we can offer.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices surged in February, forcing Americans to dig deeper to pay for rent, food and gasoline, and inflation is poised to accelerate even further as Russia's war against Ukraine drives up the costs of crude oil and other commodities.
The broad rise in prices reported by the Labor Department on Thursday led to the largest annual increase in inflation in 40 years. Inflation was already haunting the economy before Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, and could further erode President Joe Biden's popularity. 
The Federal Reserve is expected to start raising interest rates next Wednesday. With inflation nearly four times the U.S. central bank's 2% target, economists are expecting as many as seven rate hikes this year. 
Lower-income households bear the brunt of high inflation as they spend more of their income on food and gasoline. 
""Consumers' shock at rapidly rising gas prices at the pump will continue to put pressure on the Fed and policymakers to do something, anything, to slow down the speed at which prices everywhere are moving higher,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The consumer price index increased 0.8% last month after gaining 0.6% in January. A 6.6% rebound in gasoline prices accounted for almost a third of the increase in the CPI. Gasoline prices had declined 0.8% in January. Food prices jumped 1.0%, with the cost of food consumed at home soaring 1.4%. 
Prices for fruit and vegetables increased by the most since March 2010, while the rise in the cost of dairy and related products was the largest in nearly 11 years.
In the 12 months through February, the CPI shot up 7.9%, the biggest year-on-year increase since January 1982. That followed a 7.5% jump in January and was the fifth straight month of annual CPI readings north of 6%. February's increase in the CPI was in line with economists' expectations.
Last month's CPI data does not fully capture the spike in oil prices following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. Prices shot up more than 30%, with global benchmark Brent hitting a 2008 high at $139 a barrel, before retreating to trade around $112 a barrel on Thursday. 
The United States and its allies have imposed harsh sanctions on Moscow, with Biden on Tuesday banning imports of Russian oil into the United States. Russia is the world's second-largest crude oil exporter. 
U.S. gasoline prices are averaging a record $4.318 per gallon compared with $3.469 a month ago, AAA data showed.
Biden on Thursday acknowledged the hardships Americans were facing from sky-rocketing prices, but blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions.
""As I have said from the start, there will be costs at home as we impose crippling sanctions in response to Putin's unprovoked war, but Americans can know this, the costs we are imposing on Putin and his cronies are far more devastating than the costs we are facing,"" Biden said in a statement. 
Soaring inflation is wiping out wage gains. Inflation adjusted average hourly earnings fell 2.6% on a year-on-year basis in February, the Labor Department said. Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics estimates that inflation at February levels was costing the average household $296.45 per month, up from $276 in January.
Economists expect the annual CPI rate will peak above 8% in March or April and start to slow in the following months as the high readings from last spring drop out of the calculation. 
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.
SOARING RENT COSTS
Inflation was ignited by a shift in spending to goods from services during the COVID-19 pandemic and trillions of dollars in relief from the government. The resulting surge in demand ran against capacity constraints as the spread of the coronavirus pushed millions of workers out of the labor market, making it harder to move raw materials to factories and finished goods to consumers.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI increased 0.5% last month after advancing 0.6% in January.
A 0.5% rise in the cost of shelter like rental accommodation as well as hotel and motel rooms accounted for more than 40% of the increase in the so-called core CPI. The cost of rent jumped 0.6%, the most since March 2005. Rental costs are sticky and will keep core CPI hot. 
""Due to the way rents are sampled in the CPI, resampling every six months, the index tends to lag other indicators such as the Zillow Observed Rent Index, suggesting CPI rents will likely continue to rise strongly for a while yet,"" said Daniel Vernazza, chief international economist at UniCredit in London.
Consumers paid more for household furnishings and operations, motor vehicle insurance as well as clothing and personal care. Airline fares soared 5.2% as sharply declining coronavirus infections boosted demand for travel. 
But prices of new motor vehicles rose modestly while used cars and trucks fell, suggesting some easing in pent-up demand. Motor vehicles were one of the main drivers of inflation because of a global semiconductor shortage.
In the 12 months through February, the core CPI vaulted 6.4%, the largest year-on-year gain since August 1982, after increasing 6.0% in January.
Despite high inflation, tighter monetary policy and the conflict in Ukraine, a recession is not expected. Demand for labor is strong, with a near record 11.3 million job openings at the end of January. Households are sitting on about $2.6 trillion in excess savings.

""The cost to consumers is high,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""However, there are also reasons to be optimistic that consumers can weather a temporary spike in gasoline prices, as household balance sheets in aggregate are in great shape. Gasoline spending as a share of total nominal consumption is low.""

222,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 06:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s household spending fell in January, as consumers held back on spending during the rapid spread of the omicron variant and renewed restrictions on activity, adding to the risk that the economy will shrink this quarter.
Outlays fell 1.2% from December for the sixth drop in the last nine months, the ministry of internal affairs reported Friday. Spending rose 6.9% from the low levels of a year ago, compared with a 3.4% gain forecast by analysts. 
The fall in spending from last month could contribute to Japan’s recovery slipping back into reverse this quarter with the war in Ukraine adding to the uncertainties for the economic outlook. Household spending accounts for more than half of gross domestic product.
Spending dropped as virus cases shot up from around 500 a day at the beginning of January to more than 100,000 a month later, sapping momentum from a rebound in consumption in the last quarter of 2021. 
The spread of omicron prompted Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s government to bring back restrictions telling businesses to cut their operating hours and restrict alcohol sales.
The year-on-year gain shows that the hit to spending from the latest restrictions hasn’t been as big as the drop last January during the stricter curbs of a full state of emergency.
While the omicron wave seems to have peaked in February, Kishida has extended this year’s quasi-emergency measures in Tokyo and other areas into late March because the pace of the retreat has been slow. 
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“Looking forward, we expect a mild drop in 1Q GDP spending, which is a quarter-on-quarter measure. Outlays will be hit by virus curbs that were reinstated in January and have been extended into March for key areas of the country.”

He’s also been trying to speed up a third vaccine shot, which has been lagging behind other advanced nations. Less than 30% of the population has received the booster shot so far. 
Concern is mounting that escalating energy prices exacerbated by sanctions on Russia will continue to keep household consumption subdued even after omicron concerns recede. The government has responded to the increase in gasoline prices by ramping up subsidies, but speculation is emerging that more help will be rolled out. 
Around half of economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect Kishida to unveil further stimulus measures to support the economy ahead of a summer election he needs to do well in to shore up support for his leadership.
Kishida, Japan’s third premier of the pandemic, already put together a 56 trillion yen package in November to support growth.

223,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 11:51AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Inflation in Russia is forecast to accelerate to 20% and its economy could fall by as much as 8% this year, an independent survey of analysts requested by the central bank showed on Thursday. 
According to 18 economists polled by the Russian central bank between March 1 and 9, the average key rate this year is forecast at 18.9%, it said in a statement. 
""A significant revision of consensus estimates reflects a drastic change in economic conditions over the past two weeks,"" Deputy Central Bank Governor Alexei Zabotkin said in a separate statement. 
""Measures taken by the Bank of Russia and the government are aimed at limiting the scale of economic downturn and at avoiding a prolonged period of high inflation."" 

Annual consumer inflation reached 10.42% as of March 4, as the rouble touched it historic lows following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, followed by harsh Western sanctions which cut off the central bank and banks from the global financial system. 
The Russian central bank raised its key interest rate to 20% from 9.5% in an emergency move last week, introduced capital controls and told its export-focused companies to sell foreign currency as the rouble tumbled to record lows.

In the 12 months through February, the CPI shot up 7.9%, the biggest year-on-year increase since January 1982. That was the fifth straight month of annual CPI readings north of 6%. Both figures were in line with what economists polled by Reuters had forecast.

“This inflation report might be just a prelude to an even uglier report when we get the March data. Gasoline prices are up 20% since the beginning of the month. Food costs are up. Goods excluding food and energy downshifted to a slower gear in February, but food and energy will keep inflation looking really hot for at least another month. The Fed can’t bring peace to Ukraine and Russia, so there’s little that monetary policy can do to tame food and energy inflation. It may have to just say that it is serious about fighting inflation, but it is also seriously hamstrung in what it can do right now.”
 
PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“Bottom line is inflation is elevated and there’s more to come.”
“I was looking for inflation to peak in the second quarter but now that depends on oil. Perhaps we won’t see any relief until the end of the year.”
“Powell already told us we should expect a 25 basis point rate hike (this month). It should be 50 basis points or even 75 basis points but that won’t happen because of what’s happening in Ukraine right now.”

The consumer price index jumped 7.9% from a year earlier following a 7.5% annual gain in January, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The widely followed inflation gauge rose 0.8% in February from a month earlier, reflecting higher gasoline, food and shelter costs.
Follow the reaction in real time here on Bloomberg’s TOPLive blog
The median projections of economists in a Bloomberg survey called for the CPI to rise 7.9% from a year ago and 0.8% from January. 
Excluding volatile food and energy components, so-called core prices increased 0.5% from a month earlier and 6.4% from a year ago.
The data illustrate the extent to which inflation was tightening its grip on the economy before Russia’s war brought about a spike in commodities, including the highest retail gasoline price on record. Most economists had expected February would be the peak for annual inflation, but the conflict likely means even higher inflation prints in the coming months.
To combat building price pressures, the Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates next week for the first time since 2018. At the same time, the geopolitical situation adds uncertainty to the central bank’s rate hiking cycle over the coming year.
Fed officials could take a more hawkish stance if energy price shocks lead to higher and more persistent inflation, but they also may take a more cautious approach if sinking consumer sentiment and declining real wages begin to weigh on growth as the war drags on.
The February report showed that gasoline prices rose 6.6% from the prior month and accounted for almost a third of the monthly increase in the CPI. Some of that may reflect energy price spikes resulting from the first days of Russia’s invasion during the last week of the month. The impact will be more fully captured in the March CPI report. 
So far this month, the retail price of a regular-grade gasoline has increased 19.3% to $4.32 a gallon, according to American Automobile Association data.
Food prices climbed 1% from the prior month, the largest advance since April 2020, the CPI report showed.
While the war’s full impact on the U.S. economy remains unclear, soaring costs of oil, grains and metals are likely to feed through to other commodities and ultimately consumer prices. The Biden administration on Tuesday banned Russian oil imports into the U.S., a move that will add to energy price pressures.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's wholesale inflation accelerated in February at the fastest pace in roughly four decades on rising fuel costs, a sign inflationary pressures were building up even before the Ukraine crisis triggered a broad-based surge in commodity prices.
The recent war-driven spike in goods prices ranging from oil, to metals to grain will likely keep pushing up wholesale prices in a fresh hit to Japan's resource-poor economy, which is heavily reliant on imported raw material, analysts say.
""Even if the war in Ukraine ends, sanctions against Russia will remain and keep prices high mainly for fuel,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
""The rising inflationary pressure adds to pain for Japan's consumption, which was already weak compared to that of Western economies, and may delay the country's recovery,"" he said.
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge each other for their goods and services, jumped 9.3% in February from a year earlier, Bank of Japan (BOJ) data showed on Thursday, the fastest annual pace since comparable data became available in 1981.
The rise exceeded market forecasts for an 8.7% gain and accelerated from a revised 8.9% gain in January, mainly due to a 34.2% jump in fuel prices. The February index, at 110.7, was the highest level marked since 1985.
Of the total components making up the index, 67% saw prices rise in February from a year before in a sign inflationary pressure was broadening.
The war in Ukraine has led to a further spike in fuel and commodity prices, which will likely push consumer inflation closer to the BOJ's 2% target in coming months but also weigh on the country's fragile economic recovery.
Households and retailers may feel the pain of the recent rise in raw material costs throughout most of the year, as the pass-through of such price increases come with a lag.
The recent rise in wheat costs, for instance, will be reflected in domestic flour prices from July.
While raw material prices jumped 50.9% in February from a year earlier, final goods prices rose just 4.1% in a sign some firms are struggling to pass on the rapid rise in input costs.

Rising energy costs add strains to Japan's economy, which is likely to see growth grind to a halt this quarter as coronavirus curbs hurt consumption.
""Cost-push inflation will continue for the time being,"" said Toru Suehiro, senior economist at Daiwa Securities. ""There's no sign of wage inflation in Japan, which means there's a strong chance consumer sentiment will cool.""

227,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 08:10PM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - British employers' hiring of new permanent staff rose by the smallest amount for 11 months in February, reflecting a shortage of candidates, although starting salaries continued to rise rapidly, a survey showed on Thursday.
With the Bank of England worried about the labour market overheating, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) trade body and accountants KPMG said their index of permanent staff placements dropped to 65.3 in February from 66.8 in January.
But pay pressures for permanent staff rose at the second-fastest pace since the survey started in 1997.
""While recruitment activity has slowed slightly, employers across all sectors continued to hire energetically during February,"" said Claire Warnes, head of education, skills and productivity at KPMG UK.

Staff shortages and wage growth that appears to be higher than before the pandemic are part of the reason why the BoE raised interest rates in February for the second time in two months, faster than other major central banks.
The central bank thinks pressures in the labour market will stop inflation falling back fully to its 2% target unless borrowing costs rise further.

LONDON (Reuters) - House price growth in Britain hit a new eight-month high in February as the housing market showed little sign of losing momentum amid a growing cost-of-living squeeze, a survey showed on Thursday.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said a net balance of +79% of its members reported a rise in house prices in February, up from +74% in January and its highest since June. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of +73%.
The report echoed other surveys that show Britain's housing market retained much of its momentum going into 2022, despite the phasing out of temporary tax breaks on property purchases in the second half of 2021.
But with household budgets being squeezed by high inflation and imminent tax rises, RICS had doubts about whether the housing market can keep up its recent strength - even though there is scant sign of a slowdown now.
""Huge clouds of uncertainty hang over the economic prospects as energy prices continue to surge and the Bank of England grapples with how to manage monetary policy in this challenging environment,"" said Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist.
""Despite all of this, there is little evidence yet that the mood music regarding the expectations for house prices or rents is shifting.""
Expectations for house price growth in the coming 12 months were strong cross all parts of the United Kingdom, the survey showed.
Rents were expected to increase by an average 4.5% over the next 12 months. The proportion of surveyors expecting rents to rise was the highest since December 2012, RICS said.

Rubinsohn said the mismatch between strong demand and a shortage of sellers would likely keep prices high.
""The risk is that these imbalances exacerbate the cost-of-living crisis and the challenges particularly for those on lower incomes,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings fell in January, but remained near record highs as worker shortages persisted, pointing to a tight labor market that will continue to generate strong wage gains and contribute to keeping inflation high.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, dropped 185,000 to 11.263 million on the last day of January, the Labor Department said on Wednesday in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report. 
Data for December was revised higher to show a record 11.448 million job openings instead of the previously reported 10.925 million. The government revised the 2021 data.
""The labor market is tight as a drum and this means wage pressures and inflation will persist,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""Time will tell if war in Europe and plummeting stock prices will slow down the demand for new hires in the months to come.""
The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates next Wednesday to quell inflation. Economists expect as many as seven rate hikes, though much would depend on the fallout from Russia's war against Ukraine. The United States and its allies have imposed harsh sanctions on Moscow. On Tuesday, President Joe Biden banned imports of Russian oil into the United States.
The two-week war has sent prices of oil, wheat and other commodities soaring. Economists believe the excess demand for labor could provide a shield for the economy even as the Russia-Ukraine war is seen hurting business confidence. 
""The labor market still has the chance to gracefully slow down with demand cooling but not necessarily crashing,"" said Nick Bunker, economic research director for North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab. ""But so far the data on openings and turnover don't show that trend beginning.""
In January, vacancies fell in several industries, with accommodation and food services reporting a 288,000 drop. 
In the transportation, warehousing, and utilities industry, job openings fell 132,000, while unfilled positions in the federal government decreased 60,000. But job openings increased 136,000 in other services businesses. The durable goods manufacturing industry reported 85,000 more job openings. The job openings rate dipped to 7.0% from 7.1% in December.
HUGE DEMAND-SUPPLY GAP 
Hiring rose by a modest 7,000 to 6.5 million. Hiring was little changed in all industries. The hires rate was unchanged at 4.3%. The government reported last week that nonfarm payrolls increased by 678,000 in February. 
There was a 4.8 million gap between the number of job openings and the number of unemployed workers in January, accounting for 2.9% of the labor force. 
Economists view the jobs-workers gap as a better indicator of labor market tightness and wage growth. There were a record 1.8 open jobs per unemployed person in January, also underscoring tight labor market conditions. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged lawmakers to boost legal immigration.
""It is past time for Congress to act to modernize our broken immigration system,"" U.S. Chamber of Commerce Chief Policy Officer Neil Bradley said in a statement. ""We can't get inflation under control, unclog our supply chains, or fully grow our economy and remain competitive unless we welcome more people into our country to fill these jobs.""
The JOLTS report also showed the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs decreased by 151,000 to a still-high 4.3 million in January. 
Fewer people quit in retail trade and information sectors, but more left their jobs in finance and insurance. The quits rate fell to 2.8% from 3.0% in December. The revisions also showed 47.8 million quit their jobs in 2021.
""Before the pandemic, quits accounted for 50% of all job separations, on average,"" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. ""In 2021, however, they made up 70%, a sign that workers had more job security than usual and were largely the ones calling the shots."" 

The JOLTS report supported economists' view that a slowdown in wage growth in February was a fluke. Average hourly earning were unchanged last month, which lowered the annual increase in wages to 5.1% from 5.5% in January
""These data tell us far more about the labor market than does the flat reading on overall average hourly earnings for February,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.

Figures from national statistics office INEGI on Wednesday showed consumer price inflation advanced to 7.28% from 7.07% in January, a rate more than double the Bank of Mexico's target. A February reading of 7.23% had been forecast in a Reuters poll.
Core inflation, which strips out some volatile items, accelerated by nearly fourth tenths of a percentage point to 6.59%, the highest rate since mid-2001.
Bank of Mexico (Banxico) board member Jonathan Heath said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that core inflation had likely not peaked in February, forecasting it would be above 6.7% in March, and he warned that the Ukraine-Russia conflict could lift prices higher.
""High inflation will be more persistent than we had anticipated, both in Mexico and globally,"" he said.
Banxico targets inflation of 3%, with a one percentage point tolerance range above and below that. In February the bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points, a sixth consecutive rise, flagging inflation risks.
Still, Mexico's economy stagnated in the fourth quarter, and Heath last week noted that higher borrowing costs would not make recovery easier.
Capital Economics economist Nikhil Sanghani said that while Mexico is rolling out more fuel subsidies to soften the blow of soaring energy prices, higher costs for food and goods would likely push headline inflation to 7.5% in coming months.

""Against this backdrop, there is a growing chance that Banxico will increase the pace of tightening at its meeting later this month,"" Sanghani said in a research note.

According to the Rosstat data released on Wednesday, prices on nearly everything from bread to gasoline have spiked, with cost of sugar and cereals such as buckwheat - top products that Russians stockpile - showing some of the biggest increases of 20.6% and 18%, respectively. 
Yet the biggest cost rise was in construction materials such as wallpaper and bathroom tiles, with prices spiking by 22.5%, indicating an increased demand to finish renovation projects amid booming costs for imported goods as the rouble was falling. 
Annual consumer inflation reached 10.42% as of March 4, the economy ministry said separately on Wednesday, up from 9.05% as of Feb. 25. Weekly inflation rose to 2.22% from 0.45% in the preceding week. 
The Russian central bank raised its key interest rate to 20% from 9.5% in an emergency move last week, introduced capital controls and told its export-focused companies to sell foreign currency as the rouble tumbled to record lows. 

On Wednesday, the Russian parliament said it was ready to introduce proposals to regulate prices for food, medicines and other goods, with the government separately ordering the prioritisation of grain sales to domestic bakers in order to secure bread for Russians. 
Month on month, inflation was up 1.17% in February, Rosstat said. In the week to March 4, the consumer price index rose 2.22%.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian industrial output posted its steepest fall for more than a year in January, data showed on Wednesday, as the growth outlook for the euro zone's third largest economy weakens amid surging energy prices.
Industrial production declined by 3.4% from the month before, Italy's statistics bureau ISTAT reported. That followed a 1.1% drop in December and was the largest fall since September 2020. 
Italy had not posted two consecutive monthly declines since March and April 2020, at the height of its coronavirus crisis.
The data gets this year off to a weak start even before the economic headwinds generated by the rising energy costs, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Moscow by Western nations.
In a separate report, ISTAT said the recent rise in energy costs, which crimps the purchasing power of households and the competitiveness of companies, will reduce Italy's economic growth this year by around 0.7 percentage points. 
The Italian economy expanded by 6.6% in 2021 following a record contraction of 9.0% in 2020, a year hobbled by coronavirus lockdowns.
For this year Prime Minister Mario Draghi's government officially forecasts a rise in gross domestic product (GDP) of 4.7%, but the outlook has worsened significantly since that projection was made last autumn.
Draghi acknowledged this on Monday, telling reporters the geopolitical tensions linked to Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""will clearly influence economic growth this year"". 
Amid mounting signs of a slowdown, the Bank of Italy reported on Monday that bad loans at Italian banks rose in January from the month before and bank lending to firms slowed. 
Bologna-based think-tank Prometeia said after January's data it now expected a 2.2% fall in industrial output in the first quarter from the previous three months. 
That would be the first quarterly drop since the fourth quarter of 2020.

On a work-day adjusted year-on-year basis, industry output fell 2.6% in January, and ISTAT reported that it was 1.9% below the level of February 2020, before the pandemic hit the economy. 
January saw marked month-on-month falls across all the main product groups of consumer goods, investment goods, intermediate goods and energy products.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory inflation in February eased to the slowest annual pace in eight months, but analysts expect a pick-up in the coming months from surging prices of global commodities including oil, challenging policy-making to support the economy. 
The producer price index (PPI) increased 8.8% on year, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement on Wednesday, easing from 9.1% growth in January but just higher than an 8.7% rise in a Reuters poll. 
Many Chinese factories closed in the first half of February due to Lunar New Year festivities, putting a temporary leash on demand for raw materials. But the war in Ukraine that erupted late last month has since raised concerns of global supply disruptions, pushing commodity prices to decade-highs.
Month-on-month, the PPI swung to a gain from a decline in January, with international crude oil prices rising sharply and driving up prices in domestic oil-related industries, according to a separate NBS statement. Local prices of non-ferrous metals also rose. 
""We expect year-over-year PPI inflation to stay elevated in the near-term as oil and metal prices increased sequentially due to geopolitical tensions,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts wrote in a note. 
On Monday, an official at the state economic planner also said China's efforts to stabilise commodity prices face new challenges partly due to geopolitical conflicts.
China sources more than 70% of its oil and 40% of its gas from overseas even as the government races to increase domestic output. 
Persistently high oil prices prompted by Russia's attack on Ukraine could cut a full percentage point off the growth of large oil-importing developing economies including China, according to the World Bank on Tuesday.
China is targeting slower economic growth of around 5.5% in 2022 compared with last year, with the government citing headwinds at home and abroad.
POLICY
China's central bank in December cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for commercial lenders, or the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, by 50 basis points, releasing 1.2 trillion yuan ($190 billion) in long-term liquidity.
Some analysts said the scope for monetary easing may now be limited due to the threat of higher commodity prices. 
""Sanctions on Russia could axe China-Russian trade and may lead to higher imported prices,"" said Bruce Pang, Head of Macro and Strategy Research at China Renaissance Securities. 
The central bank said on Tuesday it will pay more than 1 trillion yuan in profit to the central government this year, in a bid to help support fiscal spending.
The profits come from its foreign exchange reserve operations in recent years, said the People's Bank of China (PBOC). 
""The PBOC's profit transfer is a better way to ease money supply in my opinion,"" said Tian Yun, former vice director of the Beijing Economic Operation Association. 
""The focus of the PBOC this year would be adjustments on the structure of assets and liabilities to keep a relative loose monetary policy,"" Tian said.
According to ANZ Research, the PBOC profit transfer is equivalent to a liquidity boost from an RRR cut of more than 50 basis points. 
China's consumer price index (CPI) inched up 0.9% in February, the data showed, unchanged from the growth in January and market expectations.

The Chinese government left its 2022 CPI target, unveiled on Saturday, at around 3%, unchanged from 2021. Last year, the CPI rose just 0.9%, reined in by cautious consumer spending.

Investing.com – China's factory inflation fell to the slowest annual pace in eight months in February 2022, thanks to the seasonal effects of the Lunar New Year holiday. However, investors expect it to rise in the coming months as global commodity prices also rise.
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data released earlier in the day showed that the producer price index grew 8.8% year-on-year. This was higher than the 8.7% growth predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but lower than the 9.1% growth recorded during the previous month.
The consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.6% month-on-month, higher than the 0.3% growth predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 0.4% growth recorded during the previous month. The CPI grew 0.9% year-on-year.
Consumer prices rose slightly from January due to the Lunar New Year and fluctuations in international energy prices but were generally stable compared with the same period in 2021, NBS senior statistician Dong Lijuan said in a statement. Producer prices rose from January due to the rising cost of international commodities such as crude oil and non-ferrous metals, the statement added.
The Lunar New Year holiday in February meant that many Chinese factories were closed and meant lower demand for raw materials. However, the conflict in Ukraine is raising concerns about supply disruptions, pushing energy and global commodities prices to decade-highs.
""The surge in global commodity prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine will have a much more pronounced impact on the March figures,"" Capital Economics Senior China Economist Julian Evans-Pritchard told Reuters.
China's attempts to stabilize commodity prices are facing new challenges. These include high coal, natural gas, and iron ore prices thanks to COVID-19, a monetary policy shift in big economies, and geopolitical conflicts, an official at the state economic planner said on Monday.
The scope for monetary easing may be limited due to the threat of higher commodity prices, according to some investors.
""Sanctions on Russia could axe China-Russian trade activities and may lead to higher imported prices,"" China Renaissance Securities Head of Macro and Strategy Research Bruce Pang told Reuters.
""Surging commodities prices could fuel China's PPI inflation and limit China's space of monetary easing.""
The country is targeting a 2022 CPI target of 3% on Saturday, unchanged from 2021’s target."

China only recently managed to tame surging factory prices as global supply constraints eased and the government took steps to curb commodity costs. The recent spike in global energy prices is putting renewed pressure on Chinese manufacturers, threatening to push up costs again, squeeze profits and slow economic growth further.

Producer prices rose from January due to the rising cost of international commodities such as crude oil and non-ferrous metals, she wrote.
Consumer inflation remained muted, mainly due to a further drop in pork prices. Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, slowed to 1.1% after remaining unchanged at 1.2% for three straight months. 
China is targeting full-year inflation of around 3%, a goal the state economic planner said authorities are capable and confident of achieving. The government set an ambitious economic growth target of around 5.5% for the year and signaled stronger fiscal stimulus is under way, which could drive the prices of raw materials higher.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's economic rebound was softer than initial estimates in the final quarter of 2021, revised data showed on Wednesday, as the pickup seen in consumer and business spending was weaker than first reported.
The downwardly revised growth is bad news for policymakers tasked with keeping the country's fragile recovery on track as a jump in commodity prices due to the Ukraine crisis and persistent supply disruptions heighten economic uncertainty.
Revised gross domestic product (GDP) data released by the Cabinet Office on Wednesday showed Japan expanded an annualised 4.6% in October-December. That was lower than economists' median forecast for a 5.6% gain and the preliminary reading of 5.4% released last month.
""This suggests that Japan's economic recovery from the pandemic is weaker than that of Europe and the United States,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP expanded 1.1%, falling short of the median market expectations for a 1.4% gain.
The change was mostly due to the downgrade in private consumption, a government official told a media briefing. 
Private consumption, which makes up more than a half of Japan's GDP, increased 2.4% in October-December from the previous quarter, revised down from an initially-estimated 2.7% gain. Spending in the service sector, in particular, was downgraded to a 3.1% expansion from an initial 3.5% increase.
Recent industry ministry data for December showed spending on services such as restaurants and train rides was weaker than the preliminary estimate based on private-sector figures, the official said.
""Private consumption was likely quite weak in January, due to soft spending on capital goods such as cars and services,"" said Minami, adding fresh uncertainty around Ukraine is cooling business investment.
In the fourth quarter, capital expenditure grew 0.3%, lower than economists' forecasts for a 0.7% gain and a preliminary figure of a 0.4% advance.
While data earlier this month showed robust fourth-quarter business spending, the revised GDP figures reflected weakness in items such as software investment, the official said.
Domestic demand as a whole contributed 0.9 of a percentage point to revised GDP figures, while net exports added 0.2 of a percentage point.
Economists in a Reuters poll last week forecast annualised growth of 0.4% in the January-March quarter, slashing previous projections given Omicron coronavirus variant infections and uncertainties caused by the war in Ukraine.

Yusuke Shimoda, senior economist at Japan Research Institute, said he was still expecting growth to come in positive in the first quarter.
""But we're still in early March,"" he added. ""Further downside risks can't be ruled out depending on Russia's actions.""

The consumer confidence index dropped 4.2% to 96.6 points in March,  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp. said in a statement Wednesday. That’s the weakest result since September 2020, which was also the last time the index fell below the 100, the level indicating that pessimists outnumber optimists. 
“The war in Ukraine; the floods in southeast Queensland and northern NSW; ongoing concerns about inflation and higher interest rates were all likely to impact confidence, although the size of the decline is still notable,” Westpac Chief Economist Bill Evans said.
A special question on recollections from recent news coverage showed inflation “has really exploded,” Evans said. A year ago, just 8.6% of respondents recalled news on inflation. That soared to 38.7% in March, a 14-year high, he said.
Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe earlier Wednesday acknowledged that elevated inflation was likely to be prolonged by the war in Ukraine and added that it was “plausible” that rates will rise later this year. He said the flooding in northeast Australia was likely to cause a spike in fruit and vegetable prices, though policy makers would look through the temporary increase. 
Westpac is sticking to its view that the RBA’s first rate hike will come on Aug. 2, following two more quarterly inflation reports in April and July.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit widened to a record high in January as businesses imported more goods to rebuild inventories, potentially setting up trade to remain a drag on economic growth in the first quarter.
Though inventory accumulation continues, the pace is cooling, with other data from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showing the increase in wholesale inventories in January was the smallest in six months amid a decline in motor vehicle stocks.
The reports support views of significantly slower gross domestic product growth this quarter after a robust performance in the final three months of 2021.
""This jump in the trade deficit points to a large drag on GDP growth in accounting terms and real GDP growth in the first quarter looks on track to be close to zero as strong demand gains are met by import growth rather than production increases,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economist at Brean Capital in New York.
The trade deficit surged 9.4% to an all-time high of $89.7 billion in January. Data for December was revised to show a $82.0 billion shortfall instead of the previously reported $80.7 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an $87.1 billion deficit. 
Imports increased 1.2% to $314.1 billion, also the highest on record. Goods imports surged 1.8% to an all-time high of $264.8 billion. There were record-high imports of food, capital and consumer goods. Crude oil imports increased by $935 million.
Non-petroleum imports were also the highest on record. Imports are rising as businesses continue to replenish inventories to meet strong domestic demand. 
Some of the rise in imports reflected higher prices as well as ships offloading goods after being held up at ports because of worker shortages. Imports of services fell $1.0 billion to $49.3 billion in January, pulled down by transport and travel.
Economists saw a limited impact on trade from Russia's war on Ukraine, which has resulted in the United States imposing trade sanctions on Moscow. 
Russia accounted for only 1% of imports and about 0.4% of exports last year, according to government data. 
President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced a ban on Russian oil and other energy imports, which will push up prices and further fuel inflation. According to government data, the nation imported 52 million barrels of oil from Russia in 2019, accounting for 2.2% of the total imported that year. Data for 2020 and 2022 was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The share from Russia may seem like a drop in the bucket, but Russia is still the fourth-largest foreign source of crude oil for the U.S.,"" said Shannon Seery, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in New York. ""With the relatively easy ability to ramp up production domestically the direct U.S. exposure should be fairly minimal. That said, the protest against Russian oil is sure to weigh on global supply and drive up energy costs even more than we've already seen."" 
In January, exports fell 1.7% to $224.4 billion. Goods exports decreased 1.5% to $155.9 billion. There was a decline in exports of consumer goods, including pharmaceutical preparations. But capital goods exports increased and exports of industrial supplies and materials were the highest on record.
BIG GROWTH DRAG
Exports of services dropped $1.6 billion to $68.5 billion, reflecting decreases in travel and transportation. The Russia-Ukraine war could curb travel. 
Adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit shot up to a record $118.1 billion from $111.7 billion in December. Trade has subtracted from GDP growth for six straight quarters. 
""Exports could bounce back somewhat over the remainder of the quarter, but even so, we think that the trade drag could be around 2 percentage points for the first quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
Most of the imports in January went towards replenishing inventories. In second report, the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories rose by an unrevised 0.8% in January after increasing 2.6% in December. Wholesale inventories advanced 18.1% in January on a year-on-year basis.
Inventories are a key part of gross domestic product.
Wholesale motor vehicle inventories fell 2.2% after vaulting 5.5% in December. Wholesale inventories, excluding autos, increased 1.1% in January. This component goes into the calculation of GDP.
Inventory investment accelerated at a robust seasonally adjusted annualized rate of $171.2 billion in the fourth quarter, contributing 4.90 percentage points to the quarter's 7.0% growth pace. Economists see further scope for inventories to rise as inflation-adjusted inventories remain below their pre-pandemic level. Sales-to-inventory ratios are also low.

But inventories are likely to be neutral to GDP growth this quarter as they would need to increase at a similarly fast rate as the fourth quarter to contribute to growth. In the wake of Tuesday's reports, economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) lowered their first-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 1.0% rate from a 1.5% pace.
Sales at wholesalers shot up 4.0% in January after rising 0.8% in December. At January's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.20 months to clear shelves, down from 1.24 months in December. Inventories were drawn down for three straight quarters before rebounding in the October-December period.

(Reuters) -Canada's exports edged down in January even as energy exports rose, while imports fell sharply off record highs as supply chain hiccups continued to disrupt trade patterns, official data showed on Tuesday.
Imports fell faster than exports, swinging Canada to a C$2.62 billion ($2.04 billion) surplus in January, beating analyst forecasts of C$1.60 billion, Statistics Canada said. But that win was overshadowed by disappointing exports. 
""It's not a great start to the year. I think that jumps out right away. It is a bit disappointing,"" said Stuart Bergman, interim chief economist at Export Development Canada.
Exports slipped 0.2%, with declines in 7 of 11 product sectors, led by motor vehicles and parts, and declining aircraft exports. Those declines were almost entirely offset by higher exports of energy products.
Energy exports rose 8.7% in January, led by natural gas exports, up 66.4%. Crude oil and natural gas prices rose sharply from December and have continued to surge. That should bolster Canada's trade snapshot in the coming months. 
""Looking ahead, we expect red-hot energy prices will continue to buoy exports, with minimal direct impact expected from the sanctions against Russia,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Shelly Kaushik said in a note.
Canada is the world's fourth largest oil producer and sixth largest natural gas producer.
Two-way automotive was another story, with imports of motor vehicles and parts down 13.9% and exports down 9.6%. 
""Supply chain issues continued to affect the Canadian auto industry in January, forcing most auto manufacturers to reduce production,"" Statscan said.
Overall, imports fell 7.4%, after hitting all-time highs for three consecutive months, with declines in 10 of 11 product sections. 

December's trade deficit was revised wider to C$1.58 billion from C$137 million.
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.1% lower at 1.2835 to the greenback, or 77.91 U.S. cents.

243,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 09:17AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - U.S. small business confidence fell to the lowest in over a year in February in the face of a wave of inflation that is forcing a record percentage of establishments to raise prices and denting their outlook for the economy, a survey showed on Tuesday.
The National Federation of Independent Business said its Small Business Optimism Index dropped 1.4 points to 95.7 last month from 97.1 in January. It was the lowest reading since January 2021. 
More than a quarter of businesses cited inflation as their largest problem, the highest since 1981, while a record 68% said they were pushing through price increases of their own. But higher prices weren't feeding through to bottom-line profit improvements in many cases, with a larger share of businesses reporting weaker earnings and more than 60% complaining of lost sales opportunities.
“Inflation continues to be a problem on Main Street, leading more owners to raise selling prices again in February,” said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg. “Supply chain disruptions and labor shortages also remain problems, leading to lower earnings and sales for many.”
Supply chain ructions have been a consistent issue as the economy has rebounded from the short but historically deep recession two years ago caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. With demand - for goods in particular - far outstripping supply, inflation has surged to a four-decade high.
The inflation outlook has only worsened in March, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine pushing up prices for everything from fuel to food, dashing the hopes of policymakers like those at the Federal Reserve for a leveling off in price pressures. Tuesday's survey release made no mention of the war, which started in late February.

The Fed is expected to start raising interest rates next week by at least 25 basis points to tame high inflation, but the war in eastern Europe has raised uncertainty about just how far and fast the central bank will be able to go in removing the extraordinary accommodation it put in place two years ago at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One-year U.S. inflation expectations have rocketed higher since Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the longer-term outlook has begun increasing as well, a development likely to be watched closely by the Federal Reserve as it battles to keep price pressures under control.
A new daily index released on Tuesday by the London-based ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA) showed the expected pace of consumer price increases over the next year rising from 3.5% on Feb. 1 to 5.24% as of March 7. The index is based on trading in the roughly $300 billion monthly market for inflation-protected U.S. Treasury securities and in the $100 billion monthly market for inflation swaps contracts.
Inflation anticipated over longer 10- and six-year horizons has also turned abruptly higher since the onset of the Ukraine war, with rates as of Monday around 2.43% and 2.73%, respectively, significantly above the Fed's 2% annual price increase target, the index shows. 
Graphic: ICE inflation expectations index: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/INFLATION/akvezxjwrpr/chart.png 
Longer-term inflation expectations are monitored closely by the Fed as evidence of whether its policies are keeping inflation psychology at bay. If longer-term expectations continue to rise, it would indicate a loss of confidence in the Fed's ability to control inflation - and make inflation itself harder to beat without painfully high and fast interest rate increases.
""If that number keeps going up those that are setting monetary policy will start to notice higher trend inflation expectations getting priced into the system, and that might impact decision-making,"" said IBA President Timothy Bowler, a former U.S. Treasury official.
Inflation over the next year will be ""heavily influenced by commodity prices,"" and notably oil, he said. The question facing the Fed now is whether that ""all of a sudden spills over"" into the average rates of inflation expected years ahead. 
Measuring expectations and assessing the influence of psychology on the prices set by companies and the wages accepted by workers is an often studied and highly disputed topic. Market measures, deriving inflation rates from different security sales prices, are one tool. Other measures rely on consumer or other surveys.
But however it is measured, policymakers generally feel that, as much as controlling short-term inflation outcomes, they are in the business of keeping long-run expectations stable and close to the Fed's 2% target. A key to the U.S. central bank's success in controlling inflation since the 1980s, in fact, is thought to be public trust in its ability and willingness to do so.
RATE HIKES
February was a tough month for the U.S. central bank on that front.
Headline inflation currently is far above target, and the Fed is planning to raise interest rates at its policy meeting next week and likely throughout this year, hoping to lower the headline number before expectations shift. 
The timing and pace of those increases in borrowing costs, however, have become increasingly uncertain following the invasion of Ukraine, which has produced a conflict driven oil-price shock on a par with that seen in the 1970s. That decade saw U.S. inflation become unmoored and forced the Fed to ramp up interest rates so high that it triggered a recession.
Central bankers have a noted willingness to ""look through"" what are perceived to be temporary increases in energy and commodity prices, even large ones. 
But Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers in Congress last week that the shock from Russia's military actions could be a ""game changer"" for world markets. If it leads to a steady move higher in inflation expectations, it could trigger more aggressive tightening of monetary policy.
IBA is a unit of Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE), a firm that develops and sells a variety of market analysis tools.
The inflation expectations index is being made public without charge, Bowler said, to provide a daily view of an issue that could shape central bank policy debates in coming months.
Other organizations publish inflation expectations data, such as the 10-year-ahead expectations provided daily by the St. Louis Fed. The U.S. central bank's staff in Washington combines a broader set of both household survey and market data into a single inflation expectations index, but it is only updated every three months.

Events are moving faster than that. 
Since the onset of the Ukraine war, oil prices have risen more than 25% and are likely to keep consumer inflation higher this year than otherwise might have been the case. The Consumer Price Index is already exceeding a 7% increase on an annual basis, and data due to be released on Thursday is expected to show prices up by 7.9% in February from a year earlier.

Optimism toward domestic market growth dropped 11 percentage points from the previous year, according to the Chamber's report, based on responses from more than 300 member companies. 
Businesses reported rising tensions between the U.S. and China as the top business challenge, followed by inconsistent or unclear laws.
Alan Beebe, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said in a media session there was a brief ""bump"" optimism among companies in China, following Biden's election in 2020.
""But what we’ve seen in the course of last year is that there is a new reality that has set in, where the policies and sentiment of the Trump administration remain in place with the Biden administration,"" Beebe added.
Companies also reported difficulties in hiring both foreign and local talent. 
Strict COVID-19 protocols in China make it difficult for overseas hires to begin working in China. 
Politics have also impeded domestic hiring. 
""Many Chinese talents would rather not work for an American firm. The ‘Brand America’ has started losing value because of the tensions in the [bilateral] relationship,"" one unnamed survey respondent wrote.""
Slowing economic growth has also proven a challenge both for Beijing and U.S. companies in China.

According to the survey released on Tuesday, 59% of respondents anticipate 2021 profits will be up from 2020. But that figure remains lower than pre-COVID levels. 
Despite the dour forecast and challenges, the survey revealed that most companies planned to stay, with two-thirds of them planning to increase investment in China in 2022.

Business confidence jumped to 13 points from a revised 4 in January, recording gains across all industries, a National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) Ltd. survey showed Tuesday. Business conditions -- measuring hiring, sales and profits --  climbed to 9 points from a revised 2 to be back above its long-run average. 
The poll was largely concluded before Russia invaded Ukraine, NAB said.
Australia’s economy was hit by the omicron outbreak through December-January as the country shifted to trying to live with the virus, prompting widespread sickness among employees. Still, the labor market held up relatively well through the period, with the jobless rate remaining at 4.2%.
“The employment index has improved considerably as the labor market strengthens, after the virus caused many to be unable to work due to illness or isolation requirements at the peak of the recent wave,” NAB Chief Economist Alan Oster said.
The survey underscores that the A$2.2 trillion ($1.6 trillion) economy is on a swift path to recovery, prompting financial markets to bet interest rate hikes will begin as soon as June. Data on Monday showed job vacancies are at a new pandemic-era high, signaling the labor market is poised to tighten further.
The survey showed business conditions improved across the board, with large gains in retail and transport and utilities. Forward orders, a gauge of future demand, advanced by 4 points to 9 while capex climbed by 5 points to 8. 
The survey also pointed to an inflationary impulse in the economy, with retail price growth rising above 2% in February, suggesting businesses are passing on higher costs to consumers.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan recorded its largest current account deficit since the start of 2014 in January as a jump in oil import costs offset gains in investment income, with continuing uncertainty due to the Ukraine crisis and COVID-19 pandemic.
The current account data highlighted the dependence of Japan's resource-deficient economy on imports of commodities and raw materials, which caused trade deficit to widen.
Japan, the world's third-largest economy, posted a current account deficit of 1.1887 trillion yen ($10.31 billion) in January, the data showed, versus economists' median estimate of a 880 billion yen deficit in a Reuters poll.
It was the second straight month of deficit and marked the second largest deficit under comparable data going back to 1985.
Surging fuel costs drove up the value of imports by 39.9% in January from a year earlier, outpacing a 15.2% rise in exports.
In addition, Japan's trade deficit with China widened in January. China-bound exports slowed before the Lunar New Year break while imports from the country surged due to stocking demand before the holiday period.
""Given such a temporary factor and a hefty investment income surplus, I don't think Japan's balance of payment will swing to deficit as a trend anytime soon,"" said Takashi Miwa, chief economist at Nomura Securities.
Japan earns steady and hefty return from its past investment in securities and direct investment overseas, which have replaced trade as the main driver of its current account surplus in recent years.
While a weak yen also helped inflate the cost of imports, its boost to export volumes was not as great as it once was due to an ongoing shift of exporters' production abroad, analysts say.
Underscoring changes in Japan's economic structure, a steady rise in returns from Japanese direct and portfolio investment overseas helped offset the trade deficit, bringing Japan's primary income surplus to 1.289 trillion yen in January.

The data also showed sharp declines in foreign tourist arrivals, reducing the travel account to a surplus of just 12.3 billion yen. The overall services deficit came to 737.9 billion yen, the data showed.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's bank lending rose at the slowest increase in a decade in February as immediate pressure for corporates to borrow cash continued to ease amid a broader economic recovery from the pandemic slump.
While the central bank's massive money printing will likely keep funding conditions ultra-loose, the crisis in Ukraine could hurt restaurants and retailers still reeling from the COVID-19 curbs, some analysts say.
Lending increased 0.4% in February year-on-year, the slowest pace since May 2012 and following a revised 0.5% gain in January, Bank of Japan (BOJ) data showed on Tuesday, as borrowers continued to pay back loans extended during the pandemic.
""We must keep an eye out on how developments in Ukraine could affect corporate funding through rising crude oil prices,"" a BOJ official told a briefing.
Outstanding loans held by the country's four main categories of banks, including ""shinkin"" or credit unions, stood at 580.048 trillion yen ($5.03 trillion), the BOJ data showed.
""Companies have abundant liquidity, so additional demand for funds remains subdued,"" the BOJ official said.
Lending by major banks fell 1.3% in February from a year earlier after dropping 1.0% in January, marking the biggest decline since August 2021, the data showed.
Regional banks' lending rose 1.7%, marking the smallest increase in more than a decade, the data showed.
At a policy meeting in December last year, the BOJ extended by six months a March 2022 deadline for its pandemic-relief programme to ensure commercial banks' keep channeling funds to small firms.

But it decided to phase out most other parts of the emergency funding scheme from April in a nod to sharp improvements in big firms' financial conditions.

Outbound shipments rose 16.3% in the first two months of the year from the same period a year earlier, official data showed on Monday, beating analyst expectations for a 15.0% rise, but down from 20.9% gain in December.
Imports increased 15.5%, easing from a 19.5% gain in December and below the forecast 16.5% increase.
The customs agency publishes combined January and February trade data to smooth distortions caused by the Lunar New Year, which can fall in either month.
Factory activity normally slows considerably during the long holiday as workers return to their home towns. But for the third year in a row, many factory workers did not return home because of concerns about COVID-19, which kept some factories operating.
""These numbers will probably be well received. China's exports are high and also the imports are continuing,"" said Louis Kuijs, Asia Pacific chief economist at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings, adding that exports remain one component of the economy still supporting growth.
""We need to see how long the economic impact (from the Ukraine crisis) will last. China's economy overall is big and should be to able to continue to grow even in the face of external shocks but export growth will be affected.""
China's booming exports outperformed expectations for much of last year and buoyed growth in the world's second-largest economy, but analysts expect shipments to slow eventually as overseas demand for goods eases and high costs pressure exporters.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine late last month, which it calls a ""special operation"", and mounting international sanctions against Moscow have raised fresh risks for the global economy, adding to months-long strains for China's factories from worldwide supply chain snags.
Tian Yun, former vice director of the Beijing Economic Operation Association, expects China-Europe trade may be disrupted due to the conflict in Ukraine.
""If the Ukraine crisis halts China-EU freight train services or leads to a slower operation efficiency, there will be adverse impact to EU and China's trade. This might be the biggest risk,"" Tian said.
Chinese exporters with exposure to Ukrainian markets have delayed shipments, while some factories with business in Russia have been waiting for payment from their clients before arranging the next shipments, factory officials and analysts told Reuters.
China's exports to Russia surged 41.5% in the first two months of the year, topping growth with other countries, customs data showed on Monday, while imports from Russia rose 35.8%. 
IMPORTS
Lian Weiliang, a vice head at the National Development and Reform Commission, expects the overall cost issues for importers to remain manageable despite rising energy prices driven by the Ukraine crisis.
""The source of China's crude oil and natural gas imports is diverse, with long-term contracts accounting for a large proportion of all deals,"" Lian said at a news conference. ""As long as all parties comply with the contracts, imports can remain stable.""
Analysts say higher prices for energy and agricultural products would provide a boost to the country's imports value for the months to come.
""As domestic infrastructure investment kicks in, the demand for energy commodities will continue to expand,"" said Chang Ran, senior researcher at Zhixin Investment Research Institute.

""The Russia-Ukraine conflict may cause prices of crude oil, natural gas, wheat and others to soar for a period of time. The price factor could bolster imports.""
Beijing has targeted slower economic growth of around 5.5% this year amid an uncertain global recovery and a downturn in the country's vast property sector. While that would mark a sharp slowdown in annual growth, it is nonetheless an ambitious target that would require more policy support, analysts say.

Investing.com – China’s export growth slowed down in January and February 2022 as the country celebrated the Lunar New Year holiday. Although higher than expected, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February heightened the uncertainty over the outlook for global trade in 2022.
Data released earlier in the day showed that exports grew 16.3% year-on-year. This was higher than the 15% growth predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but lower than the 20.9% growth recorded during the previous month.
Imports grew 15.5% year-on-year, down from both the 16.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 19.5% growth recorded during the previous month. The data also showed a trade balance of $115.95 billion, higher than the $99.5 billion in forecasts prepared by Investing.com, as well as the $94.46 billion figure recorded during the previous month.
The data for January and February was combined to smooth distortions caused by the Lunar New Year holiday, which can fall in either month. Factory activity normally slows down over the week-long holiday as workers journey to their hometowns. However, factories kept operating for a third consecutive year as COVID-19 concerns discouraged travel.
China’s export sector exceeded expectations for much of 2021, contributing to economic growth in that year. However, some investors warn of an eventual slowdown as overseas demand for goods eases and exporters feel the pressure from rising costs. The government on Saturday said it is targeting economic growth of “around” 5.5% in 2022 amid an uncertain global recovery and a downturn in the country's vast property sector.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 and the increasing number of Western sanctions are emerging as a headwind for the global economy. The fresh risk adds to the strain for Chinese factories, which have already felt the pressure from months-long supply chain bottlenecks.
The conflict also saw Chinese exporters with exposure to Ukrainian markets delay shipments. Other factories with business in Russia have been waiting for payment from their clients before arranging the next shipments, factory officials and analysts told Reuters."
252,"<span>Mar 06, 2022 11:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s export growth moderated in the first two months of the year, pointing to more stable global demand as multiple risks cloud the outlook.
Exports rose 16.3% in dollar terms in the January-February period from a year earlier, data from the General Administration of Customs showed Monday, beating the 14% median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Exports had increased 20.9% in December. 
Imports increased 15.5% on year during the period, below a 17% gain predicted by economists. The trade surplus came in at $116 billion. 
China’s economic activity is typically volatile in the first two months of the year due to the week-long Lunar New Year holiday. Covid outbreaks in some parts of the country also caused temporary business suspensions, although the commerce ministry has said the impact was manageable overall.  
“China’s foreign trade saw a stable start, although the current external environment for foreign trade development is more complex and uncertain,” said Li Kuiwen, spokesperson of the General Administration of Customs, according to state media CCTV.
Steel exports declined 19% to 8.23 million metric tons in the first two months of the year from the same period last year, the data showed. Crude oil imports dropped 4.9%, natural gas purchases fell 3.8% and soybean imports increased 4.1%.
Russia-Ukraine tensions and a spike in oil prices have turned the focus to energy supplies. At a separate briefing by the National Development and Reform Commission on Monday, Vice Chairman Lian Weiliang said China’s sources of crude oil, natural gas are diversified and long term contracts take a “very high” share. 
Trade Boom
Record trade last year helped to underpin China’s rapid economic growth, although momentum weakened in the latter part of the year amid a downturn in the property market. The government set a growth target of about 5.5% for this year, the lowest in more than three decades, yet above economists’ forecasts, suggesting more policy stimulus is needed, such as interest rate cuts and further loosening of property market grips.

Commerce Minister Wang Wentao warned last week of “massive pressure” in maintaining high export growth. Factors that drove overseas shipments to boom last year, such as demand for goods to control the spread of Covid, will dissipate, while firms remain squeezed by supply-chain bottlenecks, rising commodity prices and labor shortages, he said.
Both government data and a private survey of Chinese manufacturing companies showed new export orders continued to contract last month. Meanwhile, manufacturing activity in Southeast Asian nations broadly improved as virus waves ebbed in the region, a sign that production orders could be diverted away from China once again.

ROME (Reuters) - World food prices hit a record high in February, led by a surge in vegetable oils and dairy products, to post a 20.7% increase year-on-year, the U.N. food agency said on Friday.
The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index https://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 140.7 points last month against a downwardly revised 135.4 in January. That figure was previously given as 135.7.
Higher food prices have contributed to a broader surge in inflation as economies recover from the coronavirus crisis and the FAO has warned https://reut.rs/3JXHPq7 that the higher costs are putting poorer populations at risk in countries reliant on imports.
FAO economist Upali Galketi Aratchilage said concerns over crop conditions and export availabilities provided only a partial explanation to the increase in global food prices.
""A much bigger push for food price inflation comes from outside food production, particularly the energy, fertilizer and feed sectors,"" he said. ""All these factors tend to squeeze profit margins of food producers, discouraging them from investing and expanding production."" 
Data for the February report was mostly compiled before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Concerns over tensions in the Black Sea area were already weighing on agricultural markets even before the violence flared, but analysts warn a prolonged conflict could have a major impact on grain exports.
FAO said its vegetable oils index rose 8.5% month-on-month in February to chalk up another record high, propelled by rising palm, soy, and sunflower oil prices. Ukraine and Russia account for about 80% of global exports of sunflower oil.
The cereal price index rose 3.0% on the month, with maize prices up 5.1% and wheat prices increasing 2.1%, largely reflecting uncertainty about global supply flows from Black Sea ports. [GRA/]
FAO's dairy price index increased 6.4%, its sixth consecutive monthly rise, underpinned by tight global supplies, while meat prices rose 1.1% in February. 
By contrast, sugar was the sole index to post a decrease, shedding 1.9% from the previous month due partly to favourable production prospects in major exporters India and Thailand. 
FAO also issued its first projections for cereal output in 2022, seeing global wheat production rising to 790 million tonnes from 775.4 million in 2021, thanks in part to hopes of high yields and extensive planting in Canada, the United States and Asia. 
The U.N. agency cautioned however that its projections did not take into account the possible impact of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

FAO said maize outputs in Argentina and Brazil in 2022 were forecast at well above-average levels, notably in Brazil where the maize crop was seen reaching a record high 112 million tonnes. 
World cereal utilization in 2021/22 was forecast to rise 1.5% above the 2020/21 level, hitting 2.802 billion tonnes. FAO's forecast for world cereal stocks by the close of seasons in 2022 stood at 836 million tonnes.

The government of President Nicolas Maduro has been making cuts to spending in the bolivar currency since the second half of last year in an effort to stabilize the bolivar-to-dollar exchange rate and reduce inflation.
The February figure takes 12-month inflation to 340.4%, according to Reuters calculations based on central bank data. 
Inflation was down from 6.7% in January, and has not been this low since February 2014.
Despite slowing inflation, many families in the South American country struggle to make ends meet. 
Maduro on Thursday announced a jump in the monthly minimum wage to the equivalent of $29, from $1.60 previously.

Communications was the sector with the highest increase in February, at 23.1%, while education increased 17.5% compared to January.

COMMENTS:
LIZ YOUNG, HEAD OF INVESTMENT STRATEGY, SOFI
“The reaction here is that this was a strong labor report. (Fed chair) Jerome Powell this week basically said that we're at maximum employment and this further reinforces that, if not, makes it even more maximum employment.”
“It basically tells the Fed you have no excuse, aside from possible contagion risk out of Russia and Ukraine. You have no excuse not to go hard at this inflation problem.” 
JJ KINAHAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, TD AMERITRADE, CHICAGO
“If Chairman Powell were going in front of Congress again today, I don’t think he would change anything he said over the last couple of days. 
“The last couple of (unemployment) reports we've been a little bit disappointed at times with some of the numbers. This one is kind of evening out that a little bit in terms it is truly a blowout number.
“If Ukraine wasn’t out there this report would be telling us the economy is pretty red-hot. Without Ukraine there would probably be more pressure to have a 50 basis point rate hike than there will be with Ukraine.”
BRIAN JACOBSEN, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST FOR MULTI-ASSET SOLUTIONS, ALLSPRING GLOBAL INVESTMENTS (email)
    ""There’s a lot to like about the employment situation report except that wages are still falling short of consumer price increases. With higher food and fuel prices, consumer budgets will still be under pressure. Thankfully the consumer looked to be in a pretty good position going into this conflict.""
MICHAEL PEARCE, SENIOR US ECONOMIST, CAPITAL ECONOMICS
“The stronger-than-expected 678,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in February and upward revisions to previous months gains is another sign that the real economy has considerable momentum, with the Omicron wave having surprisingly little impact. That will give the Fed greater confidence to push ahead with its planned policy tightening but, with wage growth now leveling off, there is arguably less pressure for officials to front-load an aggressive series of rate hikes over the coming months.”
“The one big surprise in this report was average hourly earnings, which were unchanged in February, with the annual rate dropping to 5.1% from 5.7%. With the composition of payroll gains broad-based, most of that deceleration appears to reflect a genuine easing of pay pressures. While that might seem at odds with the falling unemployment rate, the job openings and quits rates and broader survey evidence have suggested labor shortages are leveling off a bit, which is consistent with pay growth stabilizing.”
SAM STOVALL, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH, NEW YORK
""Already there are concerns with the Ukraine crisis and this would’ve put additional pressure under the Fed to be more aggressive because of the number of jobs being added and unemployment rate coming down that could put more upward pressure on wage growth. But, because the average hourly earnings actually came in lower than expected it has caused investors to breathe a sigh of relief.""
""We have yet to see a capitulation in share prices and we will need to see that before we can say that the worst is behind us.""
""We've seen bond yields initially decline and are at 1.78% right now for the 10-year and that actually has been supportive of more of the growth oriented sectors because of the flight to safety by investors. However, because investors are gravitating towards bonds at the same time that we are seeing a surge in oil prices, rise in inflation and the expected start to a rate tightening cycle this also threatens a flattening yield curve which is usually not a good sign for the markets.”
PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“The good news is hourly wages were actually flat and up 5.1% on a yearly basis, which still high, but today’s numbers seem to be diminishing that fear of wage inflation. That’s something that the Fed is obviously look at very carefully.”
“It’s a strong report, no question about it, no further increases in hourly wages suggests wage growth that we’ve seen might be coming to a halt.”
“Unemployment was down to 3.8% and the participation rate is up a bit.”
“That question mark – where are all these people and why are they not going back to work? Now that the participation rate is going up it means people are returning to the labor force.”
“It does not change the picture for March. Even due to the current circumstances, the Fed cannot risk not raising rates. They are going to pursue a dovish hike rate this month, nothing that could come back to haunt them due to the geopolitical situation.” 
“The key now is the price of oil. If the price of oil should continue to rise, then the Fed is going to have to get more aggressive. Commodity inflation could reach a point where it could be damaging to economic growth.” 
THOMAS HAYES, CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING MEMBER, GREAT HILL CAPITAL LLC, NEW YORK
""The number is fantastic. Even manufacturing was nearly twice as good as expected, and the average weekly hours ticked up. all in all, seeing the unemployment rate drop down as well, is all positive and gives chair Powell the green light to go ahead with his 25 bps cut at the next meeting, in spite of the geopolitical headwinds. It shows that COVID is largely in the rear view mirror, the recovery is robust and as we work through geopolitical headwinds, this economy can roar.""
""The most important thing in this report is that the average hourly earnings came in much lower than expected. We're seeing the base effects start to kick in and people who are scared about inflation are going to start to see some relief in the coming months as more supply of labor comes into the market. We saw the labor force participation rate pick up, that's going to leave some of the wage price pressure and inflation numbers overall should start to improve in coming months...maybe we'll see some relief in prices and wages by summertime.""
""But the key issue the average hourly earnings, which is a relief for everyone worried about inflation. All in all recovery’s robust, COVID seems to be winding down and we're starting to get numbers that are showing inflation moderating.""
CHRIS ZACCARELLI, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, INDEPENDENT ADVISOR ALLIANCE, CHARLOTTE, NC

    ""It's a very strong report. It’s going to be overshadowed by events in Ukraine and another sign the job market is hot and that the Fed needs to move more quickly to start raising rates,""
    ""There's no doubt we've got a hot job market and high inflation. Regardless of what's happening in Ukraine, the Fed must move quickly.""

Investing.com -- The U.S. economy created far more jobs in February than expected, picking up steam again after a brief soft patch due to the winter wave of Covid-19.
The Labor Department said 678,000 nonfarm jobs were created in the month through mid-February, nearly 70% more than the 400,000 consensus forecast. The unemployment rate fell to 3.8% from 4.0% as a result and now stands at its lowest since the start of the pandemic.
However, wage growth decelerated, partially easing the pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. Average hourly earnings growth slowed to 5.1% on the year from a downwardly revised 5.5% in January. Expectations had been for an acceleration to 5.8%. Average hourly earnings tend to be highly influenced by developments in lower-paying service sector jobs. 
""After January's surprising report, today's report provides reassurance that the job market recovery remains strong,"" said Glassdoor economist Daniel Zhao via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Zhao noted that the gains were encouragingly broad-based, and that employment in professional and business services, as well as in transportation and warehousing ""are now solidly above pre-pandemic"" levels.
The numbers are likely to cement expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates later this month, validating two days of testimony in Congress by Fed Chair Jerome Powell who said that the U.S. labor market and the economy in general were strong enough to justify withdrawing the extraordinary stimulus that has been in place since the outbreak of Covid-19 two years ago.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans told CNBC that job growth ""has been good for some time now"" and repeated that ""we need to move to a more neutral monetary policy.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's jobless rate rose to 2.8% as the surge in coronavirus infections and mobility curbs hit service sector activity, although a gauge of job availability grew to a 21-month-high in January, government data showed on Friday.
The mixed data came as firms in the world's third-largest economy conclude annual labour talks, while downside pressure from record coronavirus deaths and the Ukraine crisis overshadow the recovery outlook.
""The COVID-19 outbreak continued to halt economic activity in February, partly lingering in March, which is not good for the current employment situation,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate compared with 2.7% in December, which was also the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
The number of workers stood at 66.9 million in January on a seasonally-adjusted basis, posting the first decline in three months as resignations due to unfavourable business conditions grew by 70,000.
The retail, education and transport sectors were hit hard by the Omicron variant outbreak with reinstated curbs leading to more than 100,000 jobs lost in each of those industries in January, from the same month last year.
Workers on paid furlough increased by 590,000 to a five-month-high of 2.49 million in January from the previous month, especially in hospitality businesses such as restaurants and hotels.
The jobs-to-applicants ratio was 1.20 in January, labour ministry data showed, up 0.03 point from the previous month's 1.17 and higher than a Reuters poll forecast of 1.16.
The reading was the highest since 1.31 marked in April 2020.
A health ministry official said the growth in job openings outpaced that of job-seekers in January because more companies had submitted postings data before domestic COVID-19 infections sky-rocketed later in the month.

Looking ahead, service sector jobs will bounce back as domestic coronavirus infections ease, said Shinkin's Tsunoda.

The monthly result topped the median forecast of a $3.55 billion surplus in a Reuters poll of economists, and was more than double the $1.8 billion surplus recorded in the same period a year ago.
According to the Economy Ministry, exports surged 32.6% from February 2021 to $22.9 billion, benefiting from a 22.6% expansion in volumes and a 13.5% increase in prices.
Imports rose 22.9% to $18.9 billion as a 30.9% rise in prices more than compensated for a decline of 2.5% in the volume of goods purchased by Brazil. 
In the first two months, the country's trade surplus reached $3.8 billion, jumping 125.4% from a year earlier. 

The Economy Ministry said it expected a record trade surplus of 79.4 billion this year due to a decline in imports, amid more moderate growth in global trade.
The projection, however, was made before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a conflict that is casting a shadow of uncertainty over trade between countries due to supply bottlenecks after several sanctions were imposed by Western nations on Russia.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to their lowest level this year last week, while layoffs declined sharply in February, indicating that the labor market recovery was gaining steam.
But the upbeat labor market outlook was overshadowed by a survey on Thursday showing services industry activity slowed for a third straight month in February, with a measure of employment in the sector contracting for the first time since June 2021.
According to the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), services businesses reported they were ""having significant issues with hiring both full time and contract labor,"" and that ""open positions are not being filled, and candidates are looking for more money."" Employment growth at factories also slowed last month, which poses a downside risk to job gains in February.
There were a near record 10.9 million job openings at the end of December. Economists are expecting the government's closely watched employment report on Friday will show another month of solid job growth, with the Omicron COVID-19 variant wave of infections significantly diminished.
""Workers leaving for better-paying jobs and more flexible conditions are annoying for employers, but the churn is neutral for employment on net as long as the workers find a job that satisfies their needs,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""The contraction is not encouraging, but lingering Omicron effects could have spilled into February.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 215,000 for the week ended Feb. 26, the lowest level since Jan. 1 and the second straight weekly drop, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 225,000 applications.
Unadjusted claims declined 21,285 to 194,693 last week, led by big decreases in California and Michigan, which offset a jump in filings in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
Claims could soon fall back below 200,000, a level they were last below in early December. Claims have plunged from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid edged up 2,000 to 1.476 million during the week ended Feb. 19. 
Tight labor market conditions are fueling wage growth, which is adding to inflation pressures. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday that ""the labor market is extremely tight."" 
Powell said he would support a 25-basis-point interest rate hike at the U.S. central bank's March 15-16 policy meeting and would be ""prepared to move more aggressively"" if inflation does not abate as fast as expected.
Stocks on Wall Street were mostly higher. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.
LAYOFFS TUMBLE
The ISM said on Thursday its non-manufacturing activity index fell to 56.5 in February, the lowest in a year, from 59.9 in January. 
The third straight monthly decline in the index was despite coronavirus cases decreasing substantially from mid-January. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
The bulk of the survey was likely conducted before Russia started its war against Ukraine last week, which has boosted prices of oil, wheat and other commodities.
The ISM said supply chain disruptions, capacity constraints, inflation, logistical challenges and labor shortages were affecting services businesses' ability ""to meet demand, leading to a cooling in business activity and economic growth.""
Inflation and supply constraints could worsen because of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 
""Though Europe will bear the brunt of the economic cost of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, unfavorable geopolitics in the continent threaten to exacerbate supply issues and price pressures for the U.S. services sector,"" said Bernard Yaros, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
""There will be disruptions to the transportation and logistics industries, many flights have been canceled or rerouted, leading to increased pressure on cargo capacity."" 
The survey's services industry employment gauge dropped to a 1-1/2-year low of 48.5 from 52.3 in January. It was the first contraction in the index since June 2021. Some companies in the professional, scientific and technical services industry declared that the ""Great Resignation is real."" 
Economists at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) lowered their February payrolls forecast to 375,000 from 450,000 earlier.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 400,000 jobs in February after rising 467,000 in January. The unemployment rate is forecast to fall to 3.9% from 4.0% in January. 

Hopes for a solid employment report were supported by a third report from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showing U.S.-based employers announced 15,245 job cuts in February, down 20% from January. 
Companies also announced plans to hire 215,127 workers last month, the largest February total since Challenger began tracking monthly hiring figures in 2002. That compared to the 77,630 jobs announced in January.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. services industry activity dropped to a one-year low in February and employment contracted, suggesting that a slowdown in economic growth at the end of 2021 persisted beyond the disruption from the winter wave of COVID-19 cases.
The Institute for Supply Management said on Thursday its non-manufacturing activity index fell to 56.5 last month, the lowest reading since February 2021, from 59.9 in January. 
The third straight monthly decline in the index was despite coronavirus cases, driven by the Omicron variant, decreasing substantially from mid-January. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 61. The bulk of the survey was likely conducted before Russia started its war against Ukraine last week, which has boosted prices of oil, wheat and other commodities. 
The economy hit a speed bump in December as Omicron raged across the nation. The United States is reporting an average of 61,742 new COVID-19 infections a day, a fraction of the more than 700,000 in mid-January, according to a Reuters analysis of official data.
The ISM's measure of new orders received by services businesses dropped to a reading of 56.1, also the lowest in 12 months, from 61.7 in January. Its services industry employment gauge dropped to a 1-1/2-year low of 48.5 from 52.3 in January. It was the first contraction in the index since June 2021.
The drop could be the result of worker shortages. There were a near record 10.9 million job openings at the end of December. The ADP employment report on Wednesday showed small business payrolls falling in February. Weak employment in the services sector and small business poses a risk to February's nonfarm payrolls.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, the government is likely to report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 400,000 jobs last month after rising 467,000 in January. 
A measure of order backlogs at services businesses jumped to 64.2 from 57.4 in January, mirroring a similar change in the ISM manufacturing survey published on Tuesday. 
While unfinished work indicated strong demand, it underscored the strained supply chains. The survey's measure of supplier deliveries rose to a reading of 66.2 from 65.7 in January. A reading above 50% indicates slower deliveries. 
As a result, services inflation picked up. The ISM's measure of prices paid by services industries rose to 83.1 from 82.3 in January. The Russia-Ukraine conflict is expected to further stoke inflation pressures.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday that he was ""inclined to propose and support a 25-basis-point rate hike"" at the U.S. central bank's policy meeting this month but would be ""prepared to move more aggressively"" if inflation does not abate as fast as expected.

Economists are expecting as many as seven rate hikes this year.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that factory orders rose 1.4% in January. Data for December was revised sharply higher to show orders gaining 0.7% instead of falling 0.4% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders would rebound 0.7%. 
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, is being underpinned by businesses rebuilding inventories, though tight supply chains remain a constraint. 
Supply bottlenecks could worsen after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine are producers of key materials used to manufacture semiconductors, whose scarcity around the global is hampering motor vehicle production.
In January, there were increases in orders for machinery and transportation equipment. Orders for computers and electronic products were unchanged. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components fell.
Shipments of manufactured goods increased 1.2% in January after rising 0.7% in December. Inventories at factories increased 0.7%. Unfilled orders rose 0.9% after advancing 0.8% in the prior month.

The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, increased 1.0% in January instead of 0.9% as reported last month.
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased at an unrevised 1.9% rate in January.

Nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at an unrevised 6.6% annualized rate in the last quarter, the Labor Department said in its second estimate.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected productivity would be revised slightly up to a 6.7% pace. Productivity declined at a 3.9% rate in the third quarter. 
It grew at a 1.9% pace from a year ago. Productivity has been volatile since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Hours worked rose at an unrevised 2.4% rate in the fourth quarter. 
Unit labor costs - the price of labor per single unit of output - grew at a 0.9% rate rather than the previously estimated 0.3% pace. 
They accelerated at a 10.6% pace in the third quarter. Unit labor costs rose at a 3.5% rate from a year ago. 

Despite the moderate increase in labor costs, businesses have been boosting wages as they compete for scarce workers. There were 10.9 million job openings at the end of December.
Hourly compensation jumped at a 7.5% rate in the fourth quarter, revised up from the previously estimated 6.9% pace. It grew at a 6.2% rate in the third quarter. Compensation increased at a 5.5% rate compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.

Initial unemployment claims decreased by 18,000 to 215,000 in the week ended Feb. 26, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate called for 225,000 applications in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
Continuing claims for state benefits were little changed at 1.48 million in the week ended Feb. 19.
The drop in claims is consistent with a strong labor market recovering from the omicron variant, which forced some businesses to close. The trend should continue as loosening Covid restrictions are likely to encourage Americans to go to work, and employers are keen on retaining workers as activity reignites.
The data come ahead of the government’s monthly employment report, which is currently forecast to show the U.S. added 415,000 jobs in February. A separate report Wednesday showed that U.S. companies added a greater-than-forecast 475,000 jobs last month, according to ADP Research Institute.

LONDON (Reuters) - British businesses' expectations for inflation over the next 12 months have risen to their highest in more than five years, according to a Bank of England survey that is likely to boost official concerns that soaring inflation may be slow to fall.
Businesses surveyed from Feb. 4-18 expect inflation in a year's time to be 5.0%, up from 4.3% in January's survey and matching December's reading, which was the highest since the series started in January 2017.
Looking at the three-month average for the survey, the BoE's preferred measure, expected inflation rose to 4.8%, the highest on record.
Consumer price inflation was 5.5% in December and last month, before Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices even higher, the BoE forecast it would peak at around 7.25% in April before returning to its 2% target over the next two years.
Many policymakers look at surveys of inflation expectations to get a sense of how persistent inflation is likely to be after the initial shocks driving up prices - in this case, higher energy prices and supply-chain difficulties - begin to fade.
Inflation expectations have been rising across a range of measures.
Two other surveys released on Thursday - an IHS Markit purchasing managers' index and a Confederation of British Industry poll - showed inflation pressures in the services sector were the highest since at least 1996 and 1998 respectively.
Households' long-term inflation expectations last month were the highest since 2011, and a measure of financial markets' expectations for five to 10 years ahead closed at its highest since at least 2013 on Wednesday.
The BoE has raised interest rates twice since December and financial markets expect it to raise rates again on March 17, returning Bank Rate to its pre-pandemic level of 0.75%.

Monetary Policy Committee member Catherine Mann highlighted high price and wage expectations in the BoE's last Decision Maker Panel survey as a reason why she wanted to ""front-load"" tightening, and return rates to 0.75% in February.
But others have also noted that surging energy prices will sap consumer spending power, limiting businesses' ability to pass on higher costs over the medium term.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said unemployment in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell to 6.8% of the workforce in January from 7.0% in December -- the lowest jobless rate on record in the single currency area.
Economist polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 6.9%. Eurostat said 11.225 million people were without jobs in January, down from 11.439 million the month before.
But prices at factory gates, which herald price trends for consumers, jumped 5.2% month-on-month -- more than double the market expectations -- for a record 30.6% year-on-year surge, accelerating from a 26.3% jump in December.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 27.0% year-on-year rise.
The huge increase was mainly a result of an 11.6% monthly and a 85.6% annual increase in oil and gas prices, boosted already by the very threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine before the aggression actually happened.

The producer price increase will be an additional headache for the European Central Bank because it is bound to boost consumer prices, which the bank wants to keep at 2.0%. 
Consumer inflation was already at a record 5.8% in February and economists expect it will accelerate further.

LONDON (Reuters) - Price rises in Britain's services sector last month were the most widespread in more than 25 years as businesses recovered from the Omicron wave of coronavirus cases, a survey showed on Thursday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 60.5 in February from 54.1 in January, just below an initial flash estimate of 60.8 but the highest since June.
However, the survey showed the highest reading for the proportion of firms raising prices since the series began in July 1996 - news which is likely to alarm the Bank of England as consumer price inflation approaches a 30-year high.
The broader composite PMI, which includes Tuesday's upwardly revised manufacturing PMI, rose to 59.9 from 54.2, also the highest since June 2021. Readings above 50 indicate growth.
""Although the latest set of PMI data were encouraging, the inflationary picture still has the potential to limit growth, while it remains to be seen what impact the Russian invasion of Ukraine will have on the service sector and wider economy,"" said Andrew Harker, economics director at IHS Markit.
Financial markets expect the Bank of England to raise rates later this month from 0.5% to their pre-pandemic level of 0.75%, and for rates to reach 1.5% by August.
The BoE forecast last month that inflation would peak at around 7.25% in April when regulated household energy tariffs jump by more than half. 
BoE policymaker Michael Saunders warned on Tuesday that Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the impact on energy prices risked pushing that peak even higher.

IHS Markit said around a third of companies surveyed raised their prices last month, with many reporting higher costs for staff salaries, fuel, utilities and raw materials such as food.
An index for input costs for services companies was its second-highest on record, contrasting with a fall to a 10-month low for the same measure for manufacturers earlier in the week.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's trade and current account deficits are likely to widen, putting pressure on the rupee, as global oil prices surge and the domestic economy reopens from a third wave of the pandemic, economists and analysts said.
India's trade deficit widened sharply to $21.19 billion in February compared to $17.94 billion the previous month, preliminary data showed.
""The recent increase in crude oil prices beyond $110/barrel and simultaneous revival of domestic demand pose headwinds to India's current account balance as import bill will likely remain elevated,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) economist Rahul Bajoria said.
Oil prices have hit their highest levels in almost a decade.
Indian exports dipped to $33.81 billion from $34.06 billion, while imports rose to $55.01 billion from $52.01 billion. 
Exports could dip amid global trade disruptions due to the Ukraine crisis but analysts the impact was likely to be small, with Russia accounting for just 0.8% of India's exports.
""If the slowdown in Russia's economy spills over more broadly, risks to export demand would increase,"" Nomura economists Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi wrote.
""On the flip side, higher commodity prices should help with commodity-based exports like petroleum products and metals. On balance, we believe higher commodity prices will play a key role in further widening the trade deficit,"" they said.
Emkay Global economist Madhavi Arora said the current account deficit as a proportion of gross domestic product could rise by 0.5% with each $10 barrel increase in crude prices. 
She said that with oil above $100 a barrel, the current account deficit could exceed 2.5% of GDP in 2022/23.
""A higher twin deficit, global risks and a change in risk appetite could keep the pressure on the rupee intact,"" she said.

The rupee is expected to trade in a range of 75 to 76.50 to the dollar in the near term with India's large foreign exchange reserves of nearly $633 billion providing a buffer and preventing sharp depreciation.
""While funding requirements are likely to be manageable, we think capital inflows will barely offset the increasing deficit; hence, the (balance of payment) surplus is likely to be small,"" Bajoria said.

As the Omicron coronavirus variant swept across Europe earlier this year, many governments reimposed restrictions. But most of those curbs have been eased.
IHS Markit's final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as good gauge of overall economic health, climbed to a five-month high of 55.5 in February from 52.3 in January.
However, that was below the 55.8 preliminary estimate which contained 82% of replies and was published on Feb. 21 - before the Russian invasion.
""The survey data for February depict a euro zone economy that was regaining robust growth momentum ahead of the invasion of Ukraine,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""Business activity accelerated to a pace commensurate with GDP growth in excess of 0.6%, buoyed by a relaxation of virus restrictions.""
As restrictions were eased consumers returned to restaurants, bars and other services while also buying manufactured goods, so the composite new business index climbed to 55.6 from 52.7, its highest since September.
A PMI for the services industry bounced to 55.5 from 51.1, well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction but below an initial 55.8 estimate.
Manufacturing growth in the bloc waned slightly last month but activity was still strong and supply chain constraints eased, a sister survey showed on Tuesday, although factories and consumers faced soaring prices. [EUR/PMIM]
Services firms had to bear input costs rising at the fastest rate since the survey began in mid-1998 and increased their prices at a record pace. The output prices index rose to 58.8 from 57.9.
Inflation soared to a record high 5.8% last month, official preliminary data showed on Wednesday, almost triple the European Central Bank's 2.0% target.

That will likely intensify a policy dilemma for ECB policymakers when they meet next week, needing to convey a sense of calm amid war-related market turmoil but also responding to mounting price pressures.
""With inflation risks rising and growth prospects waning, the Ukraine conflict adds to business and household headwinds for the coming months, and exacerbates the difficult juggling act of the ECB in controlling inflation while sustaining a robust economic recovery,"" Williamson said.

The composite PMI index, which covers both the services and manufacturing sectors, rose to 55.6 from 53.8 in January, the highest since last August but lower than a flash figure of 56.2.
""Another strong round of job creation across the services economy contributed to a further improvement in the overall labour market in February"" said Phil Smith, associate economics director at IHS Markit.

""However, the survey captured the mood before the escalation of the Ukraine-Russia tensions into a conflict, which brings with it downside risks to the growth outlook,"" Smith said, adding inflationary pressures are still ""uncomfortably high.""

""Confidence about the future improved,"" IHS Markit said.
However, concerns about rising operating costs and input prices persisted during the month. Most business people polled said they passed on cost increases to their customers, the survey showed.

The expansion is good news since the January contraction cast some doubt over the speed of the recovery in the first quarter of the year. Quarterly economic growth in the fourth quarter had slowed to 2% from 2.6% in the previous three months.

The trade data highlight Germany's reliance for energy on Russia, which supplies more than a third of Europe's gas.
The chief executive of German utility Uniper earlier this year pegged Russia's share of Germany's gas supply at half, although this can fluctuate from month to month.

Economy Minister Robert Habeck said on Wednesday that Germany is prepared should Russia stop exporting gas to the country, Europe's largest economy.
Germany's overall export surplus dropped by 4.2% to 172.9 billion euros in 2021 on a year earlier, the fifth consecutive year the surplus was down, the office said.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Home rents have risen to a seven-year high in Singapore, already one of the world's most expensive cities, even though the city-state's population has dipped in the past two years.
The rental price index of private residential properties increased to 114.2 in the fourth quarter of 2021, up 9.9% from the same period a year earlier, according to Singapore government data, as demand outstrips supply that has been hit by construction delays because of COVID-19 curbs.
""I need to win the lottery,"" said American Aimee Yager as she described her weeks-long house hunt in Singapore and only finding a new 4-1/2-bedroom home for her family of four after raising her monthly rental budget to about S$10,000 ($7,400). 
""We just can't afford it,"" said Yager, whose experience is echoed by confounded and frustrated tenants, both local and foreign. 
Shortages of workers and materials because of the COVID pandemic has delayed the construction of private condominiums and public Housing Development Board (HDB) apartments. At the same time, rental demand is rising, which analysts attribute to a range of factors. 
Some local Singaporeans are renting while they wait for their apartments to be completed, while high property prices have prompted some landlords to sell their units, reducing the rental stock.
Other Singaporeans returned to the country during the pandemic and repossessed homes that were previously rented out. Young Singaporean professionals are also moving out of family residences and leasing their own space to work from home.
Singaporeans Sebelle Ho and her fiance, who will marry this month, just signed a S$2,800 lease on a two-bedroom HDB apartment, where they will live while waiting for their resale public housing flat to be ready.
But Ho said her hunt for the six-month rental had ""not been easy at all,"" recalling her stress after a potential landlord pulled out of their agreement.
Singaporeans do not typically rent but live in their family home until they get married and become eligible for subsidised public housing. 
The surging property market is adding to the cost of living in Singapore, ranked by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the second-most costly city to live in along with Paris. 
Inflation has climbed to multi-year peaks this year, while fuel and electricity costs are forecast to spike further.
""If companies are recruiting or retaining expatriates in 2022, they're likely to be needing to pay higher salaries or higher overall packages,"" said Lee Quane at relocation firm ECA International.
The vacancy rate of private residential units shrank to 6% at the fourth quarter of 2021 from 7% a year ago, government data showed. Rents have also risen despite expatriates leaving Singapore amid the pandemic.
Analysts expect rents to rise 8%-12% this year, as Singapore loosens border restrictions, allowing more foreigners into the country. 
The city-state is also poised to attract workers from rival financial centre Hong Kong, which is seeing an exodus of expatriates who are unhappy with its stringent COVID prevention rules.
The hot rental streak is likely to continue for a couple of years until construction catches up, said Christine Sun at real estate consultants OrangeTee and Tie. 
Briton Arabella Lambe's family had to look for a new home after their landlord asked for a 50% increase to renew their current S$8,000 lease on a 4,500 square foot (418 square metres) house. When she saw a listing for a 3,000 square foot house in a more central part of town, she snapped it up within hours.

But the rent is still slightly more than the previous one. 
""We're moving into a smaller house. So, I'm hoping that our huge electricity bills that we've been paying are going to be reduced,"" said Lambe. ""We'll just have to sort of cut back on things.""

The precise dates of the survey, which made no mention of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, were not clear. 
Moscow calls its action in Ukraine that began on Feb. 24 ""a special military operation"". The invasion has triggered harsh economic sanctions against Moscow and the Russian central bank.
The Markit index's headline figure rose to 52.1 in February from 49.8 in January, returning above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction for the first time since September.
Employment declined in the sector for the third month and at the quickest pace since late 2020, the monthly survey showed.
But business expectations improved as companies planned to step up investment and hoped that client demand will increase.
""Although total demand remained historically subdued, firms were buoyed by efforts to invest in new product lines, as business confidence reached the highest since last September,"" said Sian Jones, a senior economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Although private sector firms were strongly upbeat regarding the outlook, imposed sanctions are expected to hamper growth potential across the Russian economy.""

Western countries have now imposed a wide range of harsh economic and financial sanctions on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, sending the rouble to record lows and paving the way for a decline in living standards.

The activity contraction highlights the challenge Japanese policymakers face in stimulating consumer spending to keep a fragile recovery on track as the Ukraine crisis and supply disruptions worsen uncertainty in the economic outlook.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 44.2 from the prior month's final of 47.6, marking the fastest rate of contraction since May 2020.
While activity stayed well below the 50-mark that separates contraction from expansion on a monthly basis, that was better than a seasonally adjusted 42.7 flash reading.
""Activity and new business declined at the sharpest pace since last August,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
Business in the sector saw overall input prices rise for the 15th straight month, citing increased fuel and raw material costs, but that did not lead them to charge more for services as the surge in coronavirus cases hit consumer demand.
""Firms made attempts to stimulate demand by engaging in price discounting measures for the first time in six months, despite a renewed acceleration in average cost burdens,"" said Bhatti.
The composite PMI, which is calculated using both manufacturing and services, fell to 45.8 from January's final of 49.9, contracting at the fastest speed in 18 months.
A separate government data showed Japan's consumer confidence index fell for a third month in February, hitting the lowest in nine months. 

""Higher COVID-19 infections...and a continuous rise in everyday goods prices influenced the consumer sentiment,"" a government official told a press briefing on Thursday, adding record-high 91.7% of consumers surveyed for the data said they expected prices to rise in one year.
The world's third-largest economy is expected to see growth grind to a near halt this quarter, likely growing an annualised 0.4%, as coronavirus curbs and supply bottlenecks weigh on overall activity, a Reuters poll showed this week.

Investing.com – China’s services sector expanded at the slowest pace in six months, a private survey showed on Thursday. The industry continues to struggle under tough containment measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 outbreaks.
The Caixin services purchasing managers index (PMI) was 50.2 in February 2022, lower than the 50.9 predicted in Investing.com forecasts and January’s 51.4 figure. The 50-mark indicates growth.
The data follows that released on Tuesday, which showed that the non-manufacturing PMI for the services sector was 51.6. The manufacturing PMI was 50.2 and the Caixin manufacturing PMI was 50.4.
Continuous outbreaks of COVID-19 in the country have left the services sector vulnerable, with numbers surging past a record 50,000 in the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong. Measures implemented to contain the cases have dampened demand in sectors such as travel.
New export business fell a second consecutive month, albeit at a slower pace. This meant another reduction of payrolls at China's services firms, but the fall was smaller.
""Demand for services contracted, while supply expanded at a limited pace. The spread of COVID-19 in several regions hurt business operations of service companies,"" Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe told Reuters.
""Policymakers should enhance support policies to encourage employment, strengthen structural support for small and mid-size enterprises and effectively reduce the tax burden and fundraising costs for companies,"" he added.
The focus is now squarely on the 13th National People’s Congress, whose fifth annual session, which begins on Mar. 5. The government will disclose the economic targets for 2022, and expectations for more stimulus measures are also growing.
The Caixin services survey also showed that inflationary pressures are starting to ease. It also showed that confidence for the year was at a three-month high as companies look towards a strong economic recovery from COVID-19."

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropped to 50.2 in February - the lowest since August and only a touch above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis - from 51.4 in January.
The softer reading contrasted with a slight pickup in the services sector growth in an official survey on Monday, although both results pointed to a still soft expansion as the industry remains vulnerable to disruptions amid China's zero-COVID approach. 
More Chinese cities are battling local COVID-19 cases in recent weeks, with infections from the city of Hong Kong surging, although the total number of cases pales in comparison with those in other countries.
A sub-index for new business in the private survey stood at 48.8 in February, the first decline since August last year, as services firms reported measures to contain COVID cases, including the travel restrictions, impacted client demand.
New export business fell for the second straight month, although at a slower pace.
That led to another reduction of payrolls at China's services firms, but the extent of decline eased.
""Demand for services contracted, while supply expanded at a limited pace. The spread of COVID-19 in several regions hurt business operations of service companies,"" said Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group.
""Policymakers should enhance support policies to encourage employment, strengthen structural support for small and mid-size enterprises and effectively reduce the tax burden and fundraising costs for companies,"" said Wang from Caixin Insight.
China's economy rebounded strongly from a pandemic-induced slump in 2020, though momentum started to flag in the summer of last year, as a debt crisis in the property market and strict anti-virus measures hit consumer confidence and spending.
Top officials have vowed to stabilise growth this year and all eyes are on the annual meeting of its top legislative body that begins on March 5 during which the government will unveil economic targets for the year and likely more stimulus measures.

The survey also showed inflationary pressures eased a bit. A sub-index for input costs stood at 52.5, compared with 54.5 the previous month, although it marked the 20-month of growth. 
Confidence towards the year ahead, however, picked up to a three-month high as firms expect a strong post-pandemic recovery.

The Confederation of British Industry said business and professional services firms were more likely to raise prices than at any time since the survey began in 1998. Consumer services companies' pricing plans were the highest since 2007.
""Rising inflation and cost pressures are hitting firms' profitability and their bottom line. The spectre of further price increases is being felt across the board,"" said Charlotte Dendy, the CBI's head of economic surveys.
The BoE has raised interest rates twice since December in a bid to stop an energy-led surge in inflation to a 30-year high from shifting businesses' pricing behaviour upwards in the long term.
Financial markets expect the central bank to raise rates again this month and for interest rates to reach 1.5% by August, up from 0.5% now.

The quarterly CBI survey, conducted from Jan. 28 to Feb. 15, showed sales growth slowed over the previous three months, when many companies were hit by the Omicron wave of coronavirus.
However, hiring and investment intentions remain strong and the businesses forecast a pick-up in business volumes over the coming quarter.

281,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 03:57PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - The U.S. economy expanded at a modest to moderate pace from mid January through mid February while inflation pressures broadened and employers continued to struggle to find workers, a Federal Reserve report showed on Wednesday.
The mixed picture illustrated in the U.S. central bank's latest survey of business contacts across the country mirrors wider economic data that showed a booming jobs market and resilient economic activity in January despite a surge in COVID-19 cases, inflation running at a 40-year high, and a scramble for workers with wages rising at the fastest pace in many years.
Worryingly, there appeared few indications that price pressures will soon ease with rising input costs felt across a range of industries.
""Prices charged to customers increased at a robust pace across the nation...firms reported they expect additional price increases over the next several months as they continue to pass on input cost increases,"" the Fed said in its survey, known as the ""Beige Book,"" which was conducted across its 12 districts through Feb. 18.
The Fed remains on track to raise interest rates from near zero, where they have been held since the onset of the pandemic, as it begins a tightening cycle to rein in inflation at its next policy meeting on March 15-16. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said earlier on Wednesday he was ""inclined to propose and support a 25-basis-point rate hike"" at that meeting but would be prepared to move more aggressively at meetings later in the year if inflation does not abate as fast as expected.
However, Powell added that the U.S. economic outlook has become highly uncertain in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and that the Fed would proceed carefully.
The Fed's latest report contained some signs that a feared wage-price spiral, where higher inflation expectations leads to accelerated wage gains, could be close at hand, although a few districts reported signs of wage growth moderation.
""Firms continued to increase compensation...with mixed success. Contacts reported they expect the tight labor market and consequent strong wage growth to continue,"" the Fed said.
The San Francisco Fed reported employers in Alaska and Utah citing candidates who missed scheduled interviews and newly hired workers who failed to show up on the first day at their new job. Many firms told the Cleveland Fed that employee turnover was high ""for various reasons, including a greater desire to work remotely, receive higher wages, change careers, or find better working conditions."" 

Elsewhere, a high-end restaurant told the Atlanta Fed it was using a new system that allowed employees to ""shift surf"" at several restaurants to match personal scheduling needs and make more money, ""which ultimately resulted in staffing shortages at some establishments.""
Among reporting districts, the overall economic outlook over the next six months remained stable and generally optimistic, although firms highlighted an elevated degree of uncertainty.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private employers hired more workers than expected in February and data for the prior month was revised sharply higher to show strong job gains instead of losses, aligning with other reports that have painted an upbeat picture of the labor market.
The ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday suggested the economy was on solid footing as the winter wave of COVID-19 infections driven by the Omicron variant was subsiding. But some economists raised concerns about the report's credibility because of the sharp upward revision to January's data.
Private payrolls increased by 475,000 jobs last month. Employers added 509,000 jobs in January rather than laying off 301,000 workers as was initially reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls rising by 388,000 jobs.
""Huge revisions undermine ADP's credibility,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""Quite frankly, with January's 301,000 reported drop revised into a 509,000 gain, the ADP figures are as much noise than signal."" 
ADP chief economist Nela Richardson, however, said revisions were part of the process, drawing parallels with the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the closely watched monthly employment report. 
""If you look over the last three months, like the November, December (data), BLS also has substantially revised their numbers over the course of 2021,"" said Richardson. ""I think what's important to remember is the overall trend. Both NER and the BLS are showing more than 6 million jobs created in 2021."" 
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics and was published ahead of the BLS' more comprehensive and closely watched employment report for February on Friday. It has a poor record predicting the private payrolls count in the BLS employment report because of methodology differences.
While the initial ADP estimate showed private payrolls fell for the first time in a year in January, the BLS reported that the private sector hired 444,000 workers, with large upward revisions to employment gains in November and December.
FEBRUARY COUNT OVERSTATED?
According to the ADP report, large companies accounted for almost all of the job gains in February, with employment at small businesses declining by 96,000, a potential red flag. 
""This segment (small businesses) is often the canary in the coal mine,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""I am not saying that we are headed to a major slowdown in job growth, or even a decline in payrolls, but it is likely the ADP report overstated the number of workers hired in February.""  
Businesses continue to report difficulties finding workers. The Federal Reserve's Beige Book report on Wednesday showed ""widespread strong demand for workers remained hampered by equally widespread reports of worker scarcity, though some districts reported scattered signs of improving labor supply.""
The report was based on information collected on or before Feb. 18. There were a near-record 10.9 million job openings at the end of December.
Tightening labor market conditions are feeding into higher inflation pressures. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday that the U.S. central bank would move forward with plans to raise interest rates this month, but Russia's war against Ukraine had made the outlook ""highly uncertain.""
Economists are expecting as many as seven rate hikes this year. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.
""We expect little fallout on the U.S. labor market, but there are major downside risks in the months ahead,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh. ""These include a recession in Europe, even higher inflation because of rising energy prices, and the increasing likelihood that the Fed could be forced to raise interest rates so aggressively to combat inflation that the recovery stalls.""
Indications are that companies maintained a strong pace of hiring in February. Data from Homebase, a payroll scheduling and tracking company, showed substantial increases in the number of employees on the job as well as hours worked in mid-February. 

According to UKG's workforce activity report, shift work in February recorded its largest monthly gain since the spring of 2020. The workforce management software company said the surge meant that the impact of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 on hourly shift work was over. 
That aligns with expectations for another month of solid employment gains in February. Nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 400,000 jobs after rising 467,000 in January, according to a Reuters survey of economists. Private payrolls are forecast to have increased by 378,000 jobs in February.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation soared to another record high last month, intensifying a policy dilemma for the European Central Bank, which will need to convey a sense of calm amid war-related market turmoil but also respond to mounting price pressures.
Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro accelerated to 5.8% from 5.1% in January, the highest figure in the bloc's two decades, beating expectations for 5.4% and also confounding the ECB's own projection for a drop, data from Eurostat showed on Wednesday.
A 32% jump in energy costs drove inflation last month but unprocessed food prices were also up sharply, rising 6.1% and making inflation especially painful for lower income families. 
But the ECB's chief economist Philip Lane called for ""tolerating a temporary increase in the inflation rate"", which was caused by a shock in the supply of fuel and other goods. 
""In the event of an adverse supply shock, the horizon over which inflation returns to the target level could be lengthened in order to avoid pronounced falls in economic activity and employment,"" Lane added. 
With energy prices soaring due to Russia's war in Ukraine, inflation will exceed 6% as soon as this month, analysts said, and even the full year average will be over 5%, more than twice the ECB's 2% target. 
As price pressures had been building for months, the ECB was all but certain to accelerate its exit from ultra easy policy at its meeting next week. But the war has thrown those plans into turmoil, leaving the policy outlook uncertain.
Still, policy hawks have not fully abandoned their calls for tighter policy as price pressures are now broad and not merely a function of a spike in oil prices.
""If price stability requires it, the ECB Governing Council must adjust its monetary policy course,"" Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel said. ""We need to keep our sights trained on the normalisation of our monetary policy.""
Nagel, however, stopped short of making the case for the ECB to curb stimulus this month.
Hawks argue that given a surge in underlying inflation, which filters out volatile fuel prices, maintaining exceptional stimulus is inappropriate.

PURCHASING POWER
The problem for the ECB is that, while war is likely to boost prices above all forecasts this year, it is a negative for both growth and inflation in the longer term, a horizon that is more relevant for the central bank. 
High energy costs sap household purchasing power, eat into corporate margins and weigh on investment. They are also likely to impact the price of other goods and services, particularly food prices, as natural gas is the biggest cost in fertiliser production. 
Meanwhile financing conditions have already tightened, mainly due to falling share prices, particularly a 25% drop in the euro zone bank index since mid-February, although there has been no broad market turmoil.
ECB board member Fabio Panetta, an outspoken policy dove, has already made the case for holding off on any further policy tightening. 
ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos, considered a centrist, acknowledged that the February inflation figure was a negative surprise but warned that war will dent growth.
""It is to be expected that the conflict through the macroeconomic channel and the channel of confidence and sentiment in the markets will end up having an impact from the point of view of higher inflation and lower economic growth"", de Guindos said.

Markets, which priced in 50 basis points of interest rate hikes this year just weeks ago, now only see around 20 basis points worth of increases. 
The ECB will next meet on March 10 and the policy decision remains wide open and subject to developments in Ukraine.

285,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 08:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. companies in February added more jobs than forecast as Covid-19 cases dropped and restrictions eased, encouraging more Americans to work.
Businesses’ payrolls rose by 475,000 last month, according to ADP Research Institute data released Wednesday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 375,000 rise. The initial January print showed a 301,000 plunge in the month, the worst since April 2020, but was revised up to a 509,000 gain.
The greater-than-expected job growth points to a labor market rebounding strongly from the omicron variant’s spread in January, which led to business closures and kept many workers at home sick. Covid-19 cases have dropped significantly and restrictions are easing across the country, which should help wary Americans get off the sidelines and back to work.
The data precede Friday’s monthly employment report from the Labor Department, which is currently forecast to show that private payrolls increased by 383,000 in February. The ADP figures don’t always follow the same pattern as the Labor Department’s data.
ADP’s payroll data represent firms employing nearly 26 million workers in the U.S.
“Last month large companies showed they are well-poised to compete with higher wages and benefit offerings, and posted the strongest reading since the early days of the pandemic recovery,” ADP Chief Economist Nela Richardson said in a statement. 
“Small companies lost ground as they continue to struggle to keep pace with the wages and benefits needed to attract a limited pool of qualified workers,” she said.
Companies with fewer than 50 employees lost 96,000 jobs in the month, while large businesses gained 552,000 jobs.
Service-provider employment rose by 417,000 in February, led by leisure and hospitality, trade and transportation and professional and business services. Payrolls at goods producers increased by 57,000.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's trade deficit widened 186% year-on-year in the first two months of the year due to a surging energy bill, data showed on Wednesday, as soaring commodities prices prompted economists to raise their current account deficit forecasts.
The trade deficit stood at $8.1 billion in February. Exports climbed 25.4% year-on-year to $20 billion and imports jumped 45.6% to $28.1 billion, mainly due to swelling energy imports, trade ministry data showed.
Trade Minister Mehmet Mus said in a televised speech that severe winter conditions coupled with the increase in energy prices caused the spike in imports.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has pushed oil prices to their highest since 2014 at more than $110 a barrel, raising risks for energy importer Turkey. Prices of grains, which Turkey imports mainly from Ukraine and Russia, have also surged.
The conflict could also slash Turkey's tourism revenues, as Ankara tries to implement President Tayyip Erdogan's new economic programme that prioritises production and exports with the aim of achieving a current account surplus.
Turkey's lira had traded broadly stable since the beginning of this year, but blew through 14 against the dollar last week due to rising tensions between Moscow and Kyiv.
It weakened 1.5% on Wednesday, before paring its losses.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a recent note that Turkey's reliance on tourism revenues from fighting parties as well as rising commodity prices is likely to lead to higher inflation, a wider current account deficit and lower economic growth.
It revised a current account deficit forecast for 2022 to 2.5% of GDP from 1.5% previously, adding that the conflict can renew pressure on the lira.
QNB Finansbank revised its 2022 current account deficit forecast up to $25 billion from a previous $10 billion. The government expects the current account to reverse course and record a surplus.

JP Morgan also doubled its current account deficit forecast to 2.2% for this year from 1.1% of GDP.
Turkey imported most from Russia, China and Germany last month. The top three destinations for Turkish exports were Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom, trade ministry data show.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity picked up more than expected in February as COVID-19 infections subsided, though hiring at factories slowed, contributing to keeping supply chains snarled and prices for inputs high.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Tuesday the outlook for manufacturing over the next two months was favorable, noting that backlog orders last month grew by the most in 11 years. Factories also reported strong order growth.
The survey was, however, conducted before last Thursday's invasion of Ukraine by Russia, which some economists say could further choke supply chains, and especially worsen the shortage of semiconductors. The conflict has caused a surge in oil and wheat prices, among other commodities. Russia and Ukraine are producers of key materials used to manufacture semiconductors.
""Falling coronavirus cases should help the domestic side of the economy improve further in the spring months, but spillover from higher energy and food prices and international shipping disruptions related to the Russia-Ukraine war are a downside risk to manufacturing near-term,"" said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica (NYSE:CMA) Bank in Toledo, Ohio. 
The ISM's index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 58.6 last month from 57.6 in January, which was the lowest since November 2020. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 58.0. 
All of the six largest manufacturing industries - transportation equipment, machinery, computer and electronic, food, chemical, as well as petroleum and coal products reported moderate-to-strong growth.
Manufacturing is regaining momentum in line with the broader economy after hitting a speed bump as coronavirus infections, driven by the Omicron variant, surged across the country. The United States is reporting an average of 69,704 new COVID-19 infections a day, a fraction of the more than 700,000 in mid-January, according to a Reuters analysis of official data.
The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index increased to 61.7 last month from 57.9 in January, which was the lowest reading since June 2020. Goods spending has surged as the pandemic curbed demand for services like travel. Even if spending reverts back to services as the health situation improves, economists expect demand for goods to remain strong.
Customer inventories have remained extremely lean for more than 60 months.
Stocks on Wall Street tumbled as the Russia-Ukraine crisis deepened. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.

HIRING SLOWS 
The survey's measure of factory employment slipped to a reading of 52.9 last month from a 10-month high of 54.5. It had increased for five straight months. According to Timothy Fiore, chair of the ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee, ""a higher-than-normal quits rate and early retirements continued.""
Manufacturers reported difficulties filling open jobs. There were a near record 10.9 million job openings across the U.S. economy at the end of December.
The ISM's gauge of unfinished work at factories rose to 65.0 from a reading of 56.4 in January. The 8.6-percentage point increase was the largest since January 2011. All of the six big manufacturing industries reported expanded backlogs. 
The order backlog index dropped 6.4 points in January, the largest decrease since April 2020. February's reversal suggested that global supply chains remained stressed. 
That was also evident in the survey's measure of supplier deliveries, which rose to 66.1 from 64.6 in January. A reading above 50% indicates slower deliveries to factories.
Makers of computer and electronic products complained that the ""electronic supply chain is still a mess."" Similar sentiments were echoed by their counterparts in the transportation equipment industry who said ""supply of transportation services continues to be a major issue for the supply chain.""
Electrical equipment, appliances and components manufacturers reported that they ""are not able to increase builds to cut into the backlog."" 
Inflation at the factory gate remained hot. The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers dipped to a still-high reading of 75.6 from 76.1 January, pointing to sustained inflation pressures. 
Inflation could accelerate in the months ahead, with Russia facing severe disruption to its exports of all commodities from oil and metals to grains after western nations imposed stiff sanctions.
""We expect the heat to remain turned up on prices for some time still amid the continued supply imbalance and higher energy and commodity costs as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Inflation was already a problem before the invasion, with annual consumer prices posting their biggest increase in 40 years in January. The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates this month. Economists are anticipating as many as seven rate hikes this year.

A separate report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed construction spending increased 1.3% in January, boosted by strong outlays on single-family homebuilding and private nonresidential structures. That followed a 0.8% rise in December.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Factories around the world sustained a brisk recovery in February amid signs the Omicron coronavirus variant was having less of an impact, but the Ukraine crisis has rapidly emerged as a risk to supply chains and is likely to exacerbate cost pressures.
Strong international sanctions against Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine have jolted markets and boosted oil prices, adding to headaches for economies and businesses already reeling from rising input costs.
""The war in Ukraine is a major new source of uncertainty,"" Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said on Tuesday after his bank kept interest rates at a record low.
Global supply chains, still not recovered from the pandemic, are now facing further disruption and cost inflation due to airspace closures which are affecting the air freight industry.
Meanwhile, a spike in commodities prices caused by the invasion is also likely to prop up inflation, already at multi-year highs in many countries, and complicate policies for central banks as they balance the need to arrest an unwelcome rise in prices and underpin growth.
""The pick-up in global inflation has been widespread and persistent and has shown few signs of having peaked,"" said Pawel Borowski, senior analyst at Fitch Ratings.
""High and rising inflation has been an enduring feature of economic recoveries in many major economies, shifting the outlook for monetary policy.""

The ECB is due to publish its latest staff projections for growth and inflation on March 10 and is widely expected to lift its forecast for price rises. 
Inflation in the bloc hit a record high 5.4% last month, preliminary official data is expected to show on Wednesday, likely adding pressure on the European Central Bank to tighten policy.
""On inflation, we expect a huge upward revision to 2022,"" noted economists at JP Morgan.
STRONG FEBRUARY
While the conflict in Ukraine poses a big risk for the global economy, indicators from February showed conditions had been robust ahead of the significant escalation in the crisis.
Data for most of the manufacturing surveys was collected before the Russian invasion. 
In the United States, the Institute for Supply Management's index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 58.6 last month from 57.6 in January. The ISM said the outlook for manufacturing for March and April was favorable, noting that backlog orders increased by the most in 11 years in February. But economists saw some risks from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 
""Falling coronavirus cases should help the domestic side of the economy improve further in the spring months, but spillover from higher energy and food prices and international shipping disruptions related to the Russia-Ukraine war are a downside risk to manufacturing near-term,"" said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica (NYSE:CMA) Bank.
The subsiding Omicron wave also boosted factory activity in Europe last month. IHS Markit's February Purchasing Managers' Index showed although momentum in euro zone manufacturing growth waned slightly last month activity was still strong as demand rose at the fastest pace in six months. [EUR/PMIM]
British factory output grew last month at the fastest rate since July, IHS Markit said. [GB/PMIM]
Chinese factory surveys, both official and private sector, also showed activity in expansionary territory, pointing to resilience in the world's second-largest economy despite cost pressures.
Despite the pick-up, China's official PMI remains well below its pre-pandemic average, said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
""The upshot is that China's economy appears to have struggled for momentum so far this year,"" he said.
Japan's factory activity growth slowed to a five-month low in February on continued COVID-19 curbs and rising input costs. Growth in activity also slowed in Taiwan and Indonesia.

""The most immediate hit from the crisis will come from rising oil prices, which will deal a severe blow to many Asian economies,"" said Toru Nishihama, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo.
""Russia is a big exporter of gas, rare metals and other goods critical for chip production. That means the crisis could aggravate supply chain disruptions, which would be bad news for countries like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.""

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that construction spending increased 1.3%. Data for December was revised higher to show construction outlays rising 0.8% instead of 0.2% as previously reported. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending gaining 0.2%. Construction spending increased 8.2% on a year-on-year basis in January. 
Spending on private construction projects shot up 1.5% in January. Outlays on residential construction increased 1.3%. 
Single-family homebuilding spending advanced 1.2%, while outlays on multi-family housing projects dipped 0.1%.
Despite January's jump, homebuilding remains constrained by higher prices for building materials, especially framing lumber. The United States last November nearly doubled the duties on imported Canadian softwood lumber after a review of its anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders.
The National Association of Homebuilders said last month that building material production bottlenecks were raising construction costs and delaying projects. 
Residential investment rebounded moderately in the fourth quarter after two straight quarterly declines.

Investment in private non-residential structures like gas and oil well drilling accelerated 1.8% in January, suggesting a rebound in spending early in the first quarter. Spending on structures fell for a third straight quarter in the October-December period.

""Growth was underpinned by a quicker expansion in output, following sharp uplifts to headcounts and supportive domestic demand conditions,"" Shreeya Patel, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement.
Demand climbed following a further relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions, IHS Markit said. Some Canadian provincial governments dialed back restrictions last month that were put in place to slow the spread of the Omicron variant.
The output index rose to 53.2 from 51.5 in January, while the measure of employment was at 54.6, up from 53.2. Still, material scarcity remained a headwind, causing lead times to lengthen.

The suppliers' delivery times index was at the fifth-lowest in the 11-year history of the survey, while measures of input and output prices edged higher.

Investing.com – Chinese factory activity recorded an unexpected expansion in February, thanks to growing new orders. However, downward pressures continue to build and the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine remains to be seen.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released on Tuesday showed that the manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was 50.2, above the 50-point mark indicating growth. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a figure of 49.9. while January’s figure was 50.1.
The economic recovery from COVID-19 had a strong start in 2020. However, the recovery started to slow down in the summer of 2021 due to a debt crisis in the property sector and strict measures to curb the spread of the virus, which hit consumer confidence and spending. The government has vowed to stabilize the recovery in 2022, and the focus is now on the 13th National People’s Congress, whose fifth annual session begins on Mar. 5.
Meanwhile, the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine will likely lead to global supply chain bottlenecks, which could add to months-long strains for Chinese factories.
However, on a positive note, the data also showed that new orders grew for the first time since August 2021 as demand improved following the Lunar New Year holidays in February. However, production growth cooled, with a sub-index standing at 50.4 compared with 50.9 in January.
""New orders returned to the expansionary territory, suggesting that manufacturing market demand has been quickly released since the holiday,"" NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe said in a statement accompanying the data’s release.
""After the Spring Festival, manufacturing activities have gradually returned to normal.""
The private Caixin manufacturing PMI was 50.4, compared to the Investing.com forecast number of 49.5 and January’s 49.1 figure. The non-manufacturing PMI for the services sector was 51.6, higher than January’s 51.1 figure.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) registered 50.2 in February, remaining above the 50-point mark, which separates growth from contraction, and picking up a touch from 50.1 in January, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Tuesday. 
Analysts had expected the PMI to ease to 49.9.
China's economy rebounded strongly from a pandemic-induced slump in 2020, though momentum started to flag in the summer of last year, as a debt crisis in the property market and strict anti-virus measures hit consumer confidence and spending.
Policymakers have vowed to stabilise growth this year and all eyes are on the annual meeting of its top legislative body that begins on March 5 during which the government will unveil economic targets for the year and likely more stimulus measures.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised fresh risks for the global economy, adding to months-long strains for China's factories from worldwide supply chain snags. 
""In February, PMI stayed above 50, reinforcing expectations that the economy is on track for a recovery, likely due to pro-growth policies rolled out by the government,"" said Zhang Liqun, analyst at China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing.
Zhang said that demand was still weak and inflationary pressures are building. ""China should continue to implement various policies to expand domestic demand and boost government investment... and to ensure the supply of raw materials and stabilise prices. ""
New orders grew for the first time since August last year, as demand improved following the Lunar New Year holidays. Sectors such as pharmaceutical, special equipment and auto industries expanded quickly last month. 
However, the growth in production slowed, with a sub-index standing at 50.4, compared with 50.9 in January. 
""New orders returned to the expansionary territory, suggesting that manufacturing market demand has been quickly released since the holiday,"" said Zhao Qinghe, senior statistician at the NBS, in a statement accompanying the data release.
""After the Spring Festival, manufacturing activities have gradually returned to normal.""
INFLATION, SUPPLY CHAIN HEADWINDS
Inflationary pressures continued to build. A gauge for raw material prices stood at the highest in four months.
A separate private PMI survey also showed China's factory activity returned to growth last month, buoyed by expanding new orders.
The property sector may provide some support this year. 
A Reuters poll showed the property market will rebound later in the year as authorities loosen some of the financing curbs on property developers and some localities relax buying requirements, bolstering buyer sentiment. China's new home prices rose for the first time in January since September
Indeed, an index of construction activity stood at 57.6 in February, up from 55.4 the previous month. 
Still, the overall momentum is hostage to persistent headwinds from various sources, some analysts say.
""The latest surveys suggest that the pace of economic growth edged up slightly in February,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics. 
""But it remains weak amid continued supply shortages, higher imported inflation and persistent disruption to services activity.""
China is still battling sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks across the country, while imported cases from Hong Kong surged. That had dented consumer sentiment. 

A survey on China's sprawling services sector on Tuesday showed growth picking up slightly in February. 
China's official composite PMI, which combined manufacturing and services, stood at 51.2 in February compared with 50.1 in January.

294,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 09:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s manufacturing activity gained in February despite holiday and virus disruptions, with sentiment among larger businesses improving while smaller firms continued to slump.
The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to 50.2, the National Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday, beating the median estimate of 49.8 in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, increased to 51.6, above the consensus forecast. The 50-level separates expansion from contraction. 
Manufacturing activity at the beginning of each year is usually distorted by the week-long Lunar New Year holidays, which fell mostly in February this year. Many businesses and factories shut down and people traveled back to their hometowns for family gatherings during the period, although virus restrictions in parts of the country prompted some to remain in the cities where they work.  
New orders picked up, while factory managers reported stronger expectations for business activity in coming months. Input and output prices also gained, suggesting inflation pressures may rise. 
The improvement in the PMI came mainly from larger businesses, with sentiment among smaller firms continuing to slump. That suggests Beijing will likely tailor its financial support toward that sector, said Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. 
“The authorities will place more emphasis on small and medium-sized enterprises in our view, so policy support will be targeted and measured through fiscal and industrial policies going forward, instead of monetary easing,” he said.
The government and central bank shifted to easing mode in the second half of last year as economic momentum faltered under a property downturn and sporadic virus outbreaks. The People’s Bank of China has cut interest rates, reduced the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve, and boosted credit expansion in the economy. 
The Politburo, the Communist Party’s top decision making body, vowed last week to strengthen macroeconomic policies to stabilize the economy this year, suggesting more support could be unveiled at the National People’s Congress that kicks off this week. 
The Caixin Manufacturing PMI, a separate private survey focused more on smaller, export-oriented businesses, also showed mild improvement in February. The index gained to 50.4, beating the median forecast of 49.1 in a Bloomberg survey of economists. 
Chinese stocks are set for their third straight day of gains on Tuesday. The benchmark CSI 300 Index rose as much as 0.8% in early trading, with consumer staples and industrial shares leading the gain.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's trade performance last quarter was much less of a drag on the economy than first thought implying upside risk for growth, even as imports outstripped exports and hefty dividend payments flowed offshore.
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday showed the current account surplus narrowed to A$12.7 billion ($9.22 billion), from A$22 billion in the third quarter.
Yet net exports trimmed only 0.2 percentage points from gross domestic product in the quarter, when analysts had looked for a 1.0 percentage point hit.
Government spending was also a minor drag in the quarter but that was more than offset by a big rise in firms' inventories, leaving analysts bullish on growth.
""Net exports represent a much smaller drag on growth in Q4 than anticipated,"" said Andrew Hanlan, a senior economist at Westpac. ""Our Q4 GDP forecast is upgraded from 2.8% qtr to 3.3%qtr.""
Figures for fourth-quarter GDP are due on Wednesday and the median forecast had already been for a hefty rise of 3% as consumer demand surged back from coronavirus lockdowns.
The brisk recovery shows every sign of continuing with retail sales jumping in January and banks reporting healthy spending on their cards through February.
That resilience supports the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) optimistic outlook on growth as it holds its monthly policy meeting on Tuesday.
The central bank is considered certain to keep interest rates at 0.1% and reiterate it will be patient on hiking as it waits for a long-desired pick up in wages growth.
RBA Governor Philip Lowe has said it was plausible a first rate rise could come later this year if the economy continues to recover, while markets are pricing in a move as early as July.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine has added geopolitical uncertainty to the mix, and combined with massive floods in New South Wales and Queensland to darken the public mood.
An ANZ survey of consumers out on Tuesday showed a sharp drop in sentiment last week, while inflation expectations ran at a seven-year high of 5.3% as petrol prices hit record peaks.
The heat also seems to be coming out of the housing market with prices in Sydney falling in February for the first time in 17 months, though the shift to the country continues apace.

Figures from property consultant CoreLogic showed national home prices rose 0.6% in February, almost half the 1.1% jump seen in January. Values in Sydney dipped 0.1% and Melbourne went flat, hurt by a rush of supply and higher mortgage rates.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's trade sector swung back to a surplus in February from a record deficit a month earlier, powered by stronger-than-expected growth in exports, but the recovery faces some risks from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
Exports in February expanded 20.6% from a year earlier to $53.91 billion, trade ministry data showed on Tuesday, beating a forecast for 18.2% growth in a Reuters' poll and faster than the 15.2% gain in January. It also marked the 16th straight month of expansion.
""Continued rise in oil prices and high semiconductor prices boosted exports growth, adding to the solid exports volume,"" said Kim Ye-in, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities.
A breakdown by items showed sales of semiconductors, the nation's top export, jumped 24% year-on-year, while those for petrochemicals, oil and steel products also surged 24.7%, 66.2% and 40.1%, respectively.
By destination, exports to China, South Korea's biggest trading partner, gained 16%, and those to the United States and European Union rose 20.9% and 8.6%, respectively.
Imports, meanwhile, jumped 25.1% in February to $53.07 billion, with those of crude oil, gas and coal totalling $12.5 billion. That brought the trade balance to a $0.84 billion surplus, after a record $4.83 billion deficit in January.
However, the outlook for the trade balance and exports may depend on the Ukraine crisis with a raft of sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of its neighbour further disrupting global supply chains.
""Price pressure on energy products will continue for the time being ... with imports value of crude oil seen growing at a solid pace,"" said Kim Yeon-jin, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities.

Western countries decided to block some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments system, which has become the principal mechanism to finance international trade, with South Korea on Monday joining the sanctions by tightening export controls.

The slower expansion in manufacturing highlights the heightened uncertainty facing the sector and the broader economy due to supply bottlenecks, higher energy prices and geopolitical tensions with Russia.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in February slipped to 52.7 on a seasonally adjusted basis.
That was weaker than a 52.9 flash estimate and the previous month's final of 55.4, and marked the slowest expansion since a 51.5 reading in September.
The 50-mark separates contraction from expansion on a monthly basis.
""Significant supply chain disruption which dampened output and demand in the latest survey period was attributed to severe material shortages and delivery delays,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
Manufacturers' input prices rose for the 21st straight month due to rising material prices, mainly because of higher cost of electronics and fuel, the survey showed.
""Input price pressures intensified further, with average cost burdens rising at the sharpest pace in thirteen-and-a-half years,"" said Bhatti.

""Firms doubled down on efforts to protect against future disruption and price pressures by raising safety stocks of raw materials and other inputs at the quickest pace in the history of the survey,"" he added.
Japan's economy is expected to grow at an annualised rate of just 0.4% in the current quarter as the pandemic and supply bottlenecks hamper a stronger economic recovery, a Reuters poll showed on Monday.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian home prices extended their long ascent in February, though Sydney saw the first dip in 17 months as a rush of supply, rising mortgage rates and stretched affordability cooled the market.
Figures from property consultant CoreLogic out on Tuesday showed national home prices rose 0.6% in February from January, when they increased 1.1%.
Prices in the major cities edged up only 0.3%, while the regions gained 1.6% amid a pandemic-induced rush to greener pastures.
""Demographic tailwinds, low inventory levels and ongoing demand for coastal or treechange housing options are continuing to support strong upwards price pressures across regional housing markets,"" said CoreLogic's research director, Tim Lawless.
National prices were up 20.6% for the year, with the median home worth A$728,034. The same home in Sydney is priced at A$1.1 million ($798,600.00), a major reason the market there has been slowing.
Values in Sydney actually fell 0.1% in February, while Melbourne was flat and Perth added 0.4%. Brisbane fared better with a rise of 1.8%, while Adelaide gained 1.5%.
The long boom in prices has been a windfall for household wealth and consumer confidence. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates the value of the housing stock surged by a trillion dollars in the six months to September to reach A$9.3 trillion ($6.57 trillion).
Yet regulators have become concerned by the rapid growth in housing debt and tightened some lending rules last year.
Rates for fixed mortgages have also been rising along with government bond yields as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) flagged a possible rise in interest rates later this year.

The central bank holds a policy meeting on Tuesday and is expected to be patient for now amid geopolitical uncertainty and the lingering drag of the coronavirus.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit in goods widened sharply to a record high in January amid an increase in imports as businesses continued to replenish depleted inventories.
The pace of inventory accumulation reported by the Commerce Department on Monday was, however, slower than in recent months. That, together with the surge in the goods trade deficit, prompted economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to lower their gross domestic product growth estimate for the first quarter by 0.5 percentage point to a 1.5% annualized rate.
The economy grew at a 7.0% pace in the fourth quarter, with inventories contributing a whopping 4.90 percentage points.
""We remain on track for another strong gain in real business inventories in the first quarter, although inventories may end being fairly close to a neutral factor for GDP growth considering that the fourth quarter buildup of inventories also was substantial,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
The goods trade deficit jumped 7.1% to an all-time high of $107.6 billion last month. Imports of goods increased 1.7%, led by food and motor vehicles. There were also large increases in imports of industrial supplies, capital and consumer goods. Imports of other goods, however, tumbled 15.3%.
Exports dropped 1.8%, weighed down by consumer goods, motor vehicles, food and other goods. But exports of capital goods and industrial supplies increased.
Trade has been a drag on gross domestic product for six straight quarters. Economists saw a limited impact on trade from the Russian-Ukraine conflict, which has resulted in the United States imposing same trade sanctions on Moscow. Russia accounted for only 1% of imports and about 0.4% of exports last year, according to government data.
""While the Russian invasion of Ukraine is driving a sharp increase in energy prices, its implications for trade flows will be less noticeable,"" said Mahir Rasheed, an economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Russia and Ukraine make up less than 1% of monthly import volumes and an even smaller share of U.S. exports, so the war has little bearing on the trade outlook.""
U.S. stocks were trading lower as investors assessed the fallout from a raft of sanctions imposed by Western countries on Russia. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.
INVENTORIES RISING 
The increase in imports last month largely reflected the rebuilding of inventories. Stocks at wholesalers increased 0.8% after climbing 2.3% in December. Inventories of durable goods, items which are meant to last three year and longer, rose 1.0%, while stocks of wholesale nondurable goods climbed 0.5%. 
Retail inventories rose 1.9% after jumping 4.7% in December. They were lifted by a 2.4% increase in motor vehicles, which followed a 7.0% surge in December. 
Motor vehicle production remains constrained by a global semiconductor shortage. Excluding motor vehicles, retail inventories gained 1.7% after advancing 3.9% in December. This component goes into the calculation of GDP growth.
Inventory investment increased at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of $171.2 billion in the fourth quarter, one of the largest in years. Growth estimates for the first quarter range from as low as a 0.6% rate to as high as a 5.4% pace.
""Because of the way GDP is calculated, it would require a similarly sized expansion in inventories to contribute that level of growth,"" said Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""We do not expect the build in the first quarter to exceed the record-breaking fourth-quarter build. As a result, we expect inventories to subtract 0.3 percentage point off GDP growth."" 
Most economists see further scope for inventories to rise, noting that inflation-adjusted inventories remain below their pre-pandemic level. Inventory-to-sales ratios are also low.
Restocking, after three straight quarters during which inventories were drawn down, is supporting manufacturing.
A survey from the Dallas Federal Reserve on Monday showed factory activity in Texas continued to expand in February, though at a slightly slower pace. The survey's production index, a key measure of state manufacturing conditions, dipped two points to a reading of 14.5. 

A reading above zero indicates growth in manufacturing in the region. Despite the moderation in activity, factories reported strong growth in new orders and were upbeat about business conditions. The survey's general business activity index shot up 12 points to a reading of 14.0. 
""The manufacturing sector continues to expand in spite of supply network dislocations and input shortages,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.

LONDON (Reuters) -The British public's expectations for inflation over the next five to 10 years hit a joint record high in February, according to a survey that is likely to strengthen the Bank of England's intention to raise interest rates further in the coming months.
U.S. bank Citi and polling firm YouGov said their gauge of expectations for inflation in five to 10 years' time rose to 4.1% from 3.8% in January, equalling a record high struck in June 2011.
With inflation surging to its highest levels since the early 1990s, the BoE is worried that expectations for rapidly rising prices will become engrained and make it harder for it to return inflation to its 2% target once the immediate price shock has passed.
The BoE raised interest rates on Feb. 3 for the second time in two months and warned further modest tightening would be needed in the coming months to bring inflation back to its 2% target in the next two to three years.
Monday's survey showed public inflation expectations for the coming 12 months hit an outright record of 5.6% from 4.8% in January.
""Today's data, especially the level of long-term expectations, suggest a growing risk that expectations could become de-anchored,"" said Citi economist Benjamin Nabarro, adding that this was still not his base case.
""However, these risks do now merit particular vigilance as CPI inflation exceeds 8% in the months ahead. For the (BoE), these data - alongside recent developments - may increase the risk of an outsized move in Bank Rate in March.""

Financial markets expect the BoE to increase rates to 0.75% from 0.5% this month, and for rates to reach 1.5% by August, but before Russia's invasion of Ukraine investors saw a strong chance of a half-point rate rise in March.
The Citi/YouGov survey, which dates back to 2005, polled 2,076 people between Feb. 22 and Feb. 23.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) is expected to ease to 49.9 in February, its lowest reading in four months, from 50.1 in January, according to the median forecast of 35 economists polled by Reuters on Monday. A reading below the 50-point mark indicates a contraction from the previous month.
""Apart from seasonality impact from Lunar New Year timing shifts, production curbs during the Winter Olympics and still-subdued property sector activity likely weighed on upstream demand,"" analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note on Friday. They expect National Bureau of Statistics manufacturing PMI to have slipped to 49.6.
The week-long Lunar New Year holidays began at the end of January and the Beijing Winter Olympics took place from Feb. 4-20. 
However, Capital Economics expects some upside surprise to the data, citing loosened COVID-19 restrictions as outbreaks were contained. 
""Early indicators suggest that conditions improved in February. Most localised restrictions on industrial areas and port cities were lifted thanks to fewer outbreaks this month compared to January.""
China's economy started last year on a strong footing, rebounding from a pandemic-induced slump the previous year. Momentum started to flag in the summer, however, weighed down by debt problems in the property market and strict anti-virus measures that hit consumer confidence and spending.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output shrank for the second month in January as the auto sector grappled with production suspensions due to the pandemic, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine intensifying pressure on an economy facing the risk of a contraction. 
Even before the Ukraine crisis erupted, factories in the world's third-largest economy were struggling with global parts supply disruptions and coronavirus infections of the Omicron variant at home.
""Car output decreased substantially due to a worsening chip shortage and supply bottlenecks,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""That spilled over (into other industries such as) steel, which also fell.""
Factory output slumped 1.3% in January from the previous month, official data showed on Monday, hurt by falling production of cars as well as declining iron, steel and non-ferrous metals.
That meant output extended declines to a second month, after slipping 1.0% in December, and came in weaker than a 0.7% loss forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
Japanese car producers including  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Suzuki Motor Corp have faced output cuts after being hit by supply chain disruptions and seeing pressure from a record surge in COVID-19 infections at home.
Monday's data showed output of cars and other motor vehicles slumped 17.2% from the previous month in January, falling for the first time in four months and pulling down the headline output figure by nearly 2.7 percentage points.
DOWNSIDE RISKS
Complications from the Ukraine crisis posed serious downside risks to Japan's output and broader economy, Minami added, saying output could be curbed if the conflict triggers a global commodity and energy shortage.
""The longer the war between Ukraine and Russia lasts, the stronger sanctions are likely to become,"" he said. ""It depends how far things will go.""
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expected output to advance 5.7% in February and 0.1% in March. A government official said those forecasts were taken as of Feb. 10, and did not reflect Russia's invasion of the Ukraine.
Separate data showed retail sales expanded for the fourth consecutive month from a year earlier in January, rising 1.6% due in part to a flattered comparison to last year's low levels. That compared to a median market forecast for a 1.4% gain.
But retail sales dropped a seasonally adjusted 1.9% from the prior month, the second monthly downturn in a sign of the negative impact a surge of coronavirus infections was having on momentum.

""The falls in both retail sales and industrial production in January confirm that the Omicron surge has knocked back the recovery,"" Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.
""We think consumer spending will fall across this quarter, but it should rebound sharply in Q2.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retail sales were surprisingly strong in January as shoppers weathered a surge in Omicron cases with aplomb, suggesting the economy maintained considerable momentum into the new year. 
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Monday showed retail sales climbed 1.8% in January to A$32.5 billion ($23.3 billion), the second highest level on record and easily beating forecasts of a 0.4% gain. 
That followed a 4.4% drop in December, which was distorted by the popularity of online sales that had pulled spending into November. 
Weekly figures from banks on card spending show activity was been quick to revive once coronavirus cases began to tail off in mid-January and is now running well above the levels of a year ago.
""With new virus cases now only a quarter of their mid-January peak, AppleMaps routing requests are now well above their 2020 levels and the number of visitors at retail & recreation facilities has rebounded, too,"" said Marcel Thieliant, a senior economist at Capital Economics.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting spike in commodity prices has added a fresh layer of uncertainty to the outlook, though so far the impact on Australia has been minor.
""Australia's trading relationship with Russia and Ukraine is negligible,"" said Gareth Aird, head of Australian economics at CBA. ""It is our expectation the economy will largely be insulated provided the major military powers in Europe and the U.S. do not fight Russia in Ukraine or elsewhere.""
Higher petrol prices could act as a tax on consumers, while also adding to inflationary pressure, making policy more difficult for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).
So far, the central bank has said a first rate rise could come later this year if the economy continues to improve, though markets are pricing in a hike to 0.25% as early as July.
The central bank holds its March policy meeting on Tuesday and is considered certain to keep rates at 0.1%.[AU/INT]
Markets will be keen to see its reaction to the sudden bout of geopolitical uncertainty and to recent data showing wages only picked up modestly in the fourth quarter of last year.

The National Association of Realtors (NAR) said on Friday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on signed contracts, declined 5.7% last month to 109.5. Pending home sales fell in the South, Northeast and Midwest, but rose in the West. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast contracts, which become sales after a month or two, rebounding 1.0%. Pending home sales dropped 9.5% in January on a year-on-year basis.

An acute shortage of previously owned homes is hampering sales. Demand for housing could slow as mortgage rates increase, which together with high prices will further erode affordability, especially for first-time buyers. Mortgage rates are near three-year highs.
""With inventory at an all-time low, buyers are still having a difficult time finding a home,"" said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun. ""Given the situation in the market, mortgages, home costs and inventory, it would not be surprising to see a retreat in housing demand.""

Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, jumped 0.9% last month last month, the Commerce Department said on Friday. These so-called core capital goods orders gained 0.4% in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0.5%. 
Shipments of core capital goods accelerated 1.9% last month after increasing 1.6% in December. 
Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the gross domestic product measurement.
Business spending on equipment rebounded in the fourth quarter after being weighed down by motor vehicle shortages in the July-September quarter. A global shortage of semiconductors is hampering motor vehicle production.
Economists saw limited impact on equipment spending on energy production from the surge in oil prices after Russia invaded Ukraine. Brent crude prices on Thursday rose above $100 per barrel for the first time since 2014 and retreated to about $98.7 a barrel on Friday.
According to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), shale investment had become less sensitive to price increases.

Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, advanced 1.6% last month after rising 1.2% in December. They were boosted by a 3.4% increase orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 1.7% rise in December. 
Motor vehicle orders fell 0.4% after increasing 1.8% in December. Orders for the volatile civilian aircraft category increased 15.6% after rising 23.9% in December. Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website that it had received 77 aircraft orders last month compared to 80 in December.

National statistics institute ISTAT's manufacturing confidence index fell to 113.4 in February from a downwardly revised 113.7 in January, lower than a median forecast of 113.9 in a Reuters survey of 12 analysts.
The January figure was previously given as 113.9. 
However, ISTAT's composite business morale index, combining surveys of the manufacturing, retail, construction and services sectors, rose to 108.2 from a previous 105.3 thanks to improved sentiment among service providers and building companies.
Consumer confidence this month fell to 112.4 from 114.2 in January, below a median forecast of 115.0 in the Reuters' poll and hitting its lowest level since last May.
ISTAT said the decline was caused by a deterioration in opinions on both the general and personal economic situation. 
In the manufacturing sector, the outlook for both orders and production expectations fell, with a decumulation of stocks registered.
The euro zone's third largest economy is forecast by the government to grow 4.7% this year, when gross domestic product is seen returning to pre-pandemic levels, but the Bank of Italy warned last month of growing downside risks to the economic outlook.
The confidence surveys were carried out before the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the announcement of further sanctions on Moscow, which could hurt some Italian exporters.
ISTAT gave the following data on the February manufacturing confidence survey:

310,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 07:00PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The rise in the cost of living in Tokyo matched its fastest pace in the last two years in February, an acceleration from January that suggests nationwide price growth is also due to pick up speed, driven by elevated energy prices.
Excluding fresh food, consumer prices in the capital increased 0.5% from a year earlier, according to the ministry of internal affairs Friday. That outpaced a 0.4% gain expected by economists. 
Even if the faster pace is also reflected at the national level that would still leave price growth far behind the global trend and the Bank of Japan’s 2% target.
Still, the stronger-than-expected price rises suggest Japan’s inflation pulse may be quickening more than expected and could fuel speculation that the BOJ might consider adjusting policy amid a wave of hawkish moves by its global peers in response to stronger price gains.
A sharper jump in the consumer price index is also widely expected in April when slashed phone bill charges from last year start to drop out of the calculations. 
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is also likely to keep oil prices elevated or push them up further.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“Higher costs of imported goods such as food and energy, further fueled by a weaker yen, are likely to buoy consumer prices. For consumers, rising prices of gasoline and food are bad news -- and could hit sentiment and damp spending.”
--Yuki Masujima, economist

Energy costs contributed 1.06 percentage point to overall prices, showing that climbing oil markets have again been the driving force behind Japan’s core inflation numbers.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Friday that the government will ramp up support for those affected by the surge in oil prices after already subsidizing gas stations to cap rising gasoline prices.

Even without the commodity factor, Japan’s inflation is projected to accelerate from April on the phone factor. Nationally, cheaper phone charges have been pushing down the overall inflation index by around 1.5 percentage point in recent months.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda  reiterated Thursday that the current level of inflation doesn’t require the bank to consider making any policy adjustments. The governor underscored that stance with actions last week when the BOJ intervened in the bond market to keep yields low for the first time since 2018. 
Keeping 10-year yields near its zero target is part of the bank’s measures to stimulate the economy and prices.
In a sign of the growing cost pressures on companies, Yaokin Co., producer of a popular 10-yen ($9 cents) snack for children, announced late last month it would raise its price tag to 12 yen for the first increase in 42 years.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Soaring house prices in New Zealand will grind to a halt this year and Australia will follow suit in 2023 as expected higher interest rates rein in two housing markets that are among the least affordable in the world, a Reuters poll predicted.
A multi-year boom in house prices based on near-zero interest rates has gifted homeowners with record piles of equity but is pushing the dream of home ownership further out of reach for first-time buyers, especially those on lower incomes.
While house prices have racked up double-digit gains in both countries over the last year of the pandemic, they rose the most in New Zealand - by nearly 30%. That property market is now the least affordable among OECD nations.
But wages failing to keep pace with living costs, along with the added burden of three interest rate hikes since October from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and more on the way is expected to slam the brakes on the market.
The Feb. 9-24 Reuters poll of property market analysts showed New Zealand average home prices declining about 1.0% this year. They were then expected to climb 1.5% in 2023 and 2.7% in 2024.
""Prices can't go up forever...pandemic-era policy stimulus sent prices into the stratosphere and (now) we are already seeing the housing market slow down in New Zealand pretty quickly,"" said Jeremy Couchman, senior economist at Kiwibank.
""But affordability is still a major concern...prices are expected to fall a little; still, it's a big stretch to pull together a deposit for first homebuyers. It is going to be difficult for them, unfortunately.""
New Zealand's average home price surpassed NZ$1 million for the first time. When asked to describe the level of New Zealand house prices on a scale of 1 to 10, from extremely cheap to extremely expensive, the median response was 9. For Auckland, it was rated 10. 
""We're not talking about large falls in house prices for 2022, so I don't expect it to become a buyer's market,"" said Mike Jones, senior economist at ASB Bank.
""But the balance of power is expected to shift away from sellers more towards buyers, as extra supply comes on stream, and rising interest rates put a big dent in housing demand."" 
In Australia, where prices have nearly doubled since the global financial crisis of 2007-09, they were expected to rise another 6.7% this year, due to record low interest rates.
But that blistering pace of house price appreciation was forecast to come to an end next year and fall 5%.

""The 20%-plus gains in house prices over the past year won't be repeated in 2022...in 2023, we see prices falling modestly as higher mortgage rates start to bite,"" wrote Adelaide Timbrell, senior economist at ANZ.
Australia's central bank will raise interest rates for the first time in a decade in the third quarter, slightly earlier than thought one month ago, a separate Reuters poll forecast. [AU/INT]

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell slightly more than expected last week, indicating that the labor market recovery was gaining traction.
The weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday also showed unemployment rolls shrinking to levels last seen in 1970, underscoring the tightening labor market conditions. There is an acute shortage of workers, with a near record number of job openings, keeping layoffs minimal.
""Beyond weekly moves, we see the downtrend in filings persisting as virus-related disruptions continue to dissipate and businesses return to more normal operations,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""Overall, strong demand for labor amid labor shortages suggest layoffs will remain low.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 17,000 to a seasonally adjusted 232,000 for the week ended Feb. 19. That almost reversed the prior week's surge, which economists had blamed on week-to-week volatility in the data and the delayed impact of winter storms early in the month.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 235,000 applications for the latest week.
Unadjusted claims tumbled 24,824 to 214,873 last week, led by a sharp decline in Missouri. There were also significant decreases in New York, Ohio, Tennessee, Florida and New Jersey, offsetting a large increase in Michigan. 
With 10.9 million job openings at the end of December, claims are likely to fall back below 200,000 in the coming weeks. They were last below this level in early December.
Many Federal Reserve officials view labor market conditions as already at or very close to maximum employment. The U.S. central bank is expected to start raising interest rates in March to tamp down inflation, with economists anticipating as many as seven hikes this year. 
The upbeat labor market news was eclipsed by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which analysts warned could hurt the U.S. economy as surging oil prices boost inflation, hampering consumer spending. Brent crude prices rose above $100 per barrel for the first time since 2014, which will drive gasoline prices higher. Consumer prices notched their largest year-on-year gain in 40 years in January.
""An extended war in Eastern Europe could lead to higher global energy prices and higher U.S. inflation, forcing the Fed to tighten monetary policy aggressively, and higher interest rates could become a larger headwind for the U.S. economy,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in New York.
Stocks on Wall Street tumbled. The dollar rallied against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury yields fell as investors sought a safe haven.
SHRINKING JOBLESS ROLLS
Unemployment claims have plunged from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 112,000 to 1.476 million during the week ended Feb. 12. That was the lowest level for these so-called continuing claims since March 14, 1970.
The continuing claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed households for February's unemployment rate. Continuing claims declined between the January and February survey weeks, implying an improvement in the unemployment rate, which was at 4.0% last month.
Fewer people on unemployment rolls also suggest that some out-of-work Americans are returning to the labor force, which could help ease the worker shortage. 
Tightening labor market conditions are boosting wage growth and contributing to high inflation. Rising wages and better job security should, however, help underpin consumer spending and sustain the economic expansion despite the headwinds from tighter monetary policy and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday confirmed that economic growth accelerated in the fourth quarter as the drag from a resurgence in COVID-19 infections over the summer, driven by the Delta variant, eased. 
Gross domestic product increased at a 7.0% annualized rate last quarter, the government said in its second GDP estimate. That was slightly up from the previously reported 6.9% pace. The economy grew at a 2.3% pace in the third quarter. In 2021, the economy grew 5.7%, the best performance since 1984. 
The upward revision to fourth-quarter GDP growth reflected more business spending on equipment and investment in homebuilding than initially thought. 
The economic momentum briefly faltered amid an onslaught of coronavirus infections fueled by the Omicron variant. Activity has since picked up as cases subsided.
Retail sales surged in January and business activity rebounded in February, data showed this month. That has created an upside risk to GDP growth estimates for the first-quarter, which are mostly below a 2.0% rate.
The United States is reporting an average of 80,131 new COVID-19 infections a day, sharply down from the more than 700,000 in mid-January, according to a Reuters analysis of official data.
Though a third report showed new home sales dropped 4.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 801,000 units in January, the housing market remains underpinned by strong demand amid a severe shortage of houses.

""We continue to expect robust GDP growth of 3.5% this year and believe the expansion can withstand Fed tightening,"" said 
Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

314,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 10:32AM ET</span>",,,,,"WASHINGTON(Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell slightly more than expected in January, likely as rising mortgage rates and higher prices sidelined some first-time buyers from the market.
New home sales fell 4.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 801,000 units last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. December's sales pace was revised higher to 839,000 units from the previously reported 811,000 units.
Sales dropped in the Midwest, Northeast and the densely populated South. But they rose in the West. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for more than 10% of U.S. home sales, falling to a rate of 806,000 units.
Sales tumbled 19.3% on a year-on-year basis in January. 
They peaked at a rate of 993,000 units in January 2021, which was the highest since the end of 2006. Mortgage rates are near three-year highs.
The new housing market remains underpinned by a record-low inventory of previously owned homes. Demand for housing is expected to remain strong even as mortgage rates increase, which together with high prices will further erode affordability, especially for first-time buyers.
The median new house price in January increased 13.4% from a year ago to $423,300. There were 406,000 new homes on the market, up from 394,000 units in December.
Houses under construction made up 65% of the inventory, with homes yet to be built accounting for about 26%. 

The backlog of homes approved for construction but yet to be started is at an all-time high as builders struggle with shortages and higher prices for inputs like softwood lumber for framing, as well as cabinets, garage doors, countertops and appliances.
At January's sales pace it would take 6.1 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 5.6 months in December.

The closely watched core price index, which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, climbed 0.43% in early February, the national statistics agency INEGI said. That was above expectations in a Reuters poll for a 0.31% increase.
Annual core inflation accelerated to 6.52%, beating expectations for a 6.40% rise. The last time the annual core price index reached that level was in the first half of July 2001.
Headline consumer price inflation rose 0.42% during the first half of February, above expectations for a 0.38% increase, while annual headline inflation jumped to 7.22%, versus a forecast for 7.17%.
The jump in inflation suggests Mexico's ""central bank is struggling in its battle to contain price pressures,"" said Nikhil Sanghani, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.
Earlier this month, Banxico, as the Bank of Mexico is known, raised its benchmark interest rate for the sixth consecutive time, citing inflation. 
Banxico targets inflation of 3% with a one percentage point tolerance range above and below that. 

""The recent surge in global commodity prices as a result of the Russia-Ukraine crisis will keep inflation high in the coming months, meaning Banxico's tightening cycle has much further to run,"" said Sanghani.
Banxico will make its next monetary policy decision on March 24, a week after the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates after years of sitting near zero.

The CBI's monthly retail sales balance halved to +14 in February from +28 in January, a bigger fall than economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll for a small decline to +25.
However sales for the time of year improved sharply in February from January, with the balance rising to +16 from -23.
""The easing of COVID-19 restrictions - including the end of work-from-home guidance - has, unsurprisingly, encouraged shoppers to return to the high streets,"" CBI economist Martin Sartorius said.
January's headline sales figures had been bolstered by comparisons with a year earlier when non-essential retailers were closed due to lockdown restrictions.
""There are other challenges facing retailers, however. Conflict in Ukraine means energy prices and transport costs will rise further, adding more pressure on retailers' operating costs and biting into households' spending power,"" Sartorius said.
Quarterly CBI figures showed that retailers raised selling prices by almost as much as in late 2021, which saw the biggest price rises since 1990.

Prices are expected to rise even faster over the next three months, the CBI said. 
Previously released official data showed that British retail sales grew faster than expected in January as the impact of the Omicron wave of coronavirus cases eased. But analysts have warned of a tough year ahead as inflation rises to a 30-year high, squeezing households' disposable income.

The revision came as the statistics office raised its export growth forecast for this year, with global demand for the island's technology products buoyed by 5G, electric vehicles and high end computing.
Gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to rise 4.42% this year, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics said, up from 4.15% growth forecast in November.
However, that will be a slower pace than the 6.45% logged for 2021, which was the fastest rate in over a decade since it expanded 10.25% in 2010.
The directorate said the economic global impact of COVID-19 was gradually dissipating, with continued strong demand for semiconductors, the main plank of Taiwan's economy.
It foresaw exports this year rising 9.69%, from 6.14% predicted before.
The government is watching the impact of the war in Ukraine.
Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Chern-chyi said he expected the impact of the conflict on Taiwan to be ""controllable"", but that they were keeping an eye on supply chains and in close touch with companies.
Cabinet spokesman Lo Ping-cheng added that Taiwan's economic fundamentals remained good, but the government will ""extend a hand"" if there are any ""irrational"" movements in the currency and stock markets.
Taiwan's benchmark stock index closed down 2.6% on Thursday.
Taiwan's exports are a bellwether of demand for global tech giants such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), as the island is a major producer of semiconductors, a global shortage of which has rattled firms like auto makers and boosted Taiwanese corporate profits.
In the fourth quarter, GDP expanded by a revised 4.86% from a year earlier, slightly down from a preliminary reading of 4.88%, the agency added.
Another risk is the slowdown in the economy of China, Taiwan's top trading partner.

China's economy grew 8.1% in 2021 and 4.0% in the final quarter, faster than expected but still its weakest pace since the second quarter of 2020, off the back of weak consumption and a property downturn.

The prices eased 1.1% last month, according to the data, compares to a revised fall of 0.1% in December. The January monthly drop was also the biggest in eleven month. 
Hong Kong's property market is among the world's most expensive and has stayed largely resilient during the mass protests in 2019 and the pandemic over the past two years, supported by robust demand and lower interest rates. 
Its home prices reached a record high in September before consolidating.
Some property agents lowered their full-year price forecast this month as coronavirus infections surged in the Chinese-ruled city and the government rolled out some of the most stringent social restrictions in the world, affecting many businesses.
Hong Kong Property Services expected prices to fall within 5% in the first quarter, but rise 3-5% for the full year on a rebound after the pandemic stabilizes. 
""In the last four waves of outbreak, prices all recovered afterward,"" Dave Ma, Hong Kong Property Services chief operations officer, said. ""Compared to the first outbreak, sellers are not slashing prices as much now and the transaction volumes are higher because people are looking for bargains.""
He said some sellers offloaded property below market price because their business was seriously affected by the pandemic.
Property developers are delaying their new launches, resulting in a plunge in new home transactions. For the secondary market, realtor Centaline expected deal number in February to drop 18% from January to a 24-month low.
Seen as a boost to the property market, the government announced a relaxed rule to allow first-time buyers to borrow 80% mortgage for homes transacted HK$12 million ($1.54 million) and below, compared to HK$10 million previously, while 90% for HK$10 million and below, compared to HK$8 million previously.

BENGALURU - Strong demand is likely to make Dubai house prices rise more sharply this year than previously thought, although plentiful supply is likely to ensure the city state stays a buyer's market for a few more years, a Reuters survey found.
    The Gulf region's trade and tourism hub and host of World Expo, Dubai has experienced a boom in property deals. The sale values of real estate transactions until November last year were the highest yearly sales figures since 2014, Dubai Land Department data shows.
    A Reuters survey of 12 analysts taken Feb. 9-23 found expectations of continued strength, with Dubai housing prices forecast to rise at a faster pace than predicted three months ago. 
It found average home prices were expected to climb 7.5% this year and 5.5% next, compared to 5.0% each in the November survey.
    ""While improvements in the overall economy, along with the continued arrival of new residents, look set to support modest rises in residential sales prices and rents, a strong supply pipeline will likely limit the extent of market-wide uplifts,"" Chris Hobden at Chestertons MENA said.
    According to most analysts who answered an extra question, the Dubai property market will remain a buyer's market for at least the next couple of years. This is in sharp contrast to most residential markets around the world experiencing runaway price rises, particularly during the pandemic. 
    ""There is still a large (amount) of supply that is likely to be completed across Dubai in the next two to three years. This is likely to favour buyers going forward,"" said Swapnil Pillai at Savills.
    An oversupply of homes saddled the real estate sector for several years and will keep Dubai affordable for a while yet. On an affordability scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is extremely cheap and 10 is extremely expensive, analysts returned a median of 5.
    ""Given that Dubai continues to be a buyer's market, developers will refrain from increasing prices substantially. Therefore, affordability may continue for some years,"" said Anuj Puri, chairman at ANAROCK Property Consultants.
    When asked what will happen to affordability over the next two-to-three years, there was a split between all 12 analysts. While six said it would improve, six expected it to worsen, indicating uncertainty around market direction.
    For now increasing demand, especially from foreign investors, high immigration, and a sharp upturn in the economy will be the most significant upside risks, according to respondents to an extra question.

    However, they also cited downside risks including higher interest rates, a depleting stock of affordable homes, and an economic slowdown because of political instability in the region and around the globe.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian business investment bounced modestly last quarter as demand recovered from pandemic lockdowns and miners benefited from high resource prices, while future spending plans were again marked higher. 
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Thursday showed capital expenditure rose a real 1.1% in the December quarter to A$33.3 billion ($24.03 billion), though that missed market forecasts of a 2.6% increase.
Investment by miners climbed 2.5%, while other sectors lagged with a 0.5% increase. 
Spending plans for the year to end-June 2022 were upgraded to A$144.8 billion, at the higher end of analysts' estimates and a sign business confidence weathered the disruptions well.
The early estimate for 2022/23 came in at A$116.7 billion, which was 11% higher than the first estimate for 2021/22.
The miss on fourth-quarter spending will shave some forecasts for gross domestic product (GDP), data for which is due next week.
Yet growth still looks to have rebounded strongly as an easing in coronavirus lockdowns unleashed a wave of pent-up spending by households, which typically account for around 51% of GDP.
A new data series from the ABS released this week showed nominal household spending surged a huge 22% in the fourth quarter, compared to the badly hit third quarter.
Even accounting for a 1.3% jump in consumer prices, that implies real household spending may have boomed by around 10% and dwarfed any drag from other sectors.
Analysts are generally tipping GDP growth of around 2.5% for the fourth quarter, more than making up for the third quarter's 1.9% decline.
More recently, the spread of the Omicron variant did curb spending in January but consumers seem back on track now that cases have tailed off. 

The latest data from ANZ showed spending on its cards by households and businesses had recovered quickly in February. Just last week, spending on dining and takeaway was up 9% on a year ago, non-food retailing 10%, and travel 38%.

Companies signed up for $8.3 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, compared with $8.1 billion a year earlier. Borrowings rose 2% from December.
""Despite persistent supply chain disruptions in several collateral categories and nagging inflation, the equipment finance industry picks up in January where it left off last year,"" said Ralph Petta, ELFA's chief executive officer, in a statement.
ELFA, which reports economic activity for the nearly $1-trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 78.4%, marginally down from 78.6% in December.

The GfK institute said its consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, fell to -8.1 points heading into March from -6.7 points a month earlier, which had marked the first increase after two consecutive months of decline.
Analysts polled by Reuters had on average expected the index to improve to -6.3.

At the same time, mid-term prospects were much better as the government had decided to lift far-reaching pandemic restrictions, Buerkl said.
""This gives reason to hope that consumers' willingness to spend will return as a result. If this were supported by a moderate increase in prices, the consumer climate could finally recover again in the long term,"" the expert said.

(Reuters) - Small businesses continue to struggle financially and many are facing greater challenges with managing supply chain challenges and hiring enough workers, according to a survey released Tuesday by the Federal Reserve. 
While some small businesses have seen their revenues increase, the recovery has been uneven, with smaller firms and those owned by racial minorities seeing fewer gains, the report showed. 
""Many small businesses have not recovered to prepandemic levels, with the effects of the pandemic hitting disproportionately hard among firms in the leisure and hospitality sector, smaller firms, and firms owned by people of color,"" Fed researchers said in a statement.
The survey, which was conducted between September and November of 2021, found that 63% of firms still had revenues below pre-pandemic levels, and 43% of businesses had lower employment. The Fed polled nearly 11,000 small employers across the country that have less than 500 workers. 
Businesses are having a hard time finding enough workers and resolving supply-chain issues, the survey found, with 60% of firms naming hiring issues and 60% listing supply-chain issues as a top operational challenge faced over the past 12 months.
The report, done in collaboration with the 12 regional Fed banks, found that many small businesses are still in rough financial shape because of the pandemic. 

More than half, or 59%, of firms surveyed said they were in ""fair"" or ""poor"" financial shape, nearly unchanged from 57% a year earlier, according to the report. 
Those outcomes continued to vary by race. Some 55% of white-owned businesses described their financial condition as ""fair"" or ""poor."" But that rose to 81% of Asian-owned businesses, to 76% for Black-owned firms and to 74% for Hispanic-owned businesses, similar to last year.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian wages picked up last quarter as a rapidly tightening labour market drove intense competition for workers, but annual growth was still short of levels that policy makers say would justify a rise in interest rates.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Wednesday showed its wage price index (WPI) rose 0.7% in the December quarter, matching forecasts and the largest increase since late 2013.
The annual rate picked up to 2.3%, but missed forecasts of 2.4% which caused a dip in the local dollar. The private sector saw growth of 2.4%, while the public payroll lagged at 2.1%.
Wage growth was still only back to where it was in mid-2019 and short of the 3%-plus levels the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) argues is needed to keep inflation at target.
It is also below consumer price inflation of 3.5%, meaning real pay is going backwards.
Of the 18 industries the ABS covers on wages the only one to clear 3% last quarter was accommodation and food, reflecting the lack of migrant labour with the borders closed.
National pay claims have not topped 3% since early 2013 and there is a lot of structural inertia in the pay award system, a major reason the RBA believes it can keep policy super-loose until later in the year.
Financial markets are not so sure and have long been pricing in a hike in the 0.1% cash rate by June, with rates reaching 1.25% by year end.
The labour market is clearly tightening with unemployment having fallen sharply to a 13-year low of 4.2% and expected to drop further given vacancies are at record highs.
Cost pressures from supply bottlenecks and high global commodity prices are also percolating through the economy.
Australia's second largest grocery chain  Coles Group  (OTC:CLEGF) Ltd on Tuesday warned inflation had broadened last quarter and would last through the first half of the year.
The RBA itself recently signalled a switch away from focussing just on wages to a range of measures to gauge price pressures, including unit labour costs, job switching, bonuses and industry liaison.

""Anecdotally, wage growth is ""everywhere but in the data"","" noted Catherine Birch, a senior economist at ANZ. ""But given the shift in the balance of power towards employees, and the overseas experience, we think the wage growth will hit 3% by the second quarter and 3.5% by year end.""
""This is consistent with our expectation that the RBA will start hiking the cash rate in Q3.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence fell to a five-month low month in February, with fewer consumers planning to purchase homes, automobiles and go on vacation over the next six months amid concerns about the short-term economic outlook.
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday also showed consumers' inflation expectations rising after moderating for two straight months. But with the labor market rapidly churning out jobs and COVID-19 cases subsiding, the second straight monthly decline in confidence and drop in buying intentions likely do not signal a major slowdown in consumer spending. 
Retail sales surged in January even as confidence ebbed. Consumers accumulated more than $2 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic, which should help to underpin spending.
""Though inflation is high and a major concern for consumers, it hasn't historically restricted spending,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""With the Omicron wave quickly subsiding and many states and cities lifting restrictions, we should expect spending, especially on services, to accelerate.""
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dipped to a reading of 110.5 this month, the lowest since last September, from 111.1 in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index decreasing to 110.0. 
The index remains above its pandemic lows. Unlike the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, which fell to a decade low in mid-February, the Conference Board survey puts more emphasis on the labor market. 
The survey's measure of current conditions improved, likely because of declining coronavirus infections that were driven by the Omicron variant. Its gauge of expectations for growth in the short term fell to a five-month low, suggesting a cooling in growth in the first half of the year. 
But the slowdown will probably be modest, with business activity regaining speed in February as the drag from the Omicron surge diminished.
In a separate, data firm IHS Markit said its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, rebounded to a reading of 56.0 this month from 51.1 in January. It attributed the sharp rise to ""employees returning from sick leave, increased traveling and greater availability of raw materials.""
Stocks on Wall Street fell amid escalating Russia-Ukraine tensions. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose. 
TIGHT LABOR MARKET
The Conference Board's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, fell to a still-high reading of 42.0 this month from 43.0 in January. This measure correlates to the unemployment rate from the Labor Department. There were 10.9 million jobs openings at the end of December. 
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months increased to 7.0% from 6.8% last month. With inflation expectations rising, fewer consumers planned to buy cars and other big-ticket items over the next six months. Consumers were also not keen on vacations, with the share planning to go on holiday over the same period the smallest since June 2021.
Plans to buy a house also fell, likely reflecting rising mortgage rates, which combined with soaring prices are making home purchasing unaffordable, especially for first-time buyers.
Record low housing supply is driving up prices. The backlog of homes approved for construction but yet to be started is at an all-time high as builders struggle with shortages and higher prices for inputs like softwood lumber for framing, as well as cabinets, garage doors, countertops and appliances.
There is a migration from metro areas with expensive homes to areas in the Mountain West and South regions, where houses are relatively more affordable. The migration, fueled by both remote work and strong regional economies, is driving up house prices, analysts and realtors say.
A third report showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller's 20 metropolitan area home price index rose 18.6% on a year-on-year basis in December after advancing 18.3% in November. 
The increase was led by Phoenix, where prices shot up 32.5% over the past year. Prices surged 29.4% in Tampa and accelerated 27.3% in Miami. Both are experiencing rapid growth in technology and financial sectors. There was also strong price appreciation in San Diego, Las Vegas, Denver and Los Angeles. 
""The influx of new investment is pulling in new residents from the Northeast, many of whom have sold homes at prices well above the median in Tampa and Miami, which allows them to bid aggressively for the paucity of homes that are on the market,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Strong house price inflation was reinforced by a fourth report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency showing home prices increased 17.6% in the 12 months through December after a similar gain in November. There were big gains in the Mountain, Pacific, South Atlantic, East South Central, West South Central and New England regions.

Though mortgage rates are near three-year highs, they are expected to remain low by historical standards.
""Consequently, house prices will extend their upward trend in 2022 driven by a combination of limited supply and steadily rising demand,"" said Brent Campbell, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics, in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

It attributed the sharp rise to ""employees returning from sick leave, increased traveling and greater availability of raw materials.""

The survey's measure of input prices paid by businesses rebounded from January's ten-month low. 
The pick up in activity this month was across the board. The IHS Markit survey's flash services sector PMI rose to a reading of 56.7 from 51.2 in January. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 53.0 this month for the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
Services industry businesses reported increases in orders and employment. They continued to face higher prices for inputs. 

Activity also regained momentum in the manufacturing sector, with strong order growth and rising employment. The survey's flash manufacturing PMI climbed to 57.5 from 55.5 in January. Economists had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, rising to 56.0.

The survey also showed a net balance of +20% of factories reporting rising orders, down from +24% in January. While this was the weakest reading for four months, it was still well above the survey's long-run average.

LONDON (Reuters) -The euro zone economic recovery regained momentum this month as an easing of coronavirus restrictions gave a boost to the bloc's dominant service industry, a survey showed, but consumers faced prices rising at a record rate.
As the Omicron coronavirus variant swept across Europe some governments reimposed measures to contain its spread, but with large swathes of the population now vaccinated many of those measures have been eased. 
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as guide to overall economic health, jumped to a five-month high of 55.8 in February from 52.3 in January, significantly above the median 52.7 forecast in a Reuters poll.
""The surge in the euro zone flash Composite PMI for February suggests activity is recovering well from the pandemic-related weakness over the winter,"" said Andrew Kenningham at Capital Economics.
""Having regained its pre-pandemic level in Q4 2021, the euro zone economy is likely to expand at a reasonable pace in the first quarter of this year and should accelerate in the next two quarters as tourism, travel and hospitality get back to normal.""
A flash PMI for the service industry soared to 55.8 from 51.1, a five-month high and above all forecasts in a Reuters poll that had predicted only a modest rise to 52.0. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
Improving demand for services pushed business activity across Germany's private sector to a six-month high, while in France growth was stronger than expected, helped by an improvement in the COVID-19 situation.
In Britain, outside the common currency bloc and the European Union, the private sector picked up at the fastest pace since June 2021, as spending on travel, leisure and entertainment rose after an easing of coronavirus cases.
Factories had another solid month and the flash euro zone manufacturing PMI only dipped from January's 58.7 - where the Reuters poll predicted it would hold - coming in at 58.4. An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI nudged up to 55.6 from 55.4.
Activity could have been faster but lingering supply chain bottlenecks and booming demand meant factories were unable to keep up, and the backlogs of work index rose to 58.7 from 56.9.
With the economy reopening, and amid hopes the worst of the pandemic is over, optimism improved across the board. The services business expectations index climbed to 68.7 from 67.2.
""The forward-looking indicators were also encouraging as year-ahead sentiment rose in February to its strongest since June 2021,"" said Ricardo Amaro at Oxford Economics.
""The weak start to the year means euro zone GDP growth is likely to remain modest in Q1, but today's PMI results chime with our forecast that solid growth will resume in Q2.""
The economic rebound came despite overall prices charged by firms rising at the fastest rate since IHS Markit began collecting the data in late 2002. The composite output prices index climbed to 62.7 from 61.9.
Inflation in the euro zone hit a record high in January and the European Central Bank is under growing pressure to tighten monetary policy. A Reuters poll last week suggested the Bank would raise its deposit rate in the second half of this year, and not wait until 2023 as previously expected. [ECILT/EU]

""The PMI suggests the winter economic dip could be much milder than expected, labour market pressures continue to build and second-round effects are resulting in more broad-based price pressures at the moment,"" said Bert Colijn at ING. 
""Expect this to add to hawkish pressures ahead of the European Central Bank March meeting.""

339,"<span>Feb 21, 2022 07:35AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BERLIN (Reuters) -German producer prices rose in January at their fastest rate since modern records began, soaring 25% and extending a run of sharp increases likely to keep businesses under financial stress and consumer inflation high.
Monday's Federal Statistics Office showed most of the rise was due to spiralling energy costs, which the BDI industry association said were threatening to hamper an economy that the country's central bank said was probably shrinking due to increased coronavirus-induced worker absences. 
The jump in factory gate costs, considered a leading indicator for consumer prices, was the biggest since 1949, when West and East Germany were founded and the country's post-war economic data series began.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a repeat of December's figure of 24.2%. Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) increases of 18.4% and 19.2% were logged in October and November, respectively.
That succession of jumps in the PPI measure, taken before products are processed further or go on sale, suggests ""the pressure in the inflation pipeline remains high,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Ralph Solveen. 
""We expect the (consumer) inflation rate in Germany to hover around 5% percent into the autumn,"" he added, one percentage point more than the Ifo economic institute's average forecast for 2022. 
LBBW analyst Jens-Oliver Niklasch agreed that ""it's likely that retailers will pass on at least some of this (PPI pressure) on to end consumers"".
Separately, the Bundesbank warned of parallel pressures on economic activity from COVID-19, saying a new wave of infections that were stopping many from going to work would probably cause gross domestic product to shrink for the second quarter in a row between January and March.
""Unlike in previous waves ...it is not just activity in the services sector that is likely affected by containment measures and behavioural changes,"" Germany's central bank wrote in a monthly report, while forecasting a rebound in the spring.
""Instead, pandemic-related absence from work is likely to dampen economic activity markedly also in other sectors.""
ECB DILEMMA
The economic pattern in the euro zone's biggest economy is being replicated elsewhere in the single currency bloc, complicating the European Central Bank's task of engineering a smooth transition back towards its consumer inflation target of 2% at a time of high but volatile price pressures and headwinds to growth.
The ECB this month opened the door for the first time to an interest rate hike in 2022 and is set to decide in March how quickly to wind down the bond-buying scheme at the heart of its monetary stimulus programme.
It has argued that longer-term inflation trends remain skewed upward by transitory factors, especially energy costs, which the statistics office said rose 66.7% year-on-year in Germany in January.
The BDI said on Monday that those costs, which show no sign of abating, were threatening to cripple the economy and called for government action to ensure German companies remained globally competitive.

In a survey of more than 400 companies, nearly two-thirds said rising energy costs were posing a strong challenge, while nearly a quarter said they threatened their existence, it said.
Stripping out energy costs, German producer prices rose 12% in January.

U.K. services companies rebounded more quickly than anticipated in February as coronavirus restrictions were lifted, according to a report that will pile pressure on the Bank of England to ramp up interest rates next month.
The travel, leisure and entertainment industries roared back to life after spending was hit by the omicron outbreak in January, the survey of purchasing managers by IHS Markit showed. An index of services-sector activity soared by 6.7 percentage points to 60.8, the highest for eight months and well above the 55.5 median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.
The resurgence was accompanied by intensifying inflation pressures, with costs rising at the second-fastest pace on record and services firms hiking prices in response. Traders are fully pricing in a 25 basis-point interest-rate increase when the BOE next meets in March, with the strong possibility of a 50 basis-point move, a scale unprecedented since the BOE gained independence in 1997.
“The odds of an increasingly aggressive policy tightening have shortened, with a third back-to-back rate rise looking increasingly inevitable in March,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
With headline inflation at a 30-year high and forecast to top 7% in April, more than triple the BOE target, policy makers are expected to deliver a series of rate rises that will see benchmark borrowing costs hit almost 2% by the end of the year. Markets are pricing in a half-point increase at one of the next two meetings.
The performance of the services industry is crucial because it makes up around 80% of the U.K. economy. The manufacturing sector had a less spectacular month, with an index of activity remaining at 57.3. That still implies a healthy rate of expansion, and the reading was slightly stronger than economists forecast.
Williamson said questions remain about whether the economy can sustain the revival, with the cost of living crisis escalating and the risk of conflict between Russia and Ukraine hanging over the economy and markets. “Downside risks to the demand outlook have risen,” he said.

Central bank data showed the current account gap reached 1.707 billion euros ($1.94 billion) from a deficit of 0.639 billion euros in December 2020.
The Bank of Greece said the widening of the current account deficit was the result of a larger trade gap as imports outpaced exports. At constant prices exports were down 1.5% while imports rose 17.1%.
In 2021 as a whole, Greece's current account deficit shrank by 356 million euros compared to a year earlier reaching 10.6 billion euros ($12.04 billion).
Tourism revenue in December rose to 177 million euros from 35 million in the same month a year earlier, when widespread curbs to stem the spread of COVID-19 were in force.

Taiwan's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, rose 11.7% from a year earlier to $58.87 billion last month, data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs showed on Monday, though that was the slowest growth rate in 15 months.
It marked the 23rd straight month of expansion, with the pace largely tracking the median forecast for a rise of 12.0% in a Reuters poll.
Orders for telecommunications products rose 3.9% on year and up 13.5% for electronic products in January, normally the start of the low season with Christmas out of the way, with the ministry reporting good demand and easing supply chain problems.
Growth has been supported by the work-from-home-trend during the pandemic as well as a global semiconductor shortage.
However, while the ministry said demand would continue to be supported by tech, especially ""ardent"" demand for chips, it warned supply chain issues were still present along with COVID-19 worries.
Taiwanese companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) are major suppliers to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and other global tech firms.
In December, export orders rose 12.1% from a year earlier to $67.9 billion, far better than economist forecasts.
The ministry said it expects an increase in export orders in February to be in a range of between 5.6% and 9.2% from a year earlier. The first week of the month was marked by the Lunar New Year holiday in Taiwan and its largest trading partner China.

Orders from the United States rose 18.6% in January from a year earlier, a faster rate of expansion compared with the 16.9% logged in December, while orders from China increased 8.9%, versus a gain of 4.5% the previous month.
Orders from Europe fell 1.2%, while those from Japan edged up 0.7%.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for France's dominant services industry rose to 57.9 points from 53.1 in January, beating a forecast which had predicted 53.6 points for that flash February number.
The index moved further above the 50 points threshold which marks an expansion in activity.
The February flash PMI number for France's manufacturing sector rose to 57.6 points from 55.5 in January, and also beat a forecast of 55.5 points.
The composite February PMI number for France - which includes both the manufacturing and services sectors - rose to 57.4 points from 52.7 in January, beating a forecast for 53.1 points.
French economic activity has been helped by an improvement in the country's COVID-19 situation, which in turn has led to COVID restrictions gradually being eased.
Earlier this month, France eased some restrictions on travellers coming into the country who hold a COVID vaccine certificate, which could help tourism in France.

""The slump in January proved to be short-lived as business activity growth accelerated sharply in February to its strongest since last June,"" said IHS Markit senior economist Joe Hayes.

IHS Markit's flash services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 56.6 in February, up from 52.2 last month and the highest reading since August.
As a result, the composite PMI, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the German economy, also rose to a six-month high of 56.2, from 53.8 in January.
On the other hand, the flash manufacturing PMI dropped to 58.5 from 59.8, below analyst forecasts for a reading of 59.5, as staff absences due to COVID-19 infections offset strong order growth and easing supply chain bottlenecks.
The results showcased the resilience of the German economy, whose recovery from the pandemic was held back last year by supply shortages and fears that the Omicron variant could result in crippling lockdowns.
""The German economy continued to regain momentum in February following December's brief stagnation in output growth,"" said Phil Smith, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit, adding there were also positive signs from the manufacturing sector.

""Although goods production rose at a softer pace, data on new orders showed the fastest rise in six months. Moreover, supply chain pressures appeared to ease further as average lead times lengthened to the least extent since Nov. 2020,"" he said.

BANGKOK (Reuters) -Thailand's economy returned to growth in the fourth quarter, expanding faster than expected, but the 2021 pace was one of the slowest in Southeast Asia and the recovery this year is likely to be modest as tourism remains well below pre-pandemic levels.
The government maintained its gross domestic product (GDP) growth outlook at 3.5%-4.5%, counting on a limited impact from the Omicron-driven coronavirus outbreak, stronger domestic demand and tourism and continued support from exports and public investment. 
Southeast Asia's second-largest economy expanded a seasonally adjusted 1.8% in the December quarter from the previous three months, data from the National Economic and Social Development Council showed on Monday, outstripping a forecast 1.4% increase in a Reuters poll, and after a revised seasonally adjusted 0.9% contraction in the third quarter.
The state planning agency expected 5.5 million tourists in 2022, up from a forecast of 5 million in November, after the government resumed a quarantine waiver for overseas visitors this month to help revive the vital sector, which normally accounts for about 12% of Thai GDP.. 
However, those numbers are still well below 40 million foreign tourist arrivals in 2019.
Analysts at Capital Economics expect the overall economic recovery over 2022 is likely to be weak, and would largely depend on how quickly tourists return.
""While we expect a sustained recovery in the tourism sector to get underway this year, arrivals will still be far fewer than pre-pandemic, meaning the overall economic recovery will remain weak,"" they wrote in a note to clients.
FISCAL, TOURISM SUPPORT
From a year earlier, GDP grew 1.9% in October-December, beating a forecast 0.7% rise, and against a revised 0.2% contraction in the previous three months.
For 2021, however, Thailand's GDP growth of 1.6% was one of the slowest in Southeast Asia, after a revised 6.2% contraction in 2020.
Fourth-quarter growth was helped by robust exports and a recovery in domestic activity following an easing of coronavirus curbs and as borders reopened to foreign visitors.
The economy is likely to perform well in the first quarter of this year, but there is some inflationary pressure, NESDC chief Danucha Pichayanan told a news conference.
""The main driver will be exports and fiscal disbursement, with tourism and domestic consumption adding to the support,"" he said.
The agency maintained its forecast export growth at 4.9% this year.

The government has introduced billions of dollars of relief measures to revive the economy while the central bank has left its key rate unchanged at a record low of 0.50% since May 2020. 
Given the weaker growth trajectory, ""we think the central bank will want to keep monetary policy supportive,"" analysts at Capital Economists said.

Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities climbed 0.1% from a month earlier in January, compared with a 0.2% drop in December, according to Reuters calculations from data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
China's property market, accounting for a quarter of gross domestic product by some metrics, has slowed due to Beijing's push to cut leverage in the sector amid defaults at heavily-indebted players such as China Evergrande Group.
To ease the pain for developers, authorities have taken a slew of measures since late 2021, including giving real estate firms easier access to funds from escrowed accounts.
""The marginal improvement in the financial and credit environment since the fourth quarter of last year helped the value of transactions to bottom out,"" said Xu Xiaole, analyst at Beike Research Institute. 
Credit conditions are expected to continue to ease, which would help lift transactions and stabilise home prices, Xu said.
Household loans, mostly mortgages, surged to 843 billion yuan ($133 billion) in January, more than doubling from 371.6 billion yuan in December, according to central bank data earlier this month.
Overall new bank lending more than tripled in January from the previous month. Chinese lenders tend to front-load loans at the start of the year to get higher-quality customers and win market share.
BIG CITY GAINS
The number of cities reporting price gains rose to 28 from 15 in December, driven mainly by the larger tier-one and tier-two cities.
Average prices of new housing in the country's four largest cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen - swung from a month-on-month decrease of 0.1% in December to an increase of 0.6% in January, the NBS said in a separate statement.
The biggest swing was seen in Guangzhou, where prices rose 0.5% from a 0.6% decline.
Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen increased 1.0%, 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively.
""The rise in tier-one cities has less to do with seasonal factors and more due to purchasing power amid (easing) credit policies in place,"" said Yan Yuejin, research director of Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development Institution.
Last month, developers in Shenzhen and Beijing took some measures to boost sales, offering buyers a 1% discount for cash payments.
""Prices in tier-one cities will definitely continue to rise,"" Yan said.
Though easing measures are helping, new home prices rose at the slowest pace of 2.3% since December 2015 from a year earlier, narrowing from the 2.6% growth recorded in December. 
The central government, while keeping curbs on speculative purchases and blind borrowing, is expected to roll out more measures to support buyer sentiment, which has sharply weakened due to the liquidity crisis faced by developers.
A handful of cities not constrained by regulatory restrictions on purchases are starting to relax downpayment rules for home purchases in a bid to stoke buyer interest.
""The market is expected to gradually stabilise in March or April,"" said Zhang Dawei, chief analyst with property agency Centaline. 

""First- and second-tier cities will be the first to come out of the downturn.""

“Homebuyers are still in a heavy wait-and-see mode after price cuts in December extended to the New Year,” said Chen Wenjing, associate research director at China Index Holdings. “Many cities will likely remain lackluster this month.”
Chinese authorities have been racing to arrest the property slowdown, which has been hurting growth in the world’s second-largest economy. Banks in several Chinese cities have cut mortgage down payments for some homebuyers, according to local media, in a move that may boost flagging housing demand.
Still, the outlook remains bleak.

WASHINGTON(Reuters) - U.S. home sales unexpectedly increased in January, but investors paying in cash are squeezing out first-time buyers from the housing market amid record low inventory and higher prices.
The surge in sales of previously owned homes last month reported by the National Association of Realtors on Friday also reflected buyers rushing in to close contracts in anticipation of mortgage rates rising further. Investors made up the largest share of transactions in six years last month. 
Mortgage rates have climbed to levels not seen since 2019 as the Federal Reserve is expected to start increasing interest rates next month to tame soaring inflation. Economists are anticipating as many as seven rate hikes this year.
""This is the rush to get in before borrowing costs move higher,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""Unfortunately, first-timers are being priced out of the increasingly expensive purchase.""
Existing home sales jumped 6.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.50 million units last month. Sales rose in all four regions, with strong gains in the Midwest, the most affordable region. Sales soared 9.3% in the densely populated South, which is experiencing an influx of residents from other regions as companies embrace remote work.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales decreasing 1.0% to a rate of 6.10 million units. 
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, fell 2.3% on a year-on-year basis. 
Strong demand for housing against the backdrop of a strengthening labor market and massive savings is outstripping supply, curbing sales. Builders have been unable to significantly ramp up construction because of shortages and higher prices for inputs like softwood lumber for framing as well as cabinets, garage doors, countertops and appliances.
According to a report this week from the National Association of homebuilders, delivery of these products was taking ""months,"" raising construction costs and delaying projects. The Commerce Department reported on Thursday that the backlog of homes approved for construction but yet to be started raced to a record in January.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower amid building tensions in Ukraine. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
HOUSING SHORTAGE
Tight supply is keeping house prices elevated. The median existing house price increased 15.4% from a year earlier to $350,300 in January. Sales remained concentrated in the higher price brackets, where houses are less scarce. 
Sales of homes $250,000 and below, the much sought after price category, continued to decline. 
First-time buyers accounted for 27% of sales last month, compared to 33% a year ago. Rising mortgage rates could make home buying even less affordable for this group.
Individual investors or second-home buyers, who make up many cash sales, bought 22% of homes. That was the largest share since October 2015 and was up from 15% a year ago. Investors are renovating, and either reselling or renting the homes to take advantage of the hot housing market. All-cash sales made up 27% of transactions compared to 19% last January.
There were a record-low 860,000 previously owned homes on the market last month, down 16.5% from a year ago. At January's sales pace, it would take an all-time low 1.6 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 1.9 months a year ago.
A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. In January, houses typically remained on the market for 19 days, down from 21 days a year ago.
Seventy-nine percent of homes sold last month were on the market for less than a month. 

The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.92% in the week ending Feb 17, the highest since May 2019, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). That was up from 3.69% in the prior week. Economists expect rising mortgage rates will contribute to slowing sales this year. 
""Resilient demand and strong income gains will underpin the housing market, but limited supply and declining affordability from both higher prices and sharply higher mortgage rates will constrain the pace of sales,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian retail sales most likely rose 2.4% in January from December, preliminary data from Statistics Canada showed on Friday, following on a 1.8% decline in December as consumers stayed home amid concerns over the Omicron coronavirus variant.
Retail sales totaled C$57.05 billion ($44.91 billion) in December, down from C$58.06 billion in November. For full year 2021, retail sales came in at C$674 billion, an all-time record, Statscan said. 
In December, sales were down in eight of 11 subsectors, representing 41.7% of retail trade. The clothing and accessories, and furniture and home furnishings subsectors, led the declines.
""However, there was good news from the advance data for January which points to a rebound,"" Andrew Grantham, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said in a note.
""That will provide an offset to other areas of the services sector within monthly GDP, which will have seen sharp declines during the month due to enhanced restrictions."" 
Statscan said about 15% of retailers reported continued impacts in December from floods in British Columbia, which shut roads and rail access to Canada's largest port in Vancouver. In volume terms, retail sales were down 2.5% in December.

LONDON (Reuters) - British shoppers began to return to stores last month after many stayed away during a wave of COVID-19 cases that peaked at the turn of the year, although fast-rising inflation is curbing their spending power.
Retail sales volumes rose by 1.9% in January after a 4.0% decline in December, the Office for National Statistics said, the largest rise since lockdown rules for non-essential stores in England were relaxed in April 2021.
The monthly increase was greater than the average 1.0% gain forecast in a Reuters poll, although December's drop in sales was slightly bigger than first estimated.
Britain's wider economy shrank by 0.2% in December, according to an initial estimate last week.
""The solid rise in retail sales volumes in January adds to the signs that the Omicron-induced hit to activity was smaller and shorter-lived than previously thought. Even so, the cost of living crisis means the outlook for retailers is anything but bright,"" said Adam Hoyes, economist at Capital Economics.
Households face rapidly surging consumer price inflation, which hit its highest in nearly 30 years in January at 5.5%, and is forecast by the Bank of England to peak above 7% in April.
A separate measure of inflation used to calculate January's retail sales data rose to 6.7%, the highest since this data began in 1997.
Fast-rising prices for energy and food leave consumers with less spare cash to spend on non-essentials, and 2022 looks set to bring the biggest squeeze on households disposable income in 30 years.

January's sales volumes were 9.1% higher than a year earlier, when non-essential shops were shut due to lockdown restrictions, and 3.6% above pre-pandemic levels.
Britain's retail sector as a whole was relatively resilient through the COVID-19 pandemic, with sales exceeding January 2020 levels in July 2020, thanks to a big shift to online shopping.
However some retailers, especially clothes stores with little online presence, found it much harder to recover from repeated lockdowns. 
Clothing and footwear sales fell 5.0% in January - which the ONS said might be down to smaller-than-usual discounts in the seasonal sales - and are 13% below pre-pandemic levels.
Some pandemic trends have been slowly reversing. The percentage of sales made online fell to 25.3% in January, its lowest since March 2020 although still well above the 19.8% seen in February 2020 before the pandemic.

Food sales dropped below pre-pandemic levels for the first time.

PARIS (Reuters) -France's unemployment rate fell in the final quarter of last year to the lowest level since 2008, data showed on Friday, boosting Emmanuel Macron's economic credentials less than two months before a presidential election.
The unemployment rate fell to 7.4% from 8.0% in the previous three months, the INSEE statistics agency said. A Reuters poll of eight economists had on average forecast 7.8%.
It was the lowest level of unemployment since the third quarter of 2008, with the exception of an anomalous unrepresentative drop at the start of the pandemic because jobseekers could not look for work during a nationwide lockdown.
Stubbornly high unemployment has long been the bane of previous French presidents, and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire called the drop in the fourth quarter a ""great victory against resignation and fatalism"".
""With Emmanuel Macron we tried something different, we reformed the labour market, we supported apprenticeships, we cut taxes and overhauled the tax system, now the results are there,"" Le Maire said on RTL radio.
The drop put the rate within reach of a campaign promise Macron made in 2017 to cut unemployment to 7% by the end of his term.
Widely expected to seek second five-year term in an election in April, Macron is heading into the vote with one of the strongest economic track records in generations for an incumbent president.
With growth last year of 7%, the European Union's second-biggest economy expanded the fastest in more than five decades in 2021, boosting the labour market as firms struggled to keep up with a recovery in client demand.

Beyond the headline decrease in joblessness, INSEE's quarterly employment report also had good news for youth employment, which was the lowest since 1981 at 15.9% and down sharply from 24.7% when Macron took office in 2017.
However, the employment rate, the share of the workforce in work, dipped slightly to 73.3% although it still remained close to its highest level in decades as well.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia booked a current account surplus for the first time in a decade in 2021, data showed on Friday, but its balance of payments came under pressure in the final quarter due to bond market outflows and higher imports.
Bank Indonesia (BI) data showed Southeast Asia's largest economy recorded a $3.3 billion current account surplus last year, equivalent to 0.3% of gross domestic product, helped by a commodity price boom and strong demand from trade partners. It was Indonesia's first surplus since 2011.
The 2021 balance of payments registered a $13.5 billion surplus.
Persistent current account deficits and reliance on foreign portfolio inflows have previously contributed to the volatility of the rupiah, but analysts say last year's surplus should help steady the currency this year even as global liquidity tightens.
Signs of an acceleration in the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary tightening have already spurred outflows from the Indonesian bond market, squeezing capital and financial accounts in the fourth quarter, data showed.
The current account surplus narrowed to $1.42 billion, or 0.4% of GDP, in the fourth quarter, from a $4.97 billion surplus, or 1.7% of GDP, in the previous three months, on rising imports and freight costs.
The fourth quarter also saw a deficit of $844 million in the balance of payments, compared with the July to September period's $10.69 billion surplus.
JP Morgan analyst Sin Ben Ong said fourth-quarter bond outflows of $4.9 billion were the second largest in more than a decade, but he noted that net foreign exchange reserves ""exhibited remarkable resilience"".
He said this would reduce BI's need to move its policy rate in lockstep with the Fed. 

BI's latest outlook is for the current account to swing back to a deficit of between 1.1% to 1.9% of GDP in 2022, on moderating commodity prices and rising domestic demand as economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic strengthens.
Bank Mandiri's analyst Faisal Rachman predicted a 2.15% current account deficit and limited portfolio inflows this year, and that the balance of payments will likely post a smaller surplus than in 2021.

The median forecast from a poll of 13 economists expects export orders to rise 12.0% from the year-ago period. Forecasts for growth ranged from 4.1% to as high as 24.4%.
The island's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, rose 12.1% from a year earlier to $67.9 billion in December, the highest monthly figure on record.
Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for hi-tech gadgets and Asian exports, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.

The island's manufacturers, including the world's largest contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, are a key part of the global supply chain for technology giants including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
The data for January will be released on Monday.

362,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 07:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s key inflation measure weakened last month in another sign that Japan’s price dynamics are at odds with a global trend of rapid acceleration that is prompting central bank action overseas.
Growth in consumer prices excluding fresh food slowed to 0.2% in January from a year earlier, compared with 0.5% in the previous month, according to the ministry of internal affairs Friday. 
Economists had expected a gain of 0.3% as an earlier boost from higher hotel charges largely dropped out of the calculations.    
The dent in price gains underscores Japan’s status as an outlier amid global inflationary pressures and could cool recent speculation that the Bank of Japan might consider adjusting policy even before Governor Haruhiko Kuroda finishes his term next year.
The BOJ chief has repeatedly reiterated his view that there is no need to discuss normalizing policy with prices still so distant from a 2% target. 
The central bank underlined its commitment to stick with its stimulus framework earlier this week when it offered to buy government bonds at a fixed rate to keep yields below a ceiling.
Still, the speculation of possible changes is likely to rumble on as other central banks make hawkish pivots in their policy direction. 
Prices in Japan are also expected to jump in April when the impact of slashed phone fees fades out of index, another factor that will likely keep market players chattering.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“We expect core inflation to pick up slightly in February. Elevated energy prices and a weaker yen are likely to support the core inflation gauge.”

The release showed that energy costs contributed 1.2 percentage point to overall prices, an indication of how important climbing oil markets have been in driving up Japan’s inflation readings. Oil prices hit their highest since 2014 this week. 
Gains in hotel fees, a key price booster in recent months, eased to less than 1% in January, sapping overall momentum. Accommodation costs had been surging due to year-earlier comparisons with a period when government-initiated discounts for the travel industry were still in effect.
Last year’s sharp cuts to mobile phone fees continued to push down the overall index by around 1.5 percentage point.
Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute, is among an increasing number of economists seeing a good chance of the price data hitting the BOJ’s price target this spring and hovering around that level to fuel market expectations of an unwinding of stimulus.
Kuroda has said the central bank is looking for sustainable inflation backed by wage growth, a combination needed to overcome an entrenched deflationary mindset. 
The dislike of price increases among companies and consumers was illustrated this week by a big supermarket chain dropping the products of a diaper maker because it had pushed up its prices.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose last week, but remained below pre-pandemic levels as labor market conditions continue to tighten.
The first increase in a month reported by the Labor Department on Thursday did not change economists' expectations for another month of solid employment gains in February. 
There is an acute shortage of workers, which has seen employers boosting wages and offering other incentives to retain their workforce as well as attract labor. Economists blamed the rise in claims on week-to-week volatility in the data and harsh weather in some parts of the country.
""Given the regular noise in the data and the range of factors that can impact filings we don't think the recent jump in initial claims filings is particularly worrisome at this point,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""Overall, we think that the labor market remains tight.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 23,000 to a seasonally adjusted 248,000 for the week ended Feb. 12. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 219,000 applications for the latest week.
Unadjusted claims climbed 7,742 to 238,482 last week, lifted by big increases in Missouri, Ohio and Kentucky, which offset notable declines in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Wisconsin.
Claims had been declining since hitting a three-month high in mid-January as coronavirus cases, fueled by the Omicron variant, raged across the country. Infections have dropped significantly in recent weeks. 
There were a near record 10.9 million job openings at the end of December. Claims have plunged from an all-time high of 6.149 million in early April 2020.
Last week's data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls portion of February's employment report. Claims are well below their 290,000 level in mid-January. The economy created 467,000 jobs in January.
Stocks on Wall Street slumped amid escalating tensions between the West and Russia over Ukraine. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell. 
MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT
A survey from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve on Thursday showed employment at factories in the mid-Atlantic region rose strongly in February, and manufacturers also increased hours for workers. But factory activity in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, grew moderately because of persistent supply constraints. 
Strong wages gains from the tight labor market and snarled supply chains are boosting inflation. 
Minutes of the Federal Reserve's Jan. 25-26 meeting published on Wednesday showed ""many"" officials at the U.S. central bank ""viewed labor market conditions as already at or very close to those consistent with maximum employment."" 
The Fed is expected to start raising interest rates in March to quell inflation, with economists anticipating as much as seven hikes this year.
The claims report also showed that the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 26,000 to 1.593 million in the week ended Feb. 5. 
""There are no signs here of a change in labor market trends,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
Freezing temperatures depressed homebuilding in January. A third report from the Commerce Department showed housing starts dropped 4.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.638 million units last month.
Temperatures were below average from the Midwest and Tennessee Valley to the Northeast in January, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information. 
Single-family housing starts, which account for the biggest share of homebuilding, tumbled 5.6% to a rate of 1.116 million. Starts fell in the Northeast, Midwest and South, but rose in the West. Last month's decline is, however, probably temporary as building permits rose 0.7% to a rate of 1.899 million units, the highest since May 2006. Single-family permits surged 6.8% to a rate of 1.205 million units, a one-year high. 
The supply of previously owned homes on the market is at record lows. But builders are facing challenges from soaring prices for inputs. 
Prices for softwood lumber, which is used for framing, shot up 25.4% in January, government data showed this week. 
The National Association of Homebuilders said on Wednesday that building material production bottlenecks were delaying projects, noting that ""many builders are waiting months to receive cabinets, garage doors, countertops and appliances.""
The supply squeeze was underscored by a surge in the backlog of houses approved for construction but not yet started to a record last month.
Rising mortgage rates could also slow demand for housing, especially among first-time buyers. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate jumped above 4% last week for the first time since 2019, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

""Rising mortgage rates pose a significant risk to housing demand, but it's unclear what type of lag would exist for this impact to appear in the construction data,"" said Isfar Munir, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
""New homes can be sold before they are started, and last-bid attempts to buy homes before mortgage rates increase further could boost new home sales before the Fed actually begins hiking, this would be a positive tailwind for housing starts, at least for a few months.""

Housing starts dropped 4.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.638 million units last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Data for December was revised slightly up to a rate of 1.708 million units from the previously reported 1.702 million units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts would fall to a rate of 1.700 million units.
Permits for future homebuilding in January rose 0.7% to a rate of 1.899 million units, the highest since 2006.

MADRID (Reuters) - Exports of Spanish goods soared 21.2% last year to surpass pre-pandemic levels despite global supply chain problems and the impact of Brexit, although Spain's trade deficit nearly doubled due to soaring energy prices, customs data on Thursday showed.
Helped by oil products, food and pharmaceuticals, 2021 exports hit around 317 billion euros ($360 billion), 9.1% higher than in 2019, when global trade was flowing normally before the COVID-19 pandemic.
Overall imports rose almost 25% to 343 billion euros. Spain's trade deficit nearly doubled to 26 billion euros from 2020. Excluding energy products, the trade deficit would stand at just 852 million euros versus a surplus of 1.1 billion euros in 2020.
Exports to Britain were still 5.4% below 2019 levels and imports of British goods have fallen by 26% after the country's exit from the European Union in January 2021, with some border controls yet to be implemented.
A senior source from the department of Commerce told Reuters the easing of trade tensions between Europe and the United States also helped the Spanish exports recovery, as well as a lesser dependence on markets most affected by supply problems such as Asia.
Spain was one of the countries affected by the tariffs imposed in the US-EU Airbus dispute, and in a row over taxes on big tech companies.
By type of traded goods, only the auto sector performed below 2019 levels, with an 8.5% drop in exports and a 19.5% slump in imports, largely due to global shortages of semiconductors that have led to temporary closures of some factories.
Vaccines against COVID-19 also helped boost Spain's exports thanks to pharmaceutical plants in the country producing vials.

In total, 5.5 billion euros worth of vaccines were imported in 2021 and 4.7 billion euros were exported.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan ran its biggest trade deficit in a single month in eight years in January as high energy costs swelled imports and manufacturers struggled with global supply constraints, causing a decline in car shipments.
The growing trade deficit highlights the world's third-largest economy's vulnerability to soaring commodity costs and slowing demand from giant neighbour China as the economy there struggles to maintain momentum.
Imports soared 39.6% year-on-year in January to hit a record high in terms of their value in yen, coming to 8.5231 trillion yen ($73.81 billion), Ministry of Finance data showed on Thursday, above a median market forecast for a 37.1% increase. 
That greatly outstripped a 9.6% rise in exports in the year to January, bringing the trade balance to a deficit of 2.1911 trillion yen, its biggest in a single month since January 2014.
The deficit was much bigger than the median estimate for a 1.607 trillion yen shortfall.
""Exports tend to go down in January due to seasonal factors as factory operation rates are usually low due to New Year holidays,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
""So it's easy for the trade balance to go in the red in the month, but the deficit was still large, even when taking that into account.""
A big factor in the deficit was a decline in car exports, said Tsunoda, which swung into contraction from an expansion in the previous month.
Manufacturers including  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Suzuki Motor Corp have been forced to temporarily close some plants after facing supply chain disruptions and pressure from a record surge in COVID-19 infections at home.
Imports were pushed up by surging incoming shipments of petroleum, coal and liquefied natural gas.
CHINA-BOUND EXPORTS FALL
By region, exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, shrank 5.4% in the 12 months to January, posting its first contraction in 19 months, while imports jumped 23.7% to post their largest rise in four months.
That was likely in part due to slower exports and a front-loading of demand ahead of China's week-long Lunar New Year holiday that started on the last day of January.
A bigger cause of worry was the slowing momentum of China's massive economy, which is facing weakening consumption and a property downturn, some analysts said.
""China's economic slowdown could weaken exports going forward,"" said Ryosuke Katagi, market economist at Mizuho Securities.
U.S.-bound shipments, another key market for Japanese goods, grew 11.5% in January, as stronger machinery shipments outweighed a fall in car exports. 
Separate government data showed core machinery orders, which serve as a leading indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, were up 3.6% in December from the prior month, better than an expected 1.8% fall.
Manufacturers expected core orders to decline 1.1% in January-March, after a 6.5% gain in the previous quarter. 

Japan's economy grew slightly less than expected in the final quarter of 2021 as falling coronavirus cases helped prop up consumption, government data showed on Tuesday, though a record surge in Omicron variant cases and the high raw material prices are clouding the outlook.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's unemployment rate held at a 13-year low in January as a surge in coronavirus cases took more of a toll on hours worked than on jobs, and hiring still rising moderately in the month.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Thursday showed employment rose 12,900 in January, pipping forecasts of a flat outcome and following two months of exceptional gains.
The unemployment rate stayed at 4.2%, matching the lowest reading since 2008 when it bottomed out at 4.0%. The impact of the Omicron wave was felt most in hours worked which slid 8.8% as employees stayed home sick or were forced to isolate.
Yet these workers remained attached to their jobs and unemployment barely moved, setting the stage for a quick rebound now that coronavirus cases have tapered off.
""As cases have fallen sharply we expect the impact on the labour market to fade in February,"" said Ben Udy, an economist at Capital Economics.
""It highlights the resilience of the labour market and supports our forecast that the RBA will hike rates in June.""
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has been aiming to drive unemployment to 4% or lower in the hope of reviving wage growth after years of sub-par growth, and is now near that goal.
The tightening labour market combined with rising inflation also suggests a rate rise is getting closer. RBA Governor Philip Lowe last week said it was plausible a hike could come later in the year should the economy recover as expected.
Markets are wagering the 0.1% cash rate could rise to 0.25% as early as June, and keep climbing to 1.25% by year end. Among the major local banks, CBA is tipping a first rise in June, Westpac sees August, ANZ September and NAB November.
Much will depend on how wages progress with the ABS wage price measure for the December quarter due next week. Analysts look for an uptick to 2.4%, which would be the fastest pace since 2014 but short of the 3%-plus desired by the RBA.
Still, the central bank recently emphasised it was looking at a wider suite of labour cost indicators and not just wages to decide when to tighten policy.
Analysts took that as a sign the RBA could hike even with wages running at less than 3%.
""ABS data, private surveys and our internal data that captures salaries paid into CBA bank accounts indicates that wages growth has further accelerated,"" says Gareth Aird, CBA's head of Australian economics.

He also expects the consumer price report for the March quarter to show an alarming acceleration in core inflation to 3.5%, up from 2.6% and above the RBA's 2-3% target band.
""We expect the RBA to move to an explicit hiking bias at the May Board meeting and raise rates to 0.25% in June,"" said Aird.

369,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 08:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s economy unexpectedly added jobs last month while unemployment held up, underscoring the resilience of the labor market in the face of a renewed coronavirus outbreak.
Employment increased by 12,900 roles in January from a month earlier, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed Thursday. Unemployment was steady at 4.2% despite participation edging up. The impact of the omicron variant of coronavirus was seen in hours worked, which dropped by 8.8%.
Australian bonds advanced after the jobs numbers, bringing the three-year yield down two basis points to 1.63%. The Aussie dollar edged lower to 71.96 U.S. cents. Futures traders trimmed bets that the Reserve Bank will hike interest rates in May to about 60%, from 80% odds seen on Tuesday.
“Nationally, and in New South Wales and Victoria, the number of people who worked reduced hours because they were sick was around three times the pre-pandemic average for January,” said Bjorn Jarvis, head of labor statistics at the ABS. “In other states and territories, it was twice as many people.”
The survey was conducted in the first two weeks of January, at the peak of the omicron wave when Australia had about 800,000 active Covid-19 cases.
The strength of Australia’s labor market is a key reason why economists and financial markets expect the RBA will begin raising rates in coming months. Governor Philip Lowe, by contrast, reckons it will take time for low unemployment to translate into much faster wages growth, suggesting a tightening cycle remains some way off.
RBA Says Pickup in Wages Growth Likely to Be ‘Only Gradual’ (1)
Figures from the National Skills Commission this week showed the Internet Vacancy Index climbed 4.4% last month to a 13-year high. Over the year to January, recruitment activity is up nearly 41% with advertisements at all-time highs in 10 occupations.
The RBA forecasts unemployment will this year fall below 4%, a level unseen since the early 1970s, though wages growth is only seen lifting to 3% in 2023. Lowe wants faster wages growth in order to sustainably return inflation to its 2-3% target before he begins raising rates after a prolonged period of weak consumer-price growth.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased by the most in 10 months in January, lifting the level of sales to a record high amid a surge in purchases of motor vehicles and other goods, but higher prices could limit the boost to economic growth this quarter.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed underlying strength in the economy ahead of anticipated interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve starting in March, although retail sales in December were much weaker than initially estimated.
""The strong rebound in January retail sales, though partly in response to last year's weak finish and inflated by higher prices, suggests consumers still have plenty in the tank to propel the expansion forward this year,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""Rate hikes won't cool their jets for a while, making the Fed's job of driving down inflation that much harder.""
Retail sales surged 3.8% last month, the largest rise since last March. That raised sales to their highest level since the government started tracking the series in 1992. 
Data for December was revised down to show sales declining 2.5% instead of 1.9% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would rise 2.0%, with estimates ranging from as low as 0.7% to as high as 4.4%.
Retail sales increased despite consumer sentiment sagging to a decade low in recent months. Spending is being supported by massive savings, high household wealth and a tightening labor market, though inflation is eroding wage gains. 
The broad increase in sales was led by motor vehicles. 
Auto sales typically fall in January after the holiday promotional season. Given the ongoing scarcity of motor vehicles because of a global shortage of semiconductors, the drop last month was probably smaller than had been expected by the seasonal factors, the model used by the government to iron out seasonal fluctuations in data. 
That likely resulted in the seasonal factors being more generous than in previous years. Unadjusted auto sales were the highest for the month of January going back to 1992.
Economists expect this boost to fade in March. Auto sales could also fall, with a separate report from the Fed on Wednesday showing motor vehicle production declined in January for a second straight month. That curbed overall growth in manufacturing output to 0.2% last month.
""Despite some caveats to the retail sales report, at least we can be assured that consumers are not pulling back their crucial support for the economy even though they are experiencing a marked decline in confidence if not being downright depressed about what the future holds,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.
Stocks on Wall Street fell as investors worried the strong retail sales could give the U.S. central bank ammunition to aggressively tighten monetary policy. 
Financial markets are pricing in nearly even odds of a 50-basis-point interest rate increase next month. Economists expect as many as seven rate hikes this year.
Minutes of the Fed's Jan. 25-26 meeting published on Wednesday showed decisions to raise rates would depend on a meeting-by-meeting analysis of data.
The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies while U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
BROAD GAINS
Retail sales last month were also lifted by higher prices because of shortages amid strained supply chains. They are mostly made up of goods and are not adjusted for inflation. 
Retail sales - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/egvbkldkapq/retailsales.png 
Economists estimated that retail sales rose about 2.8% in January when adjusted for inflation, which put them back in line with their pre-pandemic trend. 
Receipts at auto dealerships snapped back 5.7% after dropping 1.6% in December. Sales at electronics and appliance stores increased 1.9%. Building materials stores sales surged 4.1%. There were also gains in receipts at food and beverage stores as well as clothing retailers. 
But sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores fell 3.0%, suggesting consumers were cutting back on discretionary spending likely because of inflation. Sales at service stations fell 1.3% amid lower gasoline prices. 
Receipts at restaurants and bars dropped 0.9% as COVID-19 infections, driven by the Omicron variant, reduced mobility. Restaurants and bars are the only services category in the retail sales report. Online retail store sales surged 14.5%.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales soared 4.8% in January. Data for December was revised lower to show these so-called core retail sales falling 4.0% instead of 3.1% as previously reported.
Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
Economists estimated that inflation-adjusted core retail sales rose 2.7% last month. The so-called real core retail sales are what matter in the measurement of consumer spending growth.
January's solid real core retail sales suggested that consumer spending this quarter would probably not be as weak as economists had expected. Real consumer spending declined 1.0% in December, which had set consumption on a slower growth path.
""The recent volatility in the data makes it hard to detect the underlying trend, but the recent momentum for consumer spending now looks stronger than we were anticipating,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

Growth estimates for consumer spending are mostly below a 2.0% annualized rate. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 3.3% pace in the fourth quarter.
Economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) raised their first-quarter GDP growth estimate by 1.5 percentage points to a 2.0% rate. The economy grew at a 6.9% pace in the fourth quarter. Growth in 2021 was the strongest since 1984.

Import prices increased 2.0% last month, the largest rise since April 2011, after declining 0.4% in December, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. In the 12 months through January, prices accelerated 10.8% after rising 10.2% in December.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, advancing 1.3%.
The report followed news on Tuesday that producer prices increased by the most in eight months in January. Consumer prices also rose solidly last month, with the annual inflation rate posting its largest increase in 40 years.
Supply bottlenecks had shown signs of easing towards the end of 2021, but that progress stalled as COVID-19 cases, driven by the Omicron variant, raged around the globe. 
Imported fuel prices shot up 9.3% last month after decreasing 8.3% in December. Petroleum prices surged 9.5%, while the cost of imported food accelerated 3.6%. 
Excluding fuel and food, import prices rose 1.1%. These so-called core import prices gained 0.6% in December. They increased 6.2% on a year-on-year basis in January.

The report also showed export prices advanced 2.9% in January after dropping 1.6% in December. Prices for agricultural exports rose 3.0%. Nonagricultural export prices increased 2.9%.

372,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 10:36AM ET</span>",,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business inventories increased strongly in December, with motor vehicle stocks accelerating, a sign that the worst of the global semiconductor shortage was probably behind.
Business inventories increased 2.1% after rising 1.5% in November, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. December's increase was in line with economists' expectations. Inventories shot up 10.5% on a year-on-year basis in December.
Retail inventories surged 4.2% in December, instead of 4.4% as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 2.0% increase in November. 
Motor vehicle inventories accelerated 6.8% as estimated last month. They increased 4.2% in November.
That would suggest the global shortage of semiconductors, which has constrained motor vehicle production, was easing. But that improvement in supply has not been evident in producer inflation data, which showed wholesale motor vehicle and
equipment prices increasing a solid 0.7% in January. 
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, jumped 3.3%, rather than 3.6% as estimated last month.
Inventory investment increased at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of $173.5 billion in the fourth quarter, the second-largest quarterly increase on record.
Most economists see further scope for inventories to rise, noting that inflation-adjusted inventories remain below their pre-pandemic level. Sales-to-inventory ratios are also low.
Inventories contributed 4.90 percentage points to the fourth quarter's 6.9% annualized growth pace. Restocking, after three straight quarters during which inventories were drawn down, is supporting manufacturing.

Wholesale inventories increased 2.2% in December. Stocks at manufacturers rose 0.3%.
Business sales fell 0.7% in December after increasing 1.1% in November. At December's sales pace, it would take 1.29 months for businesses to clear shelves, up from 1.25 months in November.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada's annual inflation rate accelerated again in January to hit a fresh 30-year high at 5.1%, as food and housing costs continued to rise, official data showed on Wednesday, bolstering the case for a steady series of interest rates hikes.
January's figure is the highest since 5.5% recorded in September 1991 and the 10th consecutive month above the Bank of Canada's 1%-to-3% control range, Statistics Canada data showed. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected inflation to remain at 4.8% in January.
""It's hotter than expected,"" said Derek Holt, vice president of capital markets economics at Scotiabank. ""To me this suggests that the economy is moving on from Omicron's effects. 
""The restrictions may have added a little bit to the inflationary pressures. But there is certainly no slowdown,"" he added.
Shelter costs jumped 6.2% in January year-on-year, the fastest pace since February 1990, while food prices rose 5.7% as shopping for groceries became more expensive, both on supply chain issues and unfavorable growing conditions. 
With price gains widespread, it appears businesses are passing on cost increases to consumers, analysts said. Rising energy prices, Canada's record-smashing housing market, and wage pressure are set to send inflation still higher.
""Simply put, this is far too hot for comfort for the Bank of Canada, so expect a steady series of rate hikes in the coming meetings,"" Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note.
Porter expects four hikes in a row, to start, but added ""it may well require much more than that to bring inflation to heel.""
Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem has said interest rates need to rise to tackle hot inflation and Canadians should expect multiple hikes.
Still, analysts doubted the data would be enough to sway the central bank to hike by 50 basis points rather than 25 basis points at its March 2 policy meeting. Money markets see about a 30% chance of the larger increase.
""It's clear that central bankers need to tighten policy, but high household debt levels will temper the Bank of Canada's aggressiveness,"" Royce Mendes, head of macro strategy at Desjardins Group, said in a note.

The CPI common measure, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, rose to 2.3% from 2.1% in December.
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.2% higher at 1.2684 to the greenback, or 78.84 U.S. cents.

Manufacturing output gained 0.2% last month after dipping 0.1% in December, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory production rebounding 0.3%. Output increased 2.5% compared to January 2021.
Shortages of materials have also afflicted other segments of manufacturing, in addition to the motor vehicle industry.
Spending shifted towards goods from services during the COVID-19 pandemic, but manufacturers have struggled to cope amid an acute shortage of workers on factory floors and other places along the supply chain, caused by the coronavirus.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, remains supported by still-lean inventories at businesses as demand for goods remains strong.
Production at auto plants fell 0.9% last month after slipping 0.4% in December. Excluding motor vehicles, manufacturing increased 0.3% in January.
Last month's gain in manufacturing output combined with a record 9.9% jump in utilities to boost industrial production 1.4%. That followed a 0.1% fall in December.
Demand for utilities was boosted by freezing temperatures in many parts of the country in January. Mining production increased 1.0%, with oil and gas well drilling advancing 6.2%.
Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, rose 0.1 percentage point to 77.3% in January. It is 1.8 percentage points higher than its pre-pandemic level but still 0.8 percentage point below its long-run average.

Overall capacity use for the industrial sector increased 1.0 percentage point to 77.6% last month. It is 1.9 percentage points below its 1972-2021 average.
Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

375,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 08:47AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's inflation rate hit its highest since March 1992 in January when it rose to 5.5% and is expected to extend its climb to above 7% in April, prompting fears of the sort of wage-price spiral that once dogged the country's economy.
Here are five things that have changed the inflation picture since the early 1990s.
BANK OF ENGLAND - The British central bank was only given an inflation target in October 1992, after the country fell out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism which had kept sterling pegged against a basket of other European currencies.
The central bank gained full operational independence in 1997, taking responsibility for supporting or slowing the economy via interest rates out of the hands of politicians. Since then, inflation has averaged roughly 2% a year.
THE LAWSON BOOM - Britain's economy boomed in the late 1980s and sweeping tax cuts by Margaret Thatcher's finance minister Nigel Lawson were blamed for a sharp rise in inflation. Current finance minister Rishi Sunak has overseen the biggest-ever peacetime borrowing surge to prop up the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the tax burden is now on course to hit its highest since the 1960s.
WAGE DEALS - Another driver of Britain's high inflation three decades ago were strong wage increases that were secured by trade unions, which remained powerful players in the early 1990s despite a big decline in their membership over the previous decade. Wage increases have lagged behind inflation for much of the period since the global financial crisis of 2008-09.
STERLING - In March 1992, the pound was still part of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism which kept the currency pegged at a value that proved too high for the government and the Bank of England to defend against speculative attack six months later on ""Black Wednesday"". The de-pegging of the pound eventually set Britain's economy on course for a recovery.

INTEREST RATES - The BoE kept its base rate above 10% throughout much for the 1980s and it stood at 10.375% in March 1992. Bank Rate is currently about one-twentieth of that level at 0.5%. It is expected to rise as the BoE seeks to stamp out any long-term increase in inflation expectations, but only to about 2% in a year's time, according to interest rate futures markets. Private economists think it will peak lower than that.
CHINA - The rise of China and other low-cost manufacturing countries in the 2000s helped bring down inflation for consumers in rich economies around the world. But the gradual rise of costs in emerging economies, and more recently the disruption wrought by the coronavirus pandemic, has hammered global supply chains, pushing up prices for many goods.

376,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 08:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. retail sales jumped by the most in 10 months in January, rebounding from an end-of-year slump. 
The value of overall purchases rose 3.8% in January after a downwardly revised 2.5% drop in the prior month, Commerce Department figures showed Wednesday. The figures aren’t adjusted for inflation. 
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for a 2% advance in overall retail sales from the prior month.
The broad-based advance in sales underscores the resiliency of Americans’ demand for merchandise. While the omicron variant and related surge in Covid-19 infections likely dampened services spending in the month, an improving labor market has helped consumers continue to spend on things like cars and furniture despite decades-high inflation and a collapse in confidence.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Israel's economy grew at its fastest pace in 21 years in 2021 as consumer spending, exports and investment rebounded with double-digit gains following a pandemic-stifled 2020, raising the spectre of the central bank raising interest rates soon. 
The economy grew 8.1% last year, the Central Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday, well above the Bank of Israel's forecast of 6.5% and a sharp rebound from a 2.2% contraction in 2020.
The bureau noted growth in Israel last year was one of the strongest globally and compared with an OECD average of 5.3%.
The central bank projects growth of 5.5% in 2022. It has said it is in no rush to start raising short-term interest rates but that faster-than-expected growth and rising inflation could prod policymakers to join peers in the United States and Europe in hiking rates.
Israel's benchmark rate stands at 0.1%.
""These are very robust (GDP) numbers reflecting strong economic activity towards the end of 2021, which is supportive for a rate hike, most likely on April 11th,"" said Leader Capital Markets chief economist Jonathan Katz.
The next rate decision is due on Monday.
On Tuesday, the bureau said the annual inflation rate rose to 3.1% in January - breaking above the government's 1-3% target range for the first time in more than a decade.
Like most countries, Israel in 2020 was hurt by the pandemic and a series of lockdowns to contain the spread of COVID-19. But in 2021, a rapid vaccination rollout allowed a reopening of much of the economy apart from the tourism sector.
Israel has only recently started to allow foreign tourists to enter the country again.
Consumer spending, which accounts for half of economic activity, rose by close to 12% in 2021, while exports - another key growth driver - gained nearly 14% despite a stronger shekel currency, while investment in fixed assets was up 10.5%.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, gross domestic product grew an annualised 16.6% in from the prior three months, according to a preliminary estimate, above the 5% growth anticipated in a Reuters poll of economists.
Private spending jumped 19.2%, while exports surged 26.3% and investment grew 14.1%. Government spending and imports also rose sharply during the last three months of the year.
Third-quarter GDP was revised to annualised growth of 6.7% from a prior 2.7% rate.

Growth in 2021 was the fastest in Israel since an 8.9% pace in 2000.
The shekel gained 1% against the dollar, while Tel Aviv shares were also up 1%.

378,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 07:12AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - The interest rate on the most popular U.S. home loan surged by the most in nearly two years last week, shooting above the 4% level for the first time since 2019 as financial markets anticipate that the Federal Reserve will respond to the highest inflation in a generation with an aggressive run of rate hikes.
The Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday said its weekly measure of the average contract rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage climbed to 4.05% in the week ended Feb. 11 from 3.83% a week earlier. That was the highest since October 2019 and the largest weekly increase since March 2020 when the onset of the coronavirus pandemic was roiling financial markets.
The Fed responded to the pandemic-induced recession by cutting its benchmark rate to near zero and buying trillions of dollars in government bonds and mortgage-backed securities, and mortgage rates fell to historic lows below 3%. 
But with the economy recovering, the job market nearing full employment and inflation running at the highest rate since the early 1980s, the Fed is now seen rapidly reining in that accommodation. Policymakers have signaled an initial rate hike at their upcoming meeting in mid-March, and officials are debating openly about how fast to proceed after that. 
That reset has driven up the yields on the Treasury securities that influence mortgage rates, and home financing costs have followed suit: MBA's 30-year contract rate has climbed roughly a full percentage point in about five months.

The rate rise is crimping application volumes for mortgage refinancings in particular, with MBA's refinancing index dropping to a two-year low and the refinancing share of all loan applications at the lowest level since July 2019.
Overall loan application volumes fell 5.4% last week and purchase applications dropped 1.2%.

LONDON (Reuters) -British consumer prices rose at the fastest annual pace in nearly 30 years last month, intensifying the squeeze on households and reinforcing the chances that the Bank of England will raise interest rates for a third meeting in a row.
The annual rate of consumer price inflation rose to 5.5% in January, the highest since March 1992, when Britain was emerging from a long period of inflation-feeding high wage deals. This was above most economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll for it to hold at December's 5.4% rate.
Earlier this month the Bank of England predicted inflation will peak at around 7.25% in April, when household energy bills are due to rise by more than half.
""This morning's upside surprise to UK inflation serves to underscore a recent global trend: higher and more persistent inflation has caught central banks on the back foot and opened the door to more interest rate hikes this year,"" said Ambrose Crofton, global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
U.S. consumer price inflation hit a 40-year high of 7.5% in January, while inflation in the euro zone was a record 5.1%.
The BoE has already raised rates twice since December - to 0.5% from 0.1% - and financial markets expect a further increase to 0.75% or 1% on March 17 after its next meeting.
Two-year British government bond yields hit their highest since 2011 shortly after the inflation data was released.
Financial markets expect BoE interest rates to rise to 2% by the end of 2022, though most economists say they will not get close to that level.
""There will probably then be another hike in May taking interest rates to 1.0%, but we think that's where the (BoE) committee will pause as the inflation outlook becomes more benign,"" said Thomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK.
The British central bank has said it does not expect inflation to return to its 2% target until early in 2024. The bulk of economists think inflation will fall faster.
Markets expect energy prices to fall sharply next year, and there are some signs of easing global supply chain pressures.
But working-age households are facing their biggest annual disposal income squeeze in 30 years - not least because Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government plans to put up payroll taxes for workers and businesses in April.
The opposition Labour Party - as well as some Conservative lawmakers - have called on the government to scrap the increase.
COSTLIER CLOTHING
January's pick-up in inflation reflected less seasonal discounting by retailers than a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said.
A record 6.3% annual rise in the prices for clothing and footwear added 0.2 percentage points to the CPI rate, while food and drink prices increased by 4.3%, the most since April 2013.
Petrol prices were lower than December, but are still 23.6% higher than a year earlier, while the cost of second-hand cars was 28.7% higher.
Core inflation, which excludes sometimes volatile prices for energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, rose to 4.4% in January from 4.2% in December, its highest since these records began in 1997.
Retail price inflation - a longer-running series which the ONS says is no longer accurate, but which is used in commercial contracts and to set interest payments for some government bonds - was the highest since March 1991 at 7.8% in January.

There were signs of further inflation pressure ahead as manufacturers increased prices by 9.9%, the biggest annual jump since September 2008 and above all forecasts in a Reuters poll. 
But the surge in manufacturers' raw material costs slowed slightly, rising by 13.6% which was down from 13.8% in December and a peak of more than 15% in November.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said industrial output in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 1.2% month-on-moth in December for a 1.6% year-on-year gain.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.3% monthly rise and a 0.5% annual decline.
Eurostat said the monthly increase was led by capital goods rising 2.6% from November, which helped offset shrinking production of energy and durable consumer goods.

But in year-on-year terms durable consumer goods showed a strong increase of 2.7%, behind only the output of non-durable goods which jumped 7.7%, while capital goods declined 1.0%.
Industrial output is an important component of gross domestic product, which rose 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the October-December period for a 4.6% year-on-year expansion.

381,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 02:41AM ET</span>",,,,,,"OSLO (Reuters) -Norway's mainland economy grew last year by 4.2%, its quickest pace since 2007 as the country rebounded from a pandemic-driven slump in activity, Statistics Norway (SSB) data showed on Wednesday.
The October-December quarter saw growth of 1.4% compared with the July-September period, the statistics office said, beating expectations of 1.2% in a Reuters poll of analysts.
The crown currency strengthened against the euro to trade at 10.0950 at 0717 GMT, from 10.1080 just before the data release.
Mainland GDP, which excludes the often volatile impact from Norway's oil and gas production, is the most commonly watched measure of how the economy is performing.
In 2020, it contracted by 2.3% in what was estimated to be the weakest development in 75 years as strict COVID-19 lockdown measures hampered business activity.
Last year's growth was primarily driven by a rebound in a wide range of service industries that were hard hit in the initial stage of the pandemic, the statistics office said.
""In April of 2021, the gradual reopening of society began, and activity in the mainland economy grew each month from April to November,"" SSB economist Paal Sletten said in a statement.
Many restrictions were brought back in December however to help combat the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, causing a slowdown in the final month of the year, SSB said.
Norway in recent weeks again scrapped most curbs however, setting the stage for bars, restaurants, entertainment venues and other activities to resume full business.
""Society has reopened and the conditions for further normalisation are thus present,"" Sletten said.

The Norwegian central bank, which began raising rates last year, plans to hike three times in 2022, and some economists believe the pace of tightening will be even quicker.
The third-quarter mainland GDP reading was revised up to 2.8% from 2.6% originally.

382,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 12:51AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's factory-gate inflation eased to its slowest pace in six months and consumer price growth also softened in January amid weakening property sector demand, new coronavirus curbs and government efforts to rein in surging materials costs.
The producer price index (PPI) increased 9.1% from a year ago, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement on Wednesday, slower than the 9.5% growth tipped by a Reuters poll and a 10.3% gain in December. It was the weakest pace since July.
While producer prices in the world's second-largest economy remain elevated thanks to critical supply issues and home and abroad, China's relatively benign consumer inflation contrasts with cost pressures seen in most other economies.
Analysts believe cooling inflation could provide room for the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to ease policy to support the slowing economy, even as major central banks elsewhere tighten policy.
""Inflation concerns are unlikely to hold back the (People's Bank of China) from more policy loosening measures,"" said Sheana Yue, China Economist at Capital Economics.
China's consumer price index (CPI) inched up 0.9% last month from a year earlier. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected a 1% rise following a 1.5% uptick in December.
""Lower inflation reflects the weak domestic demand,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, Chief Economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. ""Macro policies have turned more supportive but it takes time for the impact to be transmitted to the economy.""
The Chinese economy, particularly its vast manufacturing sector, has struggled with elevated production costs due to high global energy prices.
In January, coal mining and washing prices surged 51.3% year-on-year and oil and gas extraction prices jumped 38.2%.
China's state planner earlier this month said global inflation is likely to persist for some time, but expressed confidence in the country's ability to cope with abnormal price fluctuations.
The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said it expects producer price inflation to slow further this year while consumer price inflation picks up.
LUXURY TO EASE
The PBOC has cut interest rates and pumped cash into the financial system to lower borrowing costs, with more easing steps expected.
Capital Economics' Yue expects further policy rate cuts before the middle of the year.
The scope to ease is a rare luxury enjoyed by China, in contrast to developed central banks, which have either begun raising interest rates or are widely expected to this year.
At the same time, policymakers are wary of loosening credit conditions too much and too fast, which could re-ignite speculation-driven spikes in property prices.
The property sector has cooled due to curbs on borrowing by developers and increasingly wary buyers.

""On interest rate cuts, policymakers do not want to undo all the results they achieved last year in the property market,"" said Nie Wen, chief economist at Hwabao Trust.
""They finally managed to curb the fast-rising (property) prices, so any cuts to interest rates will be structural and aimed at supporting the real economy, rather than further stimulating the property market.""

Investing.com – China’s factory-gate inflation slowed to its slowest pace in six months in January 2022, thanks to government curbs bringing raw materials prices down.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that the producer price index (PPI) rose 9.1% year-on-year, slower than the 10.3% growth recorded in December 2021 and the 9.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com.
Consumer price inflation also slowed year-on-year. The NBS data showed China’s consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.9% year-on-year, slower than the increase of 1.5% recorded in December and the 1% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com.
The CPI grew 0.4% month-on-month, also slower than the 0.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and December’s 0.3% contraction.
China’s economy faces several headwinds in the year ahead, including a troubled property sector as well as weaker consumer confidence and spending as COVID-19 outbreaks lead to strict prevention and control measures.
However, the slow decrease in factory-gate price inflation from the 26-year high hit in October 2021 could cushion downstream firms struggling with high raw material costs and supply bottlenecks.
Although Inflation is expected to persist for some time globally, China’s ability to deal with abnormal price fluctuations has improved, the National Development and Reform Commission said earlier in the month.
The supply of coal, oil, and gas will be “guaranteed”, the country’s state planner added in articles released earlier in February. It also forecasts that the PPI would slow down further, while the CPI picks up, in 2022.
Investors also expect the People’s Bank of China to take further action to prop up a slowing economic recovery, with lowering inflation providing it the room to do so. The central bank already pumped a net CNY100 billion ($15.75 billion) into the banking system on Tuesday via its medium-term lending facility (MFL)."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese consumers' one-year forward expected inflation rate rose to 2.43% in February, a Consumer Affairs Agency survey showed on Wednesday, the highest since the survey started in December 2014.

It followed a reading of 2.16% in the previous month.

385,"<span>Feb 15, 2022 09:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s inflation eased in January, providing Beijing with more leeway to shore up the economy ahead of a key political leadership meeting later this year. 
The producer price index rose 9.1% from a year earlier, official data showed Wednesday, weaker than economists’ forecasts for a 9.5% increase and down from 10.3% in December. Consumer prices grew 0.9% last month from a year earlier, slower than a projected 1% increase.
A moderation in inflation in recent months has given the central bank scope to cut interest rates and pump liquidity into the financial system to support a faltering economy. Beijing shifted to a more pro-growth bias late last year as a property market slump and repeated virus outbreaks dragged down growth in the world’s second-largest economy. While the People’s Bank of China refrained from cutting interest rates this week, market watchers expect further reductions in coming months.
The retreat in factory-gate inflation in January was largely due to the high base of comparison a year earlier. Higher costs in January continued to squeeze manufacturers, with purchasing managers’ surveys showing both input and output price sub-indexes signaling faster gains.
On Tuesday Premier Li Keqiang repeated the government’s pledge to keep prices stable and help companies in downstream sectors ease cost pressures. Authorities should “attach great importance to solving the constraints in economic operations and stabilize market expectations,” the regular State Council meeting chaired by Li concluded.
Consumer inflation stayed subdued, despite a seasonal spike in demand around the Lunar New Year holidays, which began on the last day of January this year. The reading was mainly dragged lower by food prices, which dropped 3.8% in January. Pork prices dropped at a faster pace of 41.6% and prices of fresh vegetables fell 4.1%. 
Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, rose 1.2%, the same as in November and December, a sign of subdued consumer demand. Confidence remained weak during the seven-day Lunar New Year break, a usually busy time for spending, with tourism revenue down 4% from the same period last year and 44% below 2019 levels. Services inflation rose 1.7% in January.  
Economists expect China’s factory-gate inflation to continue softening during the year to reach an average of 3.9% in 2022, as supply chain bottlenecks ease and because of comparisons with last year’s higher base. The nation’s top economic planner also predicts that PPI will ease gradually, with tighter monetary policy in the rest of the world helping to weaken the rally in global commodities. Consumer prices are expected to continue their mild gains, as supplies of important necessities are sufficient, the National Development and Reform Commission said in a statement this month.

The economy added 1,135,000 positions in January from a year earlier, an 11th straight month of gains, the statistics office said Wednesday. That’s the most since March 2000 when South Korea was cementing its recovery from the Asian financial crisis. The jobless rate declined to 3.6% from 3.8% in December, exceeding the 3.7% forecast of economists.
The latest data support the view that Koreans have adjusted to living with the virus, even as the omicron variant pushes daily cases to record highs. An extra budget to help support businesses through the current tough operating restrictions is pending in parliament.
Today’s result supports the view that the economy could withstand another interest-rate increase as the Bank of Korea tries to rein in inflation and normalize monetary policy. Most economists see the central bank standing pat this month, before hiking the rate again to 1.5% in the second quarter.
At the same time, a low base effect likely contributed to the annual hiring strength: South Korea’s economy shed 982,000 jobs in January 2021, the biggest year-on-year drop since 1998, at the peak of the Asian financial crisis.
Today’s data showed the medical and welfare industries led the employment gains, with 250,000 positions added in January. Construction, lodging and information technology industries also recorded increases. The financial and insurance industry shed jobs, along with the retail and wholesale sectors.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased by the most in eight months in January amid a surge in the cost of hospital outpatient care and goods such as food and motor vehicles, another sign that high inflation could persist through much of this year.
Broadening inflation pressures were underscored by other data on Tuesday showing a measure of prices received by factories in New York state surged to a record high in February, while manufacturers reported they continued to pay higher prices for inputs. The reports followed on the heels of news last week of a strong rise in consumer prices in January, with the annual inflation rate posting its largest increase in 40 years.
Financial markets have priced in a better-than-even chance that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month by half a percentage point. 
""This is further evidence of persistent and increasingly embedded inflationary pressure that should keep the Fed leaning towards even more hawkish policy,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""We continue to expect data over the next month will support a 50-basis-point hike by the Fed in March.""
The producer price index for final demand jumped 1.0% last month, the biggest advance since May, after climbing 0.4% in December, the Labor Department said. 
The PPI was boosted by a 0.7% increase in services, matching the gain in December.
Services were driven by a 1.6% rise in the cost of hospital outpatient care. There were also increases in wholesale retailing for machinery, vehicles, apparel, jewelry as well as footwear. The cost of hotel and motel accommodation rose as did freight transportation by trucks. 
Portfolio management fees jumped 1.9%. But margins for fuels and lubricants retailing fell 9.7%. Airline fares dropped 4.2%.
Wholesale goods prices rebounded 1.3% after dipping 0.1% in December. A 0.8% rise in the prices of goods excluding foods and energy accounted for more than 40% of the broad increase in the costs of goods. Motor vehicle prices rose 0.7%.
Food prices advanced 1.6%, while energy products increased 2.5%. But prices for iron and steel scrap fell 10.7%. Healthcare, portfolio and airline fares are key components in the calculation of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, one of the inflation measures watched by the Fed. 
In the 12 months through January, the PPI rose 9.7%. That followed a 9.8% surge in December. Year-on-year PPI is slowing as last year's large increases drop out of the calculation. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI would gain 0.5% on the month and advance 9.1% on a year-on-year basis.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as Russia's withdrawal of some troops near its border with Ukraine assuaged fears of a potential Russian invasion. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were trading largely lower. 
STRONG UNDERLYING INFLATION
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices rose 0.9% in January. That was the largest increase in the so-called core PPI in a year and followed a 0.4% gain in December. 
In the 12 months through January, the core PPI increased 6.9% after rising 7.0% in December.
Inflation is running well above the U.S. central bank's 2% target. Economists are expecting as many as seven rate hikes this year. Inflation pressures are also coming from strong wage gains amid tightening labor market conditions.
With the CPI and PPI data in hand, economists are estimating the core PCE price index rose by about 0.6% in January. That would result in the year-on-year rate increasing 5.2%, which would be the largest gain since early 1983. 
A shift in spending to goods from services during the COVID-19 pandemic and trillions of dollars in government pandemic relief boosted demand, which has outpaced supply, igniting inflation. An acute shortage of workers on factory floors and other places along the supply chain are making it difficult to get products to markets.
Though a survey from the New York Fed on Tuesday showed a solid improvement in employment at factories in the region, supply bottlenecks persisted, with delivery times continuing to lengthen. As a result, the survey's measure of prices paid by factories was little changed near its recent peak. 
Its gauge of prices received by manufacturers soared seventeen points to a record high of 54.1. High inflation and snarled supply chains left manufacturers less optimistic about business conditions over the next six months. The survey's measure of future business conditions dropped seven points to 28.2, the lowest reading since the early stages of the pandemic.
While the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) surveys and data on inventory accumulation have suggested some easing in supply constraints, that has not been evident in the PPI data.

""In the months ahead, the PPI will be an important bellwether to gauge if supply chain easing could lead to cooler consumer prices,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York. 
""We don't expect immediate pass-through, but an eventual slowing in producer price increases would be a sign firms are able to increase capacity to meet strong demand.""

389,"<span>Feb 15, 2022 08:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Prices paid to U.S. producers jumped in January by more than forecast, pointing to persistent inflationary pressures as companies contend with supply-chain and labor constraints.
The producer price index for final demand increased 9.7% from January of last year and 1% from the prior month, Labor Department data showed Tuesday. The gain from December was the largest in eight months. The median forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 9.1% year-over-year increase and a 0.5% monthly advance.
The figures, which reflected broad increases across categories, further reinforce the Federal Reserve’s intentions to begin raising interest rates next month amid mounting inflation throughout the economy. Transportation bottlenecks, robust demand and labor constraints experienced through 2021 have carried over into this year and risk keeping price pressures well-elevated.
The latest monthly advance indicates inflationary pressures in the production pipeline remain intense, which will continue to filter through into final costs of consumer goods and services.
Data last week showed that consumer prices surged in January by more than forecast, sending the annual inflation rate to a fresh four-decade high. 
Following the CPI report, some Fed officials came out in favor of more aggressive policy action at the central bank’s March meeting. But centrists among the top Fed officials appear skeptical of a half-point hike, and have suggested that there is little need to start a hiking cycle with a half percentage point move move.

The cost of energy rebounded in January after falling a month earlier, rising 2.5%. So far this month, crude oil and other energy prices have continued to climb on risks that a Russian attack on Ukraine would prompt serious sanctions by western governments.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core PPI increased 0.8% from a month earlier and was up by a 8.3% from a year ago. 
Prices of goods accelerated in January from a month earlier, rising 1.3%, the most in three months. 
The cost of services advanced 0.7%, matching the prior month. The report captures changes in prices paid to producers as well as margins received by wholesalers and retailers. A major factor in the January increase in the index for final demand services was hospital outpatient care prices, which rose 1.6%.
Producer prices excluding food, energy, and trade services -- a measure often preferred by economists because it strips out the most volatile components -- rose 0.9% from December, the most in a year. Compared with a year earlier, the gauge advanced 6.9%.
Costs of processed goods for intermediate demand, which reflect prices earlier in the production pipeline, rose 1.7% from a month earlier. Compared with a year earlier, the measure was up 24.1%.

The ZEW economic research institute said its economic sentiment index rose to 54.3 from 51.7 in January. A Reuters poll had pointed to a rise to 55.0.
""The economic outlook for Germany continues to improve in
February despite growing economic and political uncertainties,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement.
""Financial market experts expect an easing of pandemic-related restrictions and an economic recovery in the first half of 2022. They still expect inflation to decline, albeit at a slower pace and from a higher level than in previous months,"" he added. ""Consequently, more than 50% of the experts now predict that short-term interest rates in the euro area will rise in

The 12-month inflation rate declined in January for the first time since February 2021, data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) showed.
Prices of housing and utilities were 18.1% higher than in January 2020, but 5 percentage points lower than the 12-month increase recorded in December, INE said in its more detailed second reading. 
Most notably, the year-on-year electricity prices increase in January was lower than in December as a severe snow storm in central Spain caused a peak of demand in January last year.
Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was 2.4% year on year, the highest since 2012 and up from a reading of 2.1% a month earlier, the National Statistics Institute data showed.
Even though it has slowed in January, the inflation rate in Spain was still faster than the rate in the euro zone as a whole, which stood at 5.1%. 

The group's inflation in January hit a record high, defying expectations for a big drop and piling pressure on the European Central Bank to finally admit that price growth is not as temporary and benign as it has long predicted.
However, ECB chief economist Philip Lane reiterated last week that record-high inflation rate in the euro zone was temporary.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat confirmed its earlier estimate that gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the October-December period for a 4.6% year-on-year increase.
At the same time euro zone employment rose 0.5% quarter-on-quarter for 2.1% year-on-year rise, as expected by economists polled by Reuters.
Eurostat data also showed that a jump in energy prices hit the euro zone's trade balance hard pushing it into a seasonally unadjusted trade deficit of 4.6 billion euros in December from a surplus o 28.3 billion a year earlier as exports rose 14.1% while imports surged 36.7%.
Adjusted for seasonal swings, the euro zone trade deficit was even larger at 9.7 billion euros in December, up from a 1.8 billion gap in November and surpluses throughout the rest of 2021.

The more expensive energy boosted the European Union's energy trade deficit to a whopping 276.7 billion euros in 2021, up from 157.2 billion in 2020.
Europe's trade gap with its biggest energy supplier Russia more than quadrupled to 69.2 billion euros last year from 15.7 billion in 2020. The trade deficit with Norway, also a major EU energy supplier, swing to a 18 billion deficit from a 6.1 billion surplus in 2020.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's economy rebounded in the final three months of 2021 as falling coronavirus cases helped prop up consumption, though rising raw material costs and a spike in new Omicron variant infections cloud the outlook.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda also highlighted escalating tensions in Ukraine as a fresh risk to the central bank's forecast for a moderate economic recovery.
The world's third-largest economy expanded an annualised 5.4% in October-December after contracting a revised 2.7% in the previous quarter, government data showed on Tuesday, falling short of a median market forecast for a 5.8% gain.
Some analysts expect the economy to slump again in the current quarter as rising COVID-19 cases keep households from shopping and supply chain disruptions hit factory output.
""The economy will likely stall in January-March or it could even contract, depending on how the Omicron variant affects service-sector consumption,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Economic growth was driven largely by a 2.7% quarter-on-quarter rise in private consumption, which accounts for more than half of Japan's gross domestic product (GDP).
The expansion in consumer spending, which was bigger than market forecasts for a 2.2% gain, came after Japan ended coronavirus curbs in October.
Capital expenditure also rose 0.4%, roughly in line with market forecasts. External demand added 0.2% point to growth, a sign exports continued to benefit from the global recovery.
""As the economy re-opened, service consumption, such as for hotels, restaurants and entertainment, got a big boost,"" said Wakaba Kobayashi, an economist at Daiwa Institute of Research.
Japan's recovery, however, continues to lag other advanced economies, forcing the BOJ to keep monetary policy ultra-loose, even as other central banks eye interest rate hikes.
The country's seasonally-adjusted real GDP, sized around 541 trillion yen ($4.69 trillion), remains below the pre-pandemic level of late 2019.
A record spike in Omicron cases forced the government to impose loose curbs on most areas and keep borders closed, which likely dampened consumption since the outset of this year.
Rising infections have also forced some manufacturers to halt production, causing output disruptions and delivery delays at auto giants such as  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp.
Meanwhile, creeping import costs add risks to Japan's fragile recovery.
""Heightening tensions in Ukraine could have unfavourable effects on global and Japanese growth if they spark a surge in fuel and commodity prices,"" BOJ governor Kuroda told parliament on Tuesday.
Hiroshi Shiraishi, senior economist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Securities, expects economic growth to slow to an annualised pace of 1-1.5% in January-March, or even decline.
""The economy's recovery could delay into later this year as the Ukraine crisis may drive up fuel costs and dampen corporate appetite for capital expenditure,"" he said.

""There's not much left for the government and the central bank to do in terms of new stimulus measures. Both fiscal and monetary policy have reached a limit.""

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's labour market is flashing some warning signs for a central bank on guard against a wage-inflation spiral, economists said on Tuesday after official data showed a shrinking workforce and record levels of vacancies.
Annual pay growth in the final quarter of 2021 picked up to 4.3% from 4.2% in the three months to November, reflecting bigger Christmas bonuses than a year ago.
The increase was above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists and the Bank of England's prediction.
The central bank's Monetary Policy Committee on Feb. 3 said it expected to tightening monetary policy again soon after raising interest rates for the second time in two months to curb surging inflation pressures. 
""December's pick-up in wage growth will maintain the pressure on the MPC to hike the Bank Rate again at next month's meeting,"" Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note to clients.
James Smith, at ING, said pay growth appeared to have stabilised at its pre-pandemic levels that were consistent with a tight jobs market.
""However, we still doubt that the UK is headed for a wage-price spiral that would justify the six rate hikes markets are now expecting from the BoE this year,"" Smith said.
The highest inflation in nearly 30 years means that in real terms pay fell in the three months to December for the first time since mid-2020, when many employees were on reduced furlough pay, according to the Office for National Statistics' preferred CPIH inflation measure.
The squeeze on living standards is a challenge for Prime Minister Boris Johnson who has authorised financial support for households to meet surging energy bills. 
BoE Governor Andrew Bailey drew criticism from unions and a rebuff from Downing Street when he said this month that workers should rein in pay demands or risk a wage-inflation spiral. 
Job vacancies hit a new high of just under 1.3 million while the share of inactive working-age people who wanted a job held at a record low.
Many older workers have dropped out of the labour force during the pandemic and there are few good estimates of how many European Union workers have permanently left Britain since Brexit. ONS data shows almost 600,000 fewer people working in Britain than before the pandemic.
ONS data showed employment was down by 38,000 in the October-to-December period, the biggest fall since the three months to February last year when Britain under was under a tough coronavirus lockdown.
But a month-by-month breakdown, which the ONS cautions can be volatile, showed employment in December surged after falling in October and November, suggesting the Omicron wave of COVID-19 cases had not hurt the jobs market.

Britain's unemployment rate for the three months to the end of December held at 4.1%, as expected by most economists polled by Reuters. 
A preliminary estimate of the number of staff on businesses' payrolls in January rose by 108,000, suggesting the hiring momentum continued into 2022 although the figure was slower than December's increase of 131,000 which itself was revised down from an original reading of 184,000.

The euro zone's fifth largest economy expanded 4.8% over the whole of 2021, which made up for the unprecedented decline of 3.8% a year before when strict lockdowns crippled production and demand.
Growth last year was mainly fuelled by a boom in consumer spending as the country opened up gradually from April to October, when the rise of the Delta variant threatened to swamp hospitals again with COVID-19 cases.
Consumer spending, however, fell 0.1% in the final three months of 2021 as coronavirus restrictions were reintroduced, while business investments went up almost 3%. 

Bars and restaurants have been allowed to reopen again under strict conditions earlier this year, and the government last week said it intends to remove most coronavirus restrictions by the end of the month.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's export growth slowed more than expected in January, after authorities in the world's top thermal coal exporter banned coal shipments, a move that shocked the global energy market.
The January trade surplus was bigger than expected at $930 million, however, official data showed on Tuesday, compared with a $190 million surplus seen in a Reuters poll, as imports rose more slowly than predicted.
Indonesia on Jan. 1 suspended coal exports due to low inventory at power plants. Shipments resumed gradually from Jan. 10 but the ban still applies to miners not compliant with domestic sales requirements.
The resource-rich country has recorded a trade surplus every month since May 2020 due to an upward trend in commodity prices as countries lift COVID-19 restrictions.
January's exports grew 25.31% annually, short of the 33.86% expected in a Reuters poll and the slowest increase in the past year. Total exports were valued at $19.16 billion, the smallest since June.
Exports of products classified as mineral fuel - much of which is coal - dropped by $2 billion from December, with shipments to China, India and the Philippines most affected. 
Tin exports fell $259 million in January from a month earlier, due to delays issuing export permits.
Meanwhile, imports increased 36.77% to $18.23 billion, compared to 51.38% expected in the poll.
""I see this as a good situation, that even without the support of coal in January we could still book a surplus. This means with the reopening of exports in February, we will see surplus soaring,"" said Trimegah Securities economist Fakhrul Fulvian.

Bank Danamon economist Wisnu Wardana said consumer goods imports were typically weaker early each year and vaccine purchase was low in January, but imports continue to rise, pressuring the trade surplus.
""Demand will accelerate more in 2H22, which will be followed by a widening current account deficit to 1.9% of GDP this year and a higher volatility of the rupiah,"" he said.

(Reuters) -U.S. consumers lowered their expectations for how much inflation will rise in the near-term and medium-term periods, signaling that inflation concerns may be easing, according to a survey released on Monday by the New York Federal Reserve.
One-year inflation expectations decreased for the first time since October 2020, dropping to a median of 5.8% in January from 6.0% in December, according to the New York Fed's monthly survey of consumer expectations. Inflation expectations three years out declined to 3.5% in January from 4.0% in December, showing the largest monthly drop since the survey was launched in 2013. 
Consumers also said they expect the cost of food, rent, gas, and medical care to rise more slowly in the year ahead, according to the survey. Despite the decrease in inflation expectations, both short-term and medium-term expectations remained above pre-pandemic levels, the survey found.
U.S. central bank officials are watching inflation expectations closely and are under more pressure to act after data released last week showed that prices increased 7.5% on a year-on-year basis in January, the fastest annual pace in 40 years.

However, new research released on Monday in a blog post co-authored by New York Fed President John Williams found that inflation surprises are having a smaller influence on medium-term and long-term inflation expectations now than they did before the COVID-19 pandemic.
""These findings indicate that consumers are taking less signal than before the pandemic from inflation news in updating their longer-term expectations, and that they do not view the current elevated inflation as very long-lasting,"" researchers wrote.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's wholesale price index stayed in the double digits in January, for the 10th month in a row, as firms grapple with rising input costs and more pass on higher prices to consumers.
Wholesale prices in January rose 12.96% from a year earlier, less than the previous month's 13.56%, government data showed on Monday. It was higher than the 12.70% forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts, in part due to higher food prices - up 9.55% on the year, versus 9.24% in December.
Rising input costs for products such as fuel, metals and chemicals have pushed up wholesale prices, a proxy for producer prices. Headline retail inflation is hovering around 5.5%, still within the Reserve Bank of India's 2%-6% target.
Many economists have warned that despite RBI's estimates of inflationary pressures easing, rising oil and food prices pose a risk to inflation. 
""The continuous hardening in crude oil prices exacerbated by the ongoing geopolitical concerns, and its impact on the rupee, poses the biggest risk to the WPI inflation trajectory in the ongoing quarter,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at rating agency ICRA, the Indian arm of Moody's (NYSE:MCO). 
RBI's monetary policy committee (MPC) left the benchmark repo rate unchanged at 4.0% last week, while sticking to its accommodative policy stance to help the economy recover from the pandemic. 
The central bank has slashed the repo rate by a total of 115 basis points (bps) since March 2020 to soften the blow from the coronavirus pandemic and tough containment measures. The rate is now 250 bps below the level at the beginning of 2019, when the easing cycle began.
Consumer price-based inflation, the main gauge monitored by the monetary policy committee of the RBI, was at a five-month high of 5.59% in December.

Wholesale fuel and power prices in January rose 32.27% on year versus 32.30% in December, while manufactured product prices rose 9.55%, against 10.62% in the prior month.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's economic growth probably slowed in the final quarter of 2021, but is expected to have hit a new annual record after authorities lifted coronavirus curbs and adopted expansive policies, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
According to the median forecast from 16 analysts, Colombia's fourth-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) is forecast to have grown 8.5% compared with the year earlier, slowing from 13.2% in the third quarter.
That would bring overall 2021 growth for Latin America's fourth-largest economy to a record 10% after it contracted 6.8% in 2020 during the worst of the pandemic's economic impact.
The Andean nation's growth was led by household consumption, with spending of savings accumulated during the pandemic, as well as strong fiscal spending and historically low interest rates, analysts said.
""A favorable external environment, the absence of restrictions on mobility ... and expansive macroeconomic policies on the fiscal and monetary front would've supported a significant recovery in GDP in 2021,"" said Itau bank analyst David Cubides.
The government's DANE statistics agency will publish the 2021 data on Feb. 15.
However, growth could slow to 4.1% this year, according to the poll's median forecast, with high inflation expected to prompt the central bank to further raise interest rates to rein in prices.
Additionally, the economy may also have to contend with lower fiscal spending and uncertainty ahead of presidential elections on May 29.
""Undoubtedly, politics will be key to economic performance this year and there is a non-negligible risk that it could affect recovery, as well as the medium-term outlook,"" Andres Pardo, the head of strategy for macroeconomics in Latin America for XP (NASDAQ:XP) Investments, said. Pardo added, strong oil prices positive investment climate should underpin growth.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level in more than a decade in early February amid expectations that inflation would continue to increase in the near term, but that was unlikely to derail spending against the backdrop of excess savings and a strengthening labor market recovery.
The decline in sentiment reported by the University of Michigan on Friday was entirely among households with incomes of $100,000 or more, which could reflect falling stock market prices.
It followed news on Thursday that consumer prices recorded their largest annual increase in 40 years in January, which prompted markets to price in a hefty 50 basis points interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve next month.
""But will this cool down consumer spending and crimp the recovery?"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""That's doubtful, given spending and sentiment diverged when government stimulus put hundreds of billions into consumers' bank accounts and spending rose while sentiment dropped. Much of that money is still there, as is pent-up demand for services.""
The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index dropped to 61.7 in the first half of this month, the lowest since October 2011, from a final reading of 67.2 in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index edging up to 67.5. 
The index is sensitive to gasoline prices and the stock market. It is, however, much weaker than most other sentiment measures, including the Conference Board, which is comfortably above levels hit during the first mandatory COVID-19 lockdowns in the spring of 2020. The Conference Board survey puts more weight on the labor market, which is rapidly churning out jobs.
""The continuing relative weakness in this measure of confidence seems overdone relative to fundamentals,"" said Scott Hoyt, a senior director for Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""A rebound is likely, and this index may rise more than some others. However, the timing is uncertain and likely depends on gasoline prices, infection rates, the stock market, broader inflation, and events in Washington and overseas.""
According to the University of Michigan sentiment among households with incomes of $100,000 or more dropped by 16.1% from last month. The impact of higher inflation on personal finances was spontaneously cited by one-third of all consumers, with nearly half of all consumers expecting declines in their inflation adjusted incomes during the year ahead, it said.
The survey's gauge of current economic conditions fell to a reading of 68.5, the lowest since August 2011 from 72.0 in January. Its measure of consumer expectations declined to 57.4, the lowest since November 2011, from 64.1 in January. 

The survey's one-year inflation expectations rose to 5.0%, highest since July 2008, from 4.9% in January. Its five-to-10-year inflation outlook held steady at an 11-year high of 3.1%.
""The Fed's view that inflation running slightly below 2% was a problem was one that consumers never saw as a problem, but consumers now see inflation as the problem,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain suffered a smaller economic hit than feared in December as COVID-19 cases mounted, capping a historic two-year collapse and rebound for the world's fifth-biggest economy, but surging inflation is set to slow the recovery in 2022.
Gross domestic product (GDP) fell 0.2% in December - as many people worked from home and avoided Christmas socialising due to the Omicron coronavirus variant - following growth of 0.7% the month before, official data showed.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.6% monthly fall.
The quarterly pace of expansion held steady at 1.0%, helped by the public health service, couriers and employment agencies.
December GDP matched its level in February 2020, just before the pandemic struck. Output in the fourth quarter was slightly below that in the final three months of 2019.
The economy grew 7.5% in 2021 - the biggest annual rise since 1941, when Britain was rearming during World War Two - after a 9.4% collapse in 2020, the largest since the aftermath of World War One.
The slump and rebound are the biggest among the Group of Seven rich nations, in part reflecting Britain's high number of COVID-19 deaths and reliance on consumer-facing services but also different conventions for measuring public-sector output.
COVID-19 infections have fallen sharply since the turn of the year and the Bank of England expects output, measured on a quarterly basis, will return to its pre-pandemic size by the end of March.
The central bank sees much greater headwinds from fast-rising inflation, which it expects to peak at a 30-year high of around 7.25% in April when domestic power tariffs will leap.
""The UK economy is facing a materially weaker 2022 as the crippling burden of rising inflation, soaring energy bills and higher taxes on consumers and businesses dampens activity,"" Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said.
The BoE has raised interest rates twice since December and investors are pricing in rates of 2% by the end of this year.
The BCC called on the government to scrap a planned rise in payroll taxes levied on workers and businesses - something finance minister Rishi Sunak has repeatedly ruled out.
SERVICES WITHOUT A SMILE
Services output fell 0.5% in December, driven by a 3.0% fall in consumer-facing services such as retail and hospitality. Output for consumer-facing services is still more than 8% below its pre-pandemic level.
Stripping out greater spending on healthcare, overall GDP would still be more than 1% below its pre-pandemic level.
Separate data showed Britain's trade deficit in goods and services widened to 28.8 billion pounds ($39.1 billion) last year from a 2.9 billion-pound surplus in 2020, although 2021's figure was broadly in line with deficits from 2015-2018.
Britain's goods trade deficit with the European Union fell to 70.2 billion pounds, its lowest since 2013, during the first year that new trading arrangements with the EU took effect.
British goods exports to the EU halved in January 2021, due to temporary disruptions from new customs arrangements and stockpiling in the months before. They are now broadly back at pre-Brexit levels, while imports are some way below.
Some economists warn that the drop in overall trade volumes with the EU is damaging and that British exporters are failing to keep up with a global boom in demand for manufactured goods, losing market share.

""While COVID has undoubtedly damaged trade, so too has the introduction of fresh trade barriers with the EU,"" said James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation think tank.

Prices rose by 0.2% from December as gas, hotel stays and used cars became more expensive, offsetting falling prices for private transport and for clothing and footwear amid seasonal sales, official statistics showed.
SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan said last month that central banks needed to take a global surge in inflation seriously, but that the SNB saw Swiss inflation near its peak.
He stuck to the SNB's forecast that Swiss inflation would be around 1% this year.
""Inflation was stronger than expected in Switzerland in January, although the upward surprise was not in the same league as that seen in the euro zone and Swiss inflation is still consistent with the SNB’s definition of price stability,"" Capital Economics analyst Michael Tran said in a note.
""In any case, January is likely to be the peak and we think that the headline rate will fall back below 1.0% over the coming months."" he added.

The SNB has used a -0.75% policy rate and currency intervention for years to curb the safe-haven Swiss franc's strength.
""While there isn’t much to trouble the SNB on the inflation front, the shift in the monetary backdrop has brought Swiss rate hikes onto the horizon,"" Tran said, forecasting the SNB could raise the policy rates back to zero by the end of 2023.

Exports last month rose 16.7% from a year earlier to $39.98 billion, the Ministry of Finance said on Friday.
A Reuters poll of analysts had forecast a rise of 17.2% for the month, compared with a 23.4% increase in December.
Exports rose 29.4% in 2021 to a record high, supported by robust global demand for the island's tech products from semiconductors to telecommunications equipment.
The ministry attributed the January growth to strong demand for tech exports such as electronic components as well as chips, a shortage of which has crippled car plants globally and is affecting consumer electronics.
Exports were also boosted by stockpiling ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday in the first week of February, it added.
Exports of electronics components rose 19.7% in January to reach $15.91 billion, with semiconductor exports growing 20.9% and telecommunication and audio-visual products gaining 14.3% from a year earlier.
Many companies expect chip shortages to last at least for the rest of the year, which will continue to fill Taiwanese semiconductor firms' order books.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) on Thursday reported a 35.8% on-year rise in net revenues for January to T$172.18 billion ($6.19 billion).
Firms such as TSMC are major suppliers to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other global tech giants, as well as providers of chips for auto companies and lower-end consumer electronics.
The finance ministry warned of risks ahead, including uncertainty over the COVID-19 pandemic as well as supply chain bottlenecks and China-U.S. frictions.
But it said Taiwan's first quarter exports could maintain double-digit growth, thanks to sustained global demand for tech products like chips along with a steady improvement in global economic fundamentals.
January exports to China, Taiwan's largest trading partner, grew an annual 5.7% to $15.70 billion, compared with a 16.2% on-year rise in December, while exports to the United States jumped 34.2%, faster than the 29% rise recorded the previous month.
Imports leapt 24.9%, in line with economists' expectations of a 25% rise, after an increase of 28.1% in December.

Taiwan could see February exports increase in the range of 13% to 15% from a year earlier, the ministry said.

The survey of almost 28,000 firms across all sectors showed that 64% of companies saw rising energy and raw material prices as a business risk, the highest ever recorded in a DIHK survey, compared to 58% in the organization's previous poll.
The balance of companies' positive and negative expectations also dropped to five points from 10, compared to the long-term average of seven points, the data showed.
Only around 10% of companies expect supply bottlenecks to end by mid-2022 and 22% say they do not expect the situation to improve until 2023, DIHK said.
""We will probably not reach the pre-crisis level of our economic output until the middle of the year,"" DIHK Managing Director Martin Wansleben said, adding expected cost increases due to energy transformation may discourage some investors.
""Germany as a business location has the world's highest energy prices at the moment. The tax burden for companies is also well above the average for all OECD countries,"" Wansleben said.

Just under a third of companies intend to invest more in 2022, while just under a fifth intend to invest less, DIHK said.
""The economy is holding its breath. It is true there is still a cautiously optimistic sentiment among companies. However, there are major uncertainties and many do not know what the future holds,"" the director said.

411,"<span>Feb 11, 2022 02:27AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. economy expanded at the fastest pace since World War II last year after suffering a milder hit than expected in December.
The 7.5% expansion was the largest since 1941 and made Britain the fastest-growing advanced economy in 2021. Gross domestic product fell 0.2% in December as the spread of the omicron variant kept consumers at home. 
The figures will be welcomed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is grappling with a brutal cost of living crisis and facing calls to resign over alleged rule breaking parties when the country was in lockdown. They will also keep the Bank of England focused on efforts to curb surging inflation, with more interest-rate increases likely in coming months. 
After suffering a deeper pandemic recession than its major peers, contracting 9.4% in 2020, the U.K. has enjoyed a stronger recovery, aided by billions of pounds of government aid to support jobs and firms through the crisis. The economy is forecast to outperform other Group of Seven nations once again this year. 
Thanks to “our package of support and making the right calls at the right time, the economy has been remarkably resilient,” said Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak.
However, Britain has yet to return to its pre-pandemic levels of output on a quarterly basis, a milestone already surpassed by the U.S. and France. 
The fall in GDP in December was entirely due to a 0.5% contraction in the services sector, where hospitality venues were hit by mass cancellations in the run-up to Christmas, and retailers saw a collapse in footfall, after the government imposed curbs to contain the spread of omicron. 
Businesses across the economy were also hampered by widespread absences linked to the virus and continued supply-chain disruptions. On the plus side, health-care output rose, driven by the rollout of vaccine booster shots.  
The loss of output in December limited growth in the fourth quarter to just 1%, leaving GDP 0.4% below its level at the end of 2019. With omicron restrictions extending into the new year, January is also expected to be weak.
BOE forecasts published Feb. 3 show the economy stagnating in the first quarter, but rebounding strongly in the following three months to return to its pre-Covid size. The bank has hiked rates at it two previous meetings, taking the benchmark to 0.5%, and markets are pricing in a rapid series of further moves this year.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's economy returned to growth in the fourth quarter last year with the central bank expecting the recovery to continue this year despite risks of further disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Gross domestic product rose 3.6% in the October-December period, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) said on Friday, faster than the 3.3% rise forecast in a Reuters poll and up from a 4.5% decline in the previous quarter.
Malaysia's full-year economic performance expanded 3.1% in 2021, rebounding from the 5.6% drop in 2020, the country's worst annual performance since the 1998 Asian Financial Crisis.
BNM said Malaysia's economic recovery was expected to continue in line with improved global and domestic demand.
Risks remain to the downside, however, mainly due to concerns over ""severe and vaccine-resistant COVID-19 variants"" that could trigger new containment curbs ""globally and domestically,"" BNM Governor Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus told a news conference.
Malaysia has seen a resurgence in COVID-19 cases in recent weeks, mostly from the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
However, the government has vowed not to reimpose lockdowns amid a ramped-up COVID-19 inoculation programme.
Nearly 80% of the country's 32 million population has received at least two doses of COVID-19 vaccine, while more than a third has received a booster.
Capital Economics analyst Alex Holmes said in a note the impact of new infections should be relatively mild and brief given high vaccination rates.
The economic recovery will also likely be boosted by the reopening of international borders, with Malaysia planning to end mandatory quarantine for inbound travellers on March 1, he said. 
Nor Shamsiah said headline inflation is expected to remain moderate this year and denied speculation Malaysia was experiencing signs of hyperinflation or stagflation.
She said the current monetary policy stance was considered appropriate and accommodative and that BNM was mindful of any premature withdrawal of policy support. 
Last month, the central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at a record low of 1.75% to support continued recovery.
Malaysia is projecting 2022 economic growth of between 5.5%-6.5%.
Any revisions to the official outlook will be announced on March 30, along with the central bank's decision on digital banking licenses, Nor Shamsiah said.

BNM has received 29 bids for the licenses so far, with only five expected to be issued.

The January surplus compared to a January 2021 deficit of $163 billion, a record for the month as direct payments to individuals from COVID-19 aid legislation enacted in December 2020 were distributed.
The surplus last month was the first since the $83 billion reported in September 2019 and the largest since the $160 billion in April 2019. April and September are traditionally months with high tax collections.
The January receipts grew by 21% to $465 billion, boosted by a 21% jump in individual withheld income and payroll taxes that reflected higher employment and earnings due to the economic recovery.
January outlays fell 37% to $346 billion, partly as they did not include $142 billion in individual stimulus payments sent in January 2021.

The surplus for the month also was helped by the recognition of $70 billion in proceeds from a wireless spectrum auction, a U.S. Treasury official said.
For the first four months of the 2022 fiscal year that started Oct. 1, the Treasury reported a deficit of $259 billion, a 65% decline from the year-earlier deficit of $736 billion. Year-to-date receipts grew 28% to $1.52 trillion, while outlays for the period fell 8% to $1.78 trillion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose solidly in January, leading to the biggest annual increase in inflation in 40 years, fueling financial markets speculation for a 50 basis points interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve next month.
The broad increase in prices reported by the Labor Department on Thursday was led by soaring costs for rents, electricity and food, and could heap more political pressure on President Joe Biden, whose popularity has been declining amid anxiety over the rising cost of living. 
High inflation has overshadowed a strong economy, which grew at its fastest pace in 37 years in 2021 and a labor market that is rapidly churning out jobs.
""While this report, on its own, might not trigger a 50 basis points inaugural rate hike from the Fed, the pressure will continue to mount if inflation doesn't begin to rollover this spring as policymakers anticipate,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
The consumer price index gained 0.6% last month after a similar increase in December. The food index rose 0.9%, with the cost of food consumed at home increasing 1.0%. There strong increases in the prices of cereals and bakery products, dairy, fruits and vegetables. Meat prices rose moderately. 
Electricity prices jumped 4.2%, offsetting a 0.8% decline in the cost of gasoline and a 0.5% drop in natural gas.
In the 12 months through January, the CPI jumped 7.5%, the biggest year-on-year increase since February 1982. 
That followed a 7.0% advance in December and marked the fourth straight month of annual increases in excess of 6%. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI rising 0.5% on month and accelerating 7.3% on a year-on-year basis.
Effective with the January report, the CPI was re-weighted based on consumer expenditure data from 2019-2020.
The economy is grappling with high inflation, caused by a shift in spending to goods from services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Trillions of dollars in pandemic relief fired up spending, which ran against capacity constraints as the coronavirus sidelined workers needed to produce and move goods to consumers.
U.S. stocks opened lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.

EYES ON THE FED
The Fed is expected to start raising rates in March to rein in inflation, which has overshot the U.S. central bank's 2% target. Financial markets are predicting nearly even odds of a 50 basis points increase, according to CME's FedWatch tool.
Market predictions are partly driven by the fact that price pressures are broadening, with several measures of wage inflation increasing strongly in recent months. 
Economists, however, believe it is unlikely that the Fed would move so aggressively. They expect the central bank to raise rates by 25 basis points at least seven times this year.
""Rather, the Fed would be more likely to guide to an accelerated pace of hikes at consecutive meetings to crack down on inflation,"" said Scott Ruesterholz, a portfolio manager at Insight Investment in New York.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI increased 0.6% last month, matching December's rise. It was the seventh time in the last 10 months that the so-called core CPI has increased at least 0.5%. Underlying inflation last month was driven by a 0.5% increase in rents.
It was also boosted by strong gains in the prices for household furnishings and operations as well as used cars and trucks. Healthcare costs rose 0.7%, lifted by hospital services and prescription medication.
In the 12 months through January, the so-called core CPI jumped 6.0%. That was the largest year-on-year gain since August 1982 and followed a 5.5% advance in December.
Monthly inflation could slow in the coming months amid an easing in supply bottlenecks as coronavirus infections driven by the Omicron variant subside.
Government data this week showed goods imports increased to a record high in December as ships offloaded their cargo after months of delays because of labor shortages at ports. Wholesale motor vehicle inventories increased by the most in 10 years in December.
Still, inflation will remain high for a while, in part reflecting the delayed impact of rising wages. Employers are boosting compensation as they compete for scarce workers. There were 10.9 million job openings at the end of December.
""The factors that have driven inflation higher in 2021 are only expected to dissipate gradually and are likely to keep pushing inflation higher through the first half of 2022,"" said Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI), chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut. 
""We expect that there will be a shift from goods inflation, particularly motor vehicle and commodities prices to more persistent services inflation, such as wages and heavily weighted rents.""

A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 223,000 for the week ended Feb. 5. Economists had forecast 230,000 applications for the latest week. Claims increased from the beginning of January through the middle of the month as Omicron raged across the country. 
They have dropped from a record high of 6.149 million in early April of 2020.

COMMENTS:
TOM PORCELLI, CHIEF US ECONOMIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK
“Interestingly enough, and just something to note, they just changed the weighting, the CPI did, of goods.  Goods now have more of a weighting, which again makes sense, because it’s based on what spending happened last year. So the weight of goods prices are now very elevated relative to what we saw prior. So if I’m right that you’re going to have this transition from goods to services spending, and there’s a bigger weight now for goods, what’s going to happen to goods prices? It probably falls even more than what I originally thought. That’s a long way of saying I think you get some acceleration in the immediate term, but I do think by the end of the year we’ll be in a very different place from an inflation perspective, a better place. So much of it is contingent on that idea, you need this transition to take place between goods and services.”
“We all expected an acceleration here…is 7.5% to 7.3% the difference between a 25 and a 50 (basis point hike)? No. I sincerely hope that the Fed’s reaction function is not that sensitive to this kind of miss. Because the reality is we’ve had firm inflation now for months. This is the number that’s going to push them over the edge? I don’t think that they’re supposed to go 50 basis points. I think they are supposed to go 25 basis points and I think they are supposed to have a lot of patience between now and the balance of the year.”
JAMIE COX, MANAGING PARTNER, HARRIS FINANCIAL GROUP, RICHMOND, VIRGINIA
  “All eyes are on the Fed in March. Markets are starting to price in a 50 basis point hike as opposed to a gradual increase in the Fed funds rate starting in March.”
“Markets are definitely taking this data under consideration as a likelihood to increase that probability. At this point, everyone knew that the inflation data was going to be hot. That's not a surprise. But the clues that everybody's looking for is whether or not the data is hot enough to induce the Fed to raise rates quicker.”
“I think that they're (Fed) more likely to work off the balance sheet at a higher rate, sort of spin down. I don't think they're going to go fast on the Fed funds rate. They would preferentially choose to hike every meeting as opposed to doing larger fed fund rate increases.”
“Markets are going to continue to transition from growth to value and that rotation is going to be in play in earnest here for a while. The rotation that started in fits and starts last year is now going to be more of a permanent condition.”
JAI MALHI, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, JPMORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT
“US inflation has consistently beaten expectations and today’s inflation release saw more of the same. This provides a significant challenge for the Fed as it aims to keep price increases under control while at the same time sustaining the economic expansion.
“High energy prices and supply issues are stoking inflation but these issues should eventually fade. Of greater concern is that wage pressures are building and the central bank will not want to risk a wage price spiral. Looking ahead though, real consumer spending on discretionary goods and services is likely to cool naturally, as higher energy costs begin to bite. 
“The bond market is currently suggesting that there is a good chance the Fed will hike rates more than 5 times by the end of the year. While today’s release will be uncomfortable reading for the Fed, the squeeze on real incomes suggests they can perhaps afford to be a little more patient than the market thinks.”
BRIAN BATTLE, DIRECTOR OF TRADING, PERFORMANCE TRUST CAPITAL PARTNERS, CHICAGO
    “These are the biggest numbers in decades. However economic statistics have no value right now because of the statistical noise due to the lockdowns ... The statistics are full off exceptions.”
    “The numbers came in about as expected. So it'll affect the market two ways. One, the Federal Reserve is going to raise rates. These numbers support their case for quantitative easing and to raise rates, so those two things are still on the table.""
    ""So what matters to us out here in the field is how much are they going to raise rates? At what speed we can't tell right now, but we know that their intentions will not be thwarted by these numbers.”
KATHY LIEN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, BK ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK
“Ultimately, this is a very dollar-positive number. It sent the dollar up pretty much across the board, particularly against the Japanese yen. Fifty basis points is going to be back on the table for March. I still think they’re going to go with 25, but you can see from the fed fund futures that 50 bps odds have jumped to about 45%. 
“The market is shifting its positioning, it’s something that investors can’t ignore.  We had a very quiet week for the most part, with the euro-dollar and dollar-yen, this is the number we've been waiting for. The confirmation that we've got hot inflation means that it's all-go on monetary tightening.”
BRIAN JACOBSEN, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, ALLSPRING GLOBAL INVESTMENTS, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN
“With good jobless claims and hotter than expected inflation, the hawks are having a field day at the Fed. I’m not expecting monthly inflation relief until March. The Fed will likely accelerate its balance sheet runoff to May instead of risking a 50 bps hike. They have a couple levers to pull to remove accommodation. The optics around a faster or sooner balance sheet runoff are probably better than a bigger than typical hike.”
PAUL NOLTE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, KINGSVIEW INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, CHICAGO
    ""Where we're seeing it really play out is in the bond market. So we're seeing the spread between the 2/10s come in a little bit more. We're getting down to the 50 level, which for us is kind of the trigger point for a countdown to a recession. It is another data point that points to the fact the Fed will be in the market raising rates, and at some point during that rate hiking cycle you'll likely see something break in the economy. That's what we've seen historically from the Fed.""

“The market is starting to price in a much more aggressive path of rate hikes and this really starts to increase the odds of perhaps a 50-basis points rate hike at one of the meetings, but broadly speaking we’re pretty much fully priced in for a hike per meeting between now and July.”
JOE SALUZZI, CO-MANAGER, TRADING, THEMIS TRADING, NEW JERSEY
“That's more than expected. So now the market is going to be worrying - are we getting a 50 basis point hike instead of a 25? And the whole story of how many we're going to get, how often it's going to be and what's the pace of rate hikes.”
“The reason we don't know is if it's supply or demand driven still. Part of it is supply driven. And if that kind of works itself out, then it's more of a temporary thing and it will come down.”
“The hawkishness is built into the market at this point. It's in there. So that's why I'm kind of surprised that they sold off as much as they did. I wouldn't be surprised if we see a bounce back rally come mid-day today in the stock market.”
ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK
""The data obviously came in a bit hotter-than-expected but people were expecting a hot number to begin with, so it was pretty well priced into the market because everyone has been talking about inflation.""
""So at this one point in time, it doesn't sway the market in terms of what the Fed is going to do in March.""
""We also have to look at the way the market was set up before the data, three in the last four days were positive and you are coming from a place where everyone put inflation worries in the back burner for a bit and focused more on better corporate earnings.""
""Markets have been very constructive leading up to this news, especially with the Nasdaq retracing about half its losses from January lows, so we are certainly at a place where the reaction function has a downside to it.""
PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“CPI came in a bit on the high side, and it doesn’t suggest inflation is peaking anytime soon. It might mean the Fed could get more aggressive. The jury is still out whether we’ll have a 25-basis-point or 50-basis-point rate hike in March.” 
“Obviously, this means (10-year Treasury yields) will test the 2% pretty quickly, and the dollar is strengthening.”

“I would say inflation will peak in the beginning of the fourth quarter. There are still bottlenecks out there. The real test is wages. Last week’s employment data suggests salaries are taking off. That’s structural.” 
“We’ll see in February employment data to see if there’s another increase in wages. That could the key point as to whether the Fed gets more aggressive.”

Initial unemployment claims decreased by 16,000 to 223,000 in the week ended Feb. 5, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate called for 230,000 applications in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
Continuing claims for state benefits were unchanged at 1.62 million in the week ended Jan. 29.
Claims have been falling for the past few weeks as the labor market gets back on track from the spread of the omicron variant, which led to a surge in unemployment applications over the new year. More broadly, claims are trending toward pre-pandemic levels as companies struggle to retain and attract talent amid ongoing labor shortages, keeping layoffs at a record low.
On an unadjusted basis, initial claims decreased to 228,909 last week. 
Kentucky, Tennessee and Illinois were states registering the biggest decreases in unadjusted claims. Michigan had the largest increase.

There had never been such a high order backlog since Ifo started asking companies about it in 1969, Timo Wollmershaeuser, head of Ifo economic forecasts, said in a statement. 
Incoming orders in the past few months often could not be processed due to shortages in preliminary and raw products, he said.

Consumer spending is likely to remain sluggish in the first quarter, with political uncertainty adding to concerns, the university said, following signs of discord growing https://reut.rs/3BcTLjF in the coalition government https://reut.rs/3HILh6b.

The quarter's growth was driven by a 10.8% rise in oil activities and a 5% increase in non-oil activities, the General Authority for Statistics said. Government services increased by 2.4%.
""The increase in oil production is being reflected in the 4Q GDP data, and is supporting real oil sector growth. We see this trend continuing in 2022 as oil output rises further,"" said Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.
Quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted real GDP grew by 1.6% in the fourth quarter, the authority said.
Saudi Arabia notched 7% growth in the third quarter, its fastest expansion in about a decade.
GDP growth for the full year was a marked turn from the 4.1% contraction in 2020, when oil crashed and economies across the world were hammered by the pandemic's impact.

The estimated 3.3% expansion came above the government's forecast of 2.9% growth for 2021. Riyadh expects the Saudi economy to grow 7.4% next year.

424,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 10:10PM ET</span>",,,,,,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer inflation likely slowed in January from the previous month, a Reuters poll showed, reinforcing expectations the country's central bank will lag well behind other economies in raising interest rates.
Separate data is also expected to show Japan likely ran the biggest trade deficit in eight years in January as persistent rises in fuel and raw material costs swelled imports, according to economists polled by Reuters.
The nationwide core consumer price index (CPI) likely rose 0.3% in January from a year earlier, slowing from a 0.5% gain in December, the poll of 16 economists showed on Friday.
The slowdown is largely due to one-off factors such as the base effect from a suspension of the government's travel discount campaign in late 2020.
When stripping away such temporary factors, consumer inflation is likely to be perking up, analysts say.
""Imported goods prices have been rising, and the effect is spreading to previously soft domestic prices,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
And yet, many analysts expect consumer inflation to remain distant from the Bank of Japan's 2% target for the time being, forcing the central bank to maintain ultra-loose policy.
Separate data will likely show Japan suffered a trade deficit of 1,607 billion yen ($13.91 billion) in January, the biggest shortfall since January 2014.
Imports likely jumped 37.1% in January on rising raw material and fuel costs, outpacing a 16.5% gain in exports, the poll showed.
Core machinery orders, also due next week, likely fell 1.8% month-on-month in December to mark the first decline in four months, the poll showed.

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said a net balance of +74% of its members reported a rise in house prices in January, up from +70% in December and its highest since July. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of +68%.
The report echoed other surveys that show Britain's housing market retained much of its momentum going into 2022, despite the phasing out of temporary tax breaks on property purchases in the second half of 2021.
But with household budgets being squeezed by high inflation and imminent tax rises, RICS cast doubt on whether the housing market can keep up its recent strength.
""There is an inevitable question mark over the impact of rising interest rates allied to the jump in the cost of living on homebuyer sentiment,"" RICS chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said, referring to the Bank of England's decision last week to raise borrowing costs for the second time in two months.

Earlier this week mortgage provider Halifax warned that house price growth - running at 10% year-on-year according to the latest official data - was likely to slow considerably, despite a limited number of houses coming to the market.
Rubinsohn said it was ""a little worrisome"" that RICS' gauges of house prices and rents for the next 12 months had both approached series highs, suggesting a peak was near.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. wholesale inventories rose slightly more than initially estimated in December as motor vehicle stocks increased by the most in 10 years, offering hope that supply chain constraints could be easing.
The strong inventory build reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday, including an upward revision to November's data, also suggested fourth quarter economic growth could be revised higher when its Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) publishes its second gross domestic product estimate later this month. The report followed news on Tuesday that the trade deficit widened less-than-expected in December.
""These upward revisions to the wholesale inventory data make what already had been a strong increase in wholesale inventories estimated by the BEA for the fourth quarter look even firmer,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Wholesale inventories increased 2.2% in December, instead of 2.1% as estimated last month. Data for November was revised up to show at wholesalers advancing 1.7% instead of the previously reported 1.4%. Economists polled by Reuters had expected inventories would be unrevised.
Wholesale inventories jumped 18.5% in December from the year-earlier period. Inventories are a key part of gross domestic product. Goods imports hit a record high in December.
Strained global supply chains had been making it harder for businesses to replenish depleted inventories. Motor vehicle stocks remain very low because of a global shortage of semiconductors, which is constraining motor vehicle production.
In December, wholesale motor vehicle inventories accelerated 4.6%, the largest gain since December 2011, after rising 3.4% in November. Wholesale inventories, excluding autos, increased 2.0% in December. This component goes into the calculation of GDP.
Inventory investment surged at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of $173.5 billion in the fourth quarter, the second-largest quarterly increase on record. 
Inventories contributed 4.90 percentage points to the fourth quarter's 6.9% annualized growth pace. With the latest inventory data in hand, JPMorgan's Silver estimates that inventory investment increased at a $182 billion rate last quarter, which would add 5.1% percentage points to GDP growth. 
Other economists agree and expect GDP growth could be raised to as high as a 7.2% pace.
Restocking, after three straight quarters during which inventories were drawn down, is supporting manufacturing. Most economists see further scope for inventories to rise, noting that inflation-adjusted inventories remain below their pre-pandemic level. Sales-to-inventory ratios are also low. 
The strong inventory build last quarter, however, suggest restocking will probably have a limited impact on GDP growth in the first quarter. 

""Inventories would need to increase more than that seen in the fourth quarter to add to first-quarter GDP growth,"" said Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""That seems unlikely because of the Omicron variant and its impact on supply chains.""
Sales at wholesalers gained 0.2% in December after rising 1.7% in November. At December's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.25 months to clear shelves, the most since February 2021, and up from 1.22 months in November.

ROME, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Italian industrial output was weaker than expected in December, falling 1.0% from the month before after a large, upwardly revised rise of 2.1% in November, data showed on Wednesday.
A Reuters survey of 19 analysts had pointed to a 0.7% monthly decline in December.
November's data was revised up from an originally reported 1.9% increase.
On a work-day adjusted year-on-year basis, industrial output was up 4.4% in December, ISTAT said, slowing from a 6.6% annual increase in November. 
In the three months to December, output was up 0.5% compared with the previous quarter, ISTAT said, slowing from a gain of 1.1% in the third quarter.
Over the whole of 2021 industrial output was up 11.8% from the year before, recovering all of the 11.4% drop in 2020 when the economy was crippled by coronavirus lockdowns.
December saw month-on-month declines in production of consumer goods, investment goods and intermediate goods, ISTAT said, while output of energy products increased marginally.
The Italian economy grew by a preliminary 6.5% in 2021, data showed last week, following a record contraction of 8.9% in 2020.
For this year, Mario Draghi's government officially forecasts a gross domestic product rise of 4.7%, but high energy prices and a recent surge in coronavirus cases and deaths have clouded the outlook.
Business and consumer confidence declined in January and most analysts and think tanks now view the government's full-year growth forecast as optimistic.

""The shortage of supplies was a burden. Meanwhile, the export balance sheet looks surprisingly good,"" Thomas Gitzel, chief economist at VP Bank, said.
""The order books are full, so there is no shortage of commissions,"" the economist said, adding export growth should pick up sharply after the easing of supply problems.
At the same time, whether this happens in 2022 will also depend on how things develop in eastern Ukraine because Germany's export machinery can only function to a limited extent without oil, gas and metals from Russia, Gitzel said.
Seasonally adjusted exports rose 0.9% on the month to 117.0 billion euros ($133.58 billion), compared with a decline of 0.2% predicted by economists.
Imports jumped 4.7% to 110.0 billion euros, compared with an average forecast for a 1.5% decrease.
""The increase is the icing on the cake of a good export quarter. Full order books at industrial companies are also a good basis for further export growth,"" Alexander Krueger at Hauck Aufhaeuser Lampe Privatbank said.

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment released on Wednesday slipped 1.3% in February from January, when it dropped 2.0%.
The index was down 7.6% from February last year at 100.8, meaning optimists only just outnumbered pessimists.
""The most likely explanations for these elevated pressures on finances relate to: Omicron-related disruptions to activity and earnings at the start of the year; the rising cost of living; and the prospect of rising interest rates,"" said Westpac chief economist Bill Evans.
The cost of petrol alone has climbed 15% over the past two months, while supply bottlenecks have pushed up goods prices and the cost of building new homes. Rents have also been on the rise, leading to a sharp fall in sentiment among tenants.
The impact was clear in the survey's measure of family finances compared with a year ago which dived 9.3%, while the outlook for finances over the next 12 months fell 1.5%.
The survey's measure of whether it was a good time to buy a major household item eased 0.3%, while the 'time to buy a dwelling' index fell 2.4%.

That contrasted with a slight improvement in the economic outlook for the next 12 months which added 2.5% after a steep drop in January, while the outlook for the next five years rose 1.5%.
Media speculation about a rise in interest rates from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) saw the proportion of respondents expecting an increase in mortgage rates over the next 12 months lift to 66% in February, from 55% the month before.

(Reuters) - U.S. consumer debt loads grew in 2021 by the largest amount in 14 years as people ramped up borrowing to afford homes, cars and other goods that are becoming more expensive, according to a report released on Tuesday by the New York Federal Reserve.
The higher borrowing was fueled in part by rising prices as consumers cope with the strongest inflation seen in nearly four decades. And households, supported by increased savings and higher incomes, seem to be handling the larger debt loads well so far, researchers said.
""The aggregate balances of newly opened mortgage and auto loans sharply increased in 2021, corresponding to increases in home and car prices,"" Wilbert Van Der Klaauw, senior vice president at the New York Fed, said in a statement. 
Total household debt grew by $1 trillion last year, marking the largest increase in overall debt since 2007, according to the New York Fed's quarterly report on household debt and credit. The total debt balance is now $1.4 trillion higher than it was at the end of 2019. 
Over $4.5 trillion in mortgages were originated in 2021, reaching a historic high for the database, which goes back to 1999. Mortgage balances increased by $258 billion in the fourth quarter to $10.93 trillion at the end of December. 
Auto loan originations returned to pre-pandemic trends but loan amounts increased in response to rising car prices, New York Fed researchers said. ""As car prices have soared, buyers have borrowed more to finance the additional cost,"" researchers wrote in a separate blog post published on Tuesday.
Some borrowers anticipating higher interest rates may also be taking advantage of lower borrowing costs, researchers said, noting an increase in mortgage refinancing. 
Fed officials are expected to start raising interest rates in March and to begin shrinking their balance sheet holdings later this year. Both actions could increase borrowing costs as the Fed works to tame inflation and remove the support offered during the pandemic. 
Graphic: Number of accounts by loan type - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/HOUSEHOLD-DEBT/lbpgnwzmrvq/chart_eikon.jpg 
MORE CAPACITY TO ADD DEBT
In a sign that consumers are returning to their pre-pandemic spending habits, credit card balances also increased by $52 billion in the fourth quarter. That marked the largest quarterly increase observed in the history of the data, but credit card balances are still $71 billion lower than they were at the end of 2019. 
Credit card use typically rises in the fourth quarter as people make holiday purchases, but the increase could also reflect higher prices for goods and services, researchers said. 
Households in aggregate have so far been able to absorb the higher debt loads and delinquencies remain low, thanks in part to savings accumulated earlier in the pandemic and forbearance programs, researchers said. 
""The economy is recovering, incomes are up and households have the capacity to add debt,"" said Tim Duy, a University of Oregon professor and the chief economist of SGH Macro Advisers. 
The share of disposable income that households spend on rent, loan payments, taxes and other bills is low by historical standards, Duy said. 

Still, some borrowers that haven't fared well during the pandemic could have a harder time keeping up with their debt payments later, New York Fed researchers said. 
It will be important to watch how some borrowers fare after they need to resume student loan debt payments in a few months, they said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit surged to a record high in 2021 as imports increased sharply amid the restocking of shelves by businesses to meet robust domestic demand.
The sharp widening in the trade gap reported by the Commerce Department on Tuesday mostly reflected a shift in spending toward goods from services during the COVID-19 pandemic. With businesses eager to rebuild depleted inventories against the backdrop of stretched global supply chains, the deficit is unlikely to shrink much this year, cutting into economic growth.
""The need to replenish inventory in the United States will keep imports strong even as domestic demand transitions back to services,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Eventually as domestic demand begins to slow and the global recovery continues, we expect trade to become more of a neutral force on growth next year.""
The trade deficit increased 27.0% last year to an all-time high of $859.1 billion. It was at $676.7 billion in 2020.
The trade gap represented 3.7% of gross domestic product, up from 3.2% in 2020. The deficit subtracted 1.39 percentage points from GDP growth last year. 
The economy grew 5.7% in 2021, the strongest since 1984, after the government provided nearly $6 trillion in pandemic relief, which fueled consumer spending on goods. 
The goods deficit shot up to a record $1.1 trillion last year from $922 billion in 2020. Imports of goods hit an all-time high of $2.9 trillion. 
They were driven by imports of industrial supplies and materials, which increased to their highest level since 2014.
Food imports were the highest on record as were those of capital, consumer and other goods. There were record imports from 70 countries in 2021, led by Mexico, Canada and Germany.
Robust import growth overshadowed a sharp rebound in exports. Goods exports surged 23.3% to a record $1.8 trillion. Exports of industrial supplies and materials, foods, consumer goods, other goods and petroleum were the highest on record.
EXPORTS REBOUND
The United States logged record exports to 57 countries last year, led by Mexico, where they increased to $276.5 billion. Shipments to China rose 21.4% to $151.1 billion. But with imports from China increasing 16.5% to $506.4 billion, the politically sensitive trade deficit with Beijing increased to $355.3 billion last year from $310.3 billion in 2020.
During the administration of former president Donald Trump, China pledged to buy more goods from the United States. However, it missed its targets under the ""Phase 1"" trade deal signed in January 2020 to halt escalation of a tariff war on Chinese goods launched by Trump in 2018. The purchases commitments expired at the end of 2021.
""The goods imported from China would create a lot of jobs if the country could produce it here, but with American wages soaring out of sight, it is unlikely that U.S. manufacturers will restart their factories here especially for consumer goods where margins are tight,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.
In a final boost to the trade gap for the year, the shortfall in December increased 1.8% from the prior month to $80.7 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an $83.0 billion deficit in December. 
The smaller-than-expected widening in the deficit reflected a $1.4 billion increase in exports of services, which were boosted by travel and transportation. It suggested that the government could raise its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate, when it publishes its first revision later this month.
Trade made no contribution to last quarter's 6.9% annualized GDP growth rate. It had subtracted from growth for five straight quarters.
The goods trade deficit rose 3.2% to $101.4 billion in December, marking a record high. December imports of goods surged 2.0% to an all-time high of $259.7 billion. There were record highs set for imports of capital and consumer goods.
Some of the rise in imports likely reflected goods being offloaded after being delayed for months aboard ships at U.S. ports because of worker shortages. Port backlogs remain high, which suggests goods imports could set another record high in January. Prior to the pandemic, imports tended to peak ahead of the holiday shopping season, tapering off by the first quarter.
""But growth of imports will slow over the rest of 2022,"" said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica (NYSE:CMA) Bank. 
""Businesses are making progress rebuilding inventories, and real consumer spending on durable goods is forecast to fall in 2022. That will mean less demand for imported consumer products as the year goes on.""

Goods exports rose 1.3% to $158.3 billion in December. In addition to the strong growth in services exports, shipments of consumer goods were the highest on record.
""The world economy is coming around, as Omicron starts to burn itself out and restrictions are eased,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""That is the good news. The bad news is that the U.S. continues to ship its recovery out to the rest of the world.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada posted a surprise trade deficit in December, as imports hit a new record high and exports fell from November, official data showed on Tuesday, but economists expect an export rebound in January on surging energy prices.
Canada's trade deficit was C$137 million ($108 million) in December, well below analyst forecasts of a surplus of C$2.50 billion. November's surplus was also revised down to C$2.47 billion from C$3.13 billion, still good for a 13-year record.
Imports rose 3.7% to hit an all-time record for the third consecutive month, driven by cellphones and other electronics, while exports fell 0.9%, mostly on lower energy prices.
""It's a pretty small deficit, I would look at it as more or less balanced. But it was a bit of a split month in December,"" said Stuart Bergman, deputy chief economist at Export Development Canada.
Bergman noted strong imports of motor vehicles and parts, which bodes well for cross border trade, along with strong exports of consumer goods. Energy weighed on exports as crude prices fell sharply, but oil prices have since rebounded.
""We expect exports should probably come back in January on stronger energy prices,"" said Bergman.
Still, the drop in exports in December will likely act as a drag on fourth quarter GDP, analysts said.
For full-year 2021, Canada's annual merchandise exports rose 22%, Statscan said, with the value hitting a record C$637 billion. With the effect of higher prices stripped out, 2021 exports were 5.4% down from 2019.
""The further upswing in energy prices bodes well for the trade balance in the early part of 2022,"" said Shelly Kaushik, economist at BMO Capital Markets, noting Canada's first annual surplus since 2014.

The National Federation of Independent Business said its Small Business Optimism Index dropped 1.8 points to 97.1 last month, the lowest reading since February 2021. 
Scarce workers and rising labor costs remain the main areas of worry for businesses.
Snarled supply chains as the global economy rebounds from the COVID-19 pandemic, fueled by massive stimulus from governments, have unleashed inflation. The pandemic, now in its third year, has also disrupted labor supply, making it difficult for goods to move from factories to consumers.
There were a near record 10.9 million job openings at the end of December. 
The NFIB survey showed half of the 1,504 small businesses who participated in the poll reporting raising compensation. That was the highest reading in 48 years and was up 2 points from December. That corroborates to a surge in measures of wage growth tracked by the government. 
About 27% of small businesses said they planned to increase compensation in the next three months, down 5 points from December, but still historically high.
Eleven percent said labor costs were their top business problem, down 2 points from December's 48-year record high reading. About 23% complained about labor quality.

Faced with rising labor costs, the share of small businesses raising average selling prices jumped 4 points to 61%, the highest reading since the fourth quarter of 1974. Price hikes were most frequent in wholesale, manufacturing, retail and construction industries. 
The Federal Reserve is expected to start raising interest rates next month by at least 25 basis points to tame high inflation. Economists anticipate as many as seven rate hikes this year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan ran a current account deficit in December for the first time in one-and-half years due to the surging cost of fuel imports, data showed on Tuesday, in a sign of the rising toll global commodity inflation is inflicting on the economy.
The data underscores the shift in Japan's economic structure from a country that gained wealth from exports of goods to one that is vulnerable to swings in raw material costs due to its increasing reliance on energy and food imports.
The world's third-largest economy ran a current account deficit of 370.8 billion yen ($3.2 billion) in December, government data showed, confounding market forecasts for a 73.5 billion yen surplus. It was the first deficit since June 2020.
Rising fuel costs drove up the value of imports by 44.8% in December from a year earlier, outpacing a 18.7% rise in exports and pushing the trade balance into a 318.7-billion-yen deficit.
Japan's rising energy bill could heighten public complaints over a weak yen, which further inflates the cost of imports.
""The demerits of a weak yen is that it pushes up the import cost of energy and food, thereby increasing households' burden as well as material costs of corporates,"" Japan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda recently told Reuters.
For the whole of 2021, Japan ran a current account surplus of 15.4 trillion yen, down 2.8% from the previous year due largely to rising energy costs, the data showed.

The decline in the trade surplus was offset somewhat by a steady rise in returns from overseas investment, which drove up Japan's income surplus by 1.2 trillion yen to 20.4 trillion yen.
""Japan used to earn surplus from goods exports. That structure has changed to one where Japan profits from investment flows,"" SMBC Nikko Securities wrote in a research note.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A measure of Australian business conditions took a turn for the worse in January as a surge in coronavirus cases hit consumer spending, though firms were optimistic the hit would be short-lived.
Tuesday's survey from National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) (NAB) showed its index of business conditions dropped 5 points to +3 in January, as sales halved to +7 and profitability slid 8 points to +2. Its measure of employment dipped 3 points to -1.
The index of confidence bounced to +3, having dived 24 points in December to -12.
""Confidence fell sharply in December as the Omicron variant began to spread, but rebounded in January, reflecting that the outbreak looks to have peaked quickly and lockdowns have been avoided,"" said NAB chief economist Alan Oster.
""Conditions have remained in positive territory and are nowhere near as bad as we saw during lockdowns imposed in 2020 and 2021.""
Inflation remained a problem as purchase costs rose at a record quarterly pace of 3.4% amid high commodity prices and supply bottlenecks. Labour costs held at a 1.9% pace, though retail price growth eased a touch to 1.3%.
""The economy is facing a period of elevated inflation while supply chain issues remain unresolved,"" added Oster.
A separate survey of consumers from ANZ out on Tuesday showed a drop of 1.9% last week, with media speculation about the risk of future rate rises apparently having an impact on heavily indebted households.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) last week conceded there were scenarios where interest rates could rise later this year should the economy keep surprising with its strength.

Also out Tuesday was CBA's latest measure of household spending intentions which showed a sharp 10% drop in January as a surge in coronavirus cases kept people at home.
Spending on bank cards, however, has stabilised in the last couple of weeks as cases decline and the overall economy looks to have weathered the outbreak well.

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers slowed the pace of their spending last month as the Omicron COVID-19 wave hit fuel sales and kept people away from bars and restaurants, according to a survey which also pointed to the impact of rising inflation.
Consumer spending was 7.4% higher than in January 2020 - before the pandemic - the weakest increase since April last year, payments provider Barclaycard said.
It said nine in 10 people it surveyed felt their household finances and discretionary spending were being impacted by the recent jump in prices.
Britain's inflation rate hit a 30-year high of 5.4% in December and looks set to top 7% in April, according to the Bank of England which last week raised interest rates for the second time in two months and said further increases were likely.
Jose Carvalho, head of consumer products at Barclaycard, said there were some signs of relief for the hospitality industry with people saying they planned to spend more on eating and drinking out in the months ahead.
""The lifting of Plan B restrictions should also provide a welcome boost to many sectors, as workers travel back into the office and socialise over post-work drinks, while businesses will likely start to see the benefits of increased inbound tourism on retail sales too,"" he said.
Advice to work from home, along with rules on mask-wearing and vaccine passes, were lifted in England on Jan. 26, six weeks after they were introduced.
A separate survey published on Tuesday suggested a brighter picture for retailers - a narrower measure of consumer spending.
Sales increased by 11.9% in January compared with the same month last year, the biggest increase since May last year, the British Retail Consortium said.
Many non-essential retailers were closed in January 2021 - although this year's figure was still 7.5% higher than in January 2020 - and some of the increase in the sales figures was due to the jump in inflation, BRC said.
Furniture sales were particularly strong last month as transport delays eased.

Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG which co-produces the BRC's figures, said retailers were hoping consumer confidence remains robust to help offset the rising cost challenges.
""We could see a challenging few months ahead if wider macroeconomic conditions start to squeeze household incomes to the point that they start cutting back on retail spending,"" Martin said.

Spending gained 0.1% from November’s level, the ministry of internal affairs reported Tuesday. Compared with the previous quarter, outlays rose 4.6%.
A separate report showed wages fell unexpectedly for the first time in 10 months, illustrating the difficult challenge for Prime Minister Fumio Kishida as he tries to make pay gains for workers a centerpiece of his economic agenda. 
 
 
Still, signs of stronger consumer spending to end the year suggest the recovery was building momentum before the omicron variant of the coronavirus triggered a record wave of infections in recent weeks.
The household spending figures are the last big data point the government will use to compile its fourth quarter growth report, due next Tuesday. 
Analysts had been forecasting Japan’s lagging economy would finally get on a more sustainable track in the final months of 2021 after shrinking in five of the prior nine quarters. Now, though, the growth projected for last quarter is at risk of being short-lived.

The Federal Statistics Office said the country's industrial output fell by 0.3% on the month after an upwardly revised increase of 0.3% in November. 
A Reuters poll had pointed to a rise of 0.4% in December.
Production in 2021 was 3.0% higher than in 2020 and 5.5% lower than in the pre-crisis year 2019, the office said.
The German economy expanded by 2.8% last year, compared with 7% in neighbouring France, exposing Germany's vulnerability to the supply chain bottlenecks holding back the manufacturing sector that forms its export-oriented backbone.
Germany is often referred to as the European Union's economic engine, but restrictions introduced in the autumn to fight a fourth COVID-19 wave as well as the supply chain disruptions translated into a contraction of 0.7% in the fourth quarter.
There have been some signs of a brighter start to 2022.
A survey last week showed that Germany's manufacturing sector grew for the first time in six months in January as easing bottlenecks allowed producers to crank up output in order to meet higher demand.
German business morale improved in January for the first time in seven months as easing supply bottlenecks brightened the outlook for manufacturers, promising a strong recovery from the coronavirus pandemic in the spring.

In another positive sign, the sales chief of luxury carmaker Porsche AG expects another record year for sales despite the global semiconductor chip shortage, he told industry magazine Automobilwoche.
The German government last month cut its economic growth forecast for 2022 to 3.6%. Economy Minister Robert Habeck said late last month he expected a slowdown to 2.3% in 2023.

House prices in January rose by 0.3% from December, Halifax said on Monday.
Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, said ""it remains likely that the rate of house price growth will slow considerably over the next year"" even as the limited supply of houses for sale will provide some support to prices.
Affordability was still at historically low levels as house price rises outstripped earnings growth, and younger buyers faced challenging deposit requirements, he said.
""This situation is expected to become more acute in the short-term as household budgets face even greater pressure from an increase in the cost of living, and rises in interest rates begin to feed through to mortgage rates,"" Galley said. 
Last week, the Bank of England raised interest rates for the second time in two months - albeit to a level still below that before the pandemic struck - as it sought to head off inflation running at a 30-year high.

Workers also face higher tax payments from April. 
Compared with January last year, house prices were 9.7% higher than a year earlier, matching December's annual pace of increase, Halifax said.

JAKARTA (Reuters) -Indonesia's economic growth accelerated in the final quarter of last year as consumption perked up following the easing of anti-virus mobility restrictions and as stronger commodity prices pushed exports to record highs.
Southeast Asia's largest economy grew 5.02% on a yearly basis in the October-December quarter, compared with 3.51% growth in the previous quarter, data from Statistics Indonesia showed on Monday. That was roughly in line with the government's prediction and a touch faster than the 4.90% expected in a Reuters poll.
For the whole of 2021, gross domestic product expanded 3.69%, compared with a 2.07% contraction the year before, as the economy recovered from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, the outlook for this year is clouded by rising COVID-19 cases, potential financial market volatility due to a global monetary tightening and Indonesia's own rollback of monetary and fiscal stimulus.
""Indonesia's economy rebounded strongly in the final quarter of last year, but the recovery is now entering a more difficult phase,"" Capital Economics analyst Gareth Leather said in a note.
""Omicron will act as a small obstacle in the first quarter. But a bigger drag will come from falling commodity prices and policy tightening.""
The main stock index, which rose nearly 1% in early trading, pared gains after the data.
Indonesia was hit by a deadly wave of COVID-19 cases in July-August, but mobility curbs were eased towards the end of August as infections fell.
In the fourth quarter, household consumption, which accounts for over half of Indonesia's GDP, grew 3.6%, quickening from the 1% growth in the previous three months.
Investment and public spending also grew faster in the fourth quarter, which Statistics Indonesia head Margo Yuwono attributed to a resumption of government and private sector activities that were halted in the third quarter.
Export growth also picked up to 29.8% from 29.2% in the previous quarter as prices of export products like palm oil, coal and nickel stayed high.
COVID-19 cases are currently rising again in Indonesia due to the spread of the Omicron variant, with Sunday's 36,057 new cases the highest since August. However, authorities have not reimposed strict anti-virus measures.
Josua Pardede, an economist with Bank Permata in Jakarta, said he expects 2022 GDP growth to recover further to between 4.8% to 5%, as the government maintains healthcare and social protection spending.
Bank Indonesia will start unwinding easy monetary policy with hikes in banks' reserve requirement ratio starting in March.
The tightening is seen as preparation for U.S. rate hikes, which have in the past roiled Indonesian financial markets.
Meanwhile, the value added tax rate on most goods and services is set to rise in April, as part of the government's fiscal normalisation policy.

Export contribution to growth could also be curtailed by a ban on overseas shipments of coal in January and a newly implemented domestic sale requirement for some palm oil products.

Investing.com – China’s services activity saw its slowest pace of growth in five months in January, a private survey showed on Monday. Increasing numbers of local COVID-19 cases and the ensuing containment measures hit both new business and consumer sentiment, while employment also fell.
Data released earlier in the day showed that the Caixin services purchasing managers index was 51.4, the lowest since August 2021. The figure was lower than the 53.1 figure reported in December, but still above the 50-mark indicating growth.
The lower-than-expected growth could prompt the government to roll out more measures to support the economy. The People’s Bank of China has already started cutting interest rates and pumping more cash into the financial system, with more measures expected in the following weeks.
Slower growth was due to the COVID-19 outbreaks, according to some services providers, while the rising number of COVID-19 cases globally also slowed demand from overseas. This in turn led to a renewed fall in employment, marking the first decline in the data series since August 2021, according to the survey.
""In December and January, the resurgence of COVID-19 in several regions such as Xian and Beijing forced local governments to tighten epidemic control measures, which restricted production, transportation, and sales of goods,"" Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in a statement accompanying the data release.
""This year, policymakers should make stability their focus. They should prioritize improvements to employment and optimize the structure of the economy.""
Inflation also remains a concern for Chinese service firms, the survey also showed. Input costs rose at a sharper rate in January 2022, while prices charged climbed to a three-month high as some companies passed on higher costs to consumers.
Confidence for the year ahead remained high, although the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic meant that levels were at a 16-month low."

Sales surged 8.2% in the fourth quarter, recovering from a sharp drop in the prior period when the nation’s two most populous states were in lockdown to combat a virus outbreak, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed Monday. The gain outpaced economists’ expectations of a 7.8% increase.
“Consumers enthusiastically returned to discretionary spending following the end of delta related lockdowns,” Ben James, director of Quarterly Economy Wide Statistics at the ABS, said in a statement. 
“Well publicised concerns over product availability and delivery timeliness led to consumers bringing forward their end of year shopping, in conjunction with a re-opening spending splurge due to pent up consumer demand,” he said.
The result will boost policy makers’ confidence that the A$2.1 trillion ($1.5 trillion) economy is on track for a solid recovery from a pandemic-induced contraction in the third quarter. A surge in household spending is among reasons economists expect the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates in the second half of this year.
At the same time, trade data released last week showed a corresponding surge in imports in the final three months of 2021 -- also fueled by high household demand -- which is likely to take a cut out of GDP growth in the period.
The early part of this year is also likely to prove challenging for retailers as a surge in new cases of the omicron variant of coronavirus is prompting caution among consumers. This was reflected in a separate survey of job advertisements, showing a 0.3% fall in January

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy created far more jobs than expected in January but despite the disruption to consumer-facing businesses from a surge in COVID-19 cases, pointing to underlying strength that should sustain the expansion as the Federal Reserve starts to raise interest rates.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed a whopping 709,000 more jobs were added in November and December than previously estimated. Wage gains accelerated last month and the labor pool expanded.
The upbeat report ended days of anxiety among economists and White House officials who had frantically tried to prepare the nation for a disappointing payrolls number.
""This is a strong jobs report,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""The odds of quelling inflation without a recession look better today than yesterday.""
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 467,000 jobs last month, the survey of establishments showed. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 150,000 jobs would be added in January. Estimates ranged from a decrease of 400,000 to a gain of 385,000 jobs.
Employment is 2.9 million jobs below its pre-pandemic peak.
Part of the broad increase in payrolls likely reflected low layoffs after the holiday hiring season, with 10.9 million job openings at the end of December. Though the drop in actual employment in January was in line with prior years, there were large differences at the industry level.
The government also reported that 374,000 more jobs were created in the 12 months through March 2021 than previously reported. January capped President Joe Biden's first year in office, which saw 6.6 million jobs added. Despite the strong economy, Biden's popularity is declining amid soaring inflation.
""We still have a lot of work to do,"" said Biden at the White House. ""Making sure every American has a job, it's a great start, but it's not the finish.""
The labor market resilience could alter expectations that economic growth would slow significantly in the first quarter, after consumer spending exited 2021 with a whimper. The economy grew at a 6.9% annualized rate in the fourth quarter. Growth estimates for the first quarter are below a 2% pace.
Strong employment gains, accompanied by the biggest annual increase in wages since May 2020, pave the way for the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates in March by at least 25 basis points to tame high inflation. Economists expect as many as seven rate hikes this year.
""The report is unequivocally good for the economy, but not for markets as the strength in the numbers presents another data point which supports more aggressively hawkish Fed action,"" said Cliff Hodge, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Wealth in Charlotte, North Carolina.

LABOR POOL EXPANDS
Economists had anticipated a weak jobs report as the government surveyed businesses for payrolls in mid-January, when Omicron infections were peaking. The Labor Department said a record 3.616 million people who had a job were absent during the survey week because of illness.
Workers who are out sick or in quarantine and do not get paid during the payrolls survey period are counted as unemployed in the establishment survey even if they still have a job. Lower-paid hourly workers in industries like healthcare as well as leisure and hospitality, who typically do not have paid sick leave, bore the brunt of the winter COVID-19 wave.
According to the latest government data, paid sick leave was available to 79% of civilian workers in March 2021.
The leisure and hospitality industry added 151,000 jobs in January. Healthcare employment increased by 18,000. There were gains in retail, professional and business services employment as well as transportation and warehousing, and wholesale trade.
Manufacturing payrolls rose by 13,000, but construction employment fell 5,000, likely because of freezing temperatures. Government payrolls increased by 23,000 jobs.
Employment could increase further as coronavirus infections continue to subside. First-time applications for unemployment benefits dropped for a second straight week last week.
The United States is reporting an average of 354,399 new COVID-19 infections a day, sharply down from the more than 700,000 in mid-January, according to a Reuters analysis of official data.
The government introduced new population estimates for the household survey, from which the unemployment rate is derived. The new assumptions had a negligible effect on the unemployment
rate, which rose to 4.0% from 3.9% in December.
But the labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, increased to 62.2% due to the changes in the composition of the population, from 61.9% in December.
The workforce increased by 1.393 million people. The employment-to-population ratio rose to 59.7% from 59.5% in December.
(Graphic: Unemployment rate, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/UNEMPLOYMENT/gdpzymqoqvw/chart.png)
 
Other details of the household survey were strong. Employment increased by 1.199 million jobs. The survey counts people who have a job as employed regardless of whether they got paid during the survey week if they were temporarily absent from their jobs because of illness or other reasons.
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, dropped to 7.1%, the lowest since February 2020, from 7.3% in December.
With some lower hourly paid workers at home, wage growth accelerated. Average hourly earnings surged 0.7%, which raised the annual increase to 5.7%, the largest gain since May 2020.

But Omicron's surge cut the average workweek to 34.5 hours, the shortest since April 2020, from 34.7 hours in December.
""All in all, the U.S. economy appears to be on a strong footing,"" said Noah Williams, an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

(Reuters) - The Canadian economy lost more jobs than expected in January, posting its first decline since May 2021 as the Omicron-driven COVID-19 wave peaked, data showed on Friday, but analysts expect a quick rebound in coming months.
Canada shed 200,100 jobs, roughly matching the losses in January and April 2021, and the jobless rate jumped to 6.5% from a revised 6.0% in December, Statistics Canada said. 
Analysts surveyed by Reuters had expected a loss of 117,500 jobs and the unemployment rate to rise to 6.2%.
""It's a little bit weaker than we expected perhaps, but it really lines up quite well with what we saw last spring,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada economist at TD Securities.
""I think it is something that we look through given that we can connect it quite directly to the lockdowns related to the Omicron variant.""
Canada's largest two provinces, Ontario and Quebec, tightened restrictions as the Omicron variant took hold. Ontario reopened gyms and indoor dining this week, while Quebec reopened restaurants and has allowed some sports activities.
Similar patterns in the previous two COVID-19 waves led to nearly identical job losses, followed by a full rebound within one to three months. Canada's health officials said last week Omicron infections had passed their peak https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/omicron-infections-have-peaked-nationally-canada-official-2022-01-28.
Additionally, Statscan said the jump in the unemployment rate last month was entirely due to temporary layoffs and people scheduled to start work soon, suggesting a looming rebound.
Still, the losses were harsh, particularly in high-contact services. Accommodation and food services shed 112,900 jobs, with another 48,400 net jobs lost in information, culture and recreation.
Despite the disappointing results, analysts said it was unlikely to change the calculus for the Bank of Canada, which is expected to start hiking interest rates in March.
""I don't think this will have a big impact on the Bank of Canada,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. ""I think their view will be that this is entirely related to the temporary restrictions and that it won't last.""

Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem reiterated this week that interest rates would soon rise https://www.reuters.com/business/bank-canada-head-says-unclear-how-quickly-inflation-will-drop-2022-02-02 and that Canadians should expect multiple increases.

(Reuters) - A record number of people, totaling more than 3.6 million, were unable to work due to illness during the week that officials gathered data for the benchmark U.S. monthly employment report, which coincided with the peak in infections from COVID-19.
Labor Department data released on Friday showed that figure was up from nearly 1.7 million in December. The survey for January's report was conducted during the week of Jan. 9-15, the week that infections driven by the highly infectious Omicron variant peaked in the United States. The data on absences from illness dates to 1976.

Investing.com -- The U.S. labor market defied fears of a Covid-driven slowdown in January, adding 467,000 nonfarm jobs in the month, well ahead of estimates. 
The Labor Department also sharply revised up figures for the previous two months' payrolls gains, suggesting that jobs growth has been a lot stronger through the holiday season and the start of 2022 than previously thought. December's figures were revised upward to show a rise of 510,000 jobs rather than the 199,000 originally reported, while November's gain was revised up even more sharply, to 647,000 from the 249,000 previously estimated.
The figures illustrate the difficulties of compiling statistics at a time when the pandemic, and businesses' responses to it, are still dominating economic activity. Despite a rise in layoffs over the last two months as the Omicron wave swept the U.S., the economy appears to have added nearly 1 million jobs in that time. 
In addition, wages continued to rise at a rate that suggests a buildup of inflationary pressure, as workers use their growing leverage with employers in a market characterized by staff shortages. Average hourly earnings rose by 0.7% on the month, rather than the 0.5% expected and their strongest increase since April last year. That took the annual rate of earnings growth up to 5.7%.
Even so, the jobless rate rose to 4.0% of the workforce, from 3.9% in December, and average weekly hours worked fell to 34.5 from 34.7, hitting their lowest since July 2020.
The details of the report suggested that at least some of the distortions created by the pandemic over the last two years are easing, with more workers returning to the labor force. The participation rate, which tracks the proportion of working-age people actually in work, rose to 62.2% from 61.9%, its highest level since April 2020. 
Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Wealth Management, said via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that there was a  ""notable increase in the number of people taking part time jobs alongside full time"" ones, a development which he argued could be due to lower-income groups looking to booster their income, having spent their pandemic savings.
Financial markets responded by pricing in more monetary policy tightening from the Federal Reserve. Money market futures fell to imply a 33% chance that the Fed will hike rates by 50 basis points in March, despite a number of comments from Fed officials this week playing down such a dramatic scenario. The interest-rate sensitive 2-Year Treasury note yield leaped another 11 basis points to 1.30%, while the 10-Year Treasury yield rose 9 basis points to 1.91%. The last time the 10-year yield was that high, the coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, wasn't even known as Covid-19."

Orders for goods grew 2.8% on the month in seasonally adjusted terms after a revised increase of 3.6% in November, figures from the Federal Statistics Office showed.
A Reuters poll of analysts had pointed to a smaller increase of 0.5% on the month.
Domestic orders saw an increase of 11.7% on the month. Orders from the rest of the euro zone decreased 4.2% in December after an increase the previous month of 13.1%.
""Companies are clearly geared up for a recovery and are sitting in the starting blocks for an upswing,"" said LBBW analyst Jens-Oliver Niklasch. 
""What we need now, above all, is an end to coronavirus restrictions and security in the supply chains. Then we can hope for robust GDP growth this year,"" he added.
The economy ministry said the index level pointed to a dynamic economic development once the high order backlog can be worked off, with supply bottlenecks expected to gradually unwind.

""This is a nice growth rate, but it adds to the already high order backlog,"" said Alexander Krueger, an analyst with private bank Hauck Aufhaeuser Lampe. ""The key remains that orders can be processed to a greater extent in the near future.""
German industrial production unexpectedly fell in November, as supply bottlenecks for raw and preliminary materials have led to order backlogs for German manufacturers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week as COVID-19 infections subsided, suggesting that an anticipated slowdown in job growth in January was likely temporary.
The second straight weekly decline reported by the Labor Department on Thursday partially unwound the recent surge, which had boosted initial claims to a three-month high in mid-January.
""The Omicron COVID-19 variant's grip on the U.S. labor market is loosening and job growth should reaccelerate,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 23,000 to a seasonally adjusted 238,000 for the week ended Jan. 29. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 245,000 applications for the latest week. Applications fell sharply in Ohio, Kentucky and Illinois, offseting notable rises in Michigan, California, Indiana and Pennsylvania.
Claims increased from the beginning of January through the middle of the month amid an onslaught of coronavirus infections, driven by the Omicron variant. Business activity, especially in the services sector, was impacted by the latest wave.
A separate survey from the Institute for Supply Management on Thursday showed its non-manufacturing activity index fell to 59.9 last month, the lowest reading since February 2021, from 62.3 in December. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. 
The ISM said the spread of the Omicron variant ""has disrupted operations, especially through reduced staffing levels."" Services businesses also continued to grapple with erratic supplies of materials and higher input prices.
Labor supply constraints were highlighted by the ADP National Employment report https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-private-payrolls-decrease-unexpectedly-january-adp-2022-02-02 on Wednesday, which showed private payrolls declined in January for the first time in a year, raising a strong possibility that the overall economy shed jobs last month.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey published in mid-January, 8.8 million people reported not being at work because of coronavirus-related reasons between Dec. 29 and Jan. 10.
People who are out sick or in quarantine and do not get paid during the payrolls survey period are counted as unemployed in the Labor Department's survey of establishments even if they still have a job with their companies.
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.
WORST LIKELY OVER
The government is likely to report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 150,000 jobs last month after rising by 199,000 in December, according to a Reuters survey of economists. Estimates range from a decrease of 400,000 to a gain of 385,000. The unemployment rate is forecast to be unchanged at 3.9%, underscoring tightening labor market conditions.
There were 10.9 million job openings at the end of December. The workforce is about 2 million people smaller than before the pandemic. Claims have dropped from a record high of 6.149 million in early April of 2020.
The recent labor market disruptions are likely over and job growth will probably pick up. The United States is reporting an average of 433,601 new COVID-19 infections a day, sharply down from the more than 700,000 in mid-January, according to a Reuters analysis of official data.
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 44,000 to 1.628 million in the week ending Jan. 22. 
A total of 2.068 million people were receiving unemployment checks under all programs in mid-January.
""The big drop in initial claims over the past two weeks and the ongoing decline in continued claims indicate that the job growth should bounce back in February,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
""The biggest constraint on hiring in the spring of 2022 will be a worker shortage.""
Underlying strength in the labor market was underscored by a separate report on Thursday from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showing job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers held steady at 19,064 in January. Layoffs were down 76% compared to January 2021.
A third report from the Labor Department showed nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, rebounded at a 6.6% annualized rate last quarter after falling at a 5.0% rate in the third quarter. Economists had expected productivity would rebound at a 3.2% rate. Productivity has been volatile since the pandemic started in the United States two years ago. 

Compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, productivity grew at a 2.0% pace. Productivity increased 1.9% in 2021, slowing from 2.4% growth in 2020.
""We see productivity gains remaining positive as output continues to move higher with less workers,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""Adoption of new technologies during the pandemic will also likely provide a lift over time. But gains may slow as more and more low-productivity jobs are recovered.""

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that factory orders decreased 0.4% in December. Data for November was revised higher to show orders increasing 1.8% instead of 1.6% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders slipping 0.2%. Orders increased 16.9% in 2021.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, is being underpinned by businesses rebuilding inventories. 
Inventory investment surged at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of $173.5 billion in the fourth quarter, the second-largest quarterly increase on record. 
Most economists see more scope for inventories to rise, noting that inflation-adjusted inventories remain below their pre-pandemic level. Sales-to-inventory ratios are also low.
Inventories contributed 4.90 percentage points to the fourth quarter's 6.9% annualized growth pace.
In December, there were decreases in orders for computers and electronic products as well as transportation equipment. But orders for machinery, primary metals and fabricated metal products increased as did those for electrical equipment, appliances and components.
Shipments of manufactured goods rose 0.4% in December after increasing 0.7% in November. Inventories at factories climbed 0.3%. Unfilled orders rose 0.5% after gaining 0.8% in the prior month.
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, rose 0.3% in December instead of being unchanged as reported last month. 

Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 1.3% in December as previously reported.
Business spending on equipment rebounded in the fourth quarter.

The Institute for Supply Management said on Thursday its non-manufacturing activity index fell to 59.9 last month, the lowest reading since February 2021, from 62.3 in December. 
A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 59.5. 
The slowdown in services industry activity was the latest indication that the economy lost considerable momentum in January as coronovarius infections, driven by the Omicron variant, lashed the nation. 
The ISM reported this week that its measure of national manufacturing activity dropped to a 14-month low in January. The ADP National Employment report on Wednesday showed private payrolls fell last month for the first time since December 2020. 
The economy grew at a 6.9% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, helping to boost overall growth in 2021 to 5.7%, the strongest performance since 1984. Growth estimates for the first quarter are mostly below a 2.0% rate.
But the disruption to businesses is probably over, with a rebound in activity anticipated as the Omicron wave subsides.
The United States is reporting an average of 433,601 new COVID-19 infections a day, sharply down from the more than 700,000 in mid-January, according to a Reuters analysis of official data. 
The ISM's measure of new orders received by services businesses dropped to a reading of 61.7, also the lowest in 11 months, from 62.1 in December. Its services industry employment gauge fell to a seven-month low of 52.3 from 54.7 in December.
The decline, which likely reflects absenteeisms as well as worker shortages, suggests job growth slowed in January.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, the government is likely to report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 150,000 jobs last month after rising 199,000 in December. Estimates range from a drop of 400,000 to a gain of 385,000. 
There were 10.9 million job openings at the end of December. 

With services industry hiring slowing, the improvement in supply chains experienced in December partially stalled. While backlog orders increased at a slower pace, the survey's measure of supplier deliveries rose to a reading of 65.7 from 63.9 in December. A reading above 50% indicates slower deliveries. 
That meant services inflation remained high. The ISM's measure of prices paid by services industries slipped to a still-high 82.3 reading from 83.9 in December.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 2.9% month-on-month in December for a 26.2% year-on-year surge. The latter is the highest ever annual reading since measurements started in January 1996, Eurostat said.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 2.8% monthly increase and a 26.1% year-on-year jump.
The December readings were mainly influenced by the soaring prices of energy which increased 7.0% month-on-month and whopping 73.4% year-on-year.
Without the volatile energy component, producer prices went up only 0.5% on the month and 10% year-on-year.
Producer prices typically translate, with a delay, into higher prices for consumers as manufacturers pass on their rising costs.
Euro zone consumer inflation in January increased to 5.1% year-on-year while the European Central Bank wants to keep it at 2% over the medium term.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's services sector picked up sooner than expected last month after a big hit from the Omicron wave of COVID-19 cases, but record price rises are likely to alarm the Bank of England, which is expected to raise interest rates later on Thursday. 
The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) rose to 54.1 in January from December's 10-month low of 53.6 - in contrast to an earlier flash estimate based on data from the further half of January which showed the index down at 53.3.
""Demand has started to recover from the impact of Omicron restrictions and most businesses expect only a temporary slowdown from cancelled bookings and staff absences at the turn of the year,"" IHS Markit economics director Tim Moore said.
Hospitality firms in particular suffered a slump in sales over the Christmas and New Year period.
The broader composite PMI, which includes Tuesday's stronger-than-expected manufacturing PMI, rose to 54.2 in January from 53.6.
Readings over 50 show a majority of firms reported growth, although many economists think Britain's economy as a whole is likely to have shrunk slightly in December and January due to reduced socialising and staff absence caused by COVID.
However, the PMI indicated that businesses were upbeat about 2022.
""Growth expectations for the next 12 months picked up in January and are now the highest since last spring, with staff recruitment difficulties often the only major source of anxiety,"" Moore said.
Official data showed a record number of job vacancies in the final quarter of 2021 with worker shortages more than 50% higher than before the pandemic.
Services businesses' costs rose at the second-fastest rate on record in January - reflecting higher wages, logistics costs, greater energy bills and pricier raw materials - and these expenses were all passed on to consumers. Prices charged rose by the most since the PMI series began in July 1996.
This will feed the BoE's concern that rising consumer price inflation, which hit its highest in nearly 30 years at 5.4% in December, will be slow to fall even once immediate drivers such as energy costs stop rising.

The BoE has seen signs in its own surveys that businesses might raise pay at rates that are inconsistent with its 2% inflation target this year.
But most pay settlements so far are well below the current rate of inflation - bringing real-terms pay cuts for workers which many economists think will slow growth and push down inflation.

460,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 04:10AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone economic growth lost more momentum in January as the bloc's dominant services industry suffered from subdued demand amid tighter restrictions to contain the Omicron coronavirus variant, a survey showed.
Some governments in the currency union have been encouraging citizens to stay at home to try and stop the more virulent variant from spreading while steep price rises, caused in part by supply and labour issues, have also kept demand in check.
IHS Markit's final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as good guide to overall economic health, dropped to 52.3 in January from 53.3 in December, its lowest since February last year and just below the 52.4 preliminary estimate.
""The euro zone economy has slowed further in January after seeing growth weaken in the final quarter of 2021,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The slowdown coincides with virus-fighting containment measures having been tightened to the highest since last May across the euro zone amid the surge in COVID-19 cases linked to Omicron.""
Those measures had a particular impact on the services industry and its PMI fell to a nine-month low of 51.1 from December's 53.1.
Demand growth almost dried up, and the services new business index sank to 51.3 from 52.5, its lowest since April and not far above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
Consumers have seen prices rising sharply in recent months and January was no exception. With input costs rising, firms passed on some of that burden to customers and the composite output prices index rose to 61.9 from 60.6.
The index has only been higher once since IHS Markit began collecting the data in late 2002 - and that was in November.
""A key concern is that inflationary pressures continue to build, with soaring energy prices likely to add further to upward price pressures in coming months,"" Williamson said.

Euro zone inflation is set to rise faster throughout 2022 than previously expected, according to economists polled by Reuters last month, potentially pressuring the European Central Bank to tighten policy.
The ECB, which meets later on Thursday, has so far resisted calls for tighter policy and stuck to its view price pressures would ease this year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls fell for the first time in a year in January as soaring COVID-19 infections disrupted business operations, raising the risk of a sharp decline in employment that would deal a temporary setback to the labor market.
The surprise drop in payrolls in the ADP National Employment report on Wednesday was across all industries and business sizes. It added to a slowdown in manufacturing activity last month in suggesting that the economy lost significant momentum at the start of 2022 as coronavirus cases, driven by the Omicron variant, raged across the nation.
""The good news is that the job market should quickly bounce back as the Omicron variant fades,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
""Underlying demand in the economy is still strong, and businesses are still trying to hire. But the January drop in employment is another reminder that the economy will not fully return to normal until the pandemic is over.""
Private payrolls decreased by 301,000 jobs last month, the first drop since December 2020, after increasing by 776,000 in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would increase by 207,000 jobs.
The broad decline in private payrolls was led by the leisure and hospitality sector, with 154,000 job losses. Trade, transportation and utilities shed 62,000 jobs. Manufacturing employment decreased by 21,000 jobs. Freezing temperatures last month were also a factor, with construction losing 10,000 jobs. 
Employment at small businesses dropped by 144,000 jobs, while medium enterprises laid off 59,000 workers and large companies reduced payrolls by 98,000.
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics and was published ahead of the release on Friday of the Labor Department's more comprehensive and closely watched employment report for January. It has, however, a poor record predicting the private payrolls count in the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics employment report because of methodology differences.
The ADP report counts all active workers as employed regardless of whether they are paid or not during the survey week. In contrast, people who are out sick or in quarantine and do not get paid during the payrolls survey period are counted as unemployed in the BLS survey of establishments even if they still have a job with their companies.
The decline in private payrolls in the ADP report suggests that some workers were laid off because of reduced demand. Businesses were also probably unable to find workers, with so many people at home because of soaring infections.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

Economic growth slowed in January, with an Institute for Supply Management survey on Tuesday showing its measure of national factory activity falling to a 14-month low.
The economy grew at a 6.9% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, helping to boost overall growth in 2021 to 5.7%, the strongest performance since 1984. Growth estimates for the first quarter are mostly below a 2.0% rate. 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey published in mid-January, 8.8 million people reported not being at work because of coronavirus-related reasons between Dec. 29 and Jan. 10. This has left some economists bracing for a decline on Friday in the nonfarm payrolls count for January.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 150,000 jobs last month. Estimates range from a decrease of 400,000 to an increase of 385,000. The economy created 199,000 jobs in December, the fewest in a year.
The White House has been frantically trying to prepare the nation for a disappointing payrolls number, with several officials offering a preview of the report.
""I think the key point, from our perspective, is the underlying strength of the economy,"" Jared Bernstein, a member of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN this week. ""The underlying strength of the job market is ongoing because, as we have seen, the caseloads are turning over.""
The United States is reporting an average of 433,601 new COVID-19 infections a day, sharply down from the more than 700,000 in mid-January, according to a Reuters analysis of official data. 
Demand for labor is strong, with fewer workers available. There were 10.9 million job openings at the end of December.
Economists expect the Federal Reserve will view a decline in payrolls in January as a blip, given the near-record vacancies. 
The Fed last week said it was likely to raise interest rates in March. Economists expect as many as seven hikes this year to tame inflation. 

The labor market is already rebounding as the Omicron wave subsides. First-time applications for unemployment benefits have retreated from a three-month high. 
""The labor market is still in very good shape, regardless of what numbers print, and that points to continued solid wage increases as well,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania.

The central bank is expected to raise its key interest rate by a hefty 100 basis points to 9.5% on Feb. 11 as inflation, which it targets at 4%, shows little signs of slowing.

Inflation across the 19 countries that share the euro picked up to 5.1% in January from 5% in December, far outpacing expectations in a Reuters poll of analysts for a drop to 4.4%, data from Eurostat showed on Wednesday. 
The reading reflected soaring energy prices as expected but unprocessed food inflation also jumped more than 5%, a potential source of political pressure on the ECB as fuel and food prices impact ordinary voters quickly.
Inflation is now more than twice the ECB's 2% target. 
The central bank, which will hold a policy meeting on Thursday, has for months shrugged off data showing prices climbing, arguing that temporary factors are behind the rise and inflation will abate soon on its own. 
But the ECB's track record in forecasting inflation is patchy. It predicted a peak first in November then December, and was forced several times last year to sharply raise its projections.
""They have to recognise there are upside risks and the (inflation) path they laid out in December looks too benign,"" said Dirk Schumacher, euro zone economist at French investment bank Natixis. ""Underlying price pressures remain high and put the ECB in an awkward position."" 
While the U.S. Federal Reserve has abandoned the narrative that inflation is ""transitory,"" the ECB has stuck with this assessment, arguing that wage growth, a precondition of durable inflation, is still muted and underlying price growth is weak. 
Although core inflation slowed, it remained above the ECB's target and also beat market expectations by a wide margin.
Inflation excluding food and fuel prices, closely watched by the ECB, slowed to 2.5% from 2.7% while a narrower measure that also excludes alcohol and tobacco products slowed to 2.3% from 2.6%. Both figures were well above expectations.
High inflation is why markets see 30 basis points of interest rates hikes by the end of the year, despite the ECB's insistence that any rate change is ""very unlikely"". 
""Euro area headline inflation is on track to exceed ECB staff projections by more than 100 basis points in the first quarter"" Pictet Wealth Management strategist Frederik Ducrozet said. ""We now expect the ECB to bring its deposit rate back to zero in two 25 bp rises in March and June 2023."" 
Analysts polled last month https://www.reuters.com/business/euro-zone-inflation-burn-hotter-ecb-rates-stay-ice-2022-01-19 expected the first ECB rate hike only in the second half of 2023 but a growing number see earlier moves as inflation remains high.
The euro rose 0.3% to $1.13050, touching a one-week high to the dollar, as investors assessed the chances that the ECB might signal a faster path for policy tightening on Thursday.
QUESTIONS
The ECB expects inflation to fall back under 2% by the end of this year, partly because of weak wage growth. A long list of influential policymakers have questioned this narrative, however, warning that risks are skewed towards higher figures.
While wage growth is indeed weak so far, unemployment fell to 7% in December, an all-time-low for the euro zone, and is already well below the ECB's own forecasts, suggesting that wage pressures could also exceed projections. 

ECB policymakers meeting on Thursday are almost certain to keep policy unchanged after extending stimulus through a complex package in December.
While ECB President Christine Lagarde may acknowledge that inflation is at risk of exceeding projections, she is also expected to push back on mounting rate hike expectations, repeating that any rate changes this year are unlikely.

464,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 08:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Employment at U.S. companies declined in January by the most since the early days of the pandemic as the omicron variant of the coronavirus registered a swift yet likely temporary blow to the nation’s labor market.
Businesses’ payrolls fell by 301,000 last month in a broad-based decline, according to ADP Research Institute data released Wednesday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 180,000 rise.
The decrease in employment, due to a surge in Covid-19 infections that led to some business closures and restrained activity, exacerbates tightness in the job market. A near-record number of unfilled positions and increased employee turnover are contributing to capacity constraints. Still, employment growth is seen picking up as the spread of the omicron variant wanes.
U.S. stock futures pared gains following the data while 10-year Treasury yields remained slightly lower. 
The data precede Friday’s monthly employment report from the Labor Department, which is currently forecast to show that private payrolls increased by 113,000 in January. The ADP figures don’t always follow the same pattern as the Labor Department’s data.
Broad-Based Decline
Service-provider employment fell by 274,000 in January, the biggest drop since April 2020, led by leisure and hospitality. Trade, transportation and utilities also posted a sizable decline. 
Payrolls at goods producers decreased by 27,000, reflecting declines in both construction and manufacturing.
“The labor market recovery took a step back at the start of 2022 due to the effect of the Omicron variant and its significant, though likely temporary, impact to job growth,” Nela Richardson, ADP’s chief economist, said in a statement.
Payrolls at companies with fewer than 50 employees dropped 144,000 in the month, while large businesses shed 98,000 jobs.
ADP’s payroll data represent firms employing nearly 26 million workers in the U.S.

465,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 05:32AM ET</span>",,,,,,"MADRID (Reuters) -Foreign tourism to Spain rebounded 64% last year from 2020's historic coronavirus crash but failed to reach half its pre-pandemic levels, data showed on Wednesday, as shifting travel restrictions and ongoing outbreaks put off many visitors.
Just over 31 million tourists visited in 2021, up from 19 million in 2020, the National Statistics Institute (INE) said, but that was a far cry from the 83.5 million who came in 2019.
Overall, tourists spent 34.82 billion euros ($39.30 billion) in Spain last year, compared with 19.79 billion in 2020 and 91.91 billion in 2019.
Even though Spain loosened entry restrictions in the spring in the hope of salvaging its summer season, an ever-changing patchwork of restrictions and guidelines across Europe kept a lid on foreign travel.
A sluggish start to international vaccine campaigns at the beginning of the year and the delayed launch of the European Union COVID passport also took their toll.
But arrivals data for December beat expectations despite the advance of the highly contagious Omicron variant.
Some 2.95 million tourists visited the country in December, the data showed compared to just 649,000 the previous year, driving a 76% increase in expenditure.
""December has turned out better than we expected and that helps us meet the end of year forecasts"", Minister of Industry, Commerce and Tourism Reyes Maroto said in a statement.

She said she was optimistic that 2022 would bring ""close to a full recovery of the sector"".
""Spain will use its advantages compared to other competing destinations,"" she added.

""A sustained reduction in inflationary expectations is not yet being seen,"" the bank said in a report. ""They continue to exert significant upward pressure on consumer demand and price dynamics. The Bank of Russia takes this into account in its monetary policy decisions.""
Annual inflation in Russia has accelerated to its highest level since early 2016, well above the central bank's 4% target. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the bank to raise its key interest rate by 100 basis points to 9.5% on Feb. 11.

The number of people registering as jobless rose 0.55% in January from December, or by 17,173 people, to leave some 3.12 million out of work, the data showed.
Still, the increase was the slowest reported in 25 years for the month of January, when unemployment usually rises sharply as many temporary agricultural, hospitality and retail contracts end.
Joblessness rose 1.8% in agriculture and 1.5% in services but declined 2.8% in the construction industry, the data showed.
On an annual basis, the number of people registering as jobless fell 21% from the previous January, when Spain had yet to ramp up its COVID-19 vaccination programme and had imposed restrictions on travel and socialising to rein in cases.
Despite the uptick in unemployment, Spain added 71,948 net jobs over the month, with the bulk in services, separate data from the Social Security Ministry showed.

The number of people supported by a state-backed furlough scheme edged 2.4% higher to 105,043.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. manufacturing activity fell to a 14-month low in January amid an outbreak of COVID-19 cases, supporting the view that economic growth lost steam at the start of the year.
But the survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Tuesday marked the third straight month of signs of improvements in labor and supplier delivery performance. Unfinished work increased at its slowest pace in 15 months and manufacturers remained upbeat on demand.
Still, Timothy Fiore, chair of the ISM manufacturing business survey committee, noted ""shortages of critical intermediate materials, difficulties in transporting products and lack of direct labor on factory floors due to the COVID-19 Omicron variant.""
""While off to a somewhat rocky start, 2022 will be a good year for U.S. manufacturing,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
The ISM's index of national factory activity dropped to a reading of 57.6 last month, the lowest since November 2020, from 58.8 in December. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would drop to 57.5. All of the six biggest manufacturing industries - machinery, food, transportation equipment, computer and electronic products, chemical products, and petroleum and coal products reported moderate to strong growth. 
(Graphic: ISM PMI, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/mypmnjkgevr/ism.png) 
The economy hit a soft patch in December which appeared to have persisted in early 2022 as coronavirus infections, driven by the Omicron variant, surged across the country. The ensuing disruptions at businesses and schools have led economists to anticipate a sharp slowdown in job growth in January.
Makers of chemical products reported ""massive interruptions to our production due to supplier COVID-19 problems limiting their manufacturing of key raw materials like steel cans and chemicals."" Similar sentiments were echoed by their counterparts in the fabricated metal products industry.
Transportation equipment manufacturers complained that ""transportation, labor and inflation issues continue to hamper our supply chain and ability to service our customers."" Machinery manufacturers said they were constrained by ""transportation restrictions and a lack of supplier manpower."" 
But makers of nonmetallic mineral products are seeing light at the end of the tunnel, reporting that ""the supply chain crunch may be loosening a bit."" 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading largely flat. The dollar slipped versus a basket of currencies. Prices of longer-dated U.S. Treasuries fell.
PRICES MARCH HIGHER
The economy grew at a 6.9% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, helping to boost overall growth in 2021 to 5.7%, the strongest performance since 1984. Economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Monday slashed their first-quarter gross domestic product growth estimate to a 0.5% rate from a 2.0% pace, citing Omicron and reduced government payments to households.
The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index fell to 57.9 last month, the lowest reading since June 2020, from 61.0 in December. It was the second straight monthly slowdown in new orders. But customer inventories remain depressed, which could limit the pace of moderation in orders growth.
The replenishing of inventories will likely underpin manufacturing and sustain the economic expansion. 
A measure of order backlogs tumbled to 56.4%, the lowest since October 2020, from 62.8% in December, pointing to some easing in supply bottlenecks. That was reinforced by a gauge of supplier deliveries, which was little changed at 64.6. A reading above 50% indicates slower deliveries to factories. 
Still, prices at the factory gate marched higher. The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers increased to a reading of 76.1 from 68.2 in December, suggesting that inflation could remain uncomfortably high for a while. 
The Federal Reserve last week said it was likely to raise interest rates in March, with economists expecting as many as seven hikes this year to tame inflation. 
Despite Omicron's spread, factories hired more workers last month, with the ISM survey's measure of manufacturing employment increasing to a 10-month high, though turnover remained high.
The rise in factory employment is welcome amid fears of a possible decline in nonfarm payrolls in January.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 150,000 jobs last month after rising by 199,000 in December. Estimates range from a drop of 400,000 jobs to an increase of 385,000. The Labor Department is scheduled to publish January's employment report on Friday.
But worker shortages remain an obstacle. A separate report from the Labor Department on Tuesday showed job openings increased 150,000 to 10.9 million at the end of December, close to the all-time high of 11.098 million reached in July. 
(Graphic: JOLTS, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gkplgjdxnvb/jolts.png) 

The nearly broad rise was led by accommodation and food services, which reported an additional 133,000 job openings. Layoffs hit a record low.
""It seems clear from these data that the labor market got even tighter at the end of December than was apparent in the December payroll data,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. ""These data suggest that any signs of weakness in job growth in January would not represent a weakening in labor demand.""

Job openings, a measure of labor demand, rose 150,000 to 10.9 million on the last day of December, not too far from an all-time high of 11.098 million reached in July, the Labor Department said on Tuesday in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 10.3 million vacancies. 
The nearly broad rise was led by accommodation and food services, which reported an additional 133,000 job openings. There were also notable increases in vacancies in information, nondurable goods manufacturing as well as state and local government education.
But job openings decreased in finance and insurance, and wholesale trade.
The job openings rate was unchanged at 6.8%. Hiring fell 333,000 to 6.3 million. The decline was most pronounced in professional and business services, where hiring fell by 159,000 jobs. The hiring rate was little changed at 4.2%.
The government reported last month that nonfarm payrolls increased by 199,000 jobs in December, the fewest in a year.

The JOLTS report also showed the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs decreased by 161,000 to a still-high 4.3 million in December. Fewer workers quit in healthcare and social assistance, accommodation and food services industries as well as construction.
But there were more resignations in the nondurable goods manufacturing industry. The quits rate was little changed at 2.9%. The number of quits decreased in the South.

The IHS Markit Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers'Index tumbled to 46.1 in January from 49.4 in December, taking it well below the 50 threshold that separates growth from contraction.
The weakest reading in the index since last March is a setback for Mexico after a marked slowdown in the economy at the end of 2021 left it battling recession. 
The index has remained below 50 every month since March 2020, and reached a trough of 35.0 in April 2020 during the initial lockdown phase of the coronavirus pandemic.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that construction spending rose 0.2% after advancing 0.6% in November. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending gaining 0.6%. Construction spending increased 9.0% on a year-on-year basis in December. It rose 8.2% in 2021.
Spending on private construction projects rose 0.7% in December. Outlays on residential construction surged 1.1%.
Single-family homebuilding spending accelerated 2.1%, while outlays on multi-family housing projects rose 0.4%. 
Homebuilding remains constrained by higher prices for building materials, especially framing lumber. The United States last November nearly doubled the duties on imported Canadian softwood lumber to 17.9% from 9% after a review of its anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders. Residential investment contracted for a third straight quarter in the fourth quarter.

Investment in private non-residential structures like gas and oil well drilling was unchanged in December. Spending on structures also dropped for a third straight quarter in the October-December period.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt is considering replacing a popular bread subsidy with cash payments for the poor to protect the budget from soaring global wheat prices, but domestic inflation and a history of protests could make the government opt for a less ambitious reform.
Under the existing program, more than 60 million Egyptians, or nearly two thirds of the population, get 5 loaves of round bread daily for 50 cents a month, little changed since countrywide ""bread riots"" prevented a price hike in the 1970s.
The handout is a lifeline to the poor, but is widely criticized as wasteful. High global prices for wheat, which Egypt imports on a vast scale, led President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to say last year that it was time to tackle the bread subsidy.
Ali Moselhy, the minister in charge of subsidies, told Reuters that inflation, which has climbed in recent months to 6% from 4% earlier in 2021, made it harder to replace the support for bread and other food with cash handouts.
""When inflation is stable, then you can introduce cash,"" he said. 
Moselhy has said he personally favours giving people money specifically to buy bread. Eligible Egyptians already get a monthly $3.20 voucher for other subsidised food.
However, he said a broader idea to introduce unconditional payments, favoured by many economists as the most efficient welfare system, risked driving up prices by putting more cash into circulation at a time of rising inflation. 
The government aims to draw up a plan for reformed food subsidies in time for March budget preparations, officials have recently said.
Moselhy said that for now, the government had not taken a decision on what to do, and was focused on improving the database of recipients, with the intention of ""finding out who needs what.""
That could mean that any changes are more limited in nature, perhaps trimming the program through means testing, restricting how many people in a household are eligible, or increasing the price of subsidized bread. 
Bassant Ibrahim, 36, a housewife living in Beheira, north-west of Cairo, said any such restrictions should not hurt families like hers, which relies on the subsidies to bolster her husband's $180-a-month teaching salary and feed four children. 
""There are rich people with cards who you can sift out, but the poor shouldn't have to pay the price,"" said Ibrahim, who said the family daily ate the ten loaves of bread they received, sometimes finishing them by lunchtime. 
BREAD RIOTS
Sisi previously oversaw reforms to fuel and power subsidies. In recent months his government raised the price of subsidised vegetable oils and sugar, following increases in commodity and shipping costs.
The food subsidy programme currently costs the government about $5.5 billion, with higher wheat prices expected to add $763 million to the 2021/2022 budget, according to finance ministry data.
Officials have tinkered with the bread scheme over the years, trying to restrict eligibility as Egypt's population has grown, repeatedly shrinking the weight of a subsidised loaf, and offering people credit for bread they did not collect. 
But the price of a subsidised basic loaf has remained constant at 5 piastres ($0.003) since the 1980s. 
To make a dent in the food commodity import bill would require deeper changes to the bread allowance, something governments have been wary of since an attempt scrap subsidies in 1977 set off the riots, which continued for days until the decision was reversed.
Sisi's adjustments to subsidies so far and his announcement that it was time to tackle bread have triggered grumblings, but street protests are banned and extremely rare.
Ahmed Mohamed, 24, a married gardener in Cairo with two children, said he could live without the government paying for his daily bread. 
""There are other people who need it more than I do,"" he said.

However, Ahmed Darwish, a former minister who oversaw a transition to a smart subsidy card system in the early 2000s, said authorities would have to step carefully to reassure people that any changes will not leave them overly exposed. 
""Until the government says that this subsidy would be increased with inflation, they have to comfort people,"" Darwish said.

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 56.2 in January from 56.5 in December, matching July last year as the lowest reading since February 2021. A reading above 50 shows growth in the sector.
""COVID-19 yet again hit performance with output growth slowing notably,"" Shreeya Patel, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement.
The output index fell to its lowest level since June 2020 at 51.5 from 53.3 in December as a lack of materials and the pandemic weighed on growth.
Canadian provincial governments have only just started to ease restrictions rolled out to slow the spread of the Omicron variant.
The restrictions as well as port congestions and adverse weather contributed to a deterioration in vendor performance.
The suppliers' delivery times index was at the fifth lowest in the 11-year history of the series, falling to 27.8 from 28.7 in December.
More encouragingly, there were signs of easing inflationary pressures, with the measure of input prices dropping to the lowest level in 11 months, and stronger demand.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada's economy climbed to above pre-pandemic levels for the first time in November, bolstering a strong fourth quarter even as activity stagnated in December with the emergence of the Omicron variant, official data showed on Tuesday. 
The economy grew 0.6% in November from the previous month, beating expectations for a gain of 0.3%, but growth in December was likely flat, Statistics Canada said. The agency said annualized gross domestic product in the fourth quarter was likely up 6.3%, beating the Bank of Canada's forecast of 5.8%.
""While not far from the Bank of Canada's latest estimate, it is a bit higher yet, and is simply another turn of the screw, all but ensuring a rate hike at their next meeting on March 2,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, in a note.
The central bank held its key interest rate unchanged last week, but said hikes were coming as Canada's economy no longer needed extraordinary support to deal with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Money markets are betting on a first increase in March, with a total of six rate hikes this year. The Canadian dollar was trading 0.1% higher at 1.2689 to the greenback, or 78.81 U.S. cents. [BOCWATCH]
The December and fourth-quarter GDP numbers are preliminary estimates, with official data coming next month. Economic activity is now 0.2% above February 2020 levels, Statscan said.
Canada's goods-producing sector expanded 0.5% in November, while the service-producing sector grew 0.6%. Services were bolstered by higher attendance at major league sporting events, including World Cup men's soccer qualifying matches.

Still, the economic momentum of November slowed in December as the Omicron variant took hold and provinces tightened restrictions. While analysts expect a hit in January, they see the economy bouncing back again relatively quickly.
""Economic data is expected to look weaker in January with Omicron spread,"" said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at RBC Economics, in a note. ""But with restrictions already starting to ease, that softening is expected to be short-lived.""

BERLIN (Reuters) -A big fall in German retail sales as COVID-19 curbs kept people out of shops over the usually busy Christmas period underlined its flagging economic recovery, but signs that jobs and production are picking up suggested a brighter start to 2022. 
Data on Tuesday showed retail sales tumbled 5.5% in December in real terms, a much steeper decline than the 1.4% forecast by a Reuters poll of economists.
Sales of textiles, clothing, shoes and leather goods were hit especially hard by a requirement that customers in non-essential shops show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or recovery, part of measures imposed to halt the Omicron wave of the virus.
""The usual end-of-year fireworks clearly backfired this time,"" said Alexander Krueger, an economist at Hauck Aufhaeuser Lampe Privatbank. ""The new restrictions are a big part of this. Many people are probably also cutting back on spending as they are afraid of high energy costs."" 
Surveys of Germany's labour market and manufacturing sector struck a more positive note, suggesting that producers were starting to crank up output as supply shortages ease. 
COVID measures and supply chain problems that have affected Germany's large auto industry contributed to a final quarter contraction of 0.7% in Europe's biggest economy compared to Q3 and kept growth to 2.8% in all of 2021. 
The German economy underperformed the wider euro zone, and notably its second-biggest economy, France, which grew 7% last year, the most since 1969, data on Friday and Monday showed.
France largely lifted pandemic-related restrictions towards mid-year. It has reported 3,489 infections per 100,000 people over the last seven days, compared with 1,285 in Germany. 
Worries about rising prices, especially for energy, among inflation-wary Germans are likely to hit retailers further in 2022, industry association HDE said, warning that almost 16,000 shops could disappear this year.
It said online shopping was likely to drive growth in the sector this year, expanding 13.5% compared to 1.2% for physical shops, and called for the bar to be lifted on non-essential shopping by unvaccinated people to help smaller retailers.
""This measure, which is useless in the fight against the pandemic, must finally be dropped nationwide,"" HDE Chief Executive Stefan Genth said in a statement. 
About a quarter of the German population is not vaccinated against COVID-19. 
SALES STABLE ON YEAR
Retail sales is a volatile indicator and often subject to revisions.
The Federal Statistics Office said sales figures adjusted for prices remained stable on the year, compared with an average Reuters poll forecast for an increase of 1.1% compared with December 2020. 
""The December decline is probably related to the fact many retail outlets have started asking for proof of COVID-19 vaccination or recovery, and the impact of seasonal adjustment due to Christmas,"" it said in a statement.

Compared with February 2020, the month before the coronavirus crisis hit Germany, retail sales in December 2021 were up 0.7%.
Recent surveys have suggested morale is improving among German businesses as supply bottlenecks ease.

LONDON (Reuters) - British manufacturing output grew at the fastest pace in six months in January as global supply chain pressures began to ease and factories largely shrugged off a wave of cases caused by the Omicron variant of coronavirus, a survey showed on Tuesday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) showed the output index rose to 54.5 in January - its highest since July 2021 - from 53.6 in December, stronger than an initial flash estimate of 53.8.
Factories hired workers at the second-fastest rate in 11 years, and they reported some easing of inflation pressures.
""Although supply chain constraints continued to stymie growth, there were signs that these were past their peak, a factor contributing to a slight easing in purchase price inflation,"" IHS Markit said.
Softening price pressures will be welcomed by the Bank of England, which is widely expected to raise interest rates on Thursday for the second time in less than two months due to concern that high inflation could prove persistent.
The headline PMI edged down to a four-month low of 57.3 in January from 57.9 in December, which reflected the weakest growth of new orders since February 2021 as well as faster deliveries from suppliers - a factor that depresses the index as in normal times it is a sign of spare capacity.
Britain's economy only regained its pre-crisis size in November, and many economists reckon it shrank by around 0.5% over December and January when a surge of COVID-19 cases hit hospitality and office staff were advised to work from home where possible.
On Sunday, the Confederation of British Industry said its members estimated private-sector growth in the three months to January was the weakest since the three months to April, when many businesses were still operating under lockdown.

However, Tuesday's PMI data pointed to some relief in the supply-chain disruption that has contributed to consumer price inflation rising to its highest in nearly 30 years.
The PMI showed manufacturers' input prices rose at the slowest pace since April 2021 while output prices rose at the slowest pace since May - although in outright terms both price increases are far above their long-run average.

The BoE said 71,015 mortgages were approved in December, up from 67,859 in November and above all forecasts in a Reuters poll that had pointed to 66,000 approvals.
Britain's housing market has been robust through most of the pandemic, and there were surges in mortgage lending ahead of the expiration of temporary tax breaks in June and September 2021.
Tuesday's BoE data - alongside robust house price growth figures for January from mortgage lender Nationwide - pointed to continued momentum, despite rising BoE interest rates and a squeeze on incomes from fast-rising consumer price inflation.
""Though the market isn't as frenetic as it was last year, there is no shortage of demand from both purchasers and those looking to remortgage before the Bank of England raises the base rate again,"" said Simon Gammon, managing partner at mortgage broker Knight Frank Finance.
Nationwide's data showed house prices in January were 11.2% higher than a year earlier, the biggest annual increase since June 2020.
Britain was hit by a wave of cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus in December, which hurt consumer spending as many people chose to stay at home and avoid socialising.
Net consumer lending rose by 831 million pounds ($1.12 billion) in December, broadly as expected and down from November's 999 million pound increase.
""Consumers exercised a touch more caution as Omicron COVID-19 cases surged at the end of last year, but it still suggests the economy didn't collapse,"" Adam Hoyes, economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said.
Lending has been picking up after a slump during the pandemic when many richer households built up savings due to reduced opportunities to spend on travel and socialising.

Consumer credit rose by 5.5% on an annualised basis in the final quarter of 2021, the biggest rise since the three months to the end of February 2020, before the start of pandemic restrictions in Britain.

The impetus will come primarily from the expected growth of 13.5% in online retail this year, compared to 1.2% in traditional retail, HDE said in a statement, adding big retail chains are likely to fare better than smaller companies.

""Total sales will grow, but some of the players are clear losers,"" HDE Chief Executive Stefan Genth said, referring to small businesses and shops in city centre areas as unvaccinated people cannot enter non-essential retail shops in Germany.

IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a five-month high of 58.7 in January from December's 58.0, below an initial ""flash"" estimate of 59.0 but comfortably above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.

""The improvement is by no means evenly spread across the euro zone, however, with resurgent growth in Germany, the Netherlands and Austria contrasting with slowdowns in Italy, Spain and Greece and near-stalled production in France.""
Raw material prices continued to soar, albeit at a slower pace than in December, and factories passed more of that burden on to consumers. The output prices index climbed to 72.7 from 70.2 - the second-highest reading in almost two decades.

Euro zone inflation is set to burn hotter throughout 2022 than previously expected, according to economists polled by Reuters last month, which could pressure the European Central Bank to tighten policy once the Omicron wave of the pandemic passes.
The ECB, which meets on Thursday, has resisted calls for tighter policy, sticking to the view price pressures will ease this year.

LONDON (Reuters) - British grocery inflation rose to 3.8% in the four weeks to Jan. 23, with the prices of savoury snacks, crisps and beef rising the most, market researcher Kantar said on Tuesday, underlining the growing cost-of-living squeeze facing many households.
The outcome represented a 0.3 percentage point increase from Kantar's report for December and taken over the course of a 12-month period adds an extra 180 pounds ($242) to the average household's annual grocery bill.
""We're now likely to see shoppers striving to keep costs down by searching for cheaper products and promotions,"" said Fraser McKevitt, Kantar's head of retail and consumer insight.
With official UK data showing overall consumer prices rose in annual terms by 5.4% in December, the highest rate in almost 30 years, inflation is a hot political topic.
Kantar said supermarket sales fell by 3.8% over the 12 weeks to Jan. 23 year-on-year, though sales were 8.0% higher than the same period in 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic impacted trading.
Market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) again outperformed its big four rivals with a year-on-year sales decline of 1.9% over the 12 weeks.
Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons saw sales fall 4.8%, 5.3% and 8.5% respectively.
While Tesco's market share moved up 0.6 percentage points to 27.9%, marking a full year of gains, its three biggest rivals all lost share.
Kantar also noted there was evidence of people scrubbing up as work from home directives ended and socialising increased.
It said razor blade sales rose by 14% and spend on deodorant increased by 20% as Britons strived to make themselves presentable.

House prices jumped by 0.8% in January, following a 1.1% increase in December. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a 0.6% increase last month.
House prices stood 11.2% higher than their level in January 2021, the fastest annual growth since June and again outstripping the consensus forecast for a rise of 10.8%.
Other surveys have also pointed to strong house price growth, even after the expiry of temporary tax breaks on property purchases during the pandemic.
As in other countries, British house prices surged during the pandemic as people rushed to move to bigger homes with gardens. Nationwide said demand was likely to cool this year. 
""Reduced affordability is likely to exert a dampening impact on market activity and house price growth, especially since household finances are also coming under pressure from sharp increases in the cost of living,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide chief economist.
Consumer price inflation hit an almost 30-year high of 5.4% in December and looks set to peak at around 6% in April, according to the Bank of England, which is due to publish mortgage lending data at 0930 GMT on Tuesday.

""We expect households' real disposable income to fall by around 1.5% this year as inflation surges and taxes rise,"" said Samuel Tombs, economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics.

While prices for manufactured goods fell, nearly all other prices were higher and energy prices were up 19.7% over one year following increases on global oil markets.

Not using the EU-agreed methodology to calculate inflation, INSEE said its consumer price index rose slightly to 2.9% from 2.8% in December, reaching its highest level since September 2008.

But inflation accelerated further. Output charge inflation reached a five-month high, while input price growth, or cost inflation, hit a six-month peak. 

""As headwinds from higher costs do not look likely to dissipate in the near-term, pressure on margins is expected to persist across the Russian manufacturing sector in 2022,"" Jones said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexico's economy contracted for a second straight quarter in the last three-month period of 2021, according to official data published on Monday, putting it in a technical recession and joining regional powerhouse Brazil, whose economy fell back into negative territory last year.
Gross domestic product (GDP) in Latin America's second largest economy shrank in the fourth quarter by 0.1% from the previous three-month period in seasonally adjusted terms, preliminary data published by Mexico's INEGI national statistics agency showed.
That beat out expectations in a Reuters poll https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexicos-economy-likely-entered-recession-fourth-quarter-2022-01-28 for GDP to contract in the fourth quarter by 0.3%, after the economy declined by 0.4% in the third quarter.
Mexico's Deputy Finance Minister Gabriel Yorio said Friday that talk of a ""technical recession,"" https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexicos-finance-ministry-says-talk-technical-recession-imprecise-2022-01-28 defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction, does not take into account coronavirus-related economic volatility and global supply chain issues.
Yorio said that global supply bottlenecks, increased prices for raw materials, and higher costs for ground transportation and sea shipping are weighing on the economy.
""With its weak Q4 outturn, Mexico has joined Brazil in technical recession, an extremely disappointing result that leaves real GDP in Mexico a whopping 4% below its mid-2019 pre-COVID peak,"" said Fiona Mackie, regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean at Economist Intelligence Unit.
Brazil's weakened economy is in danger of sinking deeper into recession this year ahead of October's presidential election, as anxiety over the vote and steep interest rate rises continue to hurt growth, according to a Reuters poll https://www.reuters.com/article/latam-economy-poll-idUSL1N2U00P3.
Jonathan Heath, a board member of Mexico's central bank and one of its most outspoken, jumped into the fray over where the Mexican economy stood at the end of last year.
""The idea that the economy is in a recession because there were two consecutive quarters with a negative GDP rate is a simplification of what a recession is,"" said Heath on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
""If there are two quarters in a row with negative GDP, it increases the possibility that there is a recession, but that is not enough by itself. A recession has to comply with three requirements: depth, duration, and spread. For now, we comply only with duration.""
RECOVERY TO REMAIN SLUGGISH
Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service analyst Renzo Merino predicted that economic growth in 2022 would be lower than Mexican authorities are aiming for, bearing in mind persistent negative momentum in investment.
""This situation may be repeated in the coming years, generating additional pressure on fiscal accounts in the remainder of (President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's) six-year term, given the possibility of a lower performance of revenues and a growing rigidity in public spending,"" Merino said. 
Nikhil Sanghani, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, took a more cautiously optimistic view.
""We doubt that Mexico will remain mired in recession for much longer. Supply shortages appear to be easing which should allow auto production to strengthen while the drag to output from the outsourcing law will soon begin to fade,"" said Sanghani.
Sanghani forecast the recovery will remain sluggish over coming quarters, however, weighed down by a recent tightening of COVID restrictions and austere fiscal policy.
INEGI's figures showed that tertiary activities, which comprise the service economy, contracted by 0.7% in the fourth quarter from the previous three-month period in seasonally adjusted terms.
The decline of ""the labor intensive tertiary sector (is) a reflection of the impact of the recently approved outsourcing law which led to a large decline in services rendered to corporates, businesses,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos said in a research note.
Primary activities, which encompass farming, fishing and mining, rose by 0.3%, while secondary activities, which include manufacturing, increased by 0.4%.
The economy expanded by 5.0% for full-year 2021, the data showed, after shrinking by 8.5% in 2020 in what was Mexico's worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
""The strong growth in 2021 is more the result of the arithmetic effect generated by the low base of comparison in 2020 and less due to genuine growth derived from productive capacity,"" said Alfredo Coutino, head of Latin America analysis at Moody's Analytics.

GDP grew by 1.0% in the fourth quarter versus the same period a year earlier, data showed.
INEGI will publish final GDP data for the fourth quarter on Feb. 25.

Consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries (HICP), rose 5.1% year on year compared with 5.7% in December, the Federal Statistics Office said.
The national consumer price index (CPI) rose by 4.9% on an annual basis, easing from 5.3% in December.
A Reuters poll of analysts had forecast the CPI rate at 4.3% and the HICP figure at 4.7%.
""The decline in the inflation rate is only due to the fact that the effect of the temporary reduction in VAT in 2020 no longer distorts the year-on-year comparison upwards as in the previous months,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Marco Wagner said.
At the same time, supply bottlenecks and high energy prices significantly reduced the expected positive effect, analysts said.
As surveys of German and foreign companies have so far shown no significant easing of supply chain disruption, the year-on-year CPI rates are likely to stay ​​above 4.5% for a few more months, said Michael Heise, chief economist at HQ Trust.
""In view of the serious geopolitical tensions with Russia, betting on a desired drop in energy prices in the near future appears to be wishful thinking,"" Heise added.
Euro zone inflation hit 5% last month, the highest on record for the 19-country currency bloc, but the ECB expects it back under its 2% target in both 2023 and 2024, even without policy tightening, as one-off pressures ease.
ECB chief economist Philip Lane told a Lithuanian newspaper last week the central bank would tighten policy if inflation was seen holding above its target, but such a scenario appears less likely for now.
The ECB meets next on Thursday but no policy move is expected as the bank unveiled a complex package of measures in December.

Contrary to earlier projections, the German Economy Ministry said last week it expects consumer price inflation to rise further this year.

""There were significant differences between the euro countries due to the pandemic. In spring the Omicron wave should have subsided and the economy should grow more strongly again.""
A surge in infections caused by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus caused COVID-19 measures to be reimposed in many European countries at the end of last year.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's factory output shrank for the first time in three months in December as a decline in machinery production outweighed a small rise in autos, casting a cloud over the strength of the economic recovery.
Retail sales posted their third straight month of year-on-year gains in December as low coronavirus cases encouraged shoppers. Record infections this month driven by the Omicron variant, however, are expected to have hit consumer sentiment.
Factory output lost 1.0% in December from the previous month, official data showed on Monday, pulled down by a decline in output of general-purpose and production machinery, including chip-making equipment and engines used in manufacturing.
That meant that output, which fell faster than the 0.8% decline forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, dropped for the first time in three months.
""Output especially fell among capital goods makers, probably due to the strong impact from the chip shortages,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""It suggests its impact is widening even though the focus has been on the car industry.""
Automakers have been forced to curb production even as demand in key markets such as China rebounds, while they also have had to contend with soaring semiconductor demand at consumer electronic companies.
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Co, the world's biggest car seller, said this month it expected production to fall short of an annual target of 9 million vehicles for its current business year that runs until end-March due to the drag from the chip shortage.
Last week, motor maker Nidec Corp's third-quarter operating profit dipped as rising material prices and a shortage of semiconductors squeezed margins.
The data showed output growth of cars and other vehicles slowed to 1.5% from the previous month in December, much weaker than the 43.7% surge in November and a 15.9% jump in October.
Some companies in the car industry had weathered the competition for chip supply better than others, a government official said.
""Procurement is increasing, but the situation is different from firm to firm,"" the official said.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expected output to grow 5.2% in January and 2.2% in February.
The forecasts did not include production cuts made after the Jan. 10 survey deadline, the official said.
OUTLOOK RISKS
The world's third-largest economy is projected to expand an annualised 4.5% in the current quarter, a Reuters poll showed this month, but some economists warned of downside risks to the rosy projections.
First-quarter growth faces a hit to private spending from the coronavirus spread and declines in car output, said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""There's a possibility growth will be negative in the January-March period, though it will depend on the infection situation,"" Shinke wrote in a report.
Separate data showed retail sales rose 1.4% in December from a year earlier, smaller than the expected 2.7% rise.
That marked the third straight month of increase for sales, which were lifted by stronger demand for general merchandise and food and beverages, though year-on-year growth slowed.

Japan has seen a surge in COVID-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant in recent weeks, forcing the government to roll out tighter curbs that now cover 70% of the country.
An index gauging consumer confidence fell 2.4 points in January to its lowest since August, a government survey showed, in a sign the record infections due to the Omicron variant were hurting sentiment.

Investing.com – China’s economy continued its slowdown in January 2022, with manufacturing output falling and the latest COVID-19 outbreaks limiting consumer spending. Smaller businesses bore much of the pain, with a private survey focused on smaller, export-oriented firms falling below the 50-mark indicating growth.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Sunday showed that the manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was 50.1. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a 50 figure, and the index was at 50.3 in December 2021.
The non-manufacturing PMI was 51.1, lower than the previous month’s reading of 52.7.
The slowdown added to other tailwinds that the Chinese economy faces, including falling home sales and the latest COVID-19 outbreaks that led to travel restrictions and lockdowns in some cities. Authorities are aiming to stabilize the economy ahead of a key political leadership meeting later in the year, with the People’s Bank of China cutting interest rates and officials pledging more fiscal support earlier in the month.
“The weak PMI indicates the policy easing measures from the government have not yet been passed to the real economy,” Pinpoint Asset Management Ltd. chief economist Zhiwei Zhang said in a note.
“We expect the government will step up policy support in coming months, particularly through more fiscal spending.”
Meanwhile, the Caixin manufacturing PMI, also released on Sunday, was at 49.1. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com had predicted a 50.4 reading, while December’s figure was 50.9.
January and February are normally slow production periods due to the Lunar New Year holidays. In 2022, activity was also impacted by the government’s orders for steel plants to reduce output, aimed at reducing air pollution ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics starting on Feb. 4.
Manufacturers also continued to see higher costs in January, with input prices rising at the fastest rate in three months. “That could drive the producer price index up and narrow the room for monetary policy,” China Renaissance Securities Hong Kong’s Bruce Pang told Bloomberg.
The downward pressure on the economy could continue in the near term, with restricted Lunar New Year holiday celebrations impacting consumption, while production also remains low, according to Bloomberg chief Asia economist Chang Shu.
“The authorities have made a sharp pivot to increase policy support. This should cushion the slowdown, but the impact may not be discernible until late in the first quarter after holiday-related distortions in activity have subsided.”"

Declines in production of general machinery and chip-making devices pushed overall factory output down 1% from the level in November, when it surged a record 7%, the economy ministry reported Monday. Analysts had expected a 0.6% drop. 
A separate report showed retail sales also dropped 1% in December, slipping on a month-on-month basis for the first time since August even before the omicron variant began its rapid spread.
 
Despite December’s drop in production, a solid quarter for manufacturing suggests Japan’s economy was getting back on track at the end of last year after shrinking in five of the previous nine quarters. For the quarter, production increased 1% on a seasonally-adjusted basis.
Record cases of the virus at home and abroad, driven by the fast-spreading omicron variant, have clouded the outlook in recent weeks. Supply-chain disruptions that have bedeviled manufacturers everywhere spurred the International Monetary Fund last week to predict slower global growth this year.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...     
“We expect production to pick up in January, driven by strong exports to the U.S. with a tailwind from a weak yen. Even so, supply chain problems caused by outbreaks of the omicron variant as well as China’s slowdown remain downside risks.”

Manufacturers surveyed by the economy ministry said they planned to raise output by 5.2% this month and another 2.2% in February, results that suggest continued recovery in the factory sector.
Still, supply chain problems persist. Over the past few weeks,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp., Japan’s biggest company by sales, was forced to announce several cuts to its January production due in part to component shortages stemming from a Covid outbreak at a Japanese factory operated by a seatbelt and airbag maker.
Covid Outbreak at Seat Belt Supplier Behind Toyota Output Cuts
In the U.S., the Biden administration last week warned that the global semiconductor shortage will persist until at least the second half of this year, promising long-term strain on a range of including automakers and the consumer electronics industry. 
Factory output will be key to keeping Japanese growth going this quarter, given surging omicron cases that have triggered renewed restrictions across the country that are likely to deter shopping and eating out. With the 7-day average of infections now topping 70,000 nationally, quasi-emergencies were declared for Tokyo and most other major business centers this month.
A purchasing manager’s index of manufacturing activity released last week showed the sector holding up in January, with the gauge climbing to its highest level in at least three years. The survey showed new order growth quickening at the fastest pace in nine months. 
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s stimulus package is also expected to start supporting the economy this year with a range of measures including subsidies to ease the impact of rising gasoline prices on consumers.

The figures from a monthly Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank survey will give mixed signals to the Bank of England on the persistence of inflation pressures - and the extent to which they will hamper growth - as it considers a widely expected rate rise this week.
A record 49% of the 1,200 businesses surveyed between Jan. 4 and Jan. 18 said they expected to raise prices, up from 45% in December. 
But the proportion expecting to raise pay by 2% - well below the current 5.4% rate of inflation - fell to a five-month low of 41% from 48% in December.
The number planning pay rises of 3% fell to 21% from 26% and those share of those planning 4% pay rises dropped to 12% from 14%.
""Businesses remain cautious about the pandemic and are facing into challenges from rising cost pressures although many are raising their prices in response,"" Lloyds Bank economist Hann-Ju Ho said.

Overall confidence slipped from December and hiring intentions were the lowest since August - although 46% of firms still plan to increase their headcount over the next 12 months.
A monthly survey from the Confederation of British Industry on Sunday showed that private-sector growth in the three months to January was the weakest since April, reflecting a big hit to many firms from a wave of Omicron cases in December and January.

502,"<span>Jan 30, 2022 06:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economy continued to slow at the start of the year, with manufacturing output slipping and Covid-19 outbreaks curbing consumer spending.
The official purchasing managers’ surveys released on Sunday showed a moderation in factory production and services in January. Small businesses bore the brunt of the pain, with a separate private index dropping to its lowest in almost two years.
The disruptions add to the woes facing the Chinese economy, with home sales falling and consumption sluggish due to tightened restrictions to contain the spread of the highly-contagious omicron virus variant. Beijing is seeking to stabilize the economy ahead of a key political leadership meeting later this year, with the central bank already cutting interest rates and officials pledging more fiscal support. 
“The weak PMI indicates the policy easing measures from the government have not yet been passed to the real economy,” Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management Ltd., wrote in a note. “We expect the government will step up policy support in coming months, particularly through more fiscal spending.”
The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index declined to 50.1, the National Bureau of Statistics said Sunday, remaining slightly above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction. The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, fell to 51.1.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
Looking ahead, we expect downward pressures on the economy to persist in the near term, with restrained celebrations around the Lunar New Year holiday dragging on consumption, while production remains in low gear. The authorities have made a sharp pivot to increase policy support. This should cushion the slowdown but the impact may not be discernible until late in the first quarter, after LNY-related distortions in activity have subsided.

The PMI gauge of small companies dropped to 46 this month, the lowest since February 2020 and taking a contracting streak to a ninth month. 
That was echoed by the Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index, also released on Sunday, which fell to 49.1, the worst in almost two years. The private survey focuses on smaller, export-oriented firms compared with the official manufacturing PMI.
Chinese factories often see a production lull in January and February as workers head home for the Lunar New Year holidays. Activity has also been affected this year by the government’s orders for steel plants to trim output to reduce air pollution ahead of the Winter Olympics in Beijing which begin Friday.
Travel restrictions and lockdowns in some places are curbing spending on services, with the PMI sub-index for the sector dropping sharply to 50.3, the lowest since August. Residents in places where there have been recent Covid-19 outbreaks, including Beijing, Shanghai and the northern port city of Tianjin, have been urged to not leave the cities unless necessary.
Chinese Holiday Travel Makes a Slow Recovery as Omicron Spreads
Manufacturers were also squeezed by higher costs in January, with input prices rising at the fastest rate in three months, according to the official PMI data. 
“That could drive the producer price index up and narrow the room for monetary policy,” said Bruce Pang of China Renaissance Securities Hong Kong.
Construction activity continued to cool this month, with the sub-index falling to 55.4, NBS figures show, suggesting sentiment remained subdued given the property downturn and the limited effect that government spending on infrastructure is having so far. The approaching holiday and cold winter may have also had some impact on building.

503,"<span>Jan 30, 2022 02:20AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's factory activity slowed in January as a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and tough lockdowns hit production and demand, but the slight expansion offered some signs of resilience as the world's second-largest economy enters a likely bumpy new year. 
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) registered 50.1 in January, remaining above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction, but slowing from 50.3 in December, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Sunday.
Analysts had expected the PMI to fall to 50. 
The official results contrasted with those in a private survey https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/chinas-jan-factory-activity-contracts-covid-lockdowns-bite-caixin-pmi-2022-01-30 of mostly small manufacturers in coastal regions, which showed activity fell at the fastest rate in 23 months. 
China's economy started last year strong, reviving from a sharp pandemic-induced slump, but it started losing momentum in the summer, weighed down by debt problems in the property market and strict anti-virus measures that hit consumer confidence and spending. 
Rising raw material costs and soft demand have also eroded corporate profit margins. Profits at industrial firms rose at their slowest pace in December for more than a year and a half.
With the real estate slump expected to drag on through at least the first half of this year and the emergence of more infectious COVID-19 variants, China's central bank has started cutting interest rates and pumping more cash into the financial system to lower borrowing costs. Further modest easing steps are expected in coming weeks. 
Stability will trump everything ahead of a once-in-five-years Communist Party congress this year, with policymakers looking to ward off a sharper slowdown that could undermine job creation.
RISKS OF EASING, COVID CURBS
But such easing carries risks, as other global central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve are preparing to raise interest rates, which could spur potentially destabilising capital outflows from emerging markets like China. 
The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday cut its China 2022 growth forecast to 4.8%, from 5.6% previously, reflecting the property woes and the hit to consumption from strict COVID-19 curbs.
""Industrial activity slowed due to weak domestic demand,"" said Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. ""The service sector is also affected adversely by the outbreaks in many cities.""
""The weak PMI indicates the policy easing measures from the government have not yet been passed to the real economy... We expect the government will step up policy supports in coming months, particularly through more fiscal spending.""
A sub-index in the official PMI for production stood at 50.9, down from 51.4 in December, while new orders fell to 49.3 from 49.7.
While China's new COVID-19 cases have been low compared with many other countries, a surge of infections since late December in the manufacturing hub of Xian forced many auto and chip makers to shut operations. Production has gradually returned to normal as the city emerged from a lockdown.
Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd last month temporarily adjusted operations at its Xian manufacturing facilities for NAND flash memory chips, but it said on Wednesday that production has returned to normal. 
Output in Tianjin, which battled an outbreak of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, was also affected.
At the same time, the government is trying to limit industrial air pollution levels ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics, starting on Friday. China has told steel mills in northern regions to cut production until mid-March.
A survey on China's sprawling services sector also showed growth slowing in January, as virus containment measures hit consumer sentiment. 

China's official composite PMI, which combined manufacturing and services, stood at 50.1 in January compared with 52.2 in December.
China's economy grew 4.0% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, its weakest expansion in one and a half years.

504,"<span>Jan 29, 2022 09:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity contracted at the sharpest rate in 23 months in January, underscoring the huge economic costs from the country's zero-COVID approach as surging cases and tough containment measures weighed on output and demand, a private survey showed on Sunday.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.1 in January - its lowest level since February 2020, when the economy was still suffering from country-wide COVID-19 lockdowns in the early days of the pandemic. 
Economists in a Reuters poll had expected the index to ease to 50.4 from December's 50.9 but still point to some growth. The 50 mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The unexpectedly weak reading is likely to reinforce market expectations that policymakers need to roll out more support measures to stabilise the faltering economy. China's central bank has already started cutting interest rates and pumping more cash into the financial system to bring borrowing costs down, and further modest easing steps are expected in coming weeks.
A sub-index for factory output stood at 48.4, down from 52.7 in December, with firms surveyed reporting reduced intakes of new business and as a recent surge in COVID-19 cases and tough anti-virus measures impacted production, the survey showed.
Demand also took a dive, as new orders fell at the fastest clip since August this year and export orders shrank the most since May 2020. Exports were one of the few bright spots for China's economy in the second half of last year.
That led to renewed pressure on the job market, with a gauge for employment dropping to the lowest in almost two years. 
""From December to January, the resurgence of Covid-19 in several regions including Xian and Beijing forced local governments to tighten epidemic control measures, which restricted production, transportation and sales of manufactured goods,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group said.
""It became more evident that China's economy is straining under the triple pressures of contracting demand, supply shocks and weakening expectations.""
A surge of COVID-19 cases since late December in the manufacturing hub of Xian forced many auto and chip makers to shut operations, although production has gradually returned to normal as the city emerged from a lockdown.
Inflationary pressures also edged higher in January, while manufacturers' confidence towards the year ahead picked up as firms remain convinced China would be able to get COVID-19 under control. 
The world's second-largest economy got off to a strong start in 2021, rebounding from 2020's pandemic-induced slump, but it began losing steam in the early summer, weighed down by growing debt problems in the property market and COVID-19 outbreaks that hit consumer spending. 

The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday cut its forecst for China's 2022 growth to 4.8%, from 5.6% previously, reflecting the property downturn and the hit to consumption from strict coronavirus curbs.

LONDON (Reuters) - British businesses grew at the slowest pace since April 2021 during the past three months, after demand for face-to-face services slumped due to the Omicron variant of coronavirus, the Confederation of British Industry said on Sunday.
Britain's economy only recovered to its pre-pandemic size in November, before being hit by the highly infectious Omicron variant which led to government advice to work from home and restrictions on hospitality in Scotland and Wales. 
""Consumer services have borne the brunt of 'Plan B' restrictions and general Omicron caution, with activity here shrinking sharply,"" CBI economist Alpesh Paleja said.
The CBI's monthly growth index - which is based on quarterly growth rates from its previously published surveys of manufacturers, retailers and other services businesses - fell to +12 in January from +21 in December.
That was the lowest reading since April's, which covered a three-month period when pubs, restaurants and non-essential retailers were largely closed due to a previous COVID wave.
COVID-19 cases in Britain have fallen sharply since a peak in early January, and most economists think output will soon recover.
But there are headwinds for many businesses from sharply rising inflation, which hit its highest in nearly 30 years in December and is forecast to exceed 6% in April when regulated household energy bills rise.
""Consumer-facing firms will also have to contend with a deepening squeeze on household budgets,"" Paleja said.

The Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates on Thursday to 0.5% from 0.25%, the second increase in less than two months.
The CBI survey was based on responses from 477 firms between Dec. 20 and Jan. 17.

The April to November shortfall was C$73.70 billion ($57.75 billion) compared with a C$232.02 billion deficit over the same eight months in 2020/21, the data showed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending fell in December, suggesting the economy lost speed heading into the new year amid snarled supply chains and raging COVID-19 infections, while annual inflation increased at a pace last seen nearly 40 years ago.
Wage inflation is also building up amid an acute shortage of workers. Private industry wages rose strongly in the fourth quarter, posting their largest annual gain since the mid-1980s, other data showed on Friday. Mounting inflation pressures could force the Federal Reserve to aggressively hike interest rates, stifling growth, economists warned.
""No one wants to go back to the 80s, but the economy is. Can stagflation from an overly aggressive Fed be next?"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""The Fed let its guard down and now they risk it all by saying they might have to move faster and higher on interest rates.""
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, dropped 0.6% last month after gaining 0.4% in November, the Commerce Department said. The decline was in line with economists' expectations.
The data was included in the advance gross domestic product report for the fourth quarter published on Thursday. The economy grew at a 6.9% annualized rate last quarter, accelerating from the July-September quarter's 2.3% pace. That helped to boost growth in 2021 to 5.7%, the strongest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.4% in 2020.
Consumer spending dropped in December likely as the result of Americans starting their holiday shopping in October for fear of empty shelves at stores because of rampant shortages of goods, including motor vehicles. Spending on goods fell 2.6%, led by automobiles.
Outlays on services gained 0.5%, lifted by healthcare.
Sky-rocketing coronavirus infections driven by the Omicron variant slowed the improvement in supply chains, with workers calling in sick. Worsening shortages kept inflation elevated last month.
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components, rose 0.5% after a similar gain in November. The so-called core PCE price index accelerated 4.9% year-on-year in December, the biggest rise since September 1983. The core PCE price index increased 4.7% in the 12 months through November.
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
WAGE PRESSURES GROWING
Inflation is running way above the Fed's flexible 2% target. The U.S. central bank on Wednesday said it was likely to raise interest rates in March.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities is predicting seven rate hikes this year. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) on Friday raised its forecast to five rate increases from four.
""The challenge now is to tamp down inflation without allowing the flame on the overall economy to go out,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton in Chicago. ""There is no road map for doing this after inflation has surged.""
Signs that inflation could remain stubbornly high were reinforced by a separate report from the Labor Department on Friday showing the Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, rose 1.0% in the fourth quarter after increasing 1.3% in the July-September period.
Labor costs surged 4.0% on a year-on-year basis, the largest rise since the fourth quarter of 2001, after increasing 3.7% in the third quarter.
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation as it adjusts for composition and job quality changes.
The labor market is viewed as being at or near maximum employment. There were 10.6 million job openings at the end of November.
Wages and salaries rose 1.1% last quarter after increasing 1.5% in the third quarter. They were up 4.5% year-on-year, the largest increase since the second quarter of 1990. Private industry wages rose 1.2% and shot up 5.0% year-on-year, the most since the first quarter of 1984. Benefits for all workers rose 0.9% after a similar gain in the July-September quarter.
But high inflation is cutting into wage gains, eroding consumers' purchasing power. The rising cost of living and pandemic fatigue pushed consumer sentiment back to a 10-year low in January.
The report from the Commerce Department showed consumer spending adjusted for inflation dropped 1.0% in December after slipping 0.2% in November.
The decline in the so-called real consumer spending set consumption on a slower growth trajectory heading into the first quarter, which could pull overall economic growth lower.
Consumer spending rose at a 3.3% rate last quarter. Growth forecasts for the first quarter are so far below a 2% rate, with some economists predicting an outright decline in output.
Still, growth is expected to rebound by the second quarter as the current Omicron wave of infections subsides and supply constraints ease. Consumers are sitting on more than $2 trillion in excess savings accumulated during the pandemic.

It is, however, unclear when and how much of these savings will be spent. Economists also note that the bulk of the savings are by higher income households, who tend to be savers and some of the money could go towards retirement.
""To our minds, despite the strength of price and wage inflation, it is disappointingly weak real economic growth that will prevent the Fed from delivering a full-blown Ratemaggedon this year,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.

The European Commission's monthly economic sentiment index fell to 112.7 points in January from a revised 113.8 in December. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 114.5 points.

The decline of the overall index was mainly a result of less optimism in industry, where the index eased to 13.9 from 14.6 and in services, where it fell to 9.1 from 10.9.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's economy expanded at its fastest pace in two decades last year but slowed down in the fourth quarter as public and private spending slipped amid soaring inflation.
Gross domestic product grew 5% from a historic 10.8% slump the previous year, preliminary data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) showed on Friday.
That marked the fastest growth since 2000 but missed the government's 6.5% target.
In September, the INE made an unprecedentedly sharp cut to its first and second quarter growth readings that threw out all forecasts and triggered a wave of downward revisions, but the government stuck to its bullish forecast.
While Spain has so far lagged behind neighbouring France, which posted 7% annual growth after a milder contraction in 2020, it fared better in the fourth quarter, likely due to its light touch approach to the spread of Omicron.
Despite lower spending, an 8.5% jump in investment drove 2% quarter-on-quarter growth in the October-December period, slowing from the 2.6% during the previous three months but comfortably beating a 1.4% forecast from analysts polled by Reuters.
France's economy grew by just 1.7% over the same period.
Agriculture was Spain's fastest expanding sector over the quarter, growing by some 9% as the economically vital autumn grape and olive harvests got underway.
In annual terms, the economy grew 5.2% from the fourth-quarter of 2020, led by a 19.4% leap in the hospitality sector, which has benefited from the widespread rollout of coronavirus vaccines and the lifting of restrictions on socialising.
Social Security Minister Jose Luis Escriva said a delayed recovery in tourism, which accounted for some 12% of GDP before the pandemic, was still holding back growth but he pointed to solid jobs data as a reason for optimism.

Unemployment is at its lowest level since before the financial crisis while job creation was at its fastest since 2005 last year, helping drive record tax collection.
Bolstered by the arrival of more European Union recovery funds and an expansive budget, the government expects 7% growth this year, although the central bank forecasts a more modest 5.4% expansion.

PARIS (Reuters) -France posted its strongest growth in over five decades last year, hitting 7% as the euro zone's second-biggest economy bounced back from the COVID-19 crisis faster than expected, data showed on Friday.
Despite a resurgence of COVID-19 underway, the strongest boom in a generation bolsters President Emmanuel Macron's economic credentials less than three months from an April election in which he is widely expected to run for a second term.
The economy grew 0.7% in the final three months of the year after a particular strong third quarter when it grew 3.1%, the INSEE statistics agency said in a preliminary report.
Economists polled by Reuters had on average forecast fourth quarter growth of 0.5%.
The better-than-expected end to the year meant the economy grew 7% in 2021 as a whole, the strongest since 1969, after an 8% contraction in 2020 when strict coronavirus lockdowns were in force.
""The French economy has rebounded spectacularly and that's erased the economic crisis,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on France 2 television.
""There are still some sectors that are still having trouble, like tourism and hotels, but most are recovering very strongly and that's creating jobs.""
Businesses and consumers are once again having to contend with tighter health restrictions as France faces its fifth wave of COVID-19, which has pushed new infection levels to record levels.
While the economy is starting 2022 on a softer footing, the central bank has said the economic impact of the current wave should be minimal as the economy has largely adapted to living with a pandemic.
""All told, the economic stage is set for April’s presidential election. Emmanuel Macron will clearly be pleased with the 2021 GDP numbers,"" Capital Economics senior Europe economist Jessica Hinds said.
""But whether Macron can convince the French electorate to give him another five years is still not a done deal,"" she added.
Macron currently has a comfortable lead over the closest contenders from the conservatives and far right who are trying to push identity politics and security to the fore in the election where Macron is much less at ease. 
INSEE said that the economy had recovered to pre-crisis levels of activity in the third quarter as a vaccination campaign gained momentum and the government eased COVID-19 restrictions.
In the fourth quarter, growth was driven by consumer spending rising 0.4% even though it slowed from an exceptionally strong 5.6% jump the previous quarter as the economy re-opened after a lockdown.

Business investment rose 0.8% in the fourth quarter after gaining only 0.1% in the previous three months.
Growth was also boosted by companies replenishing depleted inventories, with stock-building adding 0.4 percentage points in the fourth quarter after representing a 0.7% drag in the third quarter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy notched its strongest growth in nearly four decades in 2021 after the government pumped trillions of dollars in COVID-19 relief, and is seen forging ahead despite headwinds from the pandemic, strained supply chains as well as inflation.
A surge in gross domestic product in the fourth quarter as businesses replenished depleted inventories to meet strong demand for goods was the final push. Last year's robust growth reported by the Commerce Department on Thursday supports the Federal Reserve's pivot towards raising interest rates in March.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters on Wednesday after a two-day policy meeting that ""the economy no longer needs sustained high levels of monetary policy support,"" and that ""it will soon be appropriate to raise"" rates.
""While Omicron will lead to weaker growth in the first quarter, activity is expected to rebound nicely once the latest pandemic wave abates and supply-chain glitches ease,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
""The Fed will need to be 'humble and nimble' as it navigates underlying economic strength, worsening labor shortages, and stubbornly high inflation.""
The economy grew 5.7% in 2021, the strongest since 1984, as the government provided nearly $6 trillion in pandemic relief. It contracted 3.4% in 2020, the biggest drop in 74 years. 
President Joe Biden quickly took credit for the stunning performance, which he said was ""no accident."" 
Biden's popularity is falling amid a stalled domestic economic agenda after Congress failed to pass his signature $1.75 trillion Build Back Better legislation. 
""We are finally building an American economy for the 21st Century, and I urge Congress to continue this momentum by passing legislation to make America more competitive, bolster our supply chains, strengthen our manufacturing and innovation, invest in our families and clean energy, and lower kitchen table costs,"" Biden said in a statement.
Gross domestic product increased at a 6.9% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, the government said in its advance GDP estimate. That followed a 2.3% growth pace in the third quarter. 
Growth is 3.1% above its pre-pandemic level.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP growth rising at a 5.5% rate. 
The momentum, however, faded by December amid an onslaught of COVID-19 infections, fueled by the Omicron variant, which contributed to undercutting spending as well as disrupting activity at factories and services businesses. But there are, signs that infections have peaked, which could lead to increased demand for services by spring. 
Inventory investment increased at a $173.5 billion rate, contributing 4.90 percentage points to GDP growth, the most since the third quarter of 2020. Businesses had been drawing down inventories since the first quarter of 2021. 
Spending shifted during the pandemic to goods from services, a demand boom that pressured supply chains. Excluding inventories, GDP grew at a moderate 1.9% rate.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.
BALANCING ACT
Some economists viewed the modest growth in the so-called final sales as a sign that the economy was set to slow down significantly, especially if not all the inventory accumulation was planned. They also worried that rate hikes as well as reduced government aid, especially the loss of the childcare tax credit, could hurt demand. 
So far inventory-to-sales ratios remain low by historical standards. 
""Fed policymakers will have to be extremely careful at threading the needle when they raise interest rates as every other Federal Reserve in history has raised interest rates too high and brought the economy crashing back down,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.  
Growth last quarter was also lifted by a jump in consumer spending in October before retreating considerably as Omicron raged. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, grew at a 3.3% rate after rising at a 2.0% pace in the third quarter.
A decrease in purchases of motor vehicles, which are scarce because of a global chip shortage, was offset by increases in spending on healthcare as well as at membership clubs, sports centers, parks, theaters and museums.
Inflation increased at a 6.9% rate, the fastest since the second quarter of 1981, way above the Fed's 2% target. That resulted in income at the disposal of households dropping at a 5.8% rate, which also limited consumer spending. 
Still, households remained cushioned by huge savings, which were at $1.34 trillion. Wages surged at an 8.9% rate before adjustment for inflation, reflecting a labor market that is experiencing an acute shortage of workers, with 10.6 million job openings at the end of November. 
Though the labor market took a step back in early January as Omicron surged, it is at or near maximum employment. A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for jobless benefits dropped 30,000 to a seasonally adjusted 260,000 during the week ended Jan. 22. 
There were sharp declines in claims in Illinois, Kentucky, Texas, New Jersey, New York as well as Pennsylvania. 
Support to GDP growth last quarter also came from a rebound in business spending on equipment. But government spending fell at both the federal and state and local levels. 
Trade made no contribution after being a drag on GDP growth for five straight quarters, while investment in homebuilding contracted for a third consecutive quarter. The sector is being constrained by expensive building materials, which has resulted in a record backlog of homes yet to be built. 

Despite the economy's struggles at the start of the year, most economists believe the run of good fortunes will prevail. Growth estimates for this year top 4%.
""This year may well be an even better year for the economy,"" said Scott Hoyt, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Growth will slow and monthly job gains will lag last year's lofty rates. Nonetheless, the economy should be near full employment and inflation near the Fed's target by year's end.""

The rate fell to 13.33% from 14.57% in the previous quarter, a decline that Economy Minister Nadia Calvino called ""spectacular"" and comfortably below the 14.20% forecast by economists polled by Reuters.
The highly seasonal National Statistics Institute (INE) reading was the lowest since the third quarter of 2008, when it stood at 11.23%, and the lowest for a fourth quarter since 2007's 8.57%.
Private-sector hiring accounted for all of the 153,900 jobs added over the period, with agriculture leading the gains as farms took on extra workers to help with the autumn olive and grape harvests.
But it was the tourism-reliant Canary Islands that added the most jobs among Spain's regions, reporting a 7% jump as the Atlantic archipelago attracted crowds of winter sunseekers from northern Europe.
Foreign tourism to Spain accelerated in the last quarter of 2021 but remains roughly 40% below pre-pandemic levels.
Over 2021, Spain added more than 840,000 new jobs - the biggest jump since 2005 - largely due to increased hiring in the services industries.
Since peaking at 16.26% in the third quarter of 2020, when Spain was reeling from the impact of COVID-19's devastating first wave, unemployment has dropped for five straight quarters.
The arrival of the highly infectious but less virulent Omicron variant pushed up cases to record highs in December, leading to a spike in sick-leave absences.

But a light-touch response from the government, which declined to reintroduce curbs on movement and business activity, meant that any structural impact on employment was limited.
Thursday's INE reading did not include the roughly 100,000 workers still enrolled in the government furlough scheme at the end of last year.

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan's economy grew last year at its fastest pace in more than a decade, driven by strong tech exports during the COVID-19 pandemic to support people working and studying from home, as well as demand for chips and recovering consumer confidence.
For 2021, initial gross domestic product (GDP) growth was put at 6.28%, compared with 3.11% the previous year, preliminary data from the statistics agency showed on Thursday. 
That was the fastest pace since an expansion of 10.25% in 2010.
GDP grew a preliminary 4.88% in the fourth quarter of 2021 from a year earlier after a rise of 3.7% in the period from July to September. That was well above the increase of 3.8% forecast in a Reuters poll.
However, it lagged growth of 7.43% in the second quarter and 8.92% in the first quarter.
As a key hub in the global technology supply chain for giants such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Taiwan's economy has outperformed many regional peers during the pandemic as it benefited from robust demand for tech exports as more people turned to working and studying from home.
A global shortage of semiconductors has also filled Taiwan chip makers' order books, and driven them to expand production at home.
Taiwan's exports rose 29.4% in 2021 to a record high, and the economy continues to benefit from strong global demand for its high-tech goods and chips.
Total fourth-quarter exports soared 26.01% on the year in U.S. dollar terms, the agency said.
Statistics official Wu Pei-hsuan said domestic consumption had recovered in the fourth quarter after being affected by government controls to curb a short-lived domestic COVID-19 outbreak that began in May.
However Capital Economics said exports were unlikely to grow at such a rapid pace this year.
""With high inflation and fading fiscal support dragging on retail spending in many key exports markets, we expect exports to level off this year,"" it said in a note.
Another risk is a slowdown in the economy of China, Taiwan's top trading partner. 

China's economy grew 8.1% in 2021 and 4.0% in the final quarter, faster than expected but still its weakest pace since the second quarter of 2020, off the back of weak consumption and a property downturn.
Taiwan will release on Feb. 24 its revised GDP figures, including growth estimates for the full year.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's industrial firms saw December profits grow at their slowest pace in more than a year and a half, pointing to cooling demand amid mounting economic challenges for the world's second-largest economy.
The downbeat data adds to expectations of strong supportive measures from the People's Bank of China in the coming months to stabilise a faltering economy. COVID-19 outbreaks have hit consumer spending, a property market downturn is deepening and exports look set to slow. 
Hobbled by an easing in factory-gate inflation, industrial profits rose 4.2% year-on-year, the slowest rate since April 2020, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). That compares with a 9% increase in November and a 24.6% gain in October.
Figures for the whole of last year, however, showed a stellar rebound, with industrial profits surging 34.3% to 8.7 trillion yuan ($1.37 trillion) after just 4.1% growth in 2020 when COVID-19 shutdowns pummelled the economy. It was the biggest jump since 2011 when the NBS began to disclose data more regularly.
The December figures point to a weak year this year and industrial profits could even decline in some months due to a high base of comparison in 2021, said Wang Jun, an economist at Zhongyuan Bank.
He also noted that a huge number of struggling small firms were not captured by official data, which only looks at companies with annual revenue of over 20 million yuan from their main operations. 
""Constraining factors are building for China's central bank. With the U.S. Federal Reserve set to raise interest rates in March, time is running out for the PBOC to further ease policy,"" said Wang. 
The PBOC, which has flagged more measures are in store, has sprung into action over the past few weeks, unexpectedly cutting the borrowing costs of its medium-term loans for the first time since April 2020 and lowering benchmark lending rates.
Zhu Hong, a senior NBS statistician, noted the steep slowdown in industrial profit growth over November and December and said operational pressures facing manufacturers and a high number of loss-making companies were cause for concern. 
""In the next step, we will...implement tax and fee cuts as well as measures to ensure supply and stabilise prices, in addition to vigorously helping firms to tackle difficulties,"" he said.

China's economy grew 4.0% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, marking its weakest expansion in one-and-a-half years. The economy is set to expand by 5.5% this year, an adviser to the government's cabinet said last week.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit in goods widened to a record high in December as imports increased for a fifth straight month amid strong domestic demand, suggesting that trade likely remained a drag on economic growth in the fourth quarter.
But imports are helping to replenish depleted inventories, with the report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showing strong restocking at retailers and wholesalers last month. Solid inventory accumulation likely offset the impact on gross domestic product from the larger trade gap, prompting some economists to raise their growth estimates for the last quarter.
""Strong demand and shifting consumer preferences during the pandemic led to a surge in imports that continues to outstrip exports and is contributing to all-time highs in the deficit,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.
The goods trade deficit rose 3.0% to an all-time high of $101.0 billion last month. It was also the first time that the deficit breached the $100 billion threshold. The rebuilding for inventories could keep the goods trade deficit wide at least through the first half of this year.
Goods imports increased 2.0% to $258.3 billion, likely as the backlog at ports continued to be cleared. The increase in imports was driven by capital goods, motor vehicles and consumer goods. But imports of food and industrial supplies declined.
Goods exports rose 1.4% to $157.3 billion. There were increases in exports of consumer goods, industrial supplies and motor vehicles. Capital goods exports also rose, but food exports tumbled. 
The report was published ahead of Thursday's advance fourth-quarter GDP data. Trade has subtracted from GDP growth for five straight quarters. According to a Reuters survey of economists, the economy likely grew at a 5.5% annualized rate last quarter, an acceleration from the third quarter's 2.3% pace. 
Inventory investment likely accounted for much of the anticipated acceleration in GDP growth last quarter. Growth last year is expected to have been the strongest since 1984.
The Commerce Department report showed retail inventories shot up 4.4% in December after increasing 2.0% in November. Inventories of motor vehicles and parts jumped 6.8% after rising 4.3% in November. They had been hampered by a global semi-conductor shortage, which has undercut motor vehicle production.
Retail inventories excluding motor vehicles accelerated 3.6% after rising 1.2% in November. This component goes into the calculation of GDP growth. 
GROWTH ESTIMATES RAISED
Economists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) raised their fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 7.5% rate from a 7.0% pace. IHS Markit lifted its forecast 1.3 percentage points to a 7.4% rate. 
The data published on Wednesday is unadjusted for inflation, which presents a bit of uncertainty about the inventory investment estimate in Thursday's snapshot of fourth-quarter GDP.
""But the data in hand signal that the real inventory buildup in the fourth quarter was substantial,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. ""While inventories should be very supportive for GDP growth in the fourth quarter, we think this buildup presents a downside risk to our first quarter real GDP forecast of a 1.5% rate.""
Inventories at wholesalers increased 2.1% last month after advancing 1.7% in November. There were increases in stocks of both durable and nondurable goods.
Inventory accumulation had been constrained by COVID-19-related global shortages, and the solid increases over the last two months offer hope that the worst of the supply chain disruptions was behind.
""It will likely take time for the supply-chain issues to ease, which could keep U.S. goods inflation elevated,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
There was also some encouraging news on the housing market, with another report from the Commerce Department showing new home sales soaring 11.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 811,000 units in December, the highest level since March.

The outlook for the housing market is, however, uncertain amid expensive building materials, labor shortages and rising mortgage rates.
""Demand should remain strong, but supply is expected to increase only gradually and the runup in prices prior to December along with the more recent rise in mortgage rates will sideline many prospective buyers,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

Retail sales of new vehicles could fall 8.3% to 828,900 units from a year earlier, according to a report released by the consultants on Wednesday.
""The volume of new vehicles being delivered to dealerships in January has been insufficient to meet strong consumer demand, resulting in a significantly diminished sales pace,"" said Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Powers. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused bottlenecks in supply chains, driving up costs for everything from labor to raw materials.
The average new-vehicle retail transaction price in January is expected to reach $44,905, the previous high was in December 2021 at $45,283. 
U.S. business activity grew at its slowest pace in 18 months in January as a winter surge in COVID-19 infections worsened worker shortages at factories, though demand remained strong.
Total new-vehicle sales for January 2022, including retail and non-retail transactions, are projected to reach 932,099 units, a 15.6% decrease from last year.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate for total new-vehicle sales is expected to be 14.1 million units, down 2.6 million units from 2021.
Separately, research firm Cox Automotive said on Wednesday new-vehicle sales in January were expected to reach 1.01 million units, a drop of 8.9% compared to January 2021. 

Cox Automotive expects seasonally adjusted annual rate to finish near 15.3 million, up from 12.4 million in December, the slowest pace since May 2020.

New home sales increased 11.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 811,000 units last month, the highest level since March, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. November's sales pace was revised down to 725,000 units from the previously reported 744,000 units.
Sales soared in the densely populated South as well as in the Midwest. They also rose in the West, but tumbled in the Northeast.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for more than 10% of U.S. home sales, rising to a rate of 760,000 units. New home sales are a leading indicator of the housing market, but can be volatile on a monthly basis.
Sales dropped 14.0% on a year-on-year basis in December. They peaked at a rate of 993,000 units in January, which was the highest since the end of 2006. About 762,000 new homes were sold in 2021, down 7.3% from 2020.
The new housing market is being underpinned by a record-low inventory of previously owned homes. Demand for housing is expected to remain strong even as mortgage rates increase, which together with high prices will further erode affordability. 
The median new house price in December rose 3.4% from a year ago to $377,700. There were 403,000 new homes on the market, up from 397,000 units in November.
Houses under construction made up 65.3% of the inventory, with homes yet to be built accounting for about 25%.

The government last week reported the housing construction backlog surged to a record high in December while completions tumbled as well. Builders are being hamstrung by sky-high prices for building materials, a situation that could worsen after the government nearly doubled duties on imported Canadian softwood lumber last November.
At December's sales pace it would take 6.0 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 6.6 months in November.

The official rate of consumer price inflation hit 5.4% in December, its highest since March 1992, and the BoE is widely expected to raise rates on Feb. 3, which would be its second rate rise in less than two months.
Longer-term public inflation expectations for the next five to 10 years - which some economists think give a better guide on whether price pressures are becoming entrenched - held at 3.8%, their joint-highest level since 2013.

Gross domestic product (GDP) likely grew 3.8% in October-December versus a year earlier, the poll of 25 economists shows, after it rose 3.7% year-on-year in the third quarter.
But that would still lag the 7.43% growth in the second quarter and 8.92% in the first quarter.
Policymakers have said they expect full-year 2021 growth to slightly exceed 6%, which would be the fastest pace in over a decade, since a 10.25% expansion in 2010.

But domestic consumption was hit by a rare rise in community COVID-19 transmissions starting mid-May and imposition of strict restrictions on gatherings and other curbs. 
While that outbreak has now ended, the government is on alert for a smattering of local Omicron variant infections that began earlier in January, though curbs on people's activities have been limited so far.
Fitch Solutions last week noted retail sales growth between September and November, pointing to a recovery in consumer spending.
""However, the emergence of highly infectious variants, such as Omicron, and the implementation of strict COVID-19 measures are a downside risk to our outlook,"" it said.

The services producer price index rose 1.1% in December from a year earlier, marking the 10th straight month of increases, Bank of Japan data showed on Wednesday. The level of the index, at 106.0, was the highest since July 2001.
The increase was driven by rising transportation costs with ocean freight fees spiking 38.6% in December from a year ago, the data showed, underscoring the impact global supply chain disruptions are having on Japan's service costs.
In a sign the economy's re-opening from COVID-19 curbs propped up demand, advertisement fees were up 6.4% in December.
Japan has not been immune to global commodity inflation with wholesale prices spiking 8.5% in December from a year earlier, marking the second fastest pace on record.
But core consumer inflation stood at just 0.5% in December, well below the BOJ's 2% target, as weak consumption discourages firms from passing on higher costs to households.
Policymakers say stronger wage growth would be crucial for inflation to sustainably accelerate toward the BOJ's target.

Higher wages would put further upward pressure on services prices, though many analysts doubt companies will increase pay aggressively when rising raw material costs and a resurgence in COVID-19 cases cloud the outlook.

ELFA, which reports economic activity for the nearly $1-trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 78.6%, down from 77.2% in November.
The Washington-based body's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States.

The index is based on a survey of 25 members, including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), CIT Group (NYSE:CIT) Inc and financing affiliates or units of  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) Inc, Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY), Canon Inc and Volvo AB (OTC:VLVLY).
The Equipment Leasing & Finance Foundation, ELFA's non-profit affiliate, said its confidence index for January was at 63.9%, unchanged from December. A reading above 50 indicates a positive business outlook.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence ebbed slightly in January, with more consumers planning to purchase homes, automobiles and other big- ticket items even as they grew less optimistic about business and labor market conditions in the short term. 
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday also showed consumers' inflation expectations moderating for a second straight month, though still high. Labor market views softened a bit, likely reflecting the disruptions on businesses caused by the winter wave of COVID-19, fueled by the Omicron variant. 
""While consumer confidence dipped this month, consumers generally have faith in the strength of this recovery,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index slipped to a reading of 113.8 this month from 115.2 in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 111.8. Despite the first decline in four months, the index is well above pandemic lows.
The survey places more emphasis on the labor market, which is tightening amid worker shortages. The cutoff date for the survey was Jan. 19. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell moderately in mid-January. 
The Conference Board survey's measure of current conditions rose, a sign that the economy entered 2022 on strong footing. Its gauge of expectations for growth in the short term eased in line with views that Omicron will slow economic growth this quarter.

The United States is reporting an average of 696,541 new coronavirus infections a day, according to a Reuters analysis of official data. Infections, however, appear to be subsiding in some regions, including the hardest-hit New York.
Against the backdrop of a stock market rout, some economists viewed the decline in short-term expectations as a warning sign.
Wall Street has come under intense selling pressure as investors fear aggressive interest rates increases by the Federal Reserve to tame inflation, as well as a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
U.S. stocks were lower, with the S&P 500 index flirting with a correction for the second time this year. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
""We don't remember consumer confidence remaining high for long historically when Wall Street is in a tailspin, said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""Consumers already think business conditions will not be as positive six months from now before the stock market tumbled.""
INFLATION EXPECTATIONS EASE 
The Conference Board's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, fell to a still-high reading of 43.8 this month from 44.2 in December. 
This measure correlates to the unemployment rate from the Labor Department. There were 10.6 million jobs openings at the end of November. The unemployment rate is at a 22-month low of 3.9%.
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months slipped to 6.8% from 6.9% last month. The retreat in inflation expectations from a 13-year high of 7.3% last November is likely to be welcomed by Fed officials who started a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. The U.S. central bank is expected to start raising rates in March. 
Despite high inflation, more consumer expected to buy homes, cars and other big-ticket items over the next six months. 
The share of consumers planning to buy a motor vehicle was the largest in six months. Buying intentions for household appliances like television sets and refrigerators also rose, but plans to purchase washing machines and clothes dryers fell.
Consumers were more keen to buy a house over the next six months, with the share the largest in the current series. There was a break in the series in November 2010. 
With housing supply continuing to lag demand, that suggests home prices will likely remain elevated this year. A second report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller's 20 metropolitan area home price index rose 18.3% on a year-on-year basis in November after accelerating 18.5% in October.
(Graphic: Case Shiller, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/lgvdwjrjkpo/caseshiller.png) 
More than half of the 20 markets, including Florida as well as other metropolitan areas in the Southeast and Southwest regions reported strong price growth in November.
""Additionally, higher-tier price ranges have remained relatively more resistant to economic forces, mortgage rates and COVID-19-related demand changes and continue to be magnet markets for many buyers,"" said Selma Hepp, deputy chief economist at CoreLogic. ""Given that these areas have also had the relatively largest gains in in-migration, pressure on prices has persisted and will likely remain over the coming year.""
A survey from real estate brokerage  Redfin  (NASDAQ:RDFN).com showed 31.2% of the platform's users looked to move to a different metropolitan area in the fourth quarter. The popular destinations were Miami, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Sacramento and Tampa, viewed as affordable areas.

Strong house price inflation was mirrored by a fourth report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency showing house prices increased 17.5% in the 12 months through November after rising 17.4% in October. 
There was big annual price growth in the Mountain, West South Central, East South Central and South Atlantic states.

LONDON (Reuters) -British manufacturers expect to raise prices by the most since 1977 over the next three months, as they wrestle with serious labour shortages and the biggest increase in costs since 1980, a quarterly survey showed on Tuesday.
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) data look set to reinforce the Bank of England's fears that high inflation is getting baked into businesses' pricing plans, bolstering the chances it will hike interest rates again next week.
The CBI survey showed a rise in factory orders, greater investment and the strongest export demand growth since July 2018, but overall optimism fell as businesses struggled with sharply rising costs for raw materials and some workers.
""Global supply chain challenges are continuing to impact UK firms, with our survey showing intense and escalating cost and price pressures,"" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.
British consumer price inflation hit its highest in almost 30 years in December at 5.4%, though there had been some signs in other surveys that the pace of cost growth for businesses was beginning to slow.
Previously released data showed annual producer price inflation slowed in December for the first time since May 2020 and input costs fell on the month for the first time since August 2020. January's IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index showed the smallest factory input costs rise since April 2021.
BACK TO THE 1970S?
However, Tuesday's CBI survey showed that the proportion of manufacturers expecting domestic prices to rise over the next three months was its highest since April 1977. The export prices expectations balance was the highest since January 1980.
Costs for manufacturers in the three months to January rose by the most since April 1980, and the percentage of firms reporting limited capacity due to a lack of skilled workers was the highest since October 1973 at 42%.
Central bankers have generally rejected comparisons with the wage-price spirals that plagued most Western economies in the 1970s, but last week one BoE official said it was possible there was a shift away from the more benign patterns of the 2010s.
Manufacturers' optimism about the current business situation and prospects for the year ahead both fell to their lowest since January 2021, when the economy was still in lockdown.

However, new orders picked up over the past three months and January's monthly gauge of new orders held unchanged at +24, just below November's record reading of +26. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a drop to +22.
Investment plans also strengthened, with plant and machinery investment intentions at their highest since April 1988 - possibly reflecting temporary tax incentives for this type of investment as well as strong underlying demand.

The seasonally adjusted growth reported by national statistics agency INEGI was marginally higher than the figure of 0.2% forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts, and compared to a month-on-month contraction of 0.2% in October.
Meanwhile, preliminary data for December showed the economy had slipped by 0.2% https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-economy-slips-december-hinting-weak-close-2021-2022-01-18 compared to the same month a year earlier.

Mexican gross domestic product (GDP) contracted in the third quarter of 2021. Two consecutive quarters of negative growth would mean the country had entered a technical recession.

BERLIN (Reuters) -German business morale improved in January for the first time in seven months as easing supply bottlenecks brightened the outlook for manufacturers in Europe's largest economy, promising a strong recovery from the coronavirus pandemic in spring.
The Ifo institute said on Tuesday its business climate index rose to 95.7 from an upwardly revised 94.8 in December. A Reuters poll of analysts had pointed to a January reading of 94.7.
""The German economy is starting the new year with a glimmer of hope,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said.
Company executives were considerably more upbeat about their business outlook while their assessment of the current situation was a bit less optimistic, Fuest added.
In manufacturing, supply bottlenecks in intermediate products and raw materials eased a little which helped to lift both assessments of the current business situation and business expectations for the next six months, Ifo said.
Business morale also improved in the services sector with the tourism industry looking forward to a promising summer holiday season, the survey showed.
Still, service providers were less satisfied with their current situation due to COVID-19 restrictions for unvaccinated citizens who still account for roughly a quarter of the German population.
INFLATION
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters the improvement in business sentiment was encouraging, but it was still too early to talk about an economic turnaround.
Wohlrabe also warned that inflation was unlikely to ease in coming months as every second company across industry, trade and retail suggested in the survey it was planning further price increases.
The Ifo figures chimed with Markit's purchasing manager index https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/easing-supply-shortages-sustains-german-manufacturing-recovery-pmi-2022-01-24 (PMI) from Monday that also showed a relaxation in supply chains which helped push up activity in the manufacturing sector to a five-month high in January.
""The German economy seems to be coming out of the winter slump,"" VP Bank analyst Thomas Gitzel said.
Gitzel cautioned, however, an escalation in the conflict with Russia over Ukraine could weigh on German business morale.
The DIHK Chamber of Industry and Commerce https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/german-firms-fear-supply-chain-pain-chinas-battle-with-omicron-2022-01-25 also pointed to the risk that the Omicron coronavirus variant could trigger more strict lockdown measures in China and result in more supply bottlenecks.

Most analysts expect the economy to stagnate or even shrink in the first three months of the year, following a drop of up to 1.0% in the final three months of 2021, according to a preliminary estimate of the federal statistics office.
The German cabinet is expected to approve its annual economic report https://www.reuters.com/article/germany-economy-gdp-idUSKBN2JV1IY on Wednesday in which Berlin will cut its GDP growth forecast for this year to 3.6% from its October estimate of 4.1%, according to a draft seen by Reuters on Friday.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's government looks firmly on track to borrow less this tax year than forecast but surging inflation will soon curb any leeway for finance minister Rishi Sunak who is under pressure to ease a cost-of-living squeeze.
Borrowing for the 2021/22 financial year so far - April to December - is so far running almost 13 billion pounds below the forecasts used by Sunak in his budget planning at 146.8 billion pounds, official date showed.
While on the face of it that presents Sunak with room for manoeuvre ahead of his March 23 budget update, the figures also showed rising costs from a surge in inflation.
Debt interest payments hit 8.1 billion pounds last month - the second highest on record and reflecting a jump in retail price inflation, the peg for inflation-linked British government bonds which account for about a third of the total.
""Surging inflation is making (Sunak's) task of returning the public finances to a sustainable footing much more difficult,"" Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said.
Retail price inflation hit a 30-year high of 7.5% in December, according to data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) last week.
The Resolution Foundation think tank said Sunak should use the leeway he has now to address the growing strain on household budgets from surging energy bills.
In response to Tuesday's data, Sunak stressed the importance of bringing down the deficit as interest costs rise.
""Risks to the public finances, including from inflation, make it even more important that we avoid burdening future generations with high debt repayments,"" he said.
Sunak is under pressure, including from some lawmakers in his own Conservative Party, to drop a planned increase in social security contributions for workers and employers - known as National Insurance - which is due to start in April.
The opposition Labour Party has pointed to mismanagement of government spending during the pandemic.
Public sector net borrowing, excluding state banks, totalled 16.848 billion pounds ($22.71 billion) in December alone, the ONS said, less than the average forecast of 18.5 billion pounds in a Reuters poll of economists.
Borrowing figures for the 2021/22 financial year so far included a 6 billion-pound downward revision to borrowing up until November, the ONS said.
The data showed a strong recovery in tax receipts.

Corporate tax revenues hit a all-time high of 5.5 billion pounds in December, the ONS said - with the caveats that it reflected large companies paying tax bills on a quarterly basis, and that the record is in current prices.

536,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 03:50AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's fiscal revenues rose 10.7% in 2021 from a year earlier, bolstered by last year's economic recovery, Vice Finance Minister Xu Hongcai said on Tuesday, as the government makes 2022 budget plans.
Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 8.1% in 2021, the fastest in a decade due partly to the low base from 2020 when COVID-19 jolted the economy, comfortably beating an official target of ""above 6%"".
""Steady GDP growth laid a good foundation for fiscal revenue growth,"" Xu told a news conference.
2021 revenues totalled 20.25 trillion yuan ($3.20 trillion), trailing expenditures of 24.63 trillion yuan, which grew 0.3%, Xu said.
China cut taxes and fees by over 1 trillion yuan last year, Xu said. 
The government is making its 2022 budget plans by analyzing the economic situation and many uncertain factors, Xu said without elaborating, though there are concerns over a recent rise in COVID-19 infections.
China will reasonably set the annual quota on local government bonds this year to boost infrastructure investment, focusing on projects under construction and major projects, while preventing debt risks, Xu said.
The finance ministry has issued 1.46 trillion yuan in the 2022 advance quota for local special bonds.
The government will unveil greater tax and fee cuts in 2022 in response to the downward pressure on the economy, Xu said.
The central government will boost its transfer payments to local governments to help ease their fiscal strains and deliver the planned tax and fee cuts, he said.
China will be able to achieve economic growth of around 5.5% in 2022, an adviser to the government's cabinet said last week, though some independent analysts became less optimistic after recent data pointed to slowing momentum.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's economy expanded at the fastest pace in 11 years in 2021 helped by a jump in exports and construction activity, tempering declines in capital investment and a slow recovery in the coronavirus-hit service sectors.
Record exports drove the rebound but swathes of the economy have fallen behind. Jobs are still vanishing across manufacturing and service sectors, a reminder that liberal President Moon Jae-in's promises to boost employment have not materialised. 
Hours after Bank of Korea data showed the economy expanded 4.0% last year, hundreds of small business owners plan to gather near the National Assembly in Seoul to shave their heads in protest against social distancing rules that have hammered retail and service sector sales. 
Sentiment remains pessimistic as South Koreans head to the polls for the 2022 Presidential election slated for March 9. 
The main candidates from the ruling and opposition parties have seized on the discontent, making an equitable society a centerpiece of their policy visions. 
The BOK expects GDP to grow 3.0% this year as Asia's fourth-largest economy benefits from strength in semiconductor exports and increased public spending, though record domestic COVID-19 cases this week are a threat to consumption.
""Global demand for our chips is resilient and strong exports will keep (South Korea's) growth momentum solid,"" said Hwang Sang-pil, head of BOK's Economics Statistics department. 
""People are getting used to social distancing curbs. Activity was slower in December but the hit is smaller than before.""
The economy expanded a seasonally adjusted 1.1% in the October-December period from three months earlier, beating the 0.9% expansion tipped in a Reuters poll and up from a 0.3% rise in the third quarter.
From a year earlier, the economy expanded 4.1% in the fourth quarter, also beating a median forecast of 3.7% in the poll.
The BOK on Jan. 14 raised its benchmark interest rate to pre-pandemic levels and signalled it may tighten further as growth and inflationary pressures remain strong.
South Korea's economy has had a sharp albeit uneven bounce from the coronavirus slump in 2020, when it contracted 0.9%, with exports expanding at their fastest annual pace in 11 years last year while the consumption recovery has been patchy due to social distancing curbs.
A recent Reuters poll of 20 economists forecast the economy will grow 2.9% this year, below the 3.0% projected by the BOK.
Tuesday's data showed exports were the main driver of growth in the fourth quarter, jumping 4.3% on-quarter.
Growth was also helped by private consumption and construction investment, which expanded 1.7% and 2.9%, respectively.

The service sector grew 1.3% in the fourth quarter, stronger than the third quarter but slower than the second.
Capital investment declined 0.6% on-quarter, following a 2.4% drop in the preceding three months.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's core inflation flew to its fastest annual pace since 2014 in the December quarter as fuel and housing costs led broad-based price pressures, a shock that will stoke market speculation of an early hike in interest rates.
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Tuesday showed the headline consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.3% in the fourth quarter and 3.5% for the year, topping forecasts.
The trimmed mean measure of core inflation favoured by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) jumped 1.0% in the quarter, the largest increase since 2008.
The annual pace picked up to 2.6%, above both the 2.3% forecast and the middle of the RBA's 2% to 3% target range.
That will be a surprise to the RBA, which had expected core inflation would not reach 2.5% until the end of 2023, a major reason it did not expect to hike rates this year.
That outlook will now be sorely challenged when the RBA Board meets on Feb.1. Analysts generally assume it will keep rates at 0.1% but could well call an end to bond buying, part of its quantitative easing campaign.
""The RBA is all but certain to end its asset purchase scheme at its meeting next week,"" said Ben Udy, an economist at Capital Economics. ""Our expectation for wage growth to firm up over the course of this year means the Bank should have enough evidence to hike rates by November.""
The rising cost of living, coupled with sky-high housing prices, is also shaping up to be a bone of political contention in a national election due by May.
The ABS noted a boom in home building combined with shortages of materials and labour to drive the largest increase in new dwelling prices in two decades.
Tuesday's data emboldened markets, which have long wagered the RBA was behind the curve on inflation and would have to tighten early, perhaps even by May this year.
A rise to 0.25% is fully priced in by June along with three more moves to 1.0% by year end.
WATCHING WAGES 
The RBA had argued that inflation was not yet a problem for Australia, still being less than half the levels seen in the United States or UK. 
Surging prices for energy and used cars have been a major contributor to U.S. inflation, but electricity costs have actually been falling in Australia while the ABS does not include used cars in its CPI.
Wages have also been more restrained in Australia with annual growth running at just 2.2%, less than half the pace of the U.S. and UK.
Still, unemployment has fallen much more quickly than expected to reach its lowest since 2008 at 4.2%, near lows that have lifted wages in the past.
A recent explosion of coronavirus cases has complicated the picture, throttling consumer spending but also causing supply bottlenecks that could add to inflationary pressures.

A survey of businesses from NAB on Tuesday showed confidence crumbled in December, even as sales held up reasonably well, while costs were rising at the fastest pace in years.
""With significant disruption to supply chains and labour markets, price pressures are to be expected and the key question will be how quickly, if at all, these pressures abate over coming months,"" said NAB chief economist Alan Oster. 
 
"
539,"<span>Jan 24, 2022 07:40PM ET</span>",,,,,,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - A measure of Australian business confidence has swung into the red as a surge in coronavirus cases hit consumer spending and played havoc with staffing, though sales overall were proving resilient so far.
Tuesday's survey from National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) (NAB) showed its index of business confidence slid 24 points to -12 in December, below the trough during the Delta wave last year.
Business conditions eased a more modest 3 points to +8, as sales held firm at +14 and profitability actually edged up a point to +10. The drag came from its measure of employment, which dropped 9 points to +2.
""It fell despite strong jobs growth reported in official data, reflecting the complexity of the labour market situation as businesses faced growing worker shortages and the prospect of a 'shadow lockdown' through the summer,"" said NAB chief economist Alan Oster.
There were more signs of inflation in the survey as purchase costs jumped to 2.8% in quarterly terms, the highest since 2008, while growth in final product prices firmed to 1.5% and retail prices advanced 2% in quarterly terms.

Official data out on Tuesday is expected to show core inflation rose at its fastest annual pace since 2014 in the December quarter, adding to speculation the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) might hike interest rates as early as May.
""With significant disruption to supply chains and labour markets, price pressures are to be expected and the key question will be how quickly, if at all, these pressures abate over coming months,"" said Oster.

Data firm IHS Markit said on Monday its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to a reading of 50.8 this month from 57.0 in December. That was the lowest level since July 2020. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the private sector.
The flash composite orders index slipped to a still-high reading of 55.0 from 56.6 in December.
""Output has been affected by Omicron much more than demand, with robust growth of new business inflows hinting that growth will pick up again once restrictions are relaxed,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. 
The United States is reporting an average of 738,047 new coronavirus infections a day, according to a Reuters analysis of official data. Infections are mostly driven by the highly contagious Omicron variant. 
Government data this week showed 8.8 million people reporting not being at work because of coronavirus-related reasons between Dec. 29 and Jan. 10. There has also been an increase in businesses saying they suffered large impacts from the pandemic. 
That has lifted first-time applications for unemployment benefits to a three-month high. But there are signs that the Omicron wave is cresting, which could see business activity picking up. 
The slowdown in activity this month was across the board. 
The IHS Markit survey's flash services sector PMI dropped to a reading of 50.9, also the lowest since July 2020, from 57.6 in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 55.0 this month for the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
Services industry businesses reported that labor shortages, employee absences and Omicron held back growth. Still, demand for services remained strong and companies managed to hire more workers, reducing the backlog of unfinished work. 
Price growth for inputs at services businesses slowed somewhat, though the pace remained very strong. This supports views that inflation has or is close to peaking. 
Worsening supply chain problems because of Omicron restrained manufacturing activity this month. The survey's flash manufacturing PMI fell to a 15-month low of 55.0 from 57.7 in December. Economists had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, dipping to 56.7. 

The survey's measure of manufacturing employment contracted for the first time in 18 months, with IHS Markit noting ""a high turnover of staff and reports of the non-replacement of voluntary leavers.""
Orders for factory goods increased at their slowest rate since July 2020. Manufacturers also reported that the cost of inputs had eased a bit though prices still remained very high.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro zone economic recovery weakened this month, despite an upturn in Germany where factories benefited from an easing in supply chain bottlenecks, as renewed restrictions put a dent in the bloc's dominant services industry, a survey showed.
With the Omicron coronavirus variant sweeping across Europe governments have been encouraging citizens to stay home and avoid socialising while soaring prices have discouraged consumers from spending.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as good gauge of overall economic health, dropped to 52.4 in January from 53.3 in December, its lowest since February and below the 52.6 predicted in a Reuters poll.
That headline number was affected by the services PMI, which dropped to a nine-month low, although it remained in growth territory.
With customers staying home, growth in demand for services almost dried up. The new business index sank to its lowest reading since April last year just before parts of the economy reopened after a stricter lockdown.
""The small decline in the flash Composite PMI in January shows that Omicron has taken a toll on the services sector, although the German economy performed surprisingly well,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
Businesses in Germany, Europe's largest economy, expanded at their fastest pace in four months, earlier data showed, as factories enjoyed an easing in supply chain bottlenecks. 
But in France, the only other euro zone country to report preliminary numbers, business growth dipped more than forecast as the impact of COVID-19 and inflationary pressures weighed on activity.
That suggests the bloc would have stumbled further without Germany's strength.
In Britain, outside the euro zone and the European Union, activity cooled unexpectedly to an 11-month low but cost pressures stayed high, leaving the Bank of England on track to raise interest rates next week.
Further afield, factory activity in Japan grew at the fastest pace in four years although activity in the private sector as a whole slipped into contraction for the first time in four months as the services industry suffered amid a surge in coronavirus cases.
PRICE PRESSURES
Consumers were also hit by rocketing prices. The euro zone composite output prices index matched November's survey high, and comes after inflation hit a record last month, likely adding pressure on the European Central Bank to tighten policy.
Factories, however, are less affected by restrictions and have largely remained open. The bloc's manufacturing PMI rose to a five-month high of 59.0 from 58.0, well ahead of the 57.5 Reuters poll estimate.
An index measuring output jumped to 55.8 from 53.8. The output measure feeds into the composite PMI and its big increase shows how much impact the services decline had on overall activity.
""The major news out of the release is that manufacturers are again noticing some abatement in supply chain problems. After cautious signs of improvements in December, things have materially improved in January,"" Colijn said.
To meet buoyant demand factories increased headcount at a rapid pace. The employment index soared to 57.5 from 55.3, its highest since July.
A Reuters poll last week found more than two-thirds of economists saying the Omicron variant would have a milder economic impact than Delta, and with the vaccine programme in the region continuing, optimism improved.
The composite future output index nudged up to its highest since the Omicron wave began.

""With the number of new COVID-19 cases having peaked in some countries and some governments having already outlined plans to ease restrictions, euro zone economic activity should pick up a bit in February and March,"" said Andrew Kenningham at Capital Economics.

LONDON (Reuters) - British business activity cooled unexpectedly this month to an 11-month low but cost pressures stayed high, according to a survey that leaves the Bank of England on track to raise interest rates next week.
The IHS Markit/CIPS Composite Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) slipped in January to 53.4 from 53.6. While remaining above the 50 dividing line between growth and contraction, a Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 55.0.
The spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus again hit consumer-facing companies and manufacturers said orders grew at the weakest pace for a year - although business and financial services companies saw a quicker rate of expansion.
The flash PMIs suggested a similar level of economic performance for Britain, Germany and France, the three largest European economies.
""All told, this PMI survey suggests that the (UK) economy is suffering a hangover from the surge in Omicron cases. Even so, we still think GDP will recover fairly swiftly over the rest of Q1,"" said Adam Hoyes, economist from consultancy Capital Economics.
Sterling and British government bond prices showed no reaction to the data.
Gauges of costs paid and prices charged by services companies - watched closely by the BoE - increased in January, after easing back in December from recent all-time highs.
""With inflationary pressures remaining elevated at near-record levels, this all adds to the likelihood of the Bank of England hiking interest rates again at its upcoming meeting,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said.

British consumer price inflation hit a nearly 30-year high of 5.4% in the 12 months to December and many economists think it will go higher than the BoE's most recent estimate of a peak of around 6% in April.
The PMI for the services sector fell in January to 53.3 from 53.6 in December - its lowest level since February last year.
While the manufacturing PMI slipped to 56.9 from 57.9 in December, the decline reflected the way the survey measures supply chain delays, which eased further last month. 
""There have been signs that some stubborn supply chain pressures have started to ease,"" Rhys Herbert, senior economist at Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank, said. 

""However, the energy crisis and reports of new checks causing delays at ports are challenging many firms in the sector,"" he said, referring to the latest customs rules introduced on trade between Britain and the European Union.
Unlike in the much larger services sector, price pressures in manufacturing cooled in January.

IHS Markit's flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) showed that activity in the manufacturing sector rose to 60.5 from 57.4 in December.
Activity in the services sector rose to a two-month high of 52.2 after shrinking in December, confounding a forecast that had pointed to a decline and pointing to a positive mood among consumers and business despite the impact of the Omicron coronavirus variant.
As a result, the flash composite PMI, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the German economy, rose to a four-month high reading of 54.3 from 49.9 the previous month.
The results showcased the resilience of the German economy whose recovery from the pandemic was held back last year by supply shortages and fears that the Omicron variant could result in crippling lockdowns.

""Manufacturing is expected to stage a recovery in 2022 as supply bottlenecks ease, but seeing growth of this speed already is a welcome development,"" said Phil Smith, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit.
""All in all, the data mark a positive start to the year and go some way to allaying fears about Omicron's impact on the German economy in the first quarter,"" he added. ""Still, rising costs remain a concern for businesses, with the survey data showing that input prices are continuing to rise sharply and on multiple fronts.""

Data compiler IHS Markit said its flash purchasing managers' index (PMI) for France's dominant services sector fell to 53.1 points in January from 57.0 in December - below a forecast for a January reading of 55.3 points.
The reading for the services sector, however, remained above the 50-point threshold which marks an expansion in activity.
The January flash PMI reading for French manufacturing dipped to 55.5 points from 55.6, albeit in line with forecasts.
The January composite flash PMI, which includes both the services and manufacturing sectors, fell to 52.7 points from 55.8 in December - coming below a forecast for 54.5 points.
IHS Markit said the figures highlighted the hits to business caused by the fifth wave of the COVID virus currently hitting the country, and inflationary pressures caused by rising energy prices.

""Given the surging number of daily COVID-19 cases we've seen in France, it's no surprise to see softer PMI numbers in January,"" said IHS Markit senior economist Joe Hayes.
""Supply chain issues continue to impact the economy, particularly manufacturers, but we do appear to have seen the worst as delivery times lengthened to a far weaker extent than seen during much of 2021. That being said, the inflationary side effects remain in play and are being exacerbated by rising staff costs and energy prices,"" added Hayes.

The IHS Markit Flash Australia Composite Output Index tumbled to 45.3 in January from 54.9 in December, bringing to an end three consecutive months of expansion. Business confidence fell to the lowest level since April 2020.
“The Australian economy had slipped from a state of strong recovery in end-2021 to being affected by the surge in Covid-19 infections,” said Jingyi Pan, economics associate director at IHS Markit. “Supply issues meanwhile remained prevalent, with lengthening of lead times, reports of supply shortages and labor constraints persisting.”
The result highlights the impact of an omicron outbreak that erupted just as Australia moved to trying to live with Covid, throwing up a hurdle to the $1.5 trillion economy’s recovery. The consensus view is there’s likely to be a mild slowdown in growth in the first quarter of this year, followed by a rebound as cases subside, underpinned by strong demand from cashed-up households. 
Today’s report also showed input-price inflation accelerated to a record due to worsening supply-chain snarls. 
The price pressure is significant for Australian policy makers who have been trying to revive inflation that in recent years has barely reached the lower end of the Reserve Bank’s 2-3% target. If supply-chain disruptions and a labor squeeze persist, the RBA could be forced to tighten policy earlier than its current indication of late 2023.
Australia reports inflation data for the final three months of 2021 on Tuesday and the RBA board meets a week later, with policy makers due to decide the fate of a bond-buying program.

BERLIN (Reuters) -The German government will cut its economic growth forecast for this year to 3.6% from its October estimate of 4.1%, according to a draft of the annual economic report seen by Reuters on Friday. 
The coalition government of Social Democrats, Greens and Liberals, in power since December, expects the pandemic to further strain businesses and supply bottlenecks for products such as semiconductors to persist, further limiting companies' growth, according to the draft. 
Magazine Der Spiegel was first to report the new growth forecast.
The new government predicts inflation to reach 3.3% on average this year, after it soared to 3.1% in 2021 from 0.5% a year earlier and is still forecasting core inflation, excluding food and energy prices, to run at 2.5% in 2022, the draft said.

Most economists expect Europe's largest economy to shrink again in the first three months of 2022 after a fourth-quarter contraction, driving it into another technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of declining output.
Germany's BDI industry association said earlier this month it expected the nation's economy to grow 3.5% this year, showing more caution than the government as it warned that companies could face another year of ""stop-and-go"" business due to the pandemic.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian retail sales most likely fell by 2.1% in December as authorities imposed restrictions to fight the Omicron variant of the coronavirus and retailers faced challenges, Statistics Canada predicted on Friday.
Statscan also said retail sales rose 0.7% in November, which was less than the 1.2% gain forecast by analysts.
The flash estimate for December was based on responses from 50.6% of companies surveyed. The average response rate is 90.0%.
Statscan also said some shoppers decided to pull forward their purchases to November to avoid shortages caused by endemic supply chain issues.
Andrew Grantham, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the December dip was a little larger than he had expected.
""Bricks-and-mortar retailers will have likely continued to struggle in January due to Omicron-related restrictions and staff shortages,"" he said in a note.
This weakness, he suggested, might ""tip the scales slightly"" in terms of persuading the Bank of Canada to hold steady when it makes a rate announcement on Jan 26. Money markets see about a 70% chance that the central bank will lift its key overnight rate from the current record low 0.25%. {BOCWATCH]
The bank has previously said it could raise rates as early as soon as April.
Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics, said the December decrease in sales was likely to be more than 2.1%, given the rapid spread of Omicron that month.
November's gain was fueled by higher sales at gasoline stations, and at building materials and gardening equipment and supplies dealers.

Sales rose in six of 11 subsectors, representing 63.8% of retail trade. In volume terms, retail sales edged up 0.2%.
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.1% lower at 1.2520 to the greenback, or 79.87 U.S. cents.

LONDON (Reuters) -British retail sales slumped in December after consumers did much of their Christmas shopping earlier than usual in November and many people stayed at home due to the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant.
Economists said the scale of the hit bolstered their expectations that the world's fifth-biggest economy shrank last month under the strain of Omicron and new government restrictions to slow its spread. 
Sales volumes fell by 3.7% from November, a far bigger hit than the 0.6% decline forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and the biggest fall since January of last year when the country was under a coronavirus lockdown.
Compared with December 2020, sales volumes were down by 0.9%, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Friday.
The Reuters poll had pointed to a 3.4% rise in sales in annual terms.
""After strong pre-Christmas trading in November, retail sales fell across the board in December, with feedback from retailers suggesting Omicron impacted on footfall,"" ONS Deputy Director for Surveys Heather Bovill said.
""As Plan B restrictions in England meant more people working from home, there was a notable fall for fuel sales,"" she added, referring to government measures to tackle the pandemic.
But retail sales remained stronger than before the pandemic, with over a quarter of sales now made online, she said.
Bethany Beckett, an economist at Capital Economics, said the data backed her view that the surge in Omicron cases in the run-up to Christmas may have caused the economy to shrink by 0.5% in December or possibly more.
Retail sales would probably recoup the hit between January and March as the government lifts its COVID restrictions but ""with the UK’s cost of living crisis looming, we expect a weakening in the consumer recovery to dampen retail sales further ahead,"" she said.
However, the Bank of England was still likely to raise interest rates for a second time in two months in February, Beckett said.
British consumer price inflation hit a nearly 30-year high of 5.4% in the 12 months to December. Average earnings in the three months to November, excluding bonuses, rose by 3.8% compared with the same period of 2020.
A survey published earlier on Friday showed consumer confidence fell in January to its lowest since February 2021 when the country was under lockdown.
The ONS data showed non-food sales slumped by 7.1% in December from November, also the biggest fall since January last year.

British retail sales recovered quickly from their 2020 pandemic slump when restrictions were first lifted.
But the rise in inflation led by surging energy prices, the prospect of higher interest rates and a tax hike in April will test the appetite of consumers to keep on spending in 2022, retail executives have warned.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices rose 0.5% in December from a year earlier, increasing for a second month in a row at the fastest pace in nearly two years in a sign of broadening inflationary pressure from rising fuel and raw material costs.
The recent inflation pick-up drew the attention of Bank of Japan (BOJ) policymakers, some of whom said firms might be starting to be more aggressive in passing on higher costs to consumers, minutes of their December interest rate-setting meeting showed on Friday.
""It's unlikely Japan will see wages rise as sharply as in the United States. But there's a significant chance both economic growth and inflation could overshoot expectations,"" one BOJ board member was quoted as saying in the meeting.
The rise in the core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food but includes energy costs, was slightly below market forecasts for a 0.6% gain. It was in line with a 0.5% increase in November, which was the fastest gain since February 2020, government data showed on Friday.
Still, the increase is not likely to trigger an immediate withdrawal of monetary stimulus by the BOJ, with inflation still well below its 2% target and driven mostly by external factors rather than strong domestic demand.
But the central bank will face the challenge of taming market speculation of an early exit from ultra-easy policy, as some analysts expect consumer inflation to approach 2% when drag from cellphone fee cuts ends in April.
Creeping inflation may also hurt consumption at a time when a surge in cases of the Omicron new coronavirus variant and more people staying at home to stay safe cloud the outlook of Japan's fragile economic recovery.
Electricity bills surged 13.4% in December from a year earlier, the fastest pace since 1981, on top of a 22.4% spike in gasoline costs, the CPI data showed.
""We're seeing signs of change in the price-setting behaviour of Japanese firms, which had been said to be cautious about raising prices for fear of seeing sales volume fall,"" the BOJ minutes quoted a board member as saying at the December meeting.
Japan has not been immune to the impact of global commodity inflation with wholesale prices rising at a record pace, prodding more firms to raise prices and already shifting public perception that deflation will persist.
The BOJ raised its price forecasts on Tuesday but said it was in no rush to change its ultra-loose policy on the view the recent cost-push inflation will provide transitory.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said the bank's focus would be to scrutinise whether wages will rise enough to increase households' purchasing power, allow firms to hike prices and help sustainably accelerate inflation.
There is uncertainty, however, on whether companies will heed requests by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to raise wages as stubbornly high input costs squeeze their profit.
Some analysts remain doubtful on whether inflation will broaden beyond goods sensitive to fuel and commodity prices.

An index stripping away the effect of energy and volatile fresh food prices fell 0.7% in December from a year earlier, dropping for the ninth consecutive month, the CPI data showed.
""There are goods for which prices can be raised with relative ease, such as fuel and energy. But for other products it's difficult,"" said Taro Saito, executive research fellow at NLI Research Institute. ""I don't think there will as much price growth as in the United States and Europe.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits jumped to a three-month high last week, likely as a winter wave of COVID-19 infections disrupted business activity, which could constrain job growth this month.
The third straight weekly increase in jobless claims reported by the Labor Department on Thursday was also influenced by unfavorable seasonal factors after the holidays. Coronavirus cases, driven by the Omicron variant, are subsiding and the seasonal factors, the model used by the government to iron out seasonal fluctuations from data, are seen normalizing soon, suggesting the recent surge in claims is a blip.
""The Omicron variant of COVID-19 is hurting the U.S. labor market, but the good news is that this will be temporary,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits surged 55,000 to a seasonally adjusted 286,000 for the week ended Jan. 15, the highest level since mid-October. The increase was the largest since last July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 220,000 applications for the latest week.
Unadjusted claims fell 83,418 to 337,417 last week. The decline was, however, less than the 138,773 decrease that had been anticipated by the seasonal factors. 
Claims rose 6,075 in California. But they plunged 14,011 in New York. There were also big drops in Missouri and Texas.
The United States is reporting an average of 752,698 new coronavirus infections a day, according to a Reuters analysis of official data. 
Latest data from the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey showed more than 8 million people reported not being at work because of coronavirus-related reasons between Dec. 29 and Jan. 10. That was up from the 3 million from Dec. 1 to Dec. 13.
With signs that the Omicron wave has crested in some regions, including hard-hit New York, the setback to the labor market is unlikely to stop the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates in March to tackle high inflation.
Claims have plunged from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020. Employers are desperate for workers, with 10.6 million job openings at the end of November. The unemployment rate is at a 22-month low of 3.9%, a sign the labor market is at or close to maximum employment.
""The underlying strength in the labor market suggests this is a temporary blip due to Omicron,"" said John Lynch, chief investment officer at Comerica (NYSE:CMA) Wealth Management in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""We look for job growth to continue to firm as global cyclical recovery persists.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
BAD OMEN?
But some economists worried that the jump in claims, which followed a plunge in retail sales in December as well as manufacturing production, could be signaling a faster slowdown in economic activity than currently anticipated. 
""The higher layoffs are a cautionary tale for the economy where despite inflation pressures, the Fed will have to proceed with their interest rate hikes at a measured pace,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""The economy may be slowing down more than previously believed.""
There are, however, indications that manufacturing is picking up, though shortages and higher prices remain a headache. 
The Philadelphia Fed said on Thursday its business activity index rose to a reading of 23.2 in January from 15.4 in December. Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing sector, which covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.
News on the housing market was discouraging. A report from the National Association of Realtors showed existing home sales dropped 4.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.18 million units in December as higher prices amid record low inventory continued to shut out some first-time buyers.
Economists expect demand for housing to remain strong even as mortgage rates increase.
""Unless job and income growth slow sharply, owner-occupied housing demand is likely to remain solid, keeping upward pressure on house prices,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.
Worker shortages are boosting wages and households are sitting on a pile of savings accumulated during the pandemic.
The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed businesses for the nonfarm payrolls component of January's employment report. 
Claims are significantly higher than their level in mid-December, suggesting moderate job growth this month. 
The economy added 199,000 jobs in December, the fewest in a year. The workforce is about 2.2 million people smaller than before the pandemic.
The recent softening in the labor market trend was also highlighted by the claims report, which showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 84,000 to 1.635 million in the week ended Jan. 8. 

Still, these so-called continuing claims stayed below 2 million for the eighth straight week.
""The pandemic continues to displace workers from the labor force,"" said Van Hesser, chief strategist at Kroll Bond Rating Agency in new York. ""We need the labor force to grow to sustain healthy economic growth.""

Existing home sales dropped 4.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.18 million units last month, the National Association of Realtors said on Thursday. Sales fell across all regions. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales would fall to a rate of 6.44 million units. 
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, declined 7.1% on a year-on-year basis. A total of 6.12 million homes were sold in 2021, the most since 2006. That was up 8.5% from 2020. Sales remained concentrated in the upper price-end of the market.
Demand for housing is being fueled by individuals as well as investors who renovate and then resell homes to take advantage of the hot housing market. But rising mortgage rates, supply constraints and higher house prices could make home purchases less affordable this year. 
There is a record backlog of houses authorized for construction but not yet started, according to government data published on Wednesday. Builders said this week that higher material costs and shortages were adding weeks to typical single-family construction times. 
The U.S. government in November nearly doubled the duties on imported Canadian softwood lumber to 17.9% from 9% after a review of its anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders.
The median existing house price increased 15.8% from a year earlier to $358,000 in December. House prices averaged a record $346,900 in 2021, up 16.9% from the prior year.
There were a record low of 910,000 previously owned homes on the market last month, down 18.0% from November and 14.2% from a year ago. At December's sales pace, it would take 1.8 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 1.9 months a year ago.
A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

Properties typically remained on the market for 19 days last month, down from 21 days from a year ago. Seventy-nine percent of homes sold in December were on the market for less than a month. 
First-time buyers accounted for 30% of sales last month, compared to 31% a year ago.

Continuing claims for state benefits rose to 1.64 million in the week ended Jan. 8.
The increase in applications may point to employers laying off staff during the most recent surge in Covid cases. Even so, the fallout should be short-lived as companies are desperate to retain and attract talent amid ongoing labor shortages.
Claims figures have been choppy in the last few weeks, reflecting challenges adjusting for seasonal effects during the holiday period.
In fact, claims fell 83,418 to 337,417 last week on an unadjusted basis. New York, Missouri and Texas were states with the biggest decreases in unadjusted claims. California registered the largest increase in applications.

Taiwan's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, rose 12.1% from a year earlier to $67.9 billion last month, the highest monthly figure on record, data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs showed on Thursday.
That marked the 22nd straight month of expansion, with the pace much faster than the median forecast for a rise of 8% in a Reuters poll.
The ministry said supply chain problems continued to ease and there was solid consumer demand for technologies such as notebook computers and 5G.
Orders for telecommunications and electronic products both hit record highs in December, normally the start of the low season with Christmas out the way, with the ministry reporting ""brisk"" demand.
The ministry said export orders for all of 2021 rose 26.3% versus 2020, reaching $674.13 billion, also a record high. Growth has been supported by the work-from-home-trend during the pandemic as well as a global semiconductor shortage.
However, while the ministry said demand would continue to be supported by tech demand, it warned supply chain issues were still present along with COVID-19 worries, and noted the first quarter was generally the low season for technology goods.
Kevin Wang, an economist at Taishin Securities Investment, said resurgent COVID-19 in the United States and China could affect the outlook, and coming off a high base last year export order growth in the first quarter was likely to stall. 
Taiwanese companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) are major suppliers to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and other global tech firms.
In November, export orders rose 13.4% from a year earlier to $65.5 billion, far better than economist forecasts.
The ministry said it expects an increase in export orders in January to be in a range of between +11% and +13.8% from a year earlier.

Orders from the United States rose 16.9% in December from a year earlier, a much faster rate of expansion compared with the 10.8% logged in November, while orders from China increased 4.5%, versus a gain of 25.3% the previous month.
Orders from Europe rose 8.2%, while those from Japan dropped 5.8%.

The jump from the previous December was the largest year-on-year increase for any month since the Federal Statistics Office began compiling the producer price numbers in 1949, the office said.
December's figures marked the third consecutive month of very high numbers after October and November showed increases of 18.4% and 19.2% respectively.
The average expectation among analysts polled by Reuters was an annual increase of 19.4%.
Producer prices also registered a record jump of 5% month on month, against 0.8% in November.

Energy prices were up 69% compared with December 2020, the Federal Statistics Office said. Stripping out energy prices, producer prices rose 10.4% on the year.
Producer prices are considered a leading indicator for inflation. They are recorded at the factory gate - before products are processed further or go on sale - and can provide an early indication of consumer price trends.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's exports and imports in December hit record highs in terms of their value in yen, data showed on Thursday, as supply bottlenecks eased at the end of 2021 amid rising prices.
However, a persistent semiconductor shortage remained a headache for Japanese firms such as automaker Toyota, which slashed its near-term output target this week, in addition to uncertainties around the Omicron variant.
""There're considerable uncertainties"" from Omicron, Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute said, adding it could derail various aspects of Japan's economy from firms' overseas supply chains to domestic consumption.
Exports in December rose 17.5% from a year earlier, Ministry of Finance data showed, outstripping a 16.0% gain expected by economists in a Reuters poll but below a 20.5% rise in November.
Yen-denominated exports and imports hit records of 7,881.4 billion yen ($69 billion) and 8,463.8 billion yen, respectively, biggest since comparable data became available in January 1979, largely as rising inflation affected both flows.
Steel exports rose 75.1% year-on-year by value, but the gain in export volume was 10.2%, suggesting soaring commodity prices pushed up values of made-in-Japan goods sold overseas.
Exports to the United States rose 22.1%, with car shipments marking their first year-on-year rise in five months at 11.9% as Japan's factory output rebounded.
Shipments to China, Japan's biggest trade partner, grew 10.8% in December from a year earlier.
ANNUAL TRADE DEFICIT
Imports by the world's No.3 economy surged 41.1% in December on higher raw material costs and a weak yen, versus expectations of a rise of 42.8% and growth of 43.8% in the previous month.
The led to a trade deficit of 582.4 billion yen ($5.09 billion) in December, versus expectations of 784.1 billion yen.
For the full year 2021, Japan reported a trade deficit of 1,472.2 billion yen, the first in two years and following a 388.3 billion surplus in 2020, amid higher fuel import costs.
""The rise of import costs is common among advanced economies, but (Japan's) problem is weak pass-through of import costs to domestic prices,"" Norinchukin's Minami said.
""The recent combination of a weak yen and high fuel costs has brought considerable damage to Japan's economy.""
The Bank of Japan has said a weak yen is likely to continue to positively impact Japan's economy, even though rising import good prices hurt households.
Japan is expected to have grown by an annualised 6.5% in the last quarter of 2021 thanks to a strong rebound in consumption, the latest Reuters poll shows.

But policymakers have been wary of risks from the rapidly spreading Omicron variant, as Japan recorded its largest daily COVID-19 infections this week.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian employment raced ahead in December as the jobless rate fell to its lowest point since 2008, showing strength that should help the economy weather the current surge in coronavirus cases across the country.
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Thursday showed employment jumped 64,800 in December, topping market forecasts of a 43,300 rise and adding to November's record jump of 366,000.
The unemployment rate fell to 4.2%, from 4.6% in November, the lowest reading since August 2008, when the jobless rate bottomed out at 4%. The ABS noted that to find a result under 4% you needed to go back to the 1970s.
Investors reacted by nudging the local dollar up to $0.7228 on wagers of an early rate increase from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which has been seeking to drive unemployment to 4% or lower to lift wage growth after years of sub-par gains.
The blistering growth in jobs hit a speed bump this month, however, as a surge in new Omicron cases spooked consumers away from shops and restaurants and played havoc with distribution systems as workers fell ill or isolated.
So far most of the hit has been to hours worked rather than to employment, with analysts estimating hours might drop 3-4% over January, though layoffs could come if the outbreak lingers through February.
Encouragingly, demand for labour remains strong with job advertisements easing only modestly in December after a run of stellar gains to leave them 33% higher on the year.
PUSHING FOR A RATE RISE
Such is the need for workers that the government on Wednesday waived the cost of visas for students and backpackers wanting to come to Australia and work part time.
Analysts hope that demand is finally stoking wage growth, though evidence so far is largely anecdotal.
Official data on wages for the fourth quarter are not out until Feb. 23 and may not show much of a pick-up given the inertia baked into the pay system in Australia.
The last measure of wages showed growth of just 2.2% a year, compared to 4.8% in the United States and 4.9% in the UK.
This is a key reason the RBA has argued that interest rates will not need to rise from their record low of 0.1% until 2023, even as the U.S. Federal Reserve seems ready to raise rates in March.
Markets are wagering a tightening will come a lot sooner, perhaps as early as May given the persistence of global inflationary pressures.
Data on Australian consumer prices for the December quarter is due next week and some economists are predicting core inflation could jump to its highest since 2009 at 2.5%, adding greatly to the case for an early rise in rates.

Bill Evans, chief economist at Westpac, on Thursday forecast an increase would now come in August, a major shift from his previous call of a first move in February next year.
""Our forecast revisions reflect a much faster lift in inflation and wages growth than envisaged,"" said Evans. ""We now expect one hike of 15 basis points in August to be followed by a further hike of 25 basis points in October.""

LONDON (Reuters) -Inflation in Britain rose faster than expected to its highest in nearly 30 years in December, intensifying a squeeze on living standards and putting pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates again.
The annual rate of consumer price inflation increased to 5.4% from November's 5.1%, the highest since March 1992, the Office for National Statistics said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise to 5.2%.
Financial markets now price in a more than 90% chance that the BoE will raise its main interest rate to 0.5% on Feb. 3. Last month it became the world's first major central bank to tighten policy since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The Bank of England was already feeling uncomfortable about its monetary policy stance. Today's upside surprises to both the headline and core inflation readings will certainly not have helped,"" said Ambrose Crofton, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
Two-year British government bond yields, which are sensitive to financial markets' interest rate expectations, came within a whisker of their highest level since 2011.
Inflation has risen sharply across most advanced economies, reflecting a global rise in energy prices and supply chain difficulties. 
But the BoE appears more concerned than the U.S. Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank that labour shortages and wage pressures will cause inflation to be slow to fall back once immediate price pressures have passed.
Speaking to lawmakers on Wednesday, Governor Andrew Bailey said financial markets expected energy prices would take longer to fall than had been the case two months ago, while BoE staff had found tentative signs inflation was pushing up pay settlements.
""Please don't think we don't think these are serious pressures. They are,"" Bailey said, when challenged over whether the central bank had been complacent about price risks.
A surge in cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant had negligible impact on inflation, ONS statisticians said. 
Instead, prices for food, hospitality and household goods were the main factors pushing up inflation in December while fuel prices - the main driver in previous months - remained at recent highs.
""Not only does this provide additional evidence that inflation is becoming endemic rather than transitory, it also bodes ill for households facing multiple rises in the cost of living this spring,"" said Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors.
APRIL PEAK?
British inflation is widely expected to peak in April when regulated household energy bills look set to increase by around 50%. Last month the BoE forecast a peak of around 6%, but now some economists see 7% as more likely.
Inflation was just 0.6% in December 2020, and the BoE repeatedly had to revise up its forecast last year. A new inflation forecast is due on Feb. 3. The last one in November showed inflation staying above its 2% target until mid-2024.
Rising inflation is also turning into a political problem for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government, which faces calls from the opposition and charities to offset the rise in energy bills, which comes at the same time as a tax increase on wages to fund higher health and social care spending.
""I understand the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, and we will continue to listen to people's concerns,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said after the inflation data.
Wednesday's figures showed that core CPI - which excludes more volatile food, energy, alcohol and tobacco prices - rose to a record 4.2% from November's 3.9%.

Retail price inflation - an older measure that the ONS says is no longer accurate, but which is still widely used by government and businesses - rose to a 30-year high of 7.5% from 7.1%.
Factory price inflation showed tentative signs that cost pressures may have peaked, cooling to 9.3% from 9.4% in November. Inflation for costs paid by producers for material and energy also decreased, to 13.5% from 15.2%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding rose to a nine-month high in December amid a surge in multi-family housing projects, but soaring prices for materials after the government nearly doubled duties on imported Canadian softwood lumber could hamper activity later this year.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday also showed the housing construction backlog surged to a record high last month, underscoring the challenges builders are facing from supply strains, including labor shortages. Completions tumbled as well. Rising mortgage rates could also restrain homebuilding.
""Builders are gladly trying to meet demand, but supply problems and labor shortages are slowing them down,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""Softwood lumber duties are going to hurt this spring.""
Housing starts rose 1.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.702 million units last month, the highest level since March. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts falling to a rate of 1.650 million units. 
The volatile multi-family housing segment accounted for the rise in homebuilding last month, with starts for buildings with five units or more surging 13.7% to a rate of 524,000 units. There is strong demand to rental housing.
Single-family housing starts, which account for the largest share of the housing market, dropped 2.3% to a rate of 1.172 million units last month. Single-family homebuilding soared in the Northeast and Midwest, likely boosted by unseasonably mild temperatures. December 2021 was the warmest December on record, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information.
The densely populated South, where the bulk of homebuilding occurs, reported an 8.2% decrease in single-family starts. Homebuilding also fell in the West.
Housing starts totaled 1.595 million in 2021, up 15.6% from 2020. But the outlook for home building this year is uncertain. The United States last November nearly doubled the duties on imported Canadian softwood lumber to 17.9% from 9% after a review of its anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders.
According to the National Association of Homebuilders on Tuesday, the aggregate cost of residential construction materials had increased almost 19% since December 2021. The NAHB said higher material costs and shortages were adding weeks to typical single-family home construction times. 
Prices for softwood lumber, used for framing, soared 24.4% in December after rising 6.9% in November, according to the latest producer price data. Lumber futures have also surged.
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
HUGE BACKLOG
The backlog of houses authorized for construction but not yet started shot up 1.1% to a rate of 270,000 last month, the highest on record. Permits for future homebuilding jumped 9.1% to a rate of 1.873 million units in December, an 11-month high. They accelerated 17.2% in 2021. 
Permits are now running ahead of starts, which should underpin homebuilding in the coming months. Permits for buildings with five units or more soared 19.9% to a rate of 675,000 units. Single-family building permits rose 2.0% to a rate of 1.128 million units.
An acute shortage of previously owned homes available for sale is supporting homebuilding, but rising mortgage rates, supply constraints together with higher house prices could make home purchasing less affordable. 
Housing completions tumbled 8.7% to a rate of 1.295 million units, reflecting a 34.3% plunge in multi-family housing units. Single-family home completions increased 3.9% to a rate of 990,000 units.
The inventory of single-family housing under construction rose 2.3% to a rate of 769,000 units last month, the highest since February 2007. Multi-family homes under construction advanced 2.4% to a rate of 737,000 units.
""As long as supply chains remain stressed, builders will struggle to complete projects, slowing sales and likely limiting growth in the supply of new homes,"" said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.45% during the week ending Jan. 13, the highest since March 2020 and up from 3.22% in the prior week, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). 
An analysis by another mortgage finance agency Fannie Mae on Wednesday showed housing affordability was increasingly becoming constrained, which could limit home sales this year.
""We observe an early indication of this in recent increases in debt-to-income measures associated with incoming mortgage originations,"" said Doug Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae in Washington. 
Mortgage rates have risen as financial markets price in an interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve in March amid high inflation and a labor market that is at or near maximum employment. 
Expectations that mortgage rates will keep rising are drawing buyers into the market. 

A report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a home increased 8% last week.
""This year is likely to be sideways at best for residential home builders,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""It will be interesting to see if higher mortgage rates cool the housing bubble in prices because the lack of new supply will likely remain the dominant trend for another year.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada's annual inflation rate accelerated in December to hit a 30-year high, data showed on Wednesday, bolstering expectations the central bank could hike interest rates as soon as next week.
Inflation rose to 4.8%, in line with analyst expectations and the highest print since it reached 5.5% in September 1991, Statistics Canada said. It was the ninth consecutive month in which headline inflation topped the Bank of Canada's 1% to 3% control range.
Core inflation measures all rose, with the closely watched CPI common measure near a 10-year high at 2.1%.
That could fuel bets the central bank will start hiking interest rates next week, despite uncertainty around the impact of the Omicron coronavirus variant. 
""We have core inflation getting to the upper end of the (Bank of Canada) target range and I think that's going to spook them,"" said Derek Holt, vice president of capital markets economics at Scotiabank.
""The worst thing they can do during the pandemic is to show they are not serious about containing cost of living pressures.""
The Bank of Canada's benchmark rate has been at a record low 0.25% since the pandemic took hold in March 2020. It previously signaled it could tighten as early as April, but money markets see a roughly 70% chance of a hike on Jan. 26. [BOCWATCH] 
Consumer price gains in December were driven by higher prices for shelter, food and vehicles. Shelter, which includes the cost of maintaining and replacing a home, posted its largest gain since July 2008, Statscan said.
Separately, Canadian home price gains accelerated in December, as buyers scrambled to act before anticipated rate hikes and re-sale supply remained constrained, Teranet data showed on Wednesday. 
Analysts said inflation could increase in the coming months, before starting to decelerate later in the year.

""A re-acceleration in energy prices, transportation issues impacting food costs and a strengthening once again in monthly house price gains suggest that we could grind a little higher still,"" Andrew Grantham, a senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said in a note.
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.3% higher at 1.2477 to the greenback, or 80.15 U.S. cents, after touching its strongest level in nearly one week at 1.2451.

COMMENTARY
ANDREW GRANTHAM, SENIOR ECONOMIST, CIBC CAPITAL MARKETS
""A few weeks ago we may have been tempted to call a peak in inflation at this point. However, a reacceleration in energy prices, transportation issues impacting food costs and a strengthening once again in monthly house price gains suggest that we could grind a little higher still, before seeing a deceleration starting around spring time.""
""For the Bank of Canada, headline inflation in Q4 as a whole was slightly below its October MPR forecasts, although there may be increasing concern regarding the length of time it will remain elevated for and a broadening of price pressures outside of food, energy and supply constrained items.""
ANDREW KELVIN, CHIEF CANADA STRATEGIST AT TD SECURITIES
""The increase in the core metrics does catch my eye insofar as that speaks to pay increasing underlying inflationary pressures. And I think on balance between that and the on-consensus headline print, you'd have to put this in the hawkish camp, in the sense that this probably does incrementally ratchet up pressure on the BOC to start lifting rates sooner rather than later.""
""I think (the rate increase) will be in January. I think that makes the most sense. I have a lot of time for the argument that they should wait until March to get through this current wave of public health measures. But I think ultimately, given the risk of inflation expectations starting to become untethered, it makes more sense and is more prudent for them to go in January. So I look for a rate hike of 25 basis points in January.""
""I think they (the BoC) did do a reasonable job of signaling (a rate hike) in December in some of the speeches. ... The markets price more than a 50% chance of a rate hike next week now. So you know, they (the BoC) can plausibly look at market pricing and say, we are reacting to the data the same way the market was, which was a line you did hear from (former) governor (Stephen) Poloz from time to time as well.""
DEREK HOLT, VICE PRESIDENT OF CAPITAL MARKETS ECONOMICS, SCOTIABANK

Prices rose in eight of the 11 major Canadian markets that make up the Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price Index, which tracks repeat sales of single-family homes.
""Some people who secured advantageous interest rates have probably brought forward transactions,"" said Daren King, an economist with National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF), in a note. 
""In addition, the lack of supply on the market is certainly putting upward pressure on prices, which should continue in the short term,"" he said.
Investors are raising bets the Bank of Canada will start hiking rates next week, despite worries that stricter restrictions to tackle surging COVID-19 cases will slice into economic growth. 
Home sales inched up 0.2% in December from November, while active listings fell to very low levels, Canada's realtors said on Monday.
Housing starts, meanwhile, fell 22% in December, but remain high in historic terms, official data showed on Tuesday. BMO Capital Markets economist Shelly Kaushik said the 6-month average was comparable to building booms in the 1970s and 1980s.
""Canada's housing market remains extremely strong, and price strength is largely driven by sky-high demand rather than lack of supply,"" she said, in a note.

The Teranet gains were led by Victoria, British Columbia at 2.1% and Halifax, Nova Scotia at 1.9%. Prices fell in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Ottawa-Gatineau, and Edmonton, Alberta.

565,"<span>Jan 19, 2022 07:05AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - The interest rate on the most popular U.S. home loan rose for a fourth straight week last week, with residential real estate borrowing costs now the highest in nearly two years as financial markets anticipate that the Federal Reserve will raise rates sooner and faster than previously expected to combat inflation.
The Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday said its weekly measure of the average contract rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage climbed to 3.64% in the week ended Jan. 14 from 3.52% a week earlier. That was the highest since March 2020 when the pandemic triggered a recession and drove borrowing costs to historic lows as the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate to near zero.
With inflation running at the highest rate in a generation and the job market near full employment, the Fed is now seen rapidly reining in the accommodation it put in place in the spring of 2020, and financial markets are frantically repricing for an initial rate hike by the central bank by mid-March. 
That reset has driven up the yields on the Treasury securities that influence mortgage rates, and home financing costs have followed suit: MBA's 30-year contract rate has climbed from 3.27% in mid-December.

The rate rise is crimping application volumes for mortgage refinancings, but appears to be helping to lift applications for home-purchase loans, which saw the largest increase in six months last week as prospective buyers looked to lock in rates that, while rising, are still historically low.
Overall loan application volumes rose 2.3% last week on the back of a 7.9% increase in loans to buy a home, while refinancing applications dropped 3.1% to their lowest level in more than two years.

568,"<span>Jan 18, 2022 06:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Australian household sentiment dropped this month in response to a surge of coronavirus cases that exacerbated existing supply chain problems and prompted shoppers to turn more cautious.
The consumer confidence index fell 2% to 102.2 points in January,  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp. said in a statement Wednesday. Optimists still outnumbered pessimists, with 100 points the dividing line between the two.
Westpac Chief Economist Bill Evans said the result was much better than the 17.7% collapse when the pandemic first hit in early 2020. Moreover, consumers in Australia’s two most populous states, which endured protracted lockdowns around mid-2021, seemed “less unsettled by the rapid spread of the omicron variant than those in states experiencing their first major wave of Covid infections,” he said.
The omicron outbreak is forcing supermarkets to impose purchase limits on products and  leaving firms struggling for staff as infected workers are forced to isolate. That’s likely to slow a recovery in the $1.5 trillion economy in the short-term at least, with a slew of growth forecast downgrades from economists. 
“The component detail shows increased concerns about the outlook for both the economy and family finances,” Evans said. “Consumers’ near-term expectations for the economy showed the biggest fall.” 
High frequency data from Australian banks have shown omicron variant kept shoppers at home during the Christmas holiday period.
Westpac’s survey showed consumers reported a significant improvement in their finances from a year ago, with the sub-index lifting 7.5% to a nine-month high of 95.6. That likely reflects a solid rebound in employment, wealth gains from a resurgent housing market and the accumulation of significant reserves due to high savings rates during lockdowns, according to the report.

Mexican gross domestic product (GDP) contracted in the third quarter https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/mexican-economy-shrinks-more-than-expected-third-quarter-2021-11-25 of 2021, and the latest figures gave rise to estimates that the economy may have done the same in the October-December period, although the data are still incomplete.
The economy shrank in October from September and a preliminary estimate for November showed the economy barely grew in comparison to the same month in 2020. Complete data for November are due to be published by INEGI on Jan. 25.
Jonathan Heath, a board member of Mexico's central bank, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that if the data already published are not revised, the Mexican economy may have contracted by 0.5% quarter-on-quarter during the final three months of last year.
Two consecutive quarters of contraction would mean that Mexico had entered a technical recession as 2021 closed out.

Mexico's recovery from the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic has been significantly undermined by bottlenecks in global supply chains.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Confidence among U.S. single-family homebuilders slipped in January after four straight monthly increases, and builders called for a new softwood lumber agreement with Canada to ease shortages and lower prices, a survey showed on Tuesday.
Other data showed factory activity in New York state slumped this month amid surging COVID-19 infections, but manufacturers remained upbeat about business conditions over the next six months. The reports supported views that the economy started the year on a soft note because of high inflation, shortages and raging coronavirus cases, driven by the Omicron variant.
""This is a reminder that COVID still holds sway over the recovery,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""U.S. supply chain dynamics didn't improve at the end of 2021, and early data suggest they've only worsened in 2022.""
The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market index dipped one point to 83 this month. A reading above 50 indicates that more builders view conditions as good than poor.
""NAHB analysis indicates the aggregate cost of residential construction materials has increased almost 19% since December 2021,"" NAHB Chairman Chuck Fowke said in a statement. ""Policymakers need to take action to fix supply chains. Obtaining a new softwood lumber agreement with Canada and reducing tariffs is an excellent place to start.""
According to the NAHB, higher material costs and shortages were adding weeks to typical single-family home construction times. The economy is struggling with high inflation, mostly the result of the pandemic, which has snarled supply chains.
The United States last November nearly doubled the duties on imported Canadian softwood lumber to 17.9% after a review of its anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders.
The Trump administration initially imposed 20% duties on Canadian softwood lumber in 2018 after the collapse of talks on a new quota arrangement, but reduced the level in December 2020 to 9%. President Joe Biden's administration had stuck to those duties until the Commerce Department's November review.
The NAHB survey was conducted during the first two weeks of January and does not fully reflect the recent jump in mortgage interest rates. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.45% during the week ending Jan. 13, up from 3.22% in the prior week, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).
More expensive building materials and higher mortgage rates could make housing less affordable, especially for lower-income groups and first-time home buyers.
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose, weighing on Wall Street stocks.
THE OMICRON EFFECT
The NAHB survey's measure of current sales conditions was steady at 90, but its gauge of sales expectations over the next six months dropped two points to 83. The component measuring traffic of prospective buyers also fell two points to 69.
A separate report from the New York Federal Reserve on Tuesday showed its ""Empire State"" index of current business conditions plunged 32.6 points to a reading of -0.7 this month. This was the first negative reading since June 2020.
A reading below zero signals a contraction in the New York manufacturing sector. New York has been slammed by a vicious winter wave of coronavirus infections which has severely disrupted business activity. The survey offered an early read of Omicron's impact on the economy. There are signs that infections have peaked in some regions, including New York.
""It is possible that the recent weakening is related to the surge in virus spread over the past several weeks and/or persisting supply issues and price pressures,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""We will see if other January manufacturing surveys released this week and beyond reinforce the downbeat message from the Empire State survey.""
Manufacturers reported a sharp decline in orders. The survey's new orders index tumbled 32 points to a reading of -5.0. There were also decreases in shipments and unfilled orders measures, though not of the same magnitude as the plunge in new orders.

The New York Federal Reserve said on Tuesday its ""Empire State"" index on current business conditions plunged 32.6 points to a reading of -0.7 this month. This was the first negative reading since June 2020.
A reading below zero signals a contraction in the New York manufacturing sector. 
New York has been slammed by a vicious winter wave of coronavirus infections, driven by the Omicron variant, which has severely disrupted business activity. The survey offered an early read of Omicron's impact on the economy.
Manufacturers reported a sharp decline in orders. The survey's new orders index tumbled 32 points to a reading of -5.0. There were also decreases in shipments and unfilled orders measures, though not on the same magnitude as the plunge in new orders.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general business conditions index plummeted to minus 0.7 from 31.9 a month earlier, a report showed Monday. Figures below zero indicate contraction, and the reading was weaker than all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
The median projection called for a reading of 25. Responses were collected between Jan. 3 and Jan. 10, when infection rates were picking up.
The 32.6-point plunge in overall business conditions was the largest since April 2020 in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic. An index of new orders dropped 32.1 points in January to minus 5, while the shipments gauge slumped 26.1 points to 1. The average workweek and employment also showed a slower rate of expansion.
At the same time, the report showed manufacturers in the state remained upbeat about the outlook. The Fed’s measure of business conditions six months from now only eased 1.3 points to 35.1, reflecting a pickup in expected orders growth.
Capital Investment
The Fed’s capital expenditures index rose to the highest since 2006 and technology spending improved slightly, indicating firms plan large increases in investment in coming months.
The price outlook also firmed, with indexes of future prices paid and received climbing the highest in data back to 2001.
Meantime, the Fed bank’s gauge of current prices paid for materials eased to a still-elevated 76.7, while an index of prices received slipped 7.5 points to 37.1. A measure of delivery times also cooled.

LONDON (Reuters) -British employers hired a record number of staff last month and labour shortages deepened - increasing the chance that the Bank of England will raise interest rates again next month - but pay was squeezed by rapidly rising inflation.
Tuesday's data suggests the surge in cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus in December did little to dent the resilience of Britain's job market. 
The figures are also unlikely to ease the BoE's concern that a rising inflation tide will be slow to ebb. Concern about possible labour shortages and pay pressures over the medium term was a major reason why the BoE raised interest rates last month for the first time since the start of the pandemic.
Financial markets see an 85% chance that the BoE will raise rates again on Feb. 3 after its next meeting, and 10-year government borrowing costs rose to a three-month high after the data. 
""Alongside rising headline inflation rates and growing evidence that Omicron's impact has been modest, a February rate rise from the Bank of England looks increasingly likely,"" ING economist James Smith said.
Employers added a record 184,000 staff to their payrolls in December, while the headline unemployment rate for the three months to November - which includes both self-employed and employed workers - dropped to 4.1%, its lowest since June 2020.
That said, some economists had doubts about the payrolls data, which often see big downward revisions. November's record reading of 257,000 was revised to 162,000 new hires on Tuesday.
Separate data showed that overall 600,000 fewer people were in employment in the three months to November compared with before the pandemic, mostly reflecting fewer over-50s in work.
More positively, the end of the government's furlough programme in September, when more than a million employees were still receiving some support, led to very few job losses. Redundancies in the three months to the end of November were the lowest on record, the Office for National Statistics said.
Job vacancies in the three months to December hit a record high of 1.247 million, more than double their level a year before.
PAY SAGS
However, pay growth slowed to its weakest in real terms since July 2020. After adjusting for inflation, average earnings excluding bonuses in the three months to November were no higher than the year before, a trend likely to intensify in 2022.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government is under pressure to address the cost-of-living squeeze and is considering ways of softening a possible 50% leap in domestic energy bills in April.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak, speaking to reporters after the data, said high inflation was a global problem driven by energy prices and problems with supply chains, but an increase to the minimum wage would help many employees.
Looking at November alone - which many economists prefer as it gives timelier data but which the ONS discourages due to volatility in the figures - inflation-adjusted pay dropped by 1.0%. 
""While some are seeing wage rises in sectors facing shortages, many workers are stuck on low wages at a time when we are seeing cost of living pressures increase significantly,"" said Ben Harrison, director of the Work Foundation think tank.
Inflation hit a 10-year high of 5.1% in November and cost-of-living concerns look set to dominate 2022. The BoE forecasts inflation will peak at a 30-year high of around 6% in April, when regulated household energy bills are due to jump by 50%.

The weakness in real earnings comes despite headline average earnings in the three months to November being 4.2% higher than a year earlier. That is a high rate compared with before the pandemic when pay growth was mostly in the 2-3% range, and it is a pace which makes the BoE uncomfortable, given weak underlying productivity growth.
Moreover, the ONS said factors which earlier in the year distorted headline pay growth, causing it to appear artificially high, had now largely dissipated.

BERLIN (Reuters) -German investor sentiment hit its highest in six months in January on expectations the incidence of COVID-19 cases will fall by early summer, allowing growth in Europe's largest economy to pick up in the coming six months, a survey showed.
The ZEW economic research institute said on Tuesday its economic sentiment index rose to 51.7 from 29.9 points in December. A Reuters poll had pointed to a rise to 32.0.
""The economic outlook has improved considerably with the start of the new year. The majority of financial market experts assume that economic growth will pick up in the coming six months,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement.
""It is likely that the phase of economic weakness from the fourth quarter of 2021 will soon be overcome. The main reason for this is the assumption that the incidence of COVID-19 cases will fall significantly by early summer.""
The German economy failed to return to its pre-pandemic size in 2021 as microchip shortages hit production in the car industry, and further COVID-19 restrictions slowed the recovery in the final months of the year.
Last week, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Group posted its lowest annual sales figures in 10 years at 8.9 million deliveries, and said it expected supply chain conditions to remain volatile in the first half of this year. [nL8N2TS1OZ]
Thomas Gitzel, economist at VP Bank, said there was reason to hope the economy would pick up. ""Once raw materials and supplies are available again in sufficient quantities and the infection situation recedes, the German economy will pull up strongly,"" he said
Health officials say the coronavirus remains a serious threat, however.
Germany has a relatively low vaccination rate compared to neighbouring countries, with 47.6% of the population having had a booster shot.
Germany's BDI industry association said last Thursday it expected the economy to grow 3.5% this year, warning companies could face another ""stop-and-go year"" due to the pandemic.
The government, in estimates published in October, predicted growth of 4.1%, up from 2.7% in 2021.

The BDI said the Omicron coronavirus variant was clouding the outlook, with Germany in particular being exposed to the risk of China, its biggest trading partner, becoming paralysed again if authorities stuck to a ""zero COVID"" lockdown response to a rise in cases.
A ZEW index for current conditions fell to -10.2 points from -7.4. The consensus forecast was for a reading of -8.5.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian consumer confidence took a battering last week as an explosion in coronavirus cases triggered self-imposed lockdowns, squashing spending and blowing holes in supply chains.
A survey from ANZ out on Tuesday showed its measure of consumer sentiment slid 7.6% last week to its lowest since October 2020, lower even than during the Delta variant surge when much of the country was officially locked down.
This time, the government has vowed to keep restrictions light, arguing that over-90% vaccination rates can ensure the economy remains open.
However, record numbers of new cases and rising deaths have seen households sharply limit their movements and spending on services, while the need for isolation has taken many thousands of workers out of essential jobs.
""We don't think the economy is as weak as these data might suggest, with the shock of the Omicron surge and strains on testing capability the key drivers of the fall rather than underlying economic conditions,"" said David Plank, ANZ's head of Australian economics.
""But the result highlights that concerns about COVID have the potential to significantly impact the economy if they linger.""
The survey made for grim reading with measures for respondents' current financial conditions diving 11.3% and for economic conditions down 7.6%. In a gloomy omen for retailers, the index of whether it was a good time to buy a major household item sank 11.4% to its lowest since August 2020.
Gareth Aird, CBA's head of Australian economics, estimated the outbreak could shave more than 1% off gross domestic product growth, and cut his forecast for the March quarter to 1.0% from 2.3% previously.

""The next few months are without a shred of doubt going to be difficult and testing for the economy,"" said Aird.
""But the rapid spread of COVID now may see us reach herd immunity by the middle of the year, and economic activity and hours worked should snap back in the June quarter.""

A net 28.0% of firms surveyed expected general business conditions to deteriorate compared with 11% pessimism in the previous quarter, the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research's (NZIER) quarterly survey of business opinion (QSBO) showed.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, 34.0% expected business conditions to worsen, versus 11.0% pessimism recorded in the previous period. The survey's measure of capacity utilisation dipped to 89.5%, from the previous quarter's 96.1%.
Acute labour shortages triggered by pandemic restrictions are underpinning a lift in wage growth and this is contributing to higher costs for business, NZIER said in its report. 
A net 61% reported increased costs in the December quarter, the highest level since June 2008, it said.

Inflation pressures are accelerating, the report said, suggesting a continued tightening of monetary policy by the central bank.
New Zealand's central bank raised interest rates for the second straight month in November to keep surging consumer prices in check and warned of more hikes.

GENEVA (Reuters) -The global job market will take longer to recover than previously thought, with unemployment set to remain above pre-COVID-19 levels until at least 2023 due to uncertainty about the pandemic's course and duration, the International Labour Organization said in a report on Monday.
The U.N. agency estimates the equivalent of around 52 million fewer jobs in 2022 versus pre-COVID levels, which amounts to about double its previous estimate from June 2021.
Disruptions are set to continue into 2023 when there will still be around 27 million fewer jobs, it said, warning of a ""slow and uncertain"" recovery in its World Employment and Social Outlook report for 2022.
""The global labour market outlook has deteriorated since the ILO's last projections; a return to pre-pandemic performance is likely to remain elusive for much of the world over the coming years,"" the report said.
Director-General Guy Ryder told journalists that there were numerous factors behind its revision, saying the ""primary one is the continuing pandemic and its variants, notably Omicron.""
The speed of recovery varies across regions, with the European and North American regions showing the most encouraging signs and Southeast Asia and South America lagging behind, according to the report. 
Still, the projected deficit in working hours this year represents an improvement over the past two years. In 2021, the ILO estimates there were some 125 million fewer jobs than pre-pandemic levels and in 2020, 258 million fewer.
Overall, around 207 million people are estimated to be unemployed in 2022. However, the report said that the impact would be significantly greater since many people have left the labour force and have yet to return.
Among those are a high number of women https://www.reuters.com/markets/funds/gender-equality-takes-one-step-forward-three-back-during-covid-2021-12-02, often because they have been drawn into unpaid work at home such as teaching children during school closures or caring for sick family members. 
The report predicted that the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on women's employment would narrow in the coming years but that a ""sizeable gap"" would remain.
""There are some anecdotal indications that they are not coming back in the same numbers and in the same portions as men are doing which would lead to concerns that a 'Long COVID' effect on gender at work would be a negative one,"" said Ryder.

Others who have left the workforce have done so voluntarily as part of a phenomenon some economists call ""the great resignation"". Ryder said this appeared to be more prominent in areas of the economy such as health and care giving.
""We do need to look again and to invest further in those areas of economic activity,"" he said.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's trade surplus narrowed more than expected in December to $1.02 billion, the lowest in 20 months, as a surge in exports driven by commodities slowed and imports hit a record high, official data showed on Monday.
Southeast Asia's largest economy has been reporting a trade surplus every month since May, 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic supressed local demand while exports rode a boom in prices of commodities like coal, palm oil, copper, tin, steel and rubber.
The December surplus was about a third of the $3.13 billion forecast by economists polled by Reuters and was also much smaller than the $3.51 billion recorded in November.
December imports hit a record high of $21.36 billion, up 47.93% on a yearly basis and beating the poll's forecast for 39.40% growth, as overseas purchases of everything from consumer goods to raw materials for the manufacturing industry jumped.
""This shows that economic activity is improving ... including consumption,"" Margo Yuwono, the head of Statistics Indonesia, told a news conference. 
Meanwhile, export growth was 35.30% on a yearly basis compared with the poll's expectation of 40.40% growth, with shipments of coal to China slowing as Beijing ramped up domestic output of the fuel.
The resource-rich country's total shipments in December were worth $22.38 billion, the second highest on record for monthly data after November's $22.84 billion.
Economists have warned that a ban on coal exports, implemented since Jan. 1 to avoid widespread domestic power outages, could shift Indonesia's trade balance to a deficit. Coal exports make up about 14% of Indonesia's overall exports.
The ban has been eased for big miners that have met domestic sales requirements, but is still affecting smaller miners whose output accounts for up to 40% of Indonesia's total.

For the whole of 2021, Indonesia's exports reached a record high of $231.54 billion, while imports totalled $196.2 billion.
The 2021 trade surplus of $35.34 billion was the biggest since 2007.

Investing.com –China’s economy grew slower in 2021, potentially impacted by a property market slump. The slower growth also prompted the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) to cut interest rates on policy loans.
Data released earlier in the day showed that the GDP grew 4% year-on-year in the fourth quarter. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a growth of 3.6% while a growth of 4.9% was recorded in the third quarter.
The GDP also grew 1.6% quarter-on-quarter. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a growth of 1.1% while a growth of 0.2% was recorded in the third quarter.
The world’s second-largest economy is facing headwinds in 2022 as outbreaks involving the omicron COVID-19 variant continue to pop up throughout the country. Electricity shortages and property sector default also contributed to the slower economy.
“Growth will continue to be weighed down by the property sector and of course, the zero-Covid policy that China is going to continue with,” Oxford Economics lead Asia economist Sian Fenner told Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, industrial production grew 4.3% year-on-year in December, compared to the growth of 3.6% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November‘s growth of 3.8%.
Industrial output sped up in December but is set to weaken in January, with restrictive measures still in place in many cities ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. Production curbs on heavy industries in China ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games could also contribute to the weakening.
Retail sales grew 1.7% year-on-year in December, compared to a growth of 3.7% predicted by Investing.com, and the growth of 3.9% recorded in November. Consumer spending fell in December as the government tightened measures in several parts of the country, including the cities of Xi’an and Tianjin.
“Retail sales numbers are still quite telling that the zero-Covid policy is still wearing on consumers, and we haven’t seen the recovery that we’ve been seeing in the industrial sector,” said Oxford Economics’ Fenner.
The unemployment rate was at 5.1% while the 5.0% was recorded in November.
Meanwhile, PBOC lowered the rate on its one-year policy loans by 10 basis points to 2.85%, the first cut since April 2020, as the property market slump and COVID-19 outbreaks dampened economic growth. The central bank also cut the rate on the seven-day reverse repurchase agreements to 2.1% from 2.2%."

China’s Economic Growth Slowed, Prompting Interest Rate Cut (10 a.m. HK)
China’s economic growth weakened last quarter in the face of slow private spending, a property market crisis and virus outbreaks.

Goldman Favors Macau Gaming in Asia HY, Advises Diversification (9:25 a.m. HK)
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) prefers Macau gaming and “non-China property B rated corporates” in Asia high-yield credit, recommending that investors stay cautious and diversified among better quality developers.   
Increasing stress levels in China’s high yield property sector suggest policy easing measures have so far been “insufficient to stabilize credit flow to developers,” analysts Kenneth Ho and Chakki Ting wrote in a report dated Friday. 
China’s Property Crisis Reaches Biggest Builder Country Garden (7:47 a.m. HK)
Country Garden’s shares and bonds were hammered last week on concerns about confidence. The company is one of the few remaining large, better-quality private developers that had been largely unscathed by the liquidity crunch, even as peers such as Shimao Group Holdings Ltd. saw dramatic reversals in their credit ratings.
 
The firm is viewed as a bellwether for contagion risk, as unprecedented levels of stress in the offshore credit market threaten to drag good credits down with bad. With more than 3,000 housing projects located in almost every province in China, Country Garden’s financial health has immense economic and social consequences. 
If Country Garden starts showing signs of stress, it will severely damage already fragile investor and homebuyer confidence, posing threats to China’s economy and even social stability.
Goldman Already Raised 2022 Junk Default Estimate: China Today (7:42 a.m. HK)
For Chinese developers, a turn of the calendar page hasn’t turned around their fortunes. Their dollar bonds have declined to new lows. It’s only mid-January, and Goldman Sachs has already raised its default forecasts for the year. 
Strategists Kenneth Ho and Chakki Ting say stresses are piling up after the pick-up in proposals for bond exchanges or maturity extensions. They now expect a 19% default rate for high-yield developers, up from a previous estimate of 11.5%.
China Home Market Slump Deepens as Prices Fall for Fourth Month (7 a.m. HK) 
New home prices in 70 cities, excluding state-subsidized housing, slid 0.28% last month from November, when they dropped 0.33%, National Bureau of Statistics figures showed Saturday. Falling prices may dissuade homebuyers concerned about the value of their assets, making it harder for developers to sell properties and generate much needed cash. 
Recent moves by authorities to ease some of the restrictions on real-estate funding have done little to boost the market. Home loan demand stayed weak in December, with households’ mid- and long-term loans, a proxy for mortgages, increasing the least since February 2020. Year-end sales campaigns by developers added to downward pressure on prices.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's core machinery orders rose for a second straight month in November, government data showed on Monday, a sign that corporate appetite for capital spending remained resilient despite pressure from soaring raw material prices.
The gain in core orders, a key indicator of capital expenditure, could be a relief to policymakers hoping for corporate investment to trigger a private demand-led recovery in the world's third-largest economy.
Core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, grew 3.4% in November from October, rising for the second straight month, the Cabinet Office data showed.
It beat economists' median estimate of a 1.4% rise and followed a 3.8% jump in the previous month.
However, Japanese firms could be cautious about boosting spending due to higher raw material, fuel and transportation costs that are sending wholesale inflation soaring and squeezing corporate margins.
""Firms may postpone capital spending from this quarter into the next fiscal year from April as uncertainty in the global economy has risen,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Due to a decline in coronavirus cases and an easing of the (global) chip shortage, orders from manufacturers recovered up to November, but the outlook is unclear.""
A government official confirmed firms' appetite for capital spending faced risks from rising raw material prices, though he added companies were still likely to spend on investments to strengthen their businesses for the future.
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude volatile numbers from shipping and electric power utilities, jumped 11.6% in November, the Cabinet office data found.
By sector, orders from manufacturers rose 12.9% month-on-month, offsetting a 0.8% drop in those from non-manufacturers, the data showed.
The government raised its assessment on machinery orders for the first time in six months, saying they showed signs of picking up. Previously, it said a pick-up in orders was showing signs of stalling.

After contracting in the third quarter of last year, Japan's economy is expected to return to growth in the October-December quarter.
The economy is forecast to show growth of an annualised 6.5% in that quarter, thanks largely to a projected pick-up in private consumption, which makes up more than half the economy, after an easing of coronavirus curbs.

Only 2% of the companies which took part in a MakeUK survey have frozen pay this year, way down from around a third of them a year ago. 
Most pay increases ranged between 2% and 3%, below the recent pace of inflation, but went as high as 14% in some cases.
However, around 45% of companies said they had yet to agree a pay deal, up from about 30% this time last year.
The Bank of England is keeping a close eye on the impact of rising inflation on pay deals, something it fears could lead to longer-term inflationary pressures. The BoE thinks inflation will hit a 30-year high of 6% in April when higher social security contributions are due to kick in.
Verity Davidge, the association's director of policy, said the outlook for pay among manufacturers compared starkly with a year earlier, when many companies froze or deferred deals as the country headed back into lockdown due to the pandemic.
Some companies felt the need to reward staff and others were trying to attract and retain key skills, Davidge said.

""As a result, the picture this year for manufacturers agreeing pay settlements is far more complex,"" she said.
The survey of 152 firms was carried out in December.

Property website Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY) said on Monday that the average price of property put up for sale rose by 0.3% in January, taking the 12-month increase to 7.6%, the highest annual rate of price growth since May 2016.
The number of buyers enquiring about homes was 15% higher than at the same time last year but the number of available homes for sale per estate agency branch sank to a new record low of just 12, Rightmove said.
There were signs of more properties hitting the market as the first working week of 2022 was the busiest start of a year on record for people asking agents to value their homes.
Britain's housing market boomed after the lifting of the first coronavirus lockdown in 2020, helped by a now-expired tax break offered by finance minister Rishi Sunak and longer-lasting demand for bigger properties among people working from home.

Tim Bannister, Rightmove's director of property data, said asking prices were within 1% of last October's record high and were the highest ever recorded for homes typically sought by first-time buyers.
""All of the signs suggest that prices are likely to continue to rise until more choice is available,"" Bannister said.

In November of 2020, the economy of the world's second largest copper producer fell by 2.08%, when Peru was still feeling the ravages of a coronavirus lockdown.
In 2021, some mining operations were severely disrupted by protests by citizens who claimed that the communities near the mines were suffering environmental damages while not benefiting sufficiently from the sector.
The official INEI statistics agency said in a statement that the economy grew 14.68% in the first 11 months of 2021.

The mining and hydrocarbons sector, key to Peru's economy because it represents 60% of its exports, fell by 5.29% year-on-year in November, basically due to lower production of copper, zinc, iron and lead, the statistics agency said.

586,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 10:10PM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's new home prices fell more slowly in December than a month earlier, official data showed on Saturday, as marginal easing on financing curbs, and promotions by property developers helped to stabilise demand. 
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities declined 0.2% in December from a month earlier, slower than a 0.3% drop in November, according to Reuters calculations from data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
China's property market has slowed since June 2021 as regulators stepped up their deleveraging campaign against the bloated sector, triggering defaults at some heavily indebted companies.
But the decline moderated as authorities and property developers in multiple cities introduced measures in December to boost home sales, with local governments providing subsidies for buyers and real estate firms offering discounts.
Monthly prices picked up in 15 of 70 cities, up from nine cities that reported price gains in November.
""The property market is gradually bottoming out with the period of tightest credit over,"" said Zhang Dawei, chief analyst at property agency Centaline. First- and second-tier cities will be the first to emerge from the downturn, he said. 
New home prices rose 2.6% year-on-year in December, slower than the 3.0% growth recorded in November.
In a recent note, Oxford Economics analysts said they expect central and local authorities to take steps to contain risks from defaults by property developers, such as increasing credit to the sector and tweaking the strict ""three red lines"" policy introduced to curb borrowing by developers.
A payment extension granted by bondholders to beleaguered developer China Evergrande Group came as authorities increasingly emphasise the need to maintain economic stability.

Yan Yuejin, research director of Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development Institute said he expects property policies to continue to ease in the first quarter given the large economic impact of the real estate market.
""The December data is a positive sign, pointing to home prices not falling further.""

587,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 01:21PM ET</span>","(Reuters) -U.S. holiday sales in 2021 came in at a better-than-expected $886.7 billion, boosted by customers returning to stores and splurging more online, even as a jump in COVID-19 cases and supply chain issues threatened to upend the crucial shopping season.
The National Retail Federation (NRF) said holiday sales, including e-commerce, jumped 14.1% during November and December, exceeding its latest forecast of a rise of as much as 11.5%.
""Despite supply chain problems, rising inflation, labor shortages and the Omicron variant, retailers delivered a positive holiday experience to pandemic-fatigued consumers and their families,"" NRF Chief Executive Officer Matthew Shay said in a statement.
With higher wages, and better household savings from stimulus checks and reduced spending on outdoor activities, U.S shoppers opened up their wallets to everything from apparel and sporting goods to furniture and electronics.
E-commerce and non-store sales jumped 11.3% over the holiday season, NRF data showed.
The make-or-break shopping season was marked by pandemic-induced shipping delays and product shortages. Some retailers such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) re-rerouted goods to less congested ports and even chartered their own vessels for deliveries.
Retailers' efforts to stock up early on helped drive 2021 holiday sales ""because even though Omicron impacted consumers' mobility in December, they had started shopping well before,"" RSM US analyst Mike Graziano said.
The Omicron-led surge in coronavirus cases at the end of the year led to a 2.7% decline in retail sales in December, which excludes automobile dealers, gas stations and restaurants, according to NRF data.

Some apparel retailers including Abercrombie & Fitch and  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) have already flagged dull holiday-quarter businesses, hit by Omicron-driven staffing shortages and a decline in store traffic.
Even though inflation and COVID-19 did not dampen holiday sales last year, the NRF said retailers should be prepared for challenges in the coming months due to pandemic-led uncertainty.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales dropped by the most in 10 months in December, likely the result of Americans starting their holiday shopping in October to avoid empty shelves at stores.
Economists cautioned against reading the unexpected plunge in retail sales last month reported by the Commerce Department on Friday as a sign of weakness. Consumer spending remains underpinned by huge savings, rising wages as companies scramble for scarce workers as well as soaring household wealth.
Still, the report and news of an unexpected decline in production at factories in December suggested the economy lost momentum at the end of 2021. That trend likely persisted into January amid spiraling COVID-19 infections, driven by the Omicron variant, which have disrupted businesses and schooling.
""It is clear that most shoppers heeded the advice to get holiday shopping done early and that, combined with a massive surge in goods spending earlier in the year, conspired to pull sales sharply lower to end the year,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Retail sales fell 1.9% last month, the largest decline since February 2021, after rising 0.2% in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales unchanged. Estimates ranged from as low as a drop of 2.0% to as high as a 0.8% increase.
Retail sales, which are mostly goods, increased 16.9% year-on-year in December. Unadjusted sales rose 10.0% last month. 
Sales could weaken further in January as Omicron limits consumer traffic to places like restaurants and bars, though some economists expect goods spending to increase as people stay at home. Retail sales are 19.2% above their pre-pandemic level. Holiday sales surged 14.1% to a record $886.7 billion in 2021, according to the National Retail Federation. 
Bottlenecks in the supply chains caused by the pandemic have led to shortages of goods. The pulling forward of sales from December also likely impacted the so-called seasonal factor, the model that the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data. 
""We do not, therefore, believe that December was a weakening demand story or more cautious behavior by consumers,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. 
The online sales category was hardest hit by the drag from the seasonal factor, plunging 8.7%. Receipts at auto dealerships slipped 0.4%. Automobiles remain scarce because of a global semiconductor shortage. 
Motor vehicles could remain in short supply for while. A separate report from the Federal Reserve on Friday showed a 1.3% drop in production at motor vehicle plants helped to pull down manufacturing output 0.3% in December. 
Production at factories increased 0.6% in November. Economists had expected output to rise 0.5%.
The Fed is still expected to start raising interest rates in March, against the backdrop of high inflation.
""We do not think today's reading will have a significant impact on the Fed's decision to liftoff rates, likely in March, which will depend more heavily on inflation than activity data,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""The seasonal adjustment factor turns highly positive in January suggesting that online sales and overall retail sales will bounce back strongly.""

Sales at electronics and appliance stores dropped 2.9%. Receipts at service stations fell 0.7% as gasoline prices retreated from higher levels seen in the prior months. Sales at food and beverage stores fell 0.5%. Sales at clothing stores declined 3.1%. There were also decreases is sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. 
Furniture store sales tumbled 5.5%, while receipts at electronics and appliance stores plunged 2.9%. But sales at building material and garden equipment suppliers rose 0.9%. 
Receipts at restaurants and bars decreased 0.8%. Restaurants and bars are the only services category in the retail sales report. These sales were up 41.3% from last December.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales plunged 3.1%. That was also the biggest drop since last February. Data for November was revised lower to show these so-called core retail sales falling 0.5% instead of dipping 0.1% as previously reported.
Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Economists lowered their fourth-quarter consumer spending forecasts after the data.
December's weakness puts consumer spending on a lower growth trajectory heading into the first quarter. Concerns about inflation could also restrain spending. Consumer sentiment fell to the second-lowest level in a decade in early January, a survey from the University of Michigan showed. 
GDP growth estimates for the fourth quarter remained bullish, thanks to rising inventory accumulation. A fourth report from the Commerce Department showed business inventories increased a strong 1.3% in November. (Graphic: Business inventories, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/mypmnbqzrvr/businv.png) 

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) trimmed its growth estimate by half-a-percentage point to a 6.5% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.3% pace in the third quarter. Growth last year is expected to have been the strongest since 1984.
""Consumer spending will remain the cornerstone of economic growth this year but the near-term path will be choppy amid surging Omicron cases and elevated inflation,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Overall, the combination of strong labor income growth, elevated excess savings and healthy balance sheets will support above-trend consumption growth this year of 4%.""

Business inventories rose 1.3% after a similar gain in October, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. November's increase was in line with economists' expectations.
Inventories increased 8.7% on a year-on-year basis in November.
Retail inventories accelerated 2.0% in November as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 0.3% rise in October. Motor vehicle inventories rebounded 4.2% instead of 4.1% as estimated last month.
That surge suggested the global shortage of semiconductors, which has constrained motor vehicle production, was abating.
An Institute for Supply Management survey last week showed improved supplier deliveries to factories in December. But there are worries that a global surge in COVID-19 cases, driven by the Omicron variant, could slow the untangling of supply chains. 
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, shot up 1.3% as estimated last month.
A slower pace of inventory drawdown in the third quarter accounted for the bulk of the 2.3% pace of increase in GDP growth for that period. Inventories were depleted through much of 2021, and coronavirus pandemic-related shortages are making it harder to replenish stocks. Restocking is keeping manufacturing humming and supporting the overall economy. 

Wholesale inventories increased 1.4% in November. Stocks at manufacturers rose 0.7%.
Business sales increased 0.7% in November after rising 2.2% in October. At November's sales pace, it would take 1.25 months for businesses to clear shelves, up from 1.24 months in October.

The University of Michigan said its preliminary consumer sentiment index fell to 68.8 in the first half of this month from a final reading of 70.6 in December.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would decline to 70.0.
Americans have been buffeted by various headwinds despite an overall strong economy, with inflation topping the list of concerns. 
At a current annual rate of 7.0%, inflation is near a 40-year-high, outstripping wage gains. Consumer price increases have broadened from a handful of pandemic-sensitive categories while supply chain disruptions have continued.
The current inflation readings have bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates in March as it seeks to bring down the rate of price increases closer to its 2% flexible target.
The last few weeks have also seen a surge in COVID-19 cases due to the highly transmissible Omicron variant, which has exacerbated labor shortages as the United States nears maximum employment.
""While the Delta and Omicron variants certainly contributed to this downward shift, the decline was also due to an escalating inflation rate,"" Richard Curtin, the survey director, said in a statement. 

""Three-quarters of consumers in early January ranked inflation, compared with unemployment, as the more serious problem facing the nation,"" he added.
Economic growth is still expected to have grown last year at its fastest pace in almost four decades after falling into a brief recession in 2020 caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

591,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 09:56AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Production at U.S. factories unexpectedly fell in December, pulled down by a decline in output at motor vehicle plants amid an ongoing global semiconductor shortage.
Manufacturing output dropped 0.3% last month after increasing 0.6% in November, the Federal Reserve said on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory production rising 0.5%. Output increased 3.5% compared to December 2020.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, remains supported by lean inventories at businesses as demand for goods remains strong. But COVID-19 and the recovery from the pandemic have overstretched supply chains, igniting inflation. 
Manufacturing production increased at a 4.9% annualized rate in the fourth quarter after rising at a 4.0% rate in the July-September quarter.
Production at auto plants dropped 1.3% last month after rising 1.7% in November. Motor vehicle output is about 6% below its year-earlier level. 
Last month's decline in manufacturing output combined with a 1.5% decline in utilities to push industrial production down 0.1%. That followed a 0.7% gain in November. Utilities were undercut by unseasonably warm weather in December, which lessened demand for heating.
Mining production rose 2.0%. Industrial production grew at a 4.0% rate in the fourth quarter. That followed a 3.5% pace of increase in the third quarter.

Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, decreased 0.2 percentage point to 77.0% in December. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector slipped 0.1 percentage point to 76.5% last month. It is 3.1 percentage points below its 1972-2020 average.
Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

BERLIN (Reuters) -The German economy failed to return to its pre-pandemic size in 2021 as microchip shortages hit production in the car industry and further COVID-19 restrictions slowed down the recovery of Europe's largest economy in the final months of the year.
Gross domestic product grew 2.7% in 2021 after plunging 4.6% in the first coronavirus crisis year 2020, preliminary figures from the Federal Statistics Office showed on Friday.
The figures, which were in line with analysts' forecasts in a Reuters poll, mean that Germany's economic output was still some 2% below the pre-crisis 2019 level, the office said.
The world's fourth-biggest economy shrank in the final three months of 2021 after growing in the previous two quarters as resurgent coronavirus infections led to renewed restrictions in retail and hospitality, the office said.
An early estimate pointed to a fourth-quarter contraction between 0.5% and 1.0% quarter-on-quarter, a spokesperson added.
The main growth drivers in 2021 were a jump in exports and massive public spending to cushion the impact of the pandemic, the office said.
However, the development and domestic production of a groundbreaking COVID-19 vaccine by German start-up BioNTech also boosted growth considerably, a statistics office spokesman said, without quantifying the impact.
Economic institutes have estimated that BioNTech alone added 0.5% to Germany's economic output last year, which would account for nearly a fifth of the overall expansion.
""I can't think of another single German company that has ever contributed so much to overall economic growth,"" said Sebastian Dullien from the macroeconomic policy institute IMK.
Germany increased net new borrowing to a record 215 billion euros ($245.87 billion) last year following an unprecedented sum of 130 billion euros in 2020 to fund the fight against COVID.
The public sector deficit of all state levels rose to 153.9 billion euros or 4.3% of economic output.
The economy ministry said in its monthly report that ongoing supply bottlenecks for important primary products in manufacturing were likely to persist for a while.

Most economists expect the German economy to shrink again in the first three months of 2022, driving it into another technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction, after the economy shrank in the first two quarters of 2020.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy grew strongly in November to finally surpass its size just before the country went into its first COVID-19 lockdown, official data showed on Friday.
The world's fifth-biggest economy expanded by a much faster than expected 0.9% in November - before the latest wave of COVID-19 infections and restrictions for many firms - leaving it 0.7% bigger than it was in February 2020, the ONS said.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast monthly gross domestic product growth of 0.4% for November.
""It's amazing to see the size of the economy back to pre-pandemic levels in November – a testament to the grit and determination of the British people,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said.
Other economies have already recovered their pre-COVID size, chief among them the United States.
Britain's economy shrank by more than 9% in 2020, one of the biggest pandemic slumps among the world's rich nations.
Despite November's growth acceleration, GDP probably took a fresh hit in December when the Omicron coronavirus variant swept Europe, and the loss of momentum is likely to have stretched into January with many firms reporting severe staff absences and consumers still wary of going out.
On Thursday, data showed record levels of staff absence due to COVID-19 around the turn of the year.
But health officials think the Omicron infections wave has now peaked in Britain and analysts say the blow to the economy is likely to be short-lived, allowing the Bank of England to continue raising interest rates this year.
The ONS said, data revisions aside, GDP in quarterly terms would reach or surpass its pre-coronavirus level in the October-December period of 2021, as long as economic output does not fall by more than 0.2% in December.
The BoE's current forecasts show GDP returning to its size at the end of 2019 in the first quarter of 2022.
EARLY CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS, MASS JABS
The ONS said retailers had a strong November - when many consumers bought Christmas presents earlier than usual - while architects, couriers and accountants also had a bumper month.
Construction recovered from several weak months as raw materials became easier to source after problems in global supply chains.
The country's rush to give booster vaccinations against COVID-19 and its test-and-trace programme provided extra momentum to the GDP figures.
Britain's economy will still face challenges in the months ahead, even once coronavirus restrictions known as ""plan B"" are relaxed.
Consumers are facing an inflation rate that is expected to reach a 30-year high of 6% or more in April - when energy tariffs will leap by an estimated 50% - and an increase in social security contributions also starting that month.
""While the UK economy should rebound once Plan B measures are lifted, surging inflation and persistent supply chain disruption may mean that the UK's economic growth prospects remain under pressure for much of 2022,"" Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said.
Sterling edged up against the U.S. dollar and the euro after the GDP data.
Separately, the ONS released trade data showing that Britain's goods trade deficit narrowed slightly to 11.3 billion pounds in November from 11.8 billion pounds in October.

Imports from non-European Union countries were higher than from EU countries for the 11th consecutive month, and the gap was at its widest point of the year, the ONS said.
Britain's trading relationship with the EU has been hit by the introduction of new post-Brexit rules after the country left the bloc's single market at the start of 2021.

Import prices dropped 0.2% last month, the first decrease since August, after increasing 0.7% in November, the Labor Department said on Friday. In the 12 months through December, prices rose 10.4% after advancing 11.7% in November.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, gaining 0.3%.
The government reported on Thursday that producer prices rose just 0.2% in December, the smallest increase since November 2020. Hopes that inflation has peaked or is close to doing so where boosted by a moderation in China's producer prices in December. Economists expect slower Chinese PPI will eventually show up in the U.S. prices. Supply chains are also improving. 
Imported fuel prices declined 6.5% last month after rising 2.3% in November. Petroleum prices fell 6.0%, while the cost of imported food increased 0.5%.

The value of overall purchases decreased 1.9%, after a revised 0.2% gain a month earlier, Commerce Department figures showed Friday. The figures aren’t adjusted for inflation, suggesting price-adjusted receipts were even weaker than the headline number.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.1% drop in overall retail sales from the prior month.
The year-end slide in retail purchases sets up for a tepid handoff to the first quarter. Combined with the impact from the omicron variant, which is denting outlays for services such as travel and dining out, the figures help explain why economists project household spending to soften.
Furthermore, falling price-adjusted wages, dwindling savings and the end of the government’s pandemic-related financial programs suggest a more moderate pace of spending.

The seasonally adjusted monthly increase of 0.6% in November from October beat the median forecast of a 0.2% decline in a Reuters poll of economists. 
Government statistics agency IBGE also revised October's indicator to a 0.2% rise from a previously reported 0.1% drop. 
IBGE said month-on-month sales plunged in five of the eight categories surveyed in November. The general result, however, was lifted by growth in sales of hypermarkets, supermarkets, food products, beverages and tobacco, up 0.9% from the previous month.
On a year-on-year basis, the 4.2% fall in November was smaller than the 6.5% slump forecast in the poll.
Retail sales were up 1.9% from the January-November period last year, posting the same growth in the 12 months through November, and slowing down from the 2.6% advance in the 12 months through October, which indicates a weaker pace of sales, IBGE said.
On a wider basis, including cars and building materials, retail sales in November rose 0.5% from the previous month, marking the first rise after three consecutive drops, said IBGE. So far this year, the increase on the same basis was of 5.3%. 

Brazil's annual inflation hit a six-year high of over 10% in 2021, pushing the central bank into one of the most aggressive rate hike cycles in the world last year. In December, the monetary authority lifted its benchmark interest rate to 9.25% from 2% in March and signaled more tightening for this year.

The trade surplus rose to $94.46 billion in December, the highest since records started in August 1994. That was up sharply from a $71.72 billion surplus in November and above a forecast for a $74.50 billion surplus in a Reuters poll.
China's hefty trade surplus with the United States, a key source of contention between the world's two biggest economies, hit $39.23 billion in December, widening from $36.95 billion the month before, but below this year's high of $42 billion in September.
China's commerce ministry said on Thursday that it hopes the United States can create conditions to expand trade cooperation, after Chinese purchases of U.S. goods in the past two years fell well short of the targets in a Trump-era trade deal.
China's exports outperformed expectations for much of 2021, but shipments have been slowing as an overseas surge in demand for goods eases and high costs pressure exporters. It was unclear how the Omicron coronavirus variant would affect that trend.
Exports increased 20.9% year-on-year last month, beating expectations for a 20% rise, but down from a 22% gain in November.
The trade data provided some support to the yuan, which looked set for the biggest weekly gain in two months.

China reported a total of 143 local confirmed COVID-19 cases for Jan. 13, its health authority said on Friday, including in the key northern port city of Tianjin.
But Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said exports may already be benefiting from Omicron's disruption to other countries' supply chains.
""We expect China's exports to remain strong in Q1 because of resilient global demand and worsening pandemic in many developing countries. Currently the strong exports may be the only driver helping China's economy,"" said Zhang.
IMPORT GROWTH
The world's second-largest economy staged an impressive recovery from the pandemic, with exports helping to buoy growth as several other sectors were faltering, but there are signs the momentum is flagging. 
A property downturn and strict COVID-19 curbs could hurt the 2022 outlook, with some analysts pointing to the slowdown in import growth as evidence that this is already happening.
Imports rose 19.5% year-on-year in December, the customs data showed, missing a forecast for a 26.3% rise and down sharply from a 31.7% gain in November.
""Imports dropped back sharply, consistent with continued domestic weakness, especially in the property sector,"" said Evans-Pritchard.
Customs data showed China's imports of the key steelmaking ingredient iron ore slipped from the month before on steel production curbs and slowing property construction.
""We expect import growth to remain muted in H1 this year as China's domestic demand will continue to be dampened by the property slowdown and weak consumption,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, in a note.
China's economic growth is likely to slow to 5.2% in 2022, before steadying in 2023, a Reuters poll showed, as the central bank steadily ramps up policy easing to ward off a sharper downturn.

Investing.com – Growth in China’s exports and imports slowed down in December, with signs of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy. However, solid demand continued to buoy Chinese exports.
Exports grew 20.9% year-on-year in December, higher than the 20% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but lower than November’s 22% growth. Exports outperformed expectations for much of 2021, but shipments have slowed as an overseas surge in demand for goods decreases and high costs hit exporters.
Imports grew 19.5% year-on-year, below both the 26.3% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November's 31.7% growth. The trade balance was $94.46 billion in December, higher than the $74.50 billion forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November’s $71.72 billion figure.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina inflation rose back up to 3.8% in December, the government said on Thursday, above forecasts and to its highest level since last April, driven by consumers splurging on festive feasts and holidays in the last month of the year.
The result, higher than the median forecast from analysts polled by Reuters of 3.6%, also saw running 12-month inflation clocked at 50.9% in the month. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) had risen 2.5% in November.
""The acceleration of inflation versus November is explained by the collection of bonuses and vacations, people spending pesos faster to buy items for parties and holidays,"" said Natalia Motyl, economist at the Fundacion Libertad y Progreso.
Argentina's government has been battling to tamp down rampant inflation, which is running at an annual rate of over 50%, with caps on exports of some meat cuts and grains as well as price freezes on many consumer goods.
The country's central bank recently hiked the benchmark interest rate to 40%, its first raise in over a year.

""Despite the freezes of some 1,400 products, the initial impact that was seen in November was offset by price increases outside the agreement,"" said Isaias Marini, economist at consultancy Econviews, adding meat prices had made a big impact.
""It's now a challenging start for 2022 in terms of prices, with inflation in 2021 appearing to set a floor for things. With tariffs and exchange rate adjustments, we project that inflation in 2022 will end at 58%.""

The World Economic Situation and Prospects 2022 report said 2021 growth momentum - following a contraction of 3.4% in 2020 - began to slow by the end of the year, including in big economies like China, the European Union and the United States, as the effects of fiscal and monetary stimuli faded and major supply-chain disruptions surfaced.

""Global headline inflation rose to an estimated 5.2 percent in 2021, more than 2 percentage points above its trend rate in the past 10 years,"" it said.
The report also warned that an emerging longer-term consequence of the coronavirus pandemic was higher levels of inequality within and between countries. 

""For the vast majority of developing countries, a full recovery of GDP per capita will remain elusive. The gap between what they will achieve and what they would have achieved without the pandemic will persist well into 2023,"" the report projected.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased to an eight-week high in the first week of January amid raging COVID-19 infections, but remained at a level consistent with a rapidly tightening labor market.
The weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday also offered more evidence that the jobs market was at or near maximum employment. State unemployment benefit rolls at the start of the year were the smallest since 1973. There are signs the worst of high inflation is likely over, with producer prices posting their smallest gain in 13 months in December.
Shrinking labor market slack and strong price pressures have left economists anticipating that the Federal Reserve would increase interest rates in March.
""The rise in claims likely reflects an increase in layoffs due to the surge in COVID cases,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Claims may remain elevated in the near term, but we expect they will gravitate back to the 200,000 level once the Omicron wave passes."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 23,000 to a seasonally adjusted 230,000 for the week ended Jan. 8, the highest reading since mid-November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 200,000 applications for the latest week.
A surge in coronavirus cases, driven by the Omicron variant, has disrupted activity from airlines to schools as workers call in sick. Unadjusted claims jumped 103,693 to 419,446 last week.
They were driven by surges in New York, which has seen sky-rocketing cases. There were also big increases in filings in California, Florida, Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Indiana. But applications fell significantly in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Michigan.
Omicron infections are starting to trend lower in New York and other metropolitan areas. Claims have declined from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020 and remain close to their pre-pandemic levels.
Employers are hanging on to their workers, with 10.6 million job openings at the end of November.
The Fed's Beige Book report on Wednesday of anecdotal information on business activity, collected from contacts nationwide on or before Jan. 3, showed many were allowing part-time work or adjusting qualifications ""to attract more applicants and retain existing workforces.""
With more workers getting off unemployment benefits rolls, the labor pool could expand. The claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 194,000 to 1.559 million in the week ended Jan. 1. This was the lowest reading for these so-called continuing claims since the week ending June 2 in 1973.
The government reported last Friday that the unemployment rate fell to a 22-month low of 3.9% in December. The workforce is about 2.2 million people smaller than before the pandemic.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading mostly higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
RAYS OF HOPE
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said the producer price index for final demand increased 0.2% last month. That was the smallest gain in the PPI since November 2020 and followed a 1.0% jump in November. 
The PPI was restrained by a 0.4% drop in goods prices, the first decline since April 2020. That reflected decreases in food and energy prices. Goods prices advanced 1.1% in November. Excluding food and energy, goods prices rose 0.5% after increasing 0.8% in November.
Services prices rose 0.5% after accelerating 0.9% in November. In the 12 months through December, the PPI increased 9.7% after shooting up 9.8% in November.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices rose 0.4% in December. The so-called core PPI vaulted 0.8% in November. In the 12 months through December, the core PPI rose 6.9%, matching November's increase. 
""Monthly price increases are slowing but still high, and the Fed won't veer off its path to finish tapering in March and start hiking rates this year,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York.
The government reported on Wednesday that consumer prices soared 7% year-on-year in December, the largest gain since June 1982.
With the PPI and CPI data in hand, economists are forecasting that the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose about 0.5% in December, which would lift the year-on-year increase to 4.9% from 4.7% in November. 
The core PCE price index is one of the measures watched by the Fed for its 2% inflation target.
Inflation is surging as COVID-19 and the recovery from the pandemic have caused bottlenecks in the supply chain. There are hopeful signs that the supply logjam could be breaking up. 

An Institute for Supply Management survey last week showed manufacturers reporting improved supplier deliveries in December, though soaring Omicron infections pose a risk to supply chains. Data on Tuesday showed China's factory-gate prices rose more slowly than expected in December. 
""Some softening in China's PPI will have implications for U.S. inflation by taking some of the edge off core goods prices,"" said Bernard Yaros, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Odds are the first place weaker growth in China's PPI will show up in the U.S. is in import prices, then producer prices, and finally consumer prices.""

604,"<span>Jan 13, 2022 10:42AM ET</span>",,,,,,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's huge tourism sector will come close to reaching its pre-pandemic size in 2022, an industry association said, although the surge in the Omicron variant and supply issues will prevent a full recovery this year.
Spain was the world's second most visited country before the pandemic. Holidaymakers flocked to its beaches and historic buildings while trendy cities like Barcelona and Madrid were popular for short breaks. 
Industry association Exceltur expects Spain's tourism gross domestic product to be worth 135 billion euros ($155 billion) in 2022, 88% of pre-pandemic levels, versus 57% in 2021, when a partial recovery of domestic tourism didn't offset a contraction in international travellers.
Activity would return to levels prior to the pandemic only in 2023, the group said.
With infections breaking records almost daily as the Omicron variant sweeps across Europe, Exceltur warned that a recovery in tourism was unlikely to start in earnest before April.
""Most business people are again postponing the full recovery of revenues to pre-pandemic levels to 2023, as a result of the triple impact of the Omicron, the energy and supply crisis at the end of 2021,"" Exceltur said.
Beaches and the countryside are expected to see a strong recovery while urban destinations, which are more dependent on international demand and business travel, expect a less intense recovery, it said.
If the forecasts are accurate, tourism will contribute to 10.5% of Spain's overall GDP, versus 5.5% in 2020 and the 7.4% Exceltur expects for 2021.

Spain's COVID-19 infection rate as measured over the past 14 days hit a new record of 3,128 cases per 100,000 people on Wednesday, a more than tenfold increase since the start of December.

In the 12 months through December, the PPI increased 9.7% after accelerating 9.8% in November.

606,"<span>Jan 13, 2022 08:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Prices paid to U.S. producers rose in December by less than expected as two key drivers of inflation in 2021 -- food and energy -- declined from a month earlier, suggesting cost pressures may be starting to ease.  
The producer price index for final demand increased 0.2% from the prior month and 9.7% from a year earlier, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The annual advance was the second-largest in figures back to 2010.
The median projections in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.4% increase from a month earlier and a 9.8% annual jump. 
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PPI climbed 0.5% in December and was up 8.3% from a year earlier. 
The December pullback reflected declines in the costs of gasoline and food. The prices of services increased from a month earlier, though more moderately. The figures suggest rapid inflation is poised to cool after a combination of materials shortages, limited labor and transportation bottlenecks sent prices soaring last year. 
However, the omicron variant presents an upside risk over the short term to goods prices in the months ahead, as quarantines and illness prevent many from working. 
A closely watched inflation gauge, the consumer price index, rose 7% last year, the most in nearly four decades, according to data out Wednesday. The monthly advance exceeded projections, setting the stage for the Federal Reserve to begin hiking interest rates as soon as March. Economists expect consumer inflation to moderate over 2022.
Producer prices excluding food, energy, and trade services -- a measure often preferred by economists because it strips out the most volatile components -- rose 0.4% from the prior month. Compared with a year earlier, the gauge increased 6.9%.
Latest Fed Beige Book Assessment:
“Wholesale and materials prices contributed to pricing pressures across a wide range of industries, spanning service providers and goods producers. Many contacts attributed the high cost of inputs to ongoing supply chain disruptions. Some Districts reported that transportation bottlenecks had stabilized in recent weeks, though procurement costs remained elevated.”
Costs of processed goods for intermediate demand, which reflect prices earlier in the production pipeline, declined 0.3% in December, the first decrease since April 2020. Compared with a year earlier, the measure jumped 24.4%.

Initial unemployment claims totaled 230,000 in the week ended Jan. 8, up 23,000 from the prior period, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 200,000 applications.
Continuing claims for state benefits dropped to 1.6 million in the week ended Jan. 1.
The increase in unemployment claims could suggest that businesses are laying off employees as a result of the most recent surge in coronavirus infections. That said, the uptick should be short-lived as the latest Covid-19 wave ebbs and as employers continue to push to retain staff amid an ongoing labor shortage.
The jump may also reflect difficulties adjusting for seasonal effects over the holidays, which have made claims figures in recent weeks hard to interpret.

608,"<span>Jan 13, 2022 05:06AM ET</span>","BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's BDI industry association said on Thursday it expected Europe's largest economy to grow 3.5% this year, giving a more cautious forecast than the government as it warned companies could face another ""stop-and-go year"" due to the pandemic.
""The order books are full, but production is not keeping pace with demand. Pandemic restrictions and supply bottlenecks affect large parts of the economy,"" BDI President Siegfried Russwurm said.
The BDI forecast is less optimistic than the government's estimates, published in October, in which Berlin predicted gross domestic product growth to accelerate to 4.1% this year from an estimated 2.6% in 2021.
The industry lobby group said it expected export growth to halve to some 4% this year, pointing to supply problems with microchips and other important components which have hit production in Germany's large automobile sector badly.
Russwurm said the Omicron coronavirus variant was clouding the growth outlook around the world, with Germany in particular being exposed to the risk of China, its biggest trading partner, becoming paralysed again if authorities there reacted to a renewed spread with its strict ""zero COVID"" lockdown measures.
The BDI president backed calls from Chancellor Olaf Scholz to improve Germany's relatively low inoculation rate by introducing a controversial coronavirus vaccination mandate.
Some 72% of Germany's population is double vaccinated against the virus and around 43.5% have received a booster shot.

""It's definitely not an option now to somehow continue to navigate until the warmer season, then enjoy the lower incidence rates over the summer ​- and realize in autumn again that the vaccination rate is too low,"" Russwurm said.
Germany on Thursday morning reported a record 81,417 new infections over the past 24 hours due to the highly contagious Omicron variant. Its seven-day incidence rate per 100,000 people jumped to 427.7, quickly approaching the country's all-time high of 452 reached late November.

Exports in December were expected to have risen 20.0% from a year earlier, according to the median forecast of 29 economists in the poll, still robust but moderating from a 22.0% expansion in November. 
Imports were forecast to have risen 26.3% from a year earlier, the poll showed, compared with 31.7% in November.
The customs authority will release the data on Jan. 14.
China's booming exports outperformed expectations for much of 2021 and buoyed growth in the world's second-largest economy as several other sectors were faltering, but analysts expect shipments to slow eventually as an overseas surge in demand for goods eases and high costs pressure exporters.
China has also seen a handful of Omicron cases as it battles small-scale outbreaks in several regions, adding uncertainty to the outlook.
""Even Hong Kong and mainland China, shielded by some of the world's toughest external quarantine measures, have seen Omicron slip through their defences,"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian Economics Research at HSBC, in a note.
Omicron could cause ""hugely disruptive"" supply chain stumbles in Asia if it leads to large numbers of sick factory workers or tough lockdown measures, said Neumann. 
The port city of Tianjin reported an increase in COVID-19 infections on Thursday as it stepped up efforts to rein in an outbreak that has spread the highly transmissible Omicron variant to another Chinese city.
China's vice commerce minister said on Dec. 30 that the country will face an unprecedented degree of difficulty in stabilising foreign trade in 2022, as other exporters ramp up production and amid a less-favourable base of comparison.
China staged an impressive rebound from the pandemic but there are signs the recovery is losing steam amid regulatory crackdowns and debt troubles in the property sector.
Factory activity grew at its fastest pace in six months in December, driven by production hikes and easing price pressures, but a weaker job market and business confidence added uncertainty, a private survey showed.
The central bank has said it will keep monetary policy flexible as it seeks to stabilise growth and lower financing costs for businesses amid growing economic headwinds.

China would not necessarily gain export market share from Omicron-related disruptions hurting competitors, as it did during previous waves of the pandemic, said analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in a note.
""Supply chains in other Asian exporters may have turned more robust and could better withstand disruptions from Omicron.""

The Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday said its weekly measure of the average contract rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage jumped to 3.52% in the week ended Jan. 7 from 3.33% a week earlier. That was the largest weekly increase since March 2020 and pushed the prevailing rate to around where it was just before the pandemic triggered a recession and drove borrowing costs to historic lows when the Fed cut its benchmark rate to near zero.
That era now appears to have passed, however. Mortgage rates had been edging higher for the past several months, but the large jump in rates last week followed the release of the minutes of the Fed's December meeting. That readout showed the policymakers were prepared to combat surging inflation with higher interest rates and a likely reduction in the Fed's holdings of more than $8 trillion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.
That is crimping mortgage application volumes, especially for loan refinancings, with rates now around half a percentage point higher than where they were three months ago.

""Rates at these levels are quickly closing the door on refinance opportunities for many borrowers. Although refinance activity changed little over the week, applications remained at their lowest level in over a month, and conventional refinance applications were at their lowest level since January 2020,"" said Joel Kan, MBA’s Associate Vice President of Economic and Industry Forecasting.
Overall loan application volumes rose 1.4% last week on the back of a 2.2% increase in loans to buy a home, while refinancing applications edged down by 0.1%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial services grew for the third quarter in a row in the last three months of 2021 and at their fastest pace since mid-2017, even though COVID-19 dampened optimism, a survey of 105 firms in the sector showed.
A year since the Brexit transition period ended, the health of British financial services is being closely monitored after the City of London was largely cut off from the European Union.
""While volumes and profitability growth across the financial services sector remain buoyant, the softening in optimism is something to watch closely, due to increased COVID-19 uncertainty clouding the near-term economic outlook,"" CBI Chief Economist Rain Newton-Smith said in statement.
The survey of 105 financial firms by the CBI employers group and consultants PwC was completed just before fresh restrictions were introduced in Britain last month to tackle spiralling cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus.
In the first three months of 2022, firms expect activity to remain robust and at a strong pace, the survey found.
Profitability growth is expected to ease somewhat in the coming months, with numbers employed predicted to grow solidly and retaining talent the top workforce priority, it said.

Looking just beyond the first quarter, Britain has said that large companies must disclose climate-related financial data from April 2022 using a globally-agreed set of guidance.
The survey showed that 40% of firms were ""somewhat prepared"" for April, with 14% saying there were not ready, and remaining companies saying they were fairly or very prepared.

(Reuters) - The U.S. economy expanded at a modest pace through the end of last year, with American firms noting that growth continues to be constrained by supply chain disruptions and labor shortages while prices exhibited ""solid growth,"" a survey conducted by the Federal Reserve showed on Wednesday.
The Fed's latest ""Beige Book"" collection of anecdotes about the state of the economy from businesses, labor groups and others across the central bank's 12 regions nationwide also signaled that the fast-spreading Omicron variant of COVID-19 was exacerbating conditions on several fronts as 2022 approached.
Omicron, which drew 44 references in the report, was seen adding to existing challenges around hiring and inflation, in particular, and was a set back for a travel and leisure sector that had only just begun to get back on its feet around the middle of last year. 
Employment grew ""modestly"" and most districts said demand for workers remains strong, with some businesses struggling to retain employees. One manufacturer in the Dallas Fed district, for example, reported extreme turnover among new hires, ""saying three to five hires were needed for even one to stay on.""
""Although optimism remained high generally, several districts cited reports from businesses that expectations for growth over the next several months cooled somewhat during the last few weeks,"" the report said.
THE FED SHIFTS GEARS
With inflation now persistently running at more than twice its flexible 2% annual target, the Fed is already taking measures to rein it in. It has signaled that the era of ultra-easy monetary policy, in place since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, is effectively over even as the Omicron variant spurs a record wave of infections across the country and around the world.
On Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told the U.S. Senate Banking Committee during his confirmation hearing for a second term as central bank chief that the economy should weather the current COVID-19 surge with only ""short-lived"" impacts and was ready for the start of tighter monetary policy.
The Fed began reducing its monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, introduced to help nurse the economy through the COVID-19 pandemic, in November. It is now set to taper that program completely by mid-March, clearing the way for it to begin hiking interest rates at its March 15-16 policy meeting.
Data from the U.S. Labor Department earlier on Wednesday showed prices at the consumer level rising by 7% on a year-over-year basis in December, the fastest pace of increase since 1982, although officials and private economists see it near the cresting point.
OMICRON HEADWINDS
While the report's headline characterization of the economy seeing ""modest"" growth was a slight downgrade from the ""modest to moderate"" description applied in the two preceding reports, the tone throughout the report still was more upbeat than down. Conditions were described as ""positive"" at twice the rate of ""negative,"" and ""improvement"" or ""improved"" appeared about seven times more than ""deteriorated.""
That said, Omicron's arrival late last year was a clear restraint, perhaps most notably in the leisure and hospitality sector. In the report, contacts nationwide noted ""a sharp pull back in leisure travel, hotel occupancy and patronage at restaurants as the number of new coronavirus cases rose in recent weeks.""
More broadly it upended daily operations for all manner of businesses as greater numbers of workers fell sick or had to isolate after contact with someone who was infected.
For instance, Omicron ""contributed to labor shortages and sparked some concern about the short-term outlook in the hospitality, transportation, and retail sectors,"" the St. Louis Fed reported.
Meanwhile, the Atlanta Fed said: ""In late December, some employers noted an uptick in absenteeism related to Omicron which resulted in curtailed operations.""
And, while for manufacturers in the Kansas City Fed's district COVID was ""not a top concern for most businesses...most contacts said they would see some disruption"" from the virus, it said.

Disruptions aside, though, businesses reported ending the year with strong sales and profits. 
In the Philadelphia district, the report said that in that region ""overall many firms, especially larger ones, noted strong profits – ""the best year ever"" for some.""

The December deficit was 85% lower than the year-ago deficit of $144 billion, and was the smallest since a December 2019 deficit of $13 billion, just before the COVID-19 pandemic threw the global economy into a tailspin.
December receipts grew 41% to a monthly record of $487 billion, while outlays grew 4% to a record $508 billion.

December's results were driven by a 44% increase in individual withheld income and payroll taxes, while other individual tax payments rose 13% for the month.

The consumer price index increased 0.5% last month after advancing 0.8% in November, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. In the 12 months through December, the CPI surged 7.0%. That was the biggest year-on-year increase since June 1982 and followed a 6.8% rise in November.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI gaining 0.4% and shooting up 7.0% on a year-on-year basis. 
The economy is experiencing high inflation as the COVID-19 pandemic snarls supply chains. The high cost of living is weighing on President Joe Biden's approval rating. 
Inflation is well above the Fed's 2% target and is also being lifted by budding wage pressures. The government reported last Friday that the unemployment rate dropped to a 22-month low of 3.9% in December, suggesting that the labor market is at or near maximum employment.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday said the U.S. central bank stood ready to do what was necessary to keep high inflation from becoming ""entrenched,"" in testimony during his nomination hearing before the Senate Banking Committee for a second four-year term as head of the bank.
""The laundry list of reasons for the Fed to begin removing monetary policy accommodation is growing,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Inflation would need to decelerate rapidly to take some of the pressure off the Fed and this is unlikely to occur.""
Money markets currently price about 85% odds of an interest rate hike by March, and a total of at least three quarter-point hikes by year-end. [FEDWATCH]
Economists believe the year-on-year CPI rate probably peaked in December or will likely do so by March. There are signs that supply bottlenecks are starting to ease, with an Institute for Supply Management survey last week showing manufacturers reporting improved supplier deliveries in December.
But soaring COVID-19 cases, driven by the Omicron variant, could slow progress towards normalization of supply chains.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI increased 0.6% last month after rising 0.5% in November. In the 
12 months through December, the so-called core CPI accelerated 5.5%. That was the largest year-on-year gain since February 1991 and followed a 4.9% advance in November.

Core inflation is being driven by rising prices for services such as rentals, as well scarce goods like motor vehicles. The year-on-year core CPI rate is seen peaking in February.
""The first quarter should see inflation peaking, with lower energy prices and a decline in food and auto inflation allowing for a slower increase in prices for the rest of the year,"" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Funds in New York.

617,"<span>Jan 12, 2022 08:30AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending on online shopping during the holiday season was weaker than expected, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Analytics data showed, as supply chain issues caused product shortages and delayed deliveries.
Consumers spent a record $204.5 billion online over the 2021 holiday season, an increase of 8.6% from a year earlier, Adobe Analytics said in a report on Wednesday.
But the figure was lower than the $207 billion expected by Adobe and marked the smallest rise since the company started tracking holiday spending data in 2014.
Congested ports, coronavirus-related factory closures in Asia and shortages of shipping containers and truck drivers shrank both global and U.S. holiday inventory by 2%, according to data from Salesforce (NYSE:CRM).
Adobe, which covers more than one trillion visits to U.S. retail websites in its analysis, said shoppers saw over 6 billion out-of-stock messages online, a more than threefold increase from pre-pandemic levels.
The holiday rush was also softened by early promotions that encouraged shoppers to splurge on everything from toys and video games to electronics outside of the biggest shopping days.
For instance, during the Cyber Week - the period between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday - consumer spending dropped 1.4%.
""This holiday shopping season was the first time where big promotional moments like Cyber Monday and Black Friday took on less of the spotlight,"" said Taylor Schreiner, senior director, Adobe Digital Insights.
Adobe's data showed online prices rose 3.1% in December, marking the 19th consecutive month of increase, with discounts narrowing on categories like electronics and sporting goods during the full season.

The rise in holiday sales was mostly due to the inflation-driven jump in costs and lower discounts, said Rob Garf, vice president and general manager of retail for Salesforce.
""Consumers were buying fewer items at higher prices at fewer retailers,"" Garf said.

The number of workers on short-time work schemes, also known as Kurzarbeit, rose by nearly a quarter to 879,000 from 712,000 in November, Ifo estimates based on its monthly business sentiment survey showed.
""The jump in coronavirus cases increased short-time work in the hospitality and retail sectors in particular,"" Ifo researcher Sebastian Link said.
The number of short-time workers increased to 126,000 from 75,000 in hospitality, and to 53,000 from 23,000 in retail. 
In manufacturing, it rose to 390,000 from 381,000 as factories continue to struggle with supply shortages in microchips.
High infection rates during the fourth coronavirus wave in Germany, triggered by the Delta variant, resulted in restrictions for retailers and service providers in December.
Germany banned unvaccinated people from entering non-essential establishments. The so-called 2G rule, which allows access only for vaccinated or recovered people, hit Christmas business. In addition, the rapid spread of the Omicron variant is clouding the outlook for retailers.
The Labour Office has cautioned the jump in COVID-19 cases and renewed restrictions to contain the spread of the disease increased uncertainties for the labour market. 

In a sign of this, more companies signalled they could soon put more workers on furlough again.
In October, the latest month for which reliable data was available, the number of employees on Kurzarbeit schemes fell to 710,000. That was down sharply from a peak of around 6 million in April 2020.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's auto sales last year grew for the first time since 2017, industry data showed on Wednesday, boosted partly by a jump of 1.5 times in sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs).
Overall sales in the world's biggest car market rose 3.8% year-on-year, after monthly sales of 2.79 million vehicles in December brought total sales for 2021 to 26.28 million，data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) showed.
Production and sales are expected to be better in 2022 than last year on the prospect that issues such as chip shortage and high prices of raw materials ease, CAAM said in a statement.
After decades of upbeat growth, China's car market started contracting in 2018 under pressure from the phasing out of some tax cuts, a trade war between Washington and Beijing and amid the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The market had started to bounce back by mid-2020, but was pulled down by a global shortage of semiconductors, used in everything from brake sensors to power steering to entertainment systems, which led automakers around the world to cut or suspend production.
China's auto sales in December fell 1.6% from a year-ago period, the eight consecutive monthly drop, CAAM data showed.
But the sales of NEVs were a bright spot, including battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in petrol-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, showing strong momentum with a growth of 157.5% to 3.52 million units in 2021.
In December alone, 531,000 NEVs were sold, representing a surge of 114% year-on-year. China has in recent years heavily promoted NEVs as part of its efforts to curb air pollution.
Last month, CAAM said it expects automobile sales to rise 5.4% to 27.5 million this year, and for NEV sales to grow 47% to five million.
China will cut subsidies on NEVs, such as electric cars, by 30% in 2022 and withdraw them altogether at the end of the year, deeming that the market has matured enough in terms of demand to grow without the aid of government help. 
But while China's EV market is seeing a very strong growth, most foreign automakers have lagged their Chinese counterparts in designing smart cars that appeal. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the only foreign brand among the top ten.

On Tuesday, data from another Chinese auto association showed that U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc sold a record 70,847 China-made vehicles in December.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said it missed its goal of selling 80,000 to 100,000 units from its ID battery electric series last year, having sold 70,625 vehicles, but that it would likely double sales this year.

Investing.com – China’s consumer and factory-gate inflation cooled in December as the government intervened to retain materials prices.
Data released earlier in the day showed that the consumer price index (CPI) grew 1.5% year-on-year, lower than the 1.8% growth predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November’s 2.3% growth. It contracted 0.3% month-on-month in 2021, down from the 0.2% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the previous month’s 0.4% growth.
The data also showed that the producer price index (PPI) grew 10.3%, lower than the growth of 11.1% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November’s 12.9% growth.
Slower growth in both indexes indicated easing inflationary pressure as the government stepped in to curb soaring high raw material prices and tackle power shortages.
However, the world’s second-largest economy still faces challenges in 2022 such as property woes, slowing manufacturing, and COVID-19 outbreaks. For some investors, softer inflation could lead to further monetary easing.
“The probability of a rate cut in the first quarter is high, and the closest window is this month,” China Renaissance Securities Hong Kong Ltd. head of macro and strategy research Bruce Pang told Bloomberg.
Consumer inflation “will not be a concern in 2022” and the core measure without counting volatile food and energy costs, will stay below 1.5%, he added.
Meanwhile, measures to tackle COVID-19 outbreaks are expected to weigh on the economic outlook. Several places are reporting an increasing number of COVID-19, including the city Shenzhen as well as Henan and Shanxi provinces. The city of Tianjin, where cases involving the omicron COVID-19 variant were discovered, is advising citizens to stay put for Chinese New Year, a peak travel period."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's most populous state, New South Wales, suffered its deadliest day of the pandemic on Wednesday, with surging Omicron infections leading to staff shortages that have disrupted supply chains and hampered the economy's recovery.
Australian businesses are grappling with the growing toll of workers out sick or ordered to isolate for being close contacts. But the virus is also scaring customers away from airlines, entertainment and hospitality sectors, already battered by several lockdowns over the past two years. 
""Essentially (small businesses) are in a lockdown ... there is little support out there to help them keep their doors open,"" Alexi Boyd, head of the Council of Small Business Organisations, told broadcaster ABC on Wednesday.
Australia's daily infections on Wednesday lingered near records with around 100,000 reported so far. Forty-two new deaths were registered, with New South Wales suffering its worst day of the pandemic with 21 deaths. 
Labour shortages and caution about being in public places have stifled household spending, ANZ said in a research note, with spending in early January resembling lockdown conditions in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's largest cities. 
Before the Omicron outbreak erupted during the Christmas period, the economy had been making a surprisingly strong recovery. In November, employment levels rose far faster than expected as coronavirus lockdowns were lifted, and retail sales also surged for a second consecutive month.
Amid pressure on supply chains, supermarket chain  Coles Group  (OTC:CLEGF) reintroduced purchase limits on toilet paper, some meat products and medicines. 
Fielding criticism at the beginning of an election year over his handling of the Omicron outbreak, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has proposed to ease isolation rules for asymptomatic workers ahead of a national cabinet meeting on Thursday.
The head of Melbourne's Chapel Street Precinct, a local marketing body representing around 2,200 commercial entities, said the controversy over tennis superstar Novak Djokovic has ""created the perfect distraction"" for Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews and Morrison.

""(The Djokovic case) means nowhere near enough attention is being focussed on the absolute decimation of small businesses,"" General Manager Chrissie Maus said.
An Australian court on Monday quashed the government's decision to cancel Djokovic's visa over questions of his medical exemption status but he still faces the threat of deportation.

Consumer price inflation also slowed last month as food prices fell, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement.
The producer price index (PPI) climbed 10.3% from a year earlier, the data showed. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected the PPI index to gain 11.1% after a 12.9% rise in November.
Factory inflation has moderated in recent months from a 26-year high in October as Beijing intervened to stabilise high raw material prices and ease an energy power crunch.
""Factory gate inflation will probably trend down further over the coming months,"" said Sheana Yue, China economist at Capital Economics, in a note.
""With coal supply improving and property construction slowing, we see further downside to the price of industrial metals and energy.""
China's consumer price index (CPI) grew 1.5% year-on-year in December. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected a 1.8% uptick, after a 2.3% increase in November. 
Food prices fell 1.2% year-on-year, with Yue pointing to a recovery in the supply of pork and vegetables after disruptions caused by bad weather in October and November.
The CPI rose 0.9% year-on-year in 2021, down from a 2.5% gain in 2020.
""Lower inflation opens room for the government to loosen monetary policies further. The probability of (an) interest rate cut is rising, in our view,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, in a note. 
The world's second-largest economy is facing a series of headwinds in 2022, including property woes, a slowing manufacturing sector and COVID-19 outbreaks as the world battles the Omicron coronavirus variant.

Chinese cities are already advising people to stay put for the Lunar New Year, a peak travel period, due to fresh coronavirus outbreaks in several regions.

The producer price index rose 10.3% from a year earlier, down from November’s 12.9%, while the consumer price index increased 1.5%, compared with 2.3% in November. Both came in lower than economists’ expected.
The inflation surprise adds further impetus to calls for the central bank’s first cut in its key policy interest rate since April 2020, possibly as early as next week. Authorities have shifted to a more pro-growth bias this year as a property market slump and repeated virus outbreaks threaten the outlook.

The government took a number of measures recently to curb sharply rising energy and raw materials prices, with signs they could be having a desired effect. However, the emergence of omicron-variant virus cases is likely to be a defining factor in coming weeks, given that China is the world’s biggest producer and consumer of raw materials. If the outbreak continues to spread, some supply-side disruptions could ensue. 
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
The takeaway from the December retreat in China’s factory-gate and consumer price inflation: the central bank can rest easy if -- as we expect -- it adds more stimulus to support the economy. Producer price inflation eased for a second consecutive month, while consumer price inflation dropped back below 2%.

Consumer inflation remained subdued as virus control measures impeded consumption and weighed on demand, especially for prices of services. Core CPI rose 1.2%, the same as in November.
“The favorable inflation trend provides the time window for monetary easing. We expect the People’s Bank of China to cut the medium-term lending facility rate in the coming months,” said Zhaopeng Xing, an economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (OTC:ANZBY) Ltd.
China’s tech-heavy ChiNext Index rose as much as 2.2% after the inflation data was released, it’s steepest gain since Nov. 22. The gauge had been falling every day since the new year.
Food prices fell in December, with pork prices dropping almost 37% and vegetable price gains slowing. The spread of the more transmissible omicron variant threatens to temporarily drive prices up again if strict mobility restrictions are widened. The upcoming Lunar New Year holidays will also see a surge in demand for staple foods and thus higher prices.

The unemployment rate rose to 3.8% in December from 3.1% the previous month, above economists’ forecast for a reading of 3.2%. 
The figures come just days before the Bank of Korea meets to decide on policy, having raised interest rates twice since the summer. 
The strength of the country’s labor market in the face of a worsening virus situation will number among the factors the bank considers, with economists split on whether it will hike rates again at the meeting.
The Korean government tightened virus restrictions twice in December just after easing them the previous month, as Covid infections surged to record levels amid the spread of the variant. 
Governor Lee Ju-yeol has said that omicron is the biggest threat to the economy’s recovery. 
Still, a majority of economists expect the BOK to raise rates sooner or later this quarter as it seeks to limit the risk of financial imbalances and stem inflationary pressure.
With the BOK moving away from its pandemic stimulus settings, the renewed curbs and concern over the latest infection wave have prompted calls for an extra budget to keep the recovery on track by helping businesses and households.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers turned less positive about their business conditions in January, in a sign the economy faces pressure from the Omicron variant as well as rising energy and raw material costs, the Reuters Tankan poll showed.
Manufacturers and service sector firms were more optimistic about the coming three months, the monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's closely watched ""tankan"" quarterly survey, showed.
Some firms in the poll of 502 big and mid-sized companies, of which 254 responded, said their bottom lines were being pressured by commodity inflation, while others were more optimistic as they benefited from strong global demand.
""There's a demand rush before prices are raised,"" a manager at a metal products maker said in the Dec. 22-Jan. 7 poll.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers fell to 17 in January from 22 in December, slipping from the previous survey's four-month high, while the service index rose to a 23-month high of 8 from 6 in the prior month. (For a detailed table of the results, click)
The poll showed profit margins at some firms in the world's third-largest economy were taking a hit from higher raw material and energy prices, after the BOJ's latest ""tankan"" business survey showed a recovery among manufacturers had stalled.
""While demand conditions are good, soaring raw material and fuel prices are squeezing our profits,"" a manager at a glass and ceramics maker wrote in the survey.
""Margins are decreasing due to soaring raw material prices,"" a steel maker manager said.
The BOJ's tankan survey for October-December released last month showed the service-sector mood had improved to a two-year high, while the index gauging big manufacturers' sentiment was steady on the prior quarter.
Despite the impact from higher raw material prices, manufacturers' business confidence was expected to rise to 29 in April, in part due to strong forecasts for the metal products/machinery and carmaker sub-sectors, the Reuters Tankan poll showed.
The mood among service sector firms was expected to rise to 14, also up from its January level, though firms in the sector said they continued to feel the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, including the highly infectious Omicron variant.

Private-sector economists expect Japan's economy to grow in the current quarter and the final three months of last year, although the spread of the Omicron variant at home and globally as well as raw material inflation are clouding the outlook.
The Reuters Tankan index readings are calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A positive reading means optimists outnumber pessimists.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's annual inflation hit a six-year high of over 10% in 2021, government data showed on Tuesday, well above the central bank's year-end target range and raising pressure on policymakers for more aggressive interest rate hikes.
The benchmark IPCA consumer price index rose 10.06% last year, the highest annual rate since 2015, statistics agency IBGE said. The result was higher than the 9.97% median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
By law, central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto was obliged to write an open letter explaining why annual inflation had missed the official target range. It was the sixth such letter since the current inflation-targeting regime was created in 1999. The last time was in 2017. 
Campos Neto said steps have been taken to ensure inflation targets are met for 2022, 2023 and 2024, reaffirming the need to keep raising rates ""significantly into restrictive territory.""
The surge in inflation pushed Brazil's central bank into one of the most aggressive rate hike cycles in the world last year, raising its benchmark interest rate to 9.25% in December from 2% in March. 
Policymakers have already signaled another 150-basis-point increase in February and said the country's monetary tightening may last longer until inflation expectations are back on track, a message Campos Neto repeated in his letter.
Higher borrowing costs helped to tip Brazil into a recession last year, helping to cool inflation pressures in recent months.
The country's 12-month inflation rate eased in December from 10.74% in November, the first decline since May 2020.
Still, the full 2021 print missed both the central bank's annual target of 3.75% and the 5.25% top of its tolerance band.
The index rose 0.73% in December alone, IBGE said, above the 0.65% forecast in a Reuters poll, mostly driven by clothing prices, which rose 2.06%. 
Transport was mainly responsible for the sharp price increase in Latin America's largest economy last year, with annual gains of 21%. That was driven by a 49% annual spike in fuel prices. Housing costs had an annual rise of 13% with a 21% jump for electricity.
Campos Neto said inflation missed the target mostly due to rising prices of imports, especially oil, along with other commodities. A weaker currency also contributed to the impact, he said in his letter, due to fiscal concerns in the second half of the year.
Campos Neto also cited a spike in energy prices and global supply chain bottlenecks as inflation causes.

Analysts expect inflation and higher interest rates to drag on the economy in 2022, hurting household demand and discouraging corporate investments. 
The central bank's latest weekly survey of economists showed they lowered their forecasts for economic growth this year to just 0.28%, with expected inflation of 5.03% - again above the upper limit of the official inflation target of 3.50% for 2022, with a 1.5 percentage point margin of error on either side.

The prices hit a record high of $47,077 last month as new-vehicle inventory remained tight following healthy consumer demand, the report said. 
Sales of luxury vehicles, which comprised 18.4% of total sales in December, normally increase during the last two months of the year, pushing the average prices higher, according to the report.
The U.S. auto industry has been hit hard by the global semiconductor shortage and supply chain snarls, causing low inventory levels and skyrocketing prices amid strong consumer demand. 

For each of the last six months, the average price paid by consumers was above the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) as dealers continue to hold prices at or above MSRP, according to the auto consultant. 
Meanwhile, the average price for a new non-luxury vehicle was $43,072, slightly lower than the record high set in November.

By contrast, spending at hotels and restaurants dropped, the latter down by 14.1%.
A separate survey from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) showed retail sales values were 2.1% higher than a year earlier with food sales building on an already strong performance in December 2020. 
""More Brits were either isolating or choosing to stay at home due to the new variant, which hampered face-to-face retailers as well as hospitality and leisure outlets,"" said Jose Carvalho, head of consumer products at Barclaycard.
""However, there were some bright spots. Spending on essential items grew strongly as shoppers filled their trolleys with food and drink and celebrated the festive period with family and friends."" 
The BRC ranked clothes stores as the best performing category in December. Last week fashion chain Next raised its full-year profit outlook on the back of a strong Christmas period.
While retailers fared well in 2021 overall, the BRC warned that consumer spending was likely to be squeezed by fast-rising inflation, surging energy bills and tax increases. 

The Bank of England thinks consumer price inflation will hit about 6% in April, its highest in 30 years, and in the same month workers are due to see their social security contributions go up.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese households' inflation expectations have risen to a more than two-year high, a quarterly survey showed on Tuesday, a sign the rising cost of living was starting to change public perceptions about future price moves.
The result offers some hope for the Bank of Japan's effort to push inflation to its 2% target, partly by changing perceptions about persistent deflation, with aggressive monetary easing.
But analysts doubt whether recent increases in inflation, driven largely by rising fuel and raw material costs, could be sustained unless accompanied by higher wages.
The percentage of households that expect prices to be higher a year from now stood at 78.8%, up from 68.2% in September and hitting the highest level since September 2019, according to the BOJ survey conducted between Nov. 5 and Dec. 1.
Of the total, 80.8% said they expected prices to be higher five years from now, up from 78.1% in the previous survey and marking the highest level since December 2019.
The survey is among the data the BOJ will likely scrutinise at next week's policy meeting to judge whether rising input costs have affected households' inflation expectations.
Nearly nine years of ultra-easy policy have failed to fire up inflation to the BOJ's target as sluggish wage growth weighed on consumption, discouraging firms from increasing prices.
The hope among BOJ policymakers had been to shock the public out of a deflationary mindset with a massive dose of monetary stimulus.
While wholesale inflation hit a record 9.0% in November due to rising global commodity costs, core consumer inflation stood at just 0.5% due partly to the hit to consumption from the coronavirus pandemic.
Some analysts expect core consumer inflation to exceed 1.5% around April, as the drag from cellphone fee cuts last year tapers off and past rises in oil costs push up electricity bills.
Many BOJ policymakers view any such rise in inflation as unsustainable unless accompanied by steady wage gains, pointing to Japan's sticky deflationary sentiment.

Wage growth remains slow partly because Japanese firms do not need to lure back workers with higher pay, after having stuck to their tradition of keeping job cuts at a minimum even during last year's pandemic-induced economic slump.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said the central bank would keep monetary policy ultra-loose until 2% inflation is achieved, even as its counterparts such as the U.S. Federal Reserve eye an exit from crisis-mode stimulus measures.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retail sales surged past forecasts for a second month in November as consumers splashed out their pent up savings, a reminder of how well the economy was doing before an explosion of coronavirus cases cast a pall over Christmas.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Tuesday showed retail sales jumped 7.9% in November, adding to an already stellar 4.9% rise in October as much of the country emerged from a tough pandemic lockdown.
It blew away expectations of a 3.9% gain and left sales 5.8% up on November last year at a record A$33.41 billion ($24.00 billion), a major boost to economic growth in the quarter.
Pent-up demand combined with an extended November sales period to drive record sales in clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing, household goods and department stores.
""Consumers brought forward Christmas spending to take advantage of sales and minimise delivery and stock availability concerns ahead of the festive season,"" noted Ben James, the ABS' director of quarterly economy wide statistics.
Some slowdown had always been expected in December as increasingly popular Black Friday sales pulled spending forward into November, but the sudden emergence of the Omicron strain has proved a whole new burden for the sector.
Shops and restaurants have seen a self-imposed lockdown from consumers as cases ballooned to over 100,000 a day, while isolation rules for contacts has blown a hole in supply chains and emptied supermarket shelves.
Analysts at ANZ say spending on the banks' cards in the first week of January sank to its lowest since the Delta lockdowns, with Sydney and Melbourne particularly badly hit.
ANZ's latest survey of consumer sentiment out on Tuesday duly showed a 2.2% drop for last week as confidence in the economy slammed into reverse.
""The good news is that people are still relatively happy about their own financial circumstances,"" said ANZ's head of Australian economics David Plank. 
""This potentially sets things up for a rapid rebound once people are more confident about health outcomes.""
Households still have a huge buffer of savings amassed during the long lockdowns, while a strong labour market has kept people on jobs and earning a wage.
This is a major reason the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) had been optimistic the economy could weather the Omicron wage, though the speed of it spread has still surprised.
Australia is also benefiting from high prices for its major resource exports which has provided a timely windfall to company profits and government tax receipts.
Data from the ABS on Tuesday showed the country's trade surplus narrowed to A$9.4 billion in November, but only because the splurge in domestic spending sucked in more imports.

While exports rose 2% in the month, imports jumped 6% on gains in consumption and capital goods.

That will ease living difficulties for 13 million young people, Pan Wei, an official from the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development said at a news briefing in Beijing, according to an official transcript. 
China has stepped up efforts to address housing issues faced by young people particularly, amid soaring home prices in large cities, under President Xi Jinping's ""common prosperity"" plan.
The development push for affordable rental housing is focusing on cities with large population inflows and high home prices, Pan said.
Tier-one cities like Beijing and Shanghai will supply a total of 1.87 million units of low-cost rental housing in 2021-2025, according to Reuters' calculations based on plans published by cities.
In 2021, 936,000 units were offered in 40 cities, housing 2 million young people, said Pan.

China's property downturn is expected to continue in 2022, with monthly new home prices declining and a liquidity crisis that has engulfed some major property developers.
Chinese regulators are marginally easing curbs on the property sector to prevent a hard landing and to meet the demand from non-speculative home buyers.

The projected emissions increase shows the U.S. is now further off the target set by the Biden administration under the Paris climate agreement to slash emissions 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030. U.S. greenhouse gas emissions were 17.4% below 2005 levels in 2021, up from 22.2% below 2005 levels in 2020, according to the Rhodium Group, a research organization.
The group analyzed preliminary U.S. emissions data for 2021, a year that was supposed to be marked by recovery after the pandemic-related upheaval of the economy. It found that emissions growth outpaced the rate of economic recovery, using estimates that GDP grew by 5.7% year-on-year.
Driving the emissions growth were the transportation and electric power sectors, whose greenhouse gas emissions rose 10% and 6.6%, respectively in 2021, both rebounding around 2/3 of the drop from 2019 levels. 

In the power sector, high natural gas prices led to a 17% rise in coal generation - the first increase since 2014 - which drove up emissions.
The U.S. transportation sector, which accounts for nearly a third of net US emissions, saw the largest spike in emissions in 2021, a year after experiencing a 15% decline in 2020 from 2019 levels - the largest decline in greenhouse gas emissions led by a drastic drop in road travel due to the coronavirus.

637,"<span>Jan 10, 2022 08:36PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Australian household spending jumped in November as a combination of the easing of virus lockdowns and pre-Christmas purchases boosted outlays, suggesting the broader economy is likely to have rebounded solidly in the final three months of 2021. 
Retail sales soared 7.3% in the month after advancing 4.9% in October, easily outpacing economists’ expectations of a 3.6% gain, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed Tuesday. Sales soared a record 20% in Victoria, with the state’s lockdown having ended in late October, while New South Wales advanced 5.1% and the Australian Capital Territory jumped 19.2%, the report showed.
“Further easing of Covid-19 restrictions in the southeastern states and territories has seen the retail industry recover all lost momentum caused by the delta outbreak,” Ben James, director of Quarterly Economy Wide Statistics at the ABS, said in a statement. 
Economists expect spending to remain strong in the run up to the Christmas holiday period with median forecast for a brisk expansion in the the final quarter of 2021 for the $1.5 trillion economy. However, the outlook for early 2022 looks rocky as a surge in new coronavirus cases from the omicron variant is prompting caution among shoppers.
The ABS also released trade data Tuesday showing another solid surplus in November of A$9.4 billion ($6.8 billion), though narrower than the A$10.6 billion predicted by economists as a 6% increase in imports exceeded a 2% gain in exports. 
Today’s retail report  showed:
While the November increase in retail spending was the fourth largest in the series’ history, the Reserve Bank of Australia is likely to discount it somewhat given soaring coronavirus cases in Australia in recent weeks. The RBA holds its first meeting of 2022 on Feb. 1, when it’s due to decide on the future of its bond-buying program.
“For policy makers, this data would have been viewed favorably in the absence of the omicron spread,” said Callam Pickering, an economist at global jobs website Indeed Inc. “The economic environment though is moving too rapidly to put much weight on backwards looking measures of economic activity -- November feels like a lifetime ago.”

(Reuters) -Short-term inflation expectations held steady in December after rising steadily for more than a year and consumers became more optimistic about their job prospects, according to a survey released by the New York Federal Reserve on Monday. 
Median expectations for what inflation will be in one year were unchanged at 6.0% after 13 straight months of increases, according to the New York Fed's monthly survey of consumer expectations. Consumers' expectations of what inflation could be in three years also stayed steady at 4.0%, the survey showed. 
Consumers lowered their expectations for how much the prices of essential items will rise in the year ahead. They said they expect the price of gas to rise by 5.7% in a year, down from 9.2% in November, and for food prices to rise by 7.8%, down from 9.2%. 
Fed officials are considering whether they need to raise interest rates sooner than expected and may begin reducing their bond holdings later this year to respond to high inflation and a ""tight"" labor market, according to minutes from the Fed's Dec. 14-15 meeting released last week.

The New York Fed survey, which is based on a rotating panel of approximately 1,300 households, showed consumers are also more optimistic about the labor market. 
The perceived odds of losing a job over the next 12 months fell to an average 11.6% in December from 12.9% in November. And the average perceived chance of being able to find a new job after becoming unemployed rose to 57.5% in December from 55.9% in November – reaching the highest level since the pre-pandemic level of 58.7% in February 2020.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. wholesale inventories increased more than initially thought in November, suggesting that the restocking of warehouses likely contributed strongly to economic growth last quarter.
The almost broad increase in inventories reported by the Commerce Department on Monday also offered more hope that supply bottlenecks were easing. It followed in the wake of an Institute for Supply Management survey last week that showed improved supplier deliveries to factories in December.
""The fourth-quarter inventory build is shaping up to again be a strong contributor to topline GDP growth,"" said Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Indications that the worst of the global supply-chain problems are behind us have mounted in recent weeks.""
Wholesale inventories rose 1.4% in November, instead of 1.2% as estimated last month. Stocks at wholesalers increased 2.5% in October. Inventories are a key part of gross domestic product. 
There were big gains in motor vehicle, furniture, computer equipment, electrical and hardware stocks. Inventories of farm products, petroleum and alcohol fell. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected inventories would be unrevised. Wholesale inventories surged 15.9% in November from the year-earlier period. 
Motor vehicle inventories advanced 2.7% after rising 2.8% in October. The back-to-back increases suggested that the global shortage of semiconductors, which has constrained motor vehicle production, was abating. There are, however, worries that a global surge in COVID-19 cases, driven by the Omicron variant, could slow the untangling of supply chains.
Wholesale inventories, excluding autos, increased 1.2% in November. This component goes into the calculation of GDP. Economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) left their fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate unchanged at a 7.0% annualized rate. 
A slower pace of inventory drawdown in the third quarter accounted for the bulk of the 2.3% pace of increase in GDP growth for that period. Inventories were depleted through much of 2021, and coronavirus pandemic-related shortages are making it harder to replenish stocks.
The urgent need to restock is keeping manufacturing humming, but there are concerns among some economists that businesses wary of delays getting stock could order too much and end up with excess inventory, which could hurt the economic expansion.
""We've seen 16 consecutive inventory gains after 14 straight months without an increase,"" said Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colorado. ""We expect huge inventory additions of $136 billion in the fourth quarter and $99 billion in the first quarter.""

Sales at wholesalers increased 1.3% in November after accelerating by 2.5% in October. 
At November's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.22 months to clear shelves, unchanged from October.

Trade body Make UK and accountants PwC said 73% of manufacturers believed conditions for the sector would improve and 78% foresaw at least a moderate increase in productivity in 2022.
But two thirds of companies said Brexit had hampered their business in the nearly two years since Britain left the EU, while retaining staff and rising input costs linked to inflation also presented a challenge.
""It's testament to the strength of manufacturers that they have emerged from the turbulence of the last couple of years in such a relatively strong position,"" said Stephen Phipson, chief executive of Make UK. 
""To build on this we now need to see a government fully committed to supporting the sector,"" he said, adding that the government needed a longer-term vision for the economy.
Amid supply chain shortages linked to Brexit and the pandemic last year, more than a third of those surveyed said they would reshore some operations within the next two years, while just over half said they did not intend to move any of their production back to the United Kingdom.
The number of British manufacturers raising prices hit its highest in at least two decades last month, according to a similar survey, as the Bank of England raised interest rates to 0.25% to help head off inflationary pressure.
Official data showed British manufacturing output in October remained more than 2% below pre-pandemic levels.

Make UK forecast that manufacturing would grow 6.9% in 2021, and predicts growth of 3.3% for 2022.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's annual inflation rate hit 686.4% in 2021, demonstrating a deceleration of consumer price growth versus the previous year when inflation was 2,959.8%, the country's central bank said on Saturday. 
Monthly inflation in December rose 7.6% and, since September, the inflation rate has remained in the single digits.
The deceleration in prices follows government measures which include the restriction of credit and lower spending in bolivars to maintain the stability of the exchange rate.
As a result of this strategy, government entities and state-owned oil company PDVSA now pay suppliers in cash with foreign currency.
During an interview broadcast on state television at the start of this month, Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro said hyperinflation - which ran for four years - had been left behind.
Despite measures to improve supplies and control inflation, prices remain high and continue to hit the earnings of Venezuelan families, limiting their ability to buy goods like food and medicine. A minimum monthly salary is equivalent to $1.50. 

In 2019, amid hyperinflation and economic collapse, Venezuela's government relaxed economic controls, allowing greater quantities of foreign currency to circulate, which provided some sectors with breathing space. 
The central bank has yet to publish data regarding the country's economic growth.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment rose far less than expected in December amid worker shortages, and job gains could remain moderate in the near term as spiraling COVID-19 cases disrupt economic activity.
But the Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday suggested the jobs market was at or near maximum employment. The unemployment rate tumbled to a 22-month low of 3.9% from 4.2% in November. The second straight big monthly decline occurred even as more people entered the labor force. Wages increased solidly, underscoring labor market tightness.
""The U.S. labor market may have lost a little momentum at the end of a stellar year, largely due to the lack of available workers rather than available positions, but it is holding up nicely, at least so far,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. 
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 199,000 jobs last month, the survey of establishments showed. Data for November was revised up to show payrolls advancing by 249,000 jobs instead of the previously reported 210,000.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would rise by 400,000 and the unemployment rate to dip to 4.1%. 
A record 6.4 million jobs were created last year. This was the largest annual increase in employment since record-keeping started in 1939, a milestone cheered by President Joe Biden, who celebrates his first anniversary in the White House on Jan. 20.
""I would argue the Biden economic plan is working,"" Biden said at the White House. ""And it's getting America back to work, back on its feet."" 
Still, employment is 3.6 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. With the jobless rate flirting with the pre-pandemic low of 3.5% and falling below the Federal Reserve's longer-run estimate of 4.0%, some economists say the U.S. central bank could start raising interest rates in March.
""Most Fed officials will conclude that full employment has been reached, and we now expect liftoff in March and four hikes in 2022,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
Minutes of the Fed's Dec. 14-15 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed officials at the U.S. central bank viewed the labor market as ""very tight."" (Graphic: Non-farm payroll, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/UNEMPLOYMENT/zjpqkyjzbpx/chart.png) 
The underwhelming job growth in December likely reflects labor shortages as well as anomalies with the so-called seasonal adjustment, the model used by the government to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data. There were 10.6 million job openings at the end of November.
December is typically a weak month for payrolls growth. Unadjusted payrolls increased by 72,000. The seasonal factor added 127,000 jobs to the December tally, less than the 213,000 added in December 2020 and fewer than the roughly 425,000 average prior to the pandemic.
""The seasonal factor added about 300,000 less than in the pre-COVID years,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. macro strategist at TD Securities in New York. ""I'm not saying you necessarily should add 300,000, but it does look like a pretty extreme factor.""  
Employment was unlikely to have been impacted by surging infections driven by the Omicron variant of COVID-19. The government surveyed businesses and households for last month's report in mid-December just as Omicron was barreling across the country. The variant's hit to payrolls could be felt in January.
The average workweek was unchanged at 34.7 hours.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.
STRONG DETAILS
Job gains last month were led by the leisure and hospitality sector, which added 53,000 positions. Professional and business services payrolls rose by 43,000 jobs. Manufacturing added 26,000 jobs, while construction employment rose 22,000.
There were also gains in transportation and warehousing as well as wholesale trade and mining. Government employment fell by 12,000 jobs. Retail payrolls dropped as did those for utilities. (Graphic: Jobs by industry, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/INDUSTRY/qmypmdoolvr/chart.png) 
The United States reported nearly 1 million new coronavirus infections on Monday, the highest daily tally of any country in the world. Airlines have canceled thousands of flights and some school districts have suspended in-person learning. 
Some working parents may have to take on childcare duties, with the reversion to online learning. People who are out sick or in quarantine and do not get paid during the payrolls survey period are counted as unemployed even if they still have a job.
There are more signs of unemployed people stepping back into the labor market following the end of supplemental government-funded jobless benefits early in the fall. But the reentry could be slowed by soaring Omicron cases.
The survey of households, from which the unemployment rate is derived, showed 168,000 people entered the labor force. The workforce has now increased for a third straight month, though it remains 2.2 million jobs below its pre-pandemic level.
The household survey also showed an increase of 651,0000 in employment, which accounted for the three-tenths-of-a percentage-point drop in the unemployment rate. There were fewer people working part-time for economic reasons and there was a big drop in those reporting that they could not work because of the pandemic. (Graphic: Unemployment rate, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/UNEMPLOYMENT/gdpzymqoqvw/chart.png) 
Still, the labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, was unchanged at 61.9%. It remains well below the 63.4% rate before the pandemic. The employment-to-population ratio, viewed as a measure of an economy's ability to create employment, rose to 59.5% from 59.3% in November.

Tightening labor market conditions were highlighted by a solid 0.6% jump in average hourly earnings last month after a rise of 0.4% in November. The annual increase, however, fell to a still-high 4.7% from 5.1% in November. This is the result of last year's big gains falling out of the calculation.
Though inflation has outpaced wage gains, many consumers have continued to spend because of massive savings and increased job security, underpinning the economy. Growth last year is expected to have been the strongest since 1984.

Auto output in 2021 declined to 2,979,276 vehicles from 3,040,178 the year before, according to figures published by Mexico's national statistics agency (INEGI).

In December alone, production fell by 16.51% while exports plunged by 17.31%, marking the sixth straight month of declines.

A global semiconductor shortage in recent months has prompted automakers in Mexico and the rest of North America to implement rolling shutdowns, curtailing production.
In 2020, Mexico auto production tanked 20% compared with the prior year due to the pandemic's hit on the economy. Mexico's top autos association AMIA has estimated production won't return to pre-pandemic levels until late 2023 or in 2024.

646,"<span>Jan 07, 2022 09:20AM ET</span>",,,,,,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation rose unexpectedly last month, likely making for more uncomfortable reading at the European Central Bank, which has consistently underestimated price pressures and come under fire for this from some of its own policymakers.
Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose to 5% from 4.9% in November, a record high for the currency bloc and well ahead of analysts' expectation for 4.7%.
Energy prices, up 26% compared to a year earlier, remained the main driver but the increases for food, services and imported goods were also all well above the ECB's overall 2% inflation target, data from Eurostat showed on Friday.
With the economy roaring back to life from its initial pandemic shock last year, price growth took off, catching the ECB - which predicted just a benign inflation hump a few months ago - off guard.
Adding to the upward pressure, supply-chain bottlenecks curtailed the availability of consumer products, while households, forced into saving their cash for a year, started spending on everything from new cars to restaurant meals.
Most of these inflation drivers are temporary, so price pressures should ease eventually. 
But views diverge on how fast inflation will come down and where it is likely to settle once the economy adjusts to a new normal.
The ECB sees inflation back under 2% by the end of this year, but a long list of influential policymakers question this narrative, warning that risks are skewed towards higher figures and that above-target readings could persist into next year.
Part of the concern is that underlying prices - or inflation excluding volatile food and fuel prices - are also above target, suggesting that sectors prone to weak price pressures over the past decade are now adjusting.
Indeed, inflation excluding food and fuel prices, closely watched by the ECB, rose to 2.7% in December from 2.6%, while a narrower measure that also excludes alcohol and tobacco products held steady at 2.6%. Both figures were just above expectations.
Still, no policy action from the ECB is likely anytime soon.

The bank curbed but extended stimulus only a few weeks ago, so no big review of its stance is likely before March.
The ECB also argues that wage growth, a precondition of durable prices pressures, is anaemic, while the surge in coronavirus infections will likely curtain economic activity and weigh on inflation.

Investing.com -- The U.S. economy posted fewer jobs than expected for a second straight month in December, but the government's monthly report still pointed to ongoing inflationary pressures coming from the labor market.
The Labor Department said nonfarm employment rose by only 199,000 through the middle of the month. That's only half the expected 400,000 and a sharp contrast to the 807,000 gain in private payrolls reported in ADP's concurrent survey earlier in the week.  The disappointment was only partly mitigated by an upward revision of 39,000 to November's payrolls number.
However, there was still plenty of evidence that labor market tightness is feeding through into higher wages. Average hourly earnings rose 0.6% on the month, faster than November's rate of 0.4%, which was also revised higher. Analysts had forecast growth of 0.4%.  The unemployment rate, meanwhile, fell below 4% of the workforce for the first time since March 2020, and the broader U6 unemployment rate, which captures a broader range of underemployment, fell sharply to 7.3% from 7.7% a month earlier. 
""There are methodological issues with the establishment survey,"" said Marc Chandler, managing director of Bannockburn Global Forex via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""Seasonal patterns have been neutered by Covid and fewer companies (are) participating.""  
Chandler suggested that the Fed is focusing more on inflation than on jobs numbers right now, and that next week's data are likely to show another rise in inflation in December.
""The Fed is on course to hike earlier rather than later,"" tweeted Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) Macro Strategist Kit Juckes.
U.S. stock futures reacted negatively to the news, reversing tentative gains made in the overnight session on perceptions that the data will embolden the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy more and faster than thought earlier. By 8:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), Dow Jones Futures were down 58 points, or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was also down 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 Futures were down 0.6%. 
Other risk assets also suffered, with Bitcoin falling 4% to trade close to a four-month low of $41,206 that it hit earlier in the session. 
With the exception of the headline jobs number, the report broadly corroborates the picture painted earlier this week by other economic data that showed companies struggling to retain staff despite rapidly rising labor costs. The Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey showed employees quit their jobs at a record rate in November - with analysts surmising that those that departed went mostly to higher-paid jobs elsewhere. The Institute of Supply Management's non-manufacturing activity index, meanwhile, was skewed sharply higher by the prices subindex, which is closely correlated to labor costs.
The report also hinted at the ongoing structural labor market problems left behind by the pandemic, one of which has been the disproportionate pressure on women to drop out of the labor force due to school closures and childcare requirements (as well as the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on services, where female participation is higher than in manufacturing). Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist with  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW), noted that 152,000 men took jobs in the month, compared to only 66,000 women.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India cut its forecast for economic growth in the year to the end of March to 9.2% on Friday from an earlier outlook of more than 10%, as disruptions due to the Omicron variant of coronavirus hit consumer sentiment and economic activity.
The new forecast for real GDP in 2021/22 compares with a contraction of 7.3% in 2020/21 - the fastest expansion among the major economies, the Ministry of Statistics https://mospi.gov.in said when releasing its first advance estimates for national income.
The economy has been on the mend after the government lifted mobility curbs in June to curb the coronavirus. But after a surge in Omicron cases this week, many private economists have cut growth estimates to near 9% from over 10% estimates earlier.
Reserve Bank of India had earlier predicted a growth of 9.5%.
Vivek Rathi, director at consultancy Knight Frank India, said the third wave of the virus had impacted the estimates.
""We hope to have a softer landing from the third wave and continue economic momentum without severe disruptions.”
India's daily COVID-19 https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-new-covid-19-cases-hit-seven-month-high-117100-2022-01-07 cases jumped to 117,100 on Friday, a five-fold increase in a week and on course to overtake its previous infection peak as the fast-spreading Omicron variant replaces Delta in cities.
Manufacturing is now forecast to grow 12.5% this fiscal year compared with a 7.2% contraction in the previous year. Farm output may grow 3.9%, up from 3.6%.
Three waves of COVID-19 have pounded small businesses, and services like restaurants, tourism, educational institutions and retail, resulting in huge job losses.

The unemployment rate rose to four-month high of 7.9% in December, from 7% in the previous month, and number of those employed fell by 2.9 million from a year ago, data released by Mumbai-based think-tank Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) showed.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Euro zone economic sentiment dropped more than expected last month while inflation hit another record high, indicating the economy is under renewed stress as surging coronavirus infections force governments to tighten restrictions.
With infections breaking records almost daily as the Omicron variant sweeps across Europe, growth is likely to take a hit around the turn of the year even though governments have largely avoided the debilitating measures that brought their economies to a standstill a year ago.
Foreshadowing the pain, the European Commission's Economic Sentiment Indicator, a key gauge of the bloc's economic health, fell more sharply than forecast in December to a level last seen in May. The outlook for services worsened significantly and employment expectations also fell.
In Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy, the slowdown is already evident in hard data.
Supply chain bottlenecks have held back Germany's vast factory sector for most of the last quarter and industry, thought to be on the rebound, unexpectedly stumbled in November.
Output fell 0.2% on the month, despite expectations for a 1% rise, reinforcing views that Europe's biggest economy came to a halt in the fourth quarter of 2021, with no relief in sight for months.
""Unfortunately, this is where the rebound of German industry stops for the time being. The fourth wave of the pandemic and Omicron should send industrial activity back into hibernation,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.
""It will take until spring before German industry is back on a fully sustainable recovery path.""
In a rare bright spot for the bloc, retail trade unexpectedly rose in November, indicating that at least consumers remained optimistic going into the Christmas shopping season.
The problem is that heavy spending by households, who were forced to save up cash for the past year amid restrictions, is pushing consumer prices to new records.
Inflation unexpectedly hit 5% last month, a record high for the 19-country currency bloc and uncomfortable reading at the European Central Bank, which has consistently underestimated price pressures.
When the economy rebounded from its initial pandemic shock last year price growth took off, primarily as oil and gas prices jumped.
Adding to the upward pressure, supply-chain bottlenecks curtailed the availability of consumer products, while households, digging into the cash they had piled up, started spending on everything from new cars to restaurant meals.
While most of these inflation drivers are temporary, many, including some influential policymakers, doubt the ECB's benign narrative that price growth will be back under its 2% target by the end of the year.
Part of their concern is that rises in underlying prices - or inflation excluding volatile food and fuel prices - are also above target, suggesting that sectors prone to weak inflation over the past decade are now adjusting.

Still, with stimulus extended only a few weeks ago, the ECB is unlikely to revisit its policy stance until March, especially as Omicron clouds the outlook. 
There was a glimmer of good news for the central bank in the Commission's sentiment survey with euro zone entrepreneurs paring back their expectations for price rises for the first time in more than a year last month.

Retail sales, a proxy for consumer demand, in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 1% by value on the month, defying expectations for a 0.5% drop in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Compared to a year earlier, retail sales expanded by 7.8%, well ahead of projections for 5.6%, the European Union's statistics agency said.

Non-food sales rose by 1.6% on the month while car fuel sales fell by 1.5%, reversing their earlier trend.

The deficit surged to 9.727 billion euros ($10.99 billion)from 7.697 billion a month earlier with the value of imports reaching an all-time high of 52.5 billion euros versus 51.3 billion in October, the customs office said.
Like many countries around the world, France has been in the grip of an energy crisis since last year, when the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions put huge demands on depleted stocks of natural gas, sending prices of gas, related commodities and carbon emission permits to their highest in years.
Surging energy prices have added to underlying weakness in the French economy, whose trade balance has been in the red since 2004 as the country's industrial sector declined.
While President Emmanuel Macron's government has sought to reverse the trend, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said that improving the trade balance should be one of the major economic priorities for the next government after presidential elections in April.
""The weakness of our foreign trade reflects the weakness of our domestic economy. There is not great nation with a foreign (trade) balance that remains in deficit,"" Le Maire said.
In a case in point, other official data showed a 0.4% decline in French industrial output in November versus October, confounding a median forecast by economists for a 0.5% increase.

Meanwhile, consumer spending, at +0.8%, was a little higher than the +0.5% forecast in November, data published on Friday from the INSEE stats office showed.

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to a three-month low of 54.3 in December from 55.5 in November. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 54.0.
Civil engineering activity declined for the first time since February and growth in the commercial sector slowed. Only housebuilding saw a pickup in December, the survey showed.
Many survey respondents cited disruption arising from COVID-19 cases, which hit new records last month as the Omicron variant spread rapidly.
""UK construction companies ended last year on a slightly weaker footing as renewed pandemic restrictions held back the recovery, especially in commercial and civil engineering work,"" said Tim Moore, director at IHS Markit.
Like the PMIs published earlier this week for the manufacturing and services sectors, the construction survey showed an easing in very high cost pressures faced by companies. 
The survey's gauge of supplier delivery times rose to its highest level since November 2020, signalling reduced disruption to supply chains.

""The worst phase of supplier delays seems to have passed as the availability of construction products and materials continued to turn a corner in December,"" Moore said.
The all-sector PMI, which combines the construction, manufacturing and services readings over the week, fell to 53.6 in December from 57.4 in November, its lowest since February and a drop largely reflecting the hit to consumer-facing businesses from Omicron's spread.

Seasonally adjusted exports increased by 1.7%, the Federal Statistics Office said.
Imports rose 3.3% after a slightly revised rise of 5.2% in the prior month. The trade surplus decreased to 10.9 billion euros ($12.3 billion) from 12.4 billion euros the previous month.
A Reuters poll had pointed to a 0.2% decrease in exports and a 1.7% decrease in imports.

""Industrial production, however, struggled to keep up. Unfortunately, this is where the rebound of German industry stops for the time being. The fourth wave of the pandemic and Omicron should send industrial activity back into hibernation.""

House prices rose by 1.1% in December alone, the same increase as in November, and recorded their biggest quarterly rise since November 2006.
Britain is not alone among rich economies in seeing a sharp rise in house prices during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite a historic slump in economic output from which it has not yet recovered.
Halifax said multiple factors had encouraged people in Britain to buy a new home, including greater demand for space for homeworking, a shortage of other spending opportunities and a tax break on purchases which expired at the end of September.
""A lack of available homes for sale, and historically low mortgage rates, have also helped drive annual house price inflation,"" Halifax managing director Russell Galley said.

House prices were likely to rise much more slowly in 2022 than in the previous two years, reflecting the prospect of higher interest rates and a squeeze on disposable income from increased consumer price inflation, he added.
Wales reported the biggest annual increase in house prices, with a 14.5% rise in the year to December, while London was the weakest-performing part of the United Kingdom with an increase of just 2.1%.

The corporate goods price index (CGPI), a gauge of the prices companies charge each other for their goods, in December likely rose 8.8% from a year earlier, the poll of 17 economists showed.
That would follow a record 9.0% year-on-year gain in November, the fastest pace since comparable data became available in 1981.
Month-on-month, the wholesale price index is expected to have increased 0.3% in December, slightly slowing from 0.6% growth in the prior month, the poll showed.
""Import (cost) inflation apparently took a break, as the forex rate in December showed a slightly stronger yen compared to November, and the rise in oil prices halted,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. 
""Nevertheless, domestically, the trend of passing higher costs to final goods prices has been going on.""
The combination of a weak yen and global commodity inflation has gradually pushed up Japan's consumer prices as well, but at a more moderate pace than wholesale inflation. The core consumer price index, the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) benchmark reading, rose 0.5% year-on-year in November, marking a near 2-year-high.
The central bank, however, made no changes to its ultra-easy policies at its December rate review except for a partial scale-down of the pandemic funding programme, as inflation remains below its 2% target.
The BOJ is due to release the CGPI data on Jan. 14 at 8:50 a.m. (Jan. 13, 2350 GMT).
Other data due next week is expected to show Japan's current account posting a 585 billion yen ($5.05 billion) surplus in November, shrinking from a 1.18 trillion yen surplus in the previous month, as record-size imports due to soaring fuel prices swelled the trade deficit.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending posted an annual drop for the fourth straight month in November, a weaker-than-expected reading that threw into doubt hopes that a consumer demand recovery will give a major boost to the economy in the final quarter of 2021.
Household spending fell 1.3% in November from a year earlier, government data showed, a surprisingly weak outcome compared with the market forecast of a 1.6% gain in a Reuters poll and dropping at a faster pace than October's 0.6% decline.
The month-on-month figures were also negative, losing 1.2%, weaker than a forecast of a 1.2% gain as households remained hesitant to increase spending despite lower COVID-19 infections than during the summer months.
""Coronavirus infections had already come down, so this suggests consumers remain cautious about the outlook,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
The weak figures raise some concerns for policymakers hoping a rebound in consumer demand will support the economy as companies struggle with higher import cost due to a rise of raw material prices that have fuelled global inflation.
Consumer spending, however, was still expected to stage a fourth-quarter rebound after the heavy hit they took in the quarter before it, said Tsunoda.
""There will be sharp growth, but private consumption won't recover to pre-pandemic levels as it will be coming from a low base,"" he said.
Declining spending on overnight stays and eating out weighed on the headline figure, a government official said, adding those items got a boost from a campaign last year to stimulate domestic tourism and dining out.
Spending on clothes and transportation increased compared to a year earlier, the data showed. 
Separate data on Friday showed core consumer prices in Tokyo rose at the fastest pace in nearly two years in December as electricity and fuel cost surged due to higher global energy prices, while prices of overnight stays also increased.
The core consumer price index (CPI) for Japan's capital, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, rose 0.5% in December compared with a year earlier, the biggest year-on-year gain since February 2020, government data showed.

Inflation-adjusted real wages, meanwhile, slumped 1.6% year-on-year in November, falling for the third straight month and boding ill for a stronger economic recovery.
Japan's economy is expected to have grown sharply in the October-December quarter of 2021 after coronavirus cases declined, though the increasing cost of goods and the recent spread of the highly infectious Omicron variant are sowing some doubts for the outlook. 
 
"
658,"<span>Jan 06, 2022 07:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Japanese household spending fell in November for the first time in three months, a sign of unexpected fragility in consumption even before the omicron variant of the virus started to spread.
Spending declined 1.2% from the prior month, led by drops in outlays on housing and education, the ministry of internal affairs reported Friday. Overall expenditures were 1.3% below 2020’s level, compared with economist’s expectations for a 1.2% increase.
Separate reports showed Tokyo inflation rose 0.5% last month from a year ago, the highest level since February 2020. Wages were flat in November, showing how much work Prime Minister Fumio Kishida must do to stoke the pay hikes he’s called for as a centerpiece of his economic agenda.
Consumers showed less appetite for spending in November even as vaccination rates climbed and Covid cases became more rare during the second full month since emergency virus restrictions were lifted. 
The spread of the omicron variant, which has pushed case numbers back to levels not seen since late summer, could further damp the recovery if it triggers another emergency declaration, though the odds of that are still low. 
Analysts have been forecasting consumption helping the economy return to growth last quarter, with a stimulus package from the Kishida administration expected to add support this year. 
Tokyo raised its alert level one notch this week, but the governor said there are no plans at this point to ask the national government to introduce a quasi-emergency in the capital, where 641 cases were discovered Thursday, around 10 times more than a week earlier.
Tokyo Governor Says She Won’t Seek Virus Restrictions for Now
Meanwhile, higher energy prices and import costs on the back of a weaker yen continue to push Japanese inflation higher. At a policy meeting this month, the Bank of Japan will likely discuss the possibility of ditching of a long-held view that price risks are mainly on the downward side, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Any shift in the risk assessment of prices won’t be a signal that the BOJ is moving toward policy normalization since inflation is still far from the bank’s 2% target in stark contrast with many of its global peers, the people said.  
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“We expect pent-up demand to spur spending into 1Q 2022 with wide vaccination coverage and a relatively low number of virus infections. Fiscal stimulus -- including wage support measures and cash and coupon payouts to low-income households -- has been supporting consumer sentiment.”

Japanese policy makers have repeatedly said that higher wages hold the key to whether the economy reaches a more sustainable path, where consumers tolerate higher prices, profits increase and growth quickens.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 207,000 for the week ended Jan. 1, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims dropped to 200,000 in the prior week.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 197,000 applications for the latest week. Applications typically increase during the holiday season, but an acute shortage of workers has disrupted that seasonal pattern, resulting in lower seasonally adjusted claims numbers in recent weeks. There were 10.6 million job openings at the end of November.
""Some businesses temporarily close around the holiday season, causing an increase in filings for unemployment benefits,"" Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""As worker shortages have been a persistent issue and employment levels are already lower than desired, this effect has been much less during the recent holiday season."" 
Stripping out the weekly volatility, the labor market is tightening, with claims having declined from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020. 
Minutes of the Federal Reserve's Dec. 14-15 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed Fed officials viewed the labor market as ""very tight."" The U.S. central bank might need to raise interest rates sooner than expected and begin reducing its overall asset holdings to tame high inflation, according to the minutes.
But with the United States reporting nearly 1 million new coronavirus infections on Monday, the highest daily tally of any country in the world, a temporary rise in claims is likely. 
Some school districts are suspending in-person learning, which could force some working parents to assume childcare duties. Workers calling in sick are causing some businesses to either temporarily close or scale back services.
A separate report on Thursday from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers increased 28.1% to 19,052 in December. Layoffs, however, remain low, totaling 321,970 jobs in 2021. That was down 86% from 2020.
""The sheer number of COVID cases will impact the labor market, regardless of how severe illnesses are,"" said 
Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas. ""Those with COVID safety concerns will continue to shun in-person roles."" 
The claims data has no bearing on the Labor Department's closely watched employment report for December, due to be released on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period. The government surveyed businesses and households for last month's employment report in mid-December.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 400,000 jobs in December after rising 210,000 in November. The unemployment rate is forecast falling to 4.1% from 4.2% in November. 

Prospects of a strong employment report were boosted by the ADP National employment report on Wednesday, which showed private payrolls increased by 807,00 jobs last month. That prompted economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to raise their December payrolls estimate by 50,000 to 500,000. 
A measure of manufacturing employment rose to an eight-month high in December, a survey from the Institute for Supply Management showed on Tuesday.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada posted a trade surplus of C$3.13 billion ($2.45 billion) in November, the largest in over 13 years, with record exports offsetting the impact of floods in British Columbia, Statistics Canada said on Thursday.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a November surplus of C$2.03 billion. Exports and imports hit all-time highs for the second month in a row, pushing the surplus to a level not seen since the C$3.45 billion posted in September 2008.
Peter Hall, chief economist at Canada's export development agency, said the data showed how much global production had recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The economy has come roaring back much more quickly and much more decidedly than anybody expected or was prepared for,"" he said by phone, noting that energy exports had posted a 2.8% gain. Canada is a major exporter of crude and natural gas.
Overall exports rose by 3.8% from October, helping outweigh the impact of massive floods and landslides in British Columbia last November that temporarily cut most links to Vancouver, the country's largest port. 
""This suggests there are modest upside risks to the preliminary estimate that GDP rose by 0.3% month on month in November,"" Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.
Statscan said the data had been inflated by unusually high pharmaceutical shipments. In November, Canada imported COVID-19 medication for packaging and labeling and then exported it.
But even when pharmaceuticals were stripped out, overall exports still grew by 2.8% from October. Imports grew by 2.4% but that shrank to 0.1% excluding pharmaceuticals.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders advancing 1.5%. Orders increased 12.9% on a year-on-year basis.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, is being supported by businesses replenishing depleted inventories.
There were increases in orders for computers and electronic products as well as transportation equipment. But orders for machinery fell as did those for electrical equipment, appliances and components.
There are tentative signs that raw material and labor shortages are starting to abate. An Institute for Supply Management survey on Tuesday showed its measure of prices paid for inputs by factories fell by the most in a decade in December.
Shipments of manufactured goods increased 0.7% in November after surging 2.0% in October. Inventories at factories rose 0.7%. Unfilled orders increased 0.7% after gaining 0.3% in the prior month.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's services sector suffered its biggest loss of momentum last month since the country was last in lockdown, as the spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus hammered hospitality and travel, a survey showed on Thursday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to a 10-month low of 53.6 in December from 58.5 in November, according to final data, which was a fraction stronger than a preliminary ""flash"" reading of 53.2.
The composite PMI, which includes Tuesday's more upbeat manufacturing PMI, showed a similar move.
""Mass cancellations of bookings in response to the Omicron variant led to a slump in consumer spending on travel, leisure and entertainment,"" IHS Markit economist Tim Moore said.
Some 45% of hospitality businesses and 50% of firms such as beauticians and hairdressers reported increased cancellations in the run-up to Christmas, according to separate figures released by the Office for National Statistics on Thursday.
The last time the services PMI was lower was in February 2020 when the economy was still under lockdown, and restaurants and non-essential shops were closed to the public. 
December's data was above the 50 mark that normally separates growth from contraction, but economists said the scale of the fall increased the chances that official data due next month would show the economy shrank in December.
""Disruption from the current scale of infections risks worsening supply bottlenecks, particularly labour shortages. And combined with a deterioration in high-frequency indicators, the latest PMIs reinforce the likelihood that GDP fell in December,"" said Martin Beck, chief economic adviser to EY ITEM Club.
Pantheon Economics forecasts a 0.6% fall in GDP for December and a 0.3% decline for January.
""That said, we can't rule out a rise in GDP in January if consumers feel more confident to risk contracting COVID-19, now that Christmas is out of the way and people know that Omicron is less likely to result in serious illness than Delta,"" said Gabriella Dickens, senior UK economist at Pantheon.
NO NEW LOCKDOWN
Unlike during the wave of COVID-19 cases last winter - when few Britons had been vaccinated - this year Prime Minister Boris Johnson has rejected new legal restrictions in England, although curbs on hospitality apply elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
Moreover, many Britons have also followed health advice to work from home where possible and limit social gatherings. Retail footfall in the week to Jan. 2 was 25% lower than its level in the equivalent week of 2019, the ONS said.
Services businesses were more upbeat for 2022 as a whole, however, with 55% expecting output to rise compared with 10% predicting a decline, IHS Markit said.
But many economists expect a big squeeze on consumer demand this year from sharply rising inflation, which the Bank of England forecasts will peak at a 30-year high of around 6% in April, just as the government raises taxes on workers.
The BoE also started last month to raise interest rates from their record-low 0.1% to tackle longer-term price pressures.

""Many businesses cited the need to pass on escalating costs to clients over the course of 2022,"" Moore said, adding that firms faced pressure to raise pay in a competitive job market.
Both the 'prices charged' and the input costs components of the services PMI in December were well above their levels at the start of 2021, although down from peaks a few months earlier.

The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 125.7 points in 2021, the highest since 131.9 in 2011.
The monthly index eased slightly in December but had climbed for the previous four months in a row, reflecting harvest setbacks and strong demand over the past year. [GRA/]
Higher food prices have contributed to a broader surge in inflation as economies recover from the coronavirus crisis and the FAO has warned that the higher costs are putting poorer populations at risk in countries reliant on imports.
In its latest update, the food agency was cautious about whether price pressures might abate this year.
""While normally high prices are expected to give way to increased production, the high cost of inputs, ongoing global pandemic and ever more uncertain climatic conditions leave little room for optimism about a return to more stable market conditions even in 2022,"" FAO senior economist Abdolreza Abbassian said in a statement.
A surge in the price of fertilisers, linked in turn to spiralling energy prices, has ramped up the cost of so-called inputs used by farmers to produce crops, raising doubts over yield prospects for next year's harvests.
In December, prices for all categories in the food price index bar dairy products fell, with vegetable oils and sugar falling significantly, the agency said in its monthly update. 
It cited a lull in demand during the month, concerns about the impact of the Omicron coronavirus variant, and supplies from southern hemisphere wheat harvests for the declines.
However, all categories in the index showed sharp increases during 2021 as a whole and the FAO's vegetable oil price index hit a record high.

Crop futures have seen volatile trading at the start of 2022, with oilseed markets stirred by drought in South America and floods in Malaysia. [POI/]
Dairy prices maintained their recent strength in December, helped by lower milk production in Western Europe and Oceania, the FAO said.

Investing.com – China’s services sector activities grew faster in December thanks to rising demand and easing inflation. However, ongoing, small-scale COVID-19 outbreaks throughout the country weighed on the market.
China Caixin services purchasing managers’ index (PMI), which focuses on small companies in coastal regions, rose to 53.1 in December from 52.1 in November. 
Some analysts said the economic recovery from COVID-19 to be slower in the services sector, which is more easily affected by the COVID-19 outbreaks and resultant restrictive measures. Leisure and tourism businesses have specially been hit hard.
The northwestern city of Xi’an saw an outbreak of COVID-19 and has been in lockdown since Dec. 22, 2021.
The Caixin survey also showed that though rising slower, companies’ input prices rose for the eighteenth month in a row. A sub-index for employment rose at the fastest pace since May.
""Supply and demand both improved. As new products helped lift the market sentiment, business activity, and total new business both expanded for the fourth consecutive month. But surveyed enterprises were concerned about the disruptions caused by scattered COVID-19 flare-ups,"" Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in a note accompanying the data.
“Although the measure for business expectations remained in positive territory, it fell to the lowest since September 2020 and was remarkably lower than the long-term average.”
Meanwhile, data released earlier in the week showed that the Caixin manufacturing PMI was 50.9. Official data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that the non-manufacturing PMI was 52.7, while the manufacturing PMI was 50.3, in December.",,,,,

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 53.1 in December from 52.1 in November, remaining above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The survey, which focuses more on small firms in coastal regions, tallied with those of an official survey, which also showed the expansion in the services sector sped up.
Analysts say the services sector, which has been slower to recover from the pandemic than manufacturing, is more vulnerable to sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks and anti-virus measures, with leisure and tourism businesses hurt the most.
Most of China's recent local cases have been in the northwestern province of Shaanxi, where the capital city Xian has been on lockdown to control the spread of the disease.
Firms' input prices rose for the 18th month in a row, but at a slower pace, the survey showed. A sub-index for employment rose at the fastest pace since May, and a gauge of new business accelerated.

Mexico sold 1,014,680 light vehicles last year, according to figures from the national statistics agency (INEGI) after sales fell 27.9% to 950,063 in 2020, a nine-year low. There were 1.3 million vehicles sold in 2019 before the pandemic while 2016 saw a record 1.6 million sales.
Fausto Cuevas, head of the Mexican Automotive Industry Association (AMIA), recently forecast Mexico's auto production would only return to pre-pandemic levels in late 2023 or in 2024.
Car production has been hobbled in recent months by a global semiconductor shortage, prompting automakers across North America to implement rolling shutdowns and curb output.

The bottlenecks hit the industry in the second half of last year and during the October-December period, sales were the weakest they had been in the fourth quarter since 2010.
Semiconductors are an indispensable component for the automakers, who need them for a wide variety of systems such as safety, navigation and entertainment. COVID-19 outbreaks in Asian semiconductor manufacturing hubs have slowed production.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in December, pointing to underlying labor market strength, but skyrocketing COVID-19 infections could slow momentum in the months ahead.
The surge in private hiring in the ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday was based on data collected in mid-December just as the Omicron variant was sweeping across the country, causing some events and hundreds of flights to be canceled.
""The labor market continues to recover,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""However, the Omicron variant is a substantial downside risk to the near-term labor market recovery."" 
Private payrolls jumped by 807,000 jobs last month, the most in seven months, after rising by 505,000 in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would increase by 400,000 jobs.
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics and was published ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive and closely watched employment report for December on Friday. It has, however, a poor record predicting the private payrolls count in the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics employment report because of methodology differences.
Graphic - U.S. private sector hiring: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/mopanwjwnva/chart_eikon.jpg
Economists anticipate some disruption from the winter wave of infections, though not on the scale of last summer. The hit to the labor market is expected to show in the January data. 
The United States reported nearly 1 million new coronavirus infections on Monday, the highest daily tally of any country in the world. 
Airlines have canceled flights and some school districts have suspended in-person learning as workers called in sick. 
""Most of those absentees will still be paid and therefore counted as employed this month,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""But a significant minority who do not have access to paid sick leave will not, potentially knocking hundreds of thousands off the official non-farm payrolls tally in January.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading mixed. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. Yields on shorter-dated U.S. Treasuries rose.
BROAD INCREASE
Still, demand for labor is strong amid an acute shortage of workers. The broad increase in private hiring last month was led by a rise of 246,000 in the leisure and hospitality industry. Professional and business services added 130,000 jobs.
Manufacturing hired 74,000 more workers and construction payrolls increased by 62,000 jobs. Hiring at construction sites is being supported by a strong housing market, though rising mortgage rates could slow demand.
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a home declined over the past two weeks. Though the data can be volatile around holidays, it was in line with other indicators that have suggested the housing market could be losing steam. Contracts to purchase a previously owned home fell in November. 
Despite the ADP report's spotty track record in predicting the private payrolls component of the Labor Department's monthly employment release, last month's jump was another sign that job growth probably accelerated in December. 
The government also surveyed businesses and households for last month's employment report in mid-December.
Economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) raised their December payrolls estimate by 50,000 to 500,000 after the ADP release. 
""But the ADP report is at least broadly supportive of our view that the labor market is continuing to tighten despite the recent COVID spread and some signs that consumer activity has weakened lately,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
First-time applications for unemployment benefits declined significantly between mid-November and mid-December. The Institute for Supply Management's measure of factory employment rose to an eight-month high in December, with manufacturers noting an improvement in labor supply.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, private payrolls likely increased by 365,000 jobs in December. Overall nonfarm payrolls are forecast to rise by 400,000 jobs. The economy created 210,000 jobs in November. 

But worker shortages are constraining the labor market's recovery. The government reported on Tuesday that there were 10.6 million job openings at the end of November. 
There were signs in November that unemployed Americans were starting to slowly return to the workforce, but the rising coronavirus infections could force some to stay home.

671,"<span>Jan 05, 2022 08:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. companies in December added the most jobs in seven months, indicating that more Americans are returning to the labor force and helping employers to fill a near-record number of open positions. 
Businesses’ payrolls grew by 807,000 last month, after a downwardly revised 505,000 gain in November, according to ADP Research Institute data released Wednesday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 410,000 rise.
“Job gains were broad-based, as goods producers added the strongest reading of the year, while service providers dominated growth,” ADP Chief Economist Nela Richardson said in a statement.
The larger-than-expected payrolls gain could indicate that employers had more success hiring in December as higher wages and attractive working terms lured people off the sidelines. Even so, a surge in Covid-19 infections in recent weeks could impact hiring if more Americans pull back on activities like travel and restaurant dining and businesses struggle to stay open.
The data precede Friday’s monthly jobs report from the Labor Department, which is currently forecast to show that the U.S. added 384,000 private payrolls in December. ADP’s data don’t always align with those of the government because of different measurement techniques.
Strength in Services
Service-provider employment rose by 669,000 in December, the most since June, led by leisure and hospitality.
Payrolls at goods producers increased 138,000, the strongest since September 2020.
Companies with more than 500 workers added 389,000, the most jobs since June 2020. Small businesses posted a gain of 204,000 in December, which was the most in six months.

The amount spent on food, which benefited from a closure of restaurants last year and limited competition from cross-border shopping in cheaper countries, such as Germany and France, is expected to decline by 5.5%.
Non-food shopping is expected to drop by 2.8% in 2022, Credit Suisse said in its retail outlook report, one of the first forward-looking economic analyses of the year.
Still, after a 2.4% increase in overall retail spending in 2021, Swiss shops should still do better than during the pre-pandemic year of 2019, the authors of the study said. 
They forecast food retailing 4.5% above 2019 levels and non-food retail 2.1% higher.
""We expect a decline from 2021 levels this year as many of the positive factors which drove sales will be absent,"" said Credit Suisse economist Tiziana Hunziker.
""Last year people bought long-lasting goods like computers, skis or furniture, while in other areas like DIY and hobby products people have stocked up,"" she added. ""Still, I think we will be above pre-crisis levels.""
Estimates indicate that in 2020 retail revenues totalled about 99 billion Swiss francs ($108.17 billion) and last year have likely surpassed the 100 billion franc level for the first time.
Retail consultant Martin Hotz said while the food sector had a good 2021, other areas like shoes and fashion were nervous and looking to cut costs.
Swiss retail sales were 1.2% higher in October compared with the same month a year earlier.. November figures are due on Jan. 7.

Neighbouring Germany on Tuesday reported its retail sales rose unexpectedly in November despite renewed COVID-19 restrictions.

LONDON (Reuters) -The euro zone's economic recovery stuttered in December as a renewed wave of COVID-19 infections curtailed growth in the bloc's dominant service industry, a survey showed on Wednesday, and could weaken further if tighter restrictions are imposed.
As the Omicron coronavirus variant spread rapidly at the end of last year governments reimposed measures to contain infection rates, particularly in Germany, Europe's largest economy.
That meant IHS Markit's Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a good gauge of overall economic health, sank to 53.3 in December from 55.4 in November, its lowest since March.
While the final reading was below an earlier 53.4 ""flash"" estimate it did hold above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
""The final Composite PMIs for December confirm that the euro zone economy ended 2021 on a weak note. The economy lost momentum at the end of last year but still appeared to be expanding,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds at Capital Economics.
Restrictions to contain the coronavirus dampened activity in Germany's https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/covid-curbs-dampen-activity-german-services-sector-dec-pmi-2022-01-05 services sector and concerns over the Omicron variant clouded the outlook for January, while in France https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/french-services-growth-december-slightly-below-initial-reading-pmi-2022-01-05 growth came in slightly below an initial estimate as the pandemic weighed.
Consumer confidence in France - the bloc's second-biggest economy - nevertheless improved last month.
With customers encouraged to stay at home the euro zone's services industry saw growth wane. Its PMI dropped to an eight-month low of 53.1 from November's 55.9, below a 53.3 preliminary reading.
Weaker demand and the threat of further restrictions on the horizon meant services firms increased headcount at the slowest pace since May. The employment index fell to 53.6 from 55.4.
A factory PMI https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/euro-zone-factory-growth-stayed-strong-dec-supply-issues-eased-pmi-2022-01-03 released on Monday, which showed manufacturing activity remained resilient in December, suggested an easing of supply chain bottlenecks had alleviated some price pressures.

But the composite input prices index stayed high at 74.1, albeit below November's 76.0. The output prices index fell but remained elevated.
The European Central Bank https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/ecb-set-dial-back-stimulus-one-more-notch-2021-12-15 raised its inflation projections last month and now sees inflation at 3.2% this year, well above its 2.0% target.

IHS Markit's Business Activity Index for services stood at 53.0 in December, down from 55.9 in November but comfortably above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction for an eighth successive month.
The figure was below the median forecast in a Reuters survey of seven analysts which had pointed to a reading of 53.9.
Italy's service sector took longer to recover from COVID-19 lockdowns than the smaller manufacturing sector, which has seen healthy growth for the last year and recorded its 18th consecutive month of expansion in December.
Factories, unlike many services businesses, remained open during most of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The sub-index for new business in the service sector came in at 55.4 in December from 56.3 the month before.

The composite Purchasing Managers' Index for services and manufacturing remained robust in December at 54.7, down from 57.6 posted in November but its 11th successive month of growth.

Ads were still up 32.7% on a year earlier at 212,098 and 4.2% higher than June 2021 when the Delta variant first hit.
ANZ senior economist Catherine Birch noted a huge 366,100 surge in employment reported during November suggested some outstanding positions were filled and was partly behind the drop in ads.
""But it's also possible that businesses have become more hesitant to hire due to the spread of Omicron and the consequent uncertainty around consumer behaviour and worker availability,"" she added.
New coronavirus cases began to take off in late December and are now hitting records daily.
Birch said surveys also suggested more workers were looking to switch jobs this year.

""With so much competition for labour and workers feeling secure in their jobs, we should see more people moving to better jobs and asking for larger pay rises in 2022, contributing to stronger wages growth,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity slowed in December amid a cooling in demand for goods, but supply constraints are starting to ease and a measure of prices paid for inputs by factories fell by the most in a decade.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey on Tuesday also suggested some improvement in labor supply, with a gauge of factory employment rising to an eight-month high. Still, Timothy Fiore, chair of the ISM manufacturing business survey committee, noted that ""shortages of critical lowest-tier materials, high commodity prices and difficulties in transporting products continue to plague reliable consumption."" 
The survey does not fully capture the impact of the Omicron COVID-19 variant, which is rapidly spreading across the United States and abroad. Sky-rocketing infections could force workers to stay home and halt the tentative supply-chain progress.
""There's still a lot of ground to make up before supply chains fully normalize, but cooling prices and increased employment are positive signs,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York.
The ISM's index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 58.7 last month, the lowest level since January 2021, from 61.1 in November. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would fall to 60.1. 
All of the six biggest manufacturing industries - chemical products, fabricated metal products, computer and electronic products, food, transportation equipment, and petroleum and coal products - reported moderate-to-strong growth.
Manufacturers of fabricated metal products expressed optimism that ""we have reached the top of the hill to start down a gentle slope that lets us get back to something that resembles normal."" Their counterparts in the chemical products industry said the ""gut feeling says it's getting easier to source chemical raw materials."" 
Machinery makers reported that ""costs for steel seem to be coming down some."" They also noted improvements in ""performance by suppliers"" and ""on-time deliveries."" But transportation equipment manufacturers said capacity remained ""limited due to the global chip shortage.""
The ISM survey's measure of supplier deliveries declined to a reading of 64.9 from 72.2 in November. A reading above 50% indicates slower deliveries to factories. 
The ISM's Fiore said transportation networks, a harbinger of future supplier delivery performance, were still performing erratically, but there are signs of improvement.
Raw materials have been in short supply as global economies rebounded from the coronavirus pandemic. Shortages have also been exacerbated by the shift in demand to goods from services early in the pandemic. Millions of workers needed to produce and move raw materials remain sidelined. (Graphic: More jobs than jobseekers, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/JOBS/egvbkmeoepq/chart.png) 
U.S. stocks were trading mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index having hit fresh record highs earlier in the session. The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly lower.
PRICE GAUGE FALLS
The nascent signs of improvement in supply chains suggest inflation at the factory gate could soon begin to subside. 
The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers tumbled to 68.2 last month, the lowest level since November 2020, from 82.4 in November. The 14.2-point plunge was the biggest since October 2011.
This supports the Federal Reserve's long-held view that the current period of high inflation is transitory. Inflation is well above the U.S. central bank's flexible 2% target.
""The report is consistent with our expectation that inflation will hit an inflection point probably in the first quarter of this year,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index fell to a still-high reading of 60.4 from 61.5 in November. With customer inventories remaining depressed, the slowdown in new order growth is likely to be temporary or limited. 
Factories hired more workers, but turnover rates remained high, a trend which manufacturers said started in August.
Indeed, a separate report from the Labor Department on Tuesday showed a record 4.5 million Americans voluntarily quit their jobs in November, which will put pressure on businesses to raise wages to attract workers. 
""Replacing those workers is proving unusually challenging,"" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. ""This is the tightest labor market ever.""  
There were 10.6 million job openings at the end of November. The high number of vacancies meant there was 0.65 unemployed person per job opening, an all-time low. Before the pandemic, there were normally about 2.3 unemployed people per job opening. (Graphic: Quitting en masse, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/znpnelbrxvl/chart.png) 

The ISM's measure of manufacturing employment rose to an eight-month high of 54.2 from 53.3 in November. This, together with very low first-time applications for unemployment benefits, supports the view that job growth accelerated in December. 
According to a preliminary Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 400,000 jobs in December after rising by 210,000 in November. The Labor Department is scheduled to publish December's employment report on Friday.

""Due to renewed coronavirus restrictions, the situation will remain tense for the time being,"" said Alexander Krueger, an analyst with Hauck Aufhaeuser Lampe private bank.

The GfK market research institute said last month that consumer morale would deteriorate further as the pandemic and rise of the Omicron variant push the economy to the brink of recession.
The Ifo institute expects the German economy to shrink by 0.5% on the quarter in the final three months of 2021 and stagnate in the first three months of 2022. This would bring Germany close to a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction.
High infection rates during the fourth coronavirus wave in Germany, triggered by the Delta variant, had already resulted in restrictions for retailers and service providers in December.
Germany banned unvaccinated people from entering non-essential establishments. The so-called 2G rule, which allows access only for vaccinated or recovered people, has hit the Christmas business.

The rapid spread of the Omicron variant is now clouding the outlook for retailers at the start of 2022 as well.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz and state premiers are expected to discuss further measures and restrictions at a pandemic emergency meeting on Friday.

The Labour Office said the number of people out of work fell by 23,000 in seasonally adjusted terms to 2.405 million. A Reuters poll had forecast a fall of 15,000.
""The labor market developed well at the end of the year. The recovery of the previous months continued,"" Labour Office head Detlef Scheele said.
The seasonally-adjusted jobless rate fell to 5.2%, the lowest since March 2020, when Germany entered its first coronavirus lockdown.
Scheele cautioned that a jump in COVID-19 cases and renewed restrictions to contain the spread of the disease increased uncertainties.

This was mirrored in the fact that more companies signalled in December they could soon put more workers on furlough again. 
In October, the latest month for which reliable data was available, the number of employees put on reduced working hours in job protection schemes, also known as Kurzarbeit, fell to some 710.000. That was sharply down from its peak of around 6 million reached in April 2020.

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers increased their borrowing in November by the most since July 2020, according to Bank of England data which added to signs of an early Christmas spending spree by shoppers before the Omicron coronavirus variant hit the country.
Consumer credit rose by a net 1.233 billion pounds ($1.67 billion), stronger than the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists for a rise of 800 million pounds.
Data published last month showed British retail sales rose faster than expected in November, helped by earlier-than-usual Black Friday discounts as well as early Christmas shopping. 
Tuesday's figures from the BoE showed consumer credit rose by 0.4% in the 12 months to November having fallen in the preceding months of 2021. It was the first 12-month increase since March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic hit Britain.
Bethany Beckett, an economist with Capital Economics, said the figures seemed like old news giving the recent surge in COVID infections which had probably hit willingness to borrow.
""And, with real household disposable incomes facing a squeeze from higher inflation and higher taxes in the coming months, we suspect consumer spending may struggle to make much headway over the next few quarters,"" she added. 
The BoE figures also showed mortgage approvals in Britain in November were the lowest since June 2020 after the expiry of a tax break for home buyers. Approvals edged down to 66,964 from October's 67,103.
Mortgage lending rose by a net 3.693 billion pounds, up from October's slump to 1.149 billion pounds after the stamp duty tax break expired fully at the end of September.

However, the increase in November was almost 3 billion pounds below the average in the 12 months to June when the tax break was in full effect, the BoE said, suggesting cooling demand in the housing market.

Investing.com – China’s factory activity grew at a faster pace in December, thanks to production hikes and easing price pressures. However, a weaker job market and business confidence is weighing on the market.
Data released earlier in the day showed that the Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) was 50.9, the highest since June 2021 and above the 50-mark indicating growth. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a 50 figure, whereas the index was at 49.9 in November.
Official data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released during the previous week showed that the manufacturing PMI was at 50.3 in December, up from the previous month’s reading of 50.1.
Governmental efforts to stabilize prices and increase supply, which eased price pressures for raw materials, contributed to faster factory activity.
However, the Caixin survey also showed a fall in both new export orders and a gauge for employment, which hit the lowest level since February of 2021.
""Supply was strong and demand rebounded. With the easing of supply constraints, output expanded for the second month in a row and at a faster pace. But the job market was still under pressure and businesses were less optimistic, indicating an unstable economic recovery. The repeated COVID-19 flare-ups and sluggish overseas demand were factors of instability,” Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe told Reuters.
“Policymakers should focus on shoring up employment as well as on targeted support to small and midsize businesses,” Wang added.
Slower manufacturing growth, debt woes in the property sector, and sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks slowed down China’s economic recovery, after an initial strong start in 2020.
The People’s Bank of China has stated that it will maintain a flexible monetary policy in 2022 to stabilize growth and lower financing costs for businesses under economic headwinds.
On the COVID-19 front, various cities in China saw outbreaks. The eastern coastal province of Zhejiang saw a small-scale COVID-19 outbreak in December 2021, which has since subsided, but during which some firms were forced to suspend production. The northwestern city of Xi’an remains under a lockdown that began on Dec. 22, 2021, as an outbreak in the city continues."

China’s factory activity expanded in December as production and sales picked up, though employment remained weak, a private gauge showed Wednesday. 
The Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 50.9 last month from November’s 49.9, Caixin and IHS Markit said in a statement Tuesday. Economists had expected a marginal improvement to 50, the dividing line between expansion and contraction. 
Output rose at the fastest pace in the past year, supported by improved market conditions and stronger customer demand, while inflation eased, according to the statement. Employment fell for the fifth month in a row, with the sub-index dropping to 48.7, the weakest since February last year. 
“Manufacturing demand and supply improved in December with easing inflationary pressure,” said Wang Zhe, a senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, which released the data. “But the job market was still under pressure and businesses were less optimistic, indicating unstable economic recovery.”
Total new orders increased as virus flare-ups were largely brought under control, while external demand was lackluster, according to the statement. Factory inflation eased from the peak, with the average input costs rising at the weakest rate for 19 months in December.
The findings are in line with official data released last week that showed a slight acceleration in the purchasing managers’ index from the previous month. The Caixin index surveys mainly smaller and private companies, while the official PMI mostly covers larger, state-owned enterprises. 
China’s economy is facing rising pressure on multiple fronts, with policy makers focusing efforts on stabilizing growth with “proactive” policies. The housing market is struggling, local government finances are being hit by weak land sales and there has been a series of recent Covid-19 outbreaks, including one which caused authorities to lock down the city of Xi’an.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's annual inflation rate surged to 36.1% last month, its highest in the 19 years that Tayyip Erdogan has ruled, laying bare the depths of a currency crisis engineered by the president's unorthodox interest rate-cutting policies.
In December alone, consumer prices took a rare step into double-digits, rising 13.58%, Turkish Statistical Institute data showed on Monday, eating deeper into the earnings and savings of Turks rattled by the economic turmoil.
The year-over-year CPI outstripped a median Reuters poll forecast of 30.6% with staples such as transportation and food - which took increasing shares of households' budgets during 2021 - rising even faster.
Turkey's lira shed 44% of its value last year as the central bank slashed interest rates under a drive by Erdogan to prioritise credit and exports over currency and price stability.
On Monday the currency whipsawed down 5% then up 3%. It stood at 13.0790 versus the dollar at 1734 GMT, some 0.8% firmer than Friday's close.
Some economists predict inflation could reach as high as 50% by spring unless the direction of monetary policy is reversed. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said it would remain above 40% for most of the year ahead.
""Rates should be immediately and aggressively hiked because this is urgent,"" said Ozlem Derici Sengul, founding partner at Spinn Consulting in Istanbul.
The central bank was however unlikely to act, she added, and annual inflation ""will probably reach 40-50% by March"", by when administered price rises would have been added into the mix, including a 50% minimum wage hike. 
Turkey now has the eighth-highest inflation in the world, according to a Trading Economics listing.
Last year was the worst for the lira in nearly two decades, while the annual CPI was the highest since the 37.0% reading of September of 2002, two months before Erdogan's AK Party first took office.
Erdogan's focus early on Monday was on trade data which showed exports surged by a third to $225 billion last year.
""We have only one concern: exports, exports and exports,"" he said in a speech, adding the trade data showed a six-fold rise in exports during his tenure as leader.
Later, Erdogan said he was ""saddened"" that Turks had to face such high inflation levels, pledging to bring it down to single digits as soon as possible.
To support the currency and replenish its depleted reserves, the central bank said on Monday it had asked exporters to sell 25% of their hard-currency revenues to the bank for lira.
""WE DON'T GO OUT"" 
Erdogan overhauled the central bank's leadership last year. The bank has slashed the policy rate to 14% from 19% since September, leaving Turkey with deeply negative real yields that have spooked savers and investors.
The subsequent accelerating surge in prices and drop in the lira have also upended household and company budgets, scuttled travel plans and left many Turks scrambling to cut costs. Many queued last month for subsidised bread in Istanbul, where the municipality says the cost of living is up 50% in a year. 
""We don't sit with our friends in a cafe and drink coffee any more,"" Mehmet, 26, a university graduate, said. ""We don't go out, just from home to work and back again.""
The central bank has argued that temporary factors had been driving prices and forecast a volatile course for inflation, which - having been around 20% in recent months and mostly double-digits over the last five years - it said in October would end the year at 18.4%. 
Sengul suggested that, with Monday's data, that argument had run its course.
""This reflects a vicious cycle of demand-pull inflation, which is very dangerous because the central bank had implied the price pressure was from cost-push (supply constraints), and that it couldn't do anything about it,"" she said. 
Reflecting soaring import prices, December's producer price index rose 19.08% month-on-month and 79.89% year on year. Annual transportation prices soared 53.66% while the food and drinks basket jumped 43.8%, the CPI data showed.

The economic turmoil has also hit Erdogan's opinion polls ahead of an election scheduled for no later than mid-2023.
The lira touched a record low of 18.4 against the dollar in December before rebounding sharply two weeks ago after state-backed market interventions, and after Erdogan announced a scheme to protect lira deposits against currency volatility.

The IHS Markit Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index was flat in December at 49.4, unchanged from November, but still below the 50 threshold that separates growth from contraction.
The index has consistently remained below that threshold every month since March 2020 and plummeted to 35.0 in April 2020 amid the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, in what was by far the lowest reading in the survey's 10-1/2 year history.
""2021 was not a great year for Mexican manufacturers, and December was no different. The latest set of PMI data showed further contractions in output, new orders and exports, with respective sequences of reduction extended to 22 months,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit.
Goods producers again indicated that limited container availability, transportation problems and global shortages of raw materials caused severe delays in average lead times, while supply chain issues pushed input costs higher in December, the survey said.
The overall rate of purchasing price inflation was the third-fastest on record.
Inflation in Mexico reached 7.45% in early December after averaging 7.37% in November, which was the highest rate in Mexico since early 2001, according to National statistics agency INEGI.

De Lima said that firms also continued to see their order books shrink as demand was dampened by a combination of market uncertainty, rising prices, reduced client requirements and an inability to distribute goods in a timely manner due to lingering problems sourcing raw materials. 
""Worryingly, companies don't expect supply-side problems and price pressures to dissipate in 2022. Business sentiment towards the year-ahead outlook for production fell to an eight-month low as said concerns mounted,"" said De Lima.

For 2022, the government has a budget deficit outlook of 4.85%. By law, Indonesia's budget deficit must be under 3% of GDP in 2023.
Handy Yunianto, Mandiri Sekuritas's fixed income analyst, said this year's fiscal deficit has the potential to narrow further to 4.1% as some tax hikes approved by parliament in late 2021 are to be factored into the revenue target.
Those measures include an increase in value added tax rate, a new carbon tax in April and a tax amnesty programme that will run in the first half of 2022.
Josua Pardede, Bank Permata's economist, said that the 2022 fiscal deficit could come in at a range of 3.75%-4.25% of GDP.
However, Sri Mulyani said it would be hard to forecast 2022, arguing that she could not have predicted last year's events such as the spread of the Delta variant and the commodity boom.

The global coronavirus pandemic had left factories struggling to get the materials they need and sent costs soaring, but a tentative easing of the supply issues led to a marked decrease in price pressures.
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dipped to 58.0 in December from November's 58.4, matching an initial ""flash"" estimate and still comfortably above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday and seen as a good guide to economic health, held steady at November's 53.8.

""We're seeing some tentative, but very welcome signs that the supply chain crisis which has plagued production lines all across Europe is beginning to recede. Although what gains to be had were only marginal ... PMI data showed stocks of purchases rising at a survey-record rate in December""
That easing meant the input prices index sank to an albeit still high eight-month low of 86.7 from 88.9, allowing factories to raise their prices at a much slower pace than in November.

""Easing inflation rates are again a welcome sign, but we're still in hot territory,"" Hayes added.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's economy expanded at its fastest annual pace in over a decade in 2021 as the country emerged from its worst recession on record, caused by the deep hit to activity from the coronavirus pandemic.
The city-state's economy grew 7.2% in 2021, preliminary data showed on Monday, broadly in line with the government's official projection and rebounding from the record 5.4% contraction in 2020. 
The financial and transport hub, often seen as a bellwether of global growth, has staged a rocky recovery as governments around the world shift their coronavirus strategies to living with the pandemic, away from ""zero-COVID"" policies.
Singapore's annual gross domestic product growth was the fastest since a 14.5% expansion in 2010, when the economy emerged from the global financial crisis.
""I'm expecting growth to be relatively buoyant. As the world economy starts to improve, I think that will also help to support the overall external demand conditions for Singapore,"" said MUFG analyst Jeff Ng. ""The main threat continues to be inflation.""
The government has previously said it expects GDP to grow 3% to 5% in 2022.
GDP rose 5.9% in October-December on a year-on-year basis, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said in a statement, faster than the 5.4% growth forecast in a Reuters poll on analysts.
GDP grew 2.6% on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted basis in October-December, higher than the 1.2% growth in preceding quarter.

Separately, the Southeast Asian city-state on Monday posted a preliminary 5% rise in private home prices in the fourth quarter, the most since 2010.
The government implemented a package of measures to cool its property market last month, including raising stamp duties and tightening loan limits.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said last week in his New Year message Singapore's economy is recovering steadily and that the government sees a need to start raising sales tax.
The government has flagged a plan to raise the goods and services tax by 2 percentage points to 9% between 2022 and 2025. 
While analysts expect the economy to continue to grow, they cautioned that the Omicron coronavirus variant could become a drag if social distancing rules are tightened again.
The city-state has vaccinated 87% of its population. As of Saturday, 41% of the population has received their COVID-19 booster shot.
Sung Eun Jung at Oxford Economics expects growth to be led more by the service sector than the manufacturing in 2022 as domestic demand momentum improves.
""We expect monetary and fiscal policies will further tighten this year with planned GST hike adding to rising price pressures,"" she said.
Economists widely expect the central bank to tighten again in April this year as price pressures persist. Similar to major financial hubs around the world, Singapore has seen its inflation rate rise in the past few months with headline prices up 3.8% in November, the fastest in nine years. 

The Singapore dollar weakened slightly in thin trade on Monday, in line with modest gains for the U.S. dollar in the broader market. At S$1.3510 per dollar, it is not far from the seven-week high it touched at the close of last year and analysts said the GDP figure would likely be supportive.

696,"<span>Jan 02, 2022 11:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkish inflation is expected to surge to a 19-year high in December, propelled by a slump in the lira and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s push for cheaper borrowing. 
Data due Monday will show consumer prices rose for a seventh straight month to an annual 27.36%, compared to 21.31% in November, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 19 economists.
Turkey’s central bank has slashed its benchmark interest rate by 500 basis points since September in a series of moves encouraged by Erdogan, who has attacked higher rates as a challenge for businesses and a brake on economic growth. The cuts have sent the lira into a tailspin that’s fueled consumer price rises. 
The lira recovered some of its losses in December after Erdogan introduced a mechanism that promises to compensate holders of the lira when the currency weakens to a certain level. However, the currency remains about 31% weaker than it was on Sept. 23, when the central bank started cutting interest rates. It remains the worst performer among emerging market currencies against the dollar this year, with a slump of around 43%. 
How Erdogan’s Plan to Halt the Lira’s Fall Is Meant to Work 
“We expect a broad-based surge in inflation in December due to the depreciation in the lira until the introduction of the new lira deposit scheme,” said Ibrahim Aksoy, Istanbul-based chief economist at HSBC Asset Management. “While the lira has recovered with the new lira deposit facility, the possible retail price declines will probably be limited due to the high costs incurred when the lira was weaker.”
The recent rate reductions sent real yields deeper into negative territory as consumer inflation climbed in the fourth quarter. Though rising inflation has hurt Erdogan’s popularity ahead of the 2023 election, he’s insisted he will push on with a policy shift he said aims to boost manufacturing and exports and reduce the influence of international markets on Turkish monetary policy.  
The central bank expects inflation to follow a volatile course though it expects its looser monetary stance will see inflation resume its downward trend “once temporary effects disappear.” 
The bank has repeatedly said that transient factors rather than lower interest rates are behind the latest surge in prices. Turkey’s monthly inflation will begin to slow in January as the lira stabilizes and the government cracks down on unjustified price increased, Finance Minister Nureddin Nebati said on Wednesday in a televised interview.  
“A wide-ranging deterioration in price dynamics, higher trend inflation as well as an increase in the FX pass-through points to a more challenging inflation outlook in 2022” said Ehsan Khoman, head of emerging market research for Europe, Middle East and Africa at MUFG Bank in Dubai. “Our CPI estimates remain well-north of 20% until the fourth quarter of 2022.” 
The central bank raised its year-end inflation estimate to 18.4% from 14.1% in inflation report published in October. The next inflation report will be published on Jan. 27. The central bank will hold its next rate-setting meeting on Jan. 20.

The AIB IHS Markit manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 58.3 in December from 59.9 in November, having hit a record 64.1 in May, the survey showed. Readings above 50 indicate overall rises in activity.
From October to December, the PMI registered 60.1, down from 62.1 in the third quarter and 62.9 in the second but higher than in any previous quarter since the survey began.
Cost pressures remained intense with raw materials, fuel, energy and transport charges cited as driving inflation. While the input prices subindex eased to a three-month low, it was still higher than at any period prior to October's peak.
Manufacturers continued to pass higher costs on to customers, with output prices increasing at the third-fastest rate since the data series began in 2002.

""Manufacturing production is still expanding at a rapid pace, with new orders recording another marked rise, though growth in export orders remains muted,"" AIB chief economist Oliver Mangan said.
""Employment in the sector continued to grow at a solid pace. Meanwhile, manufacturers were very positive on the 12-month outlook for production, with sentiment hitting its best level since July.""

The IHS Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the final month of the year rose to 51.9 from 50.9 in November, remaining above the 50 threshold that indicates expansion in activity for a 15th consecutive month.
The survey on Monday showed output continued to shrink on supply chain constraints, with firms facing semiconductor chip shortages and weak demand, though the pace was the mildest in three months.
New orders - which have the largest weighting in the PMI - grew at a faster pace as domestic demand conditions improved, offsetting sluggish overseas sales.
""Survey data showed new export orders falling for the first time since September 2020, which firms attributed to rising COVID-19 cases globally, congestion at ports and a lack of available shipping containers,"" said Joe Hayes, senior economist at IHS Markit.
Manufacturers continued to face acute cost pressures, notably in oil, natural gas, ores and electronics prices, which led them to pass higher charges on to clients.
Firms, however, remained optimistic over the coming year that supply chain pressure would ease as global economic conditions improve and on hopes for new product developments.
That led to a pick up in hiring, following two straight months of job shedding, with the rate of growth accelerating to a six-month high.

Still, economist say supply shortages need to show significant improvement for manufacturing to make a solid turnaround.
""Given South Korea's prominence in the automotive and electronics industries, substantial improvements in global supply chains will be required before we see a meaningful acceleration in manufacturing growth,"" Hayes said.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's exports expanded at their fastest pace in 11 years in 2021, with the total export value reaching a record high, supported by post-pandemic recoveries in global demand.
For the full year, exports rose 25.8% from a year earlier to $644.54 billion, trade ministry data showed on Saturday, the fastest pace since 2010. 
That also marked the first growth in three years after contractions of 5.5% and 10.4% in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
""Now is the time to head towards the $700 billion export-era ... The trade ministry will step up policy efforts so that industries and exports can tow the complete (economic) normalisation this year,"" Minister Moon Sung-wook said.
A breakdown by items showed exports of semiconductors jumped 29% year-on-year to a record $128 billion, while those of petrochemicals also surged 54.8% to a record $55.1 billion. Other items such as cars and steel jumped 24.2% and 37%, respectively.
By destination, exports to China, South Korea's biggest trading partner, rose 22.9%, and those to the United States and the European Union jumped 29.4% and 33.9%.
Meanwhile, imports for the full year jumped 31.5% to a record $615.1 billion, rebounding from a 7.1% contraction in 2020.
Moon also said the ministry is reviewing joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and aims for more trade pacts to expand its export markets.
Saturday's data also showed exports in the final month of the year expanded 18.3% year-on-year, extending growth into a 14th straight month, though the rate was slower than 32% in November. A Reuters' poll of 13 economists had expected 22% growth.

Total exports stood at $60.74 billion in December, the largest ever monthly figure.
A 35.1% jump in semiconductors exports led December growth, while overall exports to China and the United States also soared 20.8% and 22.9%, respectively.

(Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden and Senator Joe Manchin spoke about the ""Build Back Better"" bill a day after the conservative Democratic senator publicly rejected the president's social spending plans, a White House adviser said on Friday.
""He (Biden) has some confidence about that (bill), including discussions he has had with Senator Manchin,"" Jared Bernstein, a member of the White House council of economic advisers, said in an interview with CNN on Friday.
""The president and Senator Manchin - the day after that announcement where the senator said he couldn't vote for the bill as it was - they were talking again.""
Reuters previously reported that Biden and Manchin made no significant progress in the talks after Manchin's rejection of the plan earlier in December but aides felt reassured that lines of communication were still open and cordial. Biden told reporters this week that the pair have not spoken since then.
Manchin's rejection imperils the legislation because his support is crucial in the Senate where the Democrats have the slimmest margin of control and Republicans are united in their opposition to the bill. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said the chamber would vote on a package in early 2022.
Manchin's move prompted investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to lower its forecasts for U.S. economic growth. Manchin's rejection of the bill threatened to scuttle hundreds of billions of dollars in funding for measures to fight climate change and meet the Biden administration's climate goals.
Manchin has expressed concerns about a number of proposals in Biden's signature domestic policy bill, including multiple climate proposals and extending monthly child tax credit payments.

Biden told reporters after Manchin's rejection that he and the senator were ""going to get something done"" on the legislation.
U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal, a leading liberal House Democrat, has asked Biden to continue focusing on the social spending legislation and urged him to use executive action despite Manchin's public rejection of the plan.

The COVID-19 pandemic dampened wine trade globally in 2020, the latest year for which data are available, as restaurants and bars remained closed for long periods.
Champagne was hit the hardest. Sales outside the EU of the famed French sparkling wine fell over 20% by volume to 66 million litres in 2020 from nearly 84 million litres the previous year.
That largely contributed to a 6% overall drop in EU exports of sparkling wines last year compared to 2019, the Eurostat data showed.
EU exports fell from a peak of 528 million litres in 2019 to 494 million litres in 2020 - still nearly twice the level recorded in 2010.
Of the three main categories of sparkling wine exported from the EU, only champagne recorded a significant drop by volume.
Prosecco, which is by far the most exported, recorded sales outside the EU of 205 million litres in 2020, compared to nearly 207 million litres in 2019.
Cava, which is produced in Spain, bucked the trend by increasing its extra-EU exports by more than 10% to 58 million litres in 2020, getting closer to replacing champagne as the second most sold EU sparkling wine outside the 27-nation bloc. 

Total champagne sales, including in the EU, fell 18% last year by volume, producers' group CIVC has estimated.
Despite the drop in sales by volume, vintage champagnes have proven a lucrative draw for investors this year, outperforming all major financial market assets from Big Tech to bitcoin. Salon le Mesnil's 2002 vintage surged more than 80% in value in 2021 on online platforms.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 50.3 from 50.1 in November, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed. 
Analysts had expected it to fall slightly to the 50-point mark, which separates growth from contraction. 
The world's second-largest economy has lost steam since the early summer after rebounding from last year's pandemic slump, weighed down by a slowing manufacturing sector, debt problems in the property market, carbon emissions-related curbs, and small-scale COVID-19 outbreaks. 
Next year, China will face ""unprecedented"" difficulty in stabilising trade, Vice Commerce Minister Ren Hongbin warned on Thursday, as production capacity in other exporting countries recovers from COVID-induced shocks and competes with Chinese exports. 
""Looking to January, we expect the manufacturing PMI to fall to 50.0, weighed on by the stricter-than-usual anti-pollution measures to ensure blue skies for the upcoming Winter Olympics that will start in early February and contracting demand as result of the property downturn and slowing export growth,"" Nomura economists wrote in a note. 
Data from the statistics bureau showed a sub-index for new orders improved slightly in December but remained in contraction, at 49.7 versus 49.4 in November. 
New export orders shrank further, with the sub-index coming in at 48.1 compared with 48.5 a month earlier, indicating fragile overseas demand.
A sub-index for production remained in positive territory at 51.4, but was lower than November's 52.0.
""Compared with previous cycles, we believe the pain threshold is higher, as Beijing has given more weight to long-term targets than to short-term growth stability,"" Nomura said.
""Still, there is a limit to how much they will allow growth to slow, and this limit could be seriously tested in the spring of 2022.""
COVID DISRUPTIONS
The wealthy Zhejiang province on China's eastern coast saw a small-scale COVID-19 outbreak in December, which has now subsided, but some firms were forced to suspend production. 
In the northwest, the industrial and tech hub of Xian has been under lockdown as a local outbreak continues to spread in the city of 13 million.
Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), two of the world's largest memory-chip makers, have warned that the ongoing lockdown of the city could affect their chip manufacturing bases in the area.
Activity in China's overall services sector grew at a slightly faster pace in December, rising to 52.7 from November's 52.3. 
China's official composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, stood at 52.2 in December, unchanged from November. 
Analysts expect a further slowdown in fourth-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) after the economy grew 4.9% in July-September.
Debt crises at major real estate developers amid a crackdown on the property sector have hurt an industry critical to China's economic growth.
The central bank in mid-December cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) - the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve - to bolster slowing economic growth.
The bank has said it will keep monetary policy flexible next year as it seeks to stabilise growth and lower financing costs for businesses amid the growing economic headwinds. 

Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance Securities, said he expected more support measures to be rolled out. 
""In our view, 2022 should bring more targeted easing to engineer a soft landing and support SMEs, high-tech and innovation firms, advanced manufacturing and green industries,"" Pang said.

The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to 50.3, beating the median estimate of 50, the National Bureau of Statistics said Friday. The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, increased to 52.7, above the consensus forecast. The 50-mark separates expansion from contraction in conditions. 
China’s economy is facing rising pressure on multiple fronts, with policy makers announcing a shift in focus to stabilizing growth next year with “proactive” policies. However, the housing market is still struggling, local government finances are being hit by weak land sales and there has been a series of recent Covid-19 outbreaks, including one which caused authorities to lockdown the city of Xi’an. 
Friday’s data showed China’s economy maintained its recovery trend, Zhao Qinghe, senior statistician at the NBS, said in a statement. The manufacturing PMI climbed for a second straight month as some commodities prices fell significantly and cost pressures of companies eased to some extent, he said. 
However, insufficient demand remains a main problem for manufacturers. More than 39% of the surveyed companies said they face such issues, indicating “the problem of shrinking demand is still prominent,” Zhang Liqun, a researcher with the State Council’s Development Research Center, said in a statement released by the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing.
New orders remained subdued and new export orders worsened, highlighting the pressure China faces to stabilize trade next year. Construction activity cooled, with the sub-index falling to 56.3 due to cold weather and the approach of holidays, Zhao said. 
The property downturn continues to dampen sentiment and slow down construction activities, and government pressure on local governments to borrow and spend isn’t yet having much effect in boosting investment and construction. 
A set of earliest available indicators tracked by Bloomberg suggested that while the economy remained stable overall, the slumping property sector and slowing external demand are clouding the outlook.

Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released earlier in the day showed that the manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) increased to 50.3 in December, up from the previous month’s reading of 50.1. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a 50 figure.
Meanwhile, the non-manufacturing PMI rose to 52.7 from November’s 52.3.
Economic recovery in the world’s second-largest economy has lost steam since early summer 2021, after an initial strong recovery in 2020. Slower manufacturing growth, a debt-ridden property sector and resurgence of COVID-19 outbreaks all contributed to this slowdown.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. health experts on Thursday urged Americans to prepare for severe disruptions in coming weeks as the rising wave of COVID-19 cases led by the Omicron variant threatened hospitals, schools and other sectors impacting their daily lives.
The warning came as the United States reached a record high in COVID-19 cases, while federal officials issued more travel warnings and reportedly prepared to authorize booster shots for 12 to 15-year-olds next week.
For the second day in a row, the United States had a record number of new reported cases based on the seven-day average, with more than 290,000 new infections reported each day, a Reuters tally showed. 
At least 18 states and Puerto Rico have set pandemic records for new cases, according to the tally. Maryland, Ohio and Washington, D.C., also saw record hospitalizations as overall U.S. COVID-19 hospitalizations rose 27%.
The surge comes amid increased holiday travel, with New Year's celebrations still to come, and as schools grapple with students' return to classrooms following winter breaks. 
""We are going to see the number of cases in this country rise so dramatically, we are going to have a hard time keeping everyday life operating,"" Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota, told MSNBC.
""The next month is going to be a viral blizzard,"" he said. ""All of society is going to be pressured by this."" 
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease official, on Wednesday said cases will likely rise throughout January, a warning echoed by the governor of Louisiana, where hospitalizations have more than tripled in the past two weeks.
""We are still at the very beginning of this current surge,"" John Bel Edwards told a news conference on Thursday. ""January is going to be very, very challenging."" 
U.S. health officials have said early data show Omicron appears less severe but have continued to push vaccinations, masks and physical distancing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also issued new guidelines shortening isolation and quarantine periods, which have been criticized by some disease experts https://www.reuters.com/world/us/no-tests-no-problem-experts-question-new-us-cdc-policy-covid-isolation-period-2021-12-29 and health care workers.
U.S. health regulators plan to approve a third vaccine dose for 12 to 15-year-olds next week, according to media reports. Boosters are already approved for those 16 and older.
With testing shortages and breakthrough cases, experts warn the surge would stress hospitals and businesses, although some state and city leaders said on Thursday they would keep schools open for children returning from winter break next week.
""We are committed in Arkansas to in-class instruction,"" Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson said. ""It’s so important to our future, to our students, to their mental health.""
Rising hospitalizations as healthcare workers are sidelined with their own COVID-19 infections is also concerning, as are fewer effective therapeutics, Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious disease expert at Baylor College of Medicine, told CNN.
A rise in in hospitalization of children across the United States has also fueled concerns. 
Already, 825,663 people have died in the United States from COVID-19 since early 2020, data showed, with the latest wave of hospitalizations driven by those not vaccinated.
President Joe Biden this month announced new plans to combat Omicron, but some experts have criticized the measures as arriving too late.
'HUNKER DOWN'
Cruise operators took a hit on Thursday after the CDC warned people to avoid cruises regardless of their vaccination status due to onboard outbreaks, a potential drag on an economy that otherwise appears to be holding up. 
While airline travel has been widely disrupted, holiday sales were strong, new claims for state unemployment benefits fell last week to their lowest level of the pandemic, and U.S. stocks hit record highs on Thursday.
How schools handle the surge is also key, especially for working parents. U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona told MSNBC that schools should stay open and that federal funds were available for staffing and testing to help make that happen.
""We can't shut down our city again,"" New York City Mayor-elect Eric Adams said while unveiling his plan on Thursday to fight COVID-19 while keeping the country's most populous city -- including its schools -- open for business.
Conditions should improve after January, as testing shortages ease and recently-approved medicines become more widely available, experts said. 
""We do have light at the end of the tunnel,"" said University of Minnesota's Osterholm. ""But for right now, you're going to have to hunker down.""
In Arkansas, which on Thursday reported a record high of 4,978 new cases, Hutchinson said the state would make 1.5 million at-home tests available to residents, a move he hoped would free up health care workers to staff hospitals.

West Virginia Governor Jim Justice urged the relatively high proportion of unvaccinated people in his state to get inoculated but said he was against mandates.
If the situation worsens ""and a bunch more people die, you'll have a run on the bank as far as people running to get vaccinated or to get their booster shots,"" Justice said.

Industrial production rose 5.1% in November from the previous month, the statistics office said Thursday, ending three months of declines and beating economists’ estimate for a 2.5% increase. Automobile production gained 11.3% as a supply shortage of chips eased, while semiconductor manufacturing increased 4.5%.
Korea’s output rebound, along with improvements seen in Japan, adds further evidence that global manufacturing was on the mend before the new variant disrupted economic re-openings in some countries. Outside the pandemic, the monthly production gain was the biggest seasonally adjusted gain since 2009.

Korea’s preliminary trade figures last week suggest global demand has held up despite a worsening of the pandemic, but there’s much uncertainty as to whether the momentum will be carried over into 2022. 
While countries are refraining from re-imposing harsh lockdowns, heightened caution against the variant may still weigh on business activity.  
Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said in a Thursday Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post that the November gains in output fully recovered the losses in the past three months and contributed to the fastest increase in facilities investment since 2014.

(Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit in goods mushroomed to the widest ever in November as imports of consumer goods shot to a record ahead of the second straight COVID-distorted holiday shopping season along with industrial supplies, while exports slipped after a historic gain a month earlier.
The goods trade gap reported Wednesday by the Commerce Department is likely to remain historically high as long as the coronavirus pandemic continues, economists said. The emergence of the fast-spreading Omicron variant of COVID-19 that has driven U.S. and global caseloads to a record this week may exacerbate it further in the near term if it limits American consumers' spending on services and restokes demand for imported goods.
Omicron also stands as a downside risk in the housing market. A reading of pending home sales also out Wednesday showed an unexpected drop in November, and while that data largely predated Omicron's ascendance in the United States, the highly contagious new variant could further limit home sales in the near term, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) said.
The goods trade deficit widened last month by 17.5% to $97.8 billion from $83.2 billion in October, Census Bureau data showed. That exceeds the previous record deficit set in September of $97 billion and may damp optimism that trade might finally add to U.S. economic growth this quarter for the first time in more than a year.
Imports rose by 4.7% with industrial supplies leading the way with an increase of $5.7 billion to $63.2 billion, followed by consumer goods rising by $2.9 billion to just shy of $67 billion as retailers rushed to fill store shelves ahead of Christmas. Both were record highs.
""The emergence of the Omicron variant may further ignite demand for imported goods if services activity is restricted"" in the first quarter of 2022, Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics, wrote after Wednesday's report.
Goods exports, meanwhile, declined 2.1%, with weakness across the board outside of a 4.3% increase in food exports. The drop was led by declines of $1.4 billion in industrial supplies in and $1.3 billion in capital goods.
The worldwide surge of coronoavirus cases to a record in recent days - including a record U.S. caseload - may weigh on global demand in the months ahead, risking an even wider trade gap, Vanden Houten said. (Graphic: U.S. goods trade deficit hits a record, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/znvneldmbpl/chart.png) 
The so-called Advance Indicators report also showed wholesale inventories climbed 1.2% last month, while retail inventories increased 2.0%. Retail inventories, excluding autos, which go into the calculation of gross domestic product, edged up by 1.3% to $465.2 billion, the latest in a string of record-high readings.
The economy grew at a 2.3% annualized rate in the third quarter, a step-down from earlier in the year but activity has rebounded in the fourth quarter with a consensus among economists building around a growth rate of 6% to 7% in the final three months of 2021.
Trade has been a drag on gross domestic product growth for five straight quarters, while inventories added to output in the third quarter. 
Earlier this month, the Commerce Department reported a sharp reduction in the overall trade deficit - including services - for October, which had generated some optimism that trade may contribute to the improvement in output in the final quarter of the year. The big reversal to a record goods trade gap in November may prompt a rethinking of that.
Economists at Action Economics have dialed back their fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate to 6.5% from 7.0%, with exports now seen subtracting from growth rather than adding to it as had been previously expected. Economists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), meanwhile, left their estimates intact at 7%.
Meanwhile, contracts to buy U.S. previously owned homes fell unexpectedly in November as limited housing stock and lofty prices crimped activity, and the explosion of new coronavirus cases poses a risk to the housing market headed into 2022. 
NAR said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on signed contracts, fell 2.2% last month to 122.4. Pending home sales were lower in all four regions.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast contracts, which typically become final sales after a month or two, would rise 0.5% in November.

""There was less pending home sales action this time around, which I would ascribe to low housing supply, but also to buyers being hesitant about home prices,"" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist.
Looking ahead, Yun said Omicron poses a risk to the housing market's performance, as buyers and sellers are sidelined, and home construction is delayed.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast contracts, which typically become final sales after a month or two, would rise 0.5% in November.
Pending home sales dropped 2.7% in November on a year-on-year basis. Limited inventory has led to double-digit growth in home prices.
""There was less pending home sales action this time around, which I would ascribe to low housing supply, but also to buyers being hesitant about home prices,"" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. ""While I expect neither a price reduction, nor another year of record-pace price gains, the market will see more inventory in 2022 and that will help some consumers with affordability.""
Demand for housing shot up early in the coronavirus pandemic as Americans decamped from city centers to suburbs and other, less densely populated areas in a hunt for larger homes to accommodate online schooling and working from home.
The market cooled off in the first half of the year as limited inventory lifted prices beyond the reach of many would-be buyers. Also the rollout of vaccines fueled optimism that people would be able to return to work in offices in urban areas and other business districts.
Activity has picked up again in recent months, however. The combined annual sales rate of new and existing U.S. homes reached 7.2 million units in November, the highest since January.

Now, though, new variants of COVID-19 - first Delta and now Omicron - have swept across the country, forcing employers to retreat again on large-scale return-to-office plans. The U.S. coronavirus caseload has shot to a record in the last week, according to a Reuters tally, surpassing the previous peak set early this year.
NAR's Yun said Omicron, the highly transmissible variant seen driving the latest surge in infections, poses a risk to the housing market's performance, as buyers and sellers are sidelined, and home construction is delayed.

In absolute terms, remittances to the region were expected to rise by $21.2 billion this year and $19.8 billion next year, the Manila-based lender said in a report published on Tuesday. 
Inflows to the region last year reached $314 billion, the ADB said.
On average, the Asia Pacific region was estimated to account for about 63.4% of the total increase in global remittances in 2021 and 2022, the ADB said.
It said worldwide remittance receipts could increase by 4.8%, or $34 billion, in 2021 and by 4.2%, or $30.7 billion, in 2022.

About 60% of the remittance inflows to the Asia-Pacific region would likely come from the United Kingdom, United States and the European Union, while nearly 30% would be from the Middle East, it said.

October's seasonally adjusted contraction was the third month-on-month decline in economic activity in a row, figures from national statistics agency INEGI showed.
A Reuters poll of analysts had forecast the economy would grow by 0.8% during October following a disappointing third quarter in which gross domestic product (GDP) shrank by 0.4%.
""Going forward, lingering supply-chain frictions, cost-push pressures, policy uncertainty, and weak business confidence are likely to weigh on the broad industrial sector for a while,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos said in a client note.
Still, Ramos said Mexico's economy had room to grow and should benefit in coming quarters from terms of trade, increasing COVID-19 vaccinations, and normalization of activity in sectors still lagging, particularly services.
Separate INEGI data showed exports performed strongly in November, reaching a record $43.9 billion in seasonally adjusted terms, and contributing to an adjusted trade surplus of $463 million after six straight months of deficits.
Mexican business operations have been disrupted by bottlenecks in international supply chains, which have led to temporary work stoppages in industries including carmaking, a pillar of the country's manufacturing sector.
But a breakdown of the INEGI figures showed the contraction in October was led by weakness in tertiary activities, which cover services, and by primary activities, which encompass farming, fishing and mining.

Primary activities shrank by 1.2% from September, while tertiary activities were down by 0.5%. By contrast, secondary activities, which include manufacturing, rose by 0.6%.
Compared to the same month last year, the economy grew in October by 0.3% in seasonally adjusted terms. In unadjusted terms it shrank 0.7%, the INEGI data showed.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's November consumer inflation marked the biggest year-on-year rise in nearly two years on surging fuel costs, a sign that the fallout from global commodity price gains is broadening.
The increase, however, is unlikely to prompt the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to withdraw monetary stimulus any time soon, with inflation still distant from the central bank's 2% target, analysts say.
The data released on Friday highlights the fresh challenge policymakers face in preventing rising costs of living from hurting already weak household spending and Japan's fragile economic recovery.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Thursday a weak yen could be inflicting bigger pain on households than before by pushing up prices of imported goods.
""Faced with price hikes for a range of daily necessities, consumers may become even more cautious in boosting spending,"" said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities.
Japan's core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food but includes oil costs, rose 0.5% in November from a year earlier, government data showed, exceeding a median market forecast for a 0.4% gain.
It was the biggest increase since February 2020 and followed a 0.1% rise in October.
The gain was driven by a 15.6% surge in energy costs. Food costs also rose 1.4%, indicating households were facing higher grocery costs even when wage growth remains slow.
Core consumer inflation is already above 1% when stripping away the impact of this year's cuts in cellphone charges, which knock off 1.5% point off the index, analysts say.
""We expect underlying inflation to accelerate to a peak of around +1.0% next year as goods inflation rises further and the drag from mobile phone tariff cuts drops out of the annual comparison,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.

Japan has not been immune to global commodity inflation, with wholesale prices rising a record 9.0% in November from a year earlier.
But core consumer inflation has hovered around zero, as firms remain cautious about passing on costs to consumers on concerns that households may hold back on spending.
 
"
720,"<span>Dec 23, 2021 06:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Japanese consumer prices rose at a faster pace in November as higher energy costs offset the impact of sharp cuts in mobile phone fees.  
Consumer prices, excluding those for fresh food, gained 0.5% compared with a year earlier, the ministry of internal affairs reported. Economists had forecast a 0.4% increase.
Rises in global commodity prices and higher import costs on a weaker yen have pushed Japan’s inflation back above zero. But the impact on the consumer price index has been muted in Japan compared with other nations mainly because of government-initiated cuts to mobile phone fees. 
Japanese companies are facing the biggest cost pressure in four decades, and some companies are opting to pass higher costs to consumers while many remain reluctant to do so out of fear of losing customers to competitors. 
 What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“Japan’s core inflation looks set to come in at a yawn-inducing 0.4% in November. Strip out mobile phone charges, though, and it might get your blood racing -- we estimate that narrower measure could approach 2%.”

More details:
Unlike in the U.S. and Europe, the inflationary pressure has yet to cause monetary policy changes in Japan with the central bank pledging to keep up its stimulus until the 2% inflation target is achieved. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said last week a weaker yen has been a plus for the economy as a whole by boosting exports and the value of earnings abroad. 
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is looking to make companies raise pay for workers by larger amounts through bigger tax incentives. The BOJ has long argued that higher wages are a key to increasing consumer spending and securing a sustained gain in inflation. His economic stimulus measures approved last month include help for people and businesses to deal with higher energy prices.

JOHANNESBURG/LONDON (Reuters) -Omicron advanced across the world on Thursday, with health experts warning the battle against the COVID-19 variant was far from over despite two drugmakers saying their vaccines protected against it and signs it carries a lower risk of hospitalisation.
Coronavirus infections have soared wherever the highly infectious Omicron variant has spread, triggering new restrictions in many countries and record new cases.
But in another glimmer of hope two days before Christmas, a U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) official said data indicated that both Merck & Co Inc's and  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 anti-virals are effective against the variant.
There were encouraging signs too about hospitalisation rates from Britain and South Africa, although the head of a leading African health agency joined the World Health Organization in cautioning that it was too soon to draw broader conclusions.
""Let's be careful not to extrapolate what we are seeing in South Africa across the continent, or across the world,"" Africa Centres for Disease Control (CDC) chief John Nkengasong said.
Nevertheless, U.S. stock indexes and yields on U.S. Treasuries both climbed on Thursday, partly on new optimism after Omicron helped ratchet up market volatility for much of the last month of 2021.
""Today is a very calm day. It’s the relief over Omicron apparently not being as bad as we feared,"" Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA), said.
Even as Omicron has begun leaving an imprint on parts of the U.S. economy, economists say it so far seems unlikely to prevent a second straight year of above-trend growth. 
First identified last month in southern Africa and Hong Kong, Omicron is becoming dominant in much of Europe including Britain https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/englands-covid-19-prevalence-reaches-record-1-45-people-ons-2021-12-23, where daily new infections have soared beyond 100,000. 
France had its worst-ever day in terms of new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, with more than 91,000 recorded, while Germany reported its first Omicron death.
In Italy, the first Western country to be hit by the pandemic last year, all public New Year's Eve celebrations were banned, while Greece banned public Christmas festivities. Both countries also made outdoor mask-wearing mandatory. 
In the United States, millions of Americans pushed ahead with holidays including cross-country flights. Authorities said 2,081,297 passengers were screened through the nation's airports on Wednesday, 144,000 more than on the same date in 2019 before the pandemic. 
Increases in hospitalisations and deaths in South Africa and Britain since Omicron took hold appear to have been only gradual, and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/astrazeneca-shot-third-dose-works-against-omicron-study-2021-12-23 and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/novavax-says-covid-vaccine-boosts-response-omicron-variant-2021-12-22 joined other manufacturers in saying their shots protect against it.
University of Edinburgh https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/scotland-reports-fewer-covid-19-hospitalizations-with-omicron-2021-12-22 researchers who tracked 22,205 Omicron patients said on Wednesday the number who needed to be hospitalised was 68% lower than they would have expected, based on the rate in patients with Delta.
Imperial College London https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/hospital-stay-risk-omicron-is-40-45-lower-than-delta-uk-study-2021-12-22 researchers reported evidence of a comparable 40%-45% reduction in hospitalisation risk.
Britain recorded a record number of new coronavirus cases on Thursday, with the daily tally reaching 119,789. But analysis of preliminary data by the UK Health Security Agency showed an individual with Omicron was estimated to be between 31% and 45% less likely to attend hospital compared to someone with Delta, and 50% to 70% less likely to be admitted.
UKHSA boss Jenny Harries said this was ""an encouraging early signal"", but added: ""this is early data and more research is required to confirm these findings"".
In Washington, the FDA authorised Merck's anti-viral pill for certain high-risk adult patients, a day after giving the go-ahead to a similar treatment from Pfizer. 
Both pills worked, said Patrizia Cavazzoni, a top FDA official, adding that both interfere with how the virus replicates, a process that is not altered across variants. 
'DON'T OVER-INTERPRET'
Scientists have warned that, with the surge in cases in Britain, even a small proportion of hospitalisations could overwhelm the healthcare system. 
In the U.S. Midwest, Omicron's rapid spread has hospitals ""preparing for the worst,"" with their personnel already severely strained from a wave of the Delta variant.
The British data supported findings from South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD).
A separate South African government-backed study, yet to be peer-reviewed, on health workers given the Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) vaccine identified ""clear and early de-coupling"" of hospitalisation from Omicron cases compared with Delta.
AstraZeneca said a three-course dose of its vaccine offered protection against the variant, citing data from an Oxford University lab study.
Findings from the study, yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, matched those from rivals Pfizer-BioNTech, and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA).
Novavax also said early data showed its vaccine - authorised for use by the European Union and WHO but yet to be approved by the United States - generated an immune response against Omicron.
But the older Delta variant lurks.
The coronavirus death toll in Russia, where officials had detected only 41 Omicron cases, passed 600,000 on Thursday, Reuters calculations based on official data showed, after a surge of Delta-linked infections.
Only the United States and Brazil have recorded more coronavirus deaths.

(Reuters) - The fast-spreading Omicron variant of COVID-19 has started leaving an imprint on slices of the U.S. economy as some events are canceled or postponed, consumers cut back on restaurant dining and understaffed businesses shut down in some of the most-afflicted areas such as New York City. 
But even as economists say the variant could be a drag on growth early next year, they caution it is too soon to gauge the mark that will be left by an iteration of the virus that may on balance prove less severe even if it is the most transmissible version yet in nearly two years of the pandemic. It also seems unlikely at this stage to prevent a second straight year of above-trend growth.
Preliminary data out Thursday from the U.K. government showed a 50-70% lower probability of an Omicron infection resulting in hospitalization than with the Delta variant. That followed a study on Wednesday from South Africa, where Omicron was first identified last month, that suggested infections peaked quickly there and symptoms were less severe. 
Nonetheless, Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics, expects the U.S. economy to take a hit in the near term from a surge that could infect more people than earlier waves but end more quickly. He now forecasts the U.S. economy will grow by 2% in the first quarter of 2022, down from 5%.
""Omicron is already affecting people’s behavior and business practices,"" said Zandi, pointing to a decline in credit card spending over the past several weeks. 
Credit card balances were fractionally lower in the week ending Dec. 8, marking the first time since October that they didn't increase week over week, according to the Federal Reserve. 
Consumers are also cutting back on trips to restaurants as the virus spreads. The number of diners seated at U.S. restaurants was down 10% for the week ending Dec. 23 when compared with the same week in 2019, according to the restaurant reservations site OpenTable. That is lower than Nov. 25, when dining activity was on par with 2019 levels. 
""The situation is changing rapidly and this is far from the resurgence many restaurants were counting on this holiday,"" Debby Soo, chief executive of OpenTable, said in a statement to Reuters.
Still, other parts of the economy appeared to be running as usual for now. 
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits held below pre-pandemic levels last week. And while workplace activity declined slightly last week after rising earlier in December, it was in line with the drop seen heading into the holidays in 2019 and stronger when compared to the same time last year, said Dave Gilbertson, vice president of the payroll management firm UKG. 
""So far, we haven’t seen widespread business shutdowns, and customer demand remains strong across industries,"" Gilbertson said in an email. 
And Americans by and large seemed more committed to their holiday travel plans. The number of people checked through airport security in the approach to Christmas is roughly double last year's volumes, Transportation Security Administration data showed. Wednesday's total exceeded the comparable 2019 level by about 144,000 passengers, one of only a handful of days so far to top pre-pandemic levels and by the largest margin yet. 
TOO EARLY TO KNOW
Some analysts say it may just be too soon for the effects of Omicron to show up in economic reports. 
Consumer sentiment improved in December but Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers said ""too few interviews"" were done to capture the impact of the Omicron variant.
""Confidence and spending are likely to be depressed in January, but it is too early to know the eventual impact of Omicron on the economy,"" Curtin said in a statement on Thursday. 
Some economists are downgrading their forecasts for how much the U.S. economy and the labor market will grow early next year amid a surge in infections and a decline in fiscal support. 
Oxford Economics lowered its growth projections for next year to 4.1% from 4.4% because of the surge in infections, and says growth could slow to 3.7% if President Joe Biden's Build Back Better spending plan is completely blocked. The package's odds of passing dimmed after Senator Joe Manchin said he would not support the bill, but some analysts say a modified version of the bill could be approved later.
And Aneta Markowska and Thomas Simons, economists for Jefferies, earlier this week said economic activity is likely to soften in January, and they ""see relatively high probability"" the labor market could contract next month, similar to December 2020, if more businesses furlough workers because of the virus. 

Biden announced new steps this week meant to stem the health and economic consequences of the infection surge, including new sites for testing and vaccination, more at-home rapid tests and an extension of the pause on student loan payments until May 1, 2022. 
Zandi says that despite the slowdown he is expecting, growth could rebound quickly in the second quarter and the economy could expand by just over 4% next year. That would be almost double the annual growth rate that prevailed in the decade before the pandemic.

Car production fell by 28.7% compared with November 2021 to 75,756 units, despite a 53% increase in electric vehicle output, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.
It was the fifth consecutive month of decline and represented the worst November performance since 1984. 
Some of the fall was due to the permanent closure of a Honda's car factory in July but SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said the figures were ""incredibly worrying"" and underscored the severity of the industry's situation.
It the first 11 months of 2021, British car production of just under 800,000 units was down by 433,000 compared with 2019, before the pandemic hit.
""COVID is impacting supply chains massively, causing global shortages - especially of semiconductors - which is likely to affect the sector throughout next year,"" Hawes said.
The risks of a new economic slowdown caused by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus and rising inflation represented the toughest business environment in decades, Hawes said.
""We have to look to government to provide support measures in the same way it is recognising other COVID-impacted sectors,"" he said.
Britain announced on Tuesday 1 billion pounds of extra support for hospitality and leisure businesses which have been hit hardest by Omicron.

Hawes said Britain's automotive industry was as well prepared as it could be for the implementation of full post-Brexit customs controls at UK borders from Jan. 1 but any delays would put further stress on just-in-time operations. 
""Should any problems arise, contingency measures must be implemented immediately to keep cross border trade flowing smoothly,"" he said.

There is a record backlog of houses authorized for construction but not yet started, according to government data published last week. Builders are struggling with worker shortages, expensive materials and delays getting supplies.

The figures point to strong housing demand in the final quarter of the year despite still-high prices. However, rising Covid-19 cases in the U.S. and overseas could create supply chain and labor headwinds in the coming months, slowing construction and leading to further inventory shortages. 
The new home sales report, produced by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, showed the median sales price of a new home rose 18.8% from a year ago to a record $416,900.
There were 402,000 new homes for sale as of the end of November, up from a month earlier. At the current sales pace, it would take 6.5 months to exhaust the supply of new homes, compared with four months a year ago.
Growing Backlogs
Of the homes sold in last month, construction on 221,000 had yet to be started, the most since May, suggesting backlogs are growing. Already completed homes 164,000, the lowest since August.
Sales rose in all regions but the Midwest. The West posted the largest gain, with the strongest pace since January.
Separate data Wednesday showed that existing home sales, which make up 90% of home purchases, increased for a third straight month in November.
New-home purchases account for about 10% of the market and are calculated when contracts are signed. The new-homes data are volatile; the report showed 90% confidence that the change in sales ranged from a 4.8% decline to a 29.6% increase.

Retail sales of new vehicles could fall 17.7% to 2,923,600 units from a year earlier, the report said.
""Intense demand with this limited supply is resulting in prices continuing to increase,"" said Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Powers. 
Auto manufacturers of all sizes are grappling with the strongest inflationary pressure in three decades, following a relentless rise in raw materials prices.
Average transaction prices are expected to reach $45,743, going above the $45,000 mark for the first time, and 20% higher than December 2020 when prices first breached the $38,000 level.
Production at auto plants rose 2.2% last month after advancing 10.1% in October. But November motor vehicle output remained 5.4% below the levels seen in the same period last year because of a global shortage of semiconductors.
Total new-vehicle sales for December 2021, including retail and non-retail transactions, are projected to reach 1,245,600 units, a 20.5% decrease from last year.
""A mild improvement in the chip shortage may be overshadowed by risk from the surge in Omicron variant COVID-19 cases"", said Jeff Schuster, president, Americas operations and global vehicle forecasts, LMC Automotive. 
The average new-vehicle retail transaction price in December is expected to reach $45,743, the previous high was in November at $44,515. 

The seasonally adjusted annualized rate for total new-vehicle sales is expected to be 13 million units, down 3.5 million units from 2020.
Despite the added risk, the consultants expect 2022 global light vehicle sales to improve to 86 million units, an increase of 750,000 units from last month.

Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dipped 0.1% last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. These so-called core capital goods orders shot up 0.9% in October.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0.6%. 
Shipments of core capital goods gained 0.3% last month after increasing 0.4% in October. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the GDP measurement.
Business spending on equipment contracted in the third quarter after four straight quarters of double-digit growth. It was weighed down by a shortage of motor vehicles. A global shortage of semiconductors is hampering motor vehicle production.

Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, accelerated 2.5% last month after edging up 0.1% in October. They were boosted by a 6.5% jump in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 0.3% drop in October. Motor vehicle orders increased 1.0% after rebounding 5.8% in October.

Purchases of goods and services, after adjusting for higher prices, were little changed following a 0.7% gain in October, Commerce Department figures showed Thursday. Unadjusted for inflation, so-called nominal spending rose 0.6%, matching the median estimate of economists.
Underlying the spending figures are a series of crosscurrents. Buffeted by headlines about snarled supply chains, many Americans started their holiday shopping earlier than usual this year, helping to explain the strong advance in the prior month.
But consumers are also facing the fastest inflation in decades. With every trip to the grocery store and gas pump eating away a little more of their paychecks, people have less left over for discretionary purchases. And the new omicron variant of Covid-19 threatens to curb the incipient rebound in outlays for services.
The personal consumption expenditures price gauge, which the Federal Reserve uses for its 2% inflation target, increased 0.6% from a month earlier and 5.7% from November 2020, the highest reading since 1982. Those figures were in line with economists’ estimates, and followed an annual increase in the Labor Department’s consumer price index that was also the fastest since 1982.
The data come on the heels of a hawkish pivot by Fed officials, who have been under pressure to take action against overheating prices. Last week the central bank announced it would accelerate the end of its asset-buying program, and new interest-rate projections indicated policy makers favor raising borrowing costs by three-quarters of a percentage point next year.
Consumers are saving less amid the rapid price increases. Adjusted for inflation, disposable personal income, or after-tax income, fell 0.2%, the fourth straight decline. The savings rate -- personal saving as a share of disposable income -- declined to 6.9%, the lowest since December 2017. Nominal personal income rose 0.4% last month. 
Though federal stimulus has waned, a host of companies have hiked pay this year to attract and retain talent amid widespread hiring struggles. In November, wages and salaries rose 0.5%, following a 0.8% gain in October, the report showed.

Still, the performance marked an 11th month of gains, bringing the number of formal jobs created so far this year to 2.993 million, the highest for the period in a historical series that began in 2010.
The increase was led by the services sector, which created 180,960 formal jobs in November. Four of five sectors covered by the Labor Ministry showed net job growth in the month, with the exception of farming, which lost 16,797 jobs.

The resource-rich country has been enjoying an export boom on the back of rising prices of its top commodities such as coal, palm oil, tin, steel and rubber.
Exports in the first 11 months of the year reached $209.2 billion, up almost 43% on a yearly basis, with November's shipments of $22.84 billion a record monthly figure.
""If the numbers are consistent in December, we will see exports surpassing $225 billion to $230 billion and 2021 will be the highest in our export history,"" Minister Muhammad Lutfi told a news conference.
Indonesia's previous record high for exports was $203.5 billion in 2011, at the peak of the previous commodities' upcycle.
""Our surplus has reached $34 billion ... If consistent, we will book a $35 billion surplus in 2021,"" Lutfi added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence improved further in December, suggesting the economy would continue to expand in 2022 despite a resurgence in COVID-19 infections and reduced fiscal stimulus.
The survey from the Conference Board on Wednesday showed more consumers planned to buy a house and big-ticket items such as motor vehicles and major household appliances as well as go on vacation over the next six months. Inflation concerns eased a bit and households remained upbeat about the labor market.
This will likely help to underpin consumer spending even as government income to households is diminishing. 
President Joe Biden's signature $1.75 trillion domestic investment bill known as Build Back Better (BBB), which aims to expand the social safety net and tackle climate change, suffered a blow on Sunday when moderate Democrat Senator Joe Manchin said he would not support it. That prompted economists to slash their growth estimates for next year.
""Consumers are bullish on 2022,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""This is further evidence that consumer spending will keep rising and be the main factor fueling the expansion.""
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index increased to a reading of 115.8 this month from an upwardly revised 111.9 in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 110.8 from the previously reported reading of 109.5. The cut-off date for the survey, which places more emphasis on the labor market, was Dec. 16.
Consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions was little changed, but their short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions was upbeat, which the Conference Board viewed as ""setting the stage for continued growth in early 2022."" 
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months fell to 6.9% from a more than 13-year high of 7.3%. Its so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, slipped to a still-high reading of 42.6 this month from 44.7.
This measure correlates to the unemployment rate from the Labor Department. The share of consumers planning to buy a motor vehicle over the next six months increased. Buying intentions for household appliances like washing machines, dryers and refrigerators also rose and more consumers were inclined to buy a house and go on vacation over the next six months.
The show of underlying strength as the nation confronts a winter wave of coronavirus infections, driven by the Delta and highly contagious Omicron variants is welcome news. Surging infections could significantly curb growth in the first quarter.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
STRONG HOUSING DEMAND
The run of good news was extended by a second report from the National Association of Realtors showing existing home sales rose 1.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.46 million units in November.
But the housing market continues to be dogged by a severe shortage of homes for sale, which is keeping house prices elevated and squeezing first-time buyers out.
The median existing house price increased 13.9% from a year earlier to $353,900 in November. First-time buyers accounted for 26% of sales last month, compared to 32% a year ago. That was the smallest share since January 2014.
The reports added to October consumer spending data as well as a sharp narrowing of the trade deficit and steady rebuilding of inventories by businesses in suggesting the economy this year is on track to record its best performance since 1984. 
A third report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed gross domestic product increased at a 2.3% annualized rate in the July-September quarter, revised up from the 2.1% rate estimated last month.
Growth last quarter was the slowest since the second quarter of 2020, when the economy suffered a historic contraction in the wake of stringent mandatory measures to contain the first wave of coronavirus cases.
The economy was restrained by a resurgence in coronavirus infections over summer, shortages of motor vehicles amid strained global supply chains as well as a decline in pandemic relief money from the government to businesses, households and state and local governments. 
Growth was also hampered by Hurricane Ida, which devastated U.S. offshore energy production at the end of August.
""The recovery will end 2021 on a strong note, with strong household finances, rising employment, and an improved health backdrop, before Omicron arrived, supporting GDP growth above 7% in fourth quarter,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

Fourteen out of 22 industries contributed to GDP growth in the third quarter. Services industry output increased at a 3.9% rate, led by professional, scientific and technical services, finance and insurance, administrative and waste management, as well as accommodation and food services, and information. That partly offset decreases in retail and wholesale trade.
Output in the goods-producing industries contracted at a 5.5% pace, reflecting a broad decline that was dominated by construction. The government sector grew at a 5.1% rate, led by state and local governments.

The Conference Board’s index increased to 115.8 from an upwardly revised 111.9 reading in November, according to the group’s report Wednesday. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had called for a reading of 111. 
The data suggest consumers remain optimistic despite new Covid-related restrictions in some parts of the country as the omicron variant spreads. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and various economists have said that each coronavirus wave brings a smaller economic impact as Americans become more comfortable adapting to the virus and its variants.
Households in December became slightly more sanguine about their inflation expectations for the coming year, which hit a 13-year high last month, according to the Conference Board’s data. 
The Conference Board’s expectations index increased to a five-month high of 96.9, while the gauge of current conditions edged down to 144.1.
The share of consumers who said jobs were “plentiful” fell slightly to 55.1%. Consumers said they were more likely to purchase cars, homes and appliances.

QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso said on Tuesday the government will from January gradually reduce a tax levied on international transfers, which he said negatively affects efforts to attract foreign investors.
Lasso, a conservative ex-banker who took office in May, has taken various measures to appeal to investors as he seeks to revive an economy battered by coronavirus. 
The capital exit tax, charged on transfers made from the Ecuador to other countries, has been harshly criticized by exporters who say it raises their costs.
The 5% tax will be reduced by one percentage point next year, Lasso said in a television interview. 
""We are going to reduce the capital exit tax by one point in 2022, through 0.25% (reductions) each quarter and beginning on Jan. 1,"" Lasso said.
""It's a tax on the entrance of capital that has done a lot of harm to Ecuador,"" Lasso said. ""For fiscal reasons we can't eliminate it in one go. We need to do it gradually so we don't impact public finances.""
The tax raised $1 billion in 2020, according to government figures.
Lasso added he is also working to reduce the country's fiscal deficit, which is set to end this year at around $4 billion and next at $2.6 billion. 
""We'll gradually lower taxes as the economic situation of the country allows,"" he said.

Lasso in November ordered the implementation of a controversial tax reform, after lawmakers failed to block or approve the bill. 
The reform will raise an additional $1.9 billion in tax revenue during its first two years, partly by increasing tax contributions from larger companies and reducing the amount of deductions those who earn more than $2,000 per month can claim.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. current account deficit surged to a 15-year high in the third quarter amid a record increase in imports as businesses rushed to replenish depleted inventories to meet strong demand.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, accelerated 8.3% to $214.8 billion last quarter. That was the largest shortfall since the third quarter of 2006. 
Data for the second quarter was revised to show a $198.3 billion deficit, instead of $190.3 billion as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a $205.0 billion deficit last quarter.
The current account gap represented 3.7% of gross domestic product. That was the largest share since the fourth quarter of 2008 and was up from 3.5% in the April-June quarter. 
Still, the deficit remains below a peak of 6.3% of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 as the United States is now a net exporter of crude oil and fuel. 
The wider deficit is not a problem for the United States given the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency. The third quarter likely marked a peak for the current account gap, though much would depend on the severity of the COVID-19 Omicron variant. The trade deficit narrowed sharply in October. 
""Robust export growth in the fourth quarter suggests the balance has likely reached a cyclical trough and the latest trade data signals a narrower deficit in the fourth quarter,"" said Mahir Rasheed, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Assuming a moderate impact from the Omicron variant in the first quarter, we look for stronger foreign consumption and moderating U.S. demand to drive the current account deficit lower next year.""
Imports of goods increased $10.0 billion to a record $716.4 billion, boosted by petroleum products and chemicals. Services imports rose $12.6 billion to $141.0 billion, mostly reflecting personal travel as well as sea freight and air passenger transport.
Exports of goods advanced $4.8 billion to $441.6 billion, also a record high, driven by natural gas and petroleum products. There were also increases in exports of medicinal, dental, and pharmaceutical products. But exports of corn and soybeans fell.
Services exports fell $0.1 billion to $190.8 billion, pulled down by decreases in charges for licenses for the use of patents and trade secrets. There were also declines in exports of telecommunications, computer and information services. But professional and management consulting services increased. 

Primary income receipts increased $17.9 billion to $281.9 billion, lifted by direct investment income as well as portfolio investment income amid a surge in equity prices. Payments of primary income rose $8.6 billion to $233.7 billion, reflecting higher interest rates on long-dated debt securities.
Secondary income receipts climbed $0.1 billion to $41.6 billion, reflecting taxes on income and wealth.

Inflation in the euro zone's fifth-largest economy is likely to run at 3.0% in 2022 and 2.9% in 2023, after a spike in energy prices drove up consumer prices by an estimated 2.7% on average this year, the DNB said.

""But for now, we don't see undesirable levels of wage inflation"", the central bank added, as wages are expected to rise by 2.5% on average in the next two years.
The European Central Bank (ECB) last week said inflation in the euro zone as a whole would fall slightly below 2% by the end of 2022 and was expected at 1.8% in 2023 and 2024.
The Dutch economy has rebounded more strongly than most other euro countries from its coronavirus slump, and the DNB said it expects it to expand by 4.5% this year and 3.6% in 2022 before growth moderates to 1.7% in 2023.
This strong recovery is also visible in the labour market, where the number of vacancies has been higher than the number of unemployed for months and the DNB expects unemployment to remain at historically low levels until at least the end of 2023. 

The outlook could worsen, however, if the coronavirus pandemic continues to limit activity throughout next year, the bank said.
The Netherlands reverted to a strict lockdown on Sunday, closing all but essential stores and most other public places in a bid to limit the spread of the Omicron variant.

KONYA, Turkey (Reuters) - Turkish labourer Hasan Sarikaya says he has no job, no money and no hope for a better future while President Tayyip Erdogan - the leader he supported for years - remains in power.
Like many people in the industrial city of Konya in Turkey's conservative heartlands, which enjoyed an economic boom in the early years of the Erdogan era, Sarikaya has been hit by the crash in the lira, spiralling inflation, and a business slump.
Their misfortunes may spell trouble for Erdogan as economic pain erodes support for Turkey's most successful modern politician and transforms the next elections, due in mid-2023, into the toughest test of his two decades in power.
""I'm looking for work, I can't pay my debts... there is no solution. People are fed up now,"" said Sarikaya, 31, speaking on a busy Konya street. ""I voted (for Erdogan) for years... Watch now, he won't be able to save himself.""
Erdogan's enduring appeal through more than a dozen national and local election triumphs was based on a record of economic growth and pious conservative values which enthused millions of Muslim Turks who had long felt ignored by a secular elite.
Konya, home of the revered 13th-century Sufi mystic poet Rumi, has been a bastion for his AK Party (AKP), turning under his rule from an agricultural centre into an industrial powerhouse.
Erdogan won 75% of Konya's vote in the 2018 presidential election and AKP support was higher than in all but one of Turkey's 81 provinces. That dominance is now threatened by an unprecedented set of challenges.
Other Konya residents who spoke to Reuters, including industrial workers, farmers and students, echoed Sarikaya's lament over rising prices and fewer jobs. 
Although many said they would stick with Erdogan's party at the next elections, national surveys over the last year suggest Sarikaya's disillusion is part of a wider trend, with opposition parties pulling ahead of the AKP and its parliamentary ally, the nationalist MHP.
""Never have we seen such low support for the AKP in the past,"" said Sinan Ulgen, director at the Istanbul-based Centre for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies. ""There is an increased perception that in 2023 there will be political change.""

Erdogan has ruled Turkey, first as prime minister and later as president, since 2003. Three years ago he assumed wider powers under a new executive presidency that critics say created a hyper-centralised system ill-equipped to tackle Turkey's economic, political and security challenges.
Power drained from institutions and ministries to the sprawling presidential palace in Ankara. Erdogan has dismissed three central bank governors since 2019, and sacked three bank policy makers in October.
Erdogan says the central bank remains independent, but it bowed to his call to slash interest rates well below inflation, triggering a 56% fall in the lira this year and driving up the cost of living for ordinary Turks.
The presidency did not respond to a request for comment on the impact of government policy on the economy and on support for Erdogan. 
His opponents, energised by a groundswell of support, are on the offensive, accusing him of driving Turkey into poverty. 
Erdogan's problems are compounded by the very presidential system he championed, which requires an absolute majority of votes at the ballot box, denying candidates the option of building alliances to reach the threshold. 
Polls suggest three potential rivals - the mayors of Istanbul and Ankara, both from the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), and the leader of the nationalist IYI Party - would all beat him in a straight race.
""It's a 'winner takes all' system - that raises the risk at a time when his political popularity is sinking,"" Ulgen said.
""A SULTAN IN AUTUMN""
For the first time in an election Erdogan will also face two breakaway parties established by founding members of his AKP.
One is the Gelecek (Future) Party, led by ex-prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu, the other is run by Erdogan's former ally Ali Babacan. Both offer disenchanted AKP voters a chance to reject Erdogan without abandoning his conservative values.
""If voters have to make a choice and are right-oriented, they will find another right-wing party closer to them,"" said Hasan Ekici, local Gelecek Party chairman in Konya.
While national support for the new parties remains in low single digits, even marginal swings to them could harm Erdogan enough to turn the tables.
""Developments since 2018 when Turkey had its first economic crisis under Erdogan... all point to the fact that Erdogan is a sultan in the autumn of his career,"" said Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
Concern over the 67-year-old leader's health, rebuffed by the presidential palace, has also swirled. Known as a fiery orator, Erdogan has sometimes appeared tired and pale in the past year, walking awkwardly and dozing off on camera.
In a country where half the population is 31 or younger, many have known no other leader. Erdogan says young Turks should appreciate their country's progress under him, but he has struggled to win over most young people. 
Nevertheless, Erdogan's party still enjoys more support than any other and can rely on near blanket support from media owned predominantly by his supporters.
His rule witnessed a construction boom and improved health services, and religious Turks welcomed his ending of restrictions on wearing headscarves. 
The loose alliance of his opponents lacks an agreed policy platform and has yet to select a presidential candidate.
But the gathering uncertainty over Erdogan's prospects is rippling out to the wider world, where he has been making tentative efforts to repair strained relations with some of Turkey's allies and rivals.

Unal Cevikoz, a retired ambassador, said countries such as Egypt and Israel, long at odds with Erdogan, were in no rush to make up with him. 
""People sense that the wind of change is now blowing and everybody is waiting for a change in the government,"" he said.

Taiwan's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, rose 13.4% from a year earlier to $65.5 billion last month, the highest monthly figure on record, data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs showed on Monday.
That was the 21st month of expansion, with the pace much faster than the median forecast for a rise of 5.8% in a Reuters poll.
The ministry said supply chain problems were easing and there was solid consumer demand for technologies such as notebook computers and 5G ahead of the festive season.
The ministry said it expected export orders for all of 2021 to rise between 24.9% and 25.2% versus 2020.
However, the ministry's statistics director Huang Yu-ling said there were ""too many uncertain factors next year"", including the COVID-19 pandemic and the fact 2022's numbers will be coming off the high base of 2021.
""There will be supply chain bottlenecks in the future, it is difficult to judge whether there will be high growth next year,"" Huang said.
The end of the year is traditionally busy for Taiwanese suppliers due to the Christmas and New Year holidays, followed by the Lunar New Year in February.
Taiwanese companies such as Foxconn and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) are major suppliers to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and other global tech firms.
In October, export orders rose 14.6% from a year earlier to $59.1 billion, underperforming expectations due to supply problems in the tech sector.
The ministry said it expects export orders in December to be in a range of a fall of 0.1% and a rise of 2.4% from a year earlier.

Orders from the United States rose 10.8% in November from a year earlier, a far faster rate of expansion compared with the 0.5% logged in October, while orders from China jumped 25.3%, versus a gain of 21.7% the previous month.
Orders from Europe fell 2%, while those from Japan edged up 0.7%.

The comments, at a special meeting to mark the U.N.'s international migrants day, underlined the new Islamist Taliban government's push to engage with the world community, four months after they seized power in Kabul.
The movement's deputy Foreign Minister, Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, said it was the responsibility of countries like the United States, which have blocked billions of dollars of central bank reserves, to help Afghanistan recover after decades of war.
""The impact of the frozen funds is on the common people and not Taliban authorities,"" he told the conference, attended by representatives of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and UNHCR, the United Nations refugee organization.
U.N. bodies estimate that millions of Afghans could face hunger over the winter without urgent help, but aid has been hampered by international unwillingness to engage directly with the Taliban, in part because of concern over rights for women and political inclusion.
The abrupt withdrawal of foreign aid following the Taliban victory has pushed Afghanistan's fragile economy close to collapse. Millions are without work and the banking system is only partially functional.
""If the political and economic situation doesn't change, there will be more migration,"" Stanikzai said.
The United States has issued guidance that would permit personal cash remittances to Afghanistan but it has not relented on its refusal to release the $9 billion in central bank reserves or lift sanctions on a number of Taliban leaders.

Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi met representatives from the International Committee of the Red Cross on Saturday in Islamabad, ahead of a meeting of foreign ministers from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation to discuss the situation in Afghanistan.
He said the Taliban welcomed international humanitarian organisations and gave assurances that they would be allowed to work unimpeded.

Natural gas prices have hit record highs in recent months, with energy demand outpacing supply as global economies recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing energy costs across Europe.
Greece has taken a series of relief measures, including subsidising electricity bills for four months since September and ramping up a grant for low-income households to help them buy heating oil over the winter.

LIMA (Reuters) -Peru's central bank said on Friday that it maintains its expectations that the country's economy will grow 3.4% in 2022, while it revised its guidance for 2021, saying the economy will grow by 13.2% rather than a previous estimate of 11.9%. 
Central bank president Julio Velarde added in a press conference that he expects Peru's fiscal deficit to fall to 3.1% of gross domestic product in 2021 and 2.8% in 2022. 
Peru's tax revenue has increased significantly in 2021 over pre-pandemic levels because of the high price of minerals, which has helped narrow the fiscal deficit. Peru is the world's No. 2 copper producer. 
But the mining sector is also undergoing turmoil, with one of Peru's largest copper mines, MMG Ltd's Las Bambas, set to suspend production on Saturday because of a road blockade from a local community over jobs and economic contributions. 
Las Bambas, Velarde said, represents 1.2% of Peru's GDP. 

""We are considering the Las Bambas suspension in this year's estimates, but we are also assuming that this issue will in some way be resolved next year and for Las Bambas to continue producing,"" he said.

The volume of business closures dropped sharply last year, when many businesses were kept on life support by government COVID support programmes. Court capacity was reduced and creditors faced restrictions on taking legal action until recently, slowing the process of company dissolutions.

Eurostat said inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose to 4.9%, a year-on-year surge in line with an earlier Eurostat estimate. Month-on-month, the increase was revised down to 0.4% from a previously reported 0.5%.
The ECB wants to keep inflation at 2.0% over the medium term and has repeatedly said the inflation surge is temporary. The bank expects price growth to slow during 2022, but admitted this will take longer than initially expected.
Breaking down the year-on-year total, more expensive energy added 2.57 percentage points to inflation, services 1.16 points, non-energy industrial goods 0.64 points and food, alcohol and tobacco a further 0.49 points, Eurostat said.
Without the volatile energy and unprocessed food prices, a measure the ECB calls core inflation, prices rose 0.1% on the month for a 2.6% year-on-year gain. 
An even narrower measure, looked at by many economists, that also excludes alcohol and tobacco showed prices unchanged in the month and also up 2.6% from a year earlier.

The country’s main gauge of business expectations slipped to 92.6 in December, falling for a sixth month, according to the Ifo institute. That’s a bigger decline than predicted by economists in a Bloomberg survey. Current conditions were also assessed as weaker than in November.
The data follow a string of reports highlighting the challenges for Europe’s largest economy as it navigates a fourth pandemic wave that’s come with record numbers of cases. Service providers are suffering from reinstated curbs, while manufacturers are only starting to see an easing of supply bottlenecks.
The Bundesbank acknowledged the problems in updated projections published earlier on Friday though argued that the recovery is only “slightly delayed.” 
The economy is seen suffering a setback in the current quarter and the first three months of 2022, before it’ll regain “significant momentum” in the spring amid “substantially” rising private spending. The central bank expects supply bottlenecks to be resolved by the end of next year. 
At the same time, the Bundesbank predicts inflation will remain above 2% through 2024 -- an outlook that will amplify calls within Europe’s largest economy for a speedy removal of monetary stimulus. Outgoing President Jens Weidmann is warning that price pressures could be even stronger and warned that the European Central Bank mustn’t ignore those risks.
German consumers, businesses and politicians are increasingly on edge after inflation hit 6% last month. With no replacement named yet for Weidmann, who departs at the end of the year, the team around newly appointed Finance Minister Christian Lindner has tried to assuage concerns, arguing that price stability ranks at the top of their agenda.
Citing a stronger outlook for economic growth and inflation, ECB officials on Thursday announced a gradual reduction in bond purchases next year. An emergency pandemic program will be halted as planned in March, with regular asset purchases temporarily boosted to smooth the transition.

LONDON (Reuters) -British retail sales rose faster than expected last month, helped by Black Friday discounts, early Christmas shopping and no lockdown restrictions that closed many shops last year, official figures showed on Friday.
Retail sales volumes rose by 1.4% in November on a seasonally-adjusted basis and were 4.7% higher than a year earlier, when non-essential stores were closed to the public, the Office for National Statistics said.
Economists polled by Reuters had on average forecast that sales volumes would rise by 0.8% on the month and be 4.2% higher than in November 2020. October sales were revised higher too.
""Retail sales picked up in November, boosted by strong Black Friday and pre-Christmas trading. Clothing stores fared particularly well and have exceeded their pre-pandemic level for the first time,"" ONS statistician Heather Bovill said.
Clothing and footwear sales were hard hit by the pandemic, as people went out less and shops were shut, but have now risen 51% from a year ago.
British retail sales rebounded rapidly after a slump at the start of the pandemic in 2020, but had drifted lower since a peak in April as easing COVID-19 restrictions gave consumers a wider range of spending options.
Friday's figures pre-date the spread of the Omicron variant in Britain, which are a concern for many stores, and prompted the Bank of England to downgrade its short-term growth forecasts on Thursday.
DISCOUNTS EXPECTED
""Rising cases will likely cool off the high street and put pressure on last minute online orders, and we should expect to see heavy discounting over Boxing Day and the New Year as retailers look to shift excess stock,"" said Erin Brookes, head of European retail at consultants Alvarez & Marsal.
Consumer electricals retailer Currys said its market had softened in recent weeks, online fashion retailer Boohoo warned on annual profit, and data has indicated fewer shoppers on Britain's high streets.
Previous data from the British Retail Consortium showed a 5% rise in retail spending last month as shoppers snapped up Black Friday discounts - many of which were offered earlier in the month than in previous years.
Trade bodies also had reports of people shopping earlier than usual for Christmas due to COVID concerns.
The pandemic led to a big shift towards online shopping, which has only partly reversed and accounted for 26% of spending last month compared with 20% before the pandemic.
Friday's data also highlight the inflation pressures which prompted the BoE to raise interest rates on Thursday for the first time since the start of the pandemic, and which are likely to squeeze consumers' disposable income further in 2022.

The retail sales deflator, an inflation measure used in the retail sales data, rose to 6.0% in November, its highest since August 2008.

The online car shopping guide estimated that 15.2 million new cars will be sold in 2022, representing a 1.2% increase from its 2021 vehicle sales estimate.
Shortages of semiconductor chips that control everything from heated seats to infotainment systems have caused major automakers such as General Motors (NYSE:GM) to cut production or, in some cases, build vehicles without certain features. 
""Sales have been depressed since the spring, but consumer appetite for new vehicles continues to run high, which will only serve to build up deferred demand next year and beyond,"" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' executive director of insights.

Data firm IHS Markit said on Thursday that its flash manufacturing PMI fell to a reading of 57.8 in mid-December from 58.3 in November. That was the lowest since December 2020. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 12% of the economy. Economists had forecast the flash PMI climbing to 58.5. 
Manufacturing remains underpinned by strong demand for goods and extremely lean inventories at businesses. But strained supply chains because of the COVID-19 pandemic are a constrain.
There are glimmers of hope, however. The survey showed ""supply chain delays moderating markedly during the month,"" and ""the rate of job creation quickened to the fastest since June."" It also noted that ""the rate of cost inflation softened to the slowest for seven months."" 
But shortages remained binding for the vast services sector. The survey's flash services sector PMI dipped to a reading of 57.5 from 58.0 in November.

With both manufacturing and services sectors activity slowing, overall business activity cooled this month. The survey's flash Composite PMI Output Index fell to a reading of 56.9 from 57.2 in November.

The trade data came days after the Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan survey showed an improvement in service-sector sentiment, suggesting robust consumption will support the recovery, although the new Omicron variant and rising costs remain downside risks.
Exports climbed 20.5% in November from a year earlier, government data showed on Thursday, the ninth straight month of increase, slightly missing forecasts for a 21.2% gain but well up on a 9.4% rise in the previous month.
Shipments of cars - Japan's No.1 export item - rose 4.1% from a year earlier, marking the first increase in three months, although auto exports to the United States and China decreased year-on-year.
""The jump in exports in November suggests that most supply chain constraints in the automobile sector had already eased last month,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""Exports will remain strong over the coming months as motor vehicle exports recover further and external demand for capital goods continues to rise.""
Other than cars, growing shipments of steel, semiconductor equipment and chips contributed the most to the increase, a government official said.
    Shipments to China, Japan's biggest trade partner, increased 16.0% year-on-year, the data showed.
Imports rose 43.8% year-on-year in November to 8.32 trillion yen ($72.87 billion), the largest yen amount since comparable data became available in January 1979 and jacked up by a 144.1% rise in fuels such as oil, LNG and coal.
Imports growth accelerated from 26.7% in October and was bigger than economists' forecast of 40.0%.
That brought a trade deficit of 954.8 billion yen, the biggest shortfall since January 2020 and exceeding the median estimate for a 675.0 billion yen deficit.
""While the weak yen has certain benefits such as boosting exporters' competitiveness and inbound tourists' spending, more Japanese manufacturers have shifted production bases offshore and COVID-19 border controls shut out tourists now,"" said Masato Koike, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Rising costs are weighing on Japan when a weak yen has less impact on increasing sales of goods and services.""
The BOJ's latest tankan survey on Monday showed rising raw material costs clouding the corporate and economic outlook. BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Wednesday inflation may approach its elusive 2% target.
However, the central bank is unlikely to change its easy monetary policy at its next rate review on Friday.

    The world's third-largest economy is expected to post strong growth in October-December after a contraction in the third quarter, as household spending improved on low COVID-19 infections.

LONDON (Reuters) -Euro zone business growth slowed more than expected this month as renewed restrictions imposed to curb the Omicron coronavirus variant curtailed the recovery in the bloc's dominant services industry, a survey showed on Thursday.
Europe is facing a fourth wave of infections and many governments have been encouraging citizens to stay home and avoid unnecessary social contact.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, a good indicator of overall economic health, dropped to 53.4 in December from 55.4 in November, its lowest since March and below the 54.0 predicted in a Reuters poll.
That headline number was dragged down by the services PMI, which sank to an eight-month low of 53.3 from 55.9. While above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction it missed the Reuters poll estimate for 54.1.
""The renewed decline in the Composite PMI in December suggests growth slowed to a crawl as tighter restrictions and growing consumer caution are taking their toll on economic activity, with the service sector bearing the brunt,"" said Michael Tran at Capital Economics.
Growth in demand for services dropped to its lowest since April - when it contracted - with the new business index falling to 52.6 from 54.2.
In the German private sector growth evaporated as restrictions hit the services sector in Europe's largest economy, earlier data showed.
Meanwhile, in France - the euro zone's second biggest economy and the only other country in the bloc to report flash data - activity expanded at a slower pace, a trend partly due to the new COVID-19 variant.
In Britain, outside the currency bloc, the new variant hammered hospitality and travel companies, sending private sector growth to a 10-month low, its PMI showed ahead of a Bank of England https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/inflation-risk-omicron-slowdown-boe-rate-move-balance-2021-12-16 policy announcement due later on Thursday.
The Bank's decision is a close call. Investors had been largely betting against an increase in Bank Rate with the new coronavirus wave in full swing until data on Wednesday showed British consumer price inflation https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-inflation-jumps-10-year-high-51-2021-12-15 leapt by far more than expected and hit a decade-high in November.
PRICE PRESSURES EASE
Factories, generally less affected by coronavirus restrictions, also suffered somewhat and the manufacturing PMI dipped to a 10-month low of 58.0 from November's 58.4. An index measuring output that feeds into the composite PMI nudged up to 53.9 from 53.8.
In one brighter spot for policymakers at the European Central Bank https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/ecb-set-dial-back-stimulus-one-more-notch-2021-12-15, who meet later on Thursday, price pressures abated although remained high. The input prices index eased to 87.0 from 88.9, and the output prices index staged an even bigger fall.
""Price pressures have been easing in December, albeit only cautiously. It is a cautious sign of some easing pressures coming from supply shortages, which confirms some anecdotal evidence but it's way too early to conclude that the worst is behind us,"" said Bert Colijn at ING. 
The ECB is set to halve the amount of assets it buys each month from April, according to a Reuters poll https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-economy-poll/ecb-to-halve-bond-purchases-from-april-say-economists-idUSKBN2IS00V of economists, although interest rate increases are likely years away.

But as the vaccine roll-out continues apace, optimism about the year ahead improved. The composite future output index recovered to 66.5 from 66.1.
""Forward-looking indicators also offered a glimmer of hope. Year-ahead sentiment improved marginally in December, in part due to hopes of further easing in supply-side disruptions following some encouraging signs in December,"" said Ricardo Amaro at Oxford Economics.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said the unadjusted trade surplus of the 19 countries using the euro was only 3.6 billion euros in October, down from 29.8 billion a year earlier and half of the 7.6 billion expected by economists.
While seasonally unadjusted exports rose 7.3% year-on-year in October, the value of imports rocketed 24.1%, Eurostat said. Adjusted for seasonal swings, the trade surplus was 2.4 billion euros with exports up 2.4% month-on-month and imports up 4.3%.
This was mainly a result of much more expensive energy that the euro zone imports mainly from Russia and Norway. In the first 10 months of the year the overall energy trade deficit of the whole European Union rose to 207.2 billion euros from 131.6 billion in the same period of 2020.

The EU's trade deficit with its biggest trading partner China also widened to 189.2 billion euros in January-October from 151.8 billion in the same period of 2020. 
At the same time the bloc's trade surplus with Britain continued to grow after the United Kingdom left the EU's single market at the start of 2021, rising to 115.4 billion euros in the 10 months of 2021 from 88.2 billion in 10 months of 2020.

The preliminary ""flash"" IHS Markit/CIPS UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) sank to 53.2 in December from 57.6 in November.
While still above the 50 dividing line between growth and contraction, a Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a much stronger reading of 56.4.
The survey showed slower growth in new orders and price pressures - something that will have been noted by the BoE's rate-setters who had access to the PMI in advance of their December policy decision, due to be announced at 1200 GMT.
Inflation has soared globally this year due to higher energy prices and COVID-related supply-chain bottlenecks. In Britain, post-Brexit trade and migration barriers have added to the problems.
The BoE has said interest rates will almost certainly need to rise to bring down inflation pressures, but it held off on a widely expected move last month due to uncertainty about the impact of the end of the government's job furlough programme.
Data subsequently showed no hit to the labour market, but Thursday's PMI suggested faltering economic growth caused by the Omicron variant and restrictions to slow its spread is now the main downside risk.
""Activity fell sharply in the hotels, restaurants, travel and transport sectors, and ground to a halt in other consumer-facing businesses,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The pace of economic growth looks likely to continue to weaken as we head into 2022.""
The PMI for the services sector fell sharply to 53.2 in December from 58.5 in November, reaching its lowest level since February and below all forecasts in the Reuters poll that had pointed to a reading of 57.0.
The survey's gauge of optimism hit a 14-month low.
""Concerns about prolonged pandemic restrictions and the subsequent hit to business and consumer confidence had a negative influence on growth expectations for 2022,"" IHS Markit said.
Manufacturers have fared better this month.
The factory PMI's output index rose to 53.3 in December from 52.7 in November, a four-month high, thanks to an easing in supply chain problems that have persisted for more than a year.

Export orders have fallen again, however.
""Brexit-related trade difficulties featured prominently in the comments from survey respondents that saw a drop in export sales during December,"" IHS Markit said.

IHS Markit's flash composite purchasing managers' index fell to 50.0, an 18-month low, from 52.2 in November. This was weaker than a Reuters poll of analysts who had predicted a decline to 51.1 in December.
A reading of 50 marks an unchanged level of activity, with any value above that signalling growth and any below pointing to a contraction.
""The German economic recovery was stopped in its tracks in December by the resurgence of the pandemic, as renewed restrictions and increased uncertainty dampened activity across the country's service sector,"" Markit economist Phil Smith said.
The flash PMI for services activity dropped to 48.4, a 10-month low, from 52.7 the previous month, suggesting a drop in sales among retailers in the crucial holiday season at the end of the year.
The industrial sector showed some signs of improvement after supply bottlenecks for microchips and other intermediate goods hit factory output, especially among Germany's big carmakers.
The flash PMI for manufacturing edged up to 57.9 from 57.4 in November.
""Any disruption to supply chains from the emergence of the Omicron variant seems to have been limited so far,"" Smith said.
But he cautioned that the Omicron impact may not have filtered through yet and the situation could change quickly if more infections started to appear, especially in countries with a ""zero COVID"" approach.
The PMI survey data pointed to rates of inflation in input costs and output charges easing slightly from the multi-year highs seen in November when the EU-harmonized consumer price index hit 6% in Germany.
At the same time, business expectations brightened, buoyed by hopes that supply-chain problems and pandemic-related curbs on activity could fade over the coming year, Markit said.

The Ifo economic institute said on Tuesday it expected the German economy to shrink by 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the final three months of this year and to stagnate in the first three months of next year.
Coupled with the current surge in overall prices, Germany is now facing several winter months of ""stagflation"", or zero growth combined with unusually high inflation.

Data compiler IHS Markit said that its flash composite PMI index for December, which includes both the services and manufacturing sectors, stood at 55.6 points.
While readings above 50 points point to positive overall business expectations, the latest print marked a slight drop from the 56.1 recorded in November, although it still beat the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts of 55.0 points.
""A new wave of COVID-19 infections and the emergence of the Omicron variant reportedly weighed on the upturn"", said IHS economist Joe Hayes.
The reading for growth in France's dominant services sector edged down to 57.1 points from 57.4 in November, but it beat a forecast for 56.0 points.
The flash PMI for the manufacturing sector in December fell 54.9 points, down from 55.9 points in November and falling short of the 55.5 points seen by analysts.
IHS said that overseas demand fell at the fastest pace since January.

""The drop in new foreign client business was particularly pronounced at service providers as the emergence of the Omicron variant dented tourism"", Hayes said, adding that the manufacturing sector was still experiencing shortages of raw materials and components.
""Late deliveries of inputs and delayed production schedules were commonly cited factors by survey respondents,"" he added.

The Federal Statistics Office said the negotiated wages of unionised employees rose by an average of 1.3% on the year in 2021, the smallest increase recorded since the office began compiling the data in 2010.
With consumer prices projected to rise by 3% this year, workers suffered an actual drop in real wages.
Central bankers and policymakers are watching wage developments in the euro zone very closely. They are looking for any hints as to whether rising consumer prices lead to higher wages which could mark the start of a wage price spiral and lead to higher inflation also in the medium term.
The decline in real wages bodes ill for future household spending which was the sole driver of gross domestic product growth in the third quarter in light of supply bottlenecks and production problems in the industrial sector.

Restrictions to break a fourth wave of coronavirus infections are likely to hurt retail sales and business in the services sector, knocking away Germany's last pillar of growth in the final quarter this year.
The new chancellor, Olaf Scholz from the centre-left Social Democrats, has vowed to raise the national minimum wage by around 25% to 12 euros an hour next year.

The figure was not as bad as expected by economists polled by Reuters, who had forecast production-based growth would shrink 4.5% for the quarter, while the Reserve Bank of New Zealand had pencilled in a drop of 7.0%.
The fall follows a 2.4% rise in the June quarter.
Annual GDP fell 0.3%, also better than a Reuters poll forecast for a 1.6% drop, Statistics New Zealand said in a statement.
The New Zealand dollar was largely unmoved by the announcement, maintaining earlier gains that took it to $0.6780.
New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, was in lockdown for most of the third quarter after it became the epicentre of a Delta outbreak, forcing businesses and other activities to stay shut for about 100 days. 
Retail, manufacturing, construction, and recreational activities were the most affected by lockdown measures, the statistics department said.
New Zealand's economy has rebounded strongly from last year's recession, due to its success in eliminating the coronavirus for a long period. The country was virus-free for months until the Delta outbreak in Auckland in August. 
Concerns of an overheated economy prompted the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) to raise interest rates twice in recent months.

""With (COVID) restrictions gradually easing over Q3 and Q4 we think activity will rebound in Q4,"" Ben Udy, economist at Capital Economics said in a note. 
""Given that the fall in activity in Q3 was well below the RBNZ's expectations, today's data will only add fuel to market expectations of further interest rate hikes,"" he added.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian employment blew past all expectations in November as coronavirus lockdowns were lifted, driving the unemployment rate sharply lower in a major boost to the economic outlook.
The upside surprise came just as the head of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) opened the door to an early end to bond buying should the recovery outpace expectations.
Thursday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics certainly met that criteria with employment jumping a record 366,100 in November, eclipsing market forecasts of a 205,000 rebound. 
A sharp 4.5% increase in hours worked also pointed to a strong rebound in economic growth after a Delta-driven contraction in the third quarter.
The jobless rate dropped to 4.6%, from 5.2% in October, well under forecasts of 5.0%. The decline came even as a lot more people went looking for work, pushing the participation rate up to 66.1% and back near pre-pandemic peaks.
That outperformance also suggested the RBA would have to upgrade its forecasts given it had thought unemployment would not reach 4.5% until the middle of next year.
""It's fair to say that the labour market has all but recovered from the lockdowns,"" said Marcel Thieliant, a senior economist at Capital Economics.
""The remarkable recovery suggests the RBA will end its asset purchases altogether in February.""
The central bank currently buys A$4 billion ($2.87 billion)of government bonds a week as part of its quantitative easing campaign and had been looking to taper that in February before ending purchases in May.
An early end to the programme would echo the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to cease its purchases in March, though the RBA still insists an actual hike in rates is unlikely in 2022.
""We are in no hurry to increase interest rates,"" RBA Governor Philip Lowe said earlier on Thursday, arguing that inflation and wage growth in Australia was still well below U.S. levels and rising only slowly.
Financial markets have other ideas, with futures fully priced for hike to 0.25% by June and rates approaching 1.0% by the end of the year.
Data on labour demand seem to support the market with job advertisements surging 15% in October and November to reach 13-year highs, more than 40% up on pre-pandemic levels.

Firms are also increasingly complaining of a lack of suitable workers, in part because Australia's borders remained closed to migrants and backpackers.

The economy added 366,100 roles in November, compared with economists’ estimate for a 200,000 increase, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed Thursday. The unemployment rate declined to 4.6% after having risen in the previous two months and was better than the median forecast of 5%. The participation rate rose to 66.1% from a revised 64.6% in October. 
Australia’s benchmark three-year bond yields extended gains to 11 basis points while the currency swung from a decline to a small advance.
The result will be a shot in the arm for a conservative government that’s trailing in opinion polls ahead of an election due by May. It’s aiming to further buttress its economic credentials after steering the country through a once-in-a-century pandemic, with Treasurer Josh Frydenberg releasing updated budget forecasts later today that are expected to show an improving fiscal position.
The data will also be welcomed by the nation’s monetary authorities, with the Reserve Bank aiming to tighten the labor market sufficiently -- meaning unemployment around 4% -- to spur faster inflation. The RBA is running ultra-low interest rates at present and Governor Philip Lowe says he won’t be hiking until actual inflation, not forecast, is sustainably within the central bank’s 2-3% target.
The RBA forecasts underlying inflation will only reach the mid-point of the band in late 2023. Money markets are more optimistic on the economy’s prospects and are challenging Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) stance: pricing in three rate increases next year. 
Today’s jobs data, while only one month, is likely to add ballast to the market’s view that the central bank’s guidance puts it on track to fall behind the curve.

Activity in the services sector also grew at a slower pace, slipping from a more than two-year high recorded in the prior month, suggesting it will take time for the sector to fully recoup the negative impact from the coronavirus pandemic.

""Cost pressures also remained more acute at manufacturers, with average input prices rising rapidly amid reports of higher material costs and supplier shortages.""
Manufacturers reported a decline in suppliers' delivery times and stocks of purchases and a slowing expansion of new export orders.
Both manufacturers and service-sector firms became less optimistic about business conditions in the 12 months ahead, IHS Markit's Fiddes said. 
""Concerns over supply chains, rising costs and the unpredictable nature of the pandemic (including new strains) pushed overall optimism down to the lowest in four months,"" she said.

Human resources data company XpertHR said there were signs of pay pressure with median settlements the highest since June 2020 and up from the 2.0% recorded in the three months to the end of August.
Pay freezes were much rarer than last year and the top quarter of pay awards were for a rise of at least 3%.
However, the increase is far below the 5.1% increase in consumer price inflation recorded for November and a 7.1% rise in retail price inflation which trade unions often use as a basis for wage bargaining.
""The rise in the median basic pay award could be the first sign of the pay pressure that we expect to see in the months ahead,"" said Sheila Attwood, pay and benefits editor at XpertHR.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries, led by Japan and China, rose to a record high for the month of October, data from the Treasury department showed on Wednesday.
Major foreign owners of Treasuries showed holdings of $7.648 trillion in October, an all-time peak, compared with $7.549 trillion the previous month.
The record number suggested continued appetite for U.S. government debt given uncertainty about global growth and inflation and amid low bond yields around the world, analysts said.
""U.S. yields were a little higher during the month and that may have attracted some of the buyers and made Treasuries look like a better investment,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist, at TD Securities in New York.
U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields started October with a yield of 1.4650%, rising nearly 10 basis points to 1.5609% by the end of that month.
Japan remained the largest non-U.S. holder of Treasuries with holdings in October of $1.320 trillion, a record peak, from $1.299 trillion the previous month.
China's holdings also increased to $1.065 trillion, from $1.047 trillion in September. 
On a transaction basis, foreigners sold Treasuries in the month of October to the tune of $43.5 billion, the largest outflow since May.
But TD's Goldberg said this does not reflect the true picture in terms of foreign holdings of Treasuries because there is a bias toward transactions that does not account for steady holdings.
Data also showed U.S. corporate bonds had inflows for a third straight month with $11.995 billion in October, from $1.09 billion in September.
Foreign investors, meanwhile, sold $21.827 billion in U.S. equities in October, after also selling $10.951 billion the previous month.
Data also showed that U.S. residents reduced their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net sales of $29.2

Overall, net foreign acquisitions of U.S. long-term and short-term securities, including banking flows, showed a net inflow of $143 billion in October, from an outflow of $27.3 billion in September.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased less than expected in November, likely payback after surging in the prior month as Americans started their holiday shopping early to avoid empty shelves.
A rotation in spending from goods back to services also appears to have held back retail sales last month, with the report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showing a sharp drop in receipts at electronics and appliance stores. Online retail sales were unchanged. Higher food and gasoline prices are probably curtailing discretionary spending. 
The modest retail sales gain did not change views that the economy was regaining steam after a slowdown in the third quarter that was triggered by the COVID-19 Delta variant and rampant shortages. In a nod to soaring inflation, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it would end its pandemic-era bond purchases in March, paving the way for three quarter-percentage-point interest rate increases by the end of 2022.
""Consumers are still doing their best to keep the economy's sails full and the recovery on track,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.
Retail sales rose 0.3% last month after surging 1.8% in October. Sales have now risen for four straight months. They increased 18.2% year-on-year in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales rising 0.8%. Estimates ranged from as low as being unchanged to as high as a 1.5% increase.
Several of the top U.S. retailers reported in mid-November that they had noticed an earlier start to holiday shopping. Retail sales could remain moderate in December, though higher savings and rising wages amid a tight labor market are supportive of spending.
Trillions of dollars in COVID-19 pandemic relief from governments across the globe fueled demand for goods, straining supply chains. The resulting shortages, ranging from motor vehicles to furniture and electronics, have raised goods prices.
Consumer prices increased a solid 0.8% in November, with the year-on-year gain of 6.8% the largest since June 1982. Inflation is likely to remain high for a while. A separate report from the Labor Department on Wednesday showed import prices increased 0.7% in November.
""Consumers have been bombarded with messages about the impact of supply shortages on the availability of holiday gifts,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. ""They may well have done a lot of their holiday shopping earlier than usual.""
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
MIXED BAG
The moderation in retail sales, which are mostly goods, was in part due to shortages and higher prices. Receipts at auto dealerships dipped 0.1% after accelerating 1.7% in October. Automobiles remain scarce because of a global semiconductor shortage. Sales at electronics and appliance stores fell 4.6%.
But sales at service stations increased 1.7%, lifted by higher gasoline prices. Receipts at food and beverage stores rose 1.3%, also reflecting rising inflation. 
""Food and gas are forcing hard choices for consumers in other areas this holiday season,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Consumers are no longer the price-takers they were when they were flush with cash from stimulus checks."" 
There were also increases in sales at building material stores as well as at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. Sales at clothing stores rose 0.5%. 
Receipts at restaurants and bars increased 1.0%. Restaurants and bars are the only services category in the retail sales report. These sales were up 37.4% from last November, suggesting spending was reverting back to services. Demand shifted to goods during the pandemic.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales dipped 0.1%. Data for October was revised higher to show these so-called core retail sales accelerating 1.8% instead of the previously reported 1.6%.
Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Though inflation-adjusted, or real, consumer spending was probably flat in November, it is above its third-quarter pace. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity rose at a 1.7% annualized rate in the third quarter.
""We still think that real consumer spending growth will be strong in the fourth quarter on average, with firm earlier momentum before the disappointing November,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Rising COVID-19 infections could slow spending over winter, with the highly transmissible Omicron variant posing an additional risk. The Atlanta Fed lowered its fourth-quarter growth estimate to a 7.0% rate from a 8.7% pace earlier.
The economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the third quarter. Growth estimates for this quarter were boosted by a third report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showing businesses' inventories accelerated 1.2% in October.

""The winter Delta wave is now upon us,"" said Diane Swonk
chief economist at Grant Thornton in Chicago. ""The bulk of the weakness associated with the current wave of infections is expected to show up in the first quarter data.""

779,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 10:26AM ET</span>",,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business inventory accumulation increased strongly in October, suggesting that restocking could again support economic growth this quarter even as motor vehicle inventories remain depressed because of shortages.
Business inventories rose 1.2% after gaining 0.8% in September, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast inventories rising 1.1%. Inventories increased 7.8% on a year-on-year basis in October. Retail inventories edged up 0.1% in October as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 0.1% dip in September. Motor vehicle inventories decreased 1.0% instead of 0.7% as estimated last month.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.5%, rather than 0.4% as estimated last month.
A moderate pace of inventory drawdown in the third quarter accounted for all of the 2.1% annualized rise in GDP last quarter. Inventories were depleted in the first half of the year, and COVID-19 pandemic-related shortages are making it difficult to rebuild stocks.
The urgent need to restock is keeping manufacturing humming and supporting the overall economy.
""Inventory-to-sales ratios have collapsed throughout the pandemic,"" said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities USA in New York. ""While supply constraints have contributed to these declines, robust sales is the primary culprit. Inadequate inventories, and the need to replenish them, should support robust nominal GDP in 2022.""
There are concerns from some economists that businesses wary of delays getting stock could over-order and end up with excess inventory, which could put the economic expansion in jeopardy.

Wholesale inventories rose 2.3% in October. Stocks at manufacturers increased 0.8%.
Business sales advanced 2.1% in October after rising 1.2% in September. At October's sales pace, it would take 1.24 months for businesses to clear shelves, down from 1.26 months in September.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's prime minister said on Wednesday that the government had overstated the value of some construction orders received from builders for years, in a blow to the credibility of official statistics widely used by investors and economists.
Officials and analysts said the builders involved were relatively small firms and therefore this practice was likely to have had only a minimal impact on gross domestic product (GDP) figures.
""It is regrettable that such a thing has happened,"" Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said. ""The government will examine as soon as possible what steps it can take to avoid such an incident from happening again.""
He made the comment in parliament after the Asahi newspaper reported that the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism had been ""rewriting"" data received from about 12,000 companies since 2013 at a pace of about 10,000 entries per year.
Kishida said that ""improvements"" had been made since January 2020 and that there was no direct impact on GDP data for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021.
However, the news is likely to raise questions about the reliability of data that is a cornerstone for economists and investors looking to understand and forecast trends in the world's third-largest economy.
It is not the first time that issues have been raised about government data. Similar concern was voiced about a flaw in health ministry wage data found in 2018.
""The biggest problem is not the effect on the GDP per se but the damage to reliability of (official) statistics,"" said Saisuke Sakai, senior economist at Mizuho Research and Technologies.
""We can't help doubting this kind of issue could happen across government ministries,"" Sakai said.
'UNDER PRESSURE'
The construction orders data combines public and private orders, which in fiscal 2020 totalled roughly 80 trillion yen ($700 billion). The figures also feed into Japan's GDP calculations. 
For the construction survey, the ministry collects monthly orders data from building companies through local prefectural authorities.
Companies that fall behind in submitting data often sent in several months' worth of figures at a time. In these instances, the ministry would instruct local authorities to rewrite the orders for the combined months as the figure for the latest, single month.
""We engaged in such a practice to reflect the actual situation regarding orders placed. If we had refused to collect data that way, the number of samples would have dwindled,"" said a ministry official directly in charge of the data.
The official added that the practice may have begun in around 2000, when the ministry started tracking the data.
""We were under pressure not to reduce samples, even though looking back, this practice was weird.""
Furthermore, when an entry was missing from a company, the ministry would put in a tentative figure by taking the average of the orders from the rest of the industry in that month, resulting in double-counting once the missing sum arrived.
Considering Japan has hundreds of thousands of construction companies, the proportion of those concerned was very small, said Akiyoshi Takumori, chief economist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) DS Asset Management.
""How much influence do they have? The kind of sloppy company which puts out numbers late is probably not big.""
Still, Land Minister Tetsuo Saito, a veteran lawmaker of the Komeito party, the smaller of the two ruling coalition parties, confirmed the practice in parliament and said it was ""extremely regrettable"".
Ministry officials said they had not directly reported the data flaws to Saito's predecessor, Kazuyoshi Akaba.
Asked about the issue, the government's top spokesperson said only that the land ministry had been instructed to analyse ""as soon as possible"" what had led to the practice.
""We will first wait for the results of that investigation,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters.

Restating data this way, which may have broken the law, continued until January 2020 after the Board of Audit pointed it out to the ministry, the ministry said. It added that the original construction survey forms from before 2019 had already been discarded so it would be hard to restore monthly figures from previous years.

The value of overall retail purchases increased 0.3% last month, following an upwardly revised 1.8% advance in October, Commerce Department figures showed Wednesday. Excluding gas and motor vehicles, sales climbed 0.2% in November. The figures aren’t adjusted for inflation.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.8% gain in overall retail sales from the prior month. 
The softer-than-expected report may reflect the pulling forward of holiday sales as many Americans, aware of supply-chain slowdowns, shopped earlier than usual. 
U.S. consumer prices are rising at the fastest rate in almost 40 years. Accelerating inflation risks may give consumers additional pause in coming months, especially as remaining fiscal supports like a moratorium on federal student loan payments end early next year.
Inflation-adjusted consumer spending data for November will be released next week.
Five of the 13 retail categories showed declines in receipts last month, led by a drop at electronics and appliances merchants. Sales at non-store retailers, which includes e-commerce, were little changed in November.
Rising prices could be driving some of the increases in categories like gasoline stations and grocery stores. 
So-called control group sales -- which are used to calculate gross domestic product and exclude food services, auto dealers, building materials stores and gasoline stations -- fell 0.1% in November from a month earlier.

LONDON (Reuters) -British inflation surged to its highest in more than 10 years in November, jumping to 5.1% and potentially unsettling the Bank of England a day before it announces whether it is raising interest rates for the first time since COVID-19 struck.
Price pressure from a broad range of consumer goods and services - but especially petrol, clothing and footwear - lay behind the increase in inflation to its highest since September 2011, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
The reading exceeded all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists, which had pointed to a rise of 4.7% from October's 4.2%. 
Last month the BoE, which announces its December policy decision on Thursday, had predicted consumer price inflation - just 0.7% at the start of 2021 - would peak at around 5% next April, when regulated household energy bills increase.
Inflation has soared globally this year due to higher energy prices and COVID-related supply-chain bottlenecks. In Britain, post-Brexit trade and migration barriers have also caused problems.
The BoE has said interest rates will almost certainly need to rise to bring down inflation pressures, but held off on a widely expected move last month due to uncertainty about the impact of the end of the government's job furlough programme.
Many economists still expect the BoE to stay on hold again on Thursday, because of the potential impact on economic growth of rapidly rising cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant, despite the inflation surprise.
""Under usual circumstances, it would be consistent with an imminent rate rise,"" said HSBC economist Chris Hare. On balance, Omicron headwinds pointed to no rise on Thursday. ""But the decision is not a straightforward one by any means,"" he added.
INFLATION IN ACTION
The International Monetary Fund - which predicts British inflation will hit a 30-year high of 5.5% next year - on Tuesday urged the BoE not to succumb to ""inaction bias"".
However, any immediate rise in borrowing costs would do little to curb a short-term rise in inflation. 
Samuel Tombs, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said it could reach 6% next April but fall rapidly thereafter and undershoot the BoE's 2% target in 2023.
Market reaction to Wednesday's data was initially muted. Sterling rose modestly against the dollar and the euro, and interest-rate sensitive two-year gilt yields hit a one-week high.
Interest rate futures now price in a 63% chance of a rate rise on Thursday - compared with below 50% on Wednesday, and see a slightly faster pace of tightening in 2022. 
A rate rise to 0.25% from 0.1% was already fully priced in for February, which would make the BoE the first of the world's major central banks to increase interest rates since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Wednesday's data showed core consumer price inflation, which excludes more volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, rose to 4.0% from October's 3.4%, its highest since 1992. Fuel prices rose 28.5%.
The retail price inflation (RPI) measure - used for inflation-linked government bonds and wage-bargaining but which the ONS says is no longer accurate - rose to 7.1% from 6.0%, its highest since March 1991.

783,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 04:16AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Spain's inflation remained at a 29-year-high in November for the second month in a row, propelled by food and fuel prices, final monthly data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) showed on Wednesday. 
Consumer prices rose 5.5% year-on-year in November, the fastest pace since 1992, according to final data from INE, up from 5.4% in October. 
The flash estimate for November released late last month was 5.6%. The monthly inflation rate in November was 0.3%. 
Food and transport prices rose 3.3% and 13.5% from a year ago, the INE said in its more detailed second reading, pushed by high fuel prices.
Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was 1.7% year-on-year, compared with a reading of 1.4% a month earlier, INE added.

High inflation threatens Spain's growth prospects. Bank of Spain Governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos said on Tuesday that rising inflation, supply bottlenecks and a surge in COVID-19 cases in Europe would hit the Spanish economy and prompt a slight downward revision of growth forecasts in the fourth quarter and early 2022.
Meanwhile, the European Central Bank is maintaining its message that rapid price growth is temporary. ECB President Christine Lagarde said earlier this month that euro zone inflation had already peaked and may soon begin a decline that will continue through next year.

Investing.com -- Annual consumer price inflation in the UK surged to 5.1% in November, adding to pressure to the Bank of England to raise interest rates.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported on Wednesday that consumer prices rose at their fastest rate since September 2008, from 4.2% in October. Analysts had expected a rate of 4.7% ahead of time. The monthly rate of inflation rose 0.7%, compared with a fall of 0.1% in the same month the previous year.
The ONS attributed the rise in inflation to transport, housing and household services.
The inflation data is the last reading on consumer prices that BoE policymakers will receive before their final policy meeting of the year on Thursday. Strength in the labor market and elevated inflation underline the case for higher interest rates. But renewed fears over the prospect of an economic slowdown from the rapid spread of the Omicron variant of Covid -19 mean policymakers are likely to keep rates on hold.
On Tuesday, the latest UK employment report showed that jobs growth remained strong and vacancies stayed at record levels in November.
The BoE had been expected to hike rates in November, in what would have been the first increase since the pandemic struck, but instead it kept rates unchanged, despite some hawkish guidance from top policymakers in the weeks leading up to the meeting. 
Last week data showed that the UK economy flatlined in October, even before the emergence of Omicron, causing markets to push back bets for a rate hike to February."

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's factory output grew faster than expected in November, supported by stronger energy production and a moderation in sky-high materials costs, but new curbs to fight rising COVID-19 cases hit retailers in the world's second-largest economy.
The data, along with a slowdown in investment growth, underlines the persistent headwinds facing the economy, which have already prompted policymakers this month to ratchet up support.
""The economy remained quite weak in November,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.
""Domestic consumption weakened further, which is driven by the zero tolerance policy that hurts the service sector and the continued slowdown in the property sector.""
Factory production rose 3.8% in November from a year earlier, official data showed on Wednesday, beating expectations for a 3.6% rise and accelerating from a 3.5% increase in October.
China's coal output hit a record in November as Beijing urged miners to ramp up production to ensure sufficient energy supplies in the winter heating season, while daily crude oil throughput rebounded in November.
Retail sales, however, rose 3.9% in November from a year earlier, below the 4.6% growth expected in the poll and October's 4.9% rise.
Fixed asset investment rose 5.2% in the first 11 months from the same period a year earlier, slower than the 5.4% increase tipped by a Reuters poll and the 6.1% in January-October.
China's economy, which is losing steam after a solid recovery from the pandemic last year, faces multiple challenges heading into 2022, due to a property downturn and strict COVID-19 curbs that have hit consumer spending.
Despite the pick-up in industrial activity in November, new COVID-19 outbreaks are creating fresh problems for policymakers as the Omicron variant of the virus threatens the global economic outlook.
More than a dozen Chinese-listed companies said they had suspended production in coronavirus-hit parts of Zhejiang province in response to new COVID-19 curbs, causing their share prices to plunge this week.
Separate data on Wednesday showed China's property downturn persisted in the final quarter of 2021 with home prices, sales, investment and construction mired in negative territory last month, weighed by weak demand and a cash crunch among developers.
Some analysts expect fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth to dip below 4% from the 4.9% pace in the previous quarter, although the full-year growth could still be about 8%, above the official target of over 6%.
China's red-hot factory-gate inflation cooled slightly, driven by a government crackdown on runaway commodity prices and an easing power crunch.
MORE SUPPORT LIKELY
At a key agenda-setting meeting last week, China's top leaders pledged to focus on stabilising the economy and keeping growth within a reasonable range in 2022.
Signalling a sense of urgency, top leaders have also vowed to front-load stimulus next year ahead of the 20th Communist Party Congress, where key political leadership changes are likely to announced.
To shore up flagging growth, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has cut the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve, its second such move this year. It also cut the rates on its relending facility to support the rural sector and small firms.
On Wednesday, the PBOC injected funds into the financial system through medium-term loans, but kept the interest rate on that facility unchanged.
Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, said this week he expected the downward pressure on the economy to persist in the first half of 2022, prompting the central bank to deliver another half percentage point RRR cut.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) expects one round of 5-10 basis point cuts on the rates of open market operations, the medium-term lending facility and benchmark loan prime rate by March 2022 and one more RRR cut in the first quarter.

Citi expects China to keep its budget deficit of 3.2% of GDP in 2022, in line with 2021, and a quota of 3.8 trillion yuan ($597.02 billion) on special local government bonds to fund infrastructure projects, up from 3.65 trillion yuan this year.

Investing.com – China's industrial production grew faster than expected in November, with stronger energy production and moderating raw materials prices lending support. However, growth in retail sales slowed as fresh COVID-19 outbreaks led to tighter restrictive measures in the country.
Chinese data released earlier in the day showed that industrial production grew 3.8% year-on-year, above the 3.6% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the previous month’s 3.5% growth. However, Chinese industrial production in the year to date grew 10.1% year-on-year, lower than October’s 10.9% growth.
The data also showed that retail sales grew 3.9% year-on-year, lower than the 4.6% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and October’s 4.9% growth. Fixed asset investment grew 5.2% year-on-year, also lower than the 5.4% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the previous month’s 6.1% growth.
The largely disappointing data emphasized the headwinds faced by the world’s second-largest economy’s recovery. These include wobbles in the property sector and COVID-19 outbreaks leading to tight restrictive measures and reduced consumer spending.
""The economy remained quite weak in November. Domestic consumption weakened further, which is driven by the zero-tolerance policy that hurts the service sector and the continued slowdown in the property sector,"" Pinpoint Asset Management chief economist Zhiwei Zhang told Reuters.

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment released on Wednesday fell 1.0% in December, wiping out November's 0.6% gain.
The index reading was down 6.9% on December last year, though at 104.3 it meant optimists still outnumbered pessimists.
Westpac chief economist Bill Evans noted there were sharp falls in New South Wales and Victoria where COVID-19 cases were highest. The survey also found more concern about rising inflation, which may have hurt spending plans.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased more than expected in November as supply constraints persisted, leading to the biggest annual gain since the series was revamped 11 years ago and supporting views that inflation could remain uncomfortably high for some time.
The report from the Labor Department on Tuesday, which also showed strong growth in underlying producer inflation, followed on the heels of news last Friday that annual consumer prices surged by the most since 1982 in November. Soaring inflation complicates President Joe Biden economic agenda, including a $1.75 trillion social policy and climate bill stuck in Congress. 
Together with a tightening labor market, rising price pressures will likely see the Federal Reserve announcing that it will accelerate the tapering of its massive bond purchases when officials end a two-day meeting on Wednesday and potentially start raising interest rates sooner than previously expected.
""Price metrics have been running well above target for much longer than anticipated,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""These data support the Fed's switch to a faster taper that will likely precede a quicker tightening of policy next year.""
The producer price index for final demand jumped 0.8% last month after advancing 0.6% in October. The broad-based increase in the PPI was led by a 0.7% rise in services, which followed a 0.2% gain in October. The acceleration in services reflected a 2.9% jump in prices for portfolio management. 
There were also increases in prices for hotel and motel accommodation as well as airline fares and transportation of freight and mail. But prices for wholesale furnishings and bundled wired telecommunications access services fell.
Wholesale goods prices rose 1.2% after increasing 1.3% in October. Prices for iron and steel scrap rose 10.7%. There were also increases in wholesale gasoline and food prices. But prices for diesel fuel fell as did the cost of light motor trucks. 
In the 12 months through November, the PPI shot up 9.6%. That was the largest gain since November 2010 and followed an 8.8% increase in October. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI climbing 0.5% on a monthly basis and surging 9.2% year-on-year.
The government reported last Friday that the consumer price index surged 6.4% in the 12 months through November, the biggest year-on-year rise since June 1982.
Trillions of dollars in COVID-19 pandemic relief from governments across the globe fueled demand for goods, leaving supply chains overstretched. The normalization of economic activity has also juiced demand for services, with the delivery of some being hampered by worker shortages, driving up prices.
Stocks on Wall Street were mostly lower. The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
GLIMMERS OF HOPE
There are, however, some hopeful signs that the supply bottlenecks could be starting to ease. An Institute for Supply Management survey this month showed ""some indications of slight labor and supplier delivery improvement"" in November. 
Crude oil prices have eased off recent highs and were approaching $73 a barrel on Tuesday after the International Energy Agency said that the Omicron coronavirus variant was set to dent the global demand recovery. Shipping costs are also off their recent peaks. 
""Supply chain pressures should ease in the next few months as holiday shopping lets up and producers have more time to adjust capacity, but the impacts on producer prices and then to consumer prices will not be immediate,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York.
""In the meantime, year-on-year changes in producer prices will remain high.""
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices surged 0.7%. The so-called core PPI gained 0.4% in October. In the 12 months through November, the core PPI jumped 6.9%, the largest rise since 12-month data were first calculated in August 2014, after marching 6.3% in October.
The Fed tracks the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, for its flexible 2% inflation target.
Portfolio management prices, hotel and motel accommodation as well as airline fares go into the calculation of the core PCE price index. With these data and CPI numbers in hand, economists are forecasting that the core PCE price index rose at least 0.4% in November. That would lift the year-on-year increase in the core PCE price index to about 4.6%, which would the strongest annual reading since 1989. 

""While modal scenarios where inflation returns toward the 2% target over multiple years still make sense, risks of a more extended sojourn above target continue to rise and are clearly at their most elevated in at least 40 years,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
The core PCE price index accelerated 4.1% in the 12 months through October, the most since January 1991. Data for November will be released next Thursday.

The producer price index for final demand increased 0.8% from the prior month and 9.6% from a year earlier, Labor Department data showed Tuesday. The annual advance was the largest in figures back to 2010. 
The monthly jump was the largest since July and exceeded the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey that called for a 0.5% gain. 
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core PPI increased 0.7% and was up by a record 7.7% from a year ago. Prices of goods and services both advanced last month.
Stock-index futures extended losses as the data reinforced expectations that Federal Reserve policy makers will tighten monetary policy next year.
Materials costs have risen rapidly this year amid transportation bottlenecks, robust demand, and labor constraints. Many businesses have successfully passed those added costs on to customers through higher prices, and the latest report suggests additional consumer price increases in the coming months.   
Data out last week showed the consumer price index rose 6.8% last month from a year ago, the fastest annual pace in nearly 40 years. While first concentrated in a handful of categories associated with the economy’s reopening, inflation has broadened out. 
The larger-than-expected, sustained increase in inflation has put pressure on policy makers to act. The Fed, which will wrap up its final meeting of the year Wednesday, is anticipated to accelerate the wind down of its bond buying program, an action that would allow the central bank to begin increasing interest rates next year.
Producer prices excluding food, energy, and trade services -- a measure often preferred by economists because it strips out the most volatile components -- rose 0.7% from the prior month. Compared with a year earlier, the gauge jumped a record 6.9%.
Goods prices increased 1.2% in November from a month earlier, reflecting broad advances that included iron and steel scrap, gasoline, and fruits and vegetables.
Services costs rose 0.7%, in part reflecting a jump in prices for investment portfolio management.
Costs of processed goods for intermediate demand, which reflect prices earlier in the production pipeline, rose 1.5% from a month earlier. Compared with a year earlier, the measure jumped 26.5% -- the largest since 1974.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Persistent supply bottlenecks and a fourth wave of coronavirus infections in Germany are further delaying the recovery of Europe's largest economy from the pandemic, the Ifo institute said on Tuesday as it slashed its growth forecast for next year.
The Ifo institute expects the German economy to shrink by 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the final three months of this year and to stagnate in the first three months of next year.
Coupled with the current surge in overall prices, Germany is now facing several winter months of zero growth and unusually high inflation, a combination described by economists as stagflation.
For 2022 as a whole, Ifo slashed its economic growth forecast to 3.7% from 5.1% projected in September, and also confirmed its already reduced forecast of 2.5% for this year. For 2023 it lifted its growth forecast to 2.9% from 1.5%.
""The strong recovery initially expected for 2022 will be further pushed back,"" Ifo chief economist Timo Wollmershaeuser said.
INFLATION
The bleak outlook was shared by the economy ministry, which on Tuesday said in its monthly report that the government expected to see ""rather weak"" economic output in the final quarter of the year.
Activity in the services sector will likely slow as Germany faces renewed curbs aimed at breaking its fourth wave of COVID infections, while supply bottlenecks for microchips especially in the car industry hamstrung manufacturing, the ministry said.
However, in view of the high order backlog, the ministry had a positive outlook for German exports.
The inflation rate is seen rising further in the short term, reducing the purchasing power of German consumers in light of meagre wage growth so far.
Ifo expects the national consumer price index (CPI) to rise by 3.1% this year and by 3.3% next year - both rates clearly above the European Central Bank's price stability target of 2% for the euro zone as a whole.
""Rising costs associated with delivery bottlenecks play a driving role, as does the delayed adjustment to the increased energy and raw material prices,"" Wollmershaeuser said.
In 2023, Ifo expects inflation rate to slow to 1.8%.
Ifo head Clemens Fuest called on the ECB to announce an end to its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) at its regular meeting on Thursday.

""We have very strong signals from companies that significant price increases are imminent,"" Fuest said.
At their Dec. 16 Governing Council meeting ECB policymakers will debate options on how to adapt the bank's regular asset purchase programme (APP) once the much larger pandemic-fighting PEPP scheme ends in March.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said industrial production in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 1.1% month-on-month in October for a 3.3% year-on-year gain.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 1.2% monthly rise and a 3.2% annual increase.

Eurostat said that measured against September, industrial output of capital goods, used in investment, rebounded 3.0% after falls in August and September. Year-on-year capital goods production rose 5.2%.
Durable consumer goods were also sharply higher, rising 1.7% on the month and 2.3% on the year, while non-durable consumer goods output was 6.9% higher than a year earlier, continuing a trend of strong gains in previous months.

LONDON (Reuters) -British employers hired a record number of staff in November, adding to signs that the labour market withstood the end of the government's furlough scheme and underscoring the Bank of England's dilemma as it meets on interest rates this week.
Tax office data showed 257,000 people joined company payrolls last month, the most since records began in 2014.
The BoE, under pressure to address fast-rising inflation, wants to be sure that the expiry of the furlough scheme at the end of September did not cause a jump in unemployment before any decision to raise rates for the first time since the pandemic.
But the fast spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant has raised fears of a new economic slowdown and prompted investors to bet against a rate hike by the BoE as soon as Thursday, after its December Monetary Policy Committee meeting.
""The combination of a tight labour market and low unemployment evident in today's data could on their own be sufficient to merit a rate rise,"" KPMG UK's Chief Economist Yael Selfin said.
""Nonetheless, with the emergence of the Omicron variant over the recent weeks, we now expect the MPC to unanimously hold off raising rates until next year.""
The ONS's director of economic statistics, Darren Morgan, cautioned that the payrolls figures could include people recently made redundant but still working out their notice and the data can be volatile.
October's increase was slashed to 74,000 from an originally reported 160,000.
WAGE GROWTH SLOWS AS INFLATION GROWS
While the overall picture from the data was one of strong jobs growth and a record number of vacancies, employers are worried that any further restrictions to slow the spread of COVID-19 could hit the economy's recovery from its 2020 slump.
""The economy should remain as open as is feasibly safe to do so in the coming weeks,"" Matthew Percival, director of employment at the Confederation of British Industry, said.
Official data showed the unemployment rate fell to 4.2% in the three months to October, as expected by economists polled by Reuters and down from 4.3% in the three months to September.
Employment rose by 149,000 in the August-October period, less than a predicted increase of 228,000 in the Reuters poll, while the number of unemployed fell by 127,000.
The ONS said average weekly earnings were 4.9% higher than in the same three months of 2020, the smallest annual increase since March.
Excluding bonuses, earnings were 4.3% higher than a year earlier, the smallest rise since the three months to February.
Adjusted for inflation, which is expected to hit almost 5% in data due to be released on Wednesday, total pay growth was the weakest since September last year, representing another potential drag on the economy's recovery.
The ONS said it was no longer estimating underlying pay growth excluding the impact of the furlough scheme and other pandemic-related factors which have distorted the data.

Job vacancies hit an all-time high of 1.219 million in the three months to November, although the pace of growth in new openings continued to slow. In November alone, vacancies edged down for the first time since February when Britain was in a tight lockdown. 
Much of the recent growth in employment was among part-time workers, the ONS said.

VDMA revised down its production growth forecast for the year to 7% from its September estimate of 10%. 
Engineering orders rose by 34% in real terms in the first ten months of 2021, but production rose by only 7.2% in the same period, VDMA added.

""We could have produced more had the various supply bottlenecks not been so persistent,"" VDMA President Karl Haeusgen said in a statement.
The association, which raised its production forecast for 2022, said it expects the bottlenecks to persist at least until the second quarter of next year.

Less than a fifth of businesses said that they believe the current situation will improve by Feb. 2022, said the economy ministry in its monthly report. 
Despite the bottlenecks, the ministry had a positive outlook for German exports in view of the high order backlog.

Tuesday's survey from National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) (NAB) showed its index of business conditions rose 2 points in November to +12, comfortably above its long-run average.
The gain was driven by a 5 point jump in employment to an historically strong +11, while the index of sales index added 1 point to +16 and profitability held at +8.
The survey's measure of confidence eased 8 points to +12, but that followed an 11 point surge the month before and again remained well above the long-run average.
""Overall, these results indicate a strong recovery is underway,"" said NAB chief economist Alan Oster.
""There is still scope for things to improve further in coming months, particularly in recreation & personal services which was still in negative territory in November despite many restrictions easing in the month.""

Firms also reported a sharp rise in capacity utilisation to 83.2%, suggesting they will need to invest more to expand output, while the forward orders index remained strong at +14.
There were more signs of inflation in the survey with retail and producer prices firming, while labour costs were lifted by the hefty gain in employment.

Investing.com -- The U.K. labor market continued to improve in October after the end of the government's furlough scheme, smoothing the way for the Bank of England to raise interest rates if it wants to. 
Employment rose by 149,000 in the three months through October, relative to the previous three months, according to figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Tuesday.  That was less than the 228,000 expected. The number of those claiming jobless benefits fell by 49,800 in November, after a smaller decline of 14,900 in October.
The U.K. employment rate was up 0.2% on the previous quarter and just 1.1% shy of its rate before the Covid pandemic hit. Unemployment was estimated by the ONS at 4.2% of the workforce for the period, 0.4% lower than the previous quarter’s figures. Total hours worked in the economy were also up but remain below pre-coronavirus levels.
U.K. employment figures have improved in tandem with the easing of Covid restrictions. But fears are rising that Boris Johnson’s government will reimpose steadily harsher restrictions to deal with the fresh wave of Covid-19 infections and potentially stall the economic recovery.
Rising inflation had led to speculation that the Bank of England would raise interest rates imminently.
“My instinct is still that the Bank of England will raise interest rates in early ’22,” said Chris Bailey, an analyst with Financial Orbit via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). “They should do it this week but undoubtedly will choose not to,” he added.
Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said the figures showed little evidence of an impact from the ending of furlough in the U.K. and also suggested that the hit to U.K. labor supply from European workers who returned home during Covid was perhaps milder than first feared.
He noted that the number of jobs in the U.K. economy is now above its pre-pandemic level.
“Some of the increase to above pre-pandemic levels could be workers taking on additional employment,” Donovan said, adding: “That is supported by research that suggests that the growth in jobs recently has been particularly a growth in part-time jobs.”

798,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 02:41PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Health insurance costs for employers rose the most in over a decade this year as Americans resumed non-urgent procedures delayed earlier due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a survey published on Monday.
The survey by benefits company Mercer of firms that employ about 118 million people showed the average cost of employer-sponsored health insurance per employee jumped 6.3% this year to $14,542 - the largest rise since 2010.
The increase was just 3.4% in 2020 when the pandemic had strained hospital capacity and forced people to put off elective procedures.
""I think that's (catch-up care) certainly part of the cost driver,"" Kate Brown, Mercer's Center for Health Innovation Leader, told Reuters.
Brown said several other factors, including claims related to the treatment of long-term effects of COVID-19 and specialty drug pricing, could also be driving the cost rise and may continue into 2022.
The survey, which included 1,745 public and private employers, showed firms expect a ""fairly typical"" cost increase of 4.4% next year.
But most of them were unwilling to try to reduce the cost increase as they double down on making physical and mental healthcare more affordable for employees dealing with the stress of the nearly two-year-long pandemic.
Tracy Watts, national leader for U.S. health policy at Mercer, said generous health benefits could help companies in attracting and retaining staff in the tight labor market.

Adding or expanding programs to increase access to behavioral healthcare was among the top three priorities for all large employers, the survey showed.
""It's clearly become very salient throughout the pandemic that mental health is a critical need for all people and it's become really more top of mind for most employers over the last two years,"" Brown said.

(Reuters) - U.S. consumers' short-term inflation expectations pushed higher in November and expectations for future earnings growth dropped, suggesting they anticipate price increases will outpace wage gains at an even faster rate in the near term, according to a survey released on Monday by the New York Federal Reserve. 
Prices for food and other goods are rising at the fastest pace since 1982, according to data released by the Labor Department last week, posing political challenges for President Joe Biden's administration and cementing expectations the Fed will raise interest rates next year.
Higher inflation, caused in part by pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and demand shifts, is also eroding wage gains, and some consumers expect that situation to worsen in the near term, according to the New York Fed survey. While near-term inflation expectations rose, year-ahead earnings expectations declined in November. 
Consumers said they expect inflation to reach a median of 6.0% in one year, up from an expectation of 5.7% in October. Expectations for year-ahead earnings growth dropped to 2.8% in November from 3.0% in the previous month. 
That would leave inflation growing 3.2 percentage points faster than earnings in one year, the widest gap since the survey launched in 2013. 
Median expectations for what inflation could be in three years, however, dropped to 4.0% from 4.2%, the first decline since June and only the second drop since October 2020. And uncertainty over what future inflation could look like also rose to new highs for the New York Fed survey.
INFLATION OVERSHADOWS EMPLOYMENT
Inflation is now the central economic concern voiced by American consumers, according to the latest Consumer Sentiment Index survey from the University of Michigan.
""When directly asked whether inflation or unemployment was the more serious problem facing the nation, 76% selected inflation while just 21% selected unemployment,"" Richard Curtin, the survey's director, said in a statement on Friday with the release of the latest reading covering early December. 
Fed officials, stung by persistently high inflation and encouraged by lower-than-expected unemployment, are likely to announce after their policy meeting this week that they plan to wind down their bond-buying program more quickly to clear the way for rate increases. 
Some policymakers say they are worried low interest rates could be fueling stronger gains in stock market prices, real estate values and other asset prices. 

The survey showed expectations for future home price growth declined slightly last month, but consumers are still expecting more robust growth than they did before the coronavirus pandemic. Consumers said they expect home prices to rise by a median of 5% in one year, down from 5.6% in October but well above the 3.1% expected in February 2020. 
The monthly survey of consumer expectations is based on a rotating panel of approximately 1,300 households.
