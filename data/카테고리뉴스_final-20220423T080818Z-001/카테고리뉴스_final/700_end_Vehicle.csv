Asked if he expects to be holding Tesla stock in eight to 10 years, Baron said yes – even though, as he noted, his firm sold about a billion dollars’ worth of Tesla stock in a bid to reduce investors’ risk and might trim its position again in the future.', '“I was getting widely criticized for having such a large percentage of my [firm’s] assets in one stock, and people said how can you be so crazy,” Baron said, explaining the decision to trim the firm’s Tesla stake. “I wanted them to think I wasn’t crazy.”', 'Baron told CNBC that investors should look past near-term speed bumps like the company’s recent miss on deliveries. Tesla delivered about 310,000 vehicles in the first quarter, falling about 7,000 vehicles short of Wall Street’s consensus estimate.', '“People said they should have done 317,000 cars in the quarter,” Baron said. “In four years they’ll do a million cars a quarter, and if you go 10 years out it’s something like five million cars a quarter.”', 'At 5 million vehicles a quarter, or 20 million per year, Tesla’s automotive business would be roughly the size of Toyota and Volkswagen – currently the world’s two largest automakers – combined.', 'Baron remains an ardent fan of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and said that he isn’t worried that Musk’s recent decision to invest in Twitter will become a distraction. Musk also joined the social media company’s board.', '“I just think this [investment in Twitter] is helping his marketing,” Baron said. “There’s no way he’s taking his eye off the ball or anything.”', 'Shares of Tesla were effectively flat in premarket trading Thursday.']"
15,Health savings eyed as potential investment vehicles,2013-09-09T12:34:19+0000,"['  You already can invest your retirement money and your kid’s  college savings on Wall Street. Next on the list: your health  care.', '  A growing number of employees are required by companies to set up  special savings accounts to cover part of their medical bills.  Over time, they are also encouraged to invest a portion of it in  stocks, bonds or a mutual fund, just like they do with a 401(k)  or IRA.', '  Americans now have $18 billion in Health Savings Accounts, a type  of plan that allows them to save pre-tax dollars for future  medical expenses, according to the Employee Benefit Research  Institute, a non-partisan group that studies worker benefits.  That’s up more than 40 percent from a year ago. The amount of  money in HSAs is expected to double by the end of 2015, according  to consulting firm Devenir.', '  “They have nowhere to go but up,” says Paul Fronstin, a  researcher at EBRI.', '  An HSA is similar to the better-known Flexible Spending Account.  Like in an FSA, an employee puts pre-tax dollars into a special  account to use toward medical expenses not covered by insurance,  from dental check-ups to prescription drug co-pays.', '  But the similarities end there. Unlike an FSA, HSAs do not have a  “use it or lose it” rule, so the money carries over year to year.  A majority of companies who offer HSAs also contribute to the  account, more than $1,000 a year for families, according to EBRI.  HSAs are also portable. An employee can take their HSA to their  next job or save the money for future use. The accounts can also  provide significant tax advantages when used correctly.', '  For workers, HSAs offer flexibility, although they are not  appropriate for everyone.', '  For employers the accounts can provide savings. The plans have  been shown to slow the rise in health care costs, or even lower  them.', '  For Wall Street, HSA’s are another way to make money. Why? The  savings in HSAs can be invested once they hit a certain  threshold, typically $2,000.', '  Nearly all HSA accounts are used in combination with a type of  health insurance known as a high-deductible health plan, or HDHP.  These plans are also sometimes known as a “Consumer Driven Health  Plan.” As their name implies, HDHPs have high deductibles, often  $1,200 or greater for a single person, or $2,400 for a family.', '  HDHPs provide coverage for medical emergencies, leaving the  day-to-day health care costs to the employee. HSAs can be used  along with a HDHP to help offset those day-to-day costs.', '  When used correctly, HSAs can also provide a triple tax  advantage, something even a 401(k) or IRA cannot do. The money  put into an HSA is not subject to federal income tax and if the  money is invested, any growth is tax-free as well. Any money used  toward eligible medical expenses can be tax-free too.', '  If your employer hasn’t offered an HDHP plan yet, it’s only a  matter of time. By next year, 80 percent of all large employers  will offer a HDHP, according to 2013 employer survey by Towers  Watson. The vast majority of those HDHP plans will include an  HSA, according to the survey.', '  “Companies are becoming more interested in offering medical  benefits that put a lot of the ownership on the employee,” says  Elizabeth Ryan, head of Wells Fargo’s Health Benefit Services.', '  A 2011 study by the non-partisan RAND Corporation showed that  families who were enrolled in a these types of plans reduced  their health care spending by 14 percent. However, families also  spent less on preventative care.', '  “The whole idea of these account-based plans is that when people  have skin in the game they’ll make super-wise decisions regarding  their health care spending,” says Amelia Haviland, who  co-authored the study and is an associate professor in statistics  and health policy at Carnegie Mellon University.', '  Banks have embraced HSAs, and banking industry experts say the  plans could become a big business for Wall Street, just as  401(k)s did. Banks earn money just by opening the accounts for  employees and charging fees on the debit cards tied to them.', '  They also earn a fee, typically 1 percent, for managing the  mutual funds where people invest HSA money. Of the $18 billion  Americans have set aside in HSAs, $2.3 billion will be invested  this year, according to Devenir. The amount invested five years  ago was just a tenth of that, $200 million.', '  Devenir’s President and Co-Founder Erik Remjeske estimates that  HSAs have generated revenue of about $200 million for the  industry in the past year, including all the fees from investing  to administration.', '  Wells Fargo has been offering HSAs since they were created 10  years ago as part of the 2003 Medicare overhaul. Wells Fargo’s  Ryan says the bank handles more than $1 billion in assets in  HSAs, spread across 400,000 accounts. While most of Wells  business is handling HSAs for employers, there is a growing  business of individuals opening the plans, Ryan says.', '  “They may have purchased insurance on their own, and they may  already be banking with Wells Fargo, so it’s a natural  progression because they have other financial products with us,”  she says.', '  Of the people who have an HSA, 56 percent are below the age of  45, according to a 2012 survey by JPMorgan Chase, which also  offers HSA plans. Only two percent of JPMorgan’s customers over  65 have an HSA.', '  Their overall use remains small. Industry observers say HSAs have  two large hurdles to overcome: Most people find HSA-HDHP plans  confusing or believe the plans don’t offer enough coverage, and  HSAs can only be used with high-deductible health plans,  restricting their use.', '  If you get an HSA, it should not be used the same way as an FSA,  experts say.', '  FSAs are designed to be used up each year. While it’s OK to spend  a part of your HSA, the long-term goal should be saving for  future medical expenses.', '  Experts warn that HSAs are not a good choice for individuals who  are chronically ill because those people will burn through the  money, eliminating a chance to invest it.', '  Once the HSA reaches the $2,000 threshold, it can be invested.  However, it’s important to invest HSA savings more conservatively  than in an IRA or 401(k), experts say. Medical expenses can come  up unexpectedly and you may need the money quickly.', '  Unlike a FSA, HSAs carry over year to year, so any money put in  is yours to keep. If you reach 65 years old and find yourself  with too much money in an HSA, you can start using it for  non-medical expenses. However, you’ll lose the tax-free  withdrawal benefit and will have to pay income tax on it.', '  Keep at least a portion of an HSA equal to your health care  plan’s deductible in cash or a money market fund, experts say.  That way, if the stock market falls, at least the amount needed  to cover your deductible won’t be at risk.', '  “Know that what you’re investing is part of your family’s health  insurance,” says Carnegie Mellon’s Haviland. “You don’t want to  gamble.”']"
