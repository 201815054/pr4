0,China’s Huawei tries to blame global chip shortage on U.S. sanctions,2021-04-12T14:28:50+0000,"['The global chip shortage is a highly-complex and multifaceted issue, but Chinese tech company Huawei attempted to blame the U.S. for it on Monday.', 'Eric Xu, Huawei’s rotating chairman, said the sanctions imposed on the firm over the last two years are, “hurting the global semiconductor industry” because they have “disrupted the trusted relationship in the semiconductor industry.”', 'Demand for chips has soared during the coronavirus pandemic as people snapped up games consoles, laptops and TVs to help get through lockdowns. Insatiable demand for electronics isn’t the only reason why semiconductors are in short supply; shifting business models in the industry has also created a bottleneck at outsourced chip factories. The relatively small number of chip manufacturing plants and the lack of competition is another huge issue.', 'But despite all these factors, Huawei tried to lay the bulk of the blame on U.S. sanctions on Monday.', 'Speaking to analysts in Shenzhen at Huawei’s Analyst Summit, Xu said: “The U.S. sanctions is the main reason why we are seeing panic stockpiling of major companies around the world.”', 'He added: “Some of them never stockpiled anything, but because of the sanctions they are now having three months or six months of stockpiles.”', 'Huawei itself has built up a stockpile of chips to try to ensure its business — focused on telecoms equipment and consumer electronics — can continue as normal.', 'Some companies in other industries, such as the automotive sector, have been forced to temporarily shut down operations as a result of the chip shortage. U.S. auto executives and tech leaders were scheduled to meet remotely with President Joe Biden on Monday.', 'The U.S. imposed sanctions on Huawei after accusing it of building backdoors into its equipment that could be exploited by the Chinese Communist Party for espionage purposes.', 'In 2019, Huawei was put on a U.S. blacklist called the Entity List. This restricted American companies from exporting certain technologies to Huawei. Google ended up cutting ties with Huawei, meaning the Chinese giant could not use Google’s Android operating system on its smartphones. Last year, the U.S. moved to cut Huawei off from key chip supplies it needs for its smartphones.', 'Huawei strongly denies the U.S. allegations.', 'Huawei is pursuing new avenues after the sanctions imposed by the Trump administration left its once-leading smartphone business in tatters, while also hindering progress in its semiconductor and 5G businesses.', 'Xu said he doesn’t expect the Biden administration to change the rules any time soon and the company is investing in new areas like health care, farming, and electric cars to try to mitigate the impact of being blacklisted by the U.S.', '“We believe, we’ll continue to live and work under the entity listing for a long period of time,” he said. “The overall strategy as well as the specific initiatives for Huawei are all designed and developed in a way that the company would be able to survive and develop while staying on the entity list for a long time.”', 'Huawei said Monday it plans to invest $1 billion into self-driving and electric car research and development as it looks to compete with the likes of Tesla, Apple, Nio and Xiaomi.', 'Xu claimed that Huawei’s self-driving technology already surpasses Tesla’s as it allows cars to cruise for more than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) without human intervention. Tesla’s vehicles can’t do more than 800 kilometers and drivers are meant to keep their hands on the wheel for safety purposes.', 'Huawei will initially partner with three automakers on self-driving cars including BAIC Group, Chongqing Changan Automobile Co and Guangzhou Automobile Group. A new “HI” (Huawei Inside) logo will be put on cars in the same way that Intel’s logo is put on some computers.', '“Once self-driving is achieved, we’re able to disrupt all of the related industries, and we think that in the foreseeable future, namely in the next decade, the biggest opportunity and breakthrough will be from the automobile industry,” Xu said.', 'Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that Huawei’s Eric Xu is one of three rotating chairmen.']"

They have many waves of infections,” Safanad’s chief investment strategist told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Thursday.', 'Rutledge, who played a major role in President Ronald Reagan’s economic plan, warns that Covid variants will continue to close ports. It’s something that happened last month at China’s Ningbo-Zhoushan port, which is the third busiest in the world.', '“That’s because of a small number of infections that developed there,” Rutledge said. “Seamen have not been inoculated around the world. So, some port, somewhere, is going to close again, and it’ll hit semis, but other things as well.”', 'He notes the closures, along with a lack of supplies and materials, are having widespread global impact.', '“Mostly, you produce more slowly, and that’s what hits GDP,” said Rutledge, a CNBC contributor. “If you can’t get the materials you need, you have to slow down production.”', 'Rutledge also lists worker shortages as a major reason why supply chain troubles will linger.', '“It’s not clear how many of those workers are afraid to go to work, don’t want to go to work or still have plenty of cash,” he said. “But it’s pretty clear to me that this worker shortage is not going to go away in three months or six months or 12 months.”', 'Rutledge attributes half of inflation to supply chain troubles. But what’s hurting production may be bullish for the market and the medium- to longer-term prognosis for the economic recovery.', '“Growth is going to be a net positive, like the initial claims number we saw,” Rutledge said. “The global recovery is proceeding. It’s proceeding in waves.”', 'Disclosure: John Rutledge owns shares of Applied Materials, Taiwan Semiconductor, Nvidia and the iShares Semiconductor ETF.', 'Disclaimer']"

And on Tuesday, it took the wraps off a four-legged “robotic unicorn,” as it pushes into new areas of business.', '“With the development of technology, the form of mobility will evolve from wheels to wings, propellers, 4 legs or 2 feet,” He said, according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language comments. “Technology should help people have better and happier lives. This has always been my goal.”', 'The XPeng founder predicts that all automakers will become both car makers and robotics companies, a process He says could take 10 to 30 years. XPeng is looking at robots as a transportation tool “in a low-speed and random environment.”', '“As it gets better and smarter in the long run, it could help us with some simple repetitive tasks. As the transportation tool becomes more and more intelligent, it could help us take on some tasks. This is how we envision it,” he said.', 'XPeng’s competitor Tesla is also investing in robotics. Last month, CEO Elon Musk said the company will build a humanoid robot called Tesla Bot. Other companies have also shown off robots, including Boston Dynamics and Chinese electronics giant Xiaomi.', 'The X2, XPeng’s second flying car prototype and first that’s able to carry a passenger, was unveiled in July.', 'Founder He said the company is building a research and development team that will “have a few hundred people.”', '“We want to introduce a flying car that can take off or land vertically, a low-to mid-altitude flying car.”', 'A number of auto companies including Hyundai and China-based Geely are developing aerial vehicles. Other firms like Guangzhou-based EHang are also working on passenger drones.', 'The XPeng founder said the company will have a press conference in the future, perhaps in a year, to discuss the dimensions and pricing as well as start taking pre-orders for its flying car.', 'Like many automakers, XPeng has been affected by the global shortage of semiconductors that go into vehicles. The company said its deliveries of vehicles fell in August versus July. XPeng has three cars on the market — the flagship P7 sedan, a cheaper sedan called the P5 and the G3 sports utility vehicle.', 'The supply chain poses the “biggest challenge” for the company, but He sees it as a chance to build resilience at the automaker.', '“The pandemic has caused a shortage of semiconductor chips, which is the biggest blow to our business. I expect the chip shortage to ease in about 18 months from now. In the near future, the situation might get even worse,” he said.', '“XPeng is a very young company. I see this as an early test. If we can overcome the challenge and get ready for what’s to come, we will do even better when our sales reach 300,000 or 500,000 cars per year.”', 'Meanwhile, the company has pledged to push on with the release of new models. On Sept. 15, the company will officially launch its P5 sedan aimed at the mass market, after unveiling it in April. And from 2023, XPeng plans to launch at least two or three new vehicle models every year. In preparation for that, the electric carmaker is expanding its own manufacturing capacity.', 'The CEO said that in the future the company will launch more cars in the range of 200,000 yuan ($30,968) to 400,000 yuan. Currently, its cheapest car, the G3, starts at around 150,000 yuan. He also said that its models could include bigger 5-seat or 7-seat models. The company does not have a 7-seat model yet.', 'XPeng has tried to pitch itself as different from its domestic rivals because it develops its own in-house semi-autonomous driving features in a system called XPilot. Its latest version, XPilot 3.0, can be added into its cars as an optional extra and is a rival to Tesla’s Autopilot.', 'In the first quarter of the year, XPeng said that it recorded revenue from software for the first time, which includes its assisted driving system XPilot. The founder said that while the majority of XPeng’s revenue is from hardware now, software will be a “growing part” of that.', '“My idea is that after we launch XPilot 4.0, we will focus more on our software business,” He said, referring to the next-version of its limited self-driving feature suite.', '— CNBC’s Penny Chen contributed to this report', 'Correction: This article has been updated to accurately reflect which model is the cheapest one XPeng has on the market.']"

Thus far, electric vehicle introductions from Ford such as the Mustang Mach-E and upcoming Ford F-150 Lightning have been well-received by investors.', 'Ford Chair Bill Ford says the company plans to keep the momentum going into 2022 and beyond, despite an ongoing global shortage of semiconductor chips causing production disruptions.', '“When we came out with the Mustang Mach-E and then the F-150 Lightning, I think it really surprised a lot of people. Not just the fact that we came out with those vehicles but frankly how good they were,” he told CNBC. “I think you’re starting to see that in the investor base. Really, that’s the tip of the iceberg though.”', 'Ford, whose great-grandfather Henry Ford founded the automaker, sat down recently with CNBC to discuss the company’s stock rally, turnaround plan as well as special purpose acquisition companies and retail investors. Here are some highlights of that interview.', 'Ford said reinstating the company’s coveted dividend, which was cut in March 2020, is “quite prominent” on its to-do list, but he wouldn’t say when. Ford, chair since 1999, and other company executives have said it needs to be the right time, as the industry continues to work through the Covid-19 pandemic and a global shortage of semiconductor chips.', '“We’re looking at doing it as soon as we possibly can,” he said. “We have a very large portion of employee and retiree ownership, and they care deeply about the dividend as well.”', 'The quarterly dividend was last at 15 cents a share. It was suspended at the beginning of the pandemic to shore up the company’s cash as the pandemic caused rolling shutdowns of auto plants globally.', 'Ford’s crosstown rival, General Motors, hasn’t reinstated its dividend either. GM cut it in April 2020.', 'Ford said he doesn’t know if all of the company’s emerging initiatives under the Ford+ plan are reflected in its current stock price, but he said investors are beginning to take notice.', '“Clearly, I think investors understand that there’s true change under foot, and that Ford is going to be a major player in that change,” he said. Later adding, Ford’s underlying business is “very strong” and the rate of change is more than any other time in his more than 40 years with the automaker.', 'The company plans to shift focus to a more recurring revenue model under the plan, led by connected vehicle services and a focus on fleet customers, among other things. It’s something every automaker is attempting to do, as the industry invests billions in new technologies such as electric and autonomous vehicles.', 'The Ford family essentially controls the company through Class B preferred shares that give them 40% of shareholder voting rights. It’s a system that has been in place since the company went public in 1956, but one that not all investors believe should continue.', 'That system has faced numerous shareholder challenges. At this year’s shareholder meeting, 36.3% of voters supported a system that gave every share an equal vote, slightly higher than the 35.3% average since 2013.', 'Ford maintains support for the dual share structure, saying it has been a “very positive thing” for the company. He said it allows Ford to concentrate more on the long-term and not be another “nameless, faceless corporation.” He cited the family’s control in helping it avoid bankruptcy during the Great Recession, unlike GM and then-Chrysler, now known as Stellantis.', '“We’re not a nameless faceless corporation, and people know that there’s a family, and in my case an individual, who’s going to be there through thick and thin, won’t take a golden parachute and bail out, and cares deeply about the company,” he said.', 'Ford, 64, has no plans of stepping down from the company’s board for the foreseeable future, even as a younger generation of family members join the board. His daughter, Alexandra Ford English, and nephew, Henry Ford III, were both elected to the company’s board in May.', 'Ford, who joined the board in 1988, said the time was right for the two to become directors and learn the ropes. He said being on the board as a young executive with his father as well as his cousin, Edsel Ford II, who stepped down from the board earlier this year, provided a lot of value.', '“I wanted to provide the same kind of mentorship for them as they go forward and start to carry the torch for the Ford family,” he said.', 'Ford, a co-founder and partner of mobility capital venture firm Fontinalis Partners, said he’s not sure if SPACs are a flash in the pan or here to stay. “I guess time will tell, but clearly, it’s another avenue to liquidity that we didn’t have a short time ago.”', 'Ford said a lot of companies that Fontinalis is involved in are exploring SPAC deals, while others continue to pursue more traditional IPOs.', 'Fontinalis was founded in 2009. It is focused on emerging mobility companies. Investments have included Lyft, Postmates and lidar company Ouster. Ford said he co-founded the firm because he believed such mobility companies would play key roles in the future of transportation.', 'Whether Ford investors are institutional or retail, Ford said he wants them to be long-term owners of the stock.', '“What we really like is, at least, I’ll speak personally, are long term investors who want to be with us on the journey that we’re going on,” he said. “And if they’re retail investors or institutional mean, either way, that’s great.”']"

The report was also stunning in other ways. Payrolls were also revised higher by 709,000 jobs in November and December, and wages grew at a hot 5.7% year-over-year pace in January.', '“Everyone’s back to playing leap frog over each other to see how hawkish they can get about what the Fed’s going to do, when the Fed probably doesn’t even know itself,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.

You start looking at the CPI on a month over month basis ... there may be movement in the right direction,” said Hogan. He said headline inflation is expected to rise by 0.4%, down from 0.5% in December. But that would still be a hot 7.2% year-over-year reading.', '“Maybe movement in inflation in the right direction would be revelatory. I think it might take a bit out of some of the hawkish tone the street has,” he said.', 'Despite a sharp jump in bond yields, stocks ended Friday with gains for the week. Large swings punctuated trading in the past week, and some individual names were highly volatile. Meta Platforms fell more than 26% in one day on earnings disappointment, and PayPal also lost nearly 25% in a single session after issuing weak guidance. Amazon jumped 13.5% Friday after its earnings.', 'Julian Emanuel, senior managing director and leader of the equity, derivatives and quantitative strategy team at Evercore ISI, said that type of volatility in individual names highlights the risks for investors in the top tech growth stocks that are among the largest names in the S&P 500.', '“It’s extremely difficult for investors who have only known how to make money for 15 consecutive years by owning growth stocks to change how they view the world. The volatility we’ve seen around earnings in some of these names is not a surprise, but it’s exacerbated in an economy that is likely to grow north of 4%,” he said.', 'Emanuel expects cyclical and value stocks to perform better than growth names in an inflationary environment in which the central bank is raising interest rates.', 'The S&P 500 rose 1.5% in the past week, closing at 4,500, a key technical threshold. The Dow was up 1%, and the Nasdaq was up 2.4% for the week.

Stehn also noted that “while tighter financial conditions could, in principle, have notable effects on European growth, euro area financial conditions have not tightened meaningfully during past episodes of Russia-Ukraine tensions.”', '“A reason for the limited financial spillovers is that the Euro area has weak cross-border banking exposure to Russia and Ukraine,” he added.', 'However, the Wall Street giant believes that spillovers via the gas market are the most important possibility to watch.', '“While the effect of higher wholesale gas prices on consumers would likely be mitigated by limited wholesale-to-retail passthrough and government support schemes, we find that reduced gas supply could cause significant (although temporary) production disruptions across Europe,” Stehn said.', 'Russia is Europe’s largest gas provider, typically supplying 30-40% of the continent’s gas demand via its pipelines, but the euro area has recently begun shifting consumption away from Russian pipes toward liquified natural gas (LNG).

The Energy sector could provide relative shelter for investors wishing to hedge against this risk,” the strategists added.', 'However, in the base case scenario that the situation is resolved through diplomatic means, Oxford Economics expects markets to gradually calm down, Nord Stream 2 to get the green light, and asset prices to bounce back given Russia’s “strong fundamentals.”', 'In the event of a limited incursion, possibly in the form of air raids to destroy military infrastructure, the firm expects the U.S. to react with “biting” sanctions while the EU is consumed by internal divisions, and therefore deploys only mild sanctions such as a ban on electronic and semiconductor exports to Russia, or measures targeting Russian banks.', 'It would be this eventuality that sends the ruble to 83 against the dollar, at which point it could “easily be on a trajectory to 100, especially if there is a decisive breach,” the research note added.', 'In all three of these more moderate scenarios, the impact on stocks would likely be “relatively benign,” somewhat akin to the Crimean crisis in 2014, when Russian markets sold off in the short term, but a spillover to the euro zone was minimal and the bloc actually performed better than the global index for a six-month spell.']"
