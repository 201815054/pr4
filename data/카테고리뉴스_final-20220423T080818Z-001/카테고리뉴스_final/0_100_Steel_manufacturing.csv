1,"Lockdowns caused by China’s new Covid-19 outbreak are sparking concerns over steel, iron ore ",2021-01-20T00:36:44+0000,"['A new wave of Covid-19 cases in China’s Hebei province triggered transport restrictions in the major steel-producing region.', 'The lockdowns in Hebei include areas surrounding steel mills, limiting the ability to transport the metal to customers. China is the world’s top steel producer and analysts say Hebei contributes over 20% of the country’s total output.', 'Coronavirus cases in Hebei have been rising since the start of the year, prompting the province to lock down its capital, Shijiazhuang, and at least two other areas in an effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus.', 'The curbs are unlikely to affect steel production for now, but they could hurt demand by spurring the manufacturing sector to stop work earlier than planned ahead of the major Lunar New Year holiday, commodity data provider S&P Global Platts said earlier this month.', 'Demand and prices for raw materials used to make steel like iron ore could also shoot up, according to analysts.', 'Steel deliveries by truck have been suspended in Hebei, leaving rail as the only way to transport steel, Shanghai-based Chinese metal data provider Mysteel said in a note last week. The report said blocked roads have led to completed steel piling up at major mills in the region.', '“Partial lockdowns have restricted the transportation of goods, resulting in a sharper build in inventories held by local steel mills rather than at stockists in the first half of January,” said Atilla Widnell, co-founder of Singapore-based Navigate Commodities, in an email to CNBC on Monday.', '“We have heard anecdotal evidence that some stockists and traders are reluctant to tie up cash flow in-case a ‘soft lockdown’ is prolonged or intensified,” he added.', 'S&P Global Platts said inventories are rising at the Jingye Iron & Steel mill in Hebei’s capital city Shijiazhuang. The firm cited a source at the mill, which produces 13 million metric tons of crude steel a year.', 'Manufacturing and construction sites in China are set to stop work earlier than usual ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday between Feb. 11 and 17. That’s likely to hit demand for steel, which is heavily used in those sectors.', 'The government advised manufacturing and construction workers to return home before the peak holiday travel period, said S&P Global Platts.', '“According to market sources, Beijing has done this in (an) effort to reduce the possibility of a spike in COVID-19 cases during and after the Lunar New Year holidays,” the firm wrote.', 'Work stopping earlier suggests steel demand is set to drop, causing inventories to rise elsewhere.', '“Some traders said they were unwilling to increase their steel inventories as they anticipate having to hold on to these for much longer than usual, and with steel prices continuing to soar, building inventories will put pressure on their cash flows,” S&P Global Platts added.', 'Daniel Hynes, senior commodity strategist at Australian bank ANZ, told CNBC on Monday that risks could spread to iron ore.', '“There are concerns that a further rise in coronavirus cases in Hebei could result in some steel making regions being locked down. This would obviously impact demand for iron ore, as steel mills would likely see supply chains disrupted, thus impacting steel production,” he said in an email.', 'The ripple effects can already be seen in the costs for raw materials used to process steel like coking coal, said energy research consultancy Wood Mackenzie.', 'Coking coal prices are surging and are about 450 yuan per ton higher than last year, according to Zhilu Wang, research associate at the firm.', '“This is due to the restrictions on inter-provincial transportation in Hebei provinces which has resulted in the increase of transportation fee,” said Wang.', 'While this could in turn support steel prices, Wang predicted it could mildly weaken overall as traders stock less of the commodity due to the Covid uncertainty.']"
2,‘World’s first fossil-free steel’ produced in Sweden and delivered to Volvo,2021-08-19T15:07:19+0000,"['Sweden’s SSAB says it has “produced the world’s first fossil-free steel” and has started delivering it to the Volvo Group, its first customer.', 'The news represents the latest development for the Hybrit project, which was set up in 2016 and is owned by SSAB, energy firm Vattenfall and LKAB, a mining and minerals group. Both Vattenfall and LKAB are owned by the Swedish state. The idea underpinning Hybrit is to use “100% fossil-free hydrogen” rather than coal and coke in steel production.', 'In an announcement on Wednesday, SSAB called the trial delivery “an important step on the way to a completely fossil-free value chain for iron- and steelmaking.”', 'Looking ahead, the goal is to develop the technology so it can be demonstrated at an industrial scale. It’s hoped this could happen as early as 2026.', '“The first fossil-free steel in the world is not only a breakthrough for SSAB, it represents proof that it’s possible to make the transition and significantly reduce the global carbon footprint of the steel industry,” Martin Lindqvist, SSAB’s president and CEO, said.', 'Steel production is one of many industrial processes ripe for improvement when it comes to emissions and other metrics related to sustainability. The challenge is a big one, however.', 'According to the International Energy Agency, the iron and steel sector is responsible for 2.6 gigatonnes of direct carbon dioxide emissions each year. In 2019, this figure was greater than the direct emissions from sectors such as cement and chemicals.', 'The IEA adds that the steel sector is “the largest industrial consumer of coal, which provides around 75% of its energy demand.”', 'Hybrit is not the only project looking to mitigate the effects of steel production. Another, H2 Green Steel, plans to build a steel production facility in the north of Sweden that will be powered by a “green” hydrogen plant.', 'Back in February the Swedish firm, which is backed by investors including Spotify founder Daniel Ek, said production would start in 2024 and be based in the country’s Norrbotten region. By 2030, the aim is for the business to have the capacity to produce 5 million tons of steel per year.', 'Hydrogen can be produced in a number of ways. One method includes using electrolysis, with an electric current splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen.', 'If the electricity used in the process comes from a renewable source such as wind or solar then it’s termed “green” or “renewable” hydrogen.', 'As well as steel production, aluminum manufacturing is another sector where renewables could have a role to play.', 'Earlier this year German automaker BMW said it had started to source and use aluminum produced using solar energy.']"
3,US Steel CEO says it is ‘totally realistic’ to bring manufacturing jobs back,2017-02-23T20:11:50+0000,"['Mark Cuban  made comments recently about how robotics and automation are the wave of the future and could cause unemployment in America. ', 'Many believe most of the unemployment Cuban referred to would primarily affect traditional manufacturing jobs and industries. However, U.S. Steel CEO Mario Longhi said he believes it’s realistic and necessary for manufacturing jobs to come back.', '“It is totally realistic to bring jobs back,” Longhi told CNBC’s “Fast Money Halftime Report” on Thursday. “If you look at the regulatory system that we have today, it takes us years sometimes to get some approvals. We have a pipeline of projects just sitting out there to be executed on. In a fair playing field, for every great idea or innovative solution that comes to place, you need a physical device to bring it to fruition so the full value can be captured. It is totally viable, it is needed and can be done.”', 'Among those projects Longhi may be referencing could be the Dakota Access and Keystone projects that President Trump said earlier must use pipes made from U.S. steel. Longhi reiterated comments he made earlier to CNBC that U.S. Steel is fully capable of producing for upcoming pipeline projects.', '“The capability is in there for us to make everything that is needed,” Longhi said. “We are going to become energy dependent not too far down the road. Therefore, the capacity to explore, produce, extract and transmit is something that our industry is capable of delivering.”', 'The CEO was also one of 24 business leaders who met with President Trump on Thursday to discuss economic policies and the job growth agenda. ', 'In response to comments made about automation and robots taking over manufacturing jobs, Longhi said he believes labor is still necessary to fulfill the 3 percent growth Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin mentioned earlier to CNBC. ', '“If you add a good dimension of our economic growth, 3 plus percent a year, that is going to require a significant amount of labor as we go into the new industries,” Longhi said. “If we talk about robots, robots have to be made somewhere. So I think evolution is key, and I believe economic growth will create conditions for many, many new jobs to be created.”', 'And while Longhi stopped short in suggesting whether or not he was in favor of a border-adjustment tax, he did voice a need for a “fair playing field” in international trade. ', '“My view is that what we need is a fair playing field. I don’t consider a trade war when you are going trying to make sure that everybody plays by the same rules,” Longhi said. “In many cases, what happens is that we compete against countries that are unfairly twisting what should be a market-force driven environment into their own benefit, and we don’t have a chance to compete in that regard.”']"
4,"Next to the last steel mill in town, a robotic farm grows backed by Pritzker billions",2022-03-05T14:43:09+0000,"['Next to the last steel mill in the poor industrial town of Braddock along the Monongahela River just nine miles from Pittsburgh’s U.S. Steel Tower, a vertical farming business backed by billionaire Nicholas Pritzker’s Tao Capital is sprouting as an agritech innovator.The start-up, founded in 2016 as RoBotany by MBA student Austin Webb and incubated at Carnegie Mellon University, is aiming to disrupt the $60 billion U.S. produce market. Now named the more consumer-friendly sounding Fifth Season, the emerging business is leveraging advanced technology, $75 million in venture capital, increased distribution, a planned new Columbus, Ohio, facility, and an expanded management team to score in the fast-growth vertical farming market. CEO Webb confidently projects Fifth Season could be a $15 million business in Pittsburgh within five years and $500 million through geographic expansion plans, and estimates sales will hit a double-digit revenue rate this year and a 600% revenue increase.   “Our smart manufacturing facility improves the yield, taste and texture of the vegetables, and does that with 95% less water, 95% less land, and uses no pesticides or chemicals,” said Webb, who is 33. Fifth Season’s automated proprietary system grows fresh produce year-round indoors in vertical trays, relying on artificial intelligence, robotics and data to control light, water and nutrients, and harvest leafy greens.', 'Currently less than 1% of fresh produce is grown through hydroponics systems versus open-field agriculture, but this segment is forecast by Mordor Intelligence to grow by nearly 11% yearly to about $600 million by 2025. “There’s tremendous runway as the price comes down and more reliable operations remove the risk,” said Brian Holland, managing director of Cowen & Co. in New York.  “It’s a race to scale with potentially multiple winners who can prove the economic model for automatic, robotic growing,” he added. “Fifth Season is more advanced, if not the most advanced, in the market in marrying technology and robotics to grow vegetables indoors at a lower cost.”', 'Fifth Season is competing in a capital intensive, highly fragmented market with more than 2,000, mostly smaller farms and a handful of larger scale players. Among the largest is San Francisco-based Plenty Unlimited, which recently inked $400 million in strategic funding from Walmart and plans to sell its fresh produce from its Compton facility at the retailer’s California stores. Another major rival is AeroFarms in Newark, New Jersey, which scrapped a SPAC deal to go public in October 2021 and is continuing to build out capacity at a Danville, Virginia farm.  “Market leadership is just a function of time and a function of capital,” said Webb.', 'Racing to build out its business and keep pace with competitors, Fifth Season plans to construct its second indoor growing farm in 2023, and is negotiating for a land parcel in Columbus, Ohio, near the John Glenn Airport. Through a partnership with hummus maker Sabra in December 2021, the company also has introduced a new product line of co-branded, grab ’n go salad kits, priced at $6 to $8. Distribution of its products are being expanded this March at more Giant Eagle outlets as well as Kroger and ShopRite across 10 states and 1,000 locations, with a goal of reaching 3,000 grocery stores in 2023. In its initial year of commercial operation in 2020, some 500,000 pounds of its produce were supplied to nearby restaurants and campus dining locations from its 60,000-square foot growing space on a half-acre of land.', 'Fifth Season’s growth spurt signals a new high-tech era for the former steel-making capital. Dozens of regional tech start-ups are emerging in Pittsburgh and throughout the former Rust Belt as blue-collar factory work transitions to technical jobs and older, industrial towns are rebooted.', '“The tech multiplier doesn’t lift all boats but it is spreading in the heartland,” said Congressman Ro Khanna of Silicon Valley, author of “Dignity In A Digital Age.”', '“The factory workers and technicians know how to make things and have an extraordinary work ethnic and sense of community. They are defying past conventions,” he said.', 'Gearing up, Fifth Season expanded its leadership team in January, while employee count is expected to increase to 100 next year from 80 now.  Finance and tech veteran Brian Griffiths came on board as CFO from semiconductor company Skorpios Technologies with experience at Credit Suisse and Guggenheim Partners. Varun Khanna was hired as vice president of food products from leadership posts at Chobani and Sabra. Glenn Wells joined as senior vice present of sales and previously worked at Quaker Oats, Welch’s and Dole.   ', 'Another prong in its growth strategy is a planned $70 million expenditure on a new Columbus vertical farm that is three times larger than the $27 million Braddock plant, including real estate development for land, a building and equipment. The company’s highly automated farms only require 35 to 50 production workers. The Pittsburgh plant makes four million salad meals annually, while the larger central Ohio location is expected to produce 15 million. Fifth Season is working with economic development groups One Columbus and Jobs Ohio on the new location.', 'The foundation for Fifth Season’s game-changing business comes from the intellectual power at Carnegie Mellon University and Pittsburgh’s tech entrepreneurial cluster in computer science, robotics and engineering. Webb developed a prototype in his last year of the MBA program and launched the business upon graduation with co-founder Austin Lawrence, an environmental scientist and mechanical engineer he met on campus.  ', 'A third co-founder, Webb’s brother Brac, is CTO. He designed the production software. The system was stress-tested for two years in a converted steel mill on the south side of Pittsburgh before the Braddock farm started operations in 2020.    ', 'Webb was mentored by Dave Mawhinney, executive director of CMU’s Schwartz Center for Entrepreneurship, who helped him connect with investors and role models such as serial entrepreneur Luis von Ahn, the Pittsburgh-based founder of Nasdaq-listed edtech company Duolingo.  He also introduced MBA student, Grant Vandenbussche, a former General Mills global strategy coordinator, who joined the team in 2018 as a business development manager and is now chief category officer. “Fifth Season is a testament to CMU’s ability to attract very talented young people and grow entrepreneurs through its MBA program,” said Mawhinney. “It’s all about the network.”', 'Even before graduating in 2017, Webb lined up capital from angel investors, most of them connected to CMU. The network effect also played out as Mawhinney introduced Webb to the Columbus-based VC firm Drive Capital, which seeded the start-up with $1 million in 2017 and led a $35 million round in 2019 as it came out of stealth mode, changed its name from RoBotany, and Drive partner Chris Olsen joined as a board member.', '“Chris has pushed us to be thoughtful about the market and to think bigger nationally, not just locally or regionally, and to build a long-lasting company and a new product line,” said Vandenbussche.', 'The $75 million it has raised to date from investors includes not only Pritzker’s Tao Capital Partners in San Francisco but eight different investor groups that joined in during 2021.', '“Pittsburgh is coming together as an ecosystem. One of the reasons it’s doubling down is because of its strengths in AI, machine learning and legacy with biosciences,” said Kit Mueller, who heads community networking group RustBuilt and recently became vice president of crypto asset company Stronghold Digital Mining in Pittsburgh. No longer dependent on steel, iron, and its rivers as competitive advantages, the city is transitioning from gritty industries and robotics start-ups are crowding into the so-called Silicon Strip of former warehouses. This mid-sized city of 303,000, less than half its peak population of 677,000 in 1950, has emerged as a technology testbed for self-driving technology from Ford-invested Argo AI and Amazon-backed Aurora, and Uber’s technology unit acquired by Aurora. It’s also an anchor for R&D labs at Facebook, Apple, Google, Zoom, and Intel.  ', 'A lingering issue facing Midwestern start-ups is a shortage of venture capital. California, New York and Boston logged about two-thirds of $329.9 billion in start-up investments in 2021. This imbalance is beginning to shift toward specialized inland hubs as strongholds take shape such as Pittsburgh with robotics as well as Cleveland with biotech and Indianapolis with SaaS.', 'Improved lifestyle amenities, increased opportunities and the lower costs of living are draws for millennial tech talent to inland hubs. The co-founders of Fifth Season, and many others, came to Pittsburgh to pursue entrepreneurship and have stayed. ', '“The only ones who don’t like Pittsburgh are those who never came here and those who left but never came back,” said Lynsie Campbell, a serial founder who bounced around New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco but returned home as a Pittsburgh-based partner with The Fund Midwest, and is a leader in city’s venture capital and start-up sphere.', 'To learn more and to sign up for CNBC’s Small Business Playbook event, click here.']"

Given Ukraine produces over half of the world’s neon, the figure could fall below 270 metric tons in 2022 if the nation’s neon producers remain shut.', '“Of the materials used in chip-making that could see a hit to their supply from the Ukraine conflict, it is neon that poses the greatest potential challenge,” Hanbury told CNBC via email.', 'The ongoing global chip shortage has already wreaked havoc on supply chains and led to lengthy delays for products such as new cars and games consoles like the PlayStation 5.', 'A potential global neon shortage now threatens to make matters even worse.', 'Neon is a byproduct of large-scale steel production.', 'It gets produced following the fractional distillation (a chemical separation process) of liquid air, which is the air that has been cooled to very low temperatures.', '“Historically, up to 90% of the neon for the chip industry was produced as a by-product of Russian steel manufacturing and later refined by companies mainly based in Ukraine,” Hanbury said, pointing to firms like Cryoin, Ingas and UMG RT.', 'Alan Priestley, an analyst at Gartner, told CNBC that most major chip manufacturers have several months of neon in reserve, adding that it’s not a major issue for them yet.', 'Intel said it is monitoring the situation closely. “Intel has assessed the possible impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on its supply chain,” a spokesperson told CNBC.', 'The person added: “Intel’s strategy of having a diverse, global supply chain minimizes its risk from potential local interruptions. We continue to monitor the situation carefully.”', 'TSMC declined to comment and Samsung did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.', '“Some smaller fabs with limited supply may be affected earlier,” Priestley said. Chip manufacturers are working with their supply chains to try to minimize the impacts, he added. A fab is a chip factory, where semiconductors are “fabricated.”', 'The global semiconductor industry has been preparing for an event like this for years.', 'It took crucial steps to try to limit future risks associated with neon supplies in the wake of Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.', '“Following the Crimean annexation, the chip sector acted to cut the need for use of neon in the manufacturing process,” Hanbury said. “At the same time, steps were taken to increase stocks of the gas at two points in the supply chain, so both gas suppliers and semiconductor makers each typically now have three to 12 months supply at hand.”', 'New suppliers outside of Ukraine and Russia were also put in place by semiconductor manufacturers, Hanbury added.', '“We estimate only about two-fifths of the neon used in global semiconductor production today is sourced from Russia and Ukraine,” Hanbury added.', 'Dutch firm ASML, which makes the highly complex lithography machines used by the chip giants, reduced its reliance on neon sourced from Ukraine to approximately 20% of previous levels, Hanbury added.', 'A spokesperson for ASML told CNBC, “ASML recognizes the importance of being prepared in order to manage unplanned events including conflicts when they could impact our supply chain.”', 'They added: “We continue to closely monitor the status of the conflict and are currently investigating together with our suppliers what the impact (if any) would be and to what extent our suppliers can use alternative sources if necessary.”']"

Manufacturing is the bedrock of any strong economy.”', 'Ferriola said that because foreign competitors are motivated not by profits, but by employment, those countries are effectively trying to “export their unemployment” to the United States steel industry, hurting companies doing business stateside.', 'Moreover, if those competitors’ low-cost imports continue to pressure U.S. steel producers that supply materials for everything from tractors to appliances, Ferriola said they would eventually engulf the whole U.S. market.', '“There’s no doubt, when you have predatory countries like China, as an example, they will take care of their own appliance [and] tractor industries in China before they worry about supplying steel to those American manufacturers here,” the CEO said. “Steel is a raw material that’s essential for all manufacturing. You want to make sure you have a strong steel industry to have a strong manufacturing industry.”', 'Despite these calls from high-profile steel CEOs like Ferriola, President Donald Trump has not yet been able to push through policy putting tariffs on steel imports.', 'However, if the policy were passed, Ferriola said that Nucor and its peers would be able to unleash a whole new wave of improvements meant to boost business, which was slightly weak for Nucor, according to its second-quarter earnings report.', '“If you look at the last six, seven years, we’ve invested over $7 billion growing our company, and we’re doing that in an environment where we’re not sure we have a sustainable industry,” Ferriola told Cramer. “Can you imagine the action that Nucor would take and others in our industry would take in growing our business, creating jobs, if we were assured of a sustainable environment in which we could operate our industry?”', 'Disclosure: Cramer’s charitable trust owns shares in Nucor.']"

It’s killing you,” Trump told a crowd in the historic steel town of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, while on the campaign trail in 2016.', 'Much of the president’s electoral support came on the back of his protectionist pledge to cut out foreign competition, even though it stands in stark opposition to his Republican party’s traditional free trade orthodoxy.', '“The economic case for steel and aluminum tariffs or other import restrictions is weak,” the free trade advocates’ missive said. It argued that the proposed tariffs — at least 24 percent on all steel imports and 7.7 percent on all aluminum imports globally, or larger tariffs of 53 percent on steel and 26.3 percent on aluminum against select countries including China, Brazil, India, South Korea and Russia — “would hurt downstream domestic manufacturers” by raising their costs, as well as trigger a “tit-for-tat game of foreign retaliation.”', 'The organizations cited 2015 census data showing that steel mills employed roughly 140,000 Americans and added $36 billion to the economy, while “steel-consuming industries, including manufacturers who rely on steel imports, employ 6.5 million Americans and add about $1 trillion to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).”', '“Raising costs on manufacturers will jeopardize far more jobs than could possibly be saved by imposing steel tariffs or other restrictions,” the letter said.', 'Steel industry leaders, on the other hand, are staunchly behind the proposed measure. In early February,  executives from the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) wrote a letter calling on Trump to forge ahead with Section 232 recommendations to “stop the relentless inflow of foreign steel.”', 'The U.S. is the world’s biggest steel importer, while China produces half the world’s supply of it.

Still, although China is a frequent target of Trump’s trade ire, the U.S. actually imports most of its steel from Canada at 16 percent, followed by Brazil, South Korea, Mexico and Russia. China doesn’t even crack the top five.', 'China warned last week that it would “take action” if the U.S.′ decision affected its interests, while European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that the EU would enact similar measures in retaliation. Trump has until April to act on the recommendations.', 'Meanwhile,  some of the president’s “America first” vows have gone quiet, particularly one that would have required U.S. pipeline producers to buy American-made steel.

The rest of the company, which manufactures special bar quality steel in five U.S. locations, is fully automated. Timken — the chief executive officer, president and chairman — said his company will make efforts to grow its business with the excess funds made from the tariffs.', '“Even though there is a high level of automation [at present], it’s important to recognize that you have to lean out your entire organization, you have to be as organized as possible, in order to compete in a global market that is awash with excess capacity,” Timken told CNBC on “Power Lunch” on Monday.', 'That overcapacity includes China, which has been flooding the global market with a steel production 10 times that of the U.S.  ', 'Timken said the tariffs — 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum — will help correct the overcapacity issues. ', '“We spend a lot of time talking about China and their 400 [million] tons,” Timken said. “But you also have to recognize there are another 300 [million] tons in the rest of the world that are targeting a market that is only 94 million tons.” (Editor’s note: After this article was published, Tim Timken contacted CNBC to say he had misstated the numbers of tons during the interview. The numbers in this quote have been corrected.)', 'While increased prices from tariffs could lead to companies using different products, or buying ready-made products directly, Timken said he’s not too concerned.', '“We know that if we’re given a level playing field, we can go toe-to-toe with anybody in the world,” he said. “What I can’t do is compete with foreign governments. That is what we’ve been doing over the last couple of years.”', 'Over time, the tariffs are a growth strategy for the U.S. economy, said Alan Tonelson, founder of the economic blog RealityChek.', '“There is no free market in China, and China sets the global price,” Tonelson told CNBC on “Closing Bell.”', '“Unless you think that the United States can keep on, can grow healthfully at all, with a steadily increasing presence of China government subsidized products in its own market,” Tonelson said. “If you value free markets … that’s the last thing you should want to see. And it can’t possibly make for healthy growth over the long term.”', 'But, Steve Fisher, chief executive officer and president of Novelis, an Atlanta-based industrial aluminum company, said it’s a bad idea to impose a blanket tariff over all countries.', '“A tariff that is arbitrarily put on all countries, instead of targeting where the issue is — the ... subsidized overcapacity in China — is not really effective,” he told CNBC on “Power Lunch.” “It disproportionately affects our good supply chain, ... other countries that are actually acting in a rational manner.”', 'The United States is the world’s biggest importer of steel, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.

Its stock market is down about 5 percent year-to-date and was flat over the last 12 months.', 'On Monday, Trump tweeted that his hasty announcement may not be implemented for Canada and Mexico if a fair NAFTA agreement is negotiated. Canadian market watchers are hoping this will be the case. ', 'After  aerospace-related trade flare-ups, fights over  softwood lumber and President Donald Trump’s continuous  verbal jabs at the country, the last thing Canada needs now is to get into another cross-border brawl.', '“Canada seems to get kicked when they’re down,” said Barry Schwartz, vice president and chief investment officer at Baskin Financial Services, a Toronto-based wealth management firm. “We’re dealing with so many things at the same time, and Canada hasn’t even done anything wrong.”', 'Imports on tariffs could hit the country particularly hard. Canada exports nearly 90 percent of its steel to the United States, while it accounts for 16 percent of all U.S. steel imports, the most out of any country. It also accounts for 41 percent of America’s aluminum imports. Trump’s main target in this, China, barely exports any steel to the United States, with America ranking 26th as a destination for Chinese steel imports, according to the International Trade Administration.', 'While there aren’t publicly listed steel and aluminum companies in Canada of any significance anymore — they were all bought in the mid-2000s by larger international concerns when demand for commodities from China was soaring — putting a 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum should make goods in other sectors, such as auto, defense and aerospace, more expensive to produce and pricier to buy. If that happens, then people and companies may spend less in other areas, which could then impact a number of sectors.', '“Resources will be shifted toward these two sectors and away from everything else,” said John Curtis, a senior fellow at the C.D. Howe Institute and the founding chief economist at what used to be Canada’s Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. “That means people will have to pay more, so they’ll buy less of everything else in the economy.”', 'Where a steel tariff might have the most impact, though, is on Canada and America’s interconnected supply chain, of which many companies big and small are a part of, Curtis said. For instance, cars assembled in Canada have parts made in the United States and vice versa. Cars are often being shipped back and forth between the two countries until final assembly.', '“Parts move back and forth until it might finally get made in Canada,” said Patrick Leblond, a senior fellow the Ottawa’s Centre For International Governance Innovation. “Then that car will get exported back to the U.S. Is there going to be tax every time that happens?”', 'Steel and aluminum tariffs should be worrisome for companies and investors alike, but the big question that everyone has on their minds now is, what does this mean for NAFTA?', 'That question likely won’t be answered anytime soon. In a tweet Monday morning, Trump called out Canada: “We have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada. NAFTA, which is under renegotiation right now, has been a bad deal for U.S.A. Massive relocation of companies & jobs. Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new & fair NAFTA agreement is signed. Also, Canada must treat our farmers much better.”', 'Threatening to remove tariffs only if the administration gets what it thinks is a good deal from NAFTA surely won’t go over well with Canada and Mexico. (And the United States has a trade surplus with Canada, not a deficit, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative.)', 'Still, Leblond doesn’t think these tariffs will impact discussions, as negotiators likely are focused more on technical and legal issues right now than steel. Also, when the U.S. slapped a 20.8 percent tariff on Canadian lumber producers for softwood lumber imports, NAFTA talks kept going. (Canada did take its fight with the United States to the World Trade Organization, though.)', 'However, it certainly doesn’t help things, Curtis said, and could make negotiations much more awkward and tense. Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland, who is part of the negotiating team, said sternly that these tariffs were “absolutely unacceptable” and that Canada is prepared to “take responsive measures to defend its trade interests and workers.”', 'Prime Minister Justin Trudeau echoed Freeland’s comments, adding that “any disruption to this integrated market would be significant and serious.”', 'Some market analysts do foresee a grave threat to NAFTA in Trump’s tariff move. But if Canada and other countries do indeed retaliate with tariffs of their own and a trade war begins in earnest, then whether NAFTA stays or goes could ultimately be of lesser importance. It could upend global trade as we know it, Leblond said. He’s particularly concerned about Trump using a national security excuse to impose tariffs.', 'Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said it’s a double-edged sword in terms of the NAFTA negotiations. Unless Canada gains an exemption, a war of words and actions on trade isn’t a helpful backdrop for reasoned negotiations. But it also helps satisfy Trump’s protectionist voting bloc, perhaps easing the pressure on the White House to take a hard line on the NAFTA deal.', 'These sorts of disputes underscore why Canada believes that the appeal process under NAFTA is a critical piece of the puzzle. The Trump administration wants a deal that excludes that provision, but without it Canada can face spurious rulings against its exports even with a “free trade” agreement in force, Shenfeld said. “The latest claim, that U.S. national security is imperiled by the use of Canadian steel or aluminum in U.S. manufacturing, seems baseless, considering that Canada has been America’s steadfast ally,” he said.', '“If everyone can now say we’re going to impose tariffs because we need to protect what’s important and use national security as a justification, then everyone will lose,” Leblond said. ”[Canada] could put a ban on California wine; China could impose constraints on intellectual property rights or innovation. The fear is that it will undermine the WTO process, and for what? To protect a small portion of U.S. manufacturing jobs?”', 'While things could change between now and April 11, when Trump will decide whether to impose the steel tariff, and April 19, when he must make a decision on aluminum tariffs, stocks have taken a hit from the announcement.', 'The S&P/TSX Composite Index representing Canadian stocks hasn’t been hit as hard as the S&P 500 — the market is almost flat now since the announcement — but some companies have seen their share prices decline more significantly. Global auto parts supplier Magna, for example, is down 3.9 percent and shares of aerospace giant Bombardier fell by nearly 6 percent when the markets opened Friday but have regained some ground since.', 'More from Global Investing Hot Spots:  If Trump thinks he’s taking a trade war to China, he’s not', 'Italy’s far right is a big fan of Trump’s tariffs  Risky retirement investors reaching for income in foreign bonds', 'Jeff Mills, managing director and co-chief investment strategist at Pittsburgh-based PNC Asset Management Group, isn’t surprised that stocks in the United States and elsewhere are selling off post-announcement, though U.S. stock did rebound on Friday afternoon.', '“The policy change will very likely increase costs for all consumers, which means it will serve to reduce some of the benefit of the recently passed tax bill,” he said. “Markets are now worried about countermeasures from other countries, and investors are starting to wonder what other protectionist measures Trump could take.”', 'Baskin Financial’s Schwartz doesn’t think the Canadian stock market will take that much of a hit over these tariffs specially — the S&P/TSX is already underperforming other markets – but if a trade war heats up then stocks in Canada and around the globe will see big declines.', '“Who knows what will happen, but I presume the direction would be negative,” he said. “The price of goods for everything around the world would go up, inflation would rise, and while companies ultimately adjust to inflation, stocks will be negative while that adjustment period happens.”', 'Global investors can’t do much now, added Mills, as the exact details are still largely unknown, though he does think, generally, people should be making sure they’re comfortable with the risk they’re taking in their portfolios. Any investors interested in Canada, though, should hope that Trump, at the very least, makes the country tariff-exempt.', '“Canada is probably the most penalized as things stand today,” Mills said. “Perhaps cooler heads prevail over the weekend and the tariffs end up being less broad-based.”', '— By Bryan Borzykowski, special to CNBC.com']"

They’re both up slightly for 2017, while U.S. Steel and AK Steel have been put through the meat grinder, down 35 and 43 percent, respectively,” Cramer said.', 'Watch the full segment here:', 'The divide between these steel players starts with manufacturing. AK Steel and U.S. Steel do so traditionally, buying iron ore and coal and smelting it into steel.', 'Nucor and Steel Dynamics use mini-mills instead, melting scrap steel with electric furnaces and tinkering with the carbon content.

The whole group was crushed by the 2008 financial crisis, then again in the second half of 2014.', '“The culprit? Two things: one, all the emerging market economies that had been such voracious buyers of steel started to slow down, and two, in order to combat its own slowdown, the Chinese government started subsidizing steel production. China then dumped their excess steel all over the world at depressed prices, including right here in the United States,” Cramer explained.', 'Then, when former President Barack Obama placed tariffs on steel imports from seven countries including China in 2016, the steel stocks started to rally.', 'However, now that those tariffs have been baked into the stocks and the tariffs are old news, the game becomes based on merit, Cramer said.', 'While AK Steel’s quarter wasn’t as bad as U.S. Steel’s huge miss, bearish guidance from its management team still drove the stock down 10 percent.', 'Nucor’s earnings report, on the other hand, showed sales up 30 percent over year, and management forecast an improvement in business in the second quarter.', 'The stock rallied 5 percent, though Cramer admitted that could have been because President Donald Trump announced he would take further steps to protect steel producers from foreign competition.', '“Of course, the White House hasn’t decided to do anything yet other than investigate the issue, but some broader based tariffs, if we get them, could give the industry a real boost,” he added.', 'Steel Dynamics delivered a big earnings beat, with sales much higher than anticipated showing 36 percent growth year over year. Its stock climbed 7 percent on the news.', 'So with U.S. Steel the worst of the four by far, with AK Steel only slightly better, which steelmaker wins between Nucor and Steel Dynamics?', '“In the end, I’m going to go with Nucor — it’s a higher quality company, better management, slightly faster earnings growth, low cost, and a more consistent track record, which is why I’ve been telling members of the ActionAlertsPlus.com club that they should be buying it, as we’ve been doing for my charitable trust. Steel Dynamics — very close second,” Cramer said.', 'When it comes to their stocks, however, you get what you pay for. Cramer suggested paying up for Nucor, which trades at 13 times next year’s earnings estimates, because it has the best dividend of the four, offering shareholders a 2.5 percent yield.', '“And I bet that if business stays as strong as it is right now, they could declare a special dividend.

', 'His  perspective comes not just from living in the city for all of his  52 years but also as a supplier of precision plastic components  to the region’s bedrock auto industry for nearly 30 years.', '  Over that period, Phillips has been part of the industry’s  remarkable evolution, from robust to ruin, bailout to revival.  Once the center of the automotive universe, Detroit had been  doubly battered in recent years, first by offshoring tens of  thousands of manufacturing jobs and the shuttering of hundreds of  factories, then by the Great Recession and the housing crisis, which led to massive foreclosures and blighted neighborhoods. By  the time the city was forced to declare bankruptcy two years ago,  Detroit was $18 billion in debt and its population was the lowest  since the 1910 census.', '  Detroit emerged from bankruptcy last year, and a resurgence in  manufacturing—while never to reach heyday heights—is  seen as a major pathway to continued recovery. The federal  bailout of GM  and Chrysler helped bring the auto industry  back from the brink, and today the Big Three U.S. automakers,  including Ford and the foreign competitors that have built  American factories, are thriving. This is good news for the  supply chain producers, too, such as Prism Plastics.', '  Prism represents the so-called next-generation  manufacturers—characterized by leading-edge technology,  innovation and entrepreneurship—that are reconfiguring  Detroit’s legacy as a place that makes stuff. “This is a great  place to be,” Phillips said, “because a lot of people have that  mentality. It helps the whole culture of change, growth and new  thinking.”', '  A confluence of factors—including public and private  initiatives, high-tech incubators, philanthropic fundraising, an  influx of venture capital and a craftsmanship movement—are  bringing Detroit back from the depths of municipal bankruptcy and  widespread unemployment, which stands at 7.8 percent in metro  Detroit, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.', '  The auto industry still reigns in the Motor City. The U.S. auto  industry as a whole, the Detroit Free Press reported in February,  now employs more workers than it has at any time since March  2008.

', '  Then the Great Recession hit, devastating the city and its  manufacturing core. Hundreds of companies went out of business, and tens of thousands of workers lost their jobs. Even so,  Prism—already a lean debt-free operation—“was  positioned where we needed to be,” Phillips said, and actually  prospered as competitors went under, survivors consolidated “and  work came to us.” Revenues jumped from $9 million in 2010 to $30  million last year and should top $35 million in 2015.', '  Prism had added an injection-molding facility in Harlingen, Texas,  in 2005 and opened the Chesterfield plant in 2012. In May the  company announced it was investing $2.5 million to add 10,000 square feet of space to the 26,000-square-foot factory to house four new  Toshiba Electric molding presses. “We run 24/7 with three people  per shift,” Phillips reported. Although the global automotive  sector comprises 99 percent of sales, he added, Prism is entering  the medical arena via an acquisition within the year.', 'Read MoreIconic brands still made in the USA', '  The fact that Prism can churn out a half-billion plastic parts a  year with automated machines operated by just three employees per  shift speaks volumes about the new age of manufacturing—and  that the millions of jobs lost over the past 20 years, whether to  offshoring or attrition, aren’t coming back. But automation  doesn’t necessarily equate to unemployment, either, as many  critics charge.', '  Yes, robots are taking over many human tasks, but humans have to  build the robots. That reality led Zurich-based ABB Robotics to  begin production in May at a new factory in the Detroit suburb of  Auburn Hills to better serve its $7.5 billion U.S. market. “The  expansion is consistent with our global strategy of getting  closer to our North American customers,” said Keith Fox, vice president of robots and applications, who heretofore have been supplied by  ABB’s facilities in Sweden and China. “We’ll reduce delivery  schedules in the U.S. from 20 to 25 weeks to six to 10 weeks.”', '  The Auburn Hills plant currently employs about 500 people, with  plans to double that number by 2020, Fox said. Sixty percent of  sales are to the automotive sector, a drop from 80 percent in the  1990s. “Other industries are growing faster,” he said, notably  aerospace, pharmaceuticals and packaging.', '  Industrial robots have been employed in Detroit’s auto plants for  years; newer applications include machine tending and materials  handling in various industries.

The researchers teamed up with entrepreneurship grads John  Hennessy and Dan Vander Ley, both of whom are engineers as well.  Together they developed a nanofiber Kevlar material for  lithium-ion batteries that separates the positive and negative  electrodes inside. It replaces polyethylene, which has been known  to melt and spark fires when the electrodes touch. Such incidents  plagued batteries in Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner and Dell laptops.', '  Elegus’ patent-pending nanofiber separator can be applied to  every type of lithium-ion battery, including those in Detroit  automaker’s electric and hybrid vehicles, said Vander Ley, the  company’s CIO and CMO. “Lithium ion is projected to be a  $72 billion market by 2020,” he said, with $4 billion for  separators alone. “Our separators are also applicable to  lithium-sulfur batteries, an emerging technology about five years  out.”', '  Elegus, nonetheless, has yet to make any products or secure any  customers. The principles have been busy raising private funds  and fielding dozens of sample requests from automotive, chemical  and battery makers. The company got a huge boost in early June  when Techstars—a Boulder-based accelerator network that  provides seed money and mentoring for high-tech start-ups in  exchange for 7 percent to 10 percent of equity—named it as one of the  10 local transportation-related fledglings for its new Detroit  incubator.

These include the Obama administration’s  manufacturing innovation institute, called Lightweight  Innovations for Tomorrow (LIFT), launched in January, and the  philanthropic New Economy Initiative (NEI), an  economic development initiative working to build a network of  support for entrepreneurs and small businesses. “We don’t support  entrepreneurs directly, but the ecosystem that does,” explained  David Egner, executive director of NEI, which has raised $135  million to fund entrepreneurs and programs like LIFT.', '  Egner said that about 20 percent of its recipients are budding  manufacturers, making things like heated motorcycle jackets,  wooden pallets and carbon dioxide-based coolants for machinery.  Many are former autoworkers who have hooked up with TechTown, a  nonprofit innovation hub and incubator situated in a  135,000-square-foot downtown facility provided by General Motors.  “In 2009 we went to TechTown as the auto bust was happening,”  Egner recalled, “and said, ‘There are folks in the auto industry  who would be entrepreneurs if they had a path.’” TechTown  initially took in 1,200 potential entrepreneurs, he claimed, and  from there 1,400 businesses were started and 14,000 jobs were  created.', '  NEI also sponsors NEIdeas, a program that will reward a total of  $500,000 in cash awards to more than 30 existing businesses in  2015 through the ”$10K Challenge” and the ”$100K Challenge,”  contests that invite fledgling entrepreneurs to pitch their ideas  for new businesses that need funding.

47,A shoemaker’s quest to return manufacturing to New England,2013-10-23T16:57:10+0000,"['  Doug Clark is a shoe veteran. During his 30-year career, the New  England-based footwear maker has scoured Asia for affordable  labor to make outdoor adventure shoes. He’s been to China more  than 75 times. ', '  But Clark is tired of training a steady stream of new  workers. Even laborers earning about $5,000 a year (a good salary  by Chinese standards) grow weary of making shoes, which is laborious.  Work rooms can be hot and dusty. Workers eventually want to  move up the manufacturing food chain, to sit in quiet labs and  assemble pristine tech parts for mobile devices. ', '  “Taiwan, Thailand, China. Every single time, you train a new  workforce. And the cycle is getting faster and faster,” Clark  said. “The sustainable answer is to find a new process. It’s not  to find a new workforce” in an untapped emerging economy.      ', '  Driven by a combination of factors, including new technology,  rising production costs overseas and a growing appetite for “Made  in USA” goods, Clark is doing something few American entrepreneurs have done in years:  building a shoe manufacturing plant in the U.S.    ', '  “That’s very rare these days,” said Matt Priest, president of the  Footwear Distributors  and Retailers of America. Roughly 99 percent of shoes sold in  the U.S. are made abroad. “You can probably count them on your  hands,” he said of the number of shoe factories remaining in the  U.S. ', '  Hoping to promote his planned factory and to generate money,  Clark’s company, New  England Footwear, is conducting a crowdfunding campaign that aims to  raise $150,000 by Nov. 4.', '  Clark’s career path is in many ways a proxy for global  manufacturing. In the 1970s, American footwear makers took the  fork in the road to South Korea. Big global footwear brands set  up shop there and eventually hopscotched to other Asian  countries, including Taiwan and China, in search of lower labor  costs. That is what footwear makers live and die by, as 40 to 50  parts must be assembled to make an average pair of shoes.   ', '  Today, though, more manufacturers are getting hit by the rising  costs of doing business in China—especially small and midsize businesses,  which can’t absorb macro-economic trends. China’s annual  consumer  inflation rose to a seven-month high of 3.1 percent  in September. ', '  As costs there rise, China can charge more for products and  services. That spells bad news for U.S. consumers looking for  inexpensive merchandise at big-box retailers—and  for American entrepreneurs doing business on the  mainland.', '  Fueled in part by rising inflation, China’s market share of  footwear manufacturing has been declining. About 84 percent  of shoes sold in the U.S. are made in China—the lowest level  in seven years, according to data from the Footwear Distributors  and Retailers of America.', '  More footwear makers are thinking they need to diversify beyond  China, according to Priest. The association’s annual “Footwear  Traffic, Distribution” conference ends Wednesday, and a lot of talk at the gathering, in Long Beach, Calif., has been  about seeking new solutions to rising costs.', '“People are looking  at a lot of alternatives: Nicaragua, Ethiopia, Cambodia,” Priest  said. “It’s a different and dynamic time.”', '  (Read more: ‘Made in USA’  fuels new manufacturing hubs in apparel)', ' New England’s shoe manufacturing roots', '  While many footwear makers are looking to new production regions, Clark is betting on New England, which has rich manufacturing roots. Most innovations in shoemaking came from there between 1880 and 1970. A key development was  a “lasting” machine, invented in 1888 in Lynn, Mass. It stitched the upper parts of shoes to soles, paving the  way for affordable, mass-produced footwear. ', 'More than 15,000  factories flourished in New England up until the 1980s, but the appetite for innovation receded incrementally. Meanwhile, Clark, a history buff and University of New Hampshire graduate, had landed his  first job as a technician at Nike’s research lab in Exeter, N.H.—since  relocated to Portland, Ore. ', 'Clark learned the fundamentals of shoe design, every stitch and seam, and how it  affects the wearer’s performance and comfort. ', '  But while Clark was tinkering and testing, shoe factories  nearby were shuttering. He was already seeing the  cracks in the industry and the consequences of shipping production jobs overseas.', '“Even in the ’80s, we knew there was  something wrong,” he said. “It’s crazy that we let this  industry slip away here.”', '  This is where Clark’s manufacturing dream comes into  play. ', '  By the mid-2000s, Clark was leading innovation at another outdoor  footwear and apparel company, Timberland. The task at hand was to  remove cement from a shoe prototype. (If you’ve ever wondered why  some shoes are as heavy as bowling balls and never seem to wear  out, it’s because roughly 30 percent of the weight in an average shoe is cement.)', 'Removing the cement and eliminating related manufacturing  steps, such as excessive stitching and costly steel molds, resulted in a lighter but still sturdy shoe, produced with 50  percent less labor than required in traditional shoemaking. Such  innovation is sometimes called smart, or lean, manufacturing.', '  “I thought, ‘Wow. We designed a lot of labor out of there,’ ”  Clark, now 57, recalled. “And if you don’t need labor, you don’t need  China.”', '  Clark eventually bought that innovative technology from  Timberland and founded his own active footwear  company in 2008.', '  Last week, Clark moved his 12 employees to New England Footwear’s new, 10,000-square-foot headquarters—offices and a  warehouse—in Stratham, N.H., southwest of Portsmouth. The  goal is to buy equipment and build an additional  6,000 square feet to make footwear locally. ', 'Clark estimates that the new factory will employ about 200 workers, and  his goals include moving half of his production back to the U.S. from China by 2017. He ultimately wants to bring it all back. ', 'Clark’s technology will increase productivity and remove  about 70 percent of the labor required versus conventional “cut,  glue and stitch” processes used in Asian  factories. Based on New England Footwear’s productivity upgrades, shoes made domestically will have almost the same labor costs as those made in  Asia. ', '“We will pay our employees about $30,000 a year here in New  England, versus $4,500 a year, which is the average wage in China right  now,” Clark said. The idea is to share the cost savings from better production methods in the form of higher wages to American workers.', '  (Read more: Ten cool  American-made products)', ' Reshoring, and a little help from China', '  Clark estimates the new shoe factory will cost roughly $5  million. And in an unexpected twist on the “Made in USA”  movement, the small-business  owner so far has two investment offers from Chinese  companies. ', '  Clark has talked to some 50 American private equity  companies and has “zero offers,” he said. “In some way, it’s  ironic.” ', 'Potential investors are skeptical about a broad consumer  appetite for American-made goods, he said, “but I believe there’s never  been a better time,” Clark said. ', 'Some recent research bears out  that forecast.', '  The Boston Consulting Group found that most U.S.-based  manufacturing executives plan to bring production back to the  U.S. from China or are actively considering it. The survey,  conducted in August, focused on companies with sales of more than $1  billion. ', '  The survey results, released last month, showed a 47 percent rise in “reshoring”  consideration among respondents in 18 months. The percentage of  executives, who are already moving production to the U.S. from  China, or who plan to do so within the next two years, more  than doubled, to 21 percent, during the period, according to  BCG.', '  Key factors in reshoring—or the reversal of overseas outsourcing—include labor costs, proximity to  customers and product quality. ', '“The most fundamental drivers of  reshoring are the increasing competitiveness of U.S. labor rates  and very cheap energy costs to manufacture in the U.S.,”  said Justin Rose, a Chicago-based partner for BCG and a  co-author of the research. The unlocking  of shale oil and gas reserves has helped lower U.S. natural  gas prices, an important factor in a lot of manufacturing, he said.', '  BCG also estimates that wage and benefit increases of 15 percent to 20  percent a year at an average Chinese factory will slash China’s  labor-cost advantage to 39 percent by 2015 from 55 percent today.', '  But Clark didn’t need a study to tell him what he has suspected  for years: The math of manufacturing in China is  changing.', 'In Clark’s crowdfunding effort to  raise money as well as awareness for his U.S. factory,  a $45 donation gets you a pair of the first U.S.A.-made Comp XT shoe models. A gift of $65 gets you a pair of of Asian-made Comp XTs.

51,Biden’s climate change plan and the battle for America’s most threatened workers,2021-01-31T14:00:01+0000,"['America has been here and done this before, with a spotty track record. Steel, timber, manufacturing. Market and political forces have reshaped — and in some cases, wreaked havoc on — local economies powered by a single industry. Now as the Biden administration outlines its climate change policies, one of the more challenging goals is making sure fossil-fuel driven economies, like coal towns from Appalachia to the Illinois Basin, tribal nations and Powder River Basin in the Western U.S., are not left behind.', 'Amid the slew of executive orders on climate change signed by President Biden on Wednesday was an interagency working group on coal and power plant communities and economic revitalization. The idea is not new. Labor groups and climate policymakers around the globe call it “just transition” for communities on the wrong end of the shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy — a town where a coal mine is shut down or a power plant powered by coal is closed. But unlike the booms and busts that both coal and oil towns are accustomed to surviving, a permanent shift is different.', 'In the U.S., policy efforts are already underway. The Obama administration created the Power Initiative in 2015 to focus on economic development in regions like Appalachia, and even though Congress refused to approve an initial Trump administration budget request to scrap it, funding levels remain too low for the challenge. In the past year, Colorado and New Mexico approved legislation to create just transition offices in their states — a state representative in West Virginia recently introduced a similar measure. But experts, including those working on these new state-level efforts, say the scale of the task is massive and much more federal support will be needed.', '“I think the Power Initiative under Obama was a good start, but it just wasn’t anywhere near enough money,” said Brandon Dennison, head of Appalachian economic development firm Coalfield Development. “Compare it with other industries, like auto bailouts or agricultural subsidies. It needs to be in the billions and it was in the millions ... and it and was under perpetual threat.”', 'One analysis by economists looking at the impact coal has on the economy of Eastern Kentucky found that coal was more important to the region than the auto industry was to Detroit.', '“The basic issue is one of equity,” said Wade Buchanan, who heads the state of Colorado’s new Office of Just Transition. “As a nation, and as world, we are transitioning from carbon-based fuels to cleaner fuels, but thinking the workers are transitioning from carbon-based employers to clean-energy employers is the wrong way to think about it. Locally, this is basic rural economic development. ... Clean energy might be part of the answer, but it is not the answer. ... In 2008, we tried to rescue an industry. This isn’t so much a rescue as phasing it out in a humane and just way. And it becomes a weight that the state can’t bear alone that creates incredible levels of inequity.”', 'The Biden administration’s new interagency working group is just a first step, but if there is real follow-through and it is coordinated with the local representatives, it could be one key to moving politicians and stakeholders past a jobs debate that has often devolved into sound bites.', 'Backers of projects like the Keystone XL Pipeline cancelled by the Biden administration cite the thousands of jobs lost. From the corporate world, a growing number of the largest companies say renewable energy is an engine of job creation. Meanwhile, key swing votes on Capitol Hill, such as moderate Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and moderate Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, represent states where fossil fuels remain critical and workers, families and communities remain skeptical about the promise of new opportunities.The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated the number of oil and gas extraction jobs at roughly 160,000 at the end of 2020, and coal mining jobs slipped below 50,000 total by year-end. Those numbers can appear small — Amazon hired over 400,000 workers during the pandemic and now employs more than one million globally — but as America and companies like Amazon transition to a green economy, these extraction jobs are concentrated in many rural regions where local economies are reliant on the mining and drilling, including the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico; the Marcellus in Pennsylvania and Ohio; the Bakken in North Dakota; and in parts of California, Colorado, Louisiana, Oklahoma. In many, economic hardship and unemployment during the pandemic were higher than the national average — the size of the oil and gas jobs labor force fell to a multi-decade low in 2020 after having been as high as 600,000 jobs just a few years ago.', 'For every direct jobs lost in a power plant or in mining, the community loses four indirect jobs, according to Heidi Binko, executive director of the Just Transition Fund, which has been working on projects in coal communities since 2015.', 'Even though it is coal right now that has seen its fortunes, and jobs, shrink the most consistently and rapidly, the broader workforce supported by oil and gas numbers in the millions and with decisions like GM’s this week to fully transition to electric vehicles over the next 14 years, the labor market and economic ripple effects will be widespread.', 'The U.S. oil industry is expected to contract by 20% in the next decade and by 95% between 2031–2050, according to the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The natural gas industry isn’t expected to begin its decline until 2030, but decline by 75% in the two decades after that. Any forecast is based on assumptions that will be tested by the global appetite for aggressive climate policies, and the political reality could result in a slower decline. But many experts do agree that the coal industry may be gone for good, even by the end of this decade.', '“We started with coal knowing these are economic adjustment problems and what we could learn with coal we could apply to other transition communities ... the lessons are transferable and can be used as a blueprint,” Binko said.', 'While the overall number of jobs to be displaced are relatively small compared to the overall economy — 1.7% of the labor force — and the estimated 34,000 jobs lost per year through 2050 are far less than millions forecast in new job creation related to the energy transition, they are “also a matter of strategic politics,” according to the UMass research, especially as the percentage of domestic fossil fuels consumed in the U.S. has reached 96% in recent years on a net basis.', '“We lost so much time to delay and obfuscation,” said Daniel Raimi, a fellow at the nonpartisan policy group Resources for the Future. “It’s time to get to work and in my view that means not just reducing emissions but addressing the workforce and community challenges it will bring. There are some relatively moderate senators who have powerful platforms and lots of fossil energy interests in their states and my hope is we make some progress.”', 'Survey data from the Yale Program on Climate Communication finds that the majority of the U.S. public is in favor of financial support for these communities. When asked how the government should spend revenue from a potential carbon tax, 72% of registered voters said assisting workers in the coal industry should be a priority. Only investment in new technologies and infrastructure spending had higher response rates.', '“Americans don’t want to leave these communities behind,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, senior research scientist and director of the Yale program. “Americans have big hearts on this. But how do we do it? ... It doesn’t just mean unemployment benefits and making coal workers wind technicians. That most likely won’t be most of them, and they also don’t want to leave West Virginia, or Texas or Oklahoma. They have generations invested. We need to bring the opportunity to them.”', '“We are in the middle of the energy transition right now and it will be ongoing and workers are going to be hurt unless new public policy and investment is designed to support them,” said Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a labor organization focused on climate, clean energy and economic development. “The politics and economy of coal in Appalachia has made sure public policy doesn’t allow for new sectors to compete. But it is unrealistic to think we can move all dislocated coal miners into solar and wind jobs. We need to think more broadly.”', 'One idea that has gained traction from many experts focused on this energy transition issue is for workers in fossil-fuel regions to be provided work repairing the damages left behind by legacy strip mines and oil wells, sometimes for safety and health reasons and also in some to case to rehabilitate the land for new uses.', '“We blew the tops off hundreds of mountains in places these people live in and drink water in and there is an enormous need to not just abandon these people and places but to restore them and hire people to restore them,” Leiserowitz said. “There are hundreds of thousands of abandoned oil and gas wells that are toxic and leaking methane to this day.”', 'A significant federal program to plug orphan wells could create tens of thousands of jobs, potentially as many as 120,000 jobs if 500,000 wells were plugged, with the largest number of orphaned wells in Pennsylvania, according to a recent study from the Columbia Center on Global Energy Policy. More than 76,000 direct energy industry jobs were lost from February to June of 2020 as Covid-19 increased pain in the energy sector, especially in rural regions where domestic oil and gas production occurs. The industry labor force size sank to its lowest level since 2006, before the shale boom. The costs of plugging the known inventory of 56,600 orphaned wells could range from $1.4 billion to $2.7 billion, while expanding the program to identify and plug 500,000 wells could cost between $12 billion and $24 billion.', 'Yale’s survey work shows widespread support from registered voters in the U.S. to create jobs for coal workers and oil and gas workers — jobs permanently shutting down mines safely and shutting off abandoned wells, with 83% of voters saying they support creating a jobs program that would hire unemployed coal workers to safely close down old coal mines and restore the natural landscape, as well as a jobs program that would hire unemployed oil and gas workers to safely close down thousands of abandoned oil and gas wells.', 'Louisiana is among the states which has had its own program in place to hire former oil and gas workers to find and cap abandoned wells, which state audits can often miss, and its officials expect that problem to grow over time as more companies in the oil and gas sector face financial distress and abandon operations.', 'There is no shortage of work to be done cleaning up polluted sites, and at millions of orphaned wells, soon-to-be orphaned wells, and hundreds of abandoned coal mines, as well as even older silver and copper mines. Sen. Manchin of West Virginia has sponsored legislation to fund mine remediation and is seen as a key mover on efforts to pass legislation that includes advanced manufacturing credits that might be geared to hard-hit fossil fuel economic regions.', 'There are economic development experts within these regions who are hesitant to place too much focus on abandoned mine or well work, even though it is estimated that years of work could lay ahead — and in the case of oil and gas wells being plugged, potentially decades of jobs around the country. A key question is how spending on these jobs is weighed against spending on broader workforce development and training.', '“It is an example of how you can keep these people in communities where they are and rehabilitate these communities and natural landscapes. It gives them a runway because it is not a forever project, but it does give them time to invest,” Leiserowitz said.', 'The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established Department of Energy authority to provide technology and financial assistance to help states clean up these projects, but to date it has not been funded.', 'A carbon tax is the most obvious big-ticket way to pay for these jobs and also make additional investments, though its legislative outlook is difficult to assess given decades of efforts ending in failure. Raimi said there are estimates as high as $100 billion a year that could be raised through a carbon tax and spent on a variety of purposes, including reclamation of fossil fuel sites and workforce development.', '“Right now, the most obvious source of funding is debt. That is how we seem to be funding most things. That can’t go on forever. Long term we need to think about raising large amounts of revenue,” Raimi said.', 'But thinking all displaced workers will want to do this remediation work remains an assumption rather than fact.', '“One big knowledge gap we have now is what the existing fossil fuel workforce might want to do if their current jobs go away,” Raimi said. “I spent a lot of time in oil and gas country and people who work for those companies are proud of their jobs. It’s not clear how to replace those, but it is our job. We need to do a lot better understanding the best potential matches,” he said.', 'Sectors such as a shifting electricity grid and new transmission and power plant construction put the labor movement in a position to advocate for a jobs policy that benefits these workers. And many unions have come together on climate change and job opportunities, even as some unions jobs are lost on projects like Keystone.', 'Pipelines have created good jobs for some in Appalachia and while there are environmental problems, “folks are doing what they need to do to feed families,” Dennison said. “Being dependent on fossil fuels has gotten us into generational dependence. ... We will need some stop gaps as far as jobs. Renewables have potential, agriculture has potential, but those sectors will take time and those sectors alone can’t employ everyone.”', '“Some things we can’t find agreement on, but let’s not lose the forest for the trees,” Walsh said.', 'Even as union jobs were tied up in the Keystone XL Pipeline, union groups, including steel workers and plumbers and pipefitters, are signing on to net zero pledges not only to address the climate crisis but the crisis of economic inequality, he said.', '“Literally every major economic shift of the past several decades has been manifestly unjust for American workers and policy makers failed to craft responses that were fair and effective,” Walsh said. “Working people should not suffer due to efforts related to climate change and job No. 1 as we lose jobs in incumbent energy industries is that we create jobs in new industries and sectors that are just as high quality and we are not there yet,” he said.', 'The Power Initiative began with a focus on coal workers but officials involved in its administration realized quickly that the issue of a declining jobs industry could not be separated from broader family and community issues, such as the opioid epidemic experienced in Appalachia. Drug rehab programs and broadband development became part of the effort as it widens its scope from thinking narrowly about transitioning jobs.', 'West Virginia’s manufacturing sector made up 13.1% of jobs in 1990, but by 2017, accounted for only 6.1%. Mining and logging jobs fell from 5.4% of state employment to 2.7% in the same time period, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Roughly 16% of the state’s 1.8 million people live in poverty, compared with 10.9% nationally, according to statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau.', 'In eastern Kentucky, 38 of 54 counties in the Appalachian Regional Commission are designated as distressed. Kentucky has more distressed counties and communities than any other Appalachian state and not one ARC county is rated as “competitive.”', '“Broadband access is so crucial for rural communities where they barely still have dial up. There is no way you can participate in the economy let alone compete if you don’t have strong broadband,” Leiserowitz.', 'The communities most dependent on a single source of employment are the ones least likely to have the capacity to transition an economy on their own and the continued shift in the economy will only make that limited capacity worse as direct royalties paid by fossil fuel companies and other forms of community investments the dominant industry has provided wane.', 'The Appalachian region experienced three-quarters of the mining job losses in the U.S. in the past decade and approximately 30,000 direct coal mining job net losses across eastern Kentucky, West Virginia, southern Virginia, and Alabama. And that has a ripple effect in the form of supply chains linked by rail and trucks that cross states, lost incomes for customers of local businesses, and declining tax revenue.', '“Once you move outside the direct coal jobs ... the ripple effect is pretty massive,” Dennison said.  ', 'State economies are not closed systems, and most of the coal mined in Colorado goes to other states or for other purposes than general electricity. Close to half of coal burned in Colorado power plants comes from Wyoming.', 'Geography will create other imbalances.', '“Jobs lost in west Texas will not obviously become new jobs in west Texas. There will be regional challenges,” Raimi said.', 'The massive layoffs already experienced in the coal sector are more related to market forces — including automation, the natural gas boom and renewables coming down the cost curve and becoming competitive — than just policy decisions. The layoffs will continue to be an issue for years to come. For oil and gas workers there is more time to plan, but getting the transition right with coal is the first step because it is happening much more rapidly.', 'Workers and the communities that have long lived with declines and then bursts back in economic growth over multiple generations can have the perception if they hold tight the jobs will come back, and if the jobs don’t come back, they can’t see themselves in any other work. Experts say trying to overturn a culture or think only in terms of a specific worker will fail.', '“The transition is happening, but it feels for lots of people like the transition has been forced on us,” Dennison said. “The worst thing we can do is lie to ourselves or be told coal will come back. ... Even when coal was booming we still led the nation in poverty and poor health outcomes. We have generational challenges we need to overcome. It’s so deep,” he said.', 'A reasonable path forward to diversity a fossil fuel economy is a long-term undertaking. New highways and rail and broadband, and workforce development, are all part of it.', '“The strategy can’t just be get money to coal workers to help them get into another industry when the real issue is generational poverty as result of generations’ addiction to this one resource,” Dennison said.', 'In eastern Kentucky coal country, progress has been made retraining dislocated coal miners to work in sectors including IT, agriculture, advanced manufacturing and health care, and regional efforts have also been forced to help some residents move away for better opportunities.', '“We are looking at an industry that is going away basically,” said Jeff Whitehead, executive director of the Eastern Kentucky Concentrated Employment Program, which has worked on coal miner job transitions and says the effort requires nothing short of a “rural czar” in the White House.', '“We’re working on changing a way of life and economy, and that is a more intense, longer-term transition. It is not something you can just throw money at and train a few people and it goes away,” Whitehead said. “In Appalachia and in eastern Kentucky coal fields, the industry as a driving force of economy was already struggling but it was the mainstay of the stability there. ... Going away permanently might be down the road, but the facts are the facts. Do I think coal will boom again and we will have in eastern Kentucky or other places a massive workforce again? No, I don’t, and if you proceed with that mindset then you are just putting yourself further behind the curve of transition.”', 'The energy industry is looking at technology like carbon capture as a way to reach net zero emissions goals without abandoning the oil and gas exploration and production business. But even experts willing to give the technological concept and its big industry backers, such as Occidental Petroleum — and more recently Elon Musk, whose SpaceX has plans to drill in Texas for natural gas to use in rocket fuel — a serious look rather than dismiss it as a PR stunt, say it isn’t likely to change the overall direction of jobs in the energy industry in the decades to come.', 'Over 2021–2030, the total number of displaced workers will average about 12,000. Between 2031–2050, that is projected to rise to an average of about 34,000 workers per year, according to the UMass Amherst Political Economy Research Institute. It estimates that in the next decade, the total costs of funding this transition to be about $1.2 billion per year over the next decade. Other estimates assume the price tag will be even higher. ', '“I think it is safe to say that if we want to get to net zero in the second half of the 21st century, we will have far fewer people working in oil and gas and coal. There is no way around that,” Raimi said.', 'In some respects, Colorado feels fortunate to have any time. Its coal plant closures are scheduled for years 2024 through 2030 and some of the first challenges are more manageable than what may come later. Coal makes sense as the first industry to transition because not only is it the dirtiest but also easier than transitioning national car fleets. “You close a power plant and you make a measurable dent in emissions in the region,” Buchanan said.', 'The state’s best example of the energy transition is the town of Pueblo, but Buchanan said pointing to it as a model is imperfect because it is one coal power plant employing less than 100 people and a town that is larger than other coal towns in the state, like Craig and Hayden, which are facing a huge proportion of their workers being displaced as well as the loss of the main source of property tax revenue.', '“We don’t have an answer yet in Craig and Hayden,” he said. “Craig and Hayden are ground zero for this.”', 'Towns where power plants close across the U.S. can lose upwards of 70%-80% of tax revenue, according to the Just Transition Fund.', 'The big job losses in the Colorado coal industry will take start in 2025 and it won’t be complete until 2030 or later. Between now and then the economic development issues in rural areas need to go beyond the soundbites.', '“They’ve had the best jobs, best paying and secure, and they are very nervous about how to visualize their future. … it is hard to pay the kind of wage scale they are used to,” Buchanan said.', 'Tourism and existing industries like the ski resorts offer some opportunities, but Covid hit these hard in the short term which exacerbated the fears, and Buchanan added that “a miner doesn’t want to be a ski lift operator.”', 'At least for a period of three to four years, Colorado’s advisory board expects there may be wage replacement programs necessary and the numbers get big quickly. Colorado only has 2,000 coal workers — which is small compared to Appalachia — but that is not taking into account the supply chains. The state estimates the initial cost to support coal workers at $100 million over a decade and that is not insignificant for a state budget. And Colorado is just 2% of coal mining in the U.S. Its neighbor Wyoming has 20 times the numbers of coal workers, and less money, and one congressional district. And when the issue is Colorado’s oil and gas industry, that is ten times the size of its coal workforce.', 'The UMass Amherst research team forecasts a cost of $3.8 billion per year 2030 through 2050 for just transition policies.', 'States are also beginning to think about the creation of transition funds to replace the lost tax revenue from power plant closures, including in Minnesota and Pennsylvania. The first state transition fund in the U.S. to deal with the pending closure of a power plant was in Huntley, New York.', 'Colorado is a “strong local control state,” according to Buchanan, and its residents do not want handouts, but the forecasts imply federal support will be needed.', 'He had meetings in Colorado coal towns before Covid-19 and found among the residents the range of skepticism and fear you would expect: calling it politics and not science, not wanting handouts from the federal government, and others saying even if they don’t like what they see, they do need to move forward. ', '“That’s natural. These are communities that have become a little cliche to say it, but they powered our prosperity and they are quite proud of what they’ve done, and should be, and now they are being told for the good of humanity they need to stop. That’s a hard message to take, even if you understand and believe in it, and if you don’t, it becomes even harder.”', 'The skepticism runs to the “just transition” concept and his office’s work, too. Some residents think the whole effort is to make the government and liberals feel better about themselves. “They are totally justified in being nervous,” Buchanan said.', 'Opportunities in states like West Virginia, such as solar energy and farming on former mine sites are real, and agtech companies like AppHarvest in Kentucky which went public last year, provide a glimpse of future opportunities, but not a fully realized vision of job opportunities or broad economies.', '“Folks in our [West Virginia] communities see through the soundbites on new green jobs,” said Dennison. He said the Biden administration needs to understand that talk about “training those folks” has never been specific enough and existing federal job training programs have a mixed track record, which has made the community highly skeptical.', 'The idea of justice in the energy transition can be defined many ways, and communities in the line of hurricanes, flooding and wildfires, as well as urban communities facing long-term-health issues related to air quality, are among the stakeholder priorities. But climate advocates pushing for rapid change say we also need to think more about how we characterize the fossil-fuel towns of the past century.', '“I think one of first things this nation should do, from the level of Biden down to the grass roots is stop with the demonization of fossil fuels,” Leiserowitz said. “The CEOs knew better, what they knew, when they knew it, is a different conversation. But the working class, the oil drillers and coal miners, they built modern America, they risked their lives to go into mines and do the dirtiest, most dangerous work in the country. These people and communities deserve to feel proud of what they did. And now that we’re in this race against time it is our responsibility as a society to not leave them, or the landscapes in which they live, behind.” ']"

Cyclical sectors, like materials, industrials and consumer discretionary were outperformers, and tech held its own with a 2.6% gain. Real estate investment trusts were also among the best sectors up nearly 3.5%.', '“Unlike prior earnings seasons that we’ve seen recently, the expectations are a bit more muted heading into this earnings season, as far as analysts’ revisions are concerned,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke. “That tends to lower the bar, which makes the earnings season much more manageable. Volatility is a code word for ‘down.’ Manageable is a code word for ‘up.’ That’s a decent set-up and just the fact that the market has been down heading into the earnings season.”', 'Hickey said it’s not clear the strong surge in stocks in the last few sessions is signaling an all-clear for usually negative tone of October.', '“We’ll have a better idea once we get through all these earnings reports coming up next week,” he said. “That’s going to be the big tell.

I think the story here is the financial and cyclical parts of the market are really going to surprise, as long as you have disruption. As long as disruption continues, it’s going to benefit certain companies. It may be transitory, but transitory could last a year or two.”', 'Golub said it could be a risk for the market if only some groups are earnings winners. “If we can get an aggregate beat of 8% to 10%, but it’s being held up by a smaller part of the market, and the median company is not delivering stronger earnings numbers, it is a negative,” he said. “It’s one of my concerns about the earnings season.”', 'Golub said investors have been worried about margins being squeezed because of higher input costs, but he said a bigger concern is that companies are unable to make deliveries because they don’t have products.', '“They got an order. They can’t fulfil it, and they can’t book the sale. That’s the risk here. I think it’s real. Inventories are being adjusted further down, and backlogs are being adjusted further up.

The G20 did not specifically name China, but the  country accounts for about half the world’s steel production  — up from roughly a third in 2008.', '  Chinese companies ramped up capacity several years ago in  anticipation of a demand surge that didn’t materialize  completely, resulting in mounting losses for the industry in  China. For the country’s steel companies that issue bonds,  total losses exploding from 678 million  yuan ($101.7 million) in 2014 to 150 billion  yuan ($22.5 billion) in 2015, according to China data firm Wind Information.', '  Wind data also showed that for those steel companies, debt  holdings have an average expiration of just 18 months from now, and 82  percent of that debt issuance is being used to pay off old debt  rather than directly supporting business operations.

While doing so, authorities must manage a  delicate balance between cutting back the loss-making steel  industry and maintaining social stability with jobs and tax  revenue for the governments in those regions.  ', 'Recent headlines have appeared to indicate Chinese progress in making the steel  sector more efficient. Dongbei Special Steel defaulted on a  short-term note earlier this year.

And stimulus failed to support efforts  to develop a consumption-driven economy.

Steel rebar prices jumped to a near two-year high earlier  this year, and briefly traded around those levels again in the  last few weeks.

Meanwhile, most China watchers are  skeptical that the G20′s focus on addressing overcapacity in steel  will see material results. A global forum on the issue proposed by the G20, which would be facilitated  by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), would have a year to in which to return its findings.', '  China has promised to cut 45 million tonnes in steel capacity  this year, and as of July had only reached 47 percent of that  goal, according to official reports.

The battery works with a process the company calls “reversible rusting,” in which the battery charges and discharges by converting iron back and forth into rust. By using these inexpensive materials, the company aims to have its batteries cost less than $20 per kilowatt-hour, which experts say is up to one-tenth the cost of the more common lithium-ion batteries in use today.', 'In order for carbon emissions to hit net-zero by mid-century, meaning that the globe is absorbing as much greenhouse gases as are still being emitted, solar and wind capacity will need to quadruple and investments in renewable energy will need to triple by 2030, according to comments from United Nations Secretary General António Guterres.', 'For that to happen, there also must be a ramp up of long duration battery storage.

Jacobson, a professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford.', '“If the cost is actually $20 per kilowatt-hour, that would be a breakthrough and allow the rapid large-scale transformation of all electricity world wide to clean, renewable (wind-water-solar) electricity,” Jacobson said.', 'Battery tech at the $20 per kilowatt-hour price point “would eliminate the need for natural gas or any other type of combustion fuel for backup power,” Jacobson told CNBC. “It would break any chance of nuclear power from playing a role in an energy future. It would end coal, fuel oil, and natural gas as fuels for electricity generation.”', 'Sepulveda, who is currently working as a consultant, is a bit more conservative about what $20 per kilowatt-hour means.', 'He said the threshold is meaningful “with very high penetration of renewables (not our current levels).” So in order for $20 per kilowatt-hour to be meaningful for the quest for carbon reduction, there will have to be more renewable energy production on the ground. “The question then becomes, is there a market in the near future for these technologies? I think that the answer is that there is going to be a niche market for long-duration-energy-storage in the short-medium term, but a big one in the long-term.”', 'Even while ”$20 per kilowatt-hour is very cheap,” Sepulveda and his co-authors determined it the price of long-duration battery storage would need to be less than $10 per kilowatt-hour to “meaningfully displace” other forms of firm energy generation, which refers to energy technologies that can be counted on to meet demand when it is needed in all seasons and over weeks or longer.', 'The demand for multi-day-battery technology depends on the development of other technologies, too.', '“While it seems plausible that iron-air batteries are less expensive than lithium-ion batteries, the more interesting comparison will be with other seasonal storage technologies, for instance, hydrogen conversion,” Reichelstein said to CNBC.']"

Since then, the institute note, three smelters have being restarted and one has announced a capacity expansion. It said the U.S. aluminum companies have added about 300 jobs, and companies that process aluminum into finished products have expanded, generating $3.3 billion in investments that could employ 2,000 more workers. Overall, U.S. manufacturing has added more than 200,000 jobs since just before the tariffs were put in place, according to the Labor Department’s November jobs report last week.', 'Tariffs collected on aluminum products increased by $124 million in October, despite a 4 percent decline in the value of imports, according to data released by Tariffs Hurt the Heartland and compiled by The Trade Partnership.', 'But the full effect of the higher costs and disrupted supply chains are still working their way through the economy, “It’s very easy to say ‘Ah, ha, these haven’t happened yet.’ … The last thing anyone wants to do is lay off workers,” said Dan Anthony, vice president at The Trade Partnership, an economic consulting firm that has done several studies of tariff impacts.', 'Pressure is growing for the administration to lift the tariffs on U.S. allies. In announcing its support for the USMCA trade agreement reached this year by the United States, Mexico and Canada, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce called for steel and aluminum tariffs to be removed. “These tariffs — imposed on our partners as a negotiating tactic — have invited $15 billion in counter-tariffs on U.S. agricultural and manufactured goods,” U.S. Chamber President and CEO Thomas Donohue said in a statement. “They must be eliminated without delay.”', 'But supporters say there should be a period of time to verify that products are no longer sold here at artificially low subsidized prices. “There are some important national security considerations,” said former Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., who is working with the American Primary Aluminum Association. “I don’t think we ever want to be in a position where we have products that are essential to the United States military that are made from aluminum or steel entirely outsourced through foreign producers, that would put us at their mercy in time of conflict.”', 'Critics say there has been little evidence the tariffs are affecting overcapacity in China, which continues to subsidize its aluminum industry. Even supporters are concerned the blanket tariff approach may not be the most effective action.', '“The remaining problem in the industry is this massive excess capacity based in China, and unfortunately, the way the tariffs are structured, they didn’t really address that issue head-on,” said Scott.']"

But the boundaries of trade policy are being tested by the scope of Mr. Trump’s multifront trade war with allies and adversaries alike, which includes tariffs on up to $200 billion worth of goods from China and possible tariffs on automobiles and auto parts.', 'Mr. Trump’s decision to impose 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, even from allies like Canada, Mexico, the European Union and Japan, is just one part of that battle. But it has drawn a strong rebuke from foreign governments, Republican lawmakers and many business groups, including automakers, beverage companies, farm equipment manufacturers and food packagers, who say it will inflict financial pain on companies that employ millions of American workers.', 'Read more from the New York Times:', 'To help minimize the impact, the administration established a process for companies to request “exclusions” for any product they could not otherwise buy in the United States, such as tire rods or razor blades. But the Commerce Department, which is overseeing the process, also allowed American companies to argue against an exclusion request. The metal tariffs are the only ones so far to have such a process.', 'Since May, companies have filed more than 20,000 requests for steel tariff exemptions. As of the end of July, the Commerce Department had denied 639 requests.', 'Half of those denials came in cases where United States Steel, Nucor or a third large steel maker, AK Steel Holding Corporation, filed an objection, a New York Times analysis shows. Nearly all of the rest were in cases where the company applying for an exclusion erred in its submission, Commerce Department officials say.', 'Department officials said on Friday that they have not granted a single steel exclusion request that drew an objection. They have granted 20 aluminum exclusions over an objection, because the objecting company did not actually cite the product in question.', 'Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, has defended the exclusion process and said the steel makers’ ability to provide products should be taken into account.', '“If a product is available in enough quantity and quality to meet demand, the objection is generally sustained,” Mr. Ross said in an email. “Each situation is treated individually. If no objection has been filed, and there is no specific national security issue regarding the import, we generally grant the exclusion request.”', 'Mr. Trump has made no secret that he wants to boost American steel makers, and several of his top administration officials have deep ties to the steel industry. As the head of a private equity fund, Mr. Ross bought and operated several steel companies, which he later sold at a profit, and he sat on a steel company’s board of directors until his confirmation.', 'The United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, represented United States Steel and other steel manufacturers in private practice as a lawyer, and so did his deputy, Jeffrey Gerrish. Nucor spent $1 million to fund a documentary, “Death by China,” made by Peter Navarro, a Trump trade adviser, in 2011.', 'Nucor has played a role in one-quarter of the denials. In most cases, at least one other company also objected to a request that drew an objection from the three large steel makers.', '“The tariffs are working,” said John Ferriola, Nucor’s chairman, chief executive and president. “They are protecting our national security and stimulating additional domestic steel production.”', 'The rejected companies do not agree.', '“They’re hiding behind the government to try to keep them going,” said Joel Johnson, the chief executive of the United States arm of Borusan Mannesmann, a Turkish-owned manufacturer that imports steel pipesfrom its parent company and finishes them at its plant in Baytown, Tex. The company’s exclusion requests were denied by the Commerce Department after United States Steel and others objected.', 'In a 31-page objection filed in May, United States Steel officials said, “There is no national security interest in drawing further foreign Turkish investment into the United States to produce a product that is already produced in the United States, and for which substantial excess capacity exists.”', 'Mr. Johnson said the company requested an exclusion so it could have time to build a United States-based factory that could produce what it now imports. The investment would create more than 170 jobs, on top of the 264 people Borusan Mannesmann now employs in Texas.', 'He said the objections were an obvious attempt to block the competition that would come from his company’s proposed new mill in Texas. “I’d be doing exactly what they’re doing, if I were them,” he said.', 'The tariffs are beginning to reap dividends for the steel industry — a development that Mr. Trump frequently boasts about.', '“Tariffs have had a tremendous positive impact on our Steel Industry,” Mr. Trump said in a tweet on Saturday.', 'Tweet', 'Nucor reported its highest second-quarter revenue in company history last month. United States Steel said last week that its prices and profits have surged since the tariffs were implemented. Mr. Trump recently flew to Illinois to celebrate increased output and employment at a United States Steel plant in Granite City.', 'Some companies that have been denied exclusions have been forced to enter negotiations with Nucor over supplying steel products that are subject to tariffs or dropping its objections to their requests, according to a lawyer who works with those companies.', 'Critics say the exclusions process has overwhelmed Commerce Department staff members, who do not have the resources to sift through thousands of complicated requests and objections and judge them on their merits. They say the default position is to simply listen to a company that objects, regardless of whether the objection is legitimate.', '“This process was not designed to be successfully navigated” by manufacturers seeking exclusions, said Richard Chriss, the president of the American Institute for International Steel, which has sued to block the tariffs on constitutional grounds.', 'In April, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the panel’s top Democrat, sent a letter to Mr. Ross urging him to improve the process and expressing concern about whether the Commerce Department was taking steps to prevent the program “from being abused for anticompetitive purposes.”', 'The three large steel makers are by far the most aggressive objectors in the exclusions process. Nucor and United States Steel have each filed more than 1,000 objections, some of which overlap. AK Steel has filed nearly 700 objections.', 'The department has granted more than 1,300 steel exclusions. More than 70 percent of those exclusions — nearly 1,000 of them — have gone to a single company that has managed to draw few objections to its requests: South Carolina-based Greenfield Industries, which makes drill bits, saw blades and other cutting tools. Since 2009, Greenfield has been owned by a Chinese company, Top-Eastern.', 'Steel makers’ objections to others’ requests take a variety of forms. Sometimes, the steel makers allege the company seeking an exclusion made an error in its filings. Sometimes, they criticize companies for choosing not to produce steel in the United States and instead buying it from overseas producers; one company’s decision to cease domestic production of steel slab “directly undermines U.S. steel production and should not be rewarded with the requested product exclusions,” Nucor wrote in a comment.', 'Often, the steel makers claim that an American mill is producing the product in question, or could produce it if asked. “Nucor can offer a substitute for the requested product out of stock immediately (i.e., within 8 weeks),” the company wrote in response to an exclusion request from Houston-based SEBA Tubular, which had sought to import steel bars from Turkey, citing insufficient supplies from American mills. “To the extent that further manufacturing is required, Nucor can ship/deliver the product within the above-referenced time frames.”', 'The SEBA request was denied. Company officials did not respond to a request for comment.', 'Mr. Ferriola, the Nucor chairman, said his company generally objects to exclusion requests if it produces the product in question or a substitute, or if it believes that granting the exclusion would undermine national security. “We should be able to compete against any steel maker in the world, but we cannot compete against those who dump artificially cheap steel into our market at prices that are lower than our cost of production,” he said. “That is why Nucor continues to assess market conditions, and will be proactive and aggressive in pursuing trade cases and objecting to exclusion requests, when and where it is appropriate.”', 'Asked if the company’s success in blocking exclusion requests was related to the investment in Mr. Navarro’s film, a company spokeswoman, Katherine Miller, said in an email that “as America’s largest steel producer, we have been actively engaged in the trade arena for almost two decades. Over this time, we have been outspoken that our government must take a much tougher line with countries that continuously violate the rules of free trade. The documentary produced seven years ago provided another medium to discuss this critical economic issue.”', 'A United States Steel spokeswoman, Meghan M. Cox, noted that the company has filed comments on “less than 10 percent of the total requests posted by the Commerce Department” and “only on those tariff exclusion requests that are for products that we make.”', '“With the restart of one blast furnace earlier this year and preparations for another blast furnace restart in October underway at our Granite City Works,” Ms. Cox said, “we are willing and able to support substantial proportions of increased domestic demand for many steel products.”']"

This comes at a time when some manufacturers are already  struggling under the rising cost of raw steel, due to efforts  to prevent foreign countries from dumping cheap supplies in the North  American market.', '  Trump also revealed how he would pressure pipeline companies to  comply: by potentially refusing to exercise eminent domain, the  government’s ability to appropriate private land.', '  “If we’re going to use our powers of eminent domain and all the  other powers, then I want the pipe to be manufactured with United  States steel,” Trump said.', '  Trump signed a presidential memo last week that instructs the secretary of Commerce to develop a plan that  would require any company that builds a pipeline within U.S.  borders to use American-made materials and equipment. ', '  That order accompanied two other executive  actions aimed at advancing fiercely contested oil  pipeline projects. Those were a boon to the companies behind the  pipelines, TransCanada andEnergy Transfer Partners.', '  But in a speech at a retreat for Republican lawmakers two days  after signing the actions, he took a more strident tone toward  the industry.', '  “If people want to build pipelines on our land, we want the pipe  to be ... manufactured here,” he said.', '  “You will see a level of quality that you’re not going to see  when they bring the pipe from far distances, have to bring it in  small chunks and then fabricate it on the land,” he continued.  “Give me a break. We can do much better than that, and we’re  going to do it much better, and it’s going to end up costing less  money. Believe me.”', '  He also suggested one or both of the companies had planned on  procuring materials for the projects from unnamed markets —  “and I won’t tell you where, but you wouldn’t be happy” — an  apparent reference to overseas pipe or steel makers.', '  A spokesperson for the Association of Oil Pipe Lines said pipeline pipes, pumps and valves assembled in the United States  typically contain both U.S. and foreign parts. He said the  association has focused on ensuring manufacturers procure  materials that meet quality and safety requirements.', '  “We are collecting information from our suppliers for this  additional focus on production location. We look forward to  providing input and comments to the Department of Commerce as  they develop their plan over the next 6 months per the  President’s memorandum,” John Stoody, vice president of  government and public relations said in an email.', '  The president’s pursuit of the issue is a somewhat  counterintuitive move, given his calls to boost U.S. oil  and gas production and launch a massive infrastructure  plan. He may be betting he can achieve these aims in tandem with  his cornerstone vow to return manufacturing jobs to the United  States.', '  The made-in-America requirement brought sharp criticisms from  free market advocates, who said it could spark retaliation by  trade partners and make the United States less prosperous. At the  same time, they noted that the wording of the memo suggests Trump  does not intend to follow through, and the executive action  essentially amounts to lip service to his base.', '  Such a policy would violate a bedrock of international trade  deals called national interest, trade experts say. The principle  says a government cannot treat foreign companies any differently  than domestic companies. ', '  There is no precedent for a U.S. president requiring private  companies to use U.S.-made materials or equipment outside of  war-time, said Dan Ikenson, director of the Cato Institute’s  Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies.', '  “First of all, this is private investment, so there’s no legal  authority for the government to require a private company to use  domestic materials,” he said on Thursday, prior to Trump’s  comments at the retreat.', '  “Is it good policy to have the president dictate where U.S.  companies buy their inputs? No. I think that’s terrible. I think  that’s dictatorial. I think it’s very bad precedence.”', '  The steel sector is among a number of hard-hit industries Trump  has vowed to revive, but the policy could create a host of  unintended consequences. ', '  In general, mandating that an industry use products from one  country raises the cost of every project by limiting the supply,  gives monopoly power to domestic producers and allows suppliers  to abandon the pricing discipline that competition creates,  according to Ikenson.', '  Such a policy would draw retaliation from trade partners and  shrink U.S. exports considerably, he said. ', '  “The President and his team are committed to creating economic  development and jobs for the great people of our country. At the  core of this mission is a ‘buy American and hire American’  philosophy,” White House Director of Strategic Communications  Hope Hicks said in an email.', '  David Henderson, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution and  former economic advisor to President Ronald Reagan, said the  policy would be “a bad idea.”', '  “It is a barrier to trade, and barriers to trade make both sides  worse off,” he said. All things equal, it would make Americans  less wealthy, he added.', 'Henderson and others point out a key phrase in the  memorandum: that pipeline builders use U.S. products “to the  maximum extent possible and to the extent permitted by  law.”', '  Trade treaties have force of law under the Constitution, and so  by including that phrase, there is no contradiction with the law,  Henderson said. But it also means the executive action is  toothless.', '  “My guess is he’s making it toothless on purpose so he looks good  to his constituents without doing so much harm,” he said.', '  Following Trump’s comments on Thursday, Ikenson said in an email, “The fine  print, which only a few inside-the-beltway types will notice,  says: We’re looking into whether it would be legal for the  government to require steel used in private pipeline projects be  American-made. Trump’s handlers can dismiss as semantics.”', '  It is very likely that Calgary-based TransCanada would have used  U.S. and Canadian pipes, because the United States has imposed  tariffs on imports to prevent a number of countries from  dumping low-cost supplies, Ikenson said. That has narrowed the cost difference with foreign pipes and may even make imports more expensive to use, he added.', '  However, on Thursday, Trump suggested that was not the case. He  also took responsibility for coming up with the idea of imposing  U.S.-made steel on the projects.', '  “I say, let’s put that little clause in, like it’s a one-sentence  clause, but that clause is going to attract a lot of people, and  we’re going to make that pipe right here in America, OK?” he  said.', '  In 2012, TransCanada said 50 percent of the pipes used to build  the project would come from a plant in Little Rock, Arkansas  operated by Indian conglomerate Welspun. The remaining pipe would  be made in Canada, Italy and India.', '  A spokesperson for TransCanada noted that the press release containing the information is five years old. He declined to comment on whether the plan had changed or on the president’s remarks at the retreat. ', '  “We note that the Secretary of Commerce will come up with a plan  to implement the [executive order]. We will need time to review  and analyze the plan when it is released to determine its impact  to” the Keystone XL pipeline, Terry Cunha, senior manager for media and communications at TransCanada said in a statement.', '  Steel tariffs have sent prices rising for U.S. manufacturers,  with U.S. hot-rolled coil steel prices jumping 61.9 percent last  year, FactSet data shows.', '  Energy analysts say the cost of making pipeline builders procure  American steel and pipes is unlikely to hurt their profits or  ripple through the industry and get passed on to consumers.', '  The real question is whether the U.S. steel industry has the  capacity to supply every pipeline project in the United States,  said Libby Toudouze, portfolio manager at Cushing Asset  Management.', '  “Let’s say in 2017, 2018 we need 300 miles of pipeline and the  U.S. steel companies’ maximum capacity could crank out 100 miles  of pipe. It’s not reasonable for us to hold up the 200 miles of  pipeline because the U.S. guys can’t scale to get there,” she  said.', '  The ultimate goal of the memorandum is not so much to make sure  the rule is in place, but to move forward Trump’s plan to create  more U.S. manufacturing, she said. In that light, she said, Trump  was essentially sending TransCanada a message: Strongly consider  doing it our way because if you don’t, we can certainly make it  difficult for you.', '  “His constituents see that he’s going to bat for them. Whether  U.S. materials are ultimately used won’t be known to most people  who he’s appealing to with this rhetoric,” Ikenson said.']"

The plan is the result of a study Trump ordered in one of several presidential memos he signed during his first week in office.', 'The Commerce Department told CNBC it expects to deliver the plan on time. But while the idea attracted some support from steel makers during a public comment period, it also drew many warnings from industry groups, pipe manufacturers, energy companies and foreign governments.', '“With global trade topping $20 trillion annually, the proliferation of such protectionist measures would only serve to jeopardize the ability of U.S. companies and their workers to sell goods and services to the 95 percent of the world’s consumers who live outside our borders,” the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said.', 'That tees up a potentially awkward roll out. Early in his presidency, Trump evoked the plan often and with great enthusiasm. He has repeatedly said the idea came to him in a moment of inspiration while he was reviewing planned memos authorizing two controversial pipeline projects.', 'Even before Ross began collecting input from stakeholders, Trump was floating his vision in public.', 'In his view, not only should pipeline builders use domestically manufactured pipes, but pipe makers should only buy raw steel from American mills. He suggested he’d enforce the mandate by refusing to exercise the government’s power to appropriate private land on behalf of pipeline companies if they didn’t buy American.', 'Some of the nation’s top trading partners — the European Union, Canada, Mexico and Australia — raised concerns, including that the mandate would violate bedrock principles of free trade agreements and encourage other countries to protect their own manufacturing sectors with similar requirements.', 'The European Union reminded the Commerce Department that the United States and EU had partnered in the past to dissuade countries like China, India and Russia from implementing similar domestic manufacturing requirements.', 'Canada and Mexico both called the policy an “unprecedented intrusion” into companies’ decision-making and noted that the North American steel industry is deeply interwoven. Canada said the executive action had created uncertainty and already delayed construction and hiring on both sides of the border.', 'Many pipe makers and the trade groups that represent them warned that the requirement could increase costs, disrupt supply chains, delay projects and restrict hiring. In dozens of pages of comments, industry associations argued that the mandate is largely unworkable without a lengthy phase-in period and substantial loopholes.', '“Higher pipe prices from a domestic content requirement would threaten new pipeline projects and hurt creation of new U.S. jobs building pipelines. We want to ensure that any action to help Buy America does not hurt Hire America,” John Stoody, vice president of government and public relations at the Association of Oil Pipe Lines, told CNBC this week.', 'National Fuel, a Williamsville, New York-based energy and utility company, warned that the requirement could cause big companies to place large orders for pipes and raw steel in anticipation of a shortage, sending prices higher. It suggested creating incentives, rather than a requirement, to use American products.', 'The Commerce Department told CNBC it declines “to comment on any issues or legal analysis until the report is issued.”', 'Among the strongest supporters were U.S.-based steel companies like Nucor. Many noted that while they do not currently make some of the products pipeline makers use, they have the capacity to start supplying them in coming years.', 'Still, some steel makers stopped short of a full-throated endorsement of Trump’s plan, instead expressing support for policies that encourage — not require — sourcing steel from North America. That is perhaps because many steel makers have operations across borders.', 'As Canada pointed out: “Many steel facilities operating in both countries are subsidiaries of the same parent companies, including ArcelorMittal, Tenaris, Evraz, Harris Steel and others. In addition, most of our steelworkers are represented by the same union, the United Steelworkers.”', 'The president has lately been less vocal about the plan, perhaps because he has been embroiled in Republican infighting over health-care reform, backlash over his firing of FBI Director James Comey and new revelations about his campaign’s contacts with Russia-linked individuals.', 'Trump invoked the deal as recently as last month, but the administration has already carved out one big exception.', 'The White House conceded in March that TransCanada would not have to use American-made pipes and steel in its proposed Keystone XL pipeline. That is one of the two pipelines Trump was considering when he ostensibly came up with the Made in America requirement.']"

Mr. Trump pledged to build roads and bridges, strengthen “Buy America” provisions, protect factories from unfair imports and revive industry, especially steel.', 'But after a year in office, Mr. Trump has not enacted these policies. And when it comes to steel, his failure to follow through on a promise has actually done more harm than good.', 'Foreign steel makers have rushed to get their product into the United States before tariffs start. According to the American Iron and Steel Institute, which tracks shipments, steel imports were 19.4 percent higher in the first 10 months of 2017 than in the same period last year.', 'That surge of imports has hurt American steel makers, which were already struggling against a glut of cheap Chinese steel. When ArcelorMittal announced the layoffs in Conshohocken, it blamed those imports, as well as low demand for steel for bridges and military equipment.', 'James Rockas, a spokesman for the Commerce Department, said the administration was “aware of the plight of American steel workers and will continue working to halt unfair trade practices that harm our economy and kill American jobs.”', 'In 2008, before the financial crisis struck, the plant ran around the clock.

Automakers, food processors and companies in other industries that use steel and aluminum in their products complained that tariffs would drive up costs and make them less competitive, ultimately sacrificing more American jobs than they would save. Steel exporters, like the European Union, threatened retaliation. Prominent economists highlighted the risk of a trade war.', '“I think the White House is immobilized, because they have such a cacophony of voices,” said Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio who describes himself as an ally of the president on trade. “This administration doesn’t seem to know what it thinks about trade.”', 'The administration will face a series of deadlines on the steel measure next year.
