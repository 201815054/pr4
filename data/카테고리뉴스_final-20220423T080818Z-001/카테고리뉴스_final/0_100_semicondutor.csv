The company announced in April that it would invest $100 billion over the next three years to increase factory capacity.', 'Murphy said the shortage may be addressed as the demand for certain chip-using products finally falls.', '“I think there’s no way, from my point of view, that every segment of the electronics industry stays up and to the right, ripping demand for another 12 months; it doesn’t make any sense,” Murphy said. “I think something’s got to give. And when it gives that should free up the capacity in aggregate for the rest of the industry to go consume and ultimately align it with the true demand.”', 'Slowing of demand could come from areas such as the personal computer market, Murphy said, citing Micron Technology’s lower-than-expected sales guidance for its upcoming quarter.', 'Micron Technology CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said on CNBC’s “Mad Money” on Wednesday that while PC end user demand is strong, “some of the PC customers are not able to fulfill their demand because they’re not getting sufficient all components that are needed to build the PCs.”', 'More than 300 million personal computers were sold in 2020, according to market intelligence firm IDC, up from 268 million in 2019.', 'That led some analysts to project upwards of 400 million PC sales in the coming years, but it is a sales trajectory which Murphy expressed doubts about during the CNBC TEC event.', 'Eventually, Murphy said he expects there to be “massive pockets of over inventory when this is all done.”', '“If you look at how many masks or hand sanitizers or toilet paper that is flowing around, there was a panic, and there’s a panic buy on semiconductors right now,” he said. “At some point, you order an order and it goes the other way.”', 'Any chip inventory relief would be welcomed by the automotive industry, which has perhaps been the hardest hit by the lack of semiconductors.', 'General Motors said Friday that U.S. vehicle sales during the third quarter fell by more than 30% year-over-year as the chip shortage interrupted production and reduced available inventory at dealerships.', 'Last month, the automaker shut down production at most of its North American plants again as it dealt with a lack of semiconductor chips. That short supply has forced General Motors to shift its available chips to only its most popular and profitable vehicles, such as pickup trucks.', 'Overall, U.S. auto sales are expected to drop at least 13% in the third quarter due to disrupted production tied back to the chip shortage, according to industry estimates.', 'Still, several automakers suggested those issues could be absolved soon.', '“The semiconductor supply disruptions that impacted our third-quarter wholesale and customer deliveries are improving,” Steve Carlisle, GM president of North America, said in a statement. “As we look to the fourth quarter, a steady flow of vehicles held at plants will continue to be released to dealers, we are restarting production at key crossover and car plants, and we look forward to a more stable operating environment through the fall.”', 'Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently called the semiconductor chip shortage a “short-term” problem, saying that “there’s a lot of chip fabrication plants that are being built and I think we will have good capacity by next year.”', 'Murphy said the shortage of semiconductors has shifted some of the thinking as it relates to the supply chain.', '“Even before the pandemic hit there was tightening that was going on,” he said. “The chip companies actually have to take a different view now of supply entry, it’s a strategic imperative in terms of how you plan your capacity, your relationships with your suppliers.”', 'There is more willingness from buyers to pay for capacity in advance or to sign up for take-or-pay agreements, which would mean the company would take the product from the supplier or pay a penalty, Murphy said.', '“We’re viewing this as a strategic shift to capacity being strategic, not just an afterthought,” he said.']"

GlobalFoundries’ clients include Qualcomm, MediaTek, NXP Semiconductors and Qorvo.', 'Automotive companies and home appliance makers have been struggling for months to obtain enough chips for building products, and now the problem is spreading to electronics manufacturers and their suppliers. Apple, for example, said it will miss out on more than $6 billion in sales this holiday season because of chip shortages. Intel likewise blamed its lower CPU sales on shortages in power supply and networking chips.', 'But the shortages aren’t for the most advanced chips that use the latest manufacturing methods. Instead, the shortages are for what are often called “legacy nodes,” or semiconductors that use older technology to perform functions like power management, connecting to displays or enabling wireless connections.', 'Those are the kinds of chips that GlobalFoundries, a third-party silicon-wafer foundry, specializes in manufacturing for its clients, Caulfield explained.', '“That’s where the bigger part of the shortage is, because there’s been underinvestment in that,” Caulfield said. “For me, we’re happy to let the bigger companies kind of serve that single-digit nanometer market, and we will be the very best in our differentiated technology.”', 'Profitability in the foundry business is linked to utilization, or the rate that the foundry’s factories are running around the clock. GlobalFoundries had a utilization rate of 84% in 2020, but Caulfield said that was related to slowdowns at the start of the pandemic.', '“I would say, since August of 2020, we can’t make enough. Every day, we try to squeeze out as much as we can. I would say we’re over 100%,” Caulfield said, adding that the company’s wafer capacity was sold out through the end of 2023.', 'Caulfield said that GlobalFoundries made a strategic decision in 2018 to stop developing the bleeding edge chip manufacturing technologies foundries like TSMC and Samsung are investing in, and instead focus on less advanced but still-essential semiconductors for its clients.', 'Foundries have low-margin business models and face high labor, equipment and raw materials costs. In its prospectus, GlobalFoundries said it recorded a gross margin of close to 11% in the first half of 2021.', 'Of the $2.6 billion GlobalFoundries raised on the public markets, $1.5 billion will be spent on capital expenditures to increase capacity to fill demand, Caulfield said. It operates plants in the U.S., Germany and Singapore.', 'GlobalFoundries stock closed 1.3% lower on Thursday, under its debut price of $47, before rising over 5% on Friday to close at $48.74.', 'The company is still over 85% owned by Mubadala, the United Arab Emirates state investment fund. Mubadala took control of the company when AMD spun off its manufacturing arm, which became GlobalFoundries, and focused on chip design in 2008.', 'Caulfield said that Mubadala will reduce its ownership stake in GlobalFoundries in the coming years but will still continue to support the manufacturer.', '“Over the next, call it five to six years, in a very orderly and transparent way, [Mubadala will] take some of their ownership out to get more balanced,” Caulfield said.']"

But most Americans still want the same things — opportunity and a chance to leave a better life for their children. By revitalizing American manufacturing and production, we take steps to renew our nation’s promise of economic opportunity by spreading good paying jobs across the whole country.', 'The digital sector is reshaping our economy. But by providing digital services in a few select cities in the U.S., and outsourcing production to our foreign competitors, it has excluded too many American workers in the process, and sent innovation and growth to other countries.', 'High wage opportunities are concentrated in too few places.

Now, Intel plans to harness the best of what both our constituencies have to offer by building a massive new computer chip manufacturing center in central Ohio. Semiconductor chips will drive innovation in manufacturing for years to come as we produce more and more high-tech goods, and Intel is committing to making them here in America.', 'For Ohioans, these factories are predicted to create around 10,000 new manufacturing jobs, and tens of thousands more jobs will be created with suppliers around the state. Union tradespeople will build the facilities. And it’s not just Ohioans who will benefit. Spreading opportunities across the country will help shorten supply chains, driving down costs. Michigan auto factories in Warren, Detroit and Fort Wayne will be able to get semiconductors made in one state — not one hemisphere – away. We must ensure this is the start of a technology and manufacturing boom in America’s heartland that will create a ladder of opportunity for all workers.', 'But we can’t sit back and assume this will happen on its own.', 'For starters, Congress must send a competitiveness bill, which includes the CHIPS Act, short for Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act, to the president’s desk.

American manufacturers shouldn’t have to rely on foreign producers when we can make them right here in America. When companies are no longer forced to rely on long semiconductor supply chains that stretch across the globe, Americans frustrated by long wait times for products will get their high-tech goods faster.', 'The CHIPS Act is just one piece of a much larger legislative package we’re working to pass to make bold investments in research, development, and manufacturing of critical technology. It would ensure new research investments translate into increased manufacturing and high-tech jobs in American industries, and ensure we continue to set technology standards around the world in a the 21st-century economy.', 'It will create regional innovation hubs across the country, in every region. There’s no reason jobs  in the digital sector should only exist in places like Silicon Valley, Austin, Boston, or New York. We can strengthen manufacturing ecosystems in places like Dayton, Milwaukee, and Pittsburgh.  ', 'No one should have to choose between the hometown they love and a good-paying job in the 21st century economy.

Many, like GlobalFoundries, are investing billions in new production lines and upgraded equipment to keep up with the surge in demand and shortfalls in supply.', 'GlobalFoundries is the largest U.S.-headquartered “pure” foundry, with factories in the U.S., Germany and Singapore. It manufactures semiconductors designed by companies like AMD, Qualcomm and Broadcom. It’s currently a private company owned by the government of Abu Dhabi. The company is considering an IPO in the first half of 2022 or sooner, Caulfield said.', 'GlobalFoundries is still a relatively small player, with only a 7% share of the foundry market according to Trendforce. Other foundries are investing big dollars too.', 'Taiwan-based TSMC, the biggest company in the space with a 54% market share, said on Thursday it plans to invest $100 billion over the next three years to increase its capacity to meet demand.', 'Intel, which designs and manufactures its chips, announced on March 23 it plans to become a foundry and manufacture chips for other companies. It’s investing $20 billion U.S. chipmaking plants.', 'Caulfield said he welcomes Intel’s shift and doesn’t see the company as a new competitor. One key difference is Intel is skilled at “bleeding edge” manufacturing or making chips with the smallest and most dense transistors, which are required for powerful CPU chips at the heart of a computer or smartphone.', 'But Caulfield says the industry shortages, specifically for the automotive world, aren’t because of demand for leading node chips. The shortages are for other parts cars need, like radar chips, which don’t necessarily require the most advanced manufacturing available at the time.', '“The auto industry is not having a chip shortage because it doesn’t have CPUs. No one’s saying I can’t build enough computers, it’s all the other chips,” Caulfield said.', 'Chips that are designed to enable specific features are what GlobalFoundries specializes in.', 'GlobalFoundries manufactures secure chips for contactless payments, battery power management and touch display drivers. These chips first were used in large quantities for smartphones, but are now included in a wide range of products from cars to appliances, which has created a surge in demand.', 'However, most of the investments in the foundry world have been for building bleeding-edge, high-speed chips. That all changed last year when the pandemic hit, and sales of electronics including laptops, monitors, and game consoles rose when people bought equipment to work or go to school from home.', 'Those products require a lot of additional chips beyond the CPU, seeding the start of the chip shortage and highlighting the need for more capacity to build what Caulfield calls “feature-rich” chips. Smartphones and computers also increasingly need non-leading node chips to connect to 5G networks or add additional cameras.', 'GlobalFoundries warned it will take months before it can increase the number of chips on the market, but that the capacity boost makes sense for long-term investments. “The minute you say, I want to make more capacity, it’s a 12-month cycle,” Caulfield said.', '“The semi industry going into Covid was projecting a 5% annual growth rate for five years. We’re projecting that to almost double now,” Caulfield said. “It’s not a one-time thing. It’s a structural shift, that the pervasive need for semiconductors is accelerating.”']"

That demand for products requiring advanced semiconductors has led to shortages in other industries like automobiles.', 'Chips are made by companies known as foundries which do the actual manufacturing. The two leading ones are Taiwan’s TSMC as well as South Korean technology giant Samsung. That means there are very few companies able to make leading edge semiconductors.', 'But not all products, in particular in the auto industry, require the most cutting-edge chips. In fact, they need a lot of semiconductors built on older technology which is where China’s SMIC could step in.', 'SMIC is China’s largest contract semiconductor manufacturer. It makes chips that other companies design.', 'But its technology is far behind the likes of TSMC and Samsung and it is not able to manufacture the most cutting-edge components.', 'SMIC is China’s best bet at creating a rival to TSMC and Samsung and is key part of the country’s ambitions to boost its domestic industry and bring some self-reliance in semiconductors.', 'In December, the U.S. government added SMIC to an export blacklist called the Entity List. That restricts American firms for exporting technology to SMIC, a move which could hurt the Chinese firm’s ability to manufacture the most advanced chips.', 'The semiconductor supply chain and manufacturing process is complex. While TSMC, Samsung and SMIC manufacture chips, they rely on software and machinery from U.S. and European firms to do so. If SMIC can’t access those tools, it becomes incredibly hard for it to catch up to rivals.', 'For now, SMIC is able to produce semiconductors based on older technology. And that could work to its advantage because cars and other products don’t require cutting-edge chips at the moment.', '“Autos are not demanding a lot of leading edge chips. A lot are still on peripheral chips ... built on legacy nodes,” Sze Ho Ng, analyst at China Renaissance said.', 'These include chips used for power management to regulate the battery use of a device, for example.', 'Node refers to a semiconductor manufacturing process. The most advanced is called a 5 nanometer process. But SMIC cannot produce these kinds of chips. Instead, the company is looking at 28 nanometers and above, which are much older technologies, but are good enough for many industries beyond consumer electronics.', 'Ng said that SMIC has also been raising prices for its customers which should benefit the firm. Last month, SMIC said its revenue target for 2021 is “mid-to-high single digit percentage growth.” Ng said he sees “upside” to that.', 'The analyst has a “buy” rating and a 43 Hong Kong dollar price target on shares of SMIC listed in the city.

While saddled with the burden of previous trade policies, the U.S. needs an answer that can correct the short-term, supply-demand imbalance. Building $20 billion chip factories — or fabs — over the course of five years is a long-term solution to a near-term, crushing dilemma.', 'The automotive industry is feeling the strain the most. However, it is worth noting that a lack of supply chain strategy, a forecasting of raw material shortages even outside of the pandemic, and sheer risk management could have helped mitigate this global crisis. Keep in mind also that while cars are moving toward becoming electronics themselves, the chip technologies that exist today make it possible for them to be functional and capable.  ', 'The manufacturing industry needs to quickly take note that what has been hyped as a necessity due to Moore’s law — 5 nanometer nodes — is false 90% of the time. Building a $20 billion fab is simply expensive (though companies with near-monopoly status, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., would be served well by this approach.) TSMC admittedly cannot keep up with the industry’s applications. Car companies and the majority of electronics companies that have technologies that are sub-micron, but larger than 10 nanometer nodes, are enough. And with clever design and iterative artificial intelligence approaches, the process will be less expensive and produced in a significantly shorter timeframe.', 'Using the legacy equipment from the last 20 years to make products that the manufacturing industry needs now can be accomplished more efficiently through the utilization of intelligent control that is possible with AI.
