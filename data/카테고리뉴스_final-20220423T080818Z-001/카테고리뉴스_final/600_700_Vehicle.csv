Before the end of the decade, Ghosn said, the company will  introduce vehicles that can negotiate city crossroads without  driver intervention.', '  Nissan is already making strides in autonomous technologies,  with prototype Leaf electric vehicles that are outfitted with an  array of cameras, radar, lasers and sonar sensors. Nissan is also  equipping some of its products with basic technologies that will  eventually be part of a fully autonomous car.', '  One example is the steer-by-wire system on the new Infiniti Q50,  which eliminates the traditional, mechanical link between the  steering wheel and the tires. (There is a backup system  in case the sedan loses power, though the vehicle last year was subject to a recall linked to the system.)', '  While there are plenty of skeptics who question the potential for  autonomous vehicles, Navigant’s study suggests the technology  will become the dominant form of automotive  transportation down the road.

The  technology also will prove critical if makers hope to meet  Europe’s increasingly stringent restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions—a tough challenge for high-end makers such as Mercedes-Benz, which will unveil a new plug-in version of its  big S-Class sedan at the show.', '  The range of battery-based offerings will be “all over the  map,” said Stephanie Brinley, an industry analyst with IHS  Automotive—from the compact Volkswagen e-Golf to Land Rover’s plug-in diesel hybrid for its  flagship Range Rover SUV.', '  Nonetheless, Brinley is among the many skeptics who question how  much impact battery technology will have in Europe, where,  despite sky-high fuel prices, electric propulsion has gained about as much traction as it has in the U.S.—less than 4 percent  of the total market.', '  (More from The Detroit Bureau: Honda Accord hits 50—MPG, that is)', '  Price has been a barrier, as battery-based vehicles typically  start at several thousand dollars above conventional gasoline  systems. The gap is narrower when it comes to an alternative,  high-mileage technology—but unlike American drivers,  Europeans have fallen in love with diesel.', '  Equipped with turbochargers and high-pressure fuel injection  systems, today’s diesels are quiet, clean and surprisingly peppy,  while delivering near-hybrid highway mileage—factors that  have helped so-called “oil-burners” garner roughly half of the  European market.', '  (More from The Detroit  Bureau: US Car Sales Boom Likely to Keep Building)', '  The Range Rover hybrid coming to Frankfurt is meant to deliver  the best of both technologies, pairing a 288-horsepower  turbodiesel with a 47-horsepower electric motor. While the system  can launch the huge SUV from 0 to 100 kmh (62.5 mph) in just 6.9  seconds, it also is expected to yield 44.1 mpg—roughly  approximate to the Toyota Prius of  a few years back.', '  “We are extremely excited,” said John Edwards, Land Rover’s  global brand director. “The addition of a smooth electric drive  enhances refinement, cuts CO2 emissions and  delivers staggering performance,” he said.', '  Combining the words “performance” and “hybrid” might seem  oxymoronic for those familiar with the battery-based vehicles  that have dominated the market in recent years. Models such as  the Prius and the Nissan Leaf have  put a premium on energy efficiency, at the expense of spirited  acceleration.', '  Electric motors generate their maximum, tire-smoking torque when  they begin to spin. It’s a matter of picking the right batteries  and motors.', '  (More from The Detroit  Bureau: Car market winners and losers—and how to snag a  deal) ', '  That’s important for manufacturers for which quick  takeoff is as important as leather seats and high-end audio  systems. Manufacturers such as Porsche can’t afford to alienate  their customer base as they stare into the face of restrictive European Union CO2 standards that could  otherwise force them to produce “stone ponies.”', '  One of the most significant introductions coming to  Frankfurt—from a battery-based performance standpoint,  anyway—is the Porsche 918. The carbon-fiber plug-in hybrid  is rated at 78 mpg and will get about 18 miles per charge on its  lithium-ion battery pack, but it will also launch from 0 to 60 in  less than 2.8 seconds. A Chevrolet Volt it is not. Especially at  $845,000.', '  But Frankfurt’s battery fix won’t be limited to the moneyed  class. Brands will target those who actually have to worry about  the cost of fuel. There will be two pure battery-electric  offerings from Volkswagen, which owns Porsche and Audi, the  latter which will be introducing a 700-horsepower performance  hybrid.', '  (Read more: Auto profits to surge, over half coming from China)', '  For more mainstream markets, VW will be unveiling the e-Up (an  all-electric version of its microcar) and a battery-electric  e-Golf. They are expected to cut fuel costs by as much as  two-thirds versus the same models equipped with a midrange  gasoline engine.', '  “We’re seeing a natural progression of battery technology as it’s  applied to a wider spectrum of products,” Brinley said.', '  Whether that will bring buyers into showrooms in a seriously  distressed car market remains to be seen, but manufacturers are  clearly plugging into battery power and hoping European motorists  will get charged up, too.', '  —By CNBC Contributor Paul A.
