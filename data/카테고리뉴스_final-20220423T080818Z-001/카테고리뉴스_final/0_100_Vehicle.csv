As the cell is discharged, the ions move back to the cathode, releasing energy.', 'In recent years, automakers have discovered that adding more nickel to the cathode can boost a battery’s energy density, which translates into more range per pound of batteries.', 'Older lithium-ion batteries used cathodes that were about one-third nickel. But in recent years, automakers have increased the percentage of nickel in cathodes to boost the batteries’ energy density and increase vehicle range. Most are now using cathodes that contain at least 60% nickel.', 'Some use even more, in part to reduce or eliminate cobalt, and in part to increase density for premium applications: The cathodes in cells that Korean battery giant LG Chem supplies to Tesla are 90% nickel, for instance.', 'High-nickel batteries offer significant advantages for electric vehicles. But even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, nickel wasn’t cheap, and experts were raising concerns about a likely shortage as global automakers ramped up production of EVs.', 'Analysts at Rystad Energy warned last fall that global demand for the high-grade nickel required for EV batteries is likely to outstrip supply by 2024, a message that has since been echoed by other commodity analysts, including Jonas’s counterparts at Morgan Stanley.', 'Given the relatively high cost of nickel, and the concerns about supply that were being voiced before Russia invaded Ukraine, automakers have signaled that lithium-ion batteries with high-nickel cathodes are likely to be limited to premium applications. In those, the energy density is either required (as with heavy trucks) or a key selling point (as with luxury sedans).', 'Assuming that nickel’s price increase is sustained, the quick and obvious takeaway is that electric-vehicle costs will go up — and more so for higher-end EVs.', 'Automakers who haven’t locked in a supply of nickel at pre-invasion prices will have a hard choice. They can choose to absorb the cost increase, reducing their profit margins, or they can try to pass it on to consumers. Most will likely do some of both.', 'Not all EVs will be affected. There is an alternative type of battery that’s already in use for lower-cost EVs, although it comes with tradeoffs. Lithium iron phosphate, or LFP, batteries use iron phosphate in their cathodes, no nickel or cobalt required.', 'LFP cells cost less than lithium-ion cells, but they also have lower energy density, which means that LFP battery packs are heavier per mile of range than their lithium-ion counterparts. That weight has made LFP batteries less than ideal for higher-end vehicles, as added weight limits performance and can hinder a vehicle’s handling. That’s less of a concern with price-constrained mass-market models. Chinese automakers, under government pressure to encourage EV adoption, have used LFP batteries in their lower-cost electric vehicles for several years.', 'LFP technology received a visibility boost in the U.S. when Tesla began using LFP batteries in its entry-level “standard range” models last fall. At the time, the move to LFP was seen as a way for Tesla to lower the cost of producing those models — or put another way, to increase the profitability of those entry-level vehicles without increasing prices.', 'Now, with nickel prices skyrocketing, we may — once again — see major global automakers following Tesla’s lead.']"

It’s just going to be really dependent on obviously how long this goes on,” said Jeff Schuster, president of global forecasting and the Americas at LMC Automotive. “The sanctions and trade impact play a big role in that.”', 'The invasion is already creating new supply problems for parts such as wire harnesses, which act as a vehicle’s wiring system. The war is also expected to further escalate existing supply limitations of parts such as catalytic converters and semiconductor chips that use materials and gases from the region. The crisis could worsen rising inflation and propel already record-high vehicle prices even higher.', '“This does have global implications in terms of adding to inflationary pressure, pricing pressure and ultimately dealing another blow to the consumer,” Schuster said.', 'For U.S. consumers, the most immediate impact is higher gas prices. The national average for a gallon of gas hit $4.009 on Sunday, according to AAA — the highest since July 2008, not adjusted for inflation.', 'Early forecasts for the reduction in vehicle output resulting from the conflict vary greatly given the fluidity of the situation.', 'Schuster said the impact could amount to millions of units of production in 2022. His firm has already adjusted its forecast to cut 700,000 units of European production, he said.', 'The European auto market will feel the effects far more quickly than the U.S. and other markets. European automakers such as Audi and Mercedes-Benz have said they plan to cut production output at plants due to parts disruptions out of Ukraine — specifically, wire harnesses.', '“Wire harnesses are the most critical near-term bottleneck, in our view, already causing significant production interruption amongst all German OEMs,” UBS analyst Patrick Hummel said Monday in an investor note. “We think significant downtimes in the next few weeks are likely, but limited to European production because wire harnesses are typically sourced regionally.”', 'AutoForecast Solutions expects vehicle production this year in Russia and Ukraine to get cut in half as a result of the conflict, falling to around 800,000 units.', 'An early “pessimistic outlook” from research firm IHS Markit expects the global impact this year to be about 3.5 million fewer vehicles in connection with semiconductor chip constraints.

Revenue jumped 12.4% year over year to 111.24 billion euros, or about $122.4 billion.', 'Both profit and revenue notched records for the company.', 'The increase in BMW ’s annual revenue was driven the old-fashioned way: by increased sales of cars, SUVs and motorcycles. The automaker’s vehicle deliveries, including cars and SUVs, rose 8.4% from its coronavirus-challenged 2020 result, to just over 2.5 million vehicles. That came despite production disruptions related to an ongoing global shortage of semiconductor chips.', 'About 13% of those 2021 deliveries were “electrified” vehicles, meaning plug-in hybrids or fully electric models. Sales of BMW Group’s electrified vehicles were just over 328,000 in 2021, up 70% from the company’s 2020 result, but still well short of EV leader Tesla’s 936,000 2021 total.', 'BMW is aiming to have fully electric vehicles account for at least half of its global deliveries by 2030.', 'The EV push is coming at a cost. BMW’s research and development spending, much of which was focused on new EV architectures and components, rose 10.7% to 6.3 billion euros. But it remained roughly consistent with 2020 when expressed as a percentage of revenue, about 6.2%.', 'BMW’s profitability also surged as the company prioritized production of its most profitable vehicle lines amid the chip shortage, a good sign for investors hoping that the company will be able to comfortably finance its transition to zero-emissions vehicles. The operating profit margin in BMW’s automotive segment, a widely watched figure among auto analysts, rose to a healthy 10.3% in 2021 from just 2.7% in 2020 and 4.9% in 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic roiled global industries.', 'Sales of BMW motorcycles rose 14.8% in 2021, to just over 194,000.

19,How a global nickel shortage could disrupt the electric vehicle industry ,2022-03-19T13:00:01+0000,"['As automakers around the world set bold targets for vehicle electrification, many in the industry are looking to nickel — an integral component of most lithium ion batteries — as a major hurdle.', 'While there’s enough nickel in the ground to support a major EV ramp up, there are not enough planned mining projects or processing facilities to make the type of high-grade nickel that’s needed for EV batteries.', 'Meanwhile, the nickel content in battery cells is only increasing, according to Mark Beveridge at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. That’s because more nickel means energy density.', '″We’re heading towards, you know, 90 percent of the cathode being nickel for certain specific cell types,” Beveridge said.', 'Russia has a lot of high-grade nickel, and its invasion of Ukraine has sent prices soaring to record highs due to fears of supply disruptions, even causing the London Metal Exchange to suspend nickel trading for a week.', 'Meanwhile, the U.S. is short on domestic nickel resources. The Eagle Mine in Michigan is the nation’s only primary nickel mine, and it’s expected to close in 2025.', 'Enter the proposed Tamarack Mine in Minnesota, which is being developed by Talon Metals and mining giant Rio Tinto. Although it’s yet to go through the permitting process, Talon has already secured a supply deal with Tesla to get Tamarack nickel into EV batteries.', 'Elsewhere though, the project pipeline for new, high-grade nickel mines has largely dried up, and communities often push back against proposals for new mining projects.', 'The Tamarack mine is no exception.', 'Paula Maccabee, a Minnesota lawyer serving as the Advocacy Director and Counsel for the nonprofit WaterLegacy, has questions. “How much nickel will be getting into our drinking water? Where will that toxic nickel go when an underground mine has gaps and fissures?”', 'Currently, the majority of the world’s nickel is used in the stainless steel industry. Beveridge estimates that batteries make up slightly more than 10% of total demand, though that balance is expected to shift rapidly in the coming decades. ', '″If we go forward 10 to 15 years, we’re actually looking to a future where the battery sector could provide more than 50 percent of the demand for nickel units by that time.”', 'But not all nickel is high quality enough for use in EV batteries — it needs to be so-called “class one” nickel, with at least 99.8% purity. No nickel is this pure naturally; it all needs to be refined. But the higher the grade of the original nickel deposit, the easier and less energy it takes to process it.', 'The site of the proposed Tamarack mine is a high-grade nickel sulfide deposit.', '“You know, some of our grades we’ve seen up to 12 percent nickel, which globally is very high. That’s some of the highest grades I’ve ever seen in my career, ” said Brian Goldner, Chief Exploration and Operations Officer at Talon.', 'Nickel sulfides are typically found deep within the earth, and are extracted via underground mines. Currently, the U.S. sources most of its nickel sulfides from Canada, Norway, Australia, and Finland, but there are very few new sulfide mines in the works.', 'Additional nickel could come from laterite, a lower-quality but more prevalent type of nickel ore that’s found near the earth’s surface and extracted via open-pit mining. Indonesia and the Philippines mine the most laterites, while Australia and Brazil also have large reserves. ', 'The problem is that upgrading low-grade nickel laterites for use in EV batteries involves extremely energy-intensive processes, such as high pressure acid leaching, in which laterite ore is heated to an extremely high temperature, mixed with sulfuric acid, and pressurized. ', '“The CO2 footprint would be in the order of about 15 to 20 times more than what we can do with a deposit like what you have at the Tamarack project, ” said Henri van Rooyen, CEO of Talon Metals.', 'That’s one reason why many in the EV industry believe it’s important to develop new nickel sulfide mines, particularly in the U.S. and allied countries like Canada, Beveridge says. ', '″Not only does it potentially bring supply closer to an end user in future, a North American end user, but it also gives that end user the ability to say that they are using a cleaner source of nickel, which is obviously good for their marketing of their product.” ', 'But if domestic automakers all want to source nickel from these less carbon-intensive mines, Beveridge says that there’s just not enough supply right now to go around. He thinks the government may need to incentivize automakers to source nickel from sulfide mines over laterite mines, thereby encouraging more exploration and mine development.', 'Overall though, mining is only one step in the convoluted nickel supply chain. After nickel is mined, it’s often sent to another country to be refined or transformed into nickel sulfate, and sent overseas yet again for battery assembly. All of this transport just adds to the carbon-intensity of the whole process.', 'While there are plans for domestic nickel refineries in development, the U.S. currently doesn’t have any. So even if Tamarack is operational by its target date of 2026, that nickel still might get shipped around the world before ending up in American EVs.', 'Before anything else, the Tamarack mine needs to go through the environmental review and permitting process. And there’s no guarantee that this will be as quick and easy as Talon hopes.', 'The main concern with sulfide mining is potential pollution of the surrounding groundwater and surface water. In Minnesota, lawsuits have kept a different proposed copper-sulfide mine stuck in the environmental review and permitting process for 17 years. Maccabee, who has been a plaintiff in a number of these lawsuits, says the Tamarack project poses familiar worries.', '“There are a lot of community meetings and a lot of public relations. But when the community has asked, What is the evidence? Where is your hydrology evidence of where the pollution would go....? They have received no information whatsoever.”', 'Talon hopes to start the environmental review process by early next year, at which point the public will gain access to the information Maccabee wants. But she’s concerned that unless all the data is released upfront, regulators and the public will prematurely support the project.', 'If Talon does face community pushback and delays, that could end up voiding its deal with Tesla. The automaker can walk away from the deal if the mine isn’t up and running by 2026.', 'Adrian Gardner, Principal Nickel Analyst at Wood Mackenzie, thinks that’s an overly ambitious target. “It was a good deal earlier than would be possible, feasible in our view, for permitting approval and construction.”', 'But Gardner believes that lithium-ion battery recycling, as opposed to mining, could provide a more fruitful and sustainable supply of nickel anyway. Though this technology is still quite new, battery recycling companies like Li-Cycle and Redwood Materials have already entered into partnerships with major automakers.', '″There are at least five or six companies within the USA alone, each of whom have their own proprietary technologies,” Gardner says, though he doubts that recycling alone will provide all the nickel needed. “Will it be sufficient to cover off total EV demand? I doubt it, but it is in tandem with the traditional technologies that are available and used today.”', 'Even as battery recycling ramps up and gets cheaper, mining for nickel is still going to be a part of the equation. The Tamarack project, if it does get permitted, would only make a small dent in the global nickel shortage. But the Talon team hopes that this project will help to prove that mining can be done in an environmentally responsible manner.', '″I’d like for our teams to be able to say that we found it. We developed it... Environmentally friendly, socially responsible metals, ” van Rooyen said, ” And that it’s driving our vehicles and that these metals are going to be recycled into the next battery and the next battery. So I’ll be long gone and these metals will still be alive. ', 'Watch the video to learn more about nickel mining and to see the work going on at Talon Metal’s proposed mine in Tamarack, Minnesota.']"

As of this week, Wall Street and investors had one more iconic name to add into both financial engineering columns: Harley-Davidson.', 'The motorcycle maker announced plans to spin off its electric bike division, LiveWire, as a new company through a SPAC deal that values Harley’s EV business at roughly $1.8 billion.', 'That’s not near the valuations some of the EV car makers, including Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group, have seen after recent market debuts, but it points to a fundamental challenge legacy companies, long leaders in their market, face as the world changes and mega trends such as energy transition and electrification become more central to investing.', 'Across multiple sectors, climate change is leading to calls for a rethinking of how iconic companies are structured. Royal Dutch Shell recently came under activist investor pressure to consider spinning off its renewable energy business. GM and Ford, while expressing no interest on their own, have been subject to questions from the market as to whether new EV businesses may be better as stand-alone companies.', '“If anything this underlines what we’ve been saying for a long time. Detroit, wake up! The train has left the station! EVs are inevitable,” Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said in the Reuters report on the Harley-Davidson deal. “Many traditional OEMs (Original equipment manufacturers) with emerging EV businesses can obviously do similar spinoff transactions.”', 'The special purpose acquisition company that LiveWire will merge with is an ESG-focused SPAC, AEA-Bridges Impact Corporation.', 'Climate change isn’t the only major transition theme that is leading to calls for corporate breakups, as major department store companies including Macy’s and Kohl’s face investor pressure to spin off online retail operations as e-commerce continues to grow. And these debates about how best to realize shareholder value are taking place on a broader landscape of corporate spinoffs involving iconic companies from GE to Johnson & Johnson.', 'For Harley-Davidson, the spinoff plan raises short-term questions about how best to fund and build a new business for a new transportation and consumer era, and longer-term questions about where the greater value will reside in the Harley-Davidson brand in the future — it will retain 74% control of the new company’s shares.', 'Growth assets in the EV space are being valued differently than mature low/no growth assets like an internal combustion engine manufacturing enterprise, according to David S. MacGregor, Longbow Research analyst. “While the LiveWire spinoff isn’t yet being valued similar to other well-known EV stocks, the growth potential of the stand-alone business will be recognized in the years ahead and the valuation will follow,” he said. ', 'From a product standpoint, even though the legacy business and EV business are both two-wheel bikes, they are different product categories and at different stages of evolution. That leads to several considerations which favor a spinoff, according to MacGregor. For LiveWire to recruit the talent that will allow it to succeed, management will need the autonomy of a stand-alone company, which in turn will allow them to create financial incentives for key managers that tie directly to the achievement of performance milestones. Autonomy also means making decisions on capital with the benefits of a clear market story.', '“There is more for us to learn, but LiveWire was not likely to tap the flow of capital into electric vehicles as part of legacy Harley-Davidson,” wrote Craig Kennison, Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst in a note this week.', 'Research on corporate divestitures conducted by Emilie Feldman, professor of management at The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, indicates that similar thinking has benefitted in the recent history of corporate spinoffs.', '“My analysis is unequivocal,” Feldman recently told CNBC. “We definitely see these big performance improvements both in divesting companies and then equally when we look at the performance of the companies spun off, they tend to strongly perform after the completion of the separation from the former parent company,” said Feldman, whose book “Divestitures: Creating Value Through Strategies, Structure and Implementation,” will be published next year.', 'There are reasons for Harley-Davidson to separate the EV business as it continues with its own turnaround plan. It is not only the small developing business that can get lost inside the larger company to its detriment, but it can also be an added capital strain on a company facing major demographic and market shifts. It may be 2025 or 2026 before LiveWire reaches breakeven, and for Harley-Davidson it makes sense to not have that drain on its profit & loss statement while undergoing a broader turnaround plan under Harley-Davidson CEO and Chairman Jochen Zeitz.', '“Right now, both the new company and the legacy company are show-me stories, with investors not excited about HOG shares given the demographic issues that still weigh on the traditional heavyweight bike market. Even as the new management team is executing on the right strategies, it is still faced with the challenges created by the previous management team’s mistakes, and we expect that will take a couple more years to resolve,” MacGregor said.', 'In some obvious ways, the two companies will remain attached at the hip. Zeitz will be Chairman and acting CEO of LiveWire, while Harley-Davidson CFO Gina Goetter will serve as acting CFO.', 'Baird noted LiveWire gets the freedom to fund new product development and accelerate its go-to-market model while also benefitting from the manufacturing scale and distribution capabilities of Harley and Taiwan-based scooter and e-bike company KYMCO, which is also on the deal.', 'Strategic priorities and R&D also overlap.', 'As the largest producer of heavyweight gasoline-powered motorbikes, Harley-Davidson is “uniquely positioned to shape the future of the motorcycle industry,” Baird wrote in its ESG summary of Harley.', 'Zeitz, who set up Harley’s sustainability committee after he joined as CEO, told CNBC this week he asked the company “to think long term and think electrification” and he is now betting it will be the leading EV brand in bikes in a decade. “Through LiveWire, we can really spearhead the electrification of the sport and that’s why taking the final ultimate step to spin it off is just a logical thing to do now,” he said.', 'While LiveWire is focusing more on the urban consumer, Zeitz says it can also bring the technology back into Harley, which he described as a key objective. “While we have huge potential still for Harley-Davidson as a brand and as a company, this will be one of the key strategic elements that will help us to achieve our ultimate goals,” he said.', 'Harley’s timing wasn’t great for a SPAC, just as market volatility intensifies and investors become skittish on growth stories and some of the hottest tech trends. Rivian sold off after its earnings this week, with a forecast for lower than expected production, and some recent SPACs, while getting deals done, have seen heavy selling.', 'Harley shares popped up on the spinoff news early this week, but have traded back down since to where the stock has been stuck in the mid-$30s range after rallying earlier under Zeitz’s new management strategy, which received high marks from Wall Street.', 'Zeitz told CNBC earlier this year, “Electrification is a given.”', 'But LiveWire isn’t a 2022 story in terms of the numbers. Today, the LiveWire business is a blip, a base of 387 LiveWire motorcycles and $33 million in revenue in 2021, according to Baird research. This is not how the street values the EV story, anyway — Rivian reported $1 million in revenue in its earnings, but even after its decline is sitting on an $80 billion-plus market cap.', 'Harley forecasts sales of over 100,000 electric bikes generating $1.77 billion in revenue in 2026, and by 2030, roughly 190,000 EVs generating $3 billion in revenue. Baird’s current forecast for traditional motorcycle shipments this year is 186,000 bikes.', '“It’s not going to be linear of course and a lot will depend on when we launch new product into the market,” Zeitz said. “There’s lots of opportunity there to grow the business and, you know, if you look at the overall adoption rate, we see that increasing dramatically over the next few years.”', 'The deal may not achieve the valuation some other “concept stocks” received this year, but analysts say getting the deal out the door and creating the autonomy for the brand may be more important, especially to recruit top management to the new effort.', 'Ultimately, few people will argue that in the future there won’t be more EVs on the road than internal combustion vehicles, whether it is cars or bikes, and Harley has a lead in many aspects of the bike business to lean into, from its dealer network to servicing and finance.

93,Lithia & Driveway CEO says he’s hopeful supply of vehicles will improve later this year,2021-08-19T23:30:39+0000,"['The CEO of Lithia & Driveway, formerly known as Lithia Motors, told CNBC on Thursday he’s hopeful the availability of vehicles for sale improves later in 2021. ', 'The global auto industry has been plagued by a shortage of semiconductors that has limited production at a time during the coronavirus pandemic when demand for personal vehicles skyrocketed. The result has been depleted inventories and a huge jump in used cars prices, contributing to a rise in inflation in the U.S. economy.', 'In an interview with on “Mad Money” with Jim Cramer, Lithia’s Bryan DeBoer noted the Oregon-based car retailer sells both new and used vehicles and, as a result, “we’re able to balance inventory so we can keep pricing quite attractive.” ', '“We exited the quarter with about a 58-day supply in used which is plenty of used cars to keep prices as competitive as we possible can,” DeBoer said. “We were only at about 25-day supply in new vehicles on a little bit lower sales rate so new cars are a little tight still. But we see going into the second half of the year that things should be starting trough out and hopefully supplies return.” ', 'July retail sales fell more than Wall Street expected, according to government data released earlier this week, and one of the biggest drops came from motor vehicles and parts dealers, which declined 3.9%. ', 'The multiple rounds of Covid stimulus checks, plus the recent expansion of the child tax credit, have helped U.S. consumers be in a position to buy vehicles, DeBoer said. At this point, though, the executive said his advice for would-be customers is “be a little patient.” ', '“There’s more cars to come. We won’t have major shortages. Our manufacturers are figuring out ways to adjust with that supply chain, and I know as we reach further into the year, there probably won’t be quite as much demand, which will help balance things out some.” ', 'In its most recent quarterly report, Lithia reported the largest per-share earnings and revenue in its history. Shares of Lithia closed Thursday’s session at $333.78, declining 1.72%. The stock is up 14% year to date and 27.64% over the past 12 months.']"
