Doing so would prove particularly disruptive for America’s industrial and technology heavyweights that rely on the Chinese manufacturing base as critical parts of their supply chains. China still makes roughly 25% of all manufactured goods around the world — in part because of the difficulty in finding a sufficient workforce on other countries’ factory floors.', 'Given the proximity to China, Southeast Asian countries including Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia have attracted attention in recent months as potential alternative sourcing destinations.

With the ice in retreat, those resources will come increasingly within reach.', 'At a December meeting of climate scientists in New Orleans, a team from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared that the Arctic as we’ve known it is now a thing of the past. Coining a new phrase — the New Arctic — they described the uptick in ocean surface warming and decline in sea ice since 2000 as unprecedented in the past 1,500 years. The Arctic, they wrote, “shows no sign of returning to [the] reliably frozen region of past decades.”', 'As the ice pulls back, corporations and governments are moving in. Seaport facilities, mining operations, oil and gas pipelines — as well as new roads, railways and airstrips to serve them — are arriving in the region at an accelerating pace.

The world’s largest country has moved to reopen some abandoned Soviet-era military installations and place new facilities and airfields in its northern territory, while also establishing a string of seaports along its northern coastline. State-controlled oil company Rosneft started drilling the northernmost rig in the Russian Arctic shelf last year in an attempt to tap into a field that could hold more than half a billion barrels of oil. In June it found its first oilfield, in the Laptev Sea in the eastern Arctic.

In January the Trump administration announced plans to open up much of the U.S. outer continental shelf to offshore drilling, including areas off the north shore of Alaska.', 'But it’s the emergence of China — a nation with no territorial claim to the Arctic — as a rising polar power that has the potential to shake up the competition for resources and influence in the region. With its economic and naval power on the rise, China has begun underwriting Arctic development projects despite its lack of territory there, underscoring the region’s growing global importance.', 'Though not all of the Arctic infrastructure projects logged by Guggenheim will be completed, “the level of projects has been improving,” says Jim Pass, a senior managing director at Guggenheim Partners who has traveled extensively in the region. Projects once deemed largely conceptual have matured into well-thought-out capital infrastructure projects that show meaningful return on investment, he says. As the ice continues to recede, a race is on to develop or buy into the projects that can best position states and companies to compete in the New Arctic.', 'In December, at about the same time climate scientists were discussing the latest Arctic Report Card in New Orleans, a tanker departed Russia’s Yamal LNG facility on the country’s northeastern Yamal peninsula bound for the UK.

Finland, owner of the world’s second-largest icebreaker fleet has seven, followed by Canada and Sweden at six apiece. The U.S. has five, only one of which is a so-called heavy icebreaker. Scrambling to update its aging fleet, the U.S. Coast Guard plans to build six more (three heavy and three medium icebreakers), though the first won’t be delivered until 2023.', 'Energy resources will likely remain the driver of major investments in the Arctic for the foreseeable future, but for all the fanfare around them highly visible energy projects like Yamal LNG only paint a fraction of the economic picture in the Arctic, Pass says. Guggenheim’s Arctic project inventory includes a data center in Norway, a Finnish biomass-to-ethanol plant, and a Swedish lithium-ion battery factory, among many other projects that fall outside the more conventional categories of fossil fuels, mining, roads and railways. ', 'But the greatest opportunity, he says, is arguably in transport — not just within the Arctic but through it. Much of the Arctic likely won’t see ice-free summertime shipping lanes for some time, perhaps two decades or longer. But other routes, like the Northern Sea Route along Russia’s northern shore are already navigable — albeit not easily — during certain times of the year, trimming some 30 percent to 40 percent off the distance ships would travel between East Asia and Northern Europe if they traversed the conventional Suez Canal route instead. Russia has already installed more than a dozen seaports along the route at places like Arkhangelsk and Murmansk, in the country’s northwest, to Tiksi and Pevek in the northeast.', 'Meanwhile, if data really is the new oil, the New Arctic could be home to those pipelines as well. Undersea cables laid through the Arctic could one day connect Asia, Northern Europe, and North America more directly, providing far shorter routes for data traveling around the northern hemisphere.', '“Whether it’s the fraction of a millisecond it takes for financial transactions to travel between Tokyo and London or whether it’s shorter shipping routes from Northern Europe to China, the Arctic shortens distances,” says Heather Conley, senior vice president for Europe, Eurasia, and the Arctic at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “As globalization continues to emphasize speed, the Arctic will continue to be an important part of our story.”', 'More from Global Investing Hot Spots:Investors get ready for a surge in blockbuster China IPOs Argentina’s president powers biggest stock market boom in the world How Trump can crush the emerging markets stock rally in 2018', 'The story of the New Arctic could nonetheless prove slow to unfold. Though the ice is receding, the Arctic remains a difficult environment in which to operate. The intense cold alone presents challenges not present in other maritime environments, and while sea-ice measurements from last year were, on average, a full quarter lower than the average across three decades prior to 2010, there’s still plenty of ice in the water. Shipping concerns dreaming of an Arctic that’s both easily navigable and inexpensive to traverse will have to wait, perhaps for decades.', 'China has nonetheless taken a keen interest in what the Arctic has to offer in terms of global shipping, fishing stocks, energy security and other mineral resources. The Chinese government has taken what is arguably the longest view in the region, using its financial might to secure access to resources it cannot obtain through territorial claims.', 'For instance, when funding for the the Yamal LNG facility fell short following the imposition of U.S. sanctions on Russia in 2014, China stepped in with $12 billion in financing to finish the project.

Right now they’re exploring their economic opportunities and making sure they have a seat at the negotiating table if anything gets decided about future use of the Arctic.”', 'Last summer Chinese authorities expanded the country’s $1 trillion global infrastructure initiative, known as Belt and Road, to include an Arctic component, bringing the region into China’s larger vision for a connected world with China at the hub. At the same time, a Chinese icebreaker on a scientific mission completed a circumpolar navigation, traversing both the Northern Sea Route along Russia’s northern shore and the Northwest Passage atop North America. It continues to explore free-trade deals in Scandinavia and Canada, while pushing for scientific collaboration in the Arctic as well.', '“There’s high diplomatic engagement and initiative. The Belt and Road initiative now has an Arctic manifestation, and they have a continued interest in science,” Conley said. “The new economic dynamic is that China is very present in the Arctic.”', 'Climatological concerns aside — and there are many — one ancillary consequence of a melting Arctic is a rise in human activity there. This includes an uptick in commercial and scientific traffic and also in military presence and activity. For Russia, in particular, the receding sea ice represents the withdrawal of a natural barrier that has long protected its northern border, prompting its military to boost capability and presence in the region as a means for securing both its border and the increasingly valuable sea lanes and resource wealth beyond.', '“What we’re seeing now is a very slow refreezing of the Arctic geopolitically,” Conley said. “Russia has continued its military modernization in the north, and while it’s not massive, it’s definitely a change in posture.”', 'The growing Russian military presence in the region has stoked old feelings of mistrust, she said, producing antibodies within NATO that are now pushing for an increased Western military presence in the region as well. “We’re not going back by any stretch to a cold war posture, but you’re starting to see that muscle memory coming back,” she said. “And it’s because we’re seeing this uptick in military activity.”', 'The notion that the Arctic might evolve into a flashpoint for global tensions remains remote. The region has long proved a place of international cooperation, where Arctic states settle boundary disputes and other conflicts amicably at the negotiating table (as Russia and Norway did as recently as 2010). But as military activity in the region trends upward alongside commercial activity, the chance of accidents, misunderstandings and miscommunications heightens as well.', 'In a New Arctic with emerging strategic and economic value and where norms are still being established, the potential for tensions to escalate is real. If the Arctic shortens distances, countries that once felt quite far apart may soon find themselves much closer together as the ice recedes.', 'Wary of what geopolitical realities the New Arctic may hold, military planners are already taking such factors into consideration. At a Surface Navy Association event near the Pentagon earlier this month, Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Paul Zukunft noted that the Coast Guard’s new heavy icebreaker will be unarmed when it enters service in 2023.

It’s great that you can  sing,” he said. “But if you don’t understand the business, then  the people around you are going to take advantage of your  business.”', ' Peréz listens to mentors and others in the business  community, which may be the key to his meteoric rise, especially  among the Latin community. He cites Warren  Buffett and Carlos Slim as people he  admires — clearly looking well beyond the entertainment  industry for business acumen.

', '  Many brands approach Peréz, but his strategy for selecting  his partnerships is much more about feelings than business  acumen, he claims.', '  For Peréz, first impressions are really important, and so  are personal relationships. “To be honest with you, the first  thing I do is size up the person who is a potential partner,” he  said. “I don’t care if a multibillion-dollar business opportunity  comes my way,” he said. “I don’t need a multitrillion-dollar  headache.”', '  Peréz has been widely vocal about the music industry’s  biggest miss: streaming music. At the eMerge technology conference in  Miami last May, he said he believes the biggest mistake was that  the music industry didn’t partner up with Steve Jobs  and Apple. Many artists, like Taylor  Swift and Jay Z, are vocal about the streaming business not being  lucrative to the artists. Peréz agrees that although it’s  a way to get music out globally, deals need to be restructured.', ' Read MorePitbull: Buffett  listens to his gut', '  Robbins and a chorus of others who’ve gotten to know “Pitbull”  seem to have no doubt the entertainer has whatever it takes to  ensure continued success in the ever-changing entertainment  industry.', '  That’s because he’s fearless and determined to live out the  American dream.

And they aren’t the only ones. Female founders and CEOs, female venture capitalists, and powerful figures such as Melinda Gates are banding together to raise more money for female-run companies, raise it through more diverse venture firms, build what they believe will be a new crop of billion-dollar businesses across a set of sectors from consumer to robotics and medicine, and hold on to more of the start-up equity that is currently being banked by the rich boys network of Silicon Valley.', 'The high-level numbers illustrating the industry’s gender gap are motivation enough.

She also is a member of the All Raise organization, which is trying to raise awareness about diversity as part of the fundraising equation for female-founded start-ups. “The world is colorful in thought, but the boardroom is not, and we are going to change that and get more women excited at the top end of the funnel working with younger women,” Quintini said.', 'She thinks diversity of thought, not just when it comes to women but other underrepresented groups in the start-up and VC world, will reap big returns for investors. “The job of a venture firm is to have a strong point of view and not have a lot of investors agree with you at the beginning,” Quintini said. “If everyone already agrees, the returns get muted. You need to be right and ahead of everyone else. We want people a little later on to agree with us.”', 'Women venture capitalists and founders sense a big opportunity that Silicon Valley’s old guard are either neglecting or unable to understand.

Women are the dominant consumer. If you back founders that intuitively understand that end user, the people buying or who are the most active on social media, the influencers, there is probably a competitive advantage, especially since the majority of VCs just aren’t getting it.”', 'Two BBG portfolio companies, Modsy and Finery, are on the 2018 CNBC Upstart 100 list.

Some is to avoid obvious criticisms, but they also are starting to realize they need to have a partner who does have a different viewpoint.”', 'All Raise had 1,500 female founders apply for 500 mentorships, and Quintini recalled that a common question centered on investors not understanding pitches involving products for female consumers, which made founders worried they needed to change the business. “Understand you are talking to the wrong person,” Quintini said.', '“These VC firms have to get past this idea that consumer companies are ‘nice little businesses,’” Lyne said. “I think we will see an increasing number of unicorns in the consumer space over the next five years and I do believe it will change the way VCs think about sourcing deals more than anything. A number of companies that are a little bit behind Stitch Fix and Eventbrite but are on the IPO track and once you get a half dozen, and then a dozen, with female founders ... that will change the ball game.”', 'This dynamic also is starting to reach the level of the retail store experience.

Almost half the team at 23andMe is seriously smart, strong-willed women.”', 'Jill Hagenkord, 23andMe’s former chief medical officer — and a “badass,” according to Yu — “showed me it was OK to speak my mind, even if it was edgy or even inappropriate. ... In my wedding vows, my husband said, ‘When I met you, you were a timid but smart banker, and now that’s completely changed.’ It was really through 23andMe,” Yu said.', '“Women have to feel comfortable building really big businesses,” said Alana Branston, co-founder and CEO of Bulletin.', 'Branston said she hears a lot about the average investment round size being lower for female founders, and about the overall funding level being lower, and the data can be “pretty depressing.” But it is just another hurdle to overcome and ultimately there is only one way to overcome it. “More women building big businesses is most effective way to change the dynamic,” she said. “So much of it is having confidence to know you can go and build something really big. Lots of female founders I know think of their model in terms of being a smaller idea while male founders feel more comfortable making grandiose statements. Building the next Airbnb or Uber would be hard, but female founders are capable of doing it.”', 'Bulletin is planning to expand next year to five more cities around the U.S., including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Austin and Boston.', '“I would never say women need to act more like men, but for many different reasons women are not as aggressive or assertive about how big a company can be and how fast; they don’t go into the pitch room with bravado,” Layfield said. “That goes against what VCs want. .. Being pragmatic makes us better entrepreneurs but can work against us in fundraising.”', 'For female founders fortunate enough to have avoided bad experiences with VCs and, to this day, have male investment partners and mentors instrumental to their success — and there are many of them, including many of the Upstart 100 companies interviewed for this article — the magnitude of the challenge and the avenues for progress can come outside the pitch meeting and after having already had much success.', 'Shirley Chen, the founder and CEO of Narrativ, an Upstart 100 advertising technology company that works with publishers of review sites to drive online consumer sales, had everything go right for her: Early childhood in Beijing, where math and science were part of a rigorous core curriculum that all girls and boys went through; attending the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Virginia, a top 10 high school in the U.S. with a STEM focus; and a job at McKinsey where she never had to think twice about speaking up in the room with a senior partner or senior public company executive.', 'Her realization came when her success at Narrativ led to a dinner invitation for top adtech executives: Chen was one of only two women at the exclusive industry dinner. She went back to work and had an intern compile a spreadsheet on the 50 largest adtech start-ups. Across the firms, which had raised closed to $4 billion in venture, not one had a female CEO.', '“I never knew what the stats were and the results were even more dramatic than I imagined,” Chen said. “Just because I didn’t experience it doesn’t mean it isn’t true.”', 'Now building her team at Narrativ, Chen also sees the issue arise when female engineers don’t negotiate over salary, and when seeing a pipeline of engineers that is only about 20 percent women. Chen said she has a better understanding now and Narrativ has made a commitment to keep its team gender-balanced and interviewing female engineers for senior roles. “When you’re under the gun to deliver on revenue it is so much easier to hire a senior engineer who is a guy than take a risk on a younger engineer who is a woman. But start-ups need to be cognizant of the tradeoffs they are making to ship a product next month.” She added, “Even though Narrativ is a small company with 30 employees, that can have a larger impact as you grow.”', 'Clara Vu, co-founder of Upstart 100 company Veo Robotics and a former iRobot engineer, said being a woman in engineering for two decades has often means figuring it out for yourself and feeling your way through the dark. Being the only woman in math classes or the only woman on an engineering team was the default. Many young female engineers, instead of moving up the leadership ladder, get sidelines into product liaison roles, “soft skills” positions, and that has led to a pipeline problem, not enough young women engineers encouraged to seek leadership.', 'Veo chooses its VC based on the ones that can best support its growth rather than on the makeup of the VC firm, but the firm and Vu are attuned to having a management team that is half women and Vu specifically, have one-quarter of the engineering team be female, which she said is well above average. “We are all used to being the only person in the bathroom,” she said.', 'Vu said she does not have a quantitative goal for the engineering team, especially as start-up trying to find the one person with the skill set you need and when you need them, and given the engineering population is majority male and specialized. “It would be hard to have a 50-percent female team, but I do think that I can definitely make an effort to get more diverse candidates in the door in the hiring process, reach out to women and other underrepresented people.” And she added that these candidates are often well above average, “because below average ones wouldn’t have made it that far.”', 'Having more women on the team can help to address one of the the biggest statistical gaps for women in the start-up community: male domination when it comes to the cap table, or in other words, who holds all the equity in firms.', 'A report released in late September by equity management software platform     Carta showed who really has the wealth in Silicon Valley: Women only hold 9 percent of employee and founder equity.', '“We’re not the ones that are going to be getting rich when these companies do well,” said Sara Mauskopf, a former Google employee and co-founder and CEO of parenting information platform Winnie. “Every way you look at it, women are not getting the wealth created in these companies, in a really disproportionate way,” she said. “All the advances made, getting women to work in tech and more female founders are not represented in terms of the wealth.”', 'The situation led Mauskopf to publish Winnie’s cap table, a move she said is unheard of in the industry. “Most companies would look bad if they published this information,” she said. Winnie’s cap table is over 70 percent female, split between employees, founders and VCs, and that is unusual and it was an intentional decision. “We wanted women to get wealthy, and we believe we are going to make a lot of money and we want that money going to women,” Mauskopf said.', 'The Winne CEO said in the same way most public companies now report on diversity measurements, she is hopeful that cap tables will become more public, and it is an agenda she will try to promote through larger organizations like All Raise and Founders for Change, though it will be a much slower change that broader diversity measures since start-ups and VCs “can’t just go and hire a bunch of women and minorities and see changes in the cap table.”', 'Many female founders stress that their most critical goal isn’t diversity, or worrying, but building their current venture to a successful exit. “I work my ass off, that’s the best thing I can do,” said Tamara Mellon CEO Layfield. “Building a big business will pave the way for it to be easier for the next female who asks for money.”', 'X Factor Ventures’ Palmer said the biggest takeaway for her VC firm one year after its launch was the realization of just how many women there are building interesting, venture-scale companies. “We knew there was a culture of women building start-ups but weren’t quite sure how large it was. The number of companies we’ve seen through partners or through email introductions is a little over a thousand,” she said. “The sheer volume was eye-opening. And we want to arm as many women as we can with checkbooks.”', 'Lyne said when BBG Ventures was launched four years ago, many peers in the VC community said it was a “nice goal” to start a fund that will invest in female founders, but they added, “There just aren’t enough of them to really sustain a fund for a long period of time.”', '“We have seen over 4,000 companies in four years with female founders,” Lyne said.', 'Disclosure: CNBC parent Comcast is an investor in Modsy.']"
28,Amazon Says It Puts Customers First. But Its Pricing Algorithm Doesn’t.,2016-09-20T15:19:19+0000,"['This article originally ran on ProPublica.org and is republished here with permission.', '  One day recently, we visited Amazon’s website in search of the best deal on  Loctite super glue, the essential home repair tool for fixing  everything from broken eyeglass frames to shattered ceramics.', '  In an instant, Amazon’s software sifted through dozens of  combinations of price and shipping, some of which were cheaper  than what one might find at a local store. TheHardwareCity.com,  an online retailer from Farmers Branch, Texas, with a 95 percent  customer satisfaction rating, was selling Loctite for $6.75 with  free shipping. Fat Boy Tools of Massillon, Ohio, a competitor  with a similar customer rating was nearly as cheap: $7.27with  free shipping.', '  The computer program brushed aside those offers, instead  selecting the vial of glue sold by Amazon itself for slightly  more, $7.80. This seemed like a plausible choice until another  click of the mouse revealed shipping costs of $6.51. That brought  the total cost, before taxes, to $14.31, or nearly double the  price Amazon had listed on the initial page.', '  What kind of sophisticated shopping algorithm steers customers to  a product that costs so much more than seemingly comparable  alternatives?', '  One that substantially favors Amazon and sellers it charges for  services, an examination by ProPublica  found.', ' More from ProPublica:  Company that sued soldiers settles Colorado lawsuitIllinois sues controversial drug maker over deceptive marketing practicesUncovering a $1 billion deal to detain unauthorized immigrants', '  Amazon often says it seeks to be “Earth’s most customer-centric  company.” Jeffrey  P. Bezos, its founder and CEO, has been known to put an empty chair in meetings  to remind employees of the need to focus on the customer. But in  fact, the company appears to be using its market power and  proprietary algorithm to advantage itself at the expense of  sellers and many customers.', '  Unseen and almost wholly unregulated, algorithms play an  increasingly important role in broad swaths of American life.  They figure in decisions large and small, from whether a person  qualifies for a mortgage to the sentence someone  convicted of a crime might serve. The weightings and variables  that underlie these equations are often closely guarded secrets  known only to people at the companies that design and use them.', '  But while the math is hidden from public view, the effects of  algorithms can be vast. With more than 300 million active  customer accounts and more than $100 billion in annual revenue,  Amazon is a shopping giant whose algorithm can make or break  other retailers. And so ProPublica set out to see how Amazon’s  software was shaping the marketplace.', '  We looked at 250 frequently purchased products over several weeks  to see which ones were selected for the most prominent placement  on Amazon’s virtual shelves — the so-called “buy box” that  pops up first as a suggested purchase. About three-quarters of  the time, Amazon placed its own products and those of companies  that pay for its services in that position even when there were  substantially cheaper offers available from others.', '  That turns out to be an important edge. Most Amazon shoppers end  up clicking “add to cart” for the offer highlighted in the buy  box. “It’s the most valuable small button on the Internet today,”  said Shmuli Goldberg, an Israeli technologist who has extensively  studied Amazon’s algorithm.', '  Amazon does give customers a chance to comparison shop, with a  listing that ranks all vendors of the same item by “price +  shipping.” It appears to be the epitome of Amazon’s  customer-centric approach. But there, too, the company gives  itself an oft-decisive advantage. Its rankings omit shipping  costs only for its own products and those sold by companies that  pay Amazon for its services.', '  We found that the practice earned Amazon-linked products higher  rankings in more than 80 percent of cases. Amazon’s offer of the  Loctite glue, a respectable No. 5 on the comparison list, dropped  to the 39th best deal when shipping was included. (The prices  Amazon shows are ranked correctly for those who pay $99 per year  for Amazon’s Prime shipping service and for those who are buying  $49 or more in eligible items.)', '  Erik Fairleigh, a spokesman for Amazon, said the algorithm that  selects which product goes into the “buy box” accounts for a  range of factors beyond price. “Customers trust Amazon to have  great prices, but that’s not all— vast selection,  world-class customer service and fast, free delivery are  critically important,” he said in an e-mailed statement. “These  components, and more, determine our product listings.” (Read  Amazon’s statement.)', '  Fairleigh declined to answer detailed questions, including  questions about why Amazon’s product rankings excluded shipping  costs only for itself and its paid partners.', '  The decision to allow non-Amazon companies to sell products on  the site was controversial within the company. But Bezos pushed  ahead, saying he was willing to lose sales if it made his company  more competitive in the long run. “If we side with the consumer  on that kind of decision,” he said at the 2007 annual shareholder  meeting, “over time it will force the right kind of behaviors on  ourself.”', '  At that meeting, a shareholder asked about Amazon’s practice of  promoting products sold by other companies on its website. Bezos  replied that the company had “very objective customer-centered  algorithms″ that automatically award the “buy box” to the lowest  price seller, provided “they actually have it in stock and can  deliver it.”', '  It is not clear why Amazon’s algorithm now pushes its own  products ahead of better deals offered by others. Perhaps Amazon  is taking the view that its widely admired shipping and delivery  offers the best possible satisfaction for customers, even if it  costs more.', '  Another possibility is that the company is trying to encourage  shoppers to join the Prime program, which offers free shipping on  many items (including the Loctite super glue). When non-Prime  customers initially view Amazon products, they are offered “FREE  Shipping on eligible orders.” When they reach the final page on  checkout, the shipping fees are revealed along with an  advertisement to avoid such fees by joining Prime.', '  The costs of simply buying the algorithm-selected choice can add  up. The average price difference between what the program  recommended and the truly cheapest price was $7.88 for the 250  products we tested. An Amazon customer who bought all the  products on our list from the buy box would have paid nearly 20  percent more — or about $1,400 extra — than if they had  bought the cheapest items being offered by other vendors.', '  Amazon’s algorithm also takes a toll on outside companies hoping  to sell products on the website. To increase their chances of  winning the buy box, many sellers are paying Amazon to warehouse  and ship their products through a program called “Fulfilled by  Amazon.” The fees for the program, which vary by size and weight  of the items being shipped, can amount to 10 to 20 percent of  sales.', '  Paying Amazon appears to be a sound strategy. Fulfilled by Amazon  vendors and Amazon itself were just about the only sellers —  94 percent of the cases we analyzed — that ever won the buy  box without having the cheapest product.', '  Through its rankings and algorithm, Amazon is quietly reshaping  online commerce almost as dramatically as it reshaped offline  commerce when it burst onto the scene more than 20 years ago.  Just as the company’s cheap prices and fast shipping caused a  seismic shift in retailing that shuttered stores selling books,  electronics and music, now Amazon’s pay-to-play culture is  forcing online sellers to choose between paying hefty fees or  leaving the platform altogether.', '  Consider BareBones WorkWear, a Sacramento clothing retailer that  has been selling on Amazon since 2004. This year, the company  removed nearly all of its items from Amazon, and shuttered a  warehouse and call center that were devoted to Amazon sales.', '  “Competition between us and Amazon is just insurmountable,”  BareBones chief operating officer Mason Moore said. The profit  margins for most clothing items were too low, he said, to allow  for the company to sell through the Fulfilled by Amazon, or FBA,  program. But, he said, “FBA is really the only avenue that we see  as any feasible way to do business with Amazon.” This week,  BareBones has just five items listed on Amazon — all of them  fulfilled by Amazon.', '  Last Christmas, so many vendors joined Fulfilled by Amazon that  the company ran out of space in some of its warehouses. This  year, the company has doubled its number of warehouses.', '  In July, Amazon reported record profits and the company’s chief  financial officer Brian Olsavsky told investors that Fulfilled by  Amazon growth was “really strong.”', '  Tech companies’ practice of favoring their own listings has  occasionally earned regulators’ scrutiny. The European  Commission, for example, has accused Google of violating EU  antitrust rules by favoring its own shopping service over those  of other vendors.', '  Amazon didn’t start as an open marketplace for online sellers.  When it opened its virtual doors in 1995, Amazon sold only its  own products. It began letting other vendors onto its product  listings in 2000.', '  “Our judgment was simple,” Bezos wrote of that decision, in a  2005 letter to shareholders. “If a third party could offer a  better price or better availability on a particular item, then we  wanted our customer to get easy access to that offer.”', '  For merchants, listing their wares on Amazon was a great  opportunity. Amazon attracted legions of customers, well worth  the 6 to 25 percent commission merchants paid the online colossus  on each sale.', '  By 2007, more than 1 million third-party sellers had joined  Amazon. Collectively, they generated about 30 percent of unit  sales, the company said at the time.', '  One of the sellers Amazon attracted was Kate Erkavun. She had  recently received a master’s degree in industrial engineer, but  also sold cosmetics on eBay out of her apartment while her  husband worked at an engineering company.', '  “I was young, I had just graduated,” she said. “I worked in a  pharmaceutical company and I quit after seven months. I realized  it wasn’t for me.” She started selling makeup on eBay, and then  migrated to Amazon, too.', '  At first, Erkavun’s listings on Amazon were similar to her eBay  listings — one page for each product that customers could  page through at leisure. But over time, Amazon simplified the  design so that customers would only be presented with one default  vendor for each product.', '  Amazon’s algorithm would choose which seller would win that  default position — the buy box. While the exact formulas  used to pick the winner were secret, Amazon’s website advises  sellers that they can increase their chances by having low  prices, having items in stock, offering free shipping and getting  excellent customer service ratings.', '  To optimize their chances, many sellers starting using  algorithmic software to constantly change prices to adapt to  competitors’ moves. Soon, Amazon became a highly dynamic  marketplace, similar to a stock-trading floor, where prices for  products changed as often as every 15 minutes.', '  Erkavun and her husband, Gokhan, were determined to increase  their chances of sales. Gokhan, who quit his job to help run the  business, worked with a programmer to write software that  repriced their products throughout the day. And the couple bought  a building in Nutley, New Jersey, to store their approximately  10,000 shampoos, lipsticks, lotions and other cosmetics in a  temperature-controlled warehouse. They offered free shipping,  quick turnaround times and worked hard to keep their customer  service ratings high.', '  At first, their techniques seemed to be successful. In 2010,  Amazon sales were half of their revenue and profits were at a  record high. “We were very happy,” said Gokhan.', '  But in 2011, he said, Beauty Bridge’s sales started slipping as  Amazon entered the cosmetics business and began consistently  winning the buy box. “If you don’t win the buy box, your chance  of selling is low,” Kate said.', '  Sellers who don’t win the buy box are placed on a page called  “More Buying Choices,” on a list that Amazon describes as ranked  by price plus shipping. However, since Amazon doesn’t include the  cost of shipping for itself and its fulfillment partners, the  rankings on that page can be misleading.', '  One day recently, for instance, Amazon was listed as the  top-ranked seller — both in the buy box and at the top of  the buying choices page — for a self-tanning lotion called  Vita Liberata. Beauty Bridge was offering the lowest price at  $27.03, but Amazon had won the buy box with an offer of $29.98.', '  When a customer put the lotion from Amazon in her cart, the added  shipping cost brought the total to $35.46. Beauty Bridge was  offering free shipping — so with or without shipping, its  offer should have been listed higher than Amazon’s. But it was  not.', '  When Gokhan Erkavun was told of his lotion’s poor ranking despite  its cheaper price, he just sighed and said, “Amazon is not really  fair in terms of competition, but we don’t have much choice. We  have to be there.”', '  On its Canadian website, Amazon discloses that its own items are  ranked without shipping price. But in the United States, Amazon’s  website states that “the default sort order of the offer listing  is ascending Price + Shipping.”', '  Of course, most Amazon customers never make it to the More Buying  Choices page where Beauty Bridge’s listing was ranked poorly.  Among the countless consultants and conferences devoted to  winning the buy box, it’s well known that Amazon’s algorithm  gives an advantage to itself, and to sellers who pay to join the  Fulfilled by Amazon program.', '  “Amazon definitely does weight things in favor of the FBA  seller,” said Michael Butcher, senior account manager at  SellerEngine Software, which sells algorithmic pricing software  for Amazon sellers. “It does seem unfair and it is sometimes hard  for merchants.”', '  For a few years, Amazon even advertised the advantage it offered  to its paid partners. According to Web pages stored by the  Internet Archive, the Amazon website said: “Because most FBA  listings are ranked without a shipping cost, you get an edge when  competing!” The language remained on the page from February 2013  through December 2015.', '  This year, the language has been changed to: “As you grow your  competitive edge, you can increase your chance of winning the Buy  Box.”', '  But Beauty Bridge’s Kate and Gokhan Erkavun didn’t want to pay  the fees to join the program. They had their own warehouse and  didn’t need Amazon’s. And they estimated the program would cost  them at least an additional 15 percent of sales.', '  They held out until 2014. By then, sales had slid 30 percent from  the peak in 2010. In 2014, “we got to a point where we couldn’t  survive without doing FBA,” Gokhan said. Since joining the  “Fulfilled by Amazon” program, Gokhan says the company’s sales  have recovered, but profits have not because of the fees.', '  Gokhan is now hoping that Wal-Mart’s recent purchase of online  shopping website Jet.com will increase the pressure on Amazon to  give small online retailers a better deal.', '  “We need Wal-Mart to really get serious about competing with  Amazon,” he said. “Otherwise in 10 years, we aren’t going to have  many retailers left.”', '— Story by Julia Angwin and Surya Mattu at ProPublica.org']"

By far,” the “Mad Money” host said on Thursday, not long after applauding Musk’s unusual behavior on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street.”', 'The call, which sent shares of Tesla into a nosedive during after-hours trading, followed Tesla’s first-quarter earnings report. The car maker logged a narrower-than-expected loss.', 'Cramer particularly liked Musk’s jab at the short-sellers piling into the automaker’s stock: “We have no interest in satisfying the desires of day traders. I couldn’t care less. Please sell our stock, don’t buy it.”', '“Tesla’s stock is unnerving, not for the faint of heart. I sure don’t like it,” Cramer said. “I think people don’t understand the risks that are associated with it and how emotional it can be.”', 'As markets swung lower, then higher on Thursday amid geopolitical worries, Cramer vetted a new thesis about what could be next in the U.S.-China trade clash.', '“The new thesis I’m hearing is that the president’s woes are making the Chinese more intransigent,” Cramer explained. “They’re beginning to take a longer view that Trump’s in real trouble and they can take more pain than we can and wait out the president.”', '“In other words, the Mueller investigation weakens the Trump hand, and it could actually hurt the global economy if it results in a prolonged trade war,” he continued.', 'President Donald Trump, whose personal lawyer Michael Cohen is at the center of a scandal involving adult film actress Stormy Daniels, revealed on Monday that he knew of a $130,000 payment Cohen made to Daniels ahead of the 2016 election.', 'When Cramer-fave MGM Resorts’ stock plummeted more than 11 percent after its earnings report last week, the CNBC host couldn’t believe his eyes.', '“The selling here has been extreme,” Cramer said on Thursday. “Whenever we see this kind of action, we need to ask ourselves, are we looking at a broken company here — which means sell, sell, sell — or is it merely a broken stock?”', '“In other words, is this the kind of development that makes you want to sell MGM for good, or are we merely getting a buyable pullback in a stock that still has a compelling long-term story?” he said.', 'Cramer has long recommended buying the stock of MGM, a hospitality giant with numerous hotel and casino properties in Las Vegas including the Bellagio and Mandalay Bay.

We are supply-challenged,” the CEO said, brushing off a common misconception that cruise ship operators are over-supplied. “I only have 26 vessels. There are at least a dozen unserved or under-served markets ... [where] I need more vessels.”', 'Del Rio emphasized that the cruise ship business, while niche, is extremely stable, with visibility into the state of the business extending seven or eight months into the future.', '“And the barriers to entry – anyone can buy a piece of land and build a hotel,” he added after Cramer noted how cheaply Norwegian’s stock trades relative to hotel stocks. “You know how long it would take if you and I wanted to start a new cruise line today and get our first ship? Six, seven years.”', '“So the barriers to entry are great, you need a lot of capital, the order book at the major ship yards is all taken, supply growth is limited,” the CEO continued. “The analysts, the investors are all wound up because over the next two or three years, the supply growth is going to spike to 6, 6.5 percent from an average of 5 percent over the last 10 years.

Except one: Wall Street.', 'Just this week, old players in two major categories — logistics and pharmacies — turned into foes. FedEx terminated its ground-delivery contract with Amazon, two months after ending its U.S. express shipping deal. Meanwhile, CVS and Walgreens were accused of unfairly blocking Amazon-owned PillPack’s access to certain prescription data.', 'This comes after several years of stories about retail rivals’ refusal to use Amazon’s AWS cloud service so they could avoid funding its most lucrative business. Vendors and sellers often complain about Amazon’s marketplace policy, and sometimes threaten to stop selling there altogether. Even politically, Amazon has butted heads with city officials in Seattle and New York, while politicians on both sides are calling for tighter regulatory scrutiny on its business.', 'Wall Street doesn’t seem to care.', 'For the fourth straight month, all 45 analysts with ratings on Amazon’s stock recommend buying it, according to FactSet. That makes Amazon one of only three companies in the S&P 500, alongside Assurant and Diamondback Energy, to have perfect “buy” ratings. Even following last month’s earnings miss and lower-than-expected guidance, Amazon’s stock barely moved and didn’t see a single downgrade on its rating. Its stock is up 20% this year, outpacing the 16% rise of the broader S&P 500 index.', '“Amazon is expected to make more enemies as they grow larger,” said Loop Capital’s Anthony Chukumba, who raised his price target to $2,380 in May. “But none of this really concerns me — everybody hates Goliath.”', 'Chukumba said the hostile reaction is only natural as Amazon has become a dominant force and is known for its almost limitless ambition. But the animosity is having little effect on his investment decision because he doesn’t believe any of it is going to have a significant impact on Amazon’s long-term financial prospects.', '“That’s what it really comes down to,” Chuckumba said, referring to Amazon’s continued growth. “The track record speaks for itself.”', 'In a series of statements, Amazon noted that AWS retains many retail customers, and that third-party sales on Amazon.com are growing faster than Amazon’s first-party sales.', 'For Amazon, Wall Street’s support and a strong share price are particularly important as stock makes up a relatively high percentage of workforce compensation. This is true even for top execs: AWS CEO Andy Jassy and consumer retail CEO Jeff Wilke received just $175,000 in cash last year, with the rest of their $19 million compensation coming in the form of stock rewards.', 'Hari Srinivasan, an analyst at Neuberger Berman, said that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has earned Wall Street’s trust through years of investments that have resulted in fruitful returns. While most companies do one thing very well, Amazon has managed to build a leading position in two major categories — e-commerce and cloud business — and continues to invest in other areas like advertising.', 'For example, the recent investment in one-day shipping, which cost Amazon over $800 million in the second-quarter alone, showed immediate results with a huge bounce back in online sales, giving investors “greater comfort” in the company’s heightened spend, Srinivasan said.', '“From a technology investment point of view, I think Bezos has the greatest amount of respect from investors,” he said.', 'Still, analysts say there are a couple of growing risk factors for Amazon that they are keeping a close eye on.', 'One of them is the broader economic climate and the potential for a long-term recession. Although the main data points like employment and consumer spending point to a healthy economy, talks of a looming recession is keeping investors on edge, Srinivasan said. When there’s a recession, there’s a slowdown in revenue, and a big market correction usually follows. And consumer companies like Amazon tend to be more exposed to those downturns than enterprise companies like Microsoft or Oracle, who get the bulk of their revenue from business customers, he said.', '“It’s a cloud on the horizon that’s worth monitoring,” Srinivasan said.', 'The bigger concern, perhaps, is the regulatory environment surrounding Amazon. The antitrust probe and calls for breaking up Amazon still have a long way to go before becoming a major risk for Amazon, analysts say, but there’s always a chance that a compelling case could emerge and threaten the company. Jason Helfstein, an analyst at Oppenheimer, said Amazon seems to have less immediate antitrust risk than Facebook and Google, but nonetheless it’s an issue that keeps investors worried.', '“Just in general, investors don’t love the whole climate around regulation in Washington D.C. and the rest of the world,” Helfstein said.', 'Follow @CNBCtech on Twitter for the latest tech industry news.']"

The popularity of increasingly advanced mobile games is driving demand for better hardware, and a few companies are stepping into the arena with phones designed specifically for gaming.', 'While the vast majority of current smartphones support casual games — think Candy Crush and Pokémon Go — these new phones are targeting players of competitive online and graphically intensive games like Fortnite and PUBG Mobile.', 'The world’s most popular phones, like the Apple iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy line, have high-end hardware specifications capable of handling sophisticated games. In August, Samsung launched its latest “phablet,” the Galaxy Note 9, advertising it as gaming-friendly and highlighting increased battery life and quick cooling.', 'However, the top mainstream phones are not conducive to serious mobile gaming.', '“One doesn’t have to have a gaming phone in order to play these games. But one doesn’t have to have a gaming PC in order to play many PC games, either. And yet PC gamers will opt for more optimized hardware to give them that extra edge,” Bryan Ma, vice president of client devices research at IDC, said via email. “Gaming phones won’t necessarily appeal to more mainstream users, but some enthusiasts will look for specs like high-refresh-rate screens to give themselves a better experience.”', 'Gaming hardware company Razer is betting that the market for gaming phones is for real. Headquartered in San Francisco and Singapore, the company is known for selling PC and console-gaming peripherals, as well as its own line of gaming laptops. Following generally positive reviews on its first smartphone, which debuted in November 2017, the company launched a successor on Oct. 10. While many products in the mobile phone market are rounded, Razer’s design language is more square.', 'Samsung’s Galaxy S8 popularized the concept of minimizing bezels, the borders between a phone’s screen and its frame. Other Android phones followed, with makers such as Essential, LG and Huawei releasing their own almost bezel-less phones. Apple then heated up the race to maximize screen real estate with the iPhone X’s smaller bezels and notch, a trend now making its way to Android phones, like Google’s Pixel 3 and the OnePlus 6.', 'While the notch and lack of bezels are considered design enhancements by many, they may not be favorable to mobile gamers who often hold the device horizontally in their hands and need to see as much of the screen as possible. Top and bottom bezels provide a place for gamers to grip the phone and help position their thumbs.', '“Ultimately, we did a lot of study and research and realized that actually, a square design is very comfortable. Because of the way the hand holds it, the corners don’t really affect the use case,” said Stéphane Blanchard, director of industrial design at Razer.', 'With the square design set, the Razer team decided that the best place to put the powerful stereo front-facing speakers — an important feature for gamers — was on bezels to the left and right of the screen when held horizontally.', '“We have a blocky design, and we have big bezels. All combined, it is actually a great advantage because we have a great grip where we still hold the edges without covering the speakers to have great sound,” Blanchard said.', 'With this distinctive bulky design and bezels, Razer is “bucking the trend,” said Matt Swider, a senior editor at technology news and review site TechRadar.', 'Both the new Razer Phone 2 and its predecessor boast the best screen refresh rate of any phone, at 120Hz. High screen refresh rates provide smoother experiences and allow for potentially quicker response times helpful in fast-paced games. Apple’s iPad Pros have this feature, but even the newest iPhones are capped at 60Hz.', '“The difference you see in a high-refresh-rate display is not just tied to gaming. You can see it with scrolling through a web page,” said Vivek Gowri, a senior manager of hardware engineering at Razer.', 'Recent reviews of the Razer Phone 2 say the model builds on its predecessor’s strengths as a serious contender for gamers and multimedia users, but it fails to measure up in ways that may be more important to most phone users — for example, the improved screen brightness and camera are still lacking compared to the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and Google Pixel 3.', 'The Razer Phone’s main competition in trying to grow a gamer phone market is the Asus ROG Phone, which became available for pre-order on Oct.18. It is the first phone released by the Taiwanese company’s Republic of Gamers (ROG) gaming hardware brand.

Another new feature is the ultrasonic “AirTriggers” — extra programmable touch points on the edges of the phone screen that serve the same function as game-controller buttons when held horizontally. (Physical game controllers can be attached to the sides of the phone.)', '“Games require certain controls, so we started to think about what we can offer to add in the controls people are accustomed to, but without adding all the extra complexity,” Lien said.', 'Asus is selling a variety of accessories for the phone that cost up to several hundred dollars each, including a “TwinView Dock” that adds another screen (for $399.99), a “Mobile Desktop Dock” that can connect the phone to a computer monitor in order to game with a mouse and keyboard (for $229.99).', '“A lot of gamers don’t game on one device only. It’s about this interoperability between their devices on the go and the device they use primarily in a stationary environment,” Lien said. “The ability to control their own gaming experience is one of the most appealing things about the ROG phone.”', 'These gaming phones are also differentiating themselves from Apple and Samsung with better cooling mechanisms and bigger batteries to allow prolonged playing time.', '“The ability to not overheat is really crucial to having a good gaming phone,” Swider said. “That is how Razer and other phone makers can rival an iPhone or a Samsung phone that obviously has more mainstream appeal right now.”', 'The Razer and ROG phones both use custom vapor chamber cooling technology to disperse heat from the chipset and sustain performance, with Razer adapting the thermal system used in its gaming laptops. Asus is even including an external “AeroActive Cooler” accessory that mounts on the side port.', 'For all their gaming-optimized features, these devices still need to handle all the regular smartphone needs as users carry them around, in order to gain any traction in the competitive phone market.', 'Razer incorporated feedback from its first phone to make the second generation more viable as a daily driver, including significantly improving the camera — a point of much criticism in the predecessor, brightening the screen for better outdoor use and adding wireless charging, an increasingly common mainstream feature.', 'But the gaming designs come at a cost in terms of bulkiness. “These are not thin and light gaming phones,” Swider said. “They are akin to gaming laptops, whereas the iPhone is more like a thin MacBook Air.”', 'Asus isn’t shy about marketing to the high-end gamer segment of the market and betting that these consumers will pay significantly more for accessories. “The phone still functions perfectly like a phone, but we wanted to be known as a gaming phone and not as an all-purpose phone that also does gaming,” Lien said.', 'The price point of the Razer and Asus ROG phones will create pressure from both above and below, according to Jeff Fieldhack, a research director at Counterpoint Technology Market Research. The Razer Phone 2 starts at $799 — $100 more than its predecessor — while the ROG Phone starts at $899, with the cooling accessory included. Both will have more expensive versions with extra storage available.', 'These prices are comparable with Apple and Android flagship phones, many of which have the same top line processor in the most recent models.', 'The phone market’s lower tier now includes models optimized for gaming with sufficient frame rates and audio quality and large displays. “These devices will not offer the most optimal gaming experience, but more importantly, they come in around $300 and can play games like PUBG, Honor of Kings, Doupo Cangqiong, Pokémon GO, etc., smoothly enough,” Fieldhack said via email.', 'The popularity of Chinese technology giant Tencent’s Honor of Kings, which has an estimated 200 million monthly players, and other mobile games have also fueled the rise of gaming phones from Chinese manufacturers around this price point, though few are available outside the price-sensitive Asian market.', 'Research firm Canalys estimates that the Razer phone shipped fewer than 100,000 units globally since it launched last November.', '“There are some things the Razer phone can do that the most recent Samsung and Apple flagships cannot,” Fieldhack said. “However, the faster refresh speed will not be enough for subscribers in the Galaxy or iPhone camp to ditch their ecosystem choice for a gaming phone.”', '—By Erica Yee, special to CNBC.com', 'WATCH: What happened when I tried to get an Apple iPhone 6 battery replaced']"

The International Energy Agency is aiming to increase the share of electric vehicles globally to 30% by 2030.', 'Chinese automakers Beijing Electric Vehicle and BYD, U.S. electric carmaker Tesla and Japan’s Nissan were the top producers. Together, they manufactured approximately 560,000 of the world’s fully electric cars.', 'Still, this number accounts for less than 1% of the one billion vehicles being driven today, according to statistics by BloombergNEF for the 2019 Electric Vehicle Outlook.', 'As greater importance is placed on reducing carbon emissions, more countries are providing incentives to build integrated infrastructure, and to encourage drivers to switch to electric vehicles.', 'Norway offers tax exemptions for electric car buyers — and 46% of automobiles in the country are electric. Shenzhen in China is one of the few cities equipped with a fleet of fully electric buses. Others like the U.S. and India have set targets to aid their countries to stay on track toward a carbon emission-free vehicle industry.', '“In countries around the world, where there is an over-arching commitment towards the environment, the city has been more than willing to provide the charging infrastructure,” Subodh Mhaisalkar, executive director for the Energy Research Institute at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, told CNBC.', 'It’s not just cars and buses becoming electric vehicles. Other modes of electric transportation, such as motorcycles, ships, and tuk-tuks — or Thai rickshaws, are also popping up.', 'However, we might still be a long way from reducing our carbon footprint, especially since 38% of the world’s electricity still comes from burning coal.', 'With more electric vehicles and charging stations being built, demand for electricity will also increase. According to projections by BloombergNEF, electric vehicles will cause global electricity consumption to rise 6.8% by 2040.', 'That’s not the only dilemma in the industry.', 'Harley-Davidson joins a growing list of companies struggling to find a foothold.', 'British appliance maker Dyson, known for household products like vacuum cleaners and bladeless fans, called off its electric car project in October.', 'Days later, Harley-Davidson halted production of its fully electric motorcycle, known as the LiveWire. The decision came after a problem with its charging mechanism was discovered, barely a year after the motorcycle’s debut.', 'Still, financial and technological difficulties might make it difficult for these traditional companies to make their forays into the electric industry.', 'Despite such challenges, there are more and more entrants and improving technologies every day.', 'The electric car market has paved the way for technological advancements in the skies as well.', 'Volocopter, in collaboration with helipad developer Skyports, aims to develop a commercial air taxi service in Singapore.', '“We are absolutely convinced that it’s going to be a meaningful way of moving around cities,” Duncan Walker, co-founder of Skyports told CNBC. “We see this very much as an integrated part of the transport network.”', 'Disrupting the multi-billion dollar auto industry will take time, but more and more countries are beginning to develop standard models for electric infrastructure.', 'It could be a long way more before electric vehicles finally go mainstream.']"
46,Buy a Sofa Online? Wayfair Is Counting on It,2017-10-16T09:11:00+0000,"['Early on a fall morning, the sweat was already beading on Sean Williams’s brow as he and his partner wrestled with a problem worthy of a geometry class: figuring out the series of lifts, tilts and tugs needed to squeeze a sectional sofa through the front door of a New Jersey home.', 'Just a few days earlier, Jeanne Korchak had found the perfect L-shaped sectional for her Fair Haven home from a website run by the online home furnishings giant . Now it was up to Mr. Williams to flawlessly deliver and assemble the sectional. A single rip or ding and Wayfair would wind up taking the furniture back.', 'After Mr. Williams declared he was done, Mrs. Korchak stepped into the room, her eyes zeroing in on a beige sofa cushion. “Is that a stain?” she asked. The room fell silent.', 'These days, ordering a shirt or a pair of shoes online and having them delivered to your home is easy. And while online grocery delivery may occasionally result in a broken egg or melted ice cream, it’s hardly the end of the world.', 'But ordering big, expensive furniture — a sofa, dining room table or mattress — online is a more complex challenge. Is that chair more teal or more turquoise? It’s hard to tell through the pixels. Do the cushions feel like you’re sitting on a cloud or on a boulder?', 'And that’s before the demanding task of delivery. Oversize couches meet small door frames. Fragile crystal chandeliers meet floors. Vanities are the bane of all deliverymen, managing to be both bulky, weighing hundreds of pounds, and delicate, with easily scratched or nicked tops.', 'This is the knotty space that Wayfair is trying to own.', 'This year, Boston-based Wayfair will sell around $4 billion worth of ceiling fans, dog beds, espresso machines, hot tubs and artificial Christmas trees (around 55,000 sold in the last 12 months) online. That’s nearly double what it sold two years ago and just a little less than the home furnishings giant , which owns Pottery Barn and West Elm.', 'It’s a growth story that has proved irresistible to Wall Street; Wayfair’s stock price has more than doubled this year, to $71.', 'But the big question hovering over Wayfair is whether the company can ever make money by delivering bulk furniture virtually for free. The company is expected to lose nearly $200 million this year and has been a favorite of short sellers, betting that the company’s stock price will fall.', 'Most major furniture retailers will charge at least $130 to deliver a couch. But Wayfair will ship or deliver any purchases costing $49 or more for free, bringing large pieces of furniture into the entrance of your home. (Taking the item to a specific room or assembling it costs extra.) And if the order is damaged or if the customer simply doesn’t like the color, Wayfair says, it will take the item back.', 'Noting that Wayfair’s profit margins are considerably less than those of its competitors and that  has signaled its interest in the space, some analysts argue that it may be difficult for Wayfair to produce profits. There has also been speculation in the industry that Amazon or  could acquire Wayfair.', '“It feels like 1999,” said Andrew Left, the executive editor of Citron Research, who has bet that Wayfair’s stock will fall. That was when the stocks of dot-coms and e-commerce firms soared, even though the vast majority were unprofitable.', 'Wayfair argues that the margins of its competitors, like Restoration Hardware or Williams-Sonoma, are higher because they are building extra profit into their pricing. A sofa from another company may start at $1,000, but Wayfair sells its sofas at an average price of $600, a spokeswoman said.', 'Wayfair also noted that its earnings in the United States before taxes and other expenses had been positive this year, and said its net losses were due to its investments in its international businesses.', 'Wayfair was founded by Niraj Shah and Steve Conine, friends and engineers who graduated from Cornell University in 1995. Within three years, the pair had sold their first company, an information technology consulting business, for $10 million.', 'But in 2002, as dot-coms collapsed, the two men noticed that small, specialized online retailers were still growing at a rapid clip.', '“One lady had a website selling birdhouses that she stored in the garage,” Mr. Shah said in an interview. “She was looking to sell her business because she couldn’t keep up with the demand.”', 'So the two men started racksandstands.com, a website selling, well, stands and racks for televisions. In its first four months, the site amassed $400,000 in sales.', 'By 2010, the company was an incongruous collection of 270 websites, from cookware.com to everygrandfatherclock.com to outdoorrugs.com. So Mr. Shah and Mr. Conine consolidated the sites under one digital umbrella, and ultimately called it Wayfair.', 'Today, sitting under that umbrella is a dizzying array of more than eight million products. The company offers 7,328 types of coffee tables, 106,430 different area rugs (20,073 of them blue) and 759 different standing coat racks.', 'To help customers wade through its virtual bazaar, Wayfair has some of its 1,000 software engineers constantly developing new features for its app. One allows consumers to snap a photo of an item, a couch or chair, that Wayfair then matches with products on its website. Another recently released feature produces a 3-D image of the Wayfair product, allowing consumers to see how a piece looks in a room and, perhaps more important, whether it will fit the room’s dimensions.', 'But many traditional retailers argue that furniture remains a category where consumers will be reluctant to buy solely online.', '“Having a real-world presence, we believe, is a competitive advantage,” said Marta Benson, the president of Pottery Barn.', 'While about half of the revenues for Williams-Sonoma come from online sales, Ms. Benson noted that plenty of customers “want to sit, touch and feel some categories before they purchase.”', 'Still, investors have rewarded Wayfair’s explosive growth since the company went public in 2014. With its soaring share price, Wayfair has a market capitalization of $6.2 billion. That’s $2 billion more than Williams-Sonoma’s valuation.', 'But a big difference is that Williams-Sonoma is profitable, making $300 million last year.', 'In an effort to bring down some of its costs, Wayfair has spent much of the past year changing its shipping and delivery models.', '“We’re bringing it in-house,” said Sharif Sleiman, Wayfair’s head of supply chain and operations as he strolled through one of two new warehouses that Wayfair has built just outside Princeton, N.J.', 'The combined warehouses — the size of 17 football fields, with racks that stretch 40 feet to the ceiling — hold some of Wayfair’s most popular smaller household items and furniture, from scrub brushes to lamps, that can be shipped throughout the Northeast on  or  trucks.', '“We’re able to deliver faster, within one or two days,” Mr. Sleiman said, “and we’re seeing less damage.”', 'More from The New York Times:', 'Executive Mentors Wanted. Only Millennials Need Apply.Amazon Turns on the Charm Amid Criticism From Right and LeftRichard Branson’s Virgin and Hyperloop One Transit Pods Become Fast Friends', 'But delivering the bigger pieces of furniture is much trickier. A year ago, all of the “last mile” warehouse facilities were run by third parties. But concerns about inconsistent customer service and damaged tables and beds prompted Wayfair to take over half of the facilities, trying to infuse a sense of teamwork and enthusiasm among its workers.', '“Is there anything else I can do for you?” shouted a group of two dozen deliverymen standing in a Wayfair warehouse in Linden, N.J., about 10 miles south of Newark, at 4:38 on a recent morning.', '“Louder,” the team leader demanded.', 'A few minutes later, the group broke up, allowing Sean Williams and the other drivers to check their deliveries and routes for the day.', 'Mr. Williams and the others are employed by a third-party freight delivery firm, but Wayfair puts the drivers through extensive customer training, shows them how to handle fragile items and gives them bonuses for good customer feedback.', 'Mr. Williams’s first delivery that morning — dropping off and assembling a cocktail table — went smoothly. But in Fair Haven, he hit a snag with the sectional sofa.', 'On this day, at least, Wayfair escaped the fate of returned furniture. A few dabs with a baby wipe and the mark on the cushion disappeared.', 'Mrs. Korchak declared that she was pleased with her purchase, and, about 30 minutes after he had arrived, Mr. Williams pulled the truck out, headed for his next delivery.']"
47,Risks are rising for an oil price spike as tensions between the U.S. and Iran increase,2019-05-15T21:08:05+0000,"['If not for the trade war, both oil and gasoline prices could be much higher than they are now on rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran.', 'Analysts say oil could be more than 10% higher, but if there is a resolution of trade issues, and the situation in the Middle East intensifies, there are risks of price spikes that take oil to as high as $100 a barrel this summer.', '“If you do get a trade war resolution, a better economy coupled with Iran sanctions, that’s a recipe for higher oil,” said Francisco Blanch, head of global commodities and derivatives at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Blanch said under that scenario, one incident could trigger a spike in Brent, the international benchmark, to $100 a barrel.', '', '“I think the real risk is Iran misreads [President Donald] Trump and Trump misreads Iran. I do think the real risks are increasing for sure,” said Blanch. His forecast is for Brent to reach $82 per barrel during the summer.', 'West Texas Intermediate futures are flat this week at just around $62 per barrel and down 2.2% for the month so far, even though the U.S. has sent an aircraft carrier and bombers to the Gulf due to unspecified threats, which U.S. officials say are the work of Iran.', 'The U.S. Wednesday ordered all non-emergency diplomatic staff to leave Iraq, after two separate attacks in the region and as the U.S. responds to other nonspecific threats. This week, two Saudi tankers were among four ships attacked off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, and Houthi rebels, who have ties to Iran, claimed responsibility for a separate drone attack on a key Saudi Arabian pipeline.', 'While it’s not clear Iran was involved, analysts expect more such incidents.', '“Senior Iranian officials have made veiled and not-so-veiled threats to obstruct the ability of its regional rivals to export oil and exponentially raise the economic costs of remaining on the current policy course. They have also warned of ‘planned accidents’ which could lead to direct confrontation,” notes Helima Croft, global head of commodities strategy at RBC.', 'The Houthi, operating from Yemen, have previously attempted attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure. Saudi Arabia and Iran are engaged in a proxy war in Yemen. Iran also provides funding for Hezbollah, a Lebanon based group designated as terrorists by the U.S.', 'The Saudi Aramco oil pipeline was temporarily closed after the drone incident. It is a 1,200 mile oil artery the Saudis built to bypass the Straits of Hormuz during the Iran-Iraq war.', 'Croft said the presence of the U.S. Fifth Fleet in Bahrain would likely discourage Iran from trying to close the Straits of Hormuz, though it could could use its proxies and stage one-off attacks on ships.', '“It is important to note that these are not the only flash points in the region, and while an off-ramp may yet emerge, the hawks appear in ascendancy, which leaves oil’s risk premium set to take center stage,” she noted.', 'Croft said while the Trump administration has not blamed Iran in the attacks this week, they are “under a very heavy cloud of suspicion and there is growing concern that the region’s long simmering cold war may be poised to become a hot one.”', 'John Kilduff of Again Capital, said that scenario is one side of the tug of war on oil prices.', '“The battle in the oil market is the geopolitical premium versus the slowing global economy, which is the fallout from the trade war,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital “WTI would be pressing $70, and Brent would probably push on $80 to $85.” Brent futures were just under $72 per barrel.', 'But those prices have not moved much higher in last few weeks, even as it became clear the U.S. would play hardball with Iran and pressure its oil sales to zero. It’s been a year since the U.S. dropped out of the agreement between Iran and six nations, which prohibited Iran from working on its nuclear program in exchange for a lifting of sanctions. The U.S. is the only nation to break from the agreement.', 'Iran has threatened to restart elements of its nuclear program, unless the European signatories of the accord help allow it to make oil sales.', '“Historically, with this kind of tension in the Gulf, there would definitely be a security premium in the price. We haven’t seen it this time—so far,” said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit. “The two big reasons are the trade war, and its potential effect on economic activity and the huge growth in U.S. supply.”', 'Yergin said U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has made it clear when speaking to oil industry leaders that the boom in U.S. oil production has helped give the U.S. flexibility.', '“This is a case study of how the growth in shale, and the change in the U.S. position affects perceptions about security,” said Yergin. In the past year, the U.S. has surged past Russia to be the world’s largest oil producer. Last week, U.S. oil production was at 12.1 million barrels a day, while exports surged to 3.3 million barrels a day.', '“You have this firewall of U.S. output,” said Kilduff. “The Saudis can really turn the spigot on at will. There’s a lot of cushion as we go into this situation with Iran.” Saudi Arabia and OPEC, have been attempting to keep the oil market in balance under an agreement with Russia and other non-OPEC producers. The joint monitoring committee for that group meets this week.', '“There was chatter in the market that this weekend, they could agree to raise the production cap to respond to the loss of Iranian crude,” he said. Analyst said Iran exports have already fallen below 1 million barrels a day and it could drop more, to as little as 200,000 barrels a day.', 'Analysts say the potential for more incidents in the Gulf is increasing, as Iran gets more desperate and its economy gets weaker under U.S. sanctions.', 'President Donald Trump this week denied reports that the U.S. was considering sending as many 120,000 troops to the Middle East to deal with Iran. But he added if troops were necessary, he’d send “a hell of a lot more.” Trump’s advisers, however, are seen as more hawkish than the president, and it was his national security adviser John Bolton, former U.N. Ambassador, who advised President George W. Bush in the war against Iraq.', '“It’s a flammable situation and with lots of room for miscues and miscalculations,” said Yergin.', 'Blanch said Iran has several options, including dropping out of the nuclear agreement, but the most likely is that Iran will take indirect actions through proxies.', '“There’s no sense they’re going to come back to the negotiating table,” said Blanch. “Iran could see being more proactive against U.S. aggression, for the home audience. At the end of the day, the loss of market share for Iran is a gain for the rest of the region. Other than letting others pocket money for the barrels you no longer can sell, you could target those barrels and maybe in the process push the price up and put some pressure on the Trump administration which doesn’t want to see higher gasoline prices. It’s a fine line to walk.”', 'Kilduff said the market is more on edge, even if prices aren’t rising.', '“Because of the maximum pressure campaign the U.S. is putting on Iran, there’s little doubt the Iranians will try to act out through proxies in the areas. We’re tripping into conflict. That’s the sense in the market,” said Kilduff.']"
48,Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks with CNBC’s Jim Cramer: Full transcript,2019-01-08T23:35:44+0000,"['Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke with CNBC’s Jim Cramer Tuesday about the company’s big initiatives as it tries to recover from a negative start to the year after it warned investors of weak revenue and iPhone sales for its first quarter 2019. As of Tuesday’s close, Apple’s stock was down 4.4 percent year to date.', 'In the interview, which airs on “Mad Money” at 6 p.m. ET Tuesday, Cook shares why he is optimistic about Apple’s future as well as trade negotiations in China. He also addresses the legal battle between Apple and Qualcomm and predicts that Apple’s legacy will ultimately center around its innovations in healthcare.', 'The full transcript from the interview is below. This transcript has been lightly edited for style and clarity.', 'JIM CRAMER: Tim, you know I always say, “Own it, don’t trade it.” But right now, people are saying, “Jim, give me the investment case for buying the stock.”', 'TIM COOK: Well, you know, I never try to sell a stock. I try to sell a product.', 'CRAMER: Never have.', 'COOK: However, let me tell you the way I look at it. We manage the company for the long term. The most important things in Apple, one, a culture of innovation. This team is unbelievable in creating hardware and software and services and getting them all to work together. It just works.', 'Second, we have a very large active install base. It hit 1.3 billion a year ago, and we’ve added about 100 million in the last 12 months. Third, highest customer satisfaction and loyalty in the industry. So you put those two things together, if you got a lot of a big, active install base, and you got a lot of heavy customers, then you have a recurring revenue stream on your product business.', 'And then because of our ecosystem that we built, which has unbelievable developers in it and an app store to get services out there, we built a services business that was, you know, a little over $7 billion in 2010. Last year for the calendar year, over $41 billion. And we’ve said that, you know, we’re gonna double the 2016 numbers by 2020.', 'And so we’re on a fast clip there. And then, of course, we are shareholder friendly on our capital allocation. So you put all these things together, and those are the most important things for us: innovation, customer satisfaction, and the overall size and loyalty of our customers.', 'CRAMER: Okay, so most tech companies, I think, don’t innovate nearly as much as you. But let me just posit what we got. You take so many risks that I don’t think you get credit for. For instance we had what turned to be ridiculous strings around our neck, and then we got the AirPods.', 'We loved our dumb watch that told time, and now we have a smart watch that saves our lives. We loved the big, fat jack, and then we got the lightning jack. We loved our Sony, $2,000, mirrorless camera, until we got the iPhone X, which takes better pictures. Why do you, therefore, have a 12 multiple? Because to me, that is wrong.', 'COOK: Yeah, I think it’s wrong, too. But I tell you what I focus on is the customer. And so the customers speak every quarter. They speak every year. They speak every day. And the most important thing for us is that they’re satisfied. And so when I read the emails and so forth from customers, they’re telling me how the Apple Watch has changed their life.', 'They’re telling me how it motivated them to be more fit, be more active. They’re telling me that they discovered that they had AFib. (Atrial fibrillation.) They’re telling me they found a problem with their heart that they didn’t know existed and if they wouldn’t’ve reached out to a doctor, they might’ve died.', 'And so these are life-changing things. We’ve got machine learning embedded in our silicon in our phone. You know, this allows us not only the power efficiency to have an incredible performance in a very small package, but it allows us to manipulate this data on the phone, have the transactions on the phone, as opposed to letting them out in the world.', 'The whole privacy issue for — we’ve always been on the right side of privacy. But the market is now moving. And so this is an incredible strength that we’ve built. The photos that you’re able to take with your phone, as you said, I mean, these are life-changing things, if you like to chronicle your life. This morning, I picked up my phone and I saw a memory from a year ago —', 'CRAMER: I love the memory thing.', 'COOK: I love it, you know? I see my nephew or somebody that’s very important to you. And their face just appears. And you have a slideshow built for you. These things, they’re unbelievable. And our customers love them. And that’s the most-important thing.', 'CRAMER: But okay, so let’s unpack that. My daughter has the 5. Why? ’Cause she loves it. She said, “Listen, Dad. If you put it in the washing machine, like your wife did, I’ll get a new one. But you can’t (COOK LAUGHS) pry it outta my cold, dead hands, ’cause I love it.” She is not an upgrader, because you made the greatest product. What do we do about that? What do you do?', 'COOK: Well, the most important thing, for me, is that she’s happy. That is the most important thing. Now, if she’s not upgrading for another reason, maybe it’s too much of a hassle for her to upgrade. Maybe she’s worried about the transfer of data.', 'All of this stuff, we wanna help on. And do you know, we’ve got the store that you’re in that’s very focused on having the best customer experience there, helping people set up their new phone, making sure all their data’s transferred, and also-- allowing them to trade in their current phone, which begins to look like a subsidy that the carrier may have previously provided. And it offsets some of the cost of the new phone.', 'CRAMER: Okay, so these issues are all occurring at the same time that we do have China. You were very abject about China and the 100 percent of the upside that went away. There are issues involving perhaps, not boycotts, we know that’s off the table, but patriotism, in a strange way, meaning that, you know what? If I can get a Huawei with a subsidy, why should I buy an Apple that’s conspicuously American. How long can that last?', 'COOK: Well, I think here’s what we saw in China in specifically. The Chinese economy, it seemed to us, began to slow, maybe, in the second half of the year. And it was on some sort of rational trajectory. We believe, based on what we saw and the timing of it, that the tension, the trade-war tension with the U.S. created this more-sharp downturn.', 'I believe that’s temporary. Because I think that, when you really look at it, it’s in both countries’ best interests to come to an agreement. It is a complex, very complex trade agreement. And it needs to be updated. But as I’ve said before, I’m very optimistic that this will happen. And so that clearly will be good, not only for us, frankly, but I think more about the world in general. The world needs a strong U.S. and China economy for the world economy to be strong.', 'CRAMER: My understanding is even the hardliners in the White House have moved on this issue. Now I know that President [Donald] Trump calls you a friend, I know that you go back and forth because you’re represent the greatest that we have in America. And my understanding is that there are people who feel exactly like you, which means a deal’s possible.', 'COOK: I think a deal is very possible. And I’ve heard some very encouraging words.', 'CRAMER: Even of recent, right?', 'COOK: Yes, yes, very recently. And I don’t speak for them, obviously. I do talk with them. And I give them my ideas and thoughts.', 'CRAMER: Okay, now, we gotta talk about some of these people who, the naysayers. And we’ve dealt with them before, when the stock was substantially lower. A Wedbush analyst said Apple’s clearly the darkest days, representing a challenge in growth. Journal, It’s too soon to call the XR a flop, only after a few months. But early indications are, of course, it’s a flop. What do you say to people who say XR flopped? What do you say to, say, darkest days?', 'COOK: I say bologna. I call bologna on that. Let me tell you how I view this. Here’s the truth, what the facts are. Since we began shipping the iPhone XR, it has been the most popular iPhone every day, every single day, from when we started shipping, until now.', 'CRAMER: But how about relatively? I mean, there’s been other ones that have —', 'COOK: I mean, do I want to sell more? Of course I do. Of course I’d like to sell more. And we’re working on that. But in terms of the product itself, it’s an incredibly innovative product. It has a bunch of advanced technologies in it from the chip with the neural engine to security embedded to an edge-to-edge liquid retina display, the first in the industry, longest battery life ever in an iPhone.', 'I mean, it is unbelievable. And the photos that you can take of your life and of your loved ones, I mean, it beats many, many of the standalone cameras that you could buy now that nobody uses anymore. And so these things give a lot of value to the customer. So that’s that.', 'In terms of the naysayer, I’ve heard this over and over again, Jim. I’ve heard it in 2001. I’ve heard it in 2005 and ’07 and ‘08 and ‘10 and ‘12 and ’13. You can probably find the same quotes from the same people over and over again. And I’m not defensive on it. This is America. And you can say what you want. But I’m giving you my honest opinion is that there is a culture of innovation in Apple. And that culture of innovation, combined with these incredible-- loyal customers, happy customers, this ecosystem, this virtuous ecosystem, is something that is probably underappreciated.', 'CRAMER: Well, then you were surprised with the market reaction to both when you decided to not reveal units and when you revealed the shortfall.', 'COOK: I’m never surprised by the market, to be honest with you. Because I think the market is quite emotional in the short term. And we sorta look through all of that. We think about the long term. And so when I look at the long-term health of the company, it has never been better.', 'The product pipeline has never been better. The ecosystem has never been stronger. The services are on a tear. If you look at, let’s just take wearables as an example, right? Wearables, it’s mainly the Apple Watch and AirPods.', 'If you look at this, and on a trailing basis. I’m not projecting. On a trailing basis, they’ve we’ve already exceeded the revenue for wearables is already more than 50 percent more than iPod was at its peak. Now, this is a product that I think everybody would say it was an incredibly important product for Apple, full of innovation, and probably, the trigger for the company getting on a very different trajectory and into other markets.', 'And so already, exceeded it by 50 percent at its peak. At its peak. Also, if you take AirPods and the Watch separately, and you sort of back these up and align it to the launch date of iPod, as well, and, you know, where all of them have a comparable amount of time, you would find that each one, independently, is, like, four to six times ahead of where iPod was at a comparable period of time.', 'And so AirPods are becoming ubiquitous out there. People love them. I get notes every day. They’re chock full of tech. But they just work. It’s the elegance of them, but with significant technology and built right in and an unbelievable user interface.', '[Break]', 'CRAMER: I’ve been following stocks for 40 years, Tim. And you guys are a fountain of innovation. My wife said, “Tell him, what do they want? Time travel?” (LAUGHTER) What do you have to do?', 'COOK: Hey, time travel sounds kinda cool.', 'CRAMER: Right? The reason I mention it is because there are companies that sell at 22 to 23 times earnings, they are the consumer packaged goods companies. There are companies that tend to go from 1 to 4 percent. If they get 5%, then they get a 28 multiple.', 'And yet, the analysts who follow your company continue to look for units of phones, they’re not thinking about the revenue. And yet, if it were Procter & Gamble, and they got that many razor blades, they’d pay 28 times earnings. Are you followed by the wrong people?', 'COOK: I think that our story isn’t well understood. I think Apple is not well understood in some of Wall Street. For example, I think there are several people that believe the most important metric is how many iPhones are sold in a given 90-day period or what the revenues is.', 'This is far, far, far down my list. The point is, if somebody decides to buy an iPhone a little later, because of the battery, huge discount that we gave, they decide to hold on a little longer, I’m I’m great with that.', 'I want the customer to be happy. We work for them. And so the important thing is that they’re happy. Because if they’re happy, they will eventually replace that product with another.

It also could be a supply-chain nightmare to U.S. businesses, since the L.A./Long Beach port complex handles more than 30 percent of loaded containers that move through all U.S. ports.', '“As a state, California is probably one of the better-prepared places on Earth in terms of preparation for earthquakes,” said Mary Comerio, past president of the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute and a University of California-Berkeley professor specializing in disaster recovery and reconstruction. “That said, financially these things are huge hits now.”', 'Mexico City’s 7.1-magnitude quake on Sept. 21 toppled buildings, damaged public infrastructure and killed more than 220 people. It was four times stronger than the 6.7-magnitude Northridge earthquake in 1994, a Los Angeles-area disaster along a previously undetected fault that took more than 60 lives and caused about $44 billion in damage.', '“The Northridge earthquake was considered to be moderate,” said Robert de Groot, a staff scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey field office in Pasadena, California. “For California, our big earthquakes are typically in the high magnitude 7s.”', 'According to the USGS scientist, a 180-mile rupture along the southern portion of the state’s San Andreas Fault could produce the “Big One,” a 7.8-magnitude earthquake. He said it would be felt “pretty widely throughout the state” and even as far as Las Vegas but “the worst shaking will be in the Los Angeles basin.”', '“We are expecting a very large earthquake on the San Andreas Fault,” de Groot said. “We don’t know when this earthquake will take place, but it’s a very good candidate as a place where a big earthquake will happen eventually.”', 'A spokesperson for AIR Worldwide told CNBC the catastrophe-modeling firm conducted an earthquake model analysis and found simulated events impacting California could result in “upwards of $300 billion in total ground-up losses to properties.”', 'An analysis by CoreLogic, a global data analytics firm, specifically looked at a large quake along the San Andreas Fault and in November estimated it could impact the northern and southern portions of California simultaneously. CoreLogic said an earthquake of magnitude 8.3 along the feared fault could result in a full rupture and damage up to 3.5 million homes, resulting in reconstruction cost values of $289 billion.', 'By comparison, CoreLogic estimated Hurricane Irma and Harvey damage would run in the tens of billions of dollars. Most of the property estimated to be damaged by flood is uninsured.', 'In California, only about 10 percent of the homeowners have earthquake insurance. ', 'On average, big quakes happen on segments of the San Andreas statewide roughly every 150 years, but parts of the fault system in the south near L.A. have not had a rupture for over 300 years.', 'For Southern California, a significant quake could damage infrastructure at the ports as well as airports. That could result in a ripple effect not only on the state’s economy but on the nation’s since major retailers, manufacturers and others rely on the L.A.-area ports to stay in business.', 'Additionally, rail lines that carry the goods from ports, as well as the highways and bridges that the trucks use, could suffer devastating damage in a big quake and take weeks or months to repair.', '“We could be up and running here after a major quake and have all of our ships coming in and going, but there could be a problem with rail or highways that doesn’t allow the goods to leave the port or get to the port,” said Phillip Sanfield, a spokesman for the Port of Los Angeles, the nation’s largest port complex.', 'Parts of the cargo terminals and harbor facilities of the L.A.-area port complex are built on artificial landfills and areas with known seismic activity. As the ports have increased volumes and cargo ship sizes over the years, they have outgrown existing spaces and been forced to create new land.', 'The shaking on areas with land reclamation increases the liquefaction potential and ground failure when loose or water-saturated soils shake. Indeed, the huge 9.0-magnitude earthquake in Japan in 2011 caused major liquefaction on reclaimed land in Tokyo.', '“We’re very cognizant of the fact that we’re in an earthquake-prone region,” said Duane Kenagy, interim deputy executive director of the Port of Long Beach. He said standards have been developed over the years for the engineering and construction of the port facilities that take into consideration the location and seismic risk.', 'If there was damage from a significant quake to the L.A. port complex, though, they could attempt to move ships to other terminals or even divert vessels to other West Coast ports, such as Oakland.', 'Other infrastructure also is at risk, and an earthquake could have lasting effects.', 'There’s the potential for natural gas and water lines to break, which is what happened during the Northridge quake. The broken gas lines could create thousands of fires that could overwhelm emergency responders after a major temblor.', 'Another frightening possibility is an earthquake could cut off a major water supply for L.A. and other parts of Southern California, where more than 23 million people live. The region gets about 70 percent of its water delivered through three aqueducts that cross the San Andreas Fault, and a study by the L.A. Mayor’s Office several years ago revealed that a 7.8-magnitude quake could cripple that water supply for 15 months.', 'There’s also concern about the stability of levees in Northern California that form the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, the hub of the state water system that provides water to about 25 million Californians and to millions of acres of agriculture in the Central Valley. San Francisco Bay and Silicon Valley areas of the state also could be affected since they draw on that water from the delta.', 'The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, a water wholesaler for nearly 19 million people, uses the Colorado River Aqueduct and said it could recover in six months from a disruption if there’s a big quake on the southern portion of the San Andreas fault. Chief Engineer Gordon Johnson said MWD has a reservoir it built in the late 1990s that carries a six-month emergency supply of water for Southern California and there are also groundwater basins to tap into during a water emergency.', 'Finally, a major earthquake in California could trigger tsunamis and makes heavily populated areas along the coast especially vulnerable. The threat of a tsunami isn’t limited to the southern half of the state since Northern California includes part of the 680-mile long Cascadia fault capable of megaquakes of magnitude 9.0.']"

The Trump administration is making it a priority to assure U.S. companies scoop up a significant share of the business.', 'In May, the U.S. Commerce Department and Beijing reached an agreement that will allow Chinese firms to strike long-term contracts with American producers of liquefied natural gas.', 'U.S. capacity to process LNG, or natural gas cooled to liquid form, is set to grow nearly seven-fold by 2019 as five export terminals open. Exporting more of that LNG is a central pillar of Trump’s plan to achieve “energy dominance.”', 'The United States will have to compete with Qatar, Malaysia and Australia, which dominate global LNG sales, as well as Russia, which ships gas to China by way of pipeline. But there are signs that there’s room for American suppliers in the fastest-growing market for LNG.', '', 'American LNG shipments to China are rising this year, according to a report from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. The U.S. shipped $139 million of LNG to China in the first seven months of this year. That tops last year’s total U.S. LNG exports to China of $137 million.', 'The opportunity exists because U.S. transport costs to Asia are low right now, and Asian LNG prices have fallen to the weakest level in more than a decade.', 'That is encouraging China to buy natural gas instead of coal. China’s five-year economic plan calls for the country to use less coal and more natural gas to generate power. Despite the recent gains and the agreement with Trump, Chinese buyers are still only purchasing U.S. LNG from third parties in short-term spot trades. And there is currently only one company, Cheniere Energy, capable of exporting large shipments of LNG from the United States.', 'Cheniere CEO Jack Fusco and Texas LNG Chief Operating Officer Langtry Meyer are joining the Trump delegation. The companies did not respond to questions about their agenda in China, but energy research firm Wood Mackenzie said securing commitments is likely at the top of Trump’s list.', '', '“The fact that Trump will arrive in Beijing with a large business delegation in tow, including a sizeable contingent from the energy sector, indicates that the White House is looking to secure concrete commercial agreements from the upcoming trip,” Kerry-Anne Shanks, head of Asia gas and LNG at Wood Mackenzie, said in an email briefing on Tuesday.', 'Chinese natural gas demand could grow from 206 billion cubic meters last year to 330 billion cubic meters in 2020, according to Wood Mackenzie. The firm expects LNG to account for about a third of China’s growing consumption through 2025.', 'The United States has faced some obstacles but also boasts advantages in capturing part of that growth.', 'On the one hand, Chinese LNG buyers can potentially find a better deal elsewhere and may not want to expose themselves to U.S. gas prices, said Hugo Brennan, Asia analyst at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft. There are also large fixed costs to liquefying and shipping LNG from the United States, and American companies will have to contend with lower-cost LNG expansions in Qatar and Australia, Brennan added. Shortly after the Commerce Department reached the agreement with China, Qatar announced plans to hike its natural gas exports 30 percent by 2024. Some analysts think China won’t end up buying much LNG from the United States and will instead use the option to gain leverage over Qatar in price negotiations.', '', 'But U.S. LNG shippers can offer customers more flexibility in terms of shipment volumes, and American deals have allowed buyers to sell off their purchases to others, Brennan notes.', '“China aims to maintain a well-diversified portfolio of gas suppliers and U.S. imports could help ensure that Beijing does not become too dependent on any one state. U.S. supplies could help reduce China’s reliance on gas imports that transit strategic chokepoints,” Brennan said in a note on Tuesday.', 'Wood Mackenzie also flags growing cooperation between China and Russia, which can send natural gas to its southern neighbor through pipelines at a discount to U.S. overseas shipments.', 'Despite the existence of latent pressure points, Sino-Russian ties have warmed considerably under Xi Jinping and there is a deal of synergy between Moscow’s ‘Pivot to Asia’ and Beijing’s ‘Belt and Road Initiative,’” the firm says. “Energy cooperation has developed into the central plank of the bilateral relationship.”', 'Supply from China itself could also be an obstacle. China has the world’s largest technically recoverable reserves of shale gas, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

53,How Russian gas became Europe’s most divisive commodity,2018-07-17T18:28:21+0000,"['Lubmin is a picturesque resort on Germany’s Baltic Sea coast that boasts a long stretch of sandy beach bordered by soft dunes and a lush pine forest. Located a few hours north of Berlin, the town offers tourists a postcard version of seaside tranquility. Or it would, were it not for the fleet of excavator barges that sails out from the local port every day, and the large building site hiding behind the pines.', 'Both are part of a fiercely contentious project that has split Europe down the middle, and set Germany on a collision course with some of its closest allies. Out in the sea, the excavator barges are digging a massive underwater trench that runs in a straight line towards the building site on land. If all goes to plan, that trench will soon hold a pipeline filled with the most explosive commodity in European politics today: Russian gas.', 'The Nord Stream 2 pipeline has been in planning since 2015, and is due for completion in late 2019. Its defenders argue the project makes perfect commercial sense: the pipeline will connect the world’s biggest exporter of natural gas with the largest economy in Europe, doubling the capacity of the existing trans-Baltic link, Nord Stream 1, which has been operational since 2011. Together, the two pipelines will eventually be able to carry 110bn cubic meters a year of natural gas, enough to meet almost a quarter of total demand across the EU.', 'Critics regard the pipeline — and Germany’s role in it — as an act of betrayal and a geopolitical folly of the first order. Countries such as Poland and Ukraine have denounced it as a blatant attempt to marginalize their own gas pipelines — and a reckless move that will leave them and the rest of Europe at the mercy of Moscow. The European Commission is another opponent of Nord Stream, arguing the project undermines its push for greater energy independence and more diversified supplies.', 'The most formidable adversary, however, sits in Washington. President Donald Trump has made clear repeatedly that he wants to stop the €9.5bn ($11,071,775,000 US) project — and that he is ready to impose tough sanctions to achieve that goal. Last week, Mr. Trump launched a blistering attack on the new pipeline at the Nato summit in Brussels, warning that Germany had become “captive to Russia, because it’s getting so much of its energy from Russia.”', 'Kirsten Westphal, an energy analyst at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, likens Nord Stream 2 to an “onion” — you peel away layer after layer of controversy only to discover that the next one is more contentious still. At its core, however, the pipeline poses a simple but crucial question: should the west trust Russia or not?', '“Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the war in Ukraine have changed everything,” says Ms. Westphal. “For many people in the west, the idea that Russia is a dependable partner has gone. There is doubt: given all the geopolitical tensions, should we further expand our energy relationship with Russia? Should we make a bet, despite it all, to keep the channel open?”', 'For reasons of history as well as naked economic self-interest, that question tends to find a different answer in Germany than in other European countries and the US. It is summed up neatly by Axel Vogt, the mayor of Lubmin and — like most locals — an enthusiastic backer of Nord Stream. “For us, Russia has always been a reliable business partner. And we don’t see any sign that this is changing despite all that is happening on the big political stage,” he says. “For Lubmin, Nord Stream means jobs, it means contracts for local businesses and it means more business taxes,” the mayor says.', 'He adds that this affection for Russia goes beyond economic gain, and reflects ties forged in the time when Lubmin was part of communist East Germany. “Before reunification there was a very close relationship with Russia . . . and they want it to stay that way.”', 'For now the project enjoys the official support of the German government (as well as the unconditional backing of the Kremlin). But the chorus of critics in Berlin, including inside the government, is growing ever louder.', '“Nord Stream 2 has divided the EU, and that cannot be in Germany’s national interest,” says Norbert Röttgen, a senior member of parliament for the ruling Christian Democratic Union. “The most important role that Germany has is to bring Europe together, not to divide it. But without Germany, this division would not exist.”', 'Earlier this year, German chancellor Angela Merkel signalled a subtle but important shift in official rhetoric. Nord Stream 2, she said, was “not just an economic project”. Political factors also had to be considered, she added, not least the need to preserve Ukraine’s status as a transit country for Russian gas. Kiev earns as much as $3bn in transit fees a year, according to Naftogaz, Ukraine’s state gas company, money the embattled government badly needs. The gas link also acts as motivation for the two countries to keep their military and political conflict from spinning out of control. When the gas stops flowing — as it did, briefly, in 2006 and 2009 — both sides stand to lose.', 'After meeting his US counterpart on Monday Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president said Moscow was willing to “extend this transit contract if the dispute between [Gazprom and Naftogaz] is settled.”', 'Yet circumventing the Ukrainian network is precisely what Nord Stream is about, as Russian officials have made clear. The new pipeline will allow Russia to cut out the middleman for much of its westbound gas shipments — and to avoid the kind of disputes over payments and conditions with Kiev that have flared up in recent years. The fact that Ukraine’s pipelines are in urgent need of repair and investment provides an additional incentive.', 'For the Russian-European consortium that is bearing the cost of the project, Nord Stream 2 is, above all, a promising investment. Unlike Nord Stream 1, which was a genuine Russian-European joint venture, the new pipeline will be owned entirely by Gazprom, the Russian gas group that controls Russia’s pipeline exports. Half the financing, however, is provided by five European companies: Uniper and Wintershall of Germany, Austria’s OMV, Engie of France and Royal Dutch Shell.', 'Nord Stream’s backers are making a simple bet with potentially huge rewards. They know the pipeline will come on stream in 2019 just as supplies of European gas from the North Sea are starting to dwindle. The consortium estimates that even if overall gas demand is stable or declines slightly over the coming two decades, Europe will have to find an additional 120bn cubic metres a year of natural gas by 2035. That gap will be filled by shipping large volumes of liquefied natural gas from countries such as Qatar and the US, or through pipelines from Russia.', 'The looming gas shortfall has sparked a rush to build infrastructure, as suppliers jostle for position. Not far from Lubmin, on the other side of the Polish border, stands one of several new LNG terminals that have popped up on Europe’s coastline in recent years. Most are working well below capacity, reflecting the fact that pipeline gas is as much as 25 per cent cheaper than LNG.', 'Some German business leaders and officials suspect that this is one of the core reasons for the opposition to Nord Stream 2. The US, they say, is simply trying to boost the commercial prospects of LNG. That was the central complaint in an open letter signed by a cross-party alliance of senior German lawmakers earlier this year.', '“It is not the job of the EU to keep potential competitors off the backs of US companies that want to market their . . . natural gas in Europe,” it said. “American liquid gas is welcome on the European gas market, but it has to face the competition just like others.”', 'Why should German and European consumers and companies pay a premium for non-Russian gas? The obvious answer, say critics, is politics. Moscow, they argue, is engaged in a broad campaign to split the western alliance, destabilize European democracies and reassert Moscow’s influence in eastern Europe and the Baltics. One of the most potent weapons in that campaign is Russia’s control over energy resources — and Europe’s dependency on them. Concern over what might happen if Russia turns off the taps has weighed heavily on European minds for years. Nord Stream 2 will make those concerns even more acute.', '“Last year, Germany received slightly more than 40 percent of its gas supplies from Gazprom. If we now double the capacity by way of Nord Stream 2, we will see another significant increase in supplies from Russia,” says Mr. Röttgen. “I believe this pushes us into a danger zone, both in terms of energy policy and foreign policy. We will lose some of our independence.”', 'There is, he adds, another consideration: “The whole Putin system rests on two pillars: the military and the export of energy resources. By stabilising that second pillar, Germany is also stabilising the Putin regime.”', 'Gazprom says that given that its newer gasfields are in Russia’s north-west, Nord Stream 2 will save 2,100km of transit compared with the Ukrainian route, and cut emissions by 61 per cent.', 'Russia has also warned that US threats against it are illegal. “We believe that any sanctions against companies involved in an international project would not be legal,” Mr. Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said this month. “This is an exclusively international, commercial project devoid of any political motives, based on the principles of commercial gain for the countries that participate in it.”', 'The geopolitical case against Nord Stream 2 is made with particular intensity in eastern European capitals such as Warsaw, where fears over a Russian-German carve-up have a strong historical resonance. That sentiment was expressed in blunt terms by Radoslav Sikorski, the former Polish foreign minister, who likened the Nord Stream project to the 1939 deal between Hitler and Stalin to divide eastern Europe.', 'In Berlin, however, officials prefer to point to a different historical antecedent: the Ostpolitik of Willy Brandt, the German chancellor who pushed for rapprochement with the Soviet bloc in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In economic terms, the policy gave rise to a “gas-for-pipes” deal between West Germany and the Soviet Union. Against fierce US opposition, the Germans agreed to ship steel and pipes to the USSR, in exchange for natural gas imports.', 'The first Russian gas arrived in Germany in 1973, and imports rose steadily in the decades that followed, undisturbed by the cold war. For supporters of Nord Stream 2, that experience holds a crucial lesson. They see the gas relationship not as one of western dependence on Russia, but of mutual dependence between buyer and seller. Moscow needs western payments as much as the west needs Russian gas.', '“I see Nord Stream as a stabilising factor for the relationship between Russia and the West,” says Matthias Platzeck, a former leader of Germany’s Social Democratic party and now the president of the German-Russian Forum, a Berlin-based association designed to foster bilateral ties. “Even at the high point of the cold war the Russians always delivered their gas. Why should that change now? After all, they need the money.”', 'As the political argument continues to rage, the project itself is making steady progress. Over the past two years, the consortium has amassed vast stockpiles of concrete-coated steel tubes, and deposited them at various points on the Baltic Sea. A few weeks from now, workers will begin welding the 12-metre-long pieces together at sea and lowering them into the water. With much of the investment already made, and all but one regulatory permit for the project granted, even critics admit that it will be hard to stop it now.', 'As long as the project does not hit fresh political and technical turbulence, Gazprom is planning to open the taps at the Russian end of the 1,200km long pipeline in late 2019. The impact at the other end, however, is already being felt.', '“In commercial terms, there is a case to be made for Nord Stream 2,” says Ms. Westphal. “In political terms, however, it is clear that Germany will pay a heavy price.”', 'More from the Financial Times:', 'Ireland to become first country to divest from fossil fuels', 'EU court upholds UK Hinkley Point subsidies', 'Brussels launches investigation against Qatar Petroleum']"

It’s complicated, analysts say",2019-09-27T06:15:38+0000,"['Russia and China appear to be increasing their economic, political and military ties amid poor relations with the West. But the relationship is far more nuanced than it first appears with strengths and weaknesses on both sides, experts note.', 'While U.S. trade relations with China have soured, as each slap billions of dollars’ worth of tariffs on each other’s goods, trade relations between China and Russia are blossoming. Chinese President Xi Jinping even called Russian President Vladimir Putin his “best friend” in an uncharacteristic display of warm relations during a state visit to Russia this summer.', 'Xi also promised Putin that China was “ready to go hand in hand with you” and the leaders signed statements committing to “the development of strategic cooperation and comprehensive partnership” between their nations and “strengthening strategic stability (which) includes international issues of mutual interest, as well as issues of global strategic stability.”', 'Strengthening economic ties is a large part of warm Sino-Russia relations. Last week, Russian and Chinese news agencies reported that the two countries want to double their trade over the next five years, to $200 billion by 2024 — up from $107 billion worth of trade in 2018 — by implementing joint projects in fields of energy, industry and agriculture.', 'Despite making vows to increase bilateral trade, the economic relationship between Russia and China is not a marriage of equals. The International Monetary Fund expects Russia’s economy to grow 1.2% in 2019; China, meanwhile, is expected to 6.3%.', 'It’s no surprise then that Russia sees China as a massive growth market at a time when its trade with western nations is sorely restricted. Russia is still subject to economic sanctions for its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, as well as interference in the 2016 U.S. election and the nerve agent poisoning of a former double agent in the U.K.', 'With that in mind, it makes sense that Russia is seeking an economic — and geopolitical — partner and ally to the East.', 'Their pledge to increase trade comes amid “a bifurcation in the U.S. and China’s spheres of influence,” Cailin Birch, global economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC Thursday.', '“Obviously, the U.S. and China have no love lost between them and it would make much more sense for Russia to seek to build ties with this massive emerging market which will be a source of growth, in the way that the U.S. won’t be going forward, and with whom they don’t have the same political conflicts, and that presents a lot more opportunities to the Russian market for Russian energy products and developing their economic ties,” she noted.', 'For China, a partner like Russia that would “set the U.S. slightly ill at ease would be hugely beneficial,” she added.', 'Russia also has something that China needs in abundance – energy. Russia is among the world’s top three producers of oil and natural gas whereas China is the second largest crude oil importer in the world.', '“China is the main source of new energy consumption for fossil fuels particularly, and having a strong partner on its doorstep that’s ramping up its production of crude oil, the fabrication of LNG (liquefied natural gas) and the shipping of that all around the world, would also be beneficial to China,” Birch said.', 'Security and defense is another area where Russia and China have ostensibly sought to build ties and experts agree that Russia has more practical military experience than China. Just last week, China’s ‘People’s Liberation Army’ was one of seven foreign forces (including India and Pakistan) invited to join Russia’s “Tsentr 2019” massive military drills that took place across a swathe of Russia.', 'It was the second year China has participated, and its continued involvement is seen as significant by experts like Richard Weitz, senior fellow and director of the Center for Political-Military Analysis at the Hudson Institute.', '“Chinese and Russian national security communities share common objectives that can be promoted through further cooperation, such as border security, military technology development, and counterterrorism,” he told CNBC on Monday.', '“They also perceive threats from U.S. and allied positions and policies that they can cooperate to thwart, such as U.S. missile defenses and Western military intervention in regional hotspots. They conversely see opportunities to expand their influence at the expense of the United States, including by undermining U.S. bilateral and multilateral alliances.”', 'The old adage that “my enemy’s enemy is my friend” could be applied currently when it comes to China and Russia’s relationship with the U.S. right now. Sino-U.S. relations are currently more acrimonious than those between Russia and the U.S, given the lack of resolution to the trade dispute,.', 'For China, President Trump’s decision to up-end the status quo when it came to Sino-U.S. trade — because of what he has seen as unfair trade practices — and to impose billions of dollars’ worth of tariffs on Chinese imports as a result, has dented its economic growth and potential.', 'Against this backdrop, boosting Sino-Russia bilateral trade could open a door to growth for both Moscow and Beijing as lawmakers and officials confront trade barriers like sanctions and imports tariffs elsewhere.', '“There’s a growing consensus that a partnership between Russia and China is quite a powerful force, led by China rather than Russia, but that between the two of them they could represent quite a powerful bloc and I think the U.S. is growing increasingly concerned by that,” the EIU’s Birch noted.', 'She added that “Russia would be the junior partner based on size of market and its prospect for growth so obviously in that sense, Russia would be pulled into China’s sway slightly.”', 'Experts say the scales have tipped in favor of China being the dominant partner in Sino-Russian relationship and that has injected rivalry into the dynamic which is restricting cooperation on an economic and security level.', '“It looks like they’re cooperating, it looks like it’s all nice and rosy in Russia-China relations in military terms - but it’s not,” Mathieu Boulegue, research fellow of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House, said.', 'Speaking at a briefing ahead of the military drills involving China, Boulegue said Russia’s message to China when it involved it in its war games last week was “not about cooperation.” “The message that Russia is sending to China is actually quite the opposite if you look at the deep meaning behind it.”', '“It’s about matching Chinese interests in the region because Central Asia right now is a new battleground for influence, not just on the economic side but it’s very much about the growing Chinese influence in the military and security sphere.”', 'Raffaello Pantucci, director of International Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), also said the relationship between Russia and China was mainly a “utilitarian” one and their alliance shouldn’t be overplayed by analysts.', '“What does China-Russia think, how will Russia-China react? – they do have different interests and the danger is that we over-exaggerate this strategic alliance. It’s one that has limitations and questions,” he told CNBC Monday', 'Nonetheless, the U.S. will likely be watching the Sino-Russia alliance, particularly in terms of defense, carefully especially given the recent breakdown of its own long-standing nuclear arms treaty with Russia.

As Marvel prepares to release the 22nd film in its cinematic universe, its movies have already earned $18.5 billion at the global box office. “Avengers: Endgame,” a major climactic event, is setting records for advance ticket sales, and fans are already asking for more.', 'Warner Bros. has released only six films in the DC Extended Universe since 2013, and they have garnered just under $5 billion. “Shazam,” a lighthearted popcorn flick that opens Friday, will be the seventh.', 'Estimates for the film have been set low, about $50 million for the weekend’s haul, but expectations are high. The film currently has a 92 percent “Fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes, a good sign ahead of its opening.', 'More importantly, “Shazam” is a chance for DC to continue to build on its recent successes with “Wonder Woman” and “Aquaman.” It spins the tale of a young teenager who transforms into an adult superhero when he shouts the name “Shazam” — think “Superman” meets “Big.”', 'Trailers for “Shazam” have been bright and packed with humor, something DC’s universe has been sorely lacking. In the last six years, DC’s wave of superhero films have been dark, droll and disappointing to fans.', 'If it succeeds, it will cement the idea that audiences are more willing to open up their wallets when Warner Bros. strays from the Marvel strategy of continuity between films and embraces its more unique — and even obscure — characters.', '“They have a formula that’s working,” said Brock Bagby, executive vice president at B&B Theatres. “If they continue that, they’ll gain even more loyalty. Just like Marvel, [DC] has to be consistent if it wants to be highly successful.”', 'Warner Bros. has a long history with superhero films, particularly from DC. It distributed the original Superman flicks starring Christopher Reeve in the late ’70s and ‘80s. It also distributed a number of Batman films — from Adam West’s take in 1966 to the days of Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney donning the cowl in the ’80s and ’90s.', 'Although considered by some today to be campy classics, these films paved the way for the modern superhero film. As audiences became more sophisticated, so too did Warner Bros.′ comic book content. In the mid-2000s, the production company greenlighted Christopher Nolan’s gritty standalone Batman trilogy, which was well-received by critics and audiences alike and took in more than $2.46 billion at the global box office between 2005 and 2012.', 'It did not quite see the same success with its reboot of Superman in 2006. “Superman Returns” earned only $391 million worldwide and was so widely panned that Warner Bros. scrapped any possibility of a sequel.', 'The success of Nolan’s Dark Knight Trilogy inspired a darker retelling of Superman’s origin in the form of 2013′s “Man of Steel” from director Zach Snyder. While the film was ripped apart by critics for turning the optimistic superhuman boy scout into a brooding antihero, it made nearly $700 million globally, guaranteeing a second installment.', 'By the time “Man of Steel” hit theaters, however, Marvel Studios had already cranked out six films. This included the blockbuster “Avengers” flick, which grossed a whopping $1.5 billion at the global box office, according to Comscore data.', '“This was years in the making,” Paul Dergarabedian, senior analyst at Comscore, said. “Marvel was not an overnight success. Marvel had these building blocks where they literally created something that audiences were intrigued by and then got hooked on and had to follow.”', 'Marvel had spent the years between 2008 and 2012 laying the groundwork for a massive team-up film. It took a chance on the then-uninsurable Robert Downey Jr. to take on the role of Iron Man, aka billionaire Tony Stark, a B-side Marvel hero so low in status that most non-comic book fans associated “Iron Man” with a Black Sabbath song of the same name.', 'Over the course of four years, Marvel introduced audiences to the Hulk, Thor and Captain America in standalone features that incorporated several secondary characters such as Black Widow and Nick Fury. The films were praised for how they weaved together humor and drama.', 'Marvel, which was acquired by Disney in 2009, proved that audiences were not only hungry for superhero films, but would show up in droves to see their favorite characters work together to defeat a common enemy.', '“Kevin Feige has been the mastermind. Even though they’ve had a bunch of writers and directors, they still had one guy overseeing the whole thing,” Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice, said of Marvel.', 'In a rush to keep up with the rampant success of Marvel, Warner Bros. used Superman’s sequel film to introduce Ben Affleck as an older Batman and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, two key members of the Justice League. The goal was to quickly establish these characters so that the production company could release a “Justice League” film.', '“Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice” was the team-up movie that comic book lovers had longed to see for decades. The caped crusader from Gotham and the Man of Steel had never appeared in a live-action adaptation together before this film’s release in 2016. Fans raced to theaters opening weekend, shelling out $420 million worldwide during its debut to see the spectacle. However, reviews were sour, and ticket sales during the film’s second weekend shrunk 70 percent.', '“If you chase what another entity is doing, that doesn’t really work,” Dergarabedian said.', 'He noted that it was the brand-name characters — Superman and Batman — that drove a lot of the ticket demand. The film itself was not quite as beloved as its comic book stars. The film ultimately grossed $873 million worldwide, according to Comscore data.', '“Marvel has always understood that it is first and foremost about characters,” said Alisha Grauso, editorial lead at ticketing site Atom Tickets. “We are in an age now where we are very character-driven, and the fact that DC veered away from the fundamental core of its characters, I don’t think that worked.”', 'Warner Bros.′ “Suicide Squad” brought together a team of famous and infamous DC comic book super villains who were more endearing than their hero counterparts. However, a shoddy story arc and thin character development earned it a 27 percent Rotten Tomatoes score. Still, the film earned $746 million globally.', '“Wonder Woman” was a breath of fresh air for the franchise in 2017. The film, lighter in aesthetic and tone, resonated well with moviegoers. Idealistic Diana, an Amazon from the mythical Themyscira, was charming, and fans were eager to root for her. The first female-centric superhero film on the big screen was directed by Patty Jenkins and hauled in $821 million.', '″[Wonder Woman] is a really beloved character,” Grauso said. “Warner Bros. got the character right with Diana’s compassion and her strength ... it was the first movie that they really took the time to craft the character.”', 'However, the praise for Warner Bros. would fade before the end of the year. “Justice League” hit theaters less than six months after “Wonder Woman,” and the reception was lackluster, to say the least. Murky visuals, weak storytelling and poor chemistry between the major characters earned the film a 40 percent Rotten Tomatoes score.', 'The film earned $657 million at the global box office, less than half of 2012′s “Avengers” haul.', 'The dark tones and palate that worked for Batman don’t work for a bigger universe, said Jonathan Gray, professor of English and popular culture at John Jay College and CUNY Graduate Center. Warner Bros.′ biggest misstep came from trying to shoehorn lighter, more optimistic characters such as Flash, Superman and Wonder Woman into that gritty setting.', '“That’s where they went wrong,” he said. “You look at Superman, who is tonally the opposite of Batman. He’s hopeful where Batman is pessimistic. He’s light where Batman is dark. But when you look at the Zach Snyder Superman movies, they are Batman movies. They are dark and pessimistic, and that for me was the problem.”', 'From 2013 to 2017, the DC Extended Universe films made $3.7 billion, a huge feat for Warner Bros. However, none of its films had grossed more than $1 billion until “Aquaman.” While some called the film and its CGI “cheesy,” for the most part, it was well-received for Jason Momoa’s charisma and its action-packed but playful script.', 'Currently, there is no official word on whether a “Justice League” sequel will be coming to theaters, but if one is on the docket it probably won’t show up anytime soon. Henry Cavill will no longer don the cape as Superman, and Affleck has hung up his cowl.', 'Ezra Miller, who played the Flash in “Justice League,” made a bid in March to pen the script for a Flash film to ensure that he could stay on as the speedy Barry Allen in his own feature film.', 'And it is unclear if Cyborg, another hero from “Justice League,” will find his way to the big screen.', '“There is some fatigue on Batman and Superman, but there’s such a deep vault of superheroes and villains that have been untapped with DC,” Bagby said. “There’s tons of potential.”', 'Looking at Warner Bros.′ slate, one thing is clear: It’s course correcting.', '“DC has had a different style, a different tone, following the Dark Knight Trilogy,” Dergarabedian said. “Now it’s about learning from what fans liked or didn’t like from previous films. I think they really have a handle on what they need to do.”', 'After “Shazam,” there will be the much-anticipated standalone “Joker” film, starring Joaquin Phoenix, in October. The film deviates from the comics by focusing on Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian who is driven insane and, thus, turns to a life of crime in 1981 Gotham City. The film is expected to be dark and psychological, just like the Clown Prince of Crime himself.', 'Joker Tweet', '“Warner Bros. is realizing they don’t necessarily need the Justice League right now because individual characters and stories not tied to a massive interwoven cinematic universe can still do well at the box office and with moviegoers,” said Erik Davis, managing editor at Fandango.', '“By focusing more on character than building out a universe, Warner Bros. isn’t beholden to a larger story — instead, the studio can focus on telling one great story one film at a time, and then develop additional stories depending on what fans want to see more of,” he said.', 'Margot Robbie’s take on Harley Quinn in “Suicide Squad” was so well-received by fans that she’s slated to reprise the role in three more feature films due out over the next few years. She’ll be seen alongside a rogues’ gallery of characters from the DC universe in “Birds of Prey,” “Suicide Squad 2” and “Gotham City Sirens.”', 'In 2020, fans will get a new Wonder Woman film. Although Jenkins returns to direct, it won’t be a sequel. “Wonder Woman 1984” will link back to 2017′s “Wonder Woman” in some fashion, showing what Diana has been up to in the 40 years since we last saw her, but it’s a standalone film.', 'In the works is also a standalone Batman film directed by Matt Reeves, an “Aquaman” sequel and an “Aquaman” spinoff film called “The Trench.”', '“The biggest indicator that Warner Bros. is turning the ship around is the critical reviews and fan reaction,” Grauso said. “For Warner Bros. money is always important, but more than anything, it’s about rebuilding trust in the brand.”', 'Disclosure: Comcast, the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC, owns Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes.']"

It’s the same software that ships on Apple’s new iPhones, which arrive in stores on Friday.', 'Don’t worry: Apple didn’t change so much that it’ll make using your iPhone feel too much different.', 'Instead, it added new features that continue to build on what you’re already familiar with. There’s dark mode, for example, which you can turn on or off (or schedule to turn on automatically at night), that’s easier on your eyes at night. It also just looks cooler than the bright theme you might be used to.', 'My favorite feature is the new Photos app. It really brings a lot of your camera roll of pictures to life. Live photos and videos animate in a new “Days” tab, for example, but you can also now easily sort by month or year to quickly find life highlights. Videos or panoramas, or subjects Apple thinks are important, will pop up as larger thumbnails (as you can see in the picture below.) And speaking of photos, Portrait pictures, the ones that let you blur the background to make it look like it was taken by a professional photographer, now let you adjust the amount of blur in the background, which is perfect if you think Apple’s software overdid it.', 'In tandem with the launch of Apple Arcade, the company’s $5/month premium game service that gives you unlimited access to a large library of exclusive games, iOS 13 also supports Bluetooth Xbox One and PS4 controllers. I tested this and loved using it, particularly to stream games from my PlayStation 4. But here I am just playing a game from the App Store on my iPhone with an Xbox One controller:', 'Another new feature that’s included, but which I haven’t tried yet, is called “Sign in with Apple.” This will let you automatically sign in to apps using your Apple ID. It’s sort of like the option you might already see for signing in with your Facebook or Google account, but Sign in with Apple lets you give the app a random email address so that developers don’t have your real one if you don’t want them to.', 'Speaking of security, Apple will also warn you when an app is using your location or Bluetooth, how often it’s doing so, and if you want to continue granting that app access. Companies like Facebook are already fighting back.', 'Apple Maps has also been totally redesigned, but that redesign hasn’t been completed for the entire U.S. and will roll out over time. You’ll see new features like “Collections” that let you store your favorite places, a new feature called “Look Around” that’s like Google’s Street View (though this isn’t everywhere yet, either), real time public transit schedules, flight status information and a new CarPlay interface that looks less cluttered than earlier versions of CarPlay and is easier to navigate.', 'There’s a lot more in iOS 13, like the ability to let Siri read text messages to your AirPods, new Memoji, a built-in swipe keyboard and more. Despite these, you may want to wait until Sept. 24 to update to iOS 13.1, which will fix some early bugs in iOS 13 and add even more features. Still, I’ve been using iOS 13 for the past several weeks with only a few issues, so you should be safe.', 'iOS 13 works with all phones newer than the iPhone 6s and iPhone SE as well as 7th generation iPod touch. iPads are also getting an update with lots of these new features, but it’s called iPadOS this year.', 'To update your iPhone to iOS 13, just do this:', 'Your iPhone will check for an update and, if it sees it (sometimes it might take a bit if the servers are slammed by other people looking for it), you’ll download it.', 'Follow @CNBCtech on Twitter for the latest tech product news.']"

It’s  unclear how many of the new submarines would be created, but the  Navy’s current submarine fleet stands at just over 50 and had  been projected to fall to 41 boats in 2029, according to  the Congressional Research Service.', '  As for carriers, the Navy has 10 in service and the $13 billion USS Gerald Ford will soon joining the  others. “We believe the U.S. should have 13 carriers to meet our  security obligations,” said Tom Spoehr, a retired Army lieutenant  general and director of the Heritage Foundation’s Center for  National Defense.', ' More aircraft: Trump’s Air Force would  consist of at least 1,200 fighters, up from the present  1,113.

Other partners on the F-35 program are Northrop and BAE  Systems.', '  “If you pull the plug on that (F-35 program) it’s going to be 15  years before we have something else to put in its place,” said  David Ochmanek, senior defense research analyst at the RAND think  tank and a former deputy assistant secretary of defense in two  presidential administrations. “That would be a  seismic thing to disrupt.”', ' More troops: Trump’s Army would consist of  around 540,000 active-duty troops, a figure he indicated the  Army’s chief of staff has sought. “We now have only 31 brigade  combat teams, or 490,000 troops, and only one-third of combat  teams are considered combat-ready,” Trump said in September.', '  The Marine Corps also would be expanded under the Trump plan,  going from 23 battalions today to 36, or around 10,000 more  Marines. That’s a figure the billionaire said the Heritage  Foundation indicated was the minimum number needed to comfortably  “deal with major contingencies.”', '  “The funding increases would pay for soldiers and not equipment,  and would therefore be of minor benefit to hardware  manufacturers,” said Credit Suisse analyst Robert Spingarn.', '  Still, the analyst believes there’s some upside for larger  munitions firms such as General Dynamics and Orbital ATK, as well  as for missile companies such as Lockheed, Raytheon and Boeing.', '  Trump also pledged in his Philadelphia address that he would  “seek to develop a state-of-the-art missile defense system” and  modernize the Navy’s cruisers with ballistic missile defense  capability.

This could help IT and cyber-related government service companies such as Booz Allen Hamilton, ManTech and Science Applications International.', 'Trump also indicated that one of his first directives after taking office will be to ask the Joint Chiefs of Staff and some other departments to conduct reviews of cyberdefense capabilities for the purpose of identifying all vulnerabilities.', 'Burden sharing: Another defense issue Trump has  addressed several times is the desire to have allies share more  of the financial burden for security rather than American  taxpayers. The U.S. has various treaties such as NATO and  arrangements with Asian countries that provide for help against  possible aggression.', 'Yet some believe the current arrangement of helping with weapons  sales may actually reward the U.S. with economies of scale. Raytheon is considered one of the most exposed major defense contractors in terms of international military business.', '“These same agreements allow for sales of major weapons systems  which lowers the average cost to the U.S. military,” said Howard  Rubel, a defense industry analyst at Jefferies. “Based on current  rhetoric, the new administration does not understand this subtle  benefit, nor the benefit of interoperable weapons from radios to  warplanes.”']"

But when it comes to one of society’s biggest challenges, dealing with climate change, the online giant has not been seen as a corporate leader. That is beginning to change.', 'Amazon recently announced its Shipment Zero goal, under which the company aims to have 50 percent of all deliveries reach net zero carbon emissions by 2030. Amazon also is finally tracking its carbon footprint and for the first time will release a carbon report this year. It’s a type of climate change disclosure that has become more common among major corporations but which the Jeff Bezos-led company has long resisted.', '“Amazon has not been a leader when it comes to disclosing its carbon footprint,” said Sue Reid, vice president of climate and energy for Ceres, a nonprofit that advocates investors and companies to tackle sustainability issues like climate change.', 'True to form, Amazon is going its own way with the climate report. Rather than releasing its findings to the CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project — an organization that collects data from major companies every year and compiles it into what the nonprofit claims to be the most comprehensive collection of self-reported environmental information — Amazon is developing its own approach to tracking and reporting carbon emissions.', 'Amazon would not disclose how it plans to achieve net zero status or report its carbon emissions beyond its blog post.', 'Reid is willing to give Amazon the benefit of the doubt. “The disclosure element, the commitment of the company to disclose later this year what it says has taken a couple of years’ worth of data to get its arms around, is a huge piece of the equation of what investors are looking for to show that companies are taking climate change seriously.”', 'So are other investors, who have been pressuring corporations for years.', 'Tim Smith, director of environmental, social and governance shareowner engagement at Walden Asset Management, said CDP is an important tool that investors use, but it isn’t the only part of the litmus test. “The most important is huge companies, whether Walmart or Amazon, saying they are committed to moving in this direction. ... When one of the largest companies is saying the issue is real and human activity causes it and here is what we will do, it is exceedingly important and they deserve credit,” Smith said.', 'Reid said Ceres will be keeping a close eye on Amazon’s in-house methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions and how comparable it is to organizations like the CDP. “It’s really important it be transparent with how they’ve done their math and comparable to other disclosures so investors can look at how Amazon compares to the other companies in their portfolio,” she said.', 'Other experts are concerned Amazon’s self-reported carbon emission report won’t measure up.', '“If you are doing such a fantastic job, you would join something like the CDP, which is a verified, structured system that allows us to understand what you’re doing and to benchmark your performance against your peers,” said Aseem Prakash, director of the Center for Environmental Politics at the University of Washington.', 'Last year slightly over 7,000 companies disclosed their carbon footprints with the CDP. When combined, the reporting companies represented over 50 percent of the total global market capitalization, according to the CDP website.', 'UPS received an A from the CDP in 2018; DHL received an A-; FedEx received a B. Since 2010 the only grade from the CDP that Amazon has received is an F — for non-participation.', 'Prakash said Amazon has yet to disclose its carbon footprint because there has been a lack of pressure, from both customers and investors, for the company to do so. “The single most important issue is return on investment,” Prakash said. That is changing as Amazon faces pressure not just from investors but its own employees.', 'Last year, 16 Amazon employees who owned stock in the company filed a shareholder resolution requesting Amazon’s Board of Directors prepare a public report describing how the company is planning for disruptions posed by climate change, and how they plan to reduce the company’s fossil fuel dependence. The resolution was pointed: “Amazon is both affected by and contributing to climate change,” the report stated.', '“I think we have to add pressure, we have to encourage them, and it can be positive,” Prakash said of Amazon’s recent steps in the right direction. “You have to have a situation where no deed goes unpunished, good or bad.”', 'Reporting carbon emissions is a good first step, but proactively changing a business to be carbon-neutral is a far larger challenge.', 'Amazon has invested in a massive wind farm in Texas, solar farms in four other states, and launched a frustration-free packaging program last year aimed at eliminating waste through the supply chain. But experts have long shown concern about Amazon’s secrecy surrounding carbon emissions, and even as it begins to more directly deal with climate issues, skepticism remains.', 'But a recent Greenpeace report contended Amazon Web Services — among other technology companies with data center businesses that are energy-intensive and growing rapidly with the boom in cloud computing — has been opaque when it comes to publicly reporting its current energy use and how fast it’s growing, although the company has committed to operating its global infrastructure at 100 percent renewable energy.', '“Companies have improved their climate accounting in recent years, but there remains a high level of uncertainty, particularly in supply chains,” said Suzanne Greene, who manages the Sustainable Supply Chains program at the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics. “When you have highly uncertain numbers, it’s difficult to make sustainable business decisions, such as choosing a greener carrier, or to know if you’re reaching your climate goals.”', 'Still, she provided some measured support. “We’ve been waiting for Amazon to join the sustainability movement, so it’s great news to have them make an announcement like this, even if it’s unclear if they’ve used the industry standard to set their target” Greene said.', 'Amazon’s Shipment Zero comes after major logistics companies already set plans to reduce carbon emissions.', 'UPS has the goal of sourcing 40 percent of its ground fuel from low-carbon or alternative fuels and to achieve a 12 percent reduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions across its global ground operations by 2025. DHL is expanding its fleet of electric vehicle delivery vans, which will use electricity or natural gas and clean diesel as an effort to reach its long-term goal of reducing logistics-related emissions to net zero by 2050.', 'To be totally net zero carbon, or carbon neutral, means a company would remove or reduce the same amount of greenhouse gas it is estimated to produce. The Amazon Shipment Zero goal of making 50 percent of its shipments to customers net-zero carbon by 2030 is possible because of improvements in electric vehicles, aviation biofuels, reusable packaging, and renewable energy, the company said in a blog post making the announcement. It declined to provide further comment.', 'Greene said it’s unclear if delivery to customers is the only part of their operations and supply chain that will be included in the reduction target. Amazon already uses hydrogen-fuel forklifts in warehouses and when it comes to small vehicles and vans, Greene agrees the industry has seen improvements delivering packages to customers. It’s the long-distance portion of the supply chain, which uses big semi-trucks running on diesel rather than electric or other cleaner solutions, that still needs improving.', 'Amazon recently led a $700 million investment round in the electric truck start-up Rivian as the company looks to change its delivery methods, and some industry experts have speculated that Amazon could use Rivian’s trucks for its global logistics needs.', '“Green technologies do exist, but even when they are ready to go, think about how long it will take to adopt these solutions at a greater scale,” Greene said. “There are millions and millions of trucks on the planet, and electric vehicles and trucks are going to be crazy expensive, plus there’s the question of where you charge them. Long-distance transport is far from ready.”', 'A prevalent method companies undertake toward reducing carbon emissions is through carbon offsetting, which requires calculating a company’s greenhouse gas emissions and spending money elsewhere to reduce them, such as methane captures from landfills, tree planting, and investing in solar and wind farms.', 'Greene argues there are currently no carbon offsetting projects that are specifically related to reducing emissions in the transportation sector, and it’s even more important that the methodology Amazon uses to calculate that figure aligns with others in their industry. Since Amazon subcontracts companies like UPS, FedEx and DHL to deliver its packages, transparency on carbon emissions down the supply chain is critical, Greene said.', 'Initiatives like the Global Logistics Emissions Council Framework and the Science-Based Targets initiative are two sources helping companies develop common reporting methods, Greene added.', 'Americans’ belief in climate change has been rising, with 71 percent of Americans saying that global warming is happening, and 50 percent saying they will be personally harmed by the effects of global warming, according to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.', 'Reid said Amazon’s commitment to disclose its carbon footprint is a huge piece of the equation for investors with whom Ceres works on factoring climate change into the valuation of a company.', 'Ceres is also a founding partner organization of Climate Action 100+, which is an investor initiative started in 2017 to hold some of the largest greenhouse gas emitting companies accountable by improving governance, curbing emissions and strengthening climate-related financial disclosures. The initiative is comprised of more than 320 investors who hold $33 trillion in assets under management, and 100 of the largest corporate emitters they target account for two-thirds of annual global industrial emissions. Walden Asset Management also is a member.', '“The elements related to customers and employees are really key here,” Reid said. “Investors are super attuned to the reputational element of climate leadership. That builds value, it builds loyalty with employees who want to see their company take climate change seriously.”', 'Walden’s Smith said that Amazon has historically been “more insular” than other companies and taken a position that they seem to think they “don’t need to talk to investors” but they face as many if not more shareholder resolutions than any other company this year and they are responding. “They’ve made the commitment to measure it and manage it, and I am quite confident,” but he added, “The challenge for them will be how to do it.”', 'Google may have the same issue as Amazon when it comes to increasing build-outs of data centers that are energy hogs, but investing in wind and solar farms to power these operations is easier than figuring out a carbon solution for a global logistics operation.', '“They don’t want to make pledge they can’t honor,” Smith said. “For investors, while disclosure is very important, disclosure requests have become much more pointed and specific. Investors are much more likely to be asking for the specific steps to change rather than just disclosing [a carbon footprint]. If [Amazon] is moving on the issue and really being proactive, they really need to not only be actively looking at the data themselves but asking, ‘what are we going to do and what are our public goals?’”', 'WATCH:\ufeff Jeff Bezos is so much bigger than Amazon — a look at his extraordinary empire']"

Ideas on how to accomplish this goal are three-fold according to Sohbet Karbuz, director of the hydrocarbons division, Mediterranean Energy Observatory: 1) to build a massive EastMed pipeline to ship natural gas from Israel and Cyprus to the EU through Greece and Italy; 2) develop an LNG plant to liquefy the gas and then ship it to Europe, or 3) a combination of both.', '“The dream was that the discovery of gas in the Eastern Mediterranean would bring cooperation and peace in the region. The reality is that it may trigger more disputes,” Euthymius Petrou, former advisor to the Greek Ministry of Defense and expert on Turkish affairs told CNBC.', 'So far no international energy company has expressed interest in investing and supporting the EastMed gas pipeline project.
