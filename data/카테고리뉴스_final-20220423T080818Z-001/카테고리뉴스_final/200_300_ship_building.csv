0,Old Hummer plant now builds China-bound Mercedes SUVs,2015-08-11T17:07:21+0000,"['  Lamar Ashford has been waiting a long time to see  this.', '  Five years after General  Motors shut down production of the Hummer at the AM General  assembly plant in Mishawaka, Indiana, the assembly line that once  built the H2 is cranking out another SUV.', '  This time, it’s the Mercedes-Benz R Class.', '  “With this R series coming in, it is good for the community, good  for everyone’s family,” said Ashford, who has worked 14 years for  AM General.', '  Mercedes-Benz has contracted AM General to build the R Class  because the luxury automaker no longer has the space to build the  SUV at its plant in Vance, Alabama.  ', '  That plant, where Mercedes manufactures most of its SUVs, is  running at close to capacity. To keep up with demand, the German  automaker is cranking up production of popular models like the  GLK and M Class.  ', '  So it’s moved production of the R Class to northwest Indiana and  hired AM General to build models that will be shipped to China,  the only market where the SUV is sold.  ', '  Demand for SUVs in China has been strong, but the market overall  is pulling back.', '  On Tuesday, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers  said retail sales of passenger vehicles dropped 6.6 percent in  July. It was the third time in four months auto sales have  dropped in China, the world’s largest auto market. In addition,  China on Tuesday devalued its currency by nearly 2 percent, a move that  could cut Chinese luxury consumption.', '  But Mercedes-Benz is confident it can ride out any impact the  devaluation action in China may have on its business.', '  “Let’s wait and see what happens,” said Jason Hoff of Mercedes-Benz. “You know we do a lot of hedging too. We protect  ourselves obviously for different currency changes so we will  just have to wait and see. But so far it has been a good year for  us.”', '  AM General President Howard Glaser maintains his  enthusiasm.', '  After five long years, the R Class is helping Mishawaka heal from  losing the Hummer.', '  “We are not just focused on the past, the Hummer and the H2. We  are looking to the future, we are looking to the front windshield  not the rearview mirror and we think it is going to be a great  ride,” said Glaser.', '  Mercedes’ hiring AM General to build the R Class is the latest  sign automakers are close to running at peak capacity.', '  After cutting U.S. auto production to 5.6 million vehicles in  2009, the auto industry has staged a huge recovery.  ', '  According to the consulting firm LMC Automotive, which tracks  auto production around the world,  U.S. auto plants will  build more than 11.8 million vehicles this year.', '  “We are seeing some pretty serious capacity constraints,” said  Jeff Schuster, senior vice president for forecasting with LMC  Automotive. “There are a few places where automakers have some  room, but in many plants they are pushing capacity.”', '  Right now, U.S. auto plants are utilizing 93 percent of their  capacity, with some plants running over 100 percent, according to  LMC.', '  “We’re seeing some plants where they have added weekend shifts or  they’ve increased the line speed in order to squeeze out a few  more vehicles,” said Schuster.', '  At the AM General facility in Mishawaka, there’s plenty of  capacity, and a skilled workforce ready to build the R Class.', '  Eventually, several hundred more workers are expected to be hired  as R Class production ramps up.', '  For Ashford, it’s welcome news that eases the pain of losing the  Hummer during the recession. “We were just ready to get back into  the plant. We love to work here,” he said.', ' Questions? Comments? BehindTheWheel@cnbc.com.']"

As a starting point, these fuels were “probably two to three times … much more expensive,” Skou said.', '“But we’re looking at this over a 20 year horizon and therefore, we think that the inflationary impact will be very modest when it comes out to the consumer.”', '“As an example, we are spending around $400 per container on fuels today,” Skou said. “If it triples we need to spend another $800 per container.”', '“That’s of course a lot, but … inside the container you have 8,000 pairs of sneakers, for instance, so it’s 10 cents per pair of sneakers. So that’s why I think … for the consumer, it will be manageable.”', 'According to the International Energy Agency, international shipping — a crucial cog in the world’s economy — was responsible for approximately 2% of “global energy-related CO2 emissions in 2020.”', 'With concerns about sustainability mounting and major economies and businesses around the world looking to cut emissions and meet net-zero targets, the sector will need to find new ways of reducing the environmental footprint of its operations.', 'Back in August, Maersk said it was ordering a number of large, ocean-going vessels able to run on what it called “carbon neutral methanol.” The firm said the vessels would be built by South Korea’s Hyundai Heavy Industries and have the capacity to carry around 16,000 containers.', 'Maersk said the ships would have a dual fuel engine set up, a feature which increases costs.', '“Additional capital expenditure … for the dual fuel capability, which enables operation on methanol as well as conventional low Sulphur fuel, will be in the range of 10-15% of the total price,” it said.', 'Shipping is not unique in attempting to find more sustainable ways of powering operations. In aviation, for example, a lot of discussions have taken place about the potential of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF.', 'Last October the CEO of Ryanair, Michael O’Leary, acknowledged the need for ambitious sustainable aviation fuel targets but also expressed concerns about how food prices could be affected.', 'During a discussion at CNBC’s “Sustainable Future Forum,” O’Leary said his firm was investing “a lot of money” with Trinity College Dublin on research into SAF.  ', 'In April 2021, the two organizations launched a sustainable aviation research center backed by a 1.5 million euro ($1.72 million) donation from the airline. As well as focusing on SAF, the center will look at noise mapping and zero-carbon propulsion systems for aircraft.', 'Ryanair has itself set a target of powering 12.5% of its flights with SAF by the year 2030. But speaking to CNBC’s Steve Sedgwick, O’Leary said he thought it was “a very ambitious target — I’m not sure we’ll get there.” ', 'He went on to articulate his feelings about the wider effects of increasing SAF usage. “I do worry over the longer term, though, on sustainable aviation fuels … what’s that going to do to food prices going forward?”', '“I think we’re going to reach a point in the next 10 or 20 years where there will be challenges posed not just for the airline industry, but for industry in general, around sustainable aviation fuels where it may have an upward impact on food prices.” ', ' ']"

Four years before that, it raised the subscription fee to $99 from $79.', 'Amazon’s annual increase amounts to about a 17% rise in price. Amazon also raised the monthly price of a Prime membership from $12.99 to $14.99, the company said. New members will see the increased prices on Feb. 18, and current members will be billed at the higher rate after March 25.', 'Amazon stock rose more than 14% at one point on Thursday in extended trading.', 'Launched in 2005, Amazon Prime gives members access to free two-day shipping, as well as access to exclusive movies and TV shows, among other perks. As of last April, the service had more than 200 million subscribers worldwide. ', 'The membership program remains one of the biggest growth levers for Amazon’s core retail business. Prime members spend considerably more on Amazon than non-Prime customers, and they also shop more often.', 'Amazon is raising the price of Prime as it navigates the dual challenges of continued supply chain disruptions and labor constraints. The company raised wages and offered generous signing bonuses to attract workers in a tight labor market. To avoid delivery disruptions, it rerouted packages over longer and costlier distances to get them to facilities with enough staff to handle them.', 'The cost of keeping Prime members hooked on the service has also become more expensive for Amazon. The company spends billions of dollars annually to add more compelling video and music content to its streaming service. And, in recent years, Amazon has poured money into building out its logistics and fulfillment network to make one-day shipping the default nationwide.']"

The news sent Crocs shares soaring; the stock was recently up about 7%.', 'Chief Executive Andrew Rees explained on an earnings call a key advantage is the fact that the retailer’s clog shoes are easy to make and so the company faces fewer hurdles in shifting production around when needed.', '“Our shoes are really simple, and so [swapping] factories can be very, very quick,” Rees explained. “The classic clog has three components, two of which are made on site, so you don’t have a lot of external logistics to be able to get started. We think we’re competent in terms of rapid manufacturing.”', 'Crocs was quick to begin diversifying its manufacturing overseas, especially with facilities in Vietnam facing prolonged shutdowns due to pandemic lockdowns in the region. In the short term, the company said it has moved some production back to China and Bosnia. It’s also ramping up production in Indonesia, and it has a facility in India expected to be online by next year.', 'Vietnam has traditionally represented a significant chunk of Crocs’ manufacturing base. It was expected to account for about 70% of production by the end of this year, the company said, but will be less due to Crocs’ diversification efforts.', 'As of this week, most of the retailer’s factories in Vietnam are operational again, according to Rees.

The retailer has already slightly increased the prices of some of its clog shoes. Pulling back on promotions has also helped to balance out inflationary pressures.', '“We’re proactively looking at other measures and things that we can do to kind of offset any inflationary pressures,” Chief Financial Officer Anne Mehlman told analysts.', 'Crocs shares have soared more than 140% year to date.

The coronavirus outbreak was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, and has since spread to the rest of the world, ravaging demand as well as the global economy.', 'He attributed the expected rebound to three main factors:', '“What we’ve seen in the last two or three months, those items around the home — whether it’s home improvements or enhancements to people’s home offices, electronics or even exercise bicycles — we’re seeing that sector has really picked up, and a lot of that production actually moves in containers as opposed to air freight,” Nixon explained.', 'ONE’s liner network services more than 100 countries, operating in a sector that moves over 90% of global goods, which gives the company a unique window into global economic activity.', 'Though there appears to be a rising tide lifting most boats, the group’s CEO says some pockets of weakness remain. “A lot of the automotive production, whether in Europe, America, Asia — particularly in Japan — is still quite weak,” Nixon explained.', 'On a regional basis, the recovery has become more widespread as lockdown measures ease. “Maybe some of the demand around intra-Asia is still recovering but we can see Europe is strong, North America is strong and even Latin America has picked up as well.”', 'Nixon cautions, however, that relative to the V-shaped recovery that the industry witnessed in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the current rebound looks more fragile.', '“Our exuberance is curtailed at the moment because we don’t really know how 2021-22 is going to play out. How much of this is a temporary build up in demand?” He also pointed to the risk that in Winter “some pickup in the pandemic situation means curtailment of certain activities and production.”', 'Before Covid-19 threatened to devastate container shipping, the sector was already grappling with the U.S.-China trade war and the specter of additional tariffs.', 'Nixon played down fears, however, that a further deterioration in ties between the world’s two largest economies could dent the industry’s recovery in the months ahead.', '“We don’t really like the tension. We don’t like politics interfering with global trade and supply chains, but maybe it’s part of the backstory these days. It would seem, at the moment, it’s not impacting cargo flows too much,” he said. “At the end of the day, we’ll still move the same amount of product on the ocean, it’s just a question of from which origin and to which destination.”', 'Nixon is not convinced about longer-term projections that the pandemic could usher in an era of de-globalization as countries rethink overseas production and respond to nationalist pressure.

19,Los Angeles rocket startup ABL Space aims for first launch as early as March,2021-01-08T17:05:29+0000,"['EL SEGUNDO, California — Rocket building startup ABL Space, founded by veterans of SpaceX and Morgan Stanley, is in the final stretch of preparations for its inaugural launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base.', '“We’re tracking toward vehicle readiness in March,” ABL president and CFO Dan Piemont told CNBC on Monday during a tour of the company’s Los Angeles-area facilities.', '“We’re working on the last bits of scheduling with the [Vandenberg launch] range. We do think that could push us into Q2, so right now no earlier than March but no later than June is the plan,” Piemont added.', 'ABL’s first launch represents the latest company that is close to offering another option for satellites and spacecraft to get to orbit, in the increasingly competitive space sub-sector of private rocket builders. ABL would enter the market as an option in between Elon Musk’s SpaceX and small launcher Rocket Lab, and the timing of its inaugural attempt comes as several other companies race to reach orbit for the first time.', 'ABL has raised $49 million to date in venture capital funding, with investors including Venrock, New Science Ventures, Lynett Capital and Lockheed Martin Ventures. Additionally, ABL previously announced it has won contracts from the Air Force Research Laboratory and AFWERX, with the awards worth $44.5 million over three years.', '“We consider the program fully funded well beyond the first launch, and into launching our sixth, seventh and eighth missions and beyond,” Piemont said.', 'ABL CEO Harry O’Hanley said that in the past few months the company has focused on completing integrated tests of the upper stage of its RS1 rocket at Edwards Air Force Base, tests which included firing the in-house developed E2 engine. One of the key remaining milestones is a full duration test firing of the upper stage, which O’Hanley said is “the next big one on the roadmap” to launch.', 'ABL’s RS1 rocket stands at 88 feet tall, and is designed to launch as much as 1,350 kilograms (or nearly 1½ tons) of payload to low Earth orbit – at a price of $12 million per launch. That puts RS1 in the middle of the commercial launch market, between Rocket Lab’s small Electron for $7 million and SpaceX’s heavy Falcon 9 for $62 million.', 'It also pits ABL against several other companies developing “medium-lift” rockets that are aiming to reach orbit this year, such as Richard Branson’s Virgin Orbit, Relativity Space and Firefly Aerospace.', 'RS1 is made of an aluminum alloy and, when ABL first set out designing the rocket, Piemont said the company got quotes from suppliers on how much it would cost using traditional manufacturing processes for each part.', 'But then ABL set about vertically integrating as many parts of RS1′s manufacturing as possible, such as designing the E2 engines to be 3D-printed in three pieces, so as to fit in readily available metal printers.', '“With the verticalization we’ve done — as well as the process improvements we found in the primary structures, turbopumps, engines, avionics and elsewhere — we’re looking at about 25% of th', 'at quoted cost,” Piemont said, or “about a 75% cost savings based on that portfolio of improvements.”', 'O’Hanley and Piemont met as undergraduates at MIT, before the former went to work at SpaceX for nearly six years and the latter started his career with Morgan Stanley’s institutional finance group. But in mid-2017, O’Hanley began bouncing ideas off of Piemont about starting a new rocket company and the pair decided to found it together, officially incorporating ABL in August 2017.', '“The way we’ve built our company in every domain has always been bottoms up, we’ve never hired a VP,” O’Hanley said. “When we realized we needed to have machine shop, we hired a machinist and bought one machine.”', 'Piemont said ABL’s “second hire was actually a web developer,” because “all the software we use to run our processes is custom.” He and O’Hanley wanted even ABL’s manufacturing software to be built in-house, so that “before we even started designing the vehicle, we’re entering software systems of use for purchasing inventory, filing work orders and build orders, run test operations and collect data for review.”', '“We’ve been building that side of our infrastructure, along with the vehicle itself, which is I think been an underrated aspect of how we stay nimble and move fast,” Piemont added.', 'ABL now has about 105 employees, with about 90,000 square feet of space in several buildings in El Segundo, as well as testing facilities at Edwards Air Force Base and at Spaceport America in New Mexico.', '“We can build and ship a launch vehicle about every 30 days, based on infrastructure we have now,” Piemont said. “We’re tracking towards eight or nine [rockets] a year based on existing infrastructure.”', 'While ABL has significant contracts and relationships with the Pentagon, Piemont said the company’s customer pipeline is 60% private, or commercial, versus 40% government payloads. The company has customers lined up to launch payloads on its first few missions, although ABL may fly mass simulators, which are often a slab of concrete to represent a spacecraft’s weight, for the first RS1 launch.', 'Spending $100 million has been the benchmark for a 21st century rocket builder to reach orbit for the first time. SpaceX and Rocket Lab, the two private companies currently flying regularly, each spent roughly that much — and even Astra, which came just shy of reaching orbit with its first space launch last month, had raised about $100 million from investors.', 'But ABL thinks it will reach orbit in under four years since its founding, and for less.', '“Our total expenditures through the day we ran the integrated stage test in October was $25 million, which gives us the high confidence that we will complete the orbital program for well under $100 million,” Piemont said.', 'Beyond the rocket itself, ABL also touts the efficiency of its GS0 deployable ground system. It’s essentially the barebones of a launch facility — the erector, fueling, electrical, control center and more — all packed into a few standard-sized shipping containers.', '“The GS0 system give us some huge advantages, because infrastructurally all we need is a flat concrete pad and everything else we can build here at El Segundo and then deliver to the site,” Piemont said.', 'The system’s development is complete, with ABL now constructing GS0. In addition to flexibility and simplicity, ABL sees GS0 as enabling “responsive launching,” O’Hanley explained — a feature the U.S military is interested in utilizing.', '“We’ve actually got a contract with the Space Force to demonstrate some of those activities on the ground, where we’re basically working with them to bring a rocket vertical and see how quickly we can fill it and prepare for launch operations,” O’Hanley said.', '“Short call time is a huge sublime business for what we’re doing, and we have a set of concepts for the DOD where you can have RS1s stored on base, ready to launch for this rapid call up time. Part of having the lightweight launch infrastructure, the mobile launch site, is to enable that,” he added.', 'He noted that ABL will be conducting that demonstration for the Space Force later this year.', 'The practice, and not just the theory, of reusing rockets to save money and time has gained steady traction in the past few years, in large part due to SpaceX’s success landing its rocket boosters. Rocket Lab has also begun to attempt to recover its Electron rocket, despite originally designing the boosters to be expendable.', 'While RS1 is designed to be expendable, O’Hanley and Piemont stressed that ABL has not ruled out working to upgrade the rocket to be reusable in the future.', '“Economically, if we throw these away every time, that’s totally fine for our purposes and the books look great,” O’Hanley said. “If we did a reusable rocket, it would likely be motivated by logistics and cycle time, manufacturing, more so than cost.”', 'Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck has similarly cited production speed as a primary reason for reusing rockets, rather than the cost savings advantage that SpaceX leadership frequently points to as its motivation.', 'O’Hanley said ABL is not thinking about reuse ahead of its first launch, as “right now it’s minimize scope, get to the pad, be successful.”', '“I think as we scale up we will evaluate it after first launch,” O’Hanley said.', 'He added that ABL has the right team to add reusability to its rockets, as he led work on the “grid fin” system that SpaceX uses to control its Falcon 9 rockets during return through the atmosphere. Other employees having similar strong reusability pedigrees — such as members of the team that did the first refurbishment of a Falcon 9.', '“So reuse is not in the current near-term plans, but it’s something that we probably are set up for in the future,” O’Hanley said.', 'Subscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world.']"
20,Facebook’s Meta mission was laid out in a 2018 paper declaring ‘The Metaverse is ours to lose’,2021-10-30T12:16:18+0000,"['In June 2018, Oculus executive Jason Rubin sent an email to Facebook board member Marc Andreessen with the subject line “The Metaverse.”', '“We believe that the right way to break through consumer indifference to VR is to deliver what they expect and want from the medium: THE METAVERSE,” reads the first slide of a 50-page document outlining a strategy for building a virtual world.', 'The three-year-old document, obtained by CNBC, laid the foundation for the futuristic ambitions of Meta, the company that until now was called Facebook. CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s hour-long demo on Thursday, which culminated in the announcement of the new company name, was designed to portray a very different world than the one we currently inhabit at a time when Facebook faces a non-stop barrage of negative headlines tied to the addictive nature of its social media products.', 'Zuckerberg told viewers that the company sees the metaverse, which will take five to 10 years to go mainstream, as the next frontier in technology — the place where people will live, work and play. His presentation came just days after the company announced in its earnings report that the Reality Labs hardware division will become its own financial reporting segment as of the fourth quarter.', 'The paper sent to Andreessen in 2018 now looks like the first draft of history. It imagined users floating through a digital universe of virtual ads, filled with virtual goods that people buy. There would be virtual people that they marry, while spending as little time as possible in the so-called “meatverse” — referring to the real world because humans are flesh and blood.  Rubin used the phrase “shock and awe” 12 times to describe the desired experience.', 'Andreessen was a critical recipient, not just because he’s been on Facebook’s board since 2008, but also due to his influence in this specific space. Through his firm, Andreessen was an early backer of Oculus and also put money into Roblox, the gaming platform for kids that’s focused on building its own metaverse.', 'The document was also sent to Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, the head of Facebook’s hardware division, who was promoted in July to chief technology officer (starting next year) and to Hugo Barra, the company’s vice president of virtual reality. The person who shared the document with CNBC wasn’t authorized to speak about it, but Rubin confirmed its validity in an interview on Friday.', '“The Metaverse is ours to lose,” reads one of the first section heads in Rubin’s paper. He went on to say that Facebook started thinking about the concept of the metaverse as a way to appeal to general consumers, because VR wasn’t broadly popular.', 'Facebook acquired Oculus for $2 billion in 2014, and as of June 2018, the company’s VR headsets had amassed 250,000 monthly active players, according to the document. But despite hundreds of millions of dollars invested in content for “early adopters and pioneers,” Rubin wrote that the devices hadn’t caught on with non-hardcore gamers and “the average consumer is waiting for the day that VR is ‘fully baked.’”', '“We believe that ‘fully baked’ means the metaverse,” Rubin wrote. “Only such a massive launch will be able to get the attention of VR doubter and VR-maybe-tomorrow crowd.”', 'Rubin, whose title at Meta is now vice president of metaverse content, told CNBC that his paper was read fairly widely, but it wasn’t the only one getting attention. ', '“A lot of people had visions of the metaverse at the time, and there were various documents that were floating around with various opinions,” Rubin said on Friday. “I wanted to get mine out there. That’s how we create things here at Facebook. There’s a lot of ideas, a lot of people and they kind of boil up. I’d like to think that some of it was useful.”', 'Rubin predicted in the paper that the project could potentially be built in four years and that Facebook could go it alone. But he now realizes that it will take more time and that Meta is going to have to partner with a wide array of companies rather than owning and controlling the whole system.', '“That’s another way in which we’ve evolved our thinking,” said Rubin, who was previously an executive in the video game industry. “We have to work with others, we have to build it in a lot of steps because it’s going to take a long time.”', 'When he wrote the document, Rubin indicated he wasn’t sure how much time Facebook would have. He just knew it was important to “go for the kill” and outrun the competition', '“The first metaverse that gains real traction is likely to the be the last,” Rubin wrote. “We must act first, and go big, or we risk being one of those wannabes.”', 'Facebook had the potential to effectively shut competitors like Google, Apple, Sony, HTC and Valve out of the VR market, he wrote, adding that Sony was focused on the PlayStation 5, HTC was unhappy with its potential hardware partners and Facebook was investing more than Valve, the maker of Steam.', '“Google and Apple don’t really exist in VR in any real way yet,” the document said. “Daydream is a joke,” Rubin wrote, referencing a VR platform that Google ended up discontinuing a year later.', 'He also wasn’t keen to partnering at the time. There was no point in working closely with other potential rivals, because Facebook should be where all users go for their virtual experiences, the document says.', '“Let’s not build the Metaverse with the plan to help other Platforms accumulate and retain consumers,” Rubin wrote. “Let’s build the Metaverse to keep them from being in the VR business in a meaningful way at all.”', 'Rubin emphasized on Friday that the company has moved away from that approach and that the plan is for the metaverse be interoperable and open, not “restrictive to one company.”', 'A Meta spokesperson said in an emailed statement that technology has evolved since 2018, when the focus was mainly VR. The company said it has always expected competition in the market from Microsoft, Google, Apple, Sony, Roblox and many others.', '“What has always been clear: investing in and building products that consumers want is the key to success; that we cannot build the metaverse alone; and that collaboration with developers, creators, and experts will be critical,” the spokesperson said.', 'In one section, Rubin outlines a scenario featuring a fictional user named Priya, who visits the metaverse. Priya enters a virtual city equipped with a bowling alley, stores, theaters and a Facebook pavilion described as “the largest building, almost church like in its dominance of the square.” ', 'Priya can interact with others and use the metaverse currency to pay for her avatar’s new hair style. Priya eventually meets another user who looks like a green and warty ogre. They end up getting married.', '“The only thing she spends as much time doing as she spends in the Metaverse is working, eating, socializing, and sleeping in the IRL ‘MEATverse,’” Rubin wrote. “Her entertainment time is spent more and more virtually. This is aided by Netflix, Facebook, Instagram and other Metaverse integrations.”', 'A decade into this hypothetical scenario, Rubin says the company’s metaverse would reach 100 million hardware units sold, with 50% being Oculus branded or licensed and the rest coming from other hardware makers.', 'Within two decades, time spent in the metaverse could rival that of “TV in the 90′s and Facebook in recent years.” And most importantly for Facebook, “net revenue after developer payout is billions a year,” he wrote. That would come from the sale of virtual real estate, hats, weapons and status symbols.', 'Revenue would also come from ads, the market Facebook knows best. Rubin imagines Coca-Cola paying for prime placement of a pavilion, Ford paying for its virtual cars to be usable or Procter & Gamble promoting its brands on digital billboards. Gucci could open a virtual store and Comcast (owner of CNBC parent NBCUniversal) would pay for “a giant sign that says, ‘Comcast: Get Better MetaSpeed!’”', '“If the Metaverse is where people are spending time, then it is where the real economy will want to be,” Rubin wrote. “It is our goal to bring the Metaverse to this stage. Anything short doesn’t seem like it is a Facebook product.”', 'Given that deep level of immersion, Rubin estimated that 100 million metaverse users could lead to more revenue than a real universe with one billion users.', '“I might check in to Facebook multiple times a day, but I will LIVE in the Metaverse, work in the Metaverse, and potentially prefer my time in the Metaverse to my day-to-day grind,” the document says.', 'To be successful, Rubin writes, the metaverse has to be scary. That is, it has to to be so ambitious, so bold, so filled with thousands of hours of gameplay, so life-altering that Facebook engineers are terrified of what they’re up against.', '“If delivering the Metaverse we set out to build doesn’t scare the living hell out of us, then it is not the Metaverse we should be building, it is not what customers want, and it is, therefore, meaningless,” he wrote. “Anything else is a Mini-verse.”', 'Building all of that and reaching the universe of customers necessary, Rubin wrote, would require more than just internal resources. He suggested that Facebook would need a gaming studio with a team of more than 100 people that could create a massive multiplayer online game.', '“One thing is absolutely clear: There is no team inside Facebook with the cohesion and experience of shipping large, technically challenging, awe-inspiring game/interactive product that is capable of producing the City,” Rubin wrote, referring to the digital world the company was aiming to build. “For these reasons, we are going to need to make an acquisition.”', 'He named as potential targets Insomniac Games and Gearbox Software. Other studios like Blizzard and Rockstar were too big and too profitable for an acquisition and too committed to their own universe.', 'Rubin ended up recommending Ready at Dawn, the studio behind “Lone Echo.” Facebook did the deal in June 2020.', 'In addition to the metaverse’s technological achievements, the launch of the product would be critical and would need to “create shock and awe,” Rubin wrote.', 'Zuckerberg should avoid going up on stage at a conference with a slide behind him that reads, “Welcome to the Metaverse” if the company isn’t ready to meet the moment.', '“If we telegraph every step of our roadmap because we have keynote minutes to fill, the competition will always be one step behind,” Rubin wrote. “Let’s not do that. Let’s wait until we have a Metaverse worthy of the name — a Fait Accompli.”', 'Zuckerberg didn’t fully heed that call. His presentation on Thursday was bold, but the world he depicted is nowhere near ready for consumer navigation.', 'The demo was a Pixar-like animation, showcasing software the company hopes to build. It was filled with users hanging out and working out as avatars or cartoonish versions of themselves. Zuckerberg acknowledged that the technology is a long way off, potentially as far as a decade into the future.', 'Some suggested that Facebook needed to change the conversation and distract the public after six damaging weeks of stories based on leaked documents from a whistleblower.', 'Rubin had a different explanation. He said the company now knows that to achieve its herculean mission, it needs to bring others along for the ride, kissing goodbye to the walled garden approach.', '“This is a long journey that we’re going to be on with a lot of different companies,” Rubin said in the interview. “And you just can’t keep it under wraps that long.” ', '— CNBC’s Samantha Subin contributed to this report.', 'WATCH: Facebook name change more for investors and employees']"

The company’s 39-year-old founder reciprocates the appreciation and offers a handshake before heading into a meeting with suppliers.', 'The acknowledgement was one of many from employees that included fist-bumps, waves and other cordialities during a recent half-day visit to the plant with media and Scaringe, whose daily office is inside the former Mitsubishi Motors facility.', 'They’re pleasantries, but also signs of confidence in the CEO in the face of daunting challenges for the electric vehicle maker.', 'Wall Street has likewise applauded Scaringe, who founded the company in 2009 and brought it public through a blockbuster IPO in November. Most notably, Morgan Stanley lead auto analyst Adam Jonas dubbed Rivian as “the one” to be able to compete against EV industry leader Tesla.', 'But Rivian, like the rest of the automotive industry, is facing massive supply disruptions and has internally experienced expected, but still problematic, production snags that caused it to miss its production expectations last year.', 'The company’s stock price is off by more than 60% this year, as investors look for safer ground than an EV start-up amid recession fears.', 'Scaringe is aware of such problems but, like he has for more than a decade, remains focused on the mission at hand: to prove the company’s worth by actually producing vehicles, an ironic differentiator for the industry that separates Rivian from an influx of new EV start-ups in recent years.

That estimate is down from initial expectations of about 50,000 vehicles, slashed by supplier disruptions.', 'Scarcity in semiconductor chips, a shortage the auto industry has been battling for more than a year now, and wire harnesses, which act as the nerves of a vehicle, poses the biggest hurdles for the company. Both are critical components in vehicles.', '“The vast majority of our vehicle is not having supply chain constraints. It’s just a small percentage,” Scaringe said. “It doesn’t take more than one part to stop the production.”', 'Scaringe doesn’t expect semiconductor supplies to normalize until next year. He, along with every other executive in the automotive industry, is regularly in contact with suppliers attempting to source, produce and ship as many parts as possible.', 'For Rivian, that includes having some of its employees on-site at the facilities of their suppliers in an attempt to assist production.', '“We don’t have a demand challenge at all. We have a ‘can we create enough vehicles’ challenge?” he told CNBC after a tour of the vehicle plant. “We have a supply chain problem. It’s frustrating, but we’re going to get through that.”', 'Rivian declined to disclose how many Amazon delivery vans the company has built, but dozens were waiting outside of the facility, ready to be delivered, and plenty more were being assembled inside.', 'The electric vans are expected to be a crucial part of Rivian’s growth. The first vans go to Amazon, Rivian’s largest shareholder with a 20% stake, followed eventually by deliveries to other companies.', 'Rivian says the vans can be produced faster than the consumer R1T and R1S vehicles because they have fewer features. They also go through fewer processes at the plant. For example, the painting of the vans – a tedious and long process – takes two hours less than paint jobs for the other vehicles.', 'Victor Taylor, senior director of stamping, body and plastic for the company, also noted there’s less complexity and time needed for the vans in the body shop.', 'Rivian, to the dismay of reservation holders, increased prices for its vehicles last month due to higher commodity costs. The company quickly rolled back the increases for its 70,000-some existing reservation holders but said it would hold to the updated pricing for new reservations made as of March 1.', 'The increases make the starting prices of the vehicles $67,500 for the R1T and $72,500 for the R1S. At those prices, both are considered luxury vehicles rather than mainstream models.', 'Scaringe said the company plans to produce lower-priced vehicles on its next-generation EV platform. Those vehicles will be manufactured at a planned $5 billion plant in Georgia, which is expected to come online in 2024.', 'Much like other automakers, Rivian also plans to maximize profits and increase performance of current models, according to Scaringe.', 'It’s the beginning of the end of fossil fuel-powered consumer vehicles — as far as Scaringe is concerned. The 39-year-old believes production and sales of such vehicles will come to an end in his lifetime, sooner rather than later.', 'Without putting an exact date on it, Scaringe said the end of that era is likely closer to 20 years from now rather than 50 years, with companies forced to move way from fossil fuels out of necessity as well as potential pressures from Wall Street and regulators.', '“Most countries around the world will stop selling gas engine-powered cars. The scale of the shift is hard to fully appreciate,” he said. “The challenge is whether it’s driven by policy or not. The businesses that are going to survive are the ones that recognize that the end state for combustion is zero.”', 'Rivian is among a flurry of EV start-ups to have gone public in recent years, but the company’s competitors have done so through deals with special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. Rivian held a traditional and more direct initial public offering.', 'Many companies that went the SPAC route have faced financial problems or received inquiries from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission into their deals to go public or other business matters.', 'Scaringe believes some of those companies won’t be competitors Rivian needs to worry about for much longer.', '“As the financial markets shifted from a growth orientation to more sort of a value orientation, I think a lot of those really underfinanced SPACs and companies like that are going to slowly start disappearing,” he said. “They’re going to run out of capital.”', 'Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently said the car company would make a “dedicated robotaxi.” He didn’t offer a timeframe or any additional details beyond saying it would “look futuristic” and be fully self-driving, something the company has not achieved despite the name of its “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) driver-assist feature.', 'Rivian has not announced plans for similar vehicle, and Scaringe wouldn’t comment on a counterpart directly. But he said the company will “offer lots of different products in the future.”', 'Scaringe, who moved from Southern California to near the 3.3 million-square-foot plant, is known as a driven, level-headed planner who typically lets his actions speak louder than his words (or tweets). It’s a different style from Musk, though both are considered extremely detail-oriented and ambitious leaders.', 'Rivian became the first automaker to begin mass production of an all-electric pickup truck last year, beating to market Tesla and longtime segment leaders General Motors and Ford Motor, which holds a roughly 12% stake in Rivian.', 'GM started shipping its GMC Hummer EV pickup in December, months after Rivian launched the R1T. Ford is expected to soon begin shipping an electric version of its F-150 pickup, called the F-150 Lightning, followed by Tesla’s long-delayed Cybertruck, which is planned to go into production next year.', 'While there have been many comparisons of the Rivian R1T to the other electric pickups, Scaringe isn’t bothered by the competition. He actually welcomes it, for now. He believes there’s currently more than enough demand to fulfill EV pickup production in the near term.', '“Humans have an infatuation with winners and losers, like everything in life has to be a zero-sum game,” he said. “I really just don’t see it that way. ... I look at it as I hope Hummer’s wildly successful. I truly do. I hope Lightning’s wildly successful, and I hope we’re wildly successful. And I think all three of those can happen from an intellectual honesty point of view.”']"

25,Telesat to build a $5 billion global satellite network to bring fiber-like internet to businesses,2021-02-09T13:30:05+0000,"['Canadian telecommunications satellite operator Telesat announced on Tuesday that French-Italian space hardware manufacturer Thales Alenia Space will build its next-generation broadband satellite network called Lightspeed.', 'Lightspeed will focus on providing high-speed fiber-like internet to Telesat’s customers around the globe. The network, known in the industry as a constellation, will consist of 298 next-generation satellites that orbit the Earth at an altitude of about 1000 kilometers, or a little over twice the altitude of the International Space Station.', '“We’re not a start-up. This isn’t a new business activity for us. It’s the same old customers and same old markets, but with an architecture that is better and more disruptive,” Telesat CEO Dan Goldberg told CNBC. ', 'The company largely focuses on business-to-business customers and expects its Lightspeed constellation will cost $5 billion build, including the cost of the satellites, buying rocket launches, building ground infrastructure and developing software platforms to operate the network. The cost of the satellites make up the bulk of that total, as Goldberg said the contract with Thales Alenia Space is worth about $3 billion.', 'Notably, Goldberg clarified that Telesat’s Lightspeed constellation is not designed to compete with the direct-to-consumer networks of SpaceX’s Starlink or Amazon’s Kuiper.', '“This is not a consumer broadband play,” Goldberg said. “We’re one of the largest satellite operators in the world today and we’ve been doing this for 50 years now. But we’ve always been an enterprise kind of service provider ... we know that customer base, we know those markets. We collaborated with those customers when we conceived of this opportunity and designed this constellation.”', 'Goldberg explained that Telesat’s Lightspeed customers include cruise ships, airlines, and rural municipalities. The network’s anchor customer will be the Canadian government, Goldberg noted, which signed on to use Lightspeed to “set up a pool of capacity that will get sold at very attractive rates to municipalities and and really rural broadband providers.”', '“It’s orders of magnitude better than what exists today and even what a lot of folks are planning,” Goldberg said. “This is all about delivering a low cost per bit to the market.”', 'Telesat plans to begin launching the first Lightspeed in 2023, with initial satellites launched by Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin on its New Glenn rocket. Goldberg said he’s been tracking New Glenn’s development “closely,” as the rocket’s inaugural launch is planned in the next year, but he’s confident that “it will be ready” when Telesat begins launching in two years. Telesat will also “be announcing other launch providers in the coming months.”', 'One of the key technologies that Goldberg said the Lightspeed satellites will leverage is intersatellite links — which allow satellites to create data connections to each other, rather than individually connecting to points on the ground.', '“We’re basically deploying a big space-based mesh IP network, which means all of our satellites are always online and being able to be revenue-generating and connected to a user,” Goldberg said.', 'Intersatellite links are key to reducing the number of points on the ground that the satellite constellation needs to connect to, as well as increase the overall speed of the global network. Goldberg said that Telesat plans to deploy about 30 ground stations around the world, “because we don’t need that many” and it helps “minimize capital investment and spending on the ground.”', 'Telesat has also been working to decrease the reflectivity of its Lightspeed satellites, after SpaceX’s Starlink was hit by a public outcry by astronomers that it’s hundreds of satellites appeared  as bright streaks across images taken by telescopes. Goldberg noted that the Lightspeed satellites will be at about twice the altitude the Starlink satellites, while also having a fraction as many in the total constellation. Telesat’s Lightspeed satellites are also designed to last about 10 to 12 years each, so the company doesn’t have to replace them too frequently.', '“We’ve been using space for 50 years — we’re a responsible industrial user of space.

CEO Mike Petters said the company is looking for workers in craft and design positions as the market for shipbuilding is improving. With suppliers in all 50 states and 37,000 employees around the globe, the company builds nuclear-powered aircraft and submarines at its Newport News, Virginia, shipyard, and non-nuclear ships such as cutters and destroyers in Pascagoula, Mississippi.', '“We have dozens of crafts that are involved in the building of the ships — it’s pipefitters, welders, painters, insulators, sheet metal workers,” Petters said. “Just about anything you can imagine you might need in building a city, we use, because, frankly, that is what we are building.”', 'Now Trump is also calling for a major expansion of the U.S. military, to the tune of $603 billion, with a $54 billion budgetary boost in defense spending. Among the president’s priorities is to expand the Navy: He’s calling for 350 ships, up from today’s 274, marking the largest naval buildup since the Cold War.', 'That move would mean more business and jobs after years of stagnation due to constraints under the government’s sequestration of funds. The president has made repeated calls for Congress to eliminate the Defense sequester, which places spending caps until 2021. “By eliminating the sequester and the uncertainty it creates, it will make it easier for the Navy to plan for the future, and thus control costs and get the best deals for the taxpayer, which of course is very important,” Trump said last week at Huntington Ingalls’ Newport News shipyard. Still, a divided Congress stands in Trump’s way. “There are political dynamics in Washington that aren’t going to let him achieve a larger military without consequences,” said Roman Schweizer, senior aerospace defense and policy analyst at Cowen. “I think it’s going to be difficult for him to get what he wants.” ', 'The company is also investing in training apprentices like Jeffery Cofer, a 26-year-old Iraq War veteran. Cofer served in the National Guard in 2011 and now serves his country by building ships for the Navy. His prior service experience gives him a unique perspective on constructing equipment to be used by U.S. servicemen and women. “While I was in Iraq, one of my greatest fears was that we would have some kind of a mechanical or system failure due to a lack of quality,” Cofer recalled. “I didn’t want something that was avoidable to cause me injury or kill me. I don’t want our sailors to have that fear — I want them to know that the work I do here and we do here is quality work, and we deliver good ships.”', 'Cofer has spent the past three years working toward completing his 8,000 hours to be a pipefitter, studying everything from basic math to naval architecture. Entry-level salaries range from $36,000 to $57,000 a year, with opportunities for overtime and benefits. The ships built by Huntington Ingalls last for up to 50 years, Petters said. “What we have is the opportunity for you to do something with your hands, and your head, and your heart that will be bigger than yourself,” he said. “You get to be part of a big team that is going to be playing a very important role in American history for the rest of your life.”', 'While Trump has yet to release a formal budget, Petters remains optimistic that the new administration will be good for business. He is also hopeful the sequester will be lifted, as his company relies heavily on the orderly flow of work from one ship to the next. “Let’s get out of this kind of crazy method of government-by-algorithm,” he said. “And let’s get back to the process of creating budgets and establishing priorities and allocating resources to those priorities.” Congressional fight or not, workers like Cofer will be ready for action. “I know what it feels like to be on the other end of equipment built by American workers, so I’m very honored and proud to be a part of it,” he said.']"

That compares with the 254 ships it estimates would be bought under the Navy’s prior force goal.', '“Cost is probably the biggest challenge reaching the larger fleet size,” said Smithberger. “You’d have to increase Pentagon spending a lot to afford everything that they’re trying to buy. It will require cutting other services or other Navy priorities, including airplanes.”', 'Yet the time it will take to reach a 355-ship Navy also is a concern, given signs the Chinese are aggressively ramping up their own naval forces. Separately, Russia is undergoing a modernization plans of its own, including adding advanced nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines to its fleet.', '“The Chinese are coming hard, meaning they are going for mass numbers and new advanced technology,” said Hendrix, of the Center for a New American Security.', '“The Russians have made decisions to invest in fairly exquisite platforms, like the new Yasen-Class submarine, a nuclear powered, fast-attack boat which is very advanced,” he added. “And if they got two or three of those loose in the Atlantic, and we didn’t know where they were, it would cause real complications for the United States as well as NATO.”', 'In April, the nonpartisan CBO estimated the earliest the Navy could reach the 355-ship goal was by 2035, though it cautioned that 15-year buildup forecast was based on the service getting “sufficient funding.” The CBO also estimates the cost to build, crew and operate the larger fleet would average $102 billion annually through 2047. ', 'Regardless, Hendrix suggests there is perhaps a faster way to reach the 355-ship fleet size but not necessarily by adding newly constructed ships. Instead, he suggests the Navy might want to consider taking ships out of mothballs and keeping others in service longer to maintain the 355-ship fleet.', 'Others are not so sure it makes sense to keep ships in the fleet longer than they are scheduled. ', '“You can’t just run the same ships well beyond their service lives to assume that you can keep up the same level of capability to deter our adversaries,” said Slattery.', 'Hendrix said another option to increase the size of the Navy fleet is to look at some vessels in the so-called Ready Reserve Force ships, which are maintained for national defense and emergencies.', 'Either way, he believes there’s an urgent need to reach that 355-ship target sooner rather than later. The retired Navy captain insisted the Navy should strive to reach the 355-ship fleet “within a decade in order to deter both the Chinese and Russians who are looking to challenge us at sea.”']"

While it was already trending in that direction, new data from Cambridge University released early Wednesday makes it official.', 'As of July, 35.4% of bitcoin’s hashrate – an industry term used to describe the collective computing power of miners – is in the United States, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. That’s a 428% increase from September 2020.', 'America partly has China to thank for its newfound dominance in the mining industry.', 'Twelve months ago, China was the market leader in terms of hashrate – by a long shot. But Beijing’s crypto crackdown in the spring took half the world’s bitcoin miners offline practically overnight.', 'Miners started fleeing China en masse, heading to the cheapest energy sources on the planet in what was dubbed “the great mining migration.” A whole lot of them ended up in America.', 'The newly-released Cambridge data zeroes out China’s average monthly share of the global hashrate in July – a major reversal from September 2020, when China captured about 67% of the market.', '“The whole narrative of China controls bitcoin is now completely destroyed,” said Boaz Sobrado, a London-based fintech data analyst.', 'The U.S. ticks a lot of boxes for migrant bitcoin miners searching for a new home.', 'For one, states like Texas boast some of the world’s lowest energy prices, which is a major incentive to miners who compete in a low-margin industry, where their only variable cost is typically energy.', 'The U.S. is also flush with renewable power sources.', 'Washington state is a mecca for hydropowered mining farms. New York produces more hydroelectric power than any other state east of the Rocky Mountains, and it counts its nuclear power plants toward its 100% carbon-free electricity goal. Meanwhile, Texas’ share of renewables is growing over time, with 20% of its power coming from wind as of 2019. The Texas grid also continues to rapidly add more wind and solar power.', 'Miners across the country have also harnessed nuclear power. Some are latching their rigs to otherwise stranded energy, like natural gas going to waste in oil fields across Texas. This reduces greenhouse gas emissions and generates money for the gas providers and miners.', 'This shift toward zero-emission, clean energy sources has already begun to recast the narrative among skeptics that bitcoin is bad for the environment. ', '“Mining is price sensitive, so as to seek out the lowest-cost power and the lowest-cost power tends to be renewable because if you’re burning fossil fuels ... it has extraction, refinement and transport costs,” Blockstream CEO Adam Back said. ', 'Besides lower electricity costs, some U.S. states like Texas also have crypto-friendly policymakers and an adequate supply of hosting infrastructure.', 'The state has a deregulated power grid with real-time spot pricing that lets customers choose between power providers, and crucially, its political leaders are pro-crypto. Those are dream conditions for miners who want a kind welcome and cheap energy sources.', '“If you’re looking to relocate hundreds of millions of dollars of miners out of China, you want to make sure you have geographic, political, and jurisdictional stability. You also want to make sure there are private property rights protections for the assets that you are relocating,” said Darin Feinstein, co-founder of Core Scientific. ', 'America’s rise to the top is also a case of luck meeting preparation. The U.S. has been quietly boosting its hosting capacity for years.', 'Before bitcoin miners started coming to America, companies across the country made a gamble that eventually, if adequate infrastructure were in place, they would set up shop in the U.S. ', 'That gamble is paying off.', 'When bitcoin crashed in late 2017 and the wider market entered a multi-year crypto winter, there wasn’t much demand for big bitcoin farms. U.S. mining operators saw their opening and jumped at the chance to deploy cheap money to build up the mining ecosystem in the States. ', '“The large, publicly-traded miners were able to raise capital to go make big purchases,” said Mike Colyer, CEO of digital currency company Foundry, which helped bring over $300 million of mining equipment into North America.', 'Feinstein says that in the last 18 months, there has been a serious growth of mining infrastructure in America. “We’ve noticed a massive uptick in mining operations looking to relocate to North America, mostly in the U.S.,” continued Feinstein.', 'Companies like North American crypto mining operator Core Scientific kept building out hosting space all through the crypto winter to ensure the capacity to plug in new gear, according to Colyer. ', '“A majority of the new equipment manufactured from May 2020 through December 2020 was shipped to the U.S. and Canada,” he said.', 'Alex Brammer of Luxor Mining, a cryptocurrency pool built for advanced miners, points out that maturing capital markets and financial instruments around the mining industry also played a big role in the industry’s quick ascent in the U.S. Brammer says many of these American operators were able to start rapidly expanding once they secured financing by leveraging a multi-year track record of profitability and existing capital as collateral.', 'Covid also played a role.', 'Though the global pandemic shut down large swaths of the economy, the ensuing stimulus payments proved a boon for U.S. mining companies.', '“All the money printing during the pandemic meant that more capital needed to be deployed,” explained bitcoin mining engineer Brandon Arvanaghi. ', '“People were looking for places to park their cash. The appetite for large-scale investments had never been bigger. A lot of that likely found its way into bitcoin mining operations in places outside of China,” continued Arvanaghi.', 'Not all miners, however, are headed to renewable destinations.', 'Kazakhstan is just behind the U.S. in terms of its share of the global bitcoin mining market, with 18.1% of all crypto mining. It’s home to coal mines that provide a cheap and abundant supply of energy — but also ample carbon dioxide emissions.', 'However, several mining experts tell CNBC they think that Kazakhstan, which neighbors China, is just a temporary stopover on a longer migration west.', 'Brammer sees large miners going there in the short-term with older-generation equipment. “But as older-generation machines reach the end of their service lives, those companies will likely deploy new machines into more stable and energy efficient and renewable jurisdictions,” he said.', 'Also likely to put a damper on Kazakhstan’s popularity is a law newly signed by the president that will introduce extra taxes for crypto miners starting in 2022.', '“This will significantly change the incentives for people to deploy capital in Kazakhstan,” said Brammer.']"

Meanwhile, UPS is exploring new technologies, such as drones and self-driving trucks, to modernize its delivery services.', 'The moves come as Amazon is building up its delivery fleet, renting planes and offering $10,000 to its employees to leave the company and start their own local delivery business.', '“I think they have stated that they are now a competitor to the transport industry,” said Ken Hoexter, a research analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “And FedEx has clearly viewed them now in their recent moves as an increasing competitor.”', 'Just as some retail companies are uneasy about working with Amazon, which can be both a partner and a competitor, transportation companies are facing a similar dilemma. And with their customers facing off against Amazon in other industries, shipping companies may need to take sides.', 'Dan Neiweem, co-founder and principal of digital services and solutions provider Avionos, said that by ditching Amazon, FedEx may make itself more attractive to Amazon’s competitors in the retail space.', 'He compared it to reports that WalMart is pressuring some of its partners to use Microsoft’s Azure for cloud computing instead of Amazon Web Services. WalMart said “there are a small number of cases involving our most sensitive sales data that we’d prefer not sit on a competitor’s platform” but its vendors can choose the cloud service they prefer.', '“I think that what you’ll see is that a lot of the shipments that Amazon was going into the USPS and FedEx with are now going to be transitioned from other retailers who are saying ‘hey I don’t anybody in my space who works with Amazon,’” Neiweem said. “And you see that parallel very, very tightly with AWS and Azure.”', 'FedEx never relied on Amazon for a huge portion of its business. In a June statement announcing that Amazon would no longer be served by FedEx Express, the shipping company said Amazon accounted for 1.3% of its total revenues in 2018, or roughly $900 million.', 'From that perspective, FedEx’s decision to cut ties with Amazon makes sense, Hoexter said.', '“When you go to their sort centers, you can see that Walmart and Jet are a major customer of FedEx’s, so certainly that relationship is as important if not more important than Amazon,” Hoexter said.', '“So if you have to choose one, if UPS is larger with Amazon and you’re larger with Walmart, you’re going to kind of work closer with that candidate.”', 'Throughout its rise, Amazon has relied on UPS for a large portion of its shipping needs. UPS is still more exposed to Amazon than FedEx was. David Ross, transportation research analyst at Stifel, said he estimates that UPS gets between 7% and 9% of its total revenue from Amazon.', '“If you go back 10, 15 years UPS was the chosen parcel carrier by Amazon, and when they started their prime two-day offering it was a lot of UPS,” Ross said.', 'Amazon started using the U.S. Postal Service more after the delivery companies struggled to deliver packages on time during the 2013 holiday season, Ross said.', 'Online shopping has continued to grow since then. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce has grown from roughly 4% of total retails sales in 2010 to more than 10% earlier this year. FedEx said it expects e-commerce to grow to 100 million packages per day in the U.S. by 2026.', 'As e-commerce has boomed, Amazon has struck out more on its own and built a sizable delivery network. The tech giant may not be delivering many third-party packages right now, but Neiweem said that’s “sort of the last stand or threshold that they haven’t crossed yet.”', 'UPS and FedEx are also investing in their businesses, with both companies expanding delivery to 7 days per week.', 'FedEx, which said it has “a strong relationship with retailers of all sizes,” has started offering retailers extended hours for package pickup, partners with stores such as Dollar General to create customer pick up areas and is experimenting with a delivery robot.', 'UPS, which saw demand for next day air shipping increase 30% in the second quarter, has invested in TuSimple, an autonomous shipping business, and is forming a drone subsidiary called UPS Flight Forward. The company is also expanding its air fleet and is scheduled to add 11 cargo planes this year.', 'The growing demand for fast shipping has weighed on the financial results for large shipping companies. More home deliveries means shipping companies make less per stop than if they delivered a lot of packages to one spot, like a convenience store.', 'Hoexter said that domestic margins at UPS have been under pressure for the past several years, and that is where analysts will look to see if its new investments and increased leverage with Amazon are working.', '“As we get into peak season, have they found a way to stabilize those margins despite the growth of e-commerce? That’s going to be the key for the stock. When you ask what do we look for its the margin side and pricing if we start to see that improving or stabilizing. That’s the first step,” Hoexter said.', 'With FedEx now out of the picture, UPS may also be able to gain some short-term leverage on pricing, Hoexter said. That opportunity may not last for long, as Amazon continues to expand its own delivery network and expects to have 70 planes in its fleet by 2021.', 'For FedEx, the separation means the company can show that its e-commerce success is not tied to Amazon.', '“FedEx is just showing people that they don’t need Amazon to be a good business, and they feel that they can continue to grow without Amazon. I think they wanted to just distance themselves from Amazon in a way that made their own growth story a little more clear to people,” Ross said.']"

The first Fire TV Cube launched last July. Like its predecessor, the new model lets you control your TV, cable box and other inputs using just your voice. That means you can walk into the room and say “Alexa, tune to ESPN on cable” and the Fire TV Cube will pull up ESPN on cable TV. It also works with streaming services like Hulu, Netflix, Sling TV and more.', 'The new Fire TV Cube’s performance boost is thanks to a new processor, which should help cut down on lag when moving between apps. It also now locally processes basic Alexa requests for things like increasing the volume or returning to the home screen, instead of sending those requests to the cloud first. That should make those responses up to four times faster, Amazon says. The design is the same as last year’s model.', '“The design is the same because it’s worked well in terms of microphone array and layout,” Amazon’s vice president of product development for Fire TV Sandeep Gupta told CNBC, referring to the box’s ability to listen to voice commands. “Local voice control has a subset of commands that are critical and cut out the cloud part so if we recognize [a command] it can just execute it immediately,” he said.', 'Gupta told CNBC that Amazon has found Fire TV Cube owners are much more likely to interact using voice than other Fire TV product owners.', '“We get eight times the usage of voice than we do in other devices,” he said. “We see almost 80% of Fire TV Cube users using it for device automation and smart home devices,” he said.', 'The new Fire TV Cube costs $119.99 in the U.S., the same price as the original model. Pre-orders open on Wednesday in the U.S. and, for the first time, in Germany, the United Kingdom and Japan.

If you like using Messenger and you repeatedly hear its audible elements, “you’ll carry that with you in your life as a positive part of your experience,” said Littlejohn.', 'Sound designers come up with their beeps and bloops using musical instruments, synthesizers, software or even with the human voice. Google and Microsoft have silent anechoic chambers on their corporate campuses that sound designers can use.', 'Some also record audio out in the real world.', '“Almost every sound designer I know carries some type of miniature recorder no bigger than a phone, what are called field recorders,” Littlejohn said. “We record source all the time. These become things that we then can manifest in our products.”', 'At Google, building a prototype for a sound can take as little as two days, but conceiving of a sound that will reach billions of people might take months, O’Sullivan said. A sound designer might go through 100 cycles of listening to a sound in progress and making changes to it, including at different times of the day. If a sound is meant to break through the noise in a loud environment, then that’s part of the testing, too.', 'If Facebook is building a sound for smartphones, then sound designers will play back the sound on phones, rather than through comfortable headphones or powerful speakers, or even the tinny speakers on their laptops.', '“I won’t be listening to it specifically on speakers because that’s not the medium through which it will be experienced,” said Littlejohn.', 'When Bennett was at Microsoft, he rejected 800 to 1,000 candidates before shipping a sound in a product such as Windows 10. “I’m sure I listened to every shipping sound at least a couple thousand times before it was officially released,” he wrote in an email. “If I could still love it after all that, I knew it would probably age well in the real world.”', 'Once a sound has been released, Microsoft seeks out customer feedback, which can lead to changes, said Colin Day, a principal creative director at the company. Some people said they didn’t know they had received new direct messages in Teams, so in March 2020 the company updated that sound to make it more noticeable — but soon users said the sound was cutting through too much, Day said.', 'The coronavirus pandemic brought new attention to the sound of software.', 'During the online meetings we’ve been holding and the television interviews we’ve been watching, sounds from other people are spilling over into our ears. Sometimes, that’s by design.', 'Imagine that a start-up is trying to sell its software to a bank. People from both sides on a briefing call will hear the start-up CEO’s phone playing a melody every few minutes to signify that an email has come in. To the start-up’s salesperson on the call alongside the CEO, the sounds are nothing unusual. But the chief information officer from the bank might perceive that the start-up CEO has considerable inbound communication, and that could assure the person that the start-up’s wares are in demand.', '“It makes audible your network,” said Meredith Ward, director of film and media studies at Johns Hopkins University.', 'For Ward, reminders of events starting soon have become more important than ever. No longer is she seeing visual cues of what to do next because she’s no longer visiting different places on campus. Everything happens in front of a screen now, and sounds are the symbols of transition.', 'But the sounds can also blend together and become confusing. That can even apply to a single app, such as the communication app Discord. Users can participate in text and voice chats in a variety of groups, known as servers, and the “boop-beep” sound of a new message doesn’t tell them if it’s coming from a relative on one private server or a stranger in a server where thousands gather to discuss a game.', 'Sounds can also distract people, even for just a few seconds. As the pandemic continues, Day at Microsoft said he’s been thinking about the role that sound plays during meetings. “I want to be a really good active listener, and I want other people to practice that as well,” he said.', '“This happens to me personally quite a bit, where I’ll hear a sound and go, ‘What was that sound? I don’t even recognize that sound,’” said Greg Gordon, CEO of the San Francisco music-production institute Pyramind. “I have 20 to 30 tabs on my browser open, and I’m flipping between tabs. I know one of them gave me a notification, and I don’t remember which of them it was.”', 'Sounds that once seemed tolerable have become, for certain people, irritating.', 'To Bennett — Microsoft’s chief sound designer until earlier this year, when he struck out on his own — the sound that goes off when he received a text message on his iPhone began to grate on his ear, with what he said is a sharp attack and a long decay. He turned off the sound last year.', '“We’re probably hearing our messaging sounds, our IM sounds, a lot more,” he said. “I know there are days I’ve heard them all day long. You want to turn them off but if you step away, you’re missing something.”', 'Many product sounds now seem to go on too long for Bennett’s taste. A sound that plays for two and a half seconds, for example, might have worked well before the pandemic, when there were so many other sounds in the background. Now he wonders if it’s really necessary to hear the whole thing in order to grasp what it’s designed to convey.', 'Google has asked users about sounds and learned that some who kept their phones on silent when they worked at offices now have their sound on, so they don’t miss food deliveries or important messages from colleagues, O’Sullivan said. Some still prefer to keep audio notifications off, though. Jonathan Sterne, a professor of art history and communications studies at McGill University, said he likes listening to music while writing or grading and doesn’t want any other sounds coming out of his devices.', 'But sometimes the devices overrule his wishes. Earlier this year, he said, while teaching a class on Zoom, his Mac updated and its settings changed. The computer started making a sound with each text message that arrived. The sounds were loud, and he couldn’t immediately figure out how to disable them. “That was incredibly annoying,” he said.', 'Sound designers don’t want their work to be annoying. They need to make sure their sounds don’t reflect poorly on their employers.', '“There’s an aspect of sound design that is expressing the brand,” Google’s O’Sullivan said. People remember sounds and associate them with products.', 'Slack’s trademark sound is so distinctive, it’s become like a second logo. It was the work of Daniel Simmons, a Canadian musician who had previously played with Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield. Simmons made the music and sounds for Glitch, a video game that led to the creation of Slack, which launched in 2014.', 'Simmons described the origin of the sound, known as Knock Brush, in an email:', 'That sound became more common after the pandemic hit the U.S. and millions more people simultaneously connected to Slack, as Butterfield described in a series of tweets.', 'At the same time, Microsoft Teams, Zoom and other collaboration products were confronted with millions of new users. These people have only been exposed to the products during the pandemic, and that might leave a negative impression — which could be alleviated with new sounds.', '“Maybe after we get back, Zoom may want to do a rebranding on kind of their image entirely, because they were the company that was kind of at the epicenter of this entire movement,” said Taylor, the podcast host. (Zoom didn’t respond to requests for comment.)', '“I think they should consider, ‘How do we rebrand to where this company isn’t associated with the pandemic forever?’ It might be interesting if maybe Slack did something similarly — they have a pretty iconic notification sound now.”', 'Moore said he did reach out to Slack and got the sense that the company was receptive but wasn’t ready for an overhaul. The company confirmed that’s right, at least for now.', '“We’re not planning to change the default notification sound in Slack — the knock brush is a unique and iconic part of our brand,” said Ethan Eismann, Slack’s vice president of product design, in a statement provided by a spokesperson.', 'WATCH: Meet the man who designed Apple’s most iconic sounds']"

But SpaceX backed out last year, a move that L.A.

The VSS Enterprise was destroyed in a fatal test flight accident in 2014, while the VSS Unity has flown two spaceflights, most recently in February 2019. Colglazier emphasized that VSS Imagine “has been designed in a way that’s taken the learnings we’ve had from all the flight testing on Unity.”', '“That allows us to access things in the right way — we know what things need to be tackled on a routine basis, so that we can give people easy access,” Colglazier said.', 'Shares of Virgin Galactic rose about 2% in trading from its previous close of $29.21 a share.', 'Colglazier said the VSS Imagine is the first of the company’s SpaceShip III generation, adding that it is already it is “pivoting the manufacturing team to get to work” on the next spacecraft, which has been named VSS Inspire.

Facebook is also showing sensitivity to privacy concerns, giving users an easy way to cover the camera and turn off the microphones when not using the device.', 'While tech mega-cap peers Google, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft have experienced varying degrees of success with consumer devices, Facebook has failed to find much of a customer base. Last year, the company released the Portal and Portal+ video chat smart speakers powered by Amazon Alexa, but sales were minimal. Facebook said in July that second-quarter revenue in the payments and other fees segment, which includes Oculus virtual reality headsets and Portal devices, rose 36% to $262 million, accounting for less than 2% of total sales.', 'Selling the combination of a smart speaker and video-streaming product gets Facebook closer to an all-purpose streaming service as it goes up against stiff competition.

The faster speed is now available on more than 10 million products across the country with no minimum purchase required.', 'A big part of this fast shipping process is getting the package that last mile to each address. Amazon Flex uses on-demand contract drivers to help with this especially labor-intensive and expensive hand-delivery.', 'Flex was launched in 2015, and now operates in about 50 U.S. cities. Anyone over 21 with a driver’s license, auto insurance and at least a midsize sedan can sign up. After clearing a basic background check, drivers in areas with open spots can start picking up and delivering packages.', 'CNBC spent a day delivering with Flex driver Omar Montes in the San Francisco Bay Area, where he helped a friend deliver around 46 packages in 3½ hours, for $105.', '“These are like the good days that make you want to continue doing Amazon. But, you know, there’s obviously bad days too,” Montes said.', 'Last year, Amazon also brought on small-business partners and bought 20,000 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans for them to use for delivery. These two programs are part of Amazon’s larger move to grow its own logistics network, relying less on other carriers like UPS, the U.S. Postal Service, and FedEx — which just announced it wouldn’t renew its express U.S. contract with Amazon.', 'Amazon would not disclose how many drivers have signed up, or what percentage of its last-mile deliveries are made by Flex drivers compared with its shipping partners. But it did tell us the program is expanding.', '“We’ve built out these small-businesses delivery service providers and we have Flex which is our on-demand crowdsource delivery. So we need all of that to meet the various types of delivery we do in each of our geographies and I think you’re going to see expansion on all fronts there,” said Dave Clark, senior vice president of worldwide operations at Amazon.', 'Flex drivers use the Flex app to sign up for a “block” — which ranges from three to six hours — then head to a fulfillment center, where they find out how many boxes they’ve been assigned to deliver in that time frame. Amazon advertises that drivers make $18 to $25 an hour. Flex drivers are responsible for their own vehicle costs like gas, tolls and maintenance.', 'Depending on how long a block actually takes to deliver, drivers said the jobs are not always worthwhile.', '“If I spent three-hours-plus of my time, that’s just doing the block. Then who knows how long it will take me to get back. And all I made was 70 bucks, and half of that might go to expenses like gas and like the bridge,” Montes said.', 'But drivers in less-congested regions, including Arizona, Kentucky and New Jersey, told CNBC that they often finish deliveries early, making the pace relaxed and the hourly pay much higher, because you’re paid for the full block no matter how long it takes you.', '“You just might have just the one package in your three-hour block. That’s done in 20 minutes. So that’s rare but it happens, and it’s just a nice little thing to happen to folks driving,” said Quan Tsang, an Amazon Flex driver in Irvine, California.', 'Other drivers told CNBC they had safety concerns, from the Flex app encouraging distracted driving, to a lack of Amazon-branded clothing that leads to confrontations with confused customers.', 'Amazon told CNBC that “Safety is our number one priority. We communicate with delivery partners regarding safety topics, including safe loading practices. The vast majority of drivers complete their routes safely in less than the allotted time.”', '“Amazon provides delivery partners with 24/7 on road support,” the company said. “If delivery partners come across issues while making a delivery, we work with them directly on a resolution.', 'CNBC spoke to a total of 11 Flex drivers around the country to find out what it’s really like to deliver for Amazon, and how it compares to other gig jobs like driving for Uber, Lyft, Postmates or Doordash.

It is the second-biggest mining destination on the planet, accounting for nearly 17% of all the world’s bitcoin miners as of April 2021. That’s a 151% increase from September 2020. ', '“For the last 18 months, we’ve had a serious growth of mining infrastructure in the U.S.,” said Darin Feinstein, founder of Blockcap and Core Scientific. “We’ve noticed a massive uptick in mining operations looking to relocate to North America, mostly in the U.S.”', 'This dataset doesn’t include the mass mining exodus out of China, which led to half the world’s miners dropping offline, and experts tell CNBC that the U.S. share of the mining market is likely even bigger than the numbers indicate.', 'According to the newly-released Cambridge data, just before the Chinese mining ban began, the country accounted for 46% of the world’s total hashrate, an industry term used to describe the collective computing power of the bitcoin network. That’s a sharp decline from 75.5% in September 2019, and the percentage is likely much lower given the exodus underway now. ', '“500,000 formerly Chinese miner rigs are looking for homes in the U.S,” said Marathon Digital’s Fred Thiel. “If they are deployed, it would mean North America would have closer to 40% of global hashrate by the end of 2022.”', 'America’s rising dominance is a simple case of luck meeting preparation. The U.S. has quietly been building up its hosting capacity for years.', 'Before bitcoin miners actually started coming to America, companies across the country made a gamble that eventually, if adequate infrastructure were in place, they would set up shop in the U.S. ', 'That gamble appears to be paying off.', 'When bitcoin crashed in late 2017 and the wider market entered a multi-year crypto winter, there wasn’t much demand for big bitcoin farms. U.S. mining operators saw their opening and jumped at the chance to deploy cheap money to build up the mining ecosystem in the States. ', '“The large, publicly traded miners were able to raise capital to go make big purchases,” said Mike Colyer, CEO of digital currency company Foundry, which helped bring over $300 million of mining equipment into North America.', 'Companies like North American crypto mining operator Core Scientific kept building out hosting space all through the crypto winter, so that they had the capacity to plug in new gear, according to Colyer. ', '“A majority of the new equipment manufactured from May 2020 through December 2020 was shipped to the U.S. and Canada,” he said.', 'Alex Brammer of Luxor Mining, a cryptocurrency pool built for advanced miners, points out that maturing capital markets and financial instruments around the mining industry also played a big role in the industry’s quick ascent in the U.S. Brammer says that many of these American operators were able to start rapidly expanding once they secured financing by leveraging a multi-year track record of profitability and existing capital as collateral.', 'Covid also played a role.', 'Though the global pandemic shut down large swaths of the economy, the ensuing stimulus payments that proved a boon for U.S. mining companies.', '“All the money printing during the pandemic meant that more capital needed to be deployed,” explained bitcoin mining engineer Brandon Arvanaghi. ', '“People were looking for places to park their cash. The appetite for large-scale investments had never been bigger. A lot of that likely found its way into bitcoin mining operations in places outside of China,” continued Arvanaghi.', 'The seeds of the U.S. migration started back in early 2020, according to Colyer. Prior to Beijing’s sudden crackdown, China’s mining dominance had already begun to slip. ', 'Part of the appeal is that the U.S. ticks a lot of the boxes for these migrant miners.', '“If you’re looking to relocate hundreds of millions of dollars of miners out of China, you want to make sure you have geographic, political, and jurisdictional stability. You also want to make sure there are private property right protections for the assets that you are relocating,” said Feinstein.', 'It also helps that the U.S. is also home to some of the cheapest sources of energy on the planet, many of which tend to be renewable. Because miners at scale compete in a low-margin industry, where their only variable cost is typically energy, they are incentivized to migrate to the world’s cheapest sources of power.', 'Thiel expects most new miners relocating to North America to be powered by renewables, or gas that is offset by renewable energy credits.', 'While Castle Island Ventures founding partner, Nic Carter, points out that U.S. mining isn’t wholly renewable, he does say that miners here are much better about selecting renewables and buying offsets. ', '“The migration is definitely a net positive overall,” he said. “Hashrate moving to the U.S., Canada, and Russia will mean much lower carbon intensity.”']"
56,The Panama Canal is a wonder of the modern world – here’s how it plans to reduce shipping emissions ,2018-08-23T07:06:27+0000,"['Roughly 80 kilometers long, the Panama Canal connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. A wonder of modern engineering and design, 13,000 to 14,000 vessels pass through the canal each year.  By reducing the distance ships need to travel to reach their destination, the canal helps to reduce fuel consumption and, in turn, greenhouse gas emissions. During its lifetime, it has helped prevent the emission of around more than 700 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2).  The shipping industry has an impact on the environment. In 2012, international shipping was responsible for an estimated 796 million tons of CO2 emissions — around 2.2 percent of total global CO2 emissions that year, according to the International Maritime Organization.  “The original Panama Canal was built between 1904 and 1914, a 10-year effort,” Jorge L. Quijano, CEO of the Panama Canal Authority, told CNBC’s “Sustainable Energy.”  “We are basically a short cut between the Atlantic and Pacific and to do this we use locks — so you go up 85 to 87 feet in elevation. Then you cross the continental divide on the lake (Gatun Lake) and you come down to zero-level elevation, which is… the Atlantic Ocean.”  The impact of the canal on the shipping industry has been significant — so much so that a specific type of cargo ship, the Panamax, has been designed to fit its dimensions. “It’s basically a vessel that’s 106 foot wide and… 965 foot long,” Quijano said.  Between 2009 and 2016, an extensive construction project saw the canal undergo a significant expansion when a third lane was built. This allows a larger type of vessel, the Neopanamax, to pass through. At the end of July, the 4,000th Neopanamax vessel transited through the expanded canal.  “We’re now looking at a vessel size that can carry as much as three times the numbers of containers that you could carry on the old Panamax locks,” Quijano said.']"

In one end go wood, pipes, tile, sinks and toilets; out another come individual apartments that can be trucked to a construction site and bolted together in months.', '“If we don’t build housing differently, then no one can have any housing,” Mr. Holliday said during a recent tour, as he passed assembly-line workstations and stacks of raw materials like windows, pipes and rolls of pink insulation.', 'More from the New York Times:California housing problems are spilling across its borders Rent control campaign in California is taken to the streetsThe great American single-family home problem  ', 'Almost a decade after the recession flattened the housing industry, causing waves of contractors to go bankrupt and laid-off construction workers to leave the business for other jobs, builders have yet to regain their previous form. Today the pace of new apartment and housing construction sits at a little over half the 2006 peak.', 'The United States needs new housing, but its building industry isn’t big enough to provide it. The number of residential construction workers is 23 percent lower than in 2006, while higher-skill trades like plumbers, carpenters and electricians are down close to 17 percent. With demand for housing high and the supply of workers short, builders are bidding up prices for the limited number of contractors.', 'Construction prices nationwide have risen about 5 percent a year for the past three years, according to the Turner Building Cost Index. Costs have gone up even faster in big cities and across California, according to RSMeans, a unit of Gordian, which compiles construction data.

City and state legislators have tried to tackle their housing problems with proposals to increase subsidized affordable housing, reduce building regulations and make it legal to build taller.', 'But even if every overpriced city suddenly overcame the thicket of zoning rules and neighborhood opposition that make it difficult to build new housing in the first place — which seems doubtful — today’s diminished building industry would lack the capacity to build at the needed pace. This affects the rich as well as the poor, because it raises the cost of high-end condos and affordable housing alike.', 'Later this year, California residents will vote on a proposed $4 billion bond to build more subsidized affordable housing. In San Francisco, where developers say the per-unit construction cost is edging toward $800,000, that would buy about 5,000 units, a relative blip. “Costs have risen so much that it is not possible to build homes where people want to live at the prices and rents they can afford,” said John Burns, founder of John Burns Real Estate Consulting.', 'All this has prompted developers like Mr. Holliday to go scrambling for cheaper and less labor-intensive construction methods — and investors to pour money into start-ups that promise to do just that. Katerra, a three-year-old prefabricated building company in the Silicon Valley city of Menlo Park, has raised $1.1 billion in venture capital. A number of other building start-ups including Blokable, based in Seattle; Kasita, based in Austin, Tex.; and RAD Urban, based in Oakland, Calif., have all popped up over the past five years.', '“The current system can’t meet demand and that’s resulting in a lack of opportunity for some folks and a major hit to the economy,” said Stonly Baptiste, a co-founder of Urban Us, a Brooklyn-based venture capital firm that invested in Blokable. “These aren’t small problems and they aren’t small markets.”', 'The technologies vary but generally involve simplifying construction through prefabricated panels that can be assembled like Ikea furniture and modular apartments that can be stacked together like Lego bricks. A recent survey by FMI, a management-consulting and investment banking company focused on the engineering and construction industry, found a third of respondents said they were looking at some form of off-site construction, a steep rise from 2010. The interest extends from housing to hotels to medical facilities, industrial companies and even fast-food restaurants.', '“It’s one of those things that looks like an overnight success but it’s taken 10 years and hundreds of people toiling,” said Chris Giattina, chief executive of BLOX, a Birmingham, Ala., company that builds hospitals with modular components.', 'The global construction industry is a $10 trillion behemoth whose structures determine where people live, how they get to work and what cities look like. It is also one of the world’s least efficient businesses. The construction productivity rate — how much building workers do for each hour of labor they put in — has been flat since 1945, according to the McKinsey Global Institute. Over that period, sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and retail saw their productivity rates surge by as much as 1,500 percent. In other words, while the rest of the economy has been supercharged by machines, computers and robots, construction companies are about as efficient as they were in World War II.', 'To understand this, consider how buildings are actually built. It all starts with the developer, who doesn’t actually build anything but instead secures a piece of land and a loan, and gets the project approved by the government. At that point the money is passed to the general contractor that made a successful bid to build the project, who passes it to subcontractors that won the bidding for things like plumbing and sheet metal work, which often pass it to even more subcontractors.', 'Contractors describe this handoff as “brokering risk.” What they mean is that while everyone in the chain has agreed to build a certain piece of the project for a set amount of money and in a given amount of time, none of them are sure they can do so as cheaply or quickly as they’ve promised. They broker that risk by paying someone else to do it for them, minus a small fee.', '“Say you’re a general contractor and your subcontractor agrees to do a job. Once we have a contract I don’t care how many man hours you put into it because that’s your problem now,” said Randy Miller, chief executive of RAD Urban, describing the thinking behind the process.', 'The goal of prefabricated building companies is to turn this model on its head. Instead of offloading risk, the contractor assumes all of it. Instead of sending jobs to subcontractors, they hire their own factory workers. “The general contractor says, ‘Oh my God, construction is scary, let me broker all that risk,’” Mr. Miller said. “I’m saying, ’Oh my God, construction is scary, let me plan and control it.”', 'The basic concept isn’t new. In 1624, Massachusetts settlers built homes out of prefabricated materials shipped from England. The pattern was repeated in Australia, Africa and India as the British Empire shipped colonists and structures wide across the globe, according to “Prefab Architecture,” by Ryan E. Smith, a professor at the University of Utah.', 'Over the next few centuries, new versions of the idea seemed to pop up anywhere people needed to build lots of homes in a hurry — during the California Gold Rush, after the Chicago fire, and through America’s westward expansion. In the early part of the 20th century, Sears sold tens of thousands of kits for Sears Modern Homes, which consisted of prefabricated parts and panels that buyers assembled.', 'Along the way, the construction industry absorbed manufacturing concepts such as the assembly-line techniques that were utilized by Levitt & Sons, the pioneer of mass-built subdivisions. But the idea of factory-built housing was never adopted long or widely enough to make an impact, at least in the United States.', 'One reason the United States has lagged behind Europe, Australia and Asia — which all have well-established companies doing modular and prefabricated building — is that it is a predominantly suburban nation, and the vast supply of open land has kept the cost of single-family-home building relatively low. Another is that the construction industry has slim profit margins and invests little in research and development.', 'The chances of being burned are high, and each high-profile failure leads to a furlough of the concept. In the mid-2000s housing boom, Pulte Homes, one of the country’s largest builders, opened a prefabrication plant that aimed to revolutionize how homes were built. The company closed it with the onset of the housing bust in 2007.', 'Now, instead of single-family homes, companies doing prefab building are focusing on higher-density condominiums and apartments. That’s because, while single-family home construction remains well below its level before the recession, multifamily condominium and apartment buildings have rebounded strongly. “Our goal is to be able to do a 40-story tower in 12 months, at half the cost of traditional construction,” said Mr. Miller of RAD Urban.', 'Still, even if builders are able to reduce construction costs, that doesn’t necessarily mean they will be successful. Behind each of these companies is a bet that they can build far more efficiently than current methods. That bet has yet to be proven, at least on a large scale.', 'Mr. Holliday of Factory OS started thinking about modular housing about four years ago, when he was struggling to build a project in Truckee, Calif., a mountain town of about 15,000 people near Lake Tahoe. The idea was to build a cluster of 800 to 1,000 high-density apartments and condominiums, but “the numbers wouldn’t work,” he said. “You couldn’t get the construction costs down enough.”', 'Mr. Holliday floated the idea of modular building to his longtime contractor, Larry Pace, from Cannon Constructors, who over the past four decades has built various projects from one-off homes to high-rise condo and office towers. “I said ‘modular jobs have been a fiasco — we don’t need that in our lives,’” Mr. Pace recalled, adding an expletive for emphasis.', 'But Mr. Holliday persisted, and he and Mr. Pace used modular technology from two manufacturers to build four projects in the Bay Area. They are planning to do the same with the original Truckee development. Mr. Pace became so comfortable with modular that he suggested that they find some investors and build a factory of their own.', 'On a recent afternoon, Mr. Pace laid out the factory’s process. At the first station, just past the door, four workers toiled above and below a raised platform to build what would eventually become the floor. The two men up top laid down flooring while a man and woman stood below simultaneously installing pipes.', 'From there the unit would move steadily down the line, and, over 21 additional stations, would acquire toilets, indoor walls, outdoor walls, a roof, electric outlets, windows, sinks, countertops and tiling. It takes about a week to finish a unit, Mr. Pace said. The goal is to churn out about 2,000 apartments a year, which would be turned into four- and five-story buildings with 80 to 150 units each.', 'For workers, factory building seems to mean lower wages but steadier work. Factory OS pays about $30 an hour with medical insurance and two weeks of vacation. That’s about half what workers can make on a construction site, but the work is more regular and, for many, requires less commuting.', 'Tony Vandewark, a 51-year-old foreman at Factory OS, is OK with the trade-off. Mr. Vandewark lives a few minutes from the factory in Vallejo, where homes cost less than half what they do closer to San Francisco. Contrast that with a job he once had in the Silicon Valley city of Sunnyvale. Mr. Vandewark drove two hours to work and three hours home before deciding to rent a room so he could stay closer to work on weekdays.', '“On a job site, you can go do piece work and make really big money, but then the job is gone,” he said.', 'In addition to not being rained on, one of the key differences between a construction site and Factory OS is that any worker can be trained to do any job. And for old-school trade unions, that is a declaration of war. “The business model is ‘Hooray for me,‘” without regard for anyone else, said Larry Mazzola Jr., business manager of UA Local 38, a San Francisco plumbers’ union with about 2,500 members across Northern California.', 'Factory OS is not anti-union: It has a contract with the Northern California Carpenters Regional Council, which has organized other modular factories and is banking on the technology’s continued growth. The issue is that builders are laid out like a Detroit auto factory, where one union represents all of the workers, and workers can be trained to do any job within the company walls.', 'That is a huge departure from construction sites, where unions representing plumbers, electricians, carpenters and various other trades each control their piece of the building process. Last year Mr. Mazzola wrote a letter to San Francisco’s mayor, Ed Lee, a month before he died, urging him to deny any city business — such as contracts for subsidized housing — to Factory OS.', '“Any decision to use Factory OS shows a blatant disregard for the other craft unions,” he wrote. He asked the mayor to refrain from contracting with the company unless it allowed craft unions to do their pieces of the work. “We realize modular is coming and we want to be part of it, but not at the expense of our workers, which is what’s happening right now,” Mr. Mazzola said in an interview.', 'Jay Bradshaw, director of organizing for the carpenters’ council representing Factory OS workers, said that would be impractical. Think back to that first station, where four people worked above and below the floor. In Mr. Mazzola’s world, a plumbers’ union would represent the workers installing pipes, while other unions would represent the workers up top.', '“It would never work to have upward of 10 or 15 labor organizations at a single employer in a factory setting,” Mr. Bradshaw said.', 'For Mr. Bradshaw, the real fight isn’t defending job titles but making sure construction workers remain part of a union at all. A short drive from Factory OS, at a carpenters’ training center, the union is developing a program to train housing-factory workers — something that, it hopes, will prepare more people for an industry that it has come to see as inevitable.', '“It sure blows the hell out of building in China,” he said.']"
61,Here’s how sails and liquefied natural gas could transform the shipping industry,2018-07-13T07:24:49+0000,"['The shipping industry plays a crucial role in the running of the global economy and like any major sector, it has an environmental impact.', 'In 2012, international shipping was responsible for an estimated 796 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions — around 2.2 percent of total global CO2 emissions that year, according to the International Maritime Organization.  In northern Europe, Finnish shipping business Viking Line is looking to mitigate its environmental footprint with innovative design.  “The Viking Grace is a  passenger cruise ferry operating between Turku in Finland and Stockholm in Sweden,” Kaj Takolander, vice president and head of sales and marketing at Viking Line, told CNBC’s “Sustainable Energy.”  Takolander added that the ship was 218 meters long and carried a combination of passengers, cars and freight. He explained that the vessel was powered by four main engines built by Wartsila. “We use gas as the fuel, but we have a spare system for diesel in case of problems with gas supply,” he said, adding that each engine has more than 10,000 horsepower.  The Viking Grace is something of a trailblazer — the first passenger ship of its size to run on sulphur-free liquefied natural gas (LNG), according to Viking Line. “The benefit with LNG is that the emissions are up to 85 percent lower than with an ordinary, traditional diesel engine,” Takolander said. “The sulphur emissions are much lower.”  The ship also uses an innovative sail system, a 24-meter-tall cylindrical rotor sail developed by Norsepower Oy, another Finnish company. The sail uses something called the “Magnus effect” for propulsion, according to Viking Line. As the rotor spins, passing air flows with a lower pressure on one side compared to the other. This difference in pressure creates a propulsion force that moves the ship forward.  Altogether, these new innovations and ideas are helping to reduce the ship’s environmental impact. “Our decision to test this technology is based on… simulations that show that we can save up to 300 tons of fuel,” Takolander said, “meaning we can cut CO2 emissions (by)… 900 tons a year.”']"

Colleran connected Parker to the right people at Facebook to clear up the matter and get PillPack off what the investor called “the naughty list.”', '“Once they got on Facebook, it helped escalate their growth more than other platforms,” said Colleran, who also became close friends with Parker.', 'Then consumers caught on. By the time of last year’s acquisition, the business was on track to generate $299 million in annual revenue, with plans to more than double in 2019 to $635 million before reaching $1.2 billion in 2020, according to a pitch deck viewed by CNBC. Those are big numbers for a company founded just five years earlier, and proved there was plenty of demand for what PillPack was offering.', 'But PillPack was burning through $6 million a month at its peak because of the low profit margins and escalating costs of expansion. Some of the high expenses were tied to the development of a back-end software system called PharmacyOS, which the company was designing to automate the process of prescription renewals, billing insurance, getting authorizations from providers and sending out notifications. David Frankel, an early PillPack backer, calls it the “spaghetti connectivity” of the pharmacy world.', 'Parker knew in 2016 that Amazon was interested in the space through conversations with executives at the company, according to people with knowledge of the talks. Amazon was also dabbling around the edges of the market and would soon start hiring business leaders focused on pharmacy and selling things like at-home DNA tests and over-the-counter medicines.', 'Having already raised $115 million, including a $60 million round in mid-2016, PillPack needed more capital to keep the business afloat. Parker was gearing up to raise more cash had the deal with Amazon or another bidder not materialized.', 'By early 2018, it was becoming clear that Amazon could be an ally or a competitor. Parker chose the former option.', 'For Amazon, which recorded over $230 billion in sales last year, PillPack doesn’t move the needle at its current size. The value for Amazon is in the promise of plugging the delivery network into the giant e-commerce machine, especially when considering that the average PillPack user in 2018 was worth $5,000 in revenue, through insurance payments and patient co-pays, according to the slide presentation.', 'That’s far more than the average Prime member, who spends about $1,300 a year on Amazon after the $119 annual subscription, according to a 2017 study. Also, most of PillPack’s users are in their 50s and 60s and they’re loyal customers, giving Amazon an older demographic to target with other product promotions. You could imagine signing in to order your blood-thinning medication and seeing a recommendation for shaving cream, toilet paper or nail polish, all things you’d been buying at the store.', 'Amazon is already using that tactic in reverse, promoting the PillPack service to a targeted group of Prime subscribers. But Amazon can provide a whole lot more to PillPack than access to 100 million-plus Prime users.', 'One effort underway involves large insurers, who could offer the mail-order service as a perk to their members, and in return provide the company with potentially millions of new customers.', 'According to a confidential document viewed by CNBC, Blue Cross Blue Shield, a federation of 36 health insurance plans that cover more than 100 million Americans, has reached out to PillPack about providing the service to members. While no deal has materialized, the document says Blue Cross would provide home delivery and other benefits as well as discounts on over-the-counter drugs and possibly a branded medication dispenser.', 'A Blue Cross spokesperson declined to comment.', 'Amazon can also add the muscle PillPack needs to stand up to the PBMs, which effectively determine whether a pharmacy is able to get customers. Large employers, insurers and Medicare and Medicaid rely on PBMs to administer prescription coverage, and PBMs have not looked kindly on start-ups delivering medications to the home because many offer their own lucrative mail-order services.', 'In 2016, Express Scripts, the largest PBM, threatened to remove PillPack from its network, claiming the company was misrepresenting itself as a retail pharmacy instead of a mail-delivery pharmacy. The move would have cut PillPack off from about a third of its customers virtually overnight.', '“There were many, many attempts to crush this company,” said Jim Messina, a former White House deputy chief of staff under Barack Obama who was hired by PillPack to navigate the challenges presented by PBMs.', 'Messina, who joined PillPack’s board in November 2017 along with former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, laid out an aggressive campaign that involved setting up the website fixpharmacy.com to rally support from existing customers in an effort to reach key policymakers in Washington. Parker set up a war room at the office, where top staffers put in 16-hour days on the #fixpharmacy crusade. In just over a week, the marketing team, led by former IDEO executive Colin Raney, published multiple videos featuring customers talking about their dependence on the service.', 'tweet', 'TJ will “go to war and fight for his company and try to do things differently,” Messina said.', 'However, Express Scripts did have a case. The company had given PillPack a contract to sell as a retail pharmacy, and not by mail. PillPack had some physical locations but it was shipping medications to patients from those pharmacies. Express Scripts eventually agreed to give a mail-order contract to PillPack (which is still in effect), but not before Parker fessed up to an “administrative error” that resulted in the company briefly shipping to states where it wasn’t properly licensed.', 'Brian Henry, a spokesman for Express Scripts, told Forbes at the time that, “there are standards and regulations and industry practices you have to follow.” He declined to provide further comment to CNBC.', 'Parker’s history with Express Scripts and unwillingness to back down from a fight was one of the qualities that most attracted Amazon to PillPack, according to people familiar with the matter.', '“He thought that the only way to make a change is to shine a light on the dark spots, and he had the information on where those dark spots were,” said Zachariah Reitano, CEO of men’s health start-up Roman, which counts Parker as an investor. “He did it in a way where it benefited the patient, and not just for the benefit of his company.”', 'PillPack is just a piece of Amazon’s expansive plan to uproot the $3 trillion U.S. health-care industry. The company is also working with J.P. Morgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway on a joint venture called Haven aiming to improve care and bring down the costs. It has plans to open its own health clinics for employees, and there’s a secretive group called Grand Challenge working on telemedicine and applying machine learning to cancer research, among other futuristic projects. Then there’s Amazon Web Services and the Alexa voice division, which have various efforts underway to pull together medical records and mine data.', 'But for all the indigestion Amazon has created in the pharmaceutical and health-care industries, the company doesn’t appear to have any grand plan yet to take on the market. Cohen spoke at a recent investment bank event and told those in the crowd that there’s no single person in Seattle who owns the health efforts, according to a person who was in attendance.', 'The immediate objective for PillPack is to keep growing and hiring. The company didn’t insist on retaining its brand permanently as part of the acquisition, according to a person familiar with the transaction, so it could eventually be renamed to something like Amazon Pharmacy.', 'Amazon is staffing up the business to serve tens of thousands more customers and adding the necessary pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. Amazon has about 50 PillPack job openings listed on its careers site, primarily in Boston and Somerville. Some of the most recent listings are for a packing and shipping specialist and visual designer, and more than half the positions are in software development, including for a “team lead,” tasked with “establishing mechanisms and best practices for a growing team.”', 'PillPack has bolstered ad spending on TV stations (including CNBC and MSNBC) that reach an older audience, as well as across digital networks like Facebook.', 'It’s also forging ahead with plans already in place in Phoenix to build out a 175,000-square-foot pharmacy operation, which is about the size of a Walmart Supercenter, to serve as a retail pharmacy and distribution center. The facility has been adding state licenses that will allow PillPack to better serve customers in the western U.S.', 'When the acquisition was disclosed in June, some analysts speculated that Amazon wanted PillPack because it had pharmacy licenses in almost every state. The consulting firm Kantar said PillPack’s 49 licenses make it “incredibly asset-rich.”', 'In Arizona, PillPack has been lobbying local officials to allow pharmacy technicians, the people who assist pharmacists, to transfer medications from other pharmacies into PillPack. A handful of employees and a PillPack lawyer showed up at an Arizona State Board of Pharmacy meeting in December to request an exemption from a law that requires pharmacists to handle transfers that come in by phone. PillPack’s representatives said the company already uses technicians for those tasks in New Hampshire (one of the 13 states that allow it) and has a rigorous training program and oversight in place to ensure patient safety.', 'The PillPack crew didn’t talk about cost savings or the need to rapidly scale, but you could hear the Amazon influence in their argument. For PillPack to function like an Amazon business, it has to get the most of both technology and lower-cost employees. The company was granted a six-month exemption, after which it has to produce a report on findings and error rates.', 'Since the acquisition last June, Parker has relocated to Park City, Utah, near the company’s sales and business development office. On most Tuesdays, he flies to Seattle, where he recently bought a house, and stays until Thursday.', 'He continues to work closely with Kabbani, who has facilitated introductions between PillPack’s team and top Amazon executives in areas like AWS and Haven, people familiar with the matter said.', 'Though Parker and Cohen report to Kabbani, the founders are very much the ones leading the charge. Kabbani is a respected manager who has risen through the ranks at Amazon, helping build the Kindle self-publishing platform and then leading a variety of last-mile delivery projects, including Flex, the on-demand delivery hiring service. But he doesn’t have much experience in health care or drug supply chain, a fact he made clear to the PillPack team during the acquisition talks, according to people familiar with the discussions.', 'Kabbani’s logistics expertise is likely to play into PillPack’s effort to expand its on-the-ground presence. The company has physical pharmacies in five states — New Hampshire, New York, Texas, Florida and Arizona — which it needs to legally ship to all the various states and so it can deliver quickly, without having to send packages across the country.', 'Cohen’s focus has largely been on PharmacyOS, which PillPack launched in 2017 as a “brand new operating system that we built from the ground up,” replacing lots of old, off-the-shelf technology.', 'According to an internal presentation PillPack executives created before the Amazon deal, the company was pitching PharmacyOS as its next big growth driver, and two people familiar with the matter said it was one of the main pieces that interested Amazon. PillPack has been trying to get the technology in the hands of pharmaceutical makers, doctors and insurance companies to automate and streamline their processes as well, so it’s not just used internally.', '“Such a move would mean they’re expanding far beyond their core solution to the tens of millions of people who take generic medicines,” said Stephen Buck, a former vice president at drug distributor McKesson, after CNBC described the document. Buck, who’s now CEO of health-tech start-up Courage Health, said it suggests that “PillPack is going to be a much bigger player in pharmacy.”', 'Just after the deal came together and before taking up his new post in Seattle, Parker wanted to celebrate. He invited some friends and their family members to his home in the Boston suburb of Somerville, a short walk from PillPack’s headquarters, to enjoy a summer barbecue.', 'Parker and Cohen cooked steaks and veggies on the grill in the garden. Meanwhile, Kabbani took a seat at the piano in the living room and entertained the kids in attendance with classical music. Destin, the early investor, was there with his 12-year-old son, who showed off some of his card tricks. The boy was such a hit with Kabbani that the Amazon executive jokingly offered him a job.', '“It didn’t feel like a commercial transaction,” said Destin, the founder of venture firm Stride.VC. “It felt like a family barbecue and that touched me. It reminded me that it’s about people having faith in other people and taking risks on their behalf.”', 'WATCH: PillPack’s CEO spoke with CNBC two years before the Amazon deal']"

The small vials are traveling on airplanes and trucks, and some times inside of specially made hand-held coolers.', 'So far, two vaccines have been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use in the U.S.: those by Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna. Several other drugmakers also have agreements to provide their vaccines to the federal government once they are approved. AstraZeneca’s vaccine, developed with Oxford University, was just approved for emergency use in the U.K. but is still in clinical trials in the U.S.', 'The much-awaited vaccines — and whether they’re distributed quickly, smoothly and widely — will help determine whether the U.S. can gain control of a virus that’s killed more than 355,000 people across the country, overwhelmed hospitals and thrust the nation’s economy into a recession.', 'Health-care workers and nursing home residents were among the first to receive them in mid-December, followed by older Americans or those considered more at risk based on their job, age or medical conditions, depending on the state. The U.S. has distributed just over 17 million doses, and 4.8 million people have been given their first shot as of Tuesday — far short of the country’s original goal of immunizing at least 20 million people by the end of 2020.', 'Eventually, the shots will be available to the general public at neighborhood pharmacies and grocery stores.', 'Here’s how that journey looks for the vaccines:', 'Within hours of the FDA’s approval of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines last month, FedEx and United Parcel Service started shipping vials of doses. The logistics rivals teamed up and split deliveries by state, UPS Healthcare President Wes Wheeler told a Senate panel at a hearing last month.', 'Delivering coronavirus vaccines, however, isn’t first time the companies have handled sensitive medical products. UPS provided logistical support throughout Pfizer’s clinical trials. FedEx delivers flu vaccines every year and shipped over 80 million H1N1 vaccine doses in 2009, said Richard Smith, FedEx Express executive vice president.', '“This is what we were built for, and we plan for things like this regularly,” Smith told lawmakers. “Maybe not on this scale with all of the ins and outs, but we are well-versed in this type of planning.”', 'Pfizer’s vaccine is being transported in custom thermal shippers designed to keep the doses at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit. Each suitcase-sized box can hold 4,875 doses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The shippers also have a GPS-enabled thermal sensor.', 'Ensuring the vials are kept at the right temperature is a tricky process that’s had to be adjusted along the way. U.S. officials quarantined several thousand doses of Pfizer’s vaccine in California and Alabama in mid-December after an “anomaly” in the transportation process caused the storage temperature to get too cold.', 'After leaving Pfizer’s storage sites in Michigan and Wisconsin, Covid vaccine shipments receive priority treatment, UPS and FedEx said.', 'Vaccine packages that UPS delivers are given a gold priority label embedded with four trackers so the company can see the package as soon as it arrives at every destination. Each of its trucks also has a device that monitors its location, light exposure and temperature. Those vaccines are transferred to UPS’ Worldport facilities in Louisville, Kentucky, where they are immediately expedited.', '“We will see the package; it will get priority,” Wheeler said. “It goes on the plane first. It comes off the plane first.”', 'UPS created a 24/7 command center just for vaccine shipments where employees monitor the shipments and intercept a package if something goes wrong, Wheeler said. Similar to UPS, FedEx’s “priority alert” team actively tracks the shipments using its own technology.', 'Passenger airlines also play a role. Even before Pfizer’s vaccine was cleared by the FDA, United Airlines started shipping doses on Boeing 777s from Brussels, near the pharmaceutical giant’s Belgium plant to the carrier’s hub at Chicago O’Hare. They were taken by truck from the airport to Pfizer’s plant in Kalamazoo, Michigan to position them for distribution.', 'American Airlines ran trial flights in November between Miami and South America to stress test thermal packaging and handling before it started shipping the vaccines.', 'Last month, United and Delta Air Lines started shipping smaller loads of the vaccine in the bellies of passenger planes within the U.S.', 'Airplanes carrying the vaccine get takeoff and landing priority from the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA also gave United special approval to carry more dry ice than typically allowed to transport doses from Brussels to Chicago.', 'The airlines and logistics companies had mobilized extra manpower last month as a snowstorm swept through the Northeast and threatened to shut down runways. The FAA urged airports to have people ready to clear snow.', 'Shipments from FedEx and UPS head to different hubs for distribution. In some cases, they arrive at hospitals or health-care systems where they are stored and later administered to staff. In other cases, they head to retail pharmacies.', 'UT Health Austin received notice on Dec. 12 that it would receive its first shipment of 2,925 doses of vaccine the next day, said Dr. Amy Young, chief clinical office. It had already received supplies needed for administering the shot, like syringes and alcohol swabs, about a week before, said Young, who also is vice dean of professional practice at Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin.', 'When the shipment arrived via FedEx truck, hospital staff checked the temperature of the doses at the facility’s loading dock to make sure they remained at the necessary temperature, Young said. They then transported the boxes to their ultra-cold freezer for the night. Hospital staff started immunizing people the next day.', 'Riverside Health System in Virginia, which received its first shipment of just under 3,000 doses on Dec. 15, followed a similar process, said Cindy Williams, vice president and chief pharmacy officer. Riverside was able to track the FedEx shipment as it arrived at a nearby airport.', '“We did, in fact, get notification that it was on the ground and within about an hour or so it was pulling into our loading dock,” Williams said.', 'Though Riverside predicted the first week of vaccinations would have a slow start, the process was much more efficient, Williams said.', '“We are ramping things up pretty rapidly, and we’re also finding that team members are very willing to step up and sign up for the clinics,” Williams said.', 'The special containers for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines also act as mobile freezers for clinics that don’t have specialty equipment. They can be stored for up to 30 days if they’re refilled with dry ice every five days.', 'The vaccine developed by Moderna must be kept frozen — but not at the ultra-low temperatures required for Pfizer’s shots. Moderna’s needs to be stored at between negative 13 and 5 degrees Fahrenheit and protected from light, according to CDC guidelines.', 'Moderna’s vaccine, however, can be stored in the refrigerator at between 36 and 46 degrees Fahrenheit for up to 30 days.', 'UPS is producing its own dry ice — over 24,000 pounds a day — for anyone who needs it for the vaccines.', 'Walgreens and CVS Health have turned some of their drugstores into designated hubs with special freezers, dry ice and staff trained about how to handle the vaccines. The federal government tapped the companies to inoculate residents and staff at nursing homes and assisted living facilities across the country.', '“Once we get them into those hubs, that’s where the planning really works locally with the states, with the long-term care facilities and with our field teams,” said Rick Gates, Walgreens’ senior vice president of pharmacy and health care.', 'About 10% of CVS pharmacies are serving as “hubs” or “depots,” said Chris Cox, a senior vice president at CVS and a liaison to Operation Warp Speed, the federal effort to help develop, make and distribute Covid vaccines.', '“There’s nothing special about these pharmacies other than their geographic proximity to the most number of nursing homes, so that we can really optimize our routes,” he said.', 'Pharmacists and technicians at long-term care facilities wait until the morning of the vaccinations to move the Pfizer-BioNTech inoculations from ultra-cold storage and into a refrigerator, where it thaws, Cox said. The doses can be stored in a regular refrigerator at 35 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit for up to five days, according to Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine fact sheet.', 'They are then loaded into a specially made small, hand-held cooler designed to maintain that temperature for up to 24 hours.', 'The Moderna vaccine must remain frozen for transport. It’s then carried in the same cooler — but with cooling inserts and is thawed on-site at the facility before it is administered, Cox said.', 'Each cooler can hold 500 Pfizer doses or 1,000 Moderna doses since the Pfizer shots come in smaller bottles, according to CVS. Before giving the shot, health-care staff must add a saline solution to Pfizer’s dose before it’s injected, while Moderna’s vaccine doesn’t need to be diluted.', 'Both vaccines need to be thawed before injecting and cannot be refrozen, putting unused doses at risk of going bad. Pfizer’s vaccine takes 30 minutes and Moderna’s vaccine takes an hour to thaw at room temperature, a CVS spokesman said.', 'Both vaccines also need to be used relatively quickly after thawing. Undiluted vials of Pfizer’s vaccine cannot be stored at room temperature for more than two hours. Once diluted, they need to be used within six hours.', 'Moderna’s vaccine is stable at room temperature for up to 12 hours if the vials haven’t been punctured and six hours once they’ve been punctured.', 'Reports of unused and discarded doses have started to trickle in across the country as local health departments struggle to meet the tricky dosing requirements.', 'Authorities in Wisconsin said they arrested a pharmacist last week after he admitted to removing 57 vials containing 500 doses of Moderna’s vaccine from a pharmacy refrigerator and intentionally allowing them to spoil.', 'The vaccine’s final stop is the same: jabbed into millions of American arms.', 'Teams of pharmacists from CVS and Walgreens are administering the vaccines at more than 70,000 long-term care facilities, including nursing homes, according to CVS Chief Medical Officer Dr. Troyen Brennan. The size of the teams will vary based on the number of staff and residents.', 'At nursing homes, pharmacists in protective gear go room by room to vaccinate residents who have agreed to be inoculated, Cox said. At facilities where residents are more mobile, they’ll have a central on-site clinic. They’ll also vaccinate staff.', 'Those vaccinations began Dec. 18 in Ohio, Connecticut and Florida. They are now available in nursing homes in almost every state and the District of Columbia.', 'CVS and Walgreens, are nudging people to return for their second shot with phone calls, emails and text messages as well as reminder cards. Doses must be spaced out properly — 21 days for the Pfizer vaccine and 28 days for the Moderna vaccine.', 'U.K. health officials have decided to implement a 12-week delay between the first and second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines in order to cover as much of the population as possible.', 'U.S. health officials, who haven’t approved AstraZeneca’s vaccine yet, have advised against any changes in the dosing schedules, although Trump administration vaccine czar Moncef Slaoui said they are considering cutting Moderna’s dose in half for younger people to increase its availability.', 'The distribution has been slow going, hampered by the holidays, manufacturing delays and funding shortfalls and glitches in state programs designed to administer the shots to people. Roughly 4.8 million doses have been distributed to long-term care facilities, but just 429,066 shots have been given as of Tuesday morning, according to the CDC.', 'CVS and Walgreens executives still think the shots could be available to all Americans at their nearby grocery store or drugstore as early as March, much like they are for the seasonal flu. More than a dozen retail chains and pharmacies, including Kroger, Walmart and Costco, have signed on as partners with the federal government to give the shots. Some of them, such as Walmart, say they’re already getting staff and freezers ready — even as they wait for doses to arrive.', 'CNBC’s Leslie Josephs, Kevin Stankiewicz, Will Feuer and MacKenzie Sigalos contributed to this story.']"

', 'Lautenschleger is one of several Amazon sellers who are up in arms over a recent policy change meant to help the company conserve space in its warehouses as it faces a pandemic-fueled surge in e-commerce demand alongside the peak holiday shopping season. ', 'In August, Amazon put in place stricter quantity limits on shipments from third-party sellers that use its fulfillment service to package and ship orders, known as Fulfillment by Amazon, or FBA. The limits apply to all product categories and differ on an item-by-item basis.', 'For Lautenschleger, it means he can only send in roughly 230 units per shipment of his fast-selling “Anchorman: The Game,” whereas he would’ve sent in thousands of units of a hot-selling item in years past.', 'With the Anchorman game out of stock, Lautenschleger said all he can do is send in more inventory and wait for it to arrive at FBA warehouses. In the meantime, he said he’s losing out on potential sales, which could have lasting consequences for his business, like determining how many new employees he can afford to hire in the new year.', '“You have to sell the products to be able to send them in, but you have to have them in in order to sell them,” Lautenschleger said in an interview with CNBC. “So that’s the Catch-22 that we find ourselves in now.”', 'When Amazon announced the policy in August, it said the quantity limits would help ensure all sellers using FBA have space to store their products. The initiative was also meant to prevent the kinds of supply chain bottlenecks and delivery delays Amazon experienced during the early months of the pandemic. ', 'Few periods are as important for Amazon to live up to its two-day delivery promise and reputation as the “Everything Store” than the holiday shopping season. This year is forecast to be busier than ever, with U.S. shoppers expected to spend $189 billion online in November and December, a 33% increase year over year, according to Adobe Analytics. ', 'It’s not just Amazon that is feeling the pressure this holiday season. Many retailers, and also the National Retail Federation, have warned consumers to get their holiday shopping done early to avoid potential shipping chaos and to make sure they receive their gifts on time. Big-box retailers like Walmart and Target have pointed shoppers to curbside pickup in order to fulfill orders quickly, while on-demand delivery companies such as Postmates, Instacart and DoorDash have partnered up with companies like Sephora, Macy’s and Estee Lauder’s Le Labo to get items to people’s homes.', 'There are also fears of a significant capacity shortfall among major shipping carriers FedEx, the U.S. Postal Service and UPS, which reportedly told its drivers on Cyber Monday to stop picking up packages from some of the largest U.S. retailers after they exceeded their allocated volumes.', 'Amazon has ramped up capacity since March, growing its warehouse footprint across the country at an unprecedented speed. The company expects to increase its network square footage, which includes fulfillment center space, along with sort centers and delivery stations, by 50% this year, up from 15% growth in 2019.', 'Even with the added capacity, Amazon still had to take steps to conserve space in its U.S. warehouses, by limiting storage of third-party sellers’ products and its own goods.', '“I don’t think they’ve been quite able to get a grasp of the forecast,” said Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder of consulting firm Logistics Trends & Insights. “When they said back in the third quarter that they were going to have 50% more space, that may have been adequate at the beginning of this year, but because of Covid, it’s no longer adequate.”', 'Sellers say they understand why Amazon needed to limit the size of shipments into its warehouses, but they feel the policy puts them in a bind during a holiday that’s already proven challenging due to the pandemic. ', 'The inventory-related struggles come as Amazon has highlighted success of small businesses on its platform on this year’s pandemic-delayed Prime Day as well as on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.', 'While the inventory restrictions aren’t limited to third-party sellers — Amazon has previously said it’s metering storage of its own products, too, in its warehouses — merchants said they felt like they had little say in how the limits are determined.', 'Several sellers who spoke to CNBC said they expect to finish out the year with sales up significantly from 2019, but that revenue could be better if not for the inventory restrictions.', 'Steven Pope, who sells wine glasses on Amazon, expressed frustration over how the company determined the quantity limits. Pope and other sellers who spoke to CNBC said Amazon calculates how many units they can send in by looking at the last 90 days of sales for a particular product. For new products, it’s even more strict, since there’s a “hard cap” of 200 units, Pope said.', 'Merchants who sell holiday products told CNBC that they felt the company wasn’t taking seasonality into account when determining the quantity limits.', 'One Amazon seller, who asked to remain anonymous, told CNBC they offer a popular Christmas bag on Amazon and are able to send in 50 units per shipment. However, they sell about 40 units per day and only have 150 units left in stock. The seller said they’ll likely need to restock soon, but they’re concerned they won’t be able to ship it in time for the rest of the holiday shopping rush.', 'An Amazon spokesperson said the company does factor in seasonality, along with a seller’s historical sales, forecast demand and the capacity available in its fulfillment centers, when setting quantity limits. The Amazon spokesperson didn’t answer specific questions around how far the company looks back when it assesses historical sales.', 'For new products, the company said it initially limits shipments to 200 units until sellers a build product sales history, but that it periodically evaluates and updates the minimum quantity so that a large majority of new products have enough units to establish a product sales history.', 'In August, Amazon told merchants if they sell all of their stock they could send in more inventory at any time. But sellers say it’s not that easy, since there are delays when they ship products to Amazon’s warehouses.', 'Jerry Kavesh, an Amazon merchant who sells cowboy boots, hats, belts and other items, said he’s been “sending in product like crazy,” but it has taken anywhere from 10 days to two weeks for it to enter FBA warehouses. Before, it would take only two to four days.', '“We’re out of stock in our warehouse and I know I have 30 units at Amazon, but they’re being processed,” Kavesh said in a recent interview. “It’s been that way for five days. It’s killing us.”', 'The Amazon spokesperson said it checks in seller inventory, on average, within three to five days of its arrival at its warehouses. The company added that some sellers may experience longer inbound times based on the facility they’re shipping to.', 'Pope said one of the top wine glasses sold by his business, Momstir, is now very close to stocking out, at a time when he typically sees a 400% spike in sales between Black Friday and Christmas. It means he’ll likely lose out on a significant chunk of holiday sales this year.', '“I was projecting I was going to probably do half a million just in December and now, realistically, I’m going to tap out at $310,000,” Pope said. “It’s depressing.”', 'Once an inventory limit is determined for a product, sellers can’t appeal to Amazon to ask that their limit be increased. A notice sent to sellers and viewed by CNBC says the company isn’t “accepting requests for higher quantity limits” and notes that “shipping a quantity above your limit may result in account suspension.”', 'Sellers are also concerned that if they run out of stock, their listing may be penalized in Amazon’s search ranking algorithms. Amazon will push listings down further in search results if it detects they are running low on inventory or are out of stock, sellers claim. An issue in the early months of the pandemic, some sellers previously raised prices on their products or cut back on advertising to avoid the same painful fate.', 'The amount of inventory sellers can send in this year is a far cry from what they’d usually have in stock. Lautenschleger, who helps run the novelty game business, said he’d typically send in 5,000 units in late summer, monitor sales in September and October, then send in another batch depending on feedback.', 'With FBA warehouses continuing to limit inventory shipments, some sellers have chosen to fulfill orders themselves or, like Lautenschleger’s businesses, have turned to third-party logistics providers to get products out the door in time for the holidays. Lautenschleger added that he considers his business to be “one of the lucky ones,” since it also sells products at Target and on its own website.', '“My job is to come up with new games,” Lautenschleger said. “I’m trying to grow our company in so many other ways, that for me to suddenly have to take on a daily inventory watch job, that was not in the cards of an already busy year.”']"

Next month, the warship will be commissioned the USS Little Rock before deploying to Florida.', 'In addition to automation that has cut crew size in half versus more traditional ships of this size, interchangeable “mission packages,” and a top speed of 40 knots, the close-to-shore warship will tout something else: the ability to vertically launch Hellfire missiles (also made by Lockheed) to target threats on land, sea and in the air.', 'It’s one of the ways Lockheed is looking to make the controversial ship more lethal. It’s a strategy meant to not only silence critics and snag more orders, but better position the top defense contractor for one of the biggest, most-anticipated new Navy contracts.', '“This is a warship,” says Michele Evans, Lockheed’s vice president and general manager of integrated warfare systems and sensors, a multibillion dollar Naval systems portfolio that includes LCS and the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system.', '“It really looks to bring vertical launching systems, take advantage of a lot of what we develop with Aegis, and eventually, we could even look at having a laser-based system on this.', '“So, we see the growth potential and I think there’s a desire as the Navy looks toward a future frigate.”', 'That future frigate is the Navy’s “future guided missile frigate” or FFG(X), a competition for a next-generation small combatant ship to be based off of an existing small surface combatant (like for example, LCS).', 'Last week the Navy released a design request for proposal that’s expected to be awarded next year, the last step before selected contractors build their concepts. Officials met with industry on Friday to review the hundreds of pages of guidelines.', 'The final contract is set to be awarded in 2020, with the program likely to be worth about $15 billion, according to Roman Schweizer, a defense analyst at Cowen. It’s expected to span at least 20 ships.', 'For the Littoral Combat Ship, Lockheed, an LCS co-prime, partners with shipbuilder Fincantieri Marinette Marine and ship designer Gibbs & Cox for its Freedom-class variant.', 'Lockheed says it will “absolutely” bid for the frigate, but with the competition still in early stages and many details unknown, it says potential partners are yet-to-be-determined.', 'It already has company. LCS co-prime Austal has also said it will compete. An Australian company, Austal has a shipyard in Alabama where it currently makes the Independence-class Littoral Combat Ship.

The Littoral Combat Ship has seen no shortage of critics, including Senate Armed Services Committee chair John McCain, who has repeatedly slammed it as an example of defense-related waste and inefficiency.', '“Initial cost overruns more than doubled the cost of each LCS, development costs for the ships and their modules now exceed $6 billion dollars, and they keep rising,” the senator said at a hearing in June. “Meanwhile, key warfighting capabilities of the LCS including key mine counter measures and antisubmarine warfare have fallen years, I repeat years, behind schedule and remain unproven.”', 'Responsibility can go around for those challenges, to the contractors but also the Navy itself, which changed criteria even as the earliest ships were being built.', 'For its part, Lockheed Martin says those growing pains are behind it, as production has ramped to full-rate. It now takes about three years from start of fabrication to delivery, explains Joe DePietro, Lockheed’s vice president of small combatants and ship systems, compared to “in excess” of five years for the very first Lockheed LCS called USS Freedom.', 'Also worth noting, while price varies per contract and vessel, a LCS still only costs about $500 million — double the initial target price set in the early 2000s — but still a fraction of the billions spent on a Navy destroyer or cruiser.']"

Starship prototypes stand at about 160 feet tall, or around the size of a 16-story building, and are built of stainless steel — representing the early version of the rocket that Musk unveiled in 2019. ', 'The rocket lifts off on top of a Super Heavy booster, which makes up the bottom half of the rocket and stands about 230 feet tall. Together, Starship and Super Heavy are nearly 400 feet tall when stacked for launch.', 'The company rolled out Super Heavy Booster 4 on Tuesday.', 'SpaceX has conducted multiple short test flights of Starship prototypes over the past year, but reaching orbit represents the next step in testing the rocket. The company in May revealed its plan for the first orbital flight, which would launch from the company’s facility in Texas and aim to splash down off the coast of Hawaii.', 'The company has been working rapidly to ready Starship and the Super Heavy booster for the orbital flight test, although a local environmental review by the Federal Aviation Administration needs to be completed before the launch happens.', 'Musk outlined four “significant items” that SpaceX aims to complete over the next two weeks in preparing Starship 20 for launch.', 'He said SpaceX needs to add the “final heat shield tiles” to the ship, add “thermal protection” to the Raptor rocket engines in Booster 4, complete work on “ground propellant storage tanks” and add a quick disconnect arm to the top of the recently built launch tower. The quick disconnect arm connects power and fuel lines to the rocket before launch.', 'While SpaceX’s fleet of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets are partially reusable, Musk’s goal is to make Starship fully reusable — a rocket that is more akin to a commercial airplane, with short turnaround times between flights such that the only major cost is fuel.', 'One important piece of making Starship fully reusable is improving its durability to survive the intense process of reentering the Earth’s atmosphere. Small hexagonal heat shield tiles are SpaceX’s answer to that problem, with the previously shiny Starship 20 rocket now covered in thousands of the tiles.', 'Musk noted that work on the tiles is about “98% done” for Starship 20, as “the remaining tiles are unique shapes requiring machining.”', 'NASA has been paying close attention to Starship’s development, especially as the U.S. space agency earlier this year awarded SpaceX a controversial $2.9 billion contract to deliver astronauts to the surface of the moon using the rockets.', 'Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA’s top official for science missions, told CNBC that he continues to watch progress on Starship.', '“Yes, I have been following this all along and am excited for @SpaceX achieving this milestone! Can’t wait to see it fly!” Zurbuchen wrote in a tweet.', 'Musk replied to Zurbuchen in another tweet, touting the projected capabilities of Starship.', '“Due to its size & ability to return science instruments even from deep space, Starship will enable a whole new class of science missions,” Musk wrote.']"
72,The race to roll out ‘super-sized’ wind turbines is on,2022-04-13T05:24:20+0000,"['In the not too distant future, waters 15 miles off Martha’s Vineyard will be home to a potentially crucial part of America’s energy future: the 800-megawatt Vineyard Wind 1, a project that’s been described as “the nation’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm.”', 'Construction of Vineyard Wind 1 started last year, and the facility will use 13 MW versions of GE Renewable Energy’s Haliade-X turbines. With a height of up to 260 meters (853 feet), a rotor diameter of 220 meters and 107-meter blades, the Haliade-X is part of a new generation of turbines set to be installed in the years ahead.', 'In addition to GE, other companies are getting in on the big turbine act. In Aug. 2021, China’s MingYang Smart Energy released details of a 264-meter tall design that will use 118-meter blades.', 'Elsewhere, Danish firm Vestas is working on a 15-megawatt turbine that will have a rotor diameter of 236 meters and 115.5-meter blades while Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy is developing a turbine that incorporates 108-meter blades and a rotor diameter of 222 meters.', 'The reasons for these increases in size are clear. When it comes to height, the U.S. Department of Energy says the towers of turbines “are becoming taller to capture more energy, since winds generally increase as altitudes increase.”', 'A bigger rotor diameter isn’t just for show either, with the DOE noting that they “allow wind turbines to sweep more area, capture more wind, and produce more electricity.”', 'It’s much the same with blades. The DOE says longer blades can “capture more of the available wind than shorter blades—even in areas with relatively less wind.”', 'Having huge turbines arrive on the market is all well and good, but their sheer scale may pose a number of mid-to-long term challenges for the sector, creating pinch points that could cause headaches.', 'Take installations. In February, research from Rystad Energy honed in on some of the possible issues related to the ships used to install offshore wind turbines out at sea.', 'Not counting China, it said wind turbines had seen what it called “a growth spurt in recent years, rising from an average of 3 megawatts (MW) in 2010 to 6.5 MW today.”', 'This shift, it explained, was likely to be sustained. “Turbines larger than 8 MW accounted for just 3% of global installations between 2010 and 2021, but that percentage is forecast to surge to 53% by 2030.”', 'The above data relates to offshore wind turbines only. According to the energy research and business intelligence firm, demand for vessels able to install larger offshore turbines is set to outstrip supply by the year 2024.', 'Operators, it said, “will have to invest in new vessels or upgrade existing ones to install the super-sized turbines that are expected to become the norm by the end of the decade, or the pace of offshore wind installations could slow down.”', '“When turbines were smaller, installation could be handled by the first-generation fleet of offshore wind vessels or converted jackups from the oil and gas industry,” Martin Lysne, senior analyst for rigs and vessels at Rystad Energy, said in a statement at the time.', 'With operators continuing to favor bigger turbines, Lysne said a “new generation of purpose-built vessels” would be needed to satisfy demand.', 'These specialized vessels don’t come cheap. U.S. firm Dominion Energy, for example, is heading up a consortium building the 472-foot Charybdis, which will cost around $500 million and be able to install current turbines and next-generation ones of 12 MW or greater. More vessels like the Charybdis will be needed in the future as turbines grow.', '“Out of the current fleet of purpose-built vessels, only a handful of units can install 10 MW+ turbines, and none are currently able to install 14 MW+ turbines,” according to Rystad Energy’s analysis. “This will change towards 2025 as newbuilds start to be delivered and existing vessels get crane upgrades.” ', 'The ships that transport and install turbines will be important in the years ahead, but the ports where they dock are another area where investment and upgrades will likely be needed to cater to wind energy’s growth.', 'In a comment sent to CNBC via email, Rystad Energy’s Lysne described port infrastructure as being “very important” from a vessel perspective.', 'Going forward, it would appear that a lot of money will be needed. Last May, a report from industry body WindEurope said Europe’s ports would have to invest 6.5 billion euros (around $7.07 billion) by 2030 in order “to support the expansion of offshore wind.”', 'The report addressed the new reality of bigger turbines and the effect this could have in relation to ports and infrastructure. “Upgraded or entirely new facilities are needed to host larger turbines and a larger market,” it said.', 'Ports, WindEurope said, would also need to “expand their land, reinforce quays, enhance their deep-sea harbours and carry out other civil works.”', 'More recently, a report from the Global Wind Energy Council also reinforced the importance of ports.', '“As offshore wind projects expand and commercial-scale floating wind projects proliferate, port upgrades will be critical for the future success of the industry,” it said.', 'The Brussels-based organization said turbine sizes had “increased dramatically” over the past decade, noting that 15 MW turbines were available on the market.', '“Experts now predict turbines with a 17 MW rating will be commonplace by 2035,” it said, before adding that projects centered around floating offshore wind were being developed “at huge volumes.”', 'These “floating projects” needed “significant quayside storage and assembly, necessitating more spacious facilities, on-land connective transport links within port areas and deeper-water ports.”', '“Several governments have identified port upgrades as vital to progressing offshore wind, from Taiwan to New York State.”', 'In relation to ports, Rystad Energy’s Lysne told CNBC that the U.S. — whose current offshore wind market is small — would “require more work as they do not have the same infrastructure in place as Europe.”', 'Change on that front does appear to be forthcoming. At the beginning of March, BP and Equinor — two businesses better known as oil and gas producers — signed an agreement to convert the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal into an offshore wind port.', 'In an announcement, Equinor said the port would become “a cutting-edge staging facility for Equinor and bp’s Empire Wind and Beacon Wind projects.” The site, it claimed, would be “a go-to destination for future offshore wind projects in the region.” Investment in infrastructure upgrades is expected to come in at $200 to $250 million.', 'All of the above feeds into the importance of infrastructure and logistics. Shashi Barla, who is global head of wind supply chain and technology at Wood Mackenzie, told CNBC that while companies had the technological capabilities, logistical challenges were proving to be “very difficult.”', '“It’s not that it is something new … we have been talking about logistics challenges since day one of the industry,” Barla said. “It’s that ... we are kind of now, today, approaching the tipping point.”', 'Around the world, major economies are announcing plans to ramp up wind energy capacity in a bid to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.', 'While these goals are ambitious, it’s clear they face a number of hurdles. Notwithstanding the issues related to turbine size, it will require a gargantuan effort to bring all these installations online. There’s work to be done.   ', '“Increasingly, a lack of facilitating infrastructure is seen as a major limiting factor in the wind industry’s growth,” the GWEC’s report noted.', '“In many countries,” it added, “lack of infrastructure, such as grid and transmission networks, logistics highways and ports, is curtailing the expansion of wind power and stifling the very innovation needed to transform the energy system.”', 'Alongside these issues, wind turbines’ interaction with wildlife is likely to be another area of major debate and discussion going forward.', 'Only last week, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that a firm called ESI Energy Inc had “pled guilty to three counts of violating the MBTA,” or Migratory Bird Treaty Act.', 'As the 21st century progresses, wind energy is set for a massive expansion, but the road ahead looks far from smooth.

No matter how you look at it – even with 3D printing, and dropping the cost, and [increasing the] automation of a launch vehicle – making it reusable has got to be part of that future,” Ellis added.', 'Terran R is the first of several new initiatives that Ellis expects Relativity to unveil in the year ahead, with the company having raised more than $680 million since its founding five years ago. Just like Terran 1, Relativity will build Terran R with more than 90% of the parts through additive manufacturing – utilizing the world’s largest 3D printers as what Ellis calls “the factory of the future.”', 'Relativity, valued at $2.3 billion, ranks as one of the most valuable private space companies in the world.

That puts Terran 1 in the middle of the U.S. launch market, in between Rocket Lab’s Electron and SpaceX’s Falcon 9 in both price and capability.', 'Ellis said Terran R will be capable of lifting nearly 20 times as much payload as Terran 1, with Relativity targeting a rocket capable of launching more than 20,000 kilograms to low Earth orbit. That would be near the 22,800 kilograms that SpaceX says its Falcon 9 rockets can launch.', 'While Ellis declined to disclose what price per launch Relativity expects for Terran R, he said that Relativity plans to be competitive with other offerings. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches with a $62 million price tag, with Musk’s company saying each rocket costs about $28 million to launch.', '“We really were asked by the market to create [Terran R] and we’re currently talking with customers,” Ellis said.', 'Relativity has a pipeline worth several billion dollars of contracts “in active dialogue” for both its Terran 1 and Terran R rockets, Ellis said, with customer interest split evenly between the two vehicles. He noted that the Terran 1 contracts that Relativity has announced to date have binding launch service agreements, so customers are paying on deposits for the rockets.', '“There are tons of customers, all getting funding and developing big plans, and that’s really driving the need for more launch capacity globally,” Ellis said.', 'Not only does Relativity’s CEO expect to be competitive in the marketplace, but he also believes there will be more spacecraft trying to launch than there are rides to orbit.', '“There’s actually going to be a launch shortage, if you look at how many people are trying to launch payloads to space,” Ellis said. “Almost every model we’ve looked at, there need to be more launch vehicles to deploy even a fraction of the plans that people are talking about.”', 'Ellis also touted Terran R’s reusability as further enhancing Relativity’s competitiveness.', '“I just don’t see a future where a fully reusable rocket doesn’t exist and doesn’t need to exist,” Ellis said.', 'He highlighted SpaceX’s work on reusability as informing Relativity’s approach to Terran R, which he expects will be “fully reusable.” SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets are partially reusable, in that the company lands the first stage (also known as the booster) and often recovers the rocket’s nosecone. But SpaceX does not recover Falcon 9′s second stages – a feat Relativity aims to pull off by 3D printing designs which “wouldn’t be possible with traditional manufacturing,” Ellis said.', '“We will be able to print far more exotic and traditionally difficult-to-manufacture materials that make both first- and second-stage reusability much better,” Ellis said.', 'Relativity’s focus on 3D printing means the company doesn’t have to change or add new equipment to its production line.', '“The printers, straight up with software changes, will build Terran R,” Ellis said.', '“It’s a completely different technology stack for aerospace,” Ellis added. “Every aerospace factory you walk into today is still building products with giant fixed tooling and a very complex supply chain and it takes many years to develop a new product.

Growing frustrated, he got in touch with a Post Office supervisor, who told him the packages were accidentally left behind on a semi truck in the Detroit facility. Shortly after, the items were shipped out. ', 'Williams attributes the mishap to ongoing delays created by the pandemic, which have hampered the USPS and other carriers. “Every once in a while something gets missed, but that’s the first time that happened to me to that degree,” he added. ', 'The incident is an example of what could become a recurring headache for small and big online businesses if problems with the U.S. Postal Service persist. ', 'The Postal Service faces a tough road ahead. Its financial woes were exacerbated by the pandemic, and critical funding is tied up in the latest coronavirus relief package, which President Donald Trump has rejected as part of his fight against mail-in voting. The USPS also faces operational challenges after recently installed Postmaster General Louis DeJoy limited overtime and prohibited workers from making late delivery trips. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that DeJoy would pause the roll out of those initiatives until after the November presidential election.', 'The changes instituted by DeJoy, in addition to the coronavirus pandemic, have coincided with reports of widespread mail delays like those experienced by Williams. Still, the Postal Service is largely operating without delays for many Americans nationwide.', 'In June, USPS delivered 93.7% of first-class mail packages on time, according to ShipMatrix, a software provider that analyzes shipping data. That’s in line with or better than UPS or FedEx, which reported on-time delivery rates of 94% and 91.5%, respectively, during the same period. However, it’s still down from May, when the USPS delivered 94.9% of packages on time.', '“Even at 93.7%, that 6.3% can be hundreds of thousands of packages,” said Satish Jindel, founder of ShipMatrix. “It’s not a great number, but they’re moving tens of millions of packages per day, and you’re not going to hear about the good cases.”', 'The USPS is relied upon not only by small businesses who sell goods via their own websites, but also sprawling online marketplaces operated by Amazon, EBay, Etsy, as well as major retailers like Walmart and Target. Growth in package shipping from online retailers like Amazon has consistently been a bright spot in the Post Office’s financial results, amid declines in shipments of letters and magazines.', 'Amazon has built up a vast logistics and fulfillment operation across the country, but it still relies on the Postal Service to handle some last-mile deliveries when it’s not using its own contractors. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on what percentage of its packages are delivered by USPS, but some analysts estimate the Postal Service delivers 40% of Amazon’s orders. ', 'UPS, DHL and FedEx also rely on the Postal Service to handle a portion of their last-mile deliveries via the same Parcel Select service used by Amazon. The service allows carriers and companies like Amazon to handle the long distance portion of the delivery process, then drop packages off at local Post Offices, where employees handle last-mile deliveries within a certain radius. ', '“In cases where it’s not actually profitable for Amazon, UPS, FedEx or DHL to make the delivery, they actually rely on USPS,” said Mario Paganini, head of marketing at Shippo, which provides software to connect businesses with shipping services. “It’s much more cost effective to bring a large volume of halfway or all the way across the country and then have the USPS do the last-mile delivery.”', 'For small business owners, the USPS is often the most affordable and reliable shipping option available. Roughly 89% of the small- and medium-sized businesses that use Shippo select the USPS as their primary carrier, Paganini said. Shippo doesn’t disclose how many SMBs use its services, but they make up the majority of the services’ 50,000-plus active customers.', '″[The USPS] is a pretty key enabler of small business,” Paganini said. “This is something that a lot of people overlook and take for granted.”', 'John Von Colln, founder of on-demand poster printing company Shortrunposters.com, said the Postal Service typically charges about $5 per order for first-class mail, while UPS’s shipping rates can cost more than double that price. ', 'Von Colln said it’s important that his company offer affordable shipping costs for cheap, lightweight items like posters to keep customers happy. “People don’t want to pay more for shipping than the product itself,” Von Colln added. ', 'Delivery delays aren’t the only concern weighing on business owners’ minds. They also worry about the possibility that the Postal Service will be pressured to raise shipping prices as a way to shore up its finances.', 'President Trump has repeatedly called for the Postal Service to quadruple its package delivery services, claiming the Postal Service has charged online retailers too little to deliver packages. Trump has long held, without evidence, that Amazon is being subsidized by the Postal Service, once saying that Amazon uses the USPS as its “delivery boy.”', 'The Postal Service on Friday announced it would raise the price of commercial shipments during the peak holiday shopping period, but the rate increase is temporary, ending Dec. 27. UPS and FedEx have since announced similar price hikes. ', 'John Webber, founder of Carved, which designs and manufactures wooden smartphone cases, said that if the USPS raises prices, it would not only hurt his business’ bottom line, but it would most likely mean he’d pass the cost onto consumers. He estimates that the Postal Service manages more than 90% of his company’s domestic package volume. ', 'The Postal Service’s affordable prices have become even more critical during the pandemic and the broader economic downturn, which has forced many businesses to look for ways to cut costs.', 'What’s more, if the USPS aggressively hiked its shipping prices like Trump has suggested, some businesses might turn to competing carriers like UPS and FedEx, causing it to lose market share.', 'Calls to keep Postal Service prices affordable have garnered support from a growing number of e-commerce companies and retailers. The Package Coalition, a lobbying group backed by Amazon and eBay, among others, has urged lawmakers to keep the service “affordable and reliable.”', 'In May, the retail coalition launched a series of television ads in a number of states opposing efforts to impose rate hikes on the Postal Service. The group also continues to lobby the Senate to provide emergency relief for the Post Service, fearing it will run out of cash in the “not too distant future,” said John McHugh, chairman of the Package Coalition.', '“This is not a ‘maybe it’ll happen,’ it’s ‘when will [it] happen,’” McHugh said. “We’ve really been going full boar in attempting to help lawmakers and their key staff.” ', 'Etsy and EBay have advocated directly for the need for additional USPS funding on behalf of the business owners that make up their marketplaces.

EBay sellers also meet with lawmakers in Washington, D.C. each year to discuss issues impacting their business. Williams, who is a part of eBay’s small business ambassador network, attended last year’s meeting and said the Postal Service was one of several issues discussed.', '“We talked to them about insuring that the USPS remains a public service and ensuring that it can provide service to rural areas at affordable rates,” Williams said, adding that eBay remains actively engaged in these issues with lawmakers.']"

When I visited tech companies, I began to look at what software developers had on their desks. One developer I met at Pinterest had a keyboard called a DataHand that let him type five keys with each of his fingers. It blew my mind.', 'That’s when I fell into the wonderful world of mechanical keyboards. They’re different from the common rubber-dome keyboards that are often embedded in laptops.', 'You can see the difference in this picture, which shows what lurks under each key in a traditional rubber-dome keyboard (left) and a mechanical keyboard (right).', 'On mechanical keyboards, each plastic keycap covers a physical switch that goes up and down. It can be triggered not just when you push the key all the way down, but even part of the way down. As a result, you can type faster and more comfortably on these keyboards.', 'It didn’t take me long to fall down the rabbit hole.', 'I started following discussions about keyboards on Reddit. The MechanicalKeyboards community, with 490,000 subscribers today, has a new post to read every few minutes. I learned about various keyboard models and individual components on specialized websites like Deskthority and Geekhack, and then I watched reviews on YouTube. I kept an eye out for releases of interesting products on Drop, a commerce site with a dedicated keyboards section.', 'After months of research, I wound up buying keyboards from Apple, Corsair, Matias and a small Taiwanese company called KBParadise. But none of them was just right.', 'So I decided to take the next logical step and assemble my own keyboard.', 'I knew I wanted a wood case. And I knew what types of switches I wanted — clones of tactile Alps switches that emit a delightful clop-clip sound, just like the ones that appeared on Apple’s high-quality keyboards from the 1980s and ’90s.', 'From there, I was able to find keycaps that fit the Alps-style switches and MacOS, and I chose a compatible printed circuit board and plate to sit below the switches. There are companies that make all sorts of custom USB cables, and I picked up one of those, too. I also bought some lube to make the switches move up and down more smoothly.', 'My girlfriend gave me a soldering iron, and I ordered solder. In all, I’ve spent more than $750 on the keyboard parts and associated equipment for putting everything together.', 'I’m waiting for the custom wooden case to arrive in the mail. Meanwhile, I’ve started accumulating parts for a new Windows keyboard.', 'The soldering iron also came in handy recently when the A key on my main work keyboard, a Matias with “silent” switches (they’re not perfectly silent, as my colleagues can attest) stopped working. I called the manufacturer, and a very nice customer-service representative mailed me instructions for replacing the switch at home, along with five new switches.', 'To gain the necessary soldering experience, I ripped apart an old alarm clock and practiced removing and re-soldering some of the connections on the circuit board inside it.

It felt great to personally fix something I not only relied on, but loved.', 'Now, there’s an emerging category of keyboards that let users swap out different types of switches without soldering anytime. The freedom to easily give my keyboard a different feel intrigues me.

He shared a blog post with photos of his prototypes on the message board Hacker News, which got people’s attention. In 2015 he and Dekker started a Kickstarter campaign, and they raised $652,000, five times more than what they had sought, and sold 2,125 keyboards. Shipments began in 2017.', 'The Model 1 is flatter and more portable than the Kinesis Advantage, and about $20 cheaper, at $329.

He’s not sure if they’re for business use or for personal enjoyment. “It’s nice because I get to do something that’s my hobby,” he said.', 'I asked Vincent why there seems to be a movement building around keyboards, and he talked about how the keyboard is the tool he uses to create things, and how he spends so much of his life with it.', '“I think especially as the default options for keyboards have gotten worse and worse and worse, it’s made it easier and easier to notice that you want something better and to start to think about it,” he said.

He said it was small in comparison with events he’d attended in Japan and Taiwan. But to me it was almost sensory overload — booth after booth of magnificent keyboards. Wichary was there, too, and he shared facts about various models on display.', 'There was, for instance, a Northgate OmniKey Ultra from the late 1980s, and Wichary pointed out that it had a “comma period lock” key. It was conceived to prevent people from accidentally sending less-than or equal-to signs when they hit the comma and period keys, regardless of whether the shift key is being held down. On typewriters from earlier years, even if you weren’t holding down the shift key, a comma or a period resulted every time you hit their corresponding keys, making it easier to add those punctuation marks while writing uppercase letters.

Tankers will visit the ship once a week to offload its LNG for export.', 'The $14bn Prelude project, led by Royal Dutch Shell, is the latest in a surge of new LNG capacity which promises to reshape the oil and gas industry — and with it, the energy markets they serve. Chevron’s Wheatstone LNG development in Australia is due to start producing this month, on the heels of its nearby Gorgon project last year, after a combined $88bn of investment. ExxonMobil, BP, Total and Eni have also made big commitments.', ' Supplies of LNG are on course to increase by 50 per cent between 2014 and 2021. That implies the opening of a new LNG “train” — the facilities that condense gas into liquid form to allow it to be transported long distances by ship — every two to three months. Spencer Dale, chief economist at BP, calls that a “quite astonishing” rate of growth. ', 'The investments are part of a wider dash for gas among the biggest energy companies, as the industry bets that the clean characteristics of gas compared with oil and coal will allow it to keep growing as other fossil fuels decline.', 'Gas emits half as much carbon dioxide as coal when burnt to generate electricity, and at least 75 per cent less nitrogen oxide and other health-harming particles. This makes gas a potential ally in the fights against climate change and air pollution, while providing a hedge for industry against the threat of electric vehicles eroding demand for oil.', 'Companies that once treated gas as the poor relation to “black gold” are now gambling that the colourless commodity can help secure their future in a decarbonising world. Of the 16 new BP projects due on stream between this year and 2021, 12 involve gas rather than oil. Similar shifts are under way across the industry. Gas outweighs oil by a factor of two-to-one among pre-development resources awaiting investment decisions, according to Wood Mackenzie, the energy consultancy.', '“In the past, when you struck gas rather than oil in this industry you were disappointed, but now we go looking for it,” says Claudio Descalzi, chief executive of Eni, the Italian group due to bring the huge Zohr gasfield off the coast of Egypt on stream by the end of this year.', 'The gamble on gas rests in large part on the sector’s ability to squeeze coal out of the global energy system and compete with the rise of wind and solar power.', '“Renewables will dominate in the long run but during the transition, and maybe even at the end of it, there will need to be a stable source of electricity that can step in when wind and solar are not available,” says Maarten Wetselaar, head of Shell’s gas business. “I’m absolutely convinced that gas will provide that role.”', 'Nowhere is more important to the prospects of gas than Asia. China and India alone are expected to account for half of the 30 per cent increase in global energy demand forecast by BP between now and 2035. Coal still accounts for about 60 per cent of electricity generation in China and India, but rising concern about smog — as well as both countries’ commitments under the Paris climate accord — is creating an opening for gas. China aims to increase the share of gas in its total energy consumption from 6 per cent to 15 per cent by 2030. There are signs of growth: Chinese LNG imports increased 38 per cent in the first half of this year, compared with the same period in 2016.', '“We’ll not squeeze out coal overnight, but air pollution is becoming a political problem in China,” says Mr Wetselaar. “The priority has been jobs and cheap electricity but, when you cannot go outside for 30 days because of smog, environmental factors count for more.”', 'The need for regulatory help in driving out coal explains why all the big oil groups support the taxation of carbon emissions — a measure, so far only sporadically adopted around the world, which makes coal more expensive relative to gas. But producers are not relying solely on political intervention to stimulate demand. They are also finding ways to deliver gas more economically. Floating storage and regasification units, or FSRUs — ships which can receive LNG and convert it back into gas — have sprung up on coastlines around the world as a low-cost alternative to building permanent onshore terminals.', 'The number of countries importing LNG has almost doubled in the past decade to 35, in large part because FSRUs have made it affordable in places such as Pakistan, Jordan and Colombia. “It used to take four years and $500m to build an LNG-receiving terminal. Now you can have an FSRU floating off your country 18 months after taking the decision,” says Mr Wetselaar.', 'France’s Total is leading a consortium building an FSRU and associated gas pipelines in Ivory Coast, an example of producers investing in downstream infrastructure to open new markets.', 'As well as seeking a bigger role in electricity generation, gas producers also see growth in the industrial, chemicals and transport sectors. In ships, for example, LNG can be used as a cleaner alternative to heavy fuel oil as the maritime industry faces regulatory pressure to reduce emissions. Carnival, the cruise line operator, has ordered seven LNG-powered ships and Shell is investing in gas infrastructure at ports including Rotterdam and Singapore to encourage cargo carriers to follow suit.', '“Heavy transport by ships, trucks and buses can’t be electrified and the lowest carbon alternative is for them to use LNG,” says Mr Wetselaar.', 'Yet for all the optimism, projects such as Prelude and Wheatstone are fraught with commercial risk. The arrival of large-scale Australian LNG has coincided with the surge of US shale gas. The US is on course to become a net exporter of gas this year for the first time since 1957, as numerous LNG terminals are brought online. By 2022, the US is likely to be vying with Australia and Qatar to be the biggest exporter of LNG, according to the International Energy Agency.', 'This surge of new capacity is calling into question the economic assumptions underpinning the Australian LNG projects and others such as ExxonMobil’s in Papua New Guinea, BP’s in Indonesia and Total’s in Russia. Gas prices in Europe and Asia — the biggest LNG markets — have fallen by over 40 per cent in the past five years, reducing returns on investment below the level anticipated when the projects were approved.', '“An oversupplied LNG market is helping alter the dynamics of the gas market by shifting the balance of power from producers to customers,” says Dan Smith, an analyst at Oxford Economics. “LNG buyers are able to be more demanding and have been pushing for shorter and more flexible contracts.”', 'A market once dominated by long-term contracts between a small number of suppliers, and an equally exclusive club of buyers such as Japan and South Korea, has been blown open by the influx of US gas. A decade ago, more than 95 per cent of LNG contracts were for 10 years or more. Today, that figure is down to about 60 per cent.', '“Up until now, LNG has been a technology with high barriers to entry,” says Noel Tomnay, head of global gas at Wood Mackenzie. “The US is democratising the market and now any Tom, Dick or Harry can access LNG.”', 'Mr Wetselaar insists that moderate prices and proliferating sources of flexible supply and demand are good for customers and producers alike. “Gas needs to be affordable. To grow profitability of this business we need volume growth not margin growth, because margin growth means higher prices which will drive demand away.”  Despite the positive signs in China, low prices have so far failed to stimulate a boom in global gas demand. Consumption growth has slowed from an average of 3 per cent a year in the first decade of this century to about 1.4 per cent annually since 2010.', '“This slowdown has put some producers in a tight corner,” the IEA said in its latest annual outlook. “While gas is set to perform much better than other fossil fuels over the coming decades, some of the pillars on which a bright future for gas have been constructed look a little less solid than they have in the past.”', 'Demand for gas has been held back by two main factors. One is rapid growth in renewable power. In Europe, this has led to the mothballing of some gas-fired power stations as rising wind and solar generation pushes down wholesale electricity prices. The other is that coal remains cheaper to burn than gas in many parts of the world.  Gas producers portray their product as a “bridging fuel” between the eras of hydrocarbons and renewables. The risk for the industry is that advances in battery technology — which allows surplus wind and solar power to be stored for future use — could allow the world to leapfrog gas direct to renewables.', 'Carbon Tracker, a group which monitors climate policy, estimates that $532bn of existing and planned gas projects would become obsolete if the world pursues the aggressive emission cuts needed to limit temperature increases to below 2C above pre-industrial levels, as agreed in the Paris accord.', '“This over-investment in natural gas infrastructure is likely to lead to either emissions overshooting the Paris\u2009goals, or a large number of stranded assets as the shift to cheaper renewables takes place,” says Andrzej Ancygier of Climate Analytics, a green think-tank.', 'Shell’s Mr Wetselaar insists that, under any scenario, gas will be needed to smooth the transition. While batteries can deal with short-term fluctuations in renewable power, they cannot yet address seasonal variations.', 'In the UK, solar power can account for  more than a fifth of electricity generation on a sunny summer day, but contribute almost nothing on a gloomy winter afternoon.  Gas has been critical to Britain’s success in pushing coal to the brink of elimination from its electricity system and reducing emissions to their lowest level since the 19th century, without sacrificing energy security.', 'While the long-mooted “golden age of gas” has yet to fully materialise, global consumption growth is forecast to increase at an average rate of 1.6 per cent a year between now and 2035, according to BP. That is more than twice the 0.7 per cent projected for oil.', 'LNG growth is expected to outstrip the wider gas market and analysts say overcapacity could quickly give way to a supply crunch in the early 2020s once new production is absorbed.', 'After delays and cost-overruns in Australia, companies are cautious about further LNG spending at a time when weak oil prices continue to strain industry finances. Smaller developments are likely to prevail over megaprojects in future. But Eni’s go-ahead in June for the Coral South field in Mozambique — seen as the next big LNG frontier — suggests the dash for gas has further to run.', 'More from the Financial Times: Asia LNG derivatives market catches alightHarvey exposes Achilles heel for global energy market  Michael Bloomberg talks tough on health and junk food']"

Five of the ten most destructive fires in California since 2015 have been linked to PG&E equipment, including the 2018 Camp Fire that destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 85 people.', 'Since then, PG&E has been reducing the risk of equipment sparks by shutting off the power in high fire-risk areas during dry, windy weather. It calls these Public Safety Power Shut-Offs, or PSPS events, and in 2019 they left almost a million customers in the dark for seven days.', '“We essentially lost that full week of service. We lost all of our food supply, we were not able to operate,” said Brennen Jensen, who owns the 100-year-old Hotel Charlotte in Groveland, California.', 'Keeping the power on for 16 million Californians is a big job, as is maintaining the integrity of more than 100,000 miles of power lines while keeping it clear of vegetation that could turn a spark into a deadly wildfire. All this while answering to California regulators and, as an investor-owned utility, shareholders.', '“The management of the company mostly tried in the years leading up to Napa, Sonoma, and Paradise to please shareholders by controlling costs,” said Michael Wara, director of the Stanford University Climate and Energy Policy Program.', 'PG&E’s $5 billion 2021 Fire Mitigation Plan also includes 300 new weather stations to monitor for severe conditions; LiDAR, drones and hundreds of cameras to provide 90% visual coverage of high fire-threat areas; hardening the system by doing things like moving 23 miles of line near Paradise underground; and more aggressive clearing of trees around power lines.', 'It’s also testing new technology. For instance, PG&E has partnered with Grass Valley-based startup BoxPower to build  solar-powered microgrids, housed in shipping containers, to provide safe power for customers in remote areas. The first one serves as the full-time power source for five customers in the mountains of Briceburg, California. Until the remote grid turned on in April, they had been living solely off generator power after a 5,000-acre fire destroyed their high voltage line in 2019. PG&E is aiming to have 20 standalone remote grids operational by 2022, with plans for several hundred more. ', '“PG&E is trying everything you can think of because it knows that it needs to repair its relationship with the state of California,” Wara said.', 'PG&E is also building bigger generator powered back-up microgrids to kick on during PSPS outages. Groveland, where Jensen runs her hotel, was supposed to get one in October 2020. PG&E says it’s now delayed until the end of 2021.', '“It’s going to require a lot of nimble, quick responses and significant investment. And I hope that PG&Eis up to the challenge,” Jensen said.', 'Watch the video to hear from more community members and to see the five-customer microgrid and other fire mitigation efforts PG&E says are proof it’s committed to doing better at keeping their power on and keeping them safe.']"

On the other side of immediate safety concerns, however, is often a new resolve to combat the common factor in these disasters: Climate change. But the size of the problem can make meaningful action seem impossible.', 'Can a single person do anything to meaningfully contribute to climate change relief efforts? Most certainly, say climate change experts. Here are a few simple things you can do right now:', 'Talk about climate change with the people in your life.', '“Every great social justice movement started on the community level,” Jasmine Sanders, executive director of Our Climate, a Washington DC-based youth advocacy organization, told CNBC. That can mean “sitting down with your family to have a conversation about climate change at the dinner table,” she said.', 'So, too, said Jerome Ringo, the co-founder and chairman of climate innovation company Zoetic Global, former leader at the National Wildlife Federation, and global ambassador for the countdown Climate Clock. “Each one teach one,” Ringo told CNBC. When you learn about climate change, pass that information on to your neighbor so they too are able to have a conversation with another person.', '“I call them kitchen conversations where people begin to sit and talk,” Ringo said. A casual conversation could lead to a group coming together and deciding to call their elected representatives or starting a neighborhood recycling program, he said.', 'Take the time to educate yourself about the climate-related stances of elected officials, Adrienne L. Hollis, climate justice and health scientist, told CNBC.', '“Really become familiar with legislation around climate change, for example the executive orders from President Biden, and pieces of legislation that are proposed by various members of Congress,” Hollis said. She focuses on issues of health, environmental justice and climate at her namesake Hollis Environmental Consulting and was previously at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “There are so many opportunities for the public to have input,” Hollis said.', 'If this feels overwhelming to try on your own, join groups that are working on legislative issues already, she said. “People need to know about all of the tools that are available to them, and from that — what tools are needed and missing,” she said. “Get involved locally, regionally and at the federal level.”', 'And keep current on developments. “Knowledge and awareness are power,” Sanders said. “Stay in the know of how climate change is impacting each of us by reading news on a daily basis and then use your superpower to affect change!”', '“The most important thing that individuals can do is vote, and vote on the climate,” Michael E. Mann, professor of atmospheric science at Penn State and director of the Penn State Earth System Science Center, told CNBC.', '“What we really need is systematic change and policies that will rapidly decarbonize our economy, such as subsidies for renewable energy, carbon pricing, and blocking of new fossil fuel infrastructure. As individuals we can’t do these things,” said Mann, who is also the author of “The New Climate War: The Fight to Take Back Our Planet.”', 'Voting is the advice of Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at New York University, too. Specifically, Wagner calls on individuals to “vote well.” You may think that your vote doesn’t really count, given that you’re one voice among millions, but Wagner addresses that in an essay he wrote with the late Martin Weitzman.', '“Get up and vote; it’s the right thing to do. And don’t just vote for the sake of voting. Vote as an informed citizen. Vote well,” Wagner and Weitzman write. ”Vote for a cause larger than yourself. Vote for those who promise more than just to further their own agenda (or yours!). Vote for those who seek to look out for society at large.”', '“To have the most impact on fighting climate change, we need each and every individual to advocate for national and international policies that place a price and cap on carbon emissions,” Jane Gilbert, the first ever Chief Heat Officer of Miami, told CNBC. ', 'The maverick tech billionaire Elon Musk said he supports the idea of a price on carbon, too. “My top recommendation, honestly, would be just add a carbon tax,” Musk told Joe Rogan on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast in February. “The economy works great. Prices and money are just information. ... If the price is wrong, the economy doesn’t do the right thing.”', 'Musk said high concentrations of carbon in the atmosphere and environment are, economically speaking, an “unpriced externality.” An externality happens when some consequence of production is not properly reflected in the market. In this case, it is a negative externality.', 'Those externalities have serious consequences. “Currently, the most vulnerable in our country and world are already paying the price of continuing business as usual,” Gilbert said. “It’s time to place that cost on the fuels itself and take away the land leasing and other subsidies to the fossil fuel industry,” Gilbert said.', 'If a price on carbon were to be implemented, the money raised should be used to “address the inequities of short term price increases as we transition to a clean energy economy and to assist communities in adapting to and recovering from the impacts of climate change,” Gilbert said. ', '“Plant-based eating is a really positive climate influence,” Elin Kelsey, author of “Hope Matters,” told CNBC in a phone conversation in August.', 'Around the globe, livestock are responsible for 14.5% of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Cattle are the worst offenders, responsible for 65% of the emissions caused by all livestock.', '“Whether you’re a flexitarian or vegetarian or vegan, or pescatarian, whatever it is — just eating more plants is is a great direction to be going,” Kelsey told CNBC.', 'Taking responsibility for our own carbon footprint can also mean traveling less said Chris Funk, director of the Climate Hazards Center at UC Santa Barbara and author of the new book, “Drought, Flood, Fire: How Climate Change Contributes to Catastrophes.”', '“According to the EPA, transportation and electricity generation are the two biggest sources of U.S. emissions. Driving less, driving fuel-efficient vehicles, and flying less are straightforward ways that everyone can make a difference,” Funk said ', 'Start a decarbonization plan at home, said Wagner. His own home greening journey was detailed by New York Magazine, and included everything from new insulation to adding a heat pump on the roof and rewiring the house to support it — and it cost over $100,000. But not every project needs to be so extensive.', '“Many households can easily switch to an affordable renewable-oriented electricity plan, and improved insulation and windows make our homes climate-smart while saving us money,” Funk said.', 'As with voting, Wagner provides a rebuke for the statisticians who are ready to provide proof their individual behavior doesn’t matter. “Reducing your own carbon footprint to zero is a noble gesture, but it’s less than a drop in the bucket. Quite literally: the standard U.S. bucket holds about 300,000 drops; but you are one in over 300,000,000 as an American, and you are one in seven billion as a human being,” Wagner and Weitzman write.', '“So why go green at all? Because it’s the right thing to do. It’s also how we learn the values that we have to apply on a much larger scale to tackle climate change,” they write.', 'Also, your behaviors have an impact on those around you. “Recycle. Bike to work. Eat less meat. Maybe go all the way and turn vegetarian. Teach your kids to do the same, and to turn off the water while brushing their teeth. It’s good for you. It’s good for those around you. It’s the right thing to do.”', '“Do anything — anything at all,” Wagner told CNBC. “That begins with talking about climate change. It also means doing what you do best. Students, study. Teachers, teach. Writers, write. Entrepreneurs, invent, build, ship! Whatever it is you do best, consider how climate change figures into it, and do that.”', 'With a bit of research, you are likely to find a community of like-minded individuals, said Kelsey.', '“What are you passionate about? What are you particularly great at....what do you do even if nobody wants you to do it, because you love it so much?” Kelsey told CNBC. “Finding out what really drives you, and recognizing that and then using that voice is the most effective thing to do. ... This individualization and recognizing our own emotional landscape, our own passions, that’s where we do the most good, because those are the things we’ll continue to do.”']"

Now that several states have legalized the use of marijuana for some recreational and medicinal purposes, a big untapped market is emerging for cannabis to be used as a building tool.', 'Across America a grassroots effort is underway among builders, architects, material suppliers and farmers to renew this fledgling market. Mixing hemp’s woody core with lime and water produces a natural, light concrete that retains thermal mass and is highly insulating. No pests, no mold, good acoustics, low humidity, no pesticide.It grows from seed to harvest in about four months. ', 'A catalyst that may spark growth in hemp home building is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s,  R-Ky., Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2018, introduced last week. ', 'If passed, the bill — co-introduced by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. — will remove industrial hemp from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and allow it to be regulated as an agricultural crop. The bill will also authorize and encourage access to federal research funding for hemp and remove restrictions on banking, water rights and other regulatory barriers the hemp industry currently faces. A companion bill has been introduced in the House.', 'All this has Joy Beckerman, president of the Hemp Industries Association, a D.C.-based nonprofit trade association, very excited. “We’ve increased hemp agriculture in the U.S. to more than 25,000 acres,” she said, “and we hope to triple it this year.” (Last year Colorado was the top hemp grower, at nearly 9,700 acres, followed by Kentucky, at around 3,100 acres.)', 'For years this lanky, woody weed has been poorly misunderstood. Like marijuana, its evil twin, it is of the Cannabis sativa species. But that’s where the similarity ends. While marijuana is largely used for medicinal and recreational purposes, hemp is cultivated for its fiber, hurd and seeds and contains just 0.3 percent of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the compound that gets you high.', 'Today at least 25,000 products — including apparel, foods, plastics, skin products and dietary supplements — are made of hemp, and now, with the rising demand of nature-friendly construction, it’s gaining attention worldwide for its use as an alternative to the ubiquitous fiberglass insulation in homebuilding. Hemp-based structural blocks and prefabricated panels for exterior walls are also being introduced into the market. The reason: It’s nontoxic, fireproof, carbon-capturing, mold- and pest-resistant. ', 'Hempcrete,  also known as hemplime, is a biocomposite made from the inner woody core of the hemp plant that is mixed with a lime-based binder and water. The result is a lightweight insulating material weighing only about an eighth of the weight of concrete. In the United States there are currently only about 50 homes containing hemp, in such states as North Carolina, Virginia, Texas and Hawaii, but this natural wonder has been used in construction around the world for centuries. Today it can be found in hundreds of homes and commercial buildings in Canada and Europe, including an eco-house built by Prince Charles.', 'Unlike the Three Little Pigs’ domiciles, made mainly of straw, sticks or bricks, these aren’t literally hemp houses. They’re conventionally designed and built by conventional, if adventurous builders. The homeowner, however, opts to use hemp-based materials for insulation and/or exterior or interior walls as alternatives to customary fiberglass or foam, concrete and wood. Foundations, framing, electrical, plumbing and HVAC can be standard or incorporate “green” materials and systems.', 'A hemp-savvy architect, engineer or consultant from a hemp products maker is often involved, because the materials have distinct specifications and construction requirements. Hemp is adaptable to any climate, and though it can cost slightly more than typical houses — especially if it’s imported — proponents claim the long-term ROI is worth the bump.

', '“We supplied and mixed the hempcrete on site that was used for insulation,” said company founder Greg Flavall, explaining part of the building process.', 'That process begins well before any ground is broken.

ASTM International, a technical standards organization, formed a committee to address this in 2017.', 'Hempcrete is widely used as natural insulation between exterior structural walls built from wood, steel or concrete. It’s airtight yet breathable and flexible, but not load-bearing. “When the cast mix cures, it can be finished in the inside with lime or clay plaster and masonry or wood on the outside,” explained Mario Machnicki, president of American Lime Technology in Chicago, whose hempcrete products have been used in roughly 30 projects in the U.S. and Canada.', 'Machnicki and other suppliers said that hempcrete can cost slightly more than conventional insulation, especially when the hemp hurd has to be imported. “When we started the business 12 years ago, all our hemp was imported from the U.K. and was expensive to ship,” he said. As U.S.-grown hemp becomes more available, pricing for hempcrete will be even more price-competitive, he added.', 'Higher costs, though, won’t necessarily hinder the hemp house market. Already, a segment of the homeowner population has been willing to invest extra for solar power, geothermal heating and air-conditioning and other sustainable building materials, often with the expectation that they’ll save money in the long run on energy costs. There’s also the intangible value of being an innovator and early-adopter, not to mention the “cool” factor.', 'Just BioFiber, founded in Calgary, Alberta, in 2014, has patented prefabricated, structural building blocks made from hemp.

U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said federal agencies are working around-the-clock to help the pipeline return to normal operations.', 'The shutdown arrives at an inopportune time: The beginning of what could be a record summer driving season as Americans make up for last year.', '“Given the size and the direction of the pipeline and the market that it feeds, the Colonial Pipeline is the single most important artery moving refined products in the country,” said Michael Tran, energy analyst at RBC. “This is already an earthquake and the magnitude of the earthquake just grows by the day.”', 'The national average for a gallon of unleaded gasoline jumped to $2.985 Tuesday, an increase of 6 cents in the past week, according to AAA.', 'Regionally, however, the price increases were sharper, AAA found. In South Carolina, for instance, gasoline prices were up more than 6 cents since Monday and 13 cents in the past week. In Georgia, drivers were paying $2.87 per gallon Tuesday, an increase of of more than 10 cents in just one day and 17 cents in a week.', 'A rise of 3 more cents per gallon would put the average U.S. selling price at the highest level since November 2014.', '“We are seeing the full fledge panic at the moment in some of the places I suspected we might see it,” said Tom Kloza, head of global energy analysis at OPIS. “There aren’t enough drivers to take trucks from terminals that have gasoline to stations. We are seeing a lot of stations running out. Georgia seems to be ground zero.”', 'Kloza said he expects gasoline prices to rise, but not spike wildly higher. The bigger issue is that gasoline will be in short supply in the region, since it takes time to replace once the pipeline is switched on and outages could continue.', 'Gasoline in the pipeline travels at just 5 miles per hour.', 'According to GasBuddy, 7.7% of the gas stations in Virginia were out of fuel Tuesday afternoon, while 8.5% of stations in North Carolina have run dry. The impact on gas stations in other states along the pipeline was lower though 5.8% of Georgia stations were out of fuel. And in Georgia, GasBuddy reported that more than 20% of stations in Atlanta were out of gasoline.', 'GasBuddy also notes that gasoline demand on Monday in five key southeastern states was 40.1% greater than it was on the prior Monday. Those states are Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia.', '“Gasoline demand as a whole was up 20%” for the U.S. on Monday, according to Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. De Haan said for each day the pipeline is down, it takes five to seven days to return to normal.', '“Refiners are starting to book tankers to store product off shore because it’s backing up in the system,” said Kilduff.', '“You have a weird kind of problem,” he added. “U.S. Gulf Coast refinery operating levels are at record highs. They were over 90%. They have the opposite problem. There’s a surfeit of supply building in the Gulf Coast region.”', 'Some refiners, like Motiva, have already cut back runs.', 'Again Capital’s Kilduff said traders are watching to see if the U.S. will waive the Jones Act to allow non-U.S. ships to transport gasoline to U.S. ports.', 'Under the Jones Act, a U.S.-flagged ship must be used to transport goods from one U.S. port to another, but in an emergency, refiners could seek a waiver so they could ship fuel to the southeast ports.', 'The New York region could be spared the worst of it, since it is served by Philadelphia and New Jersey refineries, and there are increased shipments of gasoline from Europe already booked for the U.S,. said Kilduff.', '“There’s bookings out of Europe to come to the U.S. That’s why we’re seeing pressure on gas prices,” said Kilduff, noting RBOB gasoline futures were barely higher. Futures had initially jumped on concerns about shortages, but had given back most of their gains. Jefferies noted that at least six tankers were booked to ship gasoline from Europe.', 'Currently, more fuel is being moved by truck. Truckers have been given temporary hours of service exemptions, but Kloza of OPIS said the problem of too few truckers is an issue for the effort. The lack of truckers had already been straining supply in some areas.', '“To put it in perspective, if a tanker truck can hold 250 barrels of gasoline and the Atlanta area consumers need over 200,000 barrels of gasoline, you need more than 1,000 trucks a day,” said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.', 'Lipow said that also doesn’t solve the supply problem for diesel-fueled trucks or the issue airlines face if they can’t get jet fuel. The pipeline carries 1.5 million barrels a day of gasoline and about 1.2 million barrels of distillates, which includes diesel and jet fuel.', '“Jet fuel is a concern because it’s only stored at airports. They’re at risk of running out of jet fuels and airlines have to make alternative plans, loading up aircraft before they fly into those airports, making sure they have supplies before they go to their next destination,” Lipow said.', 'American Airlines said the impact so far was minimal, but that it was adding stops to two long-haul flights from Charlotte to conserve fuel at the North Carolina hub.']"

96,Wal-Mart scraps Amazon Prime competitor in favor of new free shipping tactic,2017-01-31T05:01:00+0000,"[' Wal-Mart is scrapping its ShippingPass program, a  fee-based, two-day shipping service it was testing to compete  with Amazon’s Prime. ', '  Instead, the world’s largest retailer will offer free two-day  shipping on more than 2 million items when shoppers spend at  least $35. That’s down from its previous spending threshold of  $50, and its prior delivery window of three to five days.', '  The shift is one of the first major changes Marc Lore has made at  Wal-Mart since the retailer purchased his start-up, Jet.com, last  year. ', '  Wal-Mart will give the undisclosed number of members who paid for  a ShippingPass subscription a full refund. ', '  “In this day and age, two-day shipping is really just table  stakes,” Lore, now president and CEO of Walmart U.S. eCommerce,  said Monday. “We don’t think it’s necessary to charge a membership [fee] for it.”', '  Wal-Mart first started testing its ShippingPass program in  May 2015. It pumped up the program ahead of Amazon’s second Prime  Day sales event, when it offered a free 30-day trial. But the  program never took off to the same degree as Prime.', '  Though Wal-Mart’s service offered an unlimited number of free  deliveries for just $49 a year — $50 less than the cost of  Prime — it lacked the ancillary perks that have made Prime  so addictive. Those include Amazon’s vast network of streaming  video, music and unlimited photo storage. There also are  members-only deals and it recently introduced a credit card  that gives Prime members 5 percent back on their Amazon  purchases.', '  These types of perks encourage shoppers to stay loyal to  Amazon.', '  In an interview with CNBC over the holidays, Leon Nicholas,  chief insights officer at Kantar Retail, said Wal-Mart was simply  too late to the subscription game. Roughly one-third of Wal-Mart  shoppers are Prime members, according to Kantar’s data  — and they have little incentive to switch, Nicholas  said.', '  Prime has more than 50 million members in the U.S., according to  Cowen and Co. Its renewal rates have been pegged at north of  90 percent. According to Kantar’s data, the biggest reason Prime  members renew their subscriptions is for free two-day shipping  — which Wal-Mart will now provide for customers  spending $35 or more. ', 'Wal-Mart’s offer will apply to 2 million products, compared  with more than 40 million eligible products on Prime. Lore  emphasized that the 2 million items account for the vast majority  of what its customers are purchasing. ', '  “There won’t be too many products that you’ll want that won’t be  available [for] two-day shipping,” Lore said, adding that the  items will be skewed toward everyday essentials including pet  food and cleaning supplies.', '  Wal-Mart’s lower spending threshold comes as retailers including  Target and Urban Outfitters have said that a  larger-than-anticipated acceleration in their online sales dented  their margins over the holidays. ', '  Though Lore did not address how the shift could impact the  company’s margins, he said the minimum spending requirement  encourages shoppers to build bigger baskets. The executive  founded Jet.com on that principle, by using a pricing algorithm  that saves customers money when they add more items to their  basket. Jet also offers free shipping on orders of $35 or more.', '  Spokeswoman Danit Marquardt added that the scale of Wal-Mart’s  distribution network allows it to create efficiencies that it can  then pass along to the consumer through lower prices and shipping  costs.', ' “It’s not going to affect our pricing at all. In fact,  we’re going to look to get more aggressive on the price side,”  Lore said. He said more changes to Wal-Mart’s digital strategy  will be announced shortly.']"

As crude  prices have plummeted, bargain-buying has driven up demand, while  owners have moved more aggressively to scrap vessels to head off  the kind of surplus seen in the dry bulk market.', '  Symeon Pariaros, chief administrative officer of Athens-run and  New York-listed shipping firm Euroseas, said the outlook for the  dry bulk market was “very challenging”.', '  “Demand fundamentals are so weak. The Chinese economy, which is  the main driver of dry bulk, is way below expectations,” he  added. “Only companies with very strong balance sheets will get  through this storm.”', '  The dry bulk shipping downturn began in 2008, after the onset of  the financial crisis, and has worsened significantly this year as  the Chinese economy has slowed. The Baltic Exchange’s main BDI  index - which gauges the cost of shipping such commodities, also  including cement and fertiliser - is more than 95 percent down  from a record high hit in 2008.', '  The index is often regarded as a forward-looking economic  indicator. With about 90 percent of the world’s traded goods by  volume transported by sea, global investors look to the BDI for  any signs of changes in sentiment for industrial demand.', '  “The state of the dry bulk market especially indicates that  economies worldwide are likely to stay weak, much to the  disappointment of central banks ... FX traders, miners, steel  makers, trading houses, and commodity economies,” said Basil  Karatzas, head of New York consultancy and brokerage Karatzas  Marine Advisors & Co.', '  Ratings agency Fitch downgraded the shipping sector to negative,  from stable, this month due to slowing global trade and an  economic slowdown in emerging markets, adding that dry bulk would  remain under pressure.', ' Commodity pressure', '  Slowing demand and concerns over the health of the Chinese and  global economies have pushed the 19-commodity Thomson  Reuters/Core Commodity CRB Index, which tracks the prices of 19  commodities including oil and grains, to its lowest level since  2002.', '  “There is no doubt that the overall macro situation is one that  does not engender a lot of confidence for increased trade flows  in 2016 and beyond,” said Khalid Hashim, managing director of  Precious Shipping, one of Thailand’s largest dry cargo ship  owners.', '  Worsening conditions have already claimed casualties.', '  In September, Japanese bulk carrier Daiichi Chuo Kisen Kaisha  filed for protection from creditors, and private equity backed  Global Maritime Investment Cyprus Ltd filed for Chapter 11  bankruptcy protection in the United States.', '  Smaller dry bulk ship owners are expected to struggle in coming  months.', '  “There are clearly big problems for almost all dry bulk owners,  certainly those who cannot subsidise dry bulk through ownership  in tankers.

Small private  companies without obvious external support will be at the most  risk.”', '  Ship owners are also contending with more vessel orders, which  are expected to increase oversupply further.', '  While the dry bulk market has been in a downturn since 2008,  there have been brief rebound periods of relatively good earnings  in that time that emboldened ship owners to order more vessels,  which normally take up to three years to deliver.', '  “Too many factors are against ship owners at present, and January  sees a disproportionate delivery of vessels from the shipyards,”  said Karatzas.', '  Analysis from Axia Capital Markets showed the cumulative loss of  revenues for 13 shipping companies publicly listed in New York  reached over $3.36 billion in the first nine months of 2015.', '  “Given the current oversupply of vessels in the marketplace that  has built up over the past five years, we expect rates to remain  at depressed levels for at least two more years as the market  struggles to find a new equilibrium,” said Robert Perri of Axia  Capital Markets.', ' Diverging fortunes', '  By contrast, demand for oil tankers and the rates they command  have surged to their highest levels since 2008 in the past three  months.', '  Dry bulk shipping markets have been hit hard by a slide in demand  for coal by China, which is also trying to ease its dependence on  the polluting fuel and meet environmental pledges.', '  But the country has been looking to boost strategic reserves of  crude, taking advantage of multi-year lows in prices, which has  helped the oil tanker market rally. Earlier this month China said  it more than doubled the size of its strategic crude oil reserves  between November 2014 and the middle of this year, a rate  exceeding analysts’ estimates.', '  Oil tanker players have been more conservative since 2008 in  ordering ships as they experienced rock-bottom rates that saw  earnings falling below zero as recently as last year, meaning  owners clocked up losses every day. The scrapping of tankers,  which picked up in 2011, has also shrunk the fleet.', '  Average earnings for supertankers hauling 2 million barrels of  oil on the benchmark Middle East Gulf to Japan route have surged  to over $110,000 a day.', '  In contrast, average earnings for capesize ships, among the  largest vessels used to haul coal and iron ore, have slumped to  under $5,000 a day in recent weeks - below the basic operating  cost level a ship needs to break even, which is around $8,000.', '  “The (tanker) market is on fire,” said Deutsche Bank analyst Amit  Mehrotra, but added: “Owners of dry bulk ships are likely to  spend the holiday break quietly reflecting on how they will  further endure the worst market many have seen in their  lifetimes.”']"

Those surveyed included households in Canada and 13 U.S. states: California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Ohio, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.', 'The majority of these Starlink users are in rural or remote areas, such as farmland or wilderness, with limited access to terrestrial broadband options — and a few with no access altogether.', '“I expect to keep the service long term,” a user in Montana told CNBC. “The price of the beta for the service is more reasonable than any other option we have, and those are worse in performance. I will keep Starlink as long as its the only broadband option available to me.”', 'Starlink is the company’s capital-intensive project to build an interconnected internet network with thousands of satellites, known in the space industry as a constellation, designed to deliver high-speed internet to consumers anywhere on the planet.', 'SpaceX launched the “Better than Nothing Beta” program for the public in October, and the majority of users CNBC surveyed received invitations to join between November and February. The service is priced at $99 a month in the U.S. under the beta, with a $499 upfront cost for the equipment customers need to connect to the satellites — plus taxes, shipping and any accessories needed to mount the antenna.', 'CNBC surveyed users on total cost, the installation process, what they thought of SpaceX’s equipment, internet speed, reliability of the service, what their service alternatives were, their experience with customer service, any concerns they had, and their overall impressions. Here’s what users said.', 'SpaceX priced the user equipment well below its actual cost, with the company currently absorbing about two-thirds of the cost of the customer equipment.', 'Users’ upfront costs ranged from $550 to as much as $800 — varying based on taxes, shipping costs, and additional equipment needed such as roof mounts or third-party items for installation.', 'Most users found the service’s monthly price of $99 to be fair, and often a discount to other satellite broadband services and terrestrial options — especially given the average speed of Starlink’s service. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell last week said the company does not plan to add “tiered pricing to consumers,” emphasizing that it wants “to try to keep it as simple as possible and transparent as possible.”', 'The “Starlink Kit” that is sent to customers includes four significant parts: The user terminal (also known as the antenna), a tripod mount, a Wi-Fi router, and a power supply. SpaceX also offers rooftop mounting options for an additional cost.', 'Users were largely impressed with quality of the equipment, especially the antenna — which is nicknamed “Dishy McFlatface” in the SpaceX guide.', '“Barring a massive hailstorm, I don’t see much hurting this thing at all,” one user said.', 'A handful of users were disappointed in the quality of SpaceX’s supplied Wi-Fi router, with several choosing to go with third-party router options. A Montana user described it as “a brick with a wifi signal,” noting that it is quick to set up but lacks configuration options aside from setting the network’s password.', '“I opted to use my own router and plugged directly into the port their router would have been connected to,” the Montana user said.', 'The installation process delivered the widest range of user opinions, as some — mostly those who have performed rooftop equipment installations before — found it a very easy process while others had to spend hours to get the antenna working.', '“The hardest part was getting up on the roof, mounting the dish and running the wire from the outside to the inside of the house,” a Colorado user said.', 'Obstructions to the antenna’s view of the sky, and therefore connection to overhead satellites, was the most frequent issue for users installing the dish. A mobile application for Starlink users includes an augmented reality feature to check for obstructions and help find the right place to install the antenna.', '“My trees are really tall and I underestimated the need for the Starlink’s obstruction-detecting app to really show 0 trees,” a user in Oregon said.', 'SpaceX told the Federal Communications Commission in February that Starlink’s internet service is “exceeding” 100 megabits per second download speeds, 20 Mbps upload speeds, and latency “at or below 31 milliseconds.” Latency is the amount of delay in an internet network, defining how much time it takes a signal to travel back and forth from a destination. Latency and download speeds are key measures for an internet service provider.', 'The company’s report to the FCC matched what CNBC was told by users, who reported download speeds ranging between 60 Mbps and 150 Mbps — with some even reporting peak speeds near 200 Mbps. Latency also matched expectations, as most users reported latency of about 30 milliseconds — with some in the low 20 milliseconds.', 'Musk promised earlier this year that Starlink’s performance will continue to improve as the company launches more satellites, saying “speed will double” to about 300 Mbps later this year and latency will be more consistently in the 20 millisecond range.', 'SpaceX has warned that users would experience drops in service during the beta, given it does not yet have its full satellite fleet in orbit. In a 24-hour period, most users saw a handful of downtimes between three and five minutes. Sometimes downtimes were as short as 20 seconds, while a few users reported downtimes between 10 and 20 minutes. The Starlink application also gives users a countdown to when the next satellite is expected to reconnect service.', '“The service is quite reliable, there are a few outages once in a while,” a Maine user said. “We mostly use it to watch Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube. We do a bit of gaming as well on the system with no issues.”', 'Users who spoke to CNBC said they use multiple devices without any impact on the service’s quality or speed.', '“We are online all day, every day on meetings. It sustains that easily. We also use streaming services. Combined with my in-laws, we have at least 25 devices (smart phones, laptops, desktops, iPads, smart tv, smart home devices, etc.),” a user in Minnesota said.', 'In addition to the reliability of the internet service itself, users said the Starlink equipment has held up well in the elements. Users reported the Starlink antenna continuing to work in the midst of heavy winds, rainfall and snowstorms. Additionally, as some users’ remote locations require they pay close attention to power consumption, users say the equipment does not draw too much power, with a user in California saying that “it’s about the same consumption as the flood light bulb that lights our driveway.”', 'Users reported a wide variety of prior services they had before Starlink, ranging from other satellite broadband companies to low-speed wired networks to cellular hotspots — and some with no prior service at all.', 'Starlink users most commonly switched for one of three reasons: Price, speed and data restrictions (also known as “caps”). A user in Ohio said they paid $180 per month to a local service provider that advertised faster speeds, but they found Starlink to be faster on average. A California user previously had satellite service they said “was slightly more reliable” in terms of outages, but download speeds were 1 Mbps with a latency of around 1,000 milliseconds.', '“I keep asking my local [telecommunications technicians] if fiber will ever roll out in my town, and they say ‘5 years to never’ each time,” a Montana user said.', 'A user in Canada said their area has two local “high speed” internet service providers but that the cost was far too high by comparison.', '“Both require substantial investment in hardware (towers, dishes, etc), have pretty restrictive data-caps and do not guarantee speeds. In short, they are s---,” the Canadian user said.', 'SpaceX’s core business to date has been launching rockets, so the customer service aspect of becoming an internet service provider is new to the company. Only a handful of users told CNBC they had reached out about issues, but each was happy with how SpaceX responded.', 'One user in Oregon said they were “unable to connect initially” when setting up their Starlink service.', '“I opened a support case and they responded, and then called me, within a few hours. They had to adjust something on their end, and the issue was resolved that afternoon,” the user said.', 'Another user in Minnesota said that “support responses have been great,” noting that “usually within 1-2 hours I’ll hear back from someone” at SpaceX.', 'The biggest concern voiced by those surveyed centered around the possibility of SpaceX introducing data restrictions in the future. A few expect restrictions to be inevitable, and one user said they “will immediately be cancelling service without hesitation if there are any data caps.”', 'Asked what restrictions they’d find acceptable, users said they would be satisfied with data caps between 750 gigabytes to 1 terabyte per month.', 'The installation process and the apparent “lacking of grounding for lightning” in the equipment was a concern for a California user.', '“Running the cable into the house probably won’t be easy for the general public,” the user said.', 'That user said they had not integrated the Starlink equipment into their home network due to the grounding concern, saying, “I don’t want an errant strike to blow up all my network gear and server.”', '“I’d like to think that SpaceX has thought about that but it doesn’t seem to be called out in documentation anywhere, so to minimize the risk I’m keeping everything separate for now,” the California user said.', 'Starlink users were fairly ecstatic in their overall impressions with the service, with nearly all expecting to keep it long-term.', '“The experience has been great, support from Starlink has been awesome, and updates keep getting pushed to the Starlink app,” a Maine user said. “I’m extremely happy with everything.”', 'Users also emphasized a key point that SpaceX itself has said, which is that the service is a boon for those in rural areas but not a replacement for the existing internet service of people in cities.', '“This a game changer for rural America,” a Montana user said. “I think there is a lot of people who now have options to work remotely due to the pandemic that will utilize this service.”', 'While SpaceX has begun accepting pre-orders for service, with more southern parts of the U.S. expected to get access in the year ahead, the company does not yet have a time frame for when Starlink will exit the beta phase and begin full commercial service. SpaceX’s Shotwell said earlier this month that the company has “a lot of work to do to make the network reliable,” a fact emphasized by a user in Wyoming.', '“Be prepared — it’s beta. Outages are to be expected, tech support may be slow. This is not meant for consumers wanting to do full production without interruption or delayed support,” the Wyoming user said.', 'For now, even with Starlink’s limitations, many users are simply excited to have access to a new high-speed service.', '“I’m downright giddy to have real internet after living without for 14 years,” an Oregon user said. “I can just watch a show, without worrying about whether I’ll hit my bandwidth cap. I can download a new game when I want to, instead of having to take my laptop to a friend’s house. It’s a bit of a lifestyle change.”']"
100,"JBS cyberattack: From gas to meat, hackers are hitting the nation, and consumers, where it hurts",2021-06-02T17:19:50+0000,"['Cybersecurity is a topic that often fails to get the attention of the public until a headline hits about a company that has their personal information, including credit card and Social Security numbers, being the victim of a hack. But over the past month, a different threat has taken precedence that goes much deeper into the psyche, and everyday lives, of Americans: ransomware attacks that take down major energy and food supply infrastructure and raise fears about being able to buy key consumer commodities like gas and meat at affordable prices.', 'A month ago, the hack of the Colonial Pipeline, which controls 45% of fuel in the Eastern U.S., led to panic buying of gas. This week’s ransomware attack on the world’s biggest meat processing company, JBS, escalated concerns about the potential for a spike in meat prices and food supply as a national security threat.', 'These cyberattacks have evolved beyond theft of data to physical assets with consumer impacts. Hackers often encrypt data on systems and demand ransom to decrypt it, but in these cases, the primary targets have shifted from the data alone to consumer-facing services. On Wednesday, the ferry service to popular New England vacation destination Martha’s Vineyard was a minor example of the infrastructure added to the list of ransomware attack targets. It’s not a new idea — it can be seen in already common cyber incidents like taking down consumer websites in denial of service attacks — but in the Colonial and JBS hacks, the criminals are digging deeper into critical national infrastructure controlled by business interests.', '“There is a growing trend of cyber criminals going after bigger fish now and ripple effects in the supply chain,” said Derek Manky, chief of security insights and global threat alliances at Fortinet’s FortiGuard Labs. “It’s getting down to the producer level and if they can hit that target effectively it will have an impact on the consumer, not targeting the consumer directly, but it does have that consequence.”', 'JBS has a global supply chain that relies on connections as far apart as Australia (one of the largest sources of imported beef to the U.S. after Canada) to North America. The cyberattack led to temporary shutdowns of several plants in the U.S., though the company said many operations were coming back online Wednesday and facilities shipping product again, easing concerns about pricing.', 'The underlying cyber issues for the food sector, however, will remain.', 'The meat processing industry has become highly concentrated among a handful of players including JBS, which controls over 20% of the cattle harvesting industry in the U.S. And it is an industry which has been behind on building its cyber defenses, according to experts.', '“This attack demonstrates the reach of these events, shutting down meat plants in Australia and impacting meat processing in North America,” said John Hoffman, senior research fellow at the University of Minnesota’s Food Protection and Defense Institute and a retired U.S. Army Colonel.', 'JBS has grown from a Brazilian cattle company to a global giant operating in over six countries and that through ownership of the Swift brand became the world’s largest beef processor. In the U.S., it sells beef and pork through major retailers including Costco.', '“It brings home these attacks, when they occur now, are no longer local,” Hoffman said. “This is a primary protein supplier and major supplier, and simultaneous effects in North America and Australia.”', 'The complexity built into the current global food supply chain can benefit consumers in keeping costs down and providing yearlong access to items grown around the world depending on seasonality. But that complexity also results in risks that rise to the level of critical infrastructure.', 'For a hacker whose objective in a ransomware attack is to force payment, a food manufacturing and processing company like JBS, a centralized node in a consolidated industry, makes for a good target. If successfully attacked, the hack can result in widespread problems from the cattle on the pasture to the feedlots and into the grocery store. JBS USA says it has the capacity to process more than 200,000 cattle, 500,000 hogs, 45 million chickens and 80,000 small stock (lambs, sheep, goats and veal calves) per week.', 'Covid exposed how the concentration in the meat processing sector could quickly create unexpected issues related to food security and pricing. The ability to delivery livestock to plants was cut off amid shutdowns for health safety reasons, and those supply chains were thrown out of alignment for weeks, hitting both the farms and the consumers.', 'A 2019 fire at a single Tyson Foods processing plant in Kansas caused cattle prices to fall and retail beef prices to jump. A hint of those market dislocations was seen again on Tuesday. Cattle futures fell on fears that meat processing shutdowns would suspend the ability to move cows from the pasture and feedlot to the slaughterhouse, while at the same time fears rose about potential price hikes in stores and restaurants.', '“This is another demonstration of how vulnerable the beef supply chain is,” said Bill Bullard, the CEO of R-Calf USA, a group representing cattle ranching interests which has been pressing the government for years to do more about consolidation in the beef industry. JBS and its peers are under existing antitrust scrutiny from the federal government.', 'JBS, Tyson, Cargill and National Beef are the four dominant players in the meatpacking industry.', '“Centralized systems are vulnerable to all kinds of shocks,” Bullard said. “Cattle is the single-largest sector of agriculture and a major protein source for Americans.”', 'The food and agriculture sector has not received the attention from the government when it comes to national security threats that other sectors have historically. It was not deemed a critical infrastructure sector by the federal government until 2003, and many industry players are still playing catch-up on technology. The Food Safety Modernization Act of 2010, meanwhile, placed limited emphasis on cybersecurity.', '“I think this sends a strong message to both government and industry that they need to work on hardening these systems” Hoffman said. “The food industry will really have to step up their cyber game, take a critical look at each major component of infrastructure and supply chain segments.”', 'Meat processing companies have legacy operating technology systems that may have been installed decades ago and are not replaced every few years like IT systems. These OT systems running plant floors are now being connected to each other and with IT systems through new Internet of Things architecture, creating vulnerabilities for hackers to exploit. In a meat processing plant this setup can include devices like multiple digital sensors monitoring temperature and pressure and ingredients, all connected to a global network for packaging and distribution — and executive management and managers in plants using the real-time data dashboards globally — creating multiple attack points.', '“There is a path of least resistance to go after IT and OT systems on the plant floor that have critical dependencies on those IT systems,” Manky said. ', 'For financial reasons, as well as data consistency, it can make sense to have a centralized network rather a highly distributed architecture across an organization. “There is a lot of shared infrastructure on all systems tied tightly together,” said John Sheehy, senior vice president, research and strategy at IOActive, which has been studying the threat of food supply chain hacking for years.', 'JBS has not offered much information about the nature of the hack, but did indicate it had backups available, which is considered a fundamental part of competent cyber strategy. But experts said there were questions about its “segmentation” of technology that will need to be answered in an attack that took down operations in both the U.S. and Australia. It is possible the company took down some operations as a preventative measure.', 'JBS did not respond to a request for comment.', 'Concerns exist that nation-state actors will test the pressure points of critical infrastructure through hacks so that during future periods of geopolitical conflict they can sow more chaos by disrupting supply chains. Food supply of an adversary is an example. The JBS attack, based on all the available information, does not rise to that level. It was criminal, if strategic in nature, but according to the U.S. government, it is one more example of Russia providing safe haven to hackers hitting key supply chains, an issue expected to be on the agenda when President Biden meets with Russian president Vladimir Putin later this month in Geneva for a summit.', '“This is the second major ransomware attack where the government has identified the attackers are geographically based in Russia and this is a significant political issue,” Sheehy said. “It is not clear there is any Russian government support for these criminal organizations, but there is concern they are allowing them to operate fully.”  ', 'The idea that a ransomware attack could ripple through the supply chain and end up hitting consumers is not unprecedented. The 2019 ransomware attack on metals giant Norsk Hydro is in some respects similar as far as a broad supply chain threat stretching from the commodities market to the consumer.

The company was very nearly named “Cadabra,” but it sounded too much like “cadaver,” so Bezos chose Amazon. ', 'The website opened for business on July 16, 1995. Its homepage greeted users with the proclamation of being “Earth’s biggest bookstore,” spanning 1 million titles and offering up “consistently low prices.” Traffic shot up shortly after launch when one of the founders of Yahoo offered to feature Amazon on its “What’s Cool” list, according to The Wall Street Journal. ', '“We thought about it some, and we realized it might be like taking a sip from a fire hose, but we decided to go ahead and go for it,” Bezos recalled, according to the Journal. Within the first month of its launch, Amazon had sold books in every state in the U.S. and 45 countries around the world.  ', 'After a successful IPO in 1997 that made Bezos a millionaire, the CEO successfully navigated Amazon through the dot-com bubble. Even as his net worth skyrocketed, Bezos continued to drive a Honda Accord, saying in a CBS “60 Minutes” interview, “This is a perfectly good car.”', 'In 1999, Bezos was named Time magazine’s Person of the Year. His face appeared on the magazine’s cover, surrounded by a computer mouse and packing peanuts, with the tagline, “e-commerce is changing the way the world shops.”', 'It’s easy to forget that Wall Street wasn’t always singing the praises of the so-called flywheel effect of Amazon’s various businesses. Bezos clashed with Wall Street in Amazon’s early years as a public company. He prioritized growth and strategic bets over pressure from investors to turn a quarterly profit. Bezos reminded investors of that philosophy each year in Amazon’s annual letter to shareholders, when he would attach his first letter from 1997, which proclaimed in one section: “It’s All About the Long Term.”', 'Bezos oversaw two innovations that would be critical to Amazon’s future success.', 'In 2005, facing steep competition from eBay, Amazon debuted its Prime membership program. The program offered consumers “all-you-can-eat” free, two-day shipping, for $79 per year. Investors were initially skeptical about the costly membership program, with one analyst commenting at the time, “Demand is there but the way the company is positioning itself right now, it’s deciding to reward its customers before its investors.”', 'Still, Prime quickly raised the bar for retailers all over the world, at a time when four- to six-day shipping was the standard. On Amazon’s website, Bezos wrote that Prime was meant to “take the effort out of ordering.”', '“We expect Amazon Prime to be expensive for Amazon.com in the short term,” Bezos wrote. “In the long term, we hope to earn even more of your business, which will make it good for us too.”', 'Bezos’ idea that Prime would attract more business to Amazon proved prescient. Prime members, which now total more than 200 million worldwide, spend more and shop more often. And Bezos gave them reason to keep subscribing to Prime by adding access to video and music streaming, Whole Foods discounts and other perks. ', 'The launch of Prime also helped to grow Amazon’s burgeoning footprint of warehouses, which it refers to as “fulfillment centers.” Amazon sprawling fulfillment network, married with an armada of planes, trucks and vans, has enabled it to rival shipping carriers UPS, FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service.', 'One year after Prime debuted, Amazon began rolling out cloud-computing services. Amazon had built internal technology infrastructure to handle complex, data-intensive tasks. ', 'The company realized it could offer the same technology to other businesses, allowing them to offload their data storage and compute capacity and rent it all from Amazon. The idea for Amazon Web Services was formulated at an executive retreat at Bezos’ house in 2003, according to TechCrunch.', 'Since then, AWS has cemented itself as the main profit engine for its parent company. It remains the market leader in cloud-computing services, but competitors Microsoft, Alibaba and Google have caught up in recent years.', 'As Bezos transformed Amazon into a corporate giant, he largely maintained an air of mystery, keeping his personal life tightly guarded. But in 2019, any semblance of obscurity Bezos had maintained imploded.', 'In January 2019, Bezos announced he and his wife were divorcing after 25 years of marriage. Then, the National Enquirer reported about his affair with Lauren Sanchez, a former TV anchor, including intimate texts and photos.', 'Bezos responded by publishing a Medium essay, titled “No thank you, Mr. Pecker,” detailing how the tabloid led by Donald Trump pal David Pecker threatened to post a “below the belt selfie” and other intimate photos if he didn’t drop claims that the paper’s coverage was politically motivated. Bezos drew connections to National Enquirer owner American Media’s relationships with former President Trump and the Saudi government. American Media said it acted lawfully.', 'Prior to the tabloid scandal, Trump had been steadily escalating his attacks against Bezos and Amazon, accusing it of everything from evading local taxes to taking unfair advantage of the U.S. Postal Service. The feud was spurred by Bezos’ ownership of The Washington Post, which often published reporting and opinion pieces that were critical of the president.', 'The scandal came as Amazon and the rest of “big tech” — Facebook, Apple and Alphabet’s Google — faced a steady drumbeat of antitrust allegations. Last July, Bezos testified via video before lawmakers critical of his company’s growing scope and power. It was his first time before Congress.', 'In his last annual letter as CEO, published in April, Bezos signaled he was reckoning with a major criticism of his company. Amazon could no longer just focus on customers at the expense of its workforce. It had to heed calls to make the company a better place to work and create value for workers. In July, Bezos codified those ideas in the company’s list of corporate values.', 'Bezos promised that Amazon could achieve the goal of being the world’s best employer, while being its most consumer-centric company.', '“If any shareowners are concerned that Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work might dilute our focus on Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company, let me set your mind at ease,” Bezos wrote. “Think of it this way. If we can operate two businesses as different as consumer ecommerce and AWS, and do both at the highest level, we can certainly do the same with these two vision statements. In fact, I’m confident they will reinforce each other.”', 'As he was building Amazon into one of the most valuable companies in the world, making him the world’s richest person starting in 2017, Bezos kept chasing his childhood dreams of space travel in the background.', 'Bezos founded Blue Origin in 2000, but the then-fledgling rocket company remained secretive about its plans until he selected the tiny West Texas town of Van Horn to serve as its launch facility. Local ranchers and residents remained skeptical of the billionaire’s plans to move into town.', 'By 2005, Bezos had acquired 165,000 acres of land in Van Horn, known as “Corn Ranch.” At the time, he gave an interview to the local weekly newspaper, the Van Horn Advocate, detailing his goal of sending a spaceship into orbit, launching and landing the craft vertically.', 'Years later, Bezos said one of Blue Origin’s goals was to move high-polluting industries off of Earth -- the same vision he espoused after graduating from high school. Doing so would be critical to the future of the planet, he added.', '“We humans have to go to space if we are going to continue to have a thriving civilization,” Bezos told CBS News in a July 2019 interview. “We have become big as a population, as a species, and this planet is relatively small. We see it in things like climate change and pollution and heavy industry. We are in the process of destroying this planet. And we have sent robotic probes to every planet in the solar system — this is the good one. So, we have to preserve this planet.”', 'Bezos signaled his deepening commitment to Blue Origin in 2017, when he announced he would sell $1 billion in Amazon stock annually to invest in the venture. At that point, the billionaire space race was beginning to heat up, with fellow billionaires Richard Branson and SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk also vying to go to space.', 'In 2019, Bezos unveiled Blue Origin’s first lunar lander. Called “Blue Moon,” the spacecraft is designed to deliver cargo and astronauts to the moon’s surface by 2024.', 'But going to the moon is just the beginning of Bezos’ vision. Bezos foresees free-floating colonies in space that are capable of supporting 1 trillion people.', '“I don’t think we’ll live on planets, by the way. I think we’ll live in giant O’Neill-style space colonies. Gerard O’Neill, decades ago, came up with this idea,” Bezos said in a 2019 speech at the Yale Club in New York City, referring to the work of the physicist. “The space colonies we’ll build will have many advantages. The primary one is that they’ll be close to Earth.”', 'While it may be some time before humans move into utopian space colonies, Bezos on Tuesday fulfilled one of Blue Origin’s major milestones by completing its first successful passenger spaceflight.', 'In an interview with CNBC’s Morgan Brennan after returning to the planet, Bezos said the flight was “a tiny little step” in Blue Origin’s broader plan. Blue Origin is also developing a reusable rocket called New Glenn that’s built for orbital space travel, Bezos said.', '“Really though we need to build the infrastructure. When Amazon started, we didn’t have to build a package delivery network. It already existed,” Bezos said. “If you want to be a space entrepreneur today, you have to do everything from the very beginning. There’s no real infrastructure that’s at an affordable cost.”', 'Relieved from the day-to-day duties of running Amazon, Bezos can now focus more of his attention on Blue Origin.', '“Since I stepped down as the CEO of Amazon, I have a lot of time to dedicate to this vision,” he said.']"

Because Line 3  would replace an existing cross-border pipeline, the company  argues it would not need the presidential permit that has held up  Keystone XL.', '  If all the projects are approved, more than 4.1 million barrels  of oil could flow through Canada by 2018.

They could  also provide more direct routes to other markets, like those  burgeoning in China and India.', '  Much of the crude that would have been refined in Gulf Coast  refineries would have then been shipped to end users in Asia. But  cutting out the U.S. middleman could mean more crude going  straight to Asia – and new refineries in Asian countries to  process it.', '  The threat of cheap crude slipping through America’s fingers to  China has become a key talking point for pipeline advocates.

Without the pipeline, the supply of  oil has so far exceeded the oil companies’ capacity to ship it  out of land-locked Alberta to its largest market -- the  U.S.', '  The glut has driven down prices, making development in the region  less attractive. A pipeline would not only make shipping faster  and easier, it would lower the cost of transport, making the  product still more attractive to customers.', '  “Industry plans to triple tar sands production over the next 20  years, and they simply will not be able to do it without pipeline  capacity,” said Anthony Swift, an attorney with the National  Resources Defense Council, a vocal opponent of the project.  “We’re seeing projects begin to get canceled as it becomes  apparent that pipelines aren’t coming in as quickly as industry  expected.”', '  But even without the pipeline, and with the canceled projects,  production is rising. A market assessment by Canada’s National  Energy Board released in November estimated that Canadian crude  production is on track to soar to nearly 6 million barrels per  day -- thanks in large part to oil coming from the sticky sands  that have become the symbol of the debate over the energy future  of North America.', 'CORRECTION: This version corrected the amount of oil that would be transported to nearly 1 million barrels a day.', ' —By Lisa Riordan Seville, NBC News.']"

116,One of SpaceX’s most ambitious projects remains tethered to the ground — for now,2020-06-28T14:01:02+0000,"['To fund its Martian ambitions, SpaceX intends to transform the Earth — blanketing the planet in ubiquitous internet coverage beamed down from a tight-fitting mesh of thousands of satellites. CEO Elon Musk expects this “Starlink” service to eventually generate $30 billion per year.', 'In space, construction is advancing smoothly. SpaceX has already become the world’s largest satellite operator, managing more than 500 satellites and counting. That’s a fraction of the thousands it intends to launch, but enough for the system to reach Air Force cockpits and connect Musk to Twitter. The company intends to start beta testing in North America this summer.', 'On the ground, however, SpaceX still has work to do. It has yet to unveil hardware to connect a customer’s home to the satellites flying overhead. The company will also need a network of ground stations linking its satellites to the internet’s physical backbone. Building these nodes is hardly rocket science: indeed 26 are already planned for the U.S. But without a crucial satellite upgrade, those stations will keep the network’s coverage stuck largely to the land.', '“It’s very much not initially a global service,” says Tim Farrar, the president of TMF Associates, a satellite and telecom research firm, “even though the satellites are flying all over the place.”', 'Efforts to beam data down from the skies have typically fallen into two categories: the very near and the very far. Google parent company Alphabet is deploying internet balloons about 12 miles above the ground in Kenya, for instance, and Facebook has its eye on solar-powered drones. These near-surface approaches are speedy, but each floating antenna has a limited geographic footprint.', 'In contrast, companies like the Canadian communications firm Telesat have long operated handfuls of satellites in high orbits more than 20,000 miles above Earth’s surface, where each machine can reach a wide swath of the planet. These systems offer global coverage, but snail-like connections, with round trip signals taking more than half a second. “That doesn’t sound like a big deal, but a typical web page might have 100 round trips,” says Telesat vice president Erwin Hudson. “It adds up.”', 'With Starlink, SpaceX joins a fray of companies, including Telesat, all racing to deliver the best of both worlds: “constellations” of satellites close enough to communicate with the ground in tens of milliseconds, but far enough to cover the planet with a reasonable number of satellites. To complete the service, however, SpaceX needs two more pieces of ground-based infrastructure.', 'Starlink’s major terrestrial hurdle, Musk acknowledges, is the antenna that will get users online — the internet analog of the TV parabolic dish. Starlink’s low-flying satellites zoom across the sky in about five minutes, and antennas will need to keep up. SpaceX’s design has to balance technological sophistication with mass-market affordability.', 'The company plans to use “phased array antennas,” which can direct the machine’s focus electronically rather than physically spinning it around. The technique simplifies the device mechanically, but comes at a high price. Farrar estimates that the gadget could cost more than $1,000, although Musk is targeting a price tag of under $300. In March, the FCC authorized SpaceX to distribute one million antennas, and SpaceX board members recently tested the devices (which reportedly resemble “UFOs on a stick”), but the company has not yet announced the retail version. ', 'Board member tweet', 'Any satellite service also needs a network of ground stations to tap into existing fiber optic infrastructure. These are the points where the space network fuses with the world wide web. “What goes up must come down,” Hudson said.', 'SpaceX is preparing these “gateway” stations, too. The company has registered 26 locations with the FCC, each of which can host eight antennas. Some are SpaceX-owned properties while others belong to telecommunications companies, such as Level Three Communications, which can presumably supply high-speed hookups. Handfuls of mushroom-shaped domes — radar transparent weather protection for antennas — have recently cropped up on some of the lots.', 'These gateways are just the beginning. For maximum performance, Starlink will eventually need thousands of gateway antennas (roughly one per satellite) spread across hundreds of sites worldwide, according to Íñigo del Portillo Barrios, a recent MIT graduate who has analyzed the structure of the Starlink and Telesat constellations.', 'He says Starlink relies heavily on these stations because the current batch of satellites lacks an originally planned feature for the machines to communicate with their neighbors via lasers. This “crosslinking” ability would let Starlink pass a signal to any user below any satellite — even those in the air, on remote islands, or in conflict zones. But without it, a satellite must be able to link a user with a gateway antenna directly, limiting coverage to within roughly 500 miles of each ground station, Farrar estimates.', '“They’ll have big holes in the middle of the oceans and some deserts,” Farrar said. “They’ll need to go to a country’s regulator and say, ‘please let us in, please let us build the gateways in your country.’”', 'That’s hardly a showstopper for reaching most rural areas (currently planned stations will cover most of the U.S. and Mexico). But traditional satellite internet clients such as the military, who might desire access over central Iraq for example, or airlines and shipping companies seeking connectivity in the Atlantic and Pacific, may prefer to wait for a truly global service.', 'SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment on its gateway or crosslinking plans, but Hudson says that even though Telesat has 50 years of satellite experience and plans to start launching crosslink-enabled satellites in 2022, choreographing ground operations will still represent one of their major challenges.', '“We’re building earth stations on every continent except possibly Antarctica,” he said. “You’ve got to ship stuff everywhere. You’ve got to get it built, maintained, and upgraded.”', 'Adding crosslinking will eventually help SpaceX lessen the sway geography has on Starlink’s coverage, and the company intends to start experimenting with interlinked satellites sometime this year, president Gwynne Shotwell has said.', 'But the upgrade won’t be simple, and the second-generation network won’t be operational in the immediate future. First SpaceX needs to overhaul its satellite design to incorporate a beefier power supply, finely tuned lasers, and other hardware. Then it will also have to rebuild and relaunch the entire swarm.', 'The company can pull it off eventually, Farrar said, but first Starlink will have to prove its worth with the satellites it has in the sky, and the gateway stations it can build on the ground.']"

', '  The Falcon 9 rocket carried a Japanese communications satellite  into space from the Florida launch site, detached its payload and  then landed on the ship.

Our success on other worlds will rest, in part, on the supple stems of plants.', '“Plants are things that we take with us as explorers,” says Anna-Lisa Paul, the co-director of the University of Florida Space Plants Lab. “They’re part of our core heritage whether we think of it or not.”', 'On all the brief forays into space so far, astronauts have sustained themselves almost entirely on packaged food. But if humans ever hope to set up long-term habitats on the moon or Mars, their physical and mental health would benefit from the ability to grow plants.', 'Space agencies from various countries have spent decades developing the technologies necessary to bring farming indoors, and now the German space agency and NASA are pushing the state-of-the-art of soil-free gardening to its limits with a greenhouse in Antarctica and laying the groundwork for their next act: farming systems where the farmers are optional.', 'NASA has worked to advance space agriculture, in part because a robust plant collection could serve as the ultimate multipurpose life-support system, producing calories and nutrients to eat, making oxygen to breathe and taking carbon dioxide from the air.', 'Building on Soviet research, NASA funded a variety of agricultural programs in the 1980s and 1990s. In a collaboration with the University of Wisconsin, researchers discovered that they could replace hot and cumbersome incandescent grow lights with a particular blend of LED lights. Red LEDs, which were more energy efficient, let plants photosynthesize. But plants also needed blue light, or they would grow too tall and spindly. The work led to a patent, and today’s indoor farms often feed plants on a similar diet of red and blue photons — which is why indoor farms often appear bathed in purple light.', '“NASA was genuinely in front of the curve on this, promoting their use for these applications,” says Raymond Wheeler, a horticultural scientist who has studied space agriculture at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for decades.', 'In the late 1980s, Wheeler worked on a KSC team that grew wheat, potatoes, soybeans and other crops with their roots immersed in a nutrient solution, stacked on four rows of shelves inside a large cylindrical chamber — likely the first execution of a vertical farming system that has now developed into a multi-billion-dollar industry.', 'Focusing on ways to sustainably meet the ever-growing demand for food, companies around indoor vertical farming has seen a boom in recent years. New York-based start-up Bowery Farming announced a $300 million funding round in June, the largest in the industry thus far, valuing the company at $2.3 billion. Kimbal Musk, brother of Elon Musk, is the co-founder of Square Roots. Newark-based AeroFarms in April broke ground on a 136,000-square-foot-farm in Virginia set to open in 2022 that it says will be the largest aeroponic indoor vertical farm in the world.', 'The German Aerospace Center (DLR) sent twin shipping containers to Antarctica in the fall of 2017 in what amounted to a remote dress rehearsal for raising crops on another world.', 'The EDEN-ISS Antarctic greenhouse, now entering its fourth growing season, continues to prove that you do not need fertile ground or even sunlight to produce vegetables. It builds upon the LED blend pioneered by the early NASA experiments to deliver “recipes” tuned to the needs of each specific vegetable with programmable arrays of red and blue lights.', 'Roots poke through beds of fibrous minerals and dangle into empty trays below, where automated nozzles spray them with a nutrient-rich mist every few seconds. Water is largely recycled, except when the nutrient solution gets depleted and needs to be dumped and replaced every few months. The entire system plugs into the neighboring German Neumeyer III research station, from which it continuously draws about 10 kilowatts of power — comparable to eight U.S. households.', 'The first year, a DLR researcher named Paul Zabel ran the 135-square-foot greenhouse and collected nearly 600 pounds of veggies including cucumbers, lettuces, other leafy greens, tomatoes, radishes and herbs.', 'But despite the greenhouse’s automated lighting, watering, and fertilizing systems, Zabel still spent three to four hours a day just keeping EDEN-ISS functioning, Schubert says. And in space, human labor will be just as precious a resource as water and air.', 'Having an AI system taking care of the greenhouse is preferred, according to Daniel Schubert, the project coordinator of the Antarctica experiment, “in the case that the astronauts just have no time.”', 'This year, NASA has sent one of their own researchers, Jess Bunchek, to test out the U.S. space agency’s preferred strains of space veggies in EDEN-ISS. Another major research goal will be to collect detailed data of what tasks take up the most time. Bunchek will carry an eight-sided programmable timer that she will use to track the hours she spends on eight categories of work.', 'One of the major time-sinks has been repairing breakdowns, or “off-nominal events” in the doublespeak of space exploration. A burst pipe, for instance, might take all day to fix. Topping the list of lessons learned from EDEN-ISS is that future facilities need to be simpler. “We will definitely scale down the technology complexity for a space greenhouse,” Schubert says.', 'Next in the pipeline, DLR is currently designing a new facility — a semi-inflatable, space-rated cylinder — with a few new tricks.', 'One improvement will be advanced remote monitoring. Anna-Lisa Paul and her colleagues at the UF Space Plants Lab are developing software that can take GoPro images and recognize how a plant’s appearance changes with stress. When a plant needs water or has been exposed to too much salt, the colors of light it absorbs and reflects shift subtly in ways imperceptible to the human eye. But the lab’s system can spot salt stress in just fifteen minutes, and drought stress in about an hour, according to Natasha Sng, a researcher at the Space Plants Lab, much earlier than a human can.', 'The researchers have been testing their system at EDEN-ISS, but the greenhouse has been running too smoothly to know how well the monitoring system works. “We’ve been watching a lot of success happen,” says Robert Ferl, co-director of the Space Plants Lab.', 'Soon, the researchers plan to introduce intentional malfunctions and see if the lab’s system can catch them.', 'In another major step toward automation, the DLR is developing robotic arms to be mounted on a rail suspended from the greenhouse roof. These dexterous machines, powered by AI, would photograph the plants from various angles, prune dead leaves and shoots, and even harvest produce, which Schubert estimates are the most time-consuming activities after repairs.', 'The end goal is a greenhouse that, if not completely autonomous, could at least be run fully by operators on Earth. Such a facility could touch down on the moon or Mars ahead of astronauts and have a basket of cucumbers and tomatoes ready for their arrival. Astronauts would have the option of gardening, which can bolster mental health, but the crops should be able to thrive on their own when astronauts have more pressing tasks.', 'The DLR’s roadmap aims to have their next-generation facility ready to fly by 2030. “I still need to send [Elon] Musk an email and ask if we can design his greenhouse,” Schubert said.', 'And developing the ability to farm in space isn’t purely about going to Mars. A two-way street has always connected space agriculture with industrial agriculture. As climate change makes many areas of the globe less suitable for farming, the technology to split food production from weather and natural resources will likely become more essential.', '“My dream would be that we all live in ecological biospheres on our own,” Schubert says. “We would be completely independent from the planet Earth, and we would leave Earth to its own so it can recover.”']"

Taken at his word — which he has earned — that he won’t do a share repurchase just to prop up the stock, the big buyback was a signal from Buffett that he thinks the stock is undervalued.', '“If he had acquired a portfolio company for $18 billion or purchased $18 billion in the stock of a public company, we would call it significant,” said James Shanahan, Edward Jones analyst, who estimated the buybacks through Oct. at $18.4 billion and maintains a positive outlook on Berkshire shares.', '“Few better places for Berkshire to allocate its capital than to investing in itself with share buybacks,” says Lawrence Cunningham, author of several books about Warren Buffett and Berkshire, and a professor at George Washington University. “Price was right. Disclosure was clear. Pure investment rationality.”', 'Even if Buffett is making the right call on the buybacks, the size of it being bigger than any M&A acquisition since 2016′s deal for Precision Castparts highlights a reason Berkshire has struggled to keep up with the broader market in recent years: investors don’t see Buffett being able to make the bold bets that made his name and so many Berkshire shareholders’ fortunes.', 'Over the past two decades, Buffett has done reasonably well against the index, actually beating the S&P 500 in 12 calendar years between 1999 and 2020. Though years in which Berkshire has trailed have included some big margins and resulted in the company lagging the index over the past 5-, 10- and 15-year periods, according to data from S&P Global.', 'In 2020, Berkshire Hathaway shares were up, but not by much (2%), against an S&P 500 that gained over 18%, with dividends reinvested, according to S&P Global. Taken together, the two-year stretch of 2019 and 2020 marked one of the biggest gaps between Berkshire and the broader U.S. stock market in recent history, with the Buffett trailing the index return by a combined 37%.', 'At least in the short-term, investor sentiment is against the company because market forces are working against him. The market Buffett faces is defined by record low interest rates — which the Fed has signalled will remain the norm for some time — making more cheap debt available to fund acquisitions from competitors, such as private equity, that don’t now need the cash reserves of a Berkshire. As a result, asset prices across the market are elevated.', '“No one is contesting his multi-decade track record, the intelligent use of cheap flows to build tremendous value over time. He has done that repeatedly, but now capital is cheap for everyone,” says Meyer Shields, a KBW analyst. “It diminishes his advantage. It was an element of the secret sauce, but maybe the best of bad choices is to not buy anything.”', 'Shields, who has covered Berkshire Hathaway for a long time, often critically, and has had the distinction of being excluded from analyst invitations to the company’s annual meetings, says Buffett can be right about not overpaying and still be punished by investors for that decision. “It mostly comes down to valuation for acquisition opportunities and barring some crash, I don’t see tremendous opportunities for acquisitions going forward. We are stuck with the idea that they have a ton of capital, but so does everyone.”', 'Between the pandemic onset and through the May virtual annual meeting — where Charlie Munger was notably replaced by Berkshire Hathaway Energy head Greg Abel as Buffett’s counterpart, which will be the case again this year as speculation centers on Abel as the first post-Buffett CEO — frustration with the pace of investment activity grew. Buffett was uncharacteristically fearful when others were fearful, too.', '“It was fair for them to be concerned about the implications of the pandemic. But people were nervous because they didn’t see opportunities ... and they didn’t see attractive stocks to buy, and weren’t even buying back their own stock, just hoarding cash and people worried about what he would do with it,” Shanahan said.', 'In March, no one had a handle on what mortality rates from the pandemic would be, or how the government would act, and Berkshire’s long-term history shows that Buffett holds cash during periods of risk. “There might have been some disappointment, but he was being consistent,” Shields said, even when it came to not rushing to buy back Berkshire shares.', 'The distressed investments Buffett was able to make in the last financial crisis of 2008, meanwhile, were not repeatable during the pandemic, as the government acted rapidly to stimulate the economy and support devastated industries.', '“This time around government support was swift, rolled out so much faster than in 2008,” Shanahan said.', 'The one investment that ultimately helped to boost investors confidence starting in the summer was the increased buyback activity being disclosed. “They got aggressive with the buybacks from June through October. There is not as much competition to buy back his own stock,” Shanahan said.', 'Cunningham expects more of the same: “Added bonus: get rid of the short-term Berkshire shareholders, such as Bill Ackman, in favor of the true believers. ... expect continued repetition.”', 'The $145 billion last reported in cash by Berkshire does need to move to keep the stock moving higher.', '“The worst thing that can happen is they aren’t deploying capital. I would like to see much more cash put to work. It is a huge driver of earnings and market cap,” said Shanahan. “But there are very few acquisitions over $20 billion. ... Capital deployment in excess of cash generation will drive the stock and the easiest way to accomplish that is buybacks.”', 'Precision Castparts, in 2016, was a $37 billion deal.', 'In recent years Buffett has made clear that assets are so pricey, his preference is to focus on buying more stocks of public companies. But that had the unintended consequence of making some of his smaller missteps with those public stock holdings more notable in 2020.', 'Berkshire sold the big stake it had recently built in airline stocks including American, Delta, United and Southwest, early in Q2 2020, possibly near trough valuations. And through the end of the second quarter, Berkshire was a net seller of stocks. Its reduced holdings of financial stocks, including investments in Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, PNC, M&T Bank and Bank of NY Mellon — which in the broader scheme of things should attract more investors as the public stock portfolio tilts more to tech and consumer trends — did include some questionable timing decisions.', '“The airline stocks was messy,. He certainly sold at a bad time and was liquidating bank stocks at cheap valuations. JP Morgan has rallied a lot,” said Shanahan. “Those were timing mistakes. With the airlines it was the right thing to do, but the wrong time to do it.”', 'Buffett has been loading up on Bank of America as his No. 1 bank stock for the future. “Bank of America has been a homerun,” Shanahan said of the investment agreement first reached in 2011 when Berkshire bought $5 billion in bank preferred shares and the right to 700 million in common shares over a decade at a price of roughly $7 per share, which currently trades above $30.', '“Getting rid of some of the financials was my biggest frustration,” said Greg Womack, president of Womack Investment Advisers, which has held Berkshire as a core portfolio stock across many client accounts. “The timing hasn’t always been the best ... but I don’t think they look so much at the technicals.”', 'With more of the investment decision-making being in the hands of hedge fund managers brought in-house years ago,Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, the timing decisions could change more in the future, analysts and investors say. The recent past has seen a significant shift in the stock portfolio managed by Berkshire.', 'At the end of 2018, the portfolio was still “handcuffed by financials,” Shanahan said.', 'Even with Apple as its largest stock holding — which has proved to be a great investment in tech by Buffett after his IBM stumble and has grown so much Berkshire was led to trim the position last year — Berkshire’s internal managers who have discretion to buy in the billions of dollars have been underweight technology, and that is one reason it has trailed the S&P 500.', '“These portfolio managers charged with trying to outperform the market didn’t own stocks in the sector that was the strongest performing,” Shanahan said. “Financials like Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank sort of set them up to underperform into 2019 and 2020. It is a hard thing to do, hard to beat the market, when you have large percentages in value stocks. They took action.”', 'Since the end of 2018, Berkshire’s stock portfolio exposure to financials has fallen from 49% to 28%, while tech has swelled, primarily due to Apple. Technology and consumer stocks are now close to 50% of the public company holdings. Stocks that have appeared in recent years include Amazon, T-Mobile and, in the most recent quarter, a handful of health-care stocks.', '“Tech, communication services, health care. It is starting to have more of a new economy feel and look more like the market,” Shanahan said. In the Sept. 2020 quarter alone, Berkshire disclosed $7 billion in new positions in tech, communications and health care sectors. Health-care stock Davita is a major Berkshire holding, but the company has not historically invested much in health care sector relative to other sectors.', 'The most surprising new portfolio direction was Berkshire’s first-ever U.S. IPO investment, Snowflake, which turned out to be the biggest tech software IPO in history.', '“Tech investments Buffett didn’t used to think he understood. The industry is easier to understand now, and unavoidable,” Cunningham said. “But those companies [Apple, Snowflake] are still very much Berkshire kinds of companies, led by long-term strategic thinkers who want to have high quality shareholders.”', 'Snowflake may have been in investment led by Todd Combs, who Shanahan noted has signed the paperwork on the deal and was also behind Berkshire Hathaway’s investment in Brazilian credit-card-processing company Stoneco, which was made just days after the IPO in late 2018.', 'A very Buffett-like deal in support of Scripps’ acquisition of ION Media, was led by the other manager Ted Weschler, through which Berkshire invested $600 million in preferred stock (8% dividend if paid in cash, 9% if deferred).', 'With prices high in the U.S. market, Berkshire bought slightly more than 5% stakes in Japanese conglomerates Itochu, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo & Marubeni, driven by frustration with the lack of opportunities in the U.S., according to Shanahan. And Berkshire issued yen-denominated bonds at an all-in cost of about 1% to finance the transaction. “Highly unusual, though. Berkshire hasn’t made a lot of large investments in international stocks in the past,” he said, adding that the transactions can be increased to near-10%.', 'Buffett also ended his remaining ownership within the newspaper business in 2020 and while not surprising, it was notable in light of Buffett’s longer history of never selling companies he acquires, and could also be a signal to the next era of Berkshire management post-Buffett that some philosophies are allowed to change.', '“They are doing IPOs and selling operating companies, which they wouldn’t do in the past, and making investments in international stocks, and willing to buy back shares at an accelerated pace. Quite a bit has changed,” Shanahan said.', 'For first time, Berkshire also invested in gold — a commodity Buffett has long criticized — though it bought gold mining stock Barrick Gold rather than the metal directly. Nevertheless, the market saw the move as a significant reversal as gold miners are levered to the underlying price of the metal.', '“It looks like they are building a little bit of a hedge there,” says Womack. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they add to that position.”', 'The big changes to the stock portfolio may hold one more big surprise in 2021. Berkshire recently disclosed that confidential information had been omitted from its 13F report, which details the latest stock buying and selling. In the past, this has meant that Berkshire was building a large position in a public company and wanted regulatory permission to complete their purchases prior to making the information public.', 'Shanahan noted that the value of the equity portfolio was $245 billion as of Sept. 30, 2020, excluding Kraft Heinz, and he could only account for roughly $220 billion. Some of that difference could be related to more shares in the Japanese trading firms being purchased, but this is a strategy Berkshire has used in the past when building a big position in a company, such as IBM, and there are other options even in a pricey U.S. market, such as in the depressed energy sector, though Berkshire has been a seller of some energy stocks in recent history.', 'Berkshire’s existing operating companies have potential in the near-term without a major new position. Berkshire Energy, in particular, should have faster growth than many other subsidiaries as electricity demand grows, and many of the other wholly owned businesses negatively influenced by Covid, from reduced shipping to higher insurance claims and restaurant shutdowns and retail store closures, hurting Brooks and other retail brands under the Berkshire umbrella, could see improved earnings in 2021, even though Shanahan said he thought insurer Geico and railroad Burlington Northern held up well in 2020.', 'Buffett may yet get his opportunity to make some major moves with his company’s cash. “We will still see a lot of companies in financial trouble over the next few years when they go to refinance debt and they are already over-leveraged.

The stock closed the day down 4.6%. ', 'McCarthy, a former Netflix and Spotify executive, has been candid in recent press interviews about what he viewed as an opportunity at Peloton to cut hardware costs.

In Canada, the fee will rise to $55 per month, from $49. Pricing for international members will remain unchanged, Peloton said. The cost of a digital-only membership, for people who don’t own any of Peloton’s equipment, will still be $12.99 a month.', 'Peloton explained the decision in a company blog post shared with CNBC. “There’s a cost to creating exceptional content and an engaging platform,” the company said.

Earlier this month, it began selling its new strength product, Peloton Guide, for $295. That’s $200 less than what Peloton last November said the device, bundled with a heart rate armband, would retail for.', 'In recent weeks, Peloton’s stock has been trading below $29, where it priced at its initial public offering in 2019, also putting it back at pre-pandemic levels. Shares have fallen almost 35% since the day McCarthy was announced as CEO.', 'McCarthy took over in early February as CEO from Peloton’s founder, John Foley, who is now serving as executive chairman.', 'At the time, Peloton also announced plans to cut about 2,800 jobs across its business and get rid of hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual expenses, as part of a massive restructuring and operational reset.', 'Still, there are concerns that McCarthy, who says he still works closely with Foley, isn’t doing enough to get back to profitability.', 'On Wednesday, activist Blackwells Capital reiterated its call for Peloton to consider a sale of the company, arguing in a presentation that shareholders in the business are worse off now than they were before McCarthy took over. Peloton didn’t comment.', 'What Blackwells and other analysts can agree on, however, is that Peloton has built a loyal base of subscribers who have invested in the company’s workout equipment and continue to pay the monthly fee for content to go along with it.

The lower the churn rate, the better news for Peloton.', 'As of Dec. 31, Peloton’s connected fitness subscribers were also averaging 15.5 workouts each month.', 'Peloton continues to roll out new types of classes, from yoga to meditation to kickboxing, in a bid to give its members more for their money.']"
132,"Michael Flynn, Russia and a grand scheme to build nuclear power plants in Saudi Arabia and the Arab world",2017-06-09T22:05:15+0000,"['By the time Michael Flynn was fired as President Donald Trump’s national security adviser in February, he had made a lot of bad decisions. One was taking money from the Russians (and failing to disclose it); another was taking money under the table from the Turks. But an overlooked line in his financial disclosure form, which he was forced to amend to detail those foreign payments, reveals he was also involved in one of the most audacious—and some say harebrained—schemes in recent memory: a plan to build scores of U.S. nuclear power plants in the Middle East. As a safety measure.', 'In 2015 and 2016, according to his filing, Flynn was an adviser to X-Co Dynamics Inc./Iron Bridge Group, which at first glance looks like just another Pentagon consultancy that ex-military officers use to fatten their wallets. Its chairman and CEO was retired Admiral Michael Hewitt; another retired admiral, Frank “Skip” Bowman, who oversaw the Navy’s nuclear programs, was an adviser. Other top guns associated with it were former National Security Agency boss Keith Alexander and retired Marine Corps General James “Hoss” Cartwright, former vice chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, whose stellar career was marred when he was prosecuted last year for lying to the FBI during a leak investigation.', 'In the summer of 2015, knowledgeable sources tell Newsweek, Flynn flew to Egypt and Israel on behalf of X-Co/Iron Bridge. His mission: to gauge attitudes in Cairo and Jerusalem toward a fantastical plan for a joint U.S.-Russian (and Saudi-financed) program to get control over the Arab world’s rush to acquire nuclear power. At the core of their concern was a fear that states in the volatile Middle East would have inadequate security for the plants and safeguards for their radioactive waste—the stuff of nuclear bombs.', 'More from Newsweek: How Big Data mines personal info to craft fake news and manipulate votersWhat will happen to Trump?‘Infrastructure week’ symbol of Trump’s many problems', 'But no less a concern for Flynn and his partners was the moribund U.S. nuclear industry, which was losing out to Russian and even South Korean contractors in the region. Or as Stuart Solomon, a top executive along with Hewitt at his new venture, IP3 (International Peace, Power and Prosperity), put it in a recent speech to industry executives, “We find ourselves…standing on the sidelines and watching the competition pass us by.”', 'That the oil-rich, sun-soaked Arab Middle East would pursue nuclear energy seems paradoxical. But as The Economist noted in 2015, “Demand for electricity is rising, along with pressure to lower carbon emissions; nuclear plants tick both boxes.” And some of the region’s major players, like Egypt and Jordan, don’t have oil and gas resources and “want nuclear power to shore up the security of their energy supplies,” The Economist said.', 'So the genius idea developed by Flynn and Co. was a U.S.-Russian partnership to build and operate plants and export the dangerous spent fuel under strict controls. Flynn’s role would be helping X-Co/Iron Bridge design and implement a vast security network for the entire enterprise, according to an internal memo by ACU Strategic Partners, one of the lead companies involved, obtained by Newsweek.', 'Not only would the project revive the U.S. nuclear industry, but it would cost American taxpayers nothing, its principals asserted. It would be “funded entirely by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries,” according to the ACU memo. The kingdom’s upfront cost? “Close to a trillion dollars,” says a project insider, who asked for anonymity in exchange for discussing internal matters. Theoretically, the Saudis would recoup their costs by selling energy to Egypt, Jordan, Yemen and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar—which hosts the largest U.S. military base in the region. (Qatar doesn’t seem to be an option for the moment, since six of the Arab states, led by the Saudis, severed diplomatic relations with it on June 5 over its alleged support of terrorism.)', 'Left out of this grand nuclear scheme: Iran (along with Syria, its war-ravaged Shiite proxy). In fact, “it was always part of the project that Russia’s involvement...would tilt Russia away from Iran,” Fred Johnson, ACU’s chief economist, wrote in an email to his advisers obtained by Newsweek. Not only would Russia earn cash for being a dumping ground for radioactive waste, Johnson wrote, but the consortium would purchase “Russian military hardware” to compensate Moscow for losing military sales to Iran.', '“Further plans to sideline Iran,” Johnson wrote, included “the development of X-Co,” the Hewitt company that Flynn was advising, “with its very visible deployment of Sea Launch,” a Russian company “that would provide a platform for rockets.”', 'It’s unclear whether Flynn was involved in negotiating with Sea Launch. The former general, now being pursued by federal investigators probing contacts between Russian officials and Trump’s inner circle, did not respond to an inquiry from Newsweek. People associated with the Middle East project say they thought Flynn’s involvement was limited to sounding out the Egyptians and Israelis on security aspects of the enterprise. He listed no income from X-Co/Iron Bridge on his financial disclosure form and “was not paid,” except for his travel expenses, according to Thomas Cochran, a prominent scientist and nuclear nonproliferation proponent involved with the project. (The cost of business-class round-trip airfare and exclusive hotels for the trip would have ranged between $10,000 and $15,000.)', 'Hewitt denied that isolating Iran was part of the plan. “X-Co wasn’t created to simply ‘sideline Iran,’” he responded to Johnson and their associates in an email. “It was designed to set the conditions for stability which were the precursors to building 40 plants” and to “solidify the GCC, Jordan, Egypt under a security construct, led by two superpowers, using state of the art capability.”', 'But the project faced opposition from the Obama administration, Cochran says. “They didn’t want to do it with the Russians and didn’t want to do it while they were negotiating the Iran deal,” he tells Newsweek.', 'Trump’s embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin, on the other hand, offered an attractive possibility. And when Flynn, who had connections to the Russians, became the candidate’s national security adviser, the ACU team, led by British-American dealmaker Alex Copson, suddenly seemed to have an inside man. Last year, Copson was touting such connections when he tried to buy an unfinished nuclear plant in Alabama in concert with the Russians, telling a Huntsville reporter that “Alabama’s two senators”—both Republicans, and one, Jeff Sessions, then a top Trump campaign adviser—“can help the next administration move this project forward.” Copson’s bid for the plant failed.', 'When reports surfaced that the FBI was investigating possible collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign, however, some of Copson’s partners and advisers decided it was time to walk away. “When Copson decided he was going to saddle up with the Trump team, that was the last straw for me,” the insider says. “I said it’s time to regroup.”', 'The Saudis hadn’t shown much interest anyway, the insider says. “Copson was promising the advisers lots of money if the Saudis put up money,” but it failed to materialize. “And so there’s nothing that anyone was going to gain unless the project was a success,” he tells Newsweek.', 'Hewitt and his associates also split from ACU to pursue their own path toward a nuclear-powered Middle East, one that would swap in China for Russia as a nuclear partner, two sources close to the project say. (Hewitt declined to discuss plans for IP3, telling Newsweek he was “working hard to create our public persona right now.”)', 'But the highly regarded Cochran stayed with ACU. A longtime senior scientist and onetime president at the Natural Resources Defense Council, he was the author of countless studies and articles over the decades and had initiated with Moscow the U.S.-Soviet nuclear test ban verification project in 1986. He “has extraordinary chutzpah,” a writer for Scientific American observed in 1998. “He is willing to take on what most people wouldn’t bother with because they assume it’s hopeless.”', 'Or nuts. In 2001, a writer for the left-wing In These Times weekly got hold of a draft proposal for a 1990s-era project that Cochran was involved in, the Nuclear Proliferation Trust, which envisioned taking control of spent fuel from reactors around the world and shipping it to Russia “on large ships mounted with an arsenal of weapons designed to ward off nuclear pirates,” wrote Jeffrey St. Clair. “The big question is what happens to the waste after it arrives in Russia.” Would NPT guards be authorized to fire on rogue Russian soldiers or Chechen rebels? And what would stop corrupt Russians from selling weapons-grade uranium to anyone who could pony up the cash?', 'Similar concerns are all the more reason to partner with the Russians today in an ironclad security arrangement, Hewitt says. “We’re always going to be engaged in the security of the Middle East,” he told a May gathering at the Nuclear Energy Institute. “It is in our best interests to ensure that nuclear power is introduced with all of the safety [standards of the U.S.].”', 'Cochran urges critics not to lose focus on the big picture, which he alternately likens to launching the U.S. Marshall Plan, which rebuilt Europe after World War II, and the Tennessee Valley Authority, which tamed rivers and brought electricity and industrial development to the American South in the 1930s. “It would provide energy and jobs and so forth for countries like Egypt and others in the region,” he says, “so that these young men have got something more useful to do than go out and shoot each other.”', 'For a project fraught with such diplomatic and logistical minefields, however, Copson is an odd choice to lead ACU into the Middle East. “A sometime bass player with the British rock band Iron Butterfly,” according to Time, Copson once famously “described the natives of the Marshall Islands as ‘fat, lazy fucks’ when they nixed one of his nuke dump schemes” in the Central Pacific Ocean, the muckraking journalist Greg Palast wrote in 2001. (The islands are now disappearing under rising seas.)', 'Copson did not respond to several calls and emails asking for comment. But it’s not likely the Trump team, many of whom are under close scrutiny for their undisclosed Russian contacts, will be any help to Copson now. And the Saudis aren’t “taking the kind of steps that would be required to really get serious about setting up a civil nuclear-energy infrastructure,” says Tristan Volpe, a fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C.', 'Others suspect the Saudis are up to something more nefarious because of the U.S.-led nuclear deal with Iran. The Saudis “have big ambitions for nuclear,” says David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, D.C. “The issue is whether they cross over into any processing or enrichment” with secret partners like Pakistan or China, he says.', 'Flynn once expressed deep worries about a Saudi-Iranian nuclear arms race. In a January 2016 interview with Al-Jazeera, he sounded like Cochran, the elder statesman of the nonproliferation movement. “An entirely new economy is what this region needs,” he said, especially for the millions of unemployed young men living under corrupt autocracies and tempted by extremism. “You’ve got to give them something else to do. If you don’t, they’re going to turn on their own governments.”', 'But that was before he hitched up with Trump, who has embraced the Saudi monarchy and ratcheted up his rhetoric against Iran. Talk of a grand scheme to create jobs in the Middle East, meanwhile, has evaporated, with the Russia scandal enveloping not only Flynn but Trump’s entire presidency.', 'Watch: Flynn misled investigators', 'This piece originally appeared on Newsweek.']"

JL Precision and these suppliers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.', 'There were also racks of castings, used to make tooling for Tesla’s own manufacturing operation.', 'Once the “non-conforming” parts are analyzed and fixed, they can be used either for spare parts or in final vehicle assembly. Outsourcing some rework allows Tesla to avoid wasting materials they’ve paid for already and frees up space in its Fremont factory, where all of its electric vehicles are now produced.', 'Auto-manufacturing expert Steve Finch, a former GM plant manager with about 40 years of industry experience, said automakers typically deal with some flawed parts from suppliers.', 'Finch said mass-market car companies normally will take a year or more to vet a prospective supplier. This is to ensure the supplier’s factory follows ISO quality management standards and other processes that are on par with the automaker’s own.', 'Former and current employees said Tesla took less time before signing on new suppliers. Tesla employees tasked with vetting suppliers were also not always experienced with ISO quality management standards, said these people.', 'Finch said outsourcing some rework to outside suppliers is “not an unreasonable thing,” however, automakers “will want to avoid having to make decisions that are hugely expensive or could delay production.”', 'He added automakers usually try to make sure their parts suppliers “are able to make quality parts not just one time but every time well ahead of the start of vehicle production.”', 'Hanging on to flawed parts from vendors and reworking them locally makes sense when an automaker is constrained by supply or time, Finch said. Sending rework off-site to shops near a factory can help a car company avoid the wait and cost associated with overseas shipping.

Tesla typically ramps up production at the end of each quarter, with all hands working overtime to make the numbers.

Vostok Oil is expected to produce up to 100 million tons of oil per year, or a fifth of what Russia currently pumps, Reuters noted.', 'But the Arctic is more significant to Russia for more than resources and it has an important economic, defensive and transport value too. It has symbolic and nationalistic value, Østhagen said.', '“The name of the game in the Arctic is presence,” he said, noting that the region had value for Russian President Vladimir Putin who has overseen a rise in Russian nationalist sentiment during his two decades in power.', 'But that drive to magnify Russia’s status on the world stage has competed with its sluggish economy in the last five years, following a slump in oil prices on which it largely relies in terms of export revenues. Russia’s changing economic fortunes were reflected in its spending plans for the Arctic region, in which it had planned super-projects as part of an “Arctic Program” of investment and development.', 'In 2017, RBC news agency reported that funding for the program had been slashed severely: the Ministry of Economic Development had wanted 209 billion rubles for the new national Arctic Program, funding that would take it up to 2020, but was expected to get only 12 billion ruble.', 'There are signs of recovery now, however, and the economy is expected to grow 1.2% in 2019; 1.6% in 2020; and 1.8% in 2021, the World Bank forecast earlier in December. Experts agree that the cost-benefit analysis of Arctic expansion, a region whose hostile environment quickly increases operational costs, needs to be carefully assessed.', '“Arctic development is indeed costly for Russia, but the government deems it necessary, and legitimate, to perform ‘great power status’ across this new frontier, as well as to anticipate the negative impact of climate change for coastal regions in the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation,” Mathieu Boulegue, a research fellow at the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House, told CNBC. ', '“Civilian investment, however, has been tremendously slashed since 2017, with few prospects to increase again for the time being,” he noted.', 'In 2017, Russian military spending fell by a fifth marking its first decline in nearly two decades and data from 2019 showed Russia was no longer in the top five global military spenders, just as the U.S. and China have increased spending.', 'Martina Bozadzhieva, managing director of research at consultancy firm DuckerFrontier, told CNBC that defense spending was continuing to decline in Russia, with money being redirected toward other pressing domestic issues.', '″(There is now) the focus on the domestic economy, income standards, and what you’ve seen over the last couple of years is that there was a big spike in military spending, some of which went towards a range of strategies including the Arctic. But that military spending growth is being wound down to free up money for salaries, pensions etc,” she said.', '“That money is being redirected. So it’s not to say that Russia is trying to pull back from the Arctic, it’s more that the funding is being restructured.”', 'One of the projects that combines economic and symbolic importance for Russia is the Northeast Passage or Northern Sea Route (NSR), a once inaccessible shipping route in the Russian Arctic that, as ice sheets melt, Russia sees as a future shipping super highway to transport goods and resources between Asia and Europe. It hopes the route could rival the traditional Europe-Asia sea route, via the Suez Canal, as it shortens the shipping duration by around 15 days.', 'The Arctic institute’s Andreas Østhagen noted that the NSR fulfilled both an economic and symbolic need for Russia to assert itself in the Arctic (the NSR runs along the entirety of its territorial waters, from the Bering Strait between Siberia and Alaska to the Barents Sea, near Norway) but that it might be too early for Russia to reap the economic benefits yet, given the hostile environment for much of the year and the need for more maritime infrastructure.', '“The route has symbolic and nationalistic connotations — just for Russia to be present and to develop the sea route and its military capabilities there, but also the economic benefits, although it’s questionable how large these will be,” he said, noting it would be costly for companies to operate there, particularly with the need for ice breakers for most of the year.', '“We could see increased destinational traffic there, like services for the Yamal LNG superplant, or tourism traffic with cruise ship vessels. But it won’t be that lucrative, it won’t have the volume of shipments like the Suez or Panama Canal,” Østhagen said.', 'Aside from Russia’s commercial development of the Arctic, another pressing issue in the region, and a concern for the western military alliance NATO, is the perception that the area is becoming an increasingly militarized space, opening up a new, literally cold front in already frosty relations between Russia and the West.', 'In recent years, Russia has advanced its military capabilities in the Arctic, reopening old military bases that had been abandoned following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and bolstering the Russian Navy’s prestigious Northern Fleet that oversees operations and defense in the region.', 'The Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command was created in 2014 as Russia’s fifth military district, reflecting the Kremlin’s push to give defense in the region more weight; Putin announced that same year that Russia would build a unified network of Arctic defense infrastructure and improve the fleet’s warships and submarines.', 'The Northern Fleet and military exercises in the Arctic were a key part of Russia’s massive annual military drills, called Tsentr 2019, this year too. ', '“Russia has been consistently incorporating the Arctic in military thinking for less than a decade and therefore training, procuring and learning to survive, move, and fight in this extreme environment. Furthermore, a lot of effort has been put into deploying Arctic-capable air defense and sea denial systems,” Chatham House’s Boulegue told CNBC.', 'NATO has been increasingly concerned about what it sees as Russia’s militarization of the Arctic and it has been warned that it must increase its own presence to counter what some see as Russian aggression. DuckerFrontier’s Martina Bozadzhieva told CNBC that the Arctic was one area where Russia had an advantage, given its geography.', '“They (Russia) have been trying to double-down in areas they can really dominate, just because relative to NATO defense spending, Russia is actually not spending that much. So where they do have a natural advantage, as they do in the Arctic, they will be looking to press that advantage,” Bozadzhieva told CNBC. Boulegue and Østhagen believe that Russia is looking to avoid conflict in the Arctic, however.', 'Østhagen said military advances in the Arctic could on the one hand be seen as for domestic, defensive purposes or as potentially aggressive, but, he noted, “Russia would not have any interest in claiming any territory, but what you see beyond this is a focus on the Arctic strategically, as well as from China and the U.S., which brings the region into a geopolitical and geostrategic competition between these actors.”', 'With the Arctic offering apparently abundant resources, albeit difficult and expensive to extract, it’s no surprise that other Arctic nations (there are eight in all: Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia, and the U.S.) are also interested in developing their Arctic infrastructure and resources within their own territories too.', 'It’s just that Russia’s Arctic infrastructure happens to be more developed as it has more long-standing cities (like Murmansk and Norilsk), communities and investment there, experts note.', 'Despite varying degrees of competition and military tensions in the Arctic region, there are attempts at coordination and cooperation between Arctic states too, although at times somewhat reluctantly.', 'Dialog between Arctic states is frequent, for example; an International Arctic Forum was held in Russia in April with the summit dedicated to discussing the “socioeconomic development of Arctic regions and for developing multi-level, multilateral mechanisms for joint discovery and effective exploitation of the Arctic’s rich natural resource potential.”', 'Then in May, the Arctic Council (an intergovernmental forum to provide a means for promoting cooperation, coordination and interaction among the Arctic States) met in Finland. True to recent form, a joint declaration of intent from the council members was reportedly canceled because of the U.S.′ refusal to sign a declaration — aimed at balancing environmental protection in the Arctic with the development of its mineral wealth — because it referenced climate change as a serious threat.', 'Aside from tensions over environmental challenges and defense, several Arctic states (but particularly the U.S.), are worried about the ambitions and intentions of a non-Arctic state increasingly involved in the region: China.', 'China published its own Arctic Strategy in January 2018, laying out its interest in the region and it has been increasingly investing in Arctic infrastructure and energy projects, like the aforementioned Yamal LNG project in which its Silk Road Fund (a state-owned investment project) has a 9.9% stake, making it the largest foreign shareholder in the project.', ' Putin has welcomed Chinese investment, inviting the People’s Republic in late 2017 to help create an “Ice Silk Road,” or Polar Silk Road; essentially, another strand of China’s mega economic development project, the Belt and Road Initiative.', 'China has also invested in research stations in Iceland and Norway, and said it will collaborate with Russia on a research center to predict ice conditions along the Northern Sea Route and last year launched its first polar research ship, the icebreaker, Xuelong (or Snow Dragon) 2, that can break through 1.5 meters of ice. Like Russia, it is now building a nuclear-powered icebreaker; Russia launched its own, the Ural, in May.', 'The icebreaker will be one of a trio that will be managed by Russia’s state-owned nuclear energy corporation Rosatom, Reuters reported. The Ural and its sister ships are “central to our strategic project of opening the Northern Sea Route to all-year activity,” Alexey Likhachev, Rosatom’s chief executive, was quoted as saying. ', 'Russia and China have strengthened their geopolitical ties in a variety of areas in recent years and no less so than in the Arctic where both want to take commercial advantage of the Northern Sea Route. But China’s increasing activities in the region are alarming to the U.S. In May, the Pentagon released a report saying deepening Chinese activities in the Arctic region could pave the way for increased military activity there.', 'At the Arctic Council in May, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized China’s claim to being a “near-Arctic” state, saying that entitled it to “exactly nothing” in the region.']"
140,The two main sticking points behind Trump’s push to build more cars in the US,2017-01-24T19:25:53+0000,"['  President Donald Trump is hitting the gas on his bid to have more vehicles built in the U.S.', '  Ahead of Tuesday’s meeting with the CEOs of General  Motors, Ford and Fiat  Chrysler, Trump tweeted that he wants “new plants to be built here for cars sold here!”', '  He reiterated that determination during the morning’s meeting, promising to make it more economical for automakers to build vehicles in the U.S.', 'As the president puts pressure on automakers to bring jobs back to the U.S., here are two numbers that are likely gnawing at him.', '  Last year, Americans bought 17.55 million new vehicles — and  43 percent of them were imported. That’s more than 7.5 million  cars, trucks, SUVs and minivans coming in from around the world.   ', '  The two biggest countries shipping vehicles to the U.S. were  Mexico, at 11 percent, and Canada, at 10 percent. Detroit’s Big  Three automakers alone brought in 2.25 million vehicles that were  eventually sold to Americans.  ', '  Trump has repeatedly said that automakers can — and  should — be building those vehicles in the U.S. On Tuesday,  he told GM’s Mary Barra, Ford’s Mark Fields and  Fiat Chrysler’s Sergio Marchionne that he would make operating  in the U.S. more attractive for them, by cutting regulations and  taxes.', '“We just had a great conversation with the president, and he is  very focused on the policies that will grow investment, jobs,  here in America and American industry and of course in the  automotive industry,” Fields said after the meeting.', 'Still, don’t expect auto CEOs to immediately announce  multibillion-dollar investments to bring production back from  Mexico. That’s because the cost of building a vehicle there is  far cheaper.  ', '  Take the Ford Fusion, a midsize sedan the automaker builds in  Mexico. The Center for Automotive Research estimates Ford can  manufacture that car for approximately $1,200 less in Mexico than  in the U.S.', '  Of course, the economics could change if Trump moves forward with  plans to tax imports by 35 percent.', '  When the U.S. auto industry almost collapsed in 2009, the Big  Three automakers cut hundreds of thousands of jobs and closed  several assembly plants. By June 2009, U.S. auto manufacturing  jobs bottomed out at 623,500, according the U.S. Department of  Labor. ', '  Since then, as demand has rebounded, automakers and suppliers  have hired more than 300,000 workers. That’s welcome news in  states like Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, where the auto industry  supplies hundreds of thousands of jobs. Still, the number of people working in the industry is well below the 1.1 million it employed in January  2006.', 'Trump has said more plants will lead to more blue-collar jobs.', '  “We have a very big push on to have auto plants and other plants  — many other plants,” Trump told reporters Tuesday. “It’s  happening.”', '  So far, the United Auto Workers has not commented on the president’s push. But there’s no doubt union leaders would love  to see another GM, Ford or Fiat Chrysler plant where they could  add hundreds of new members.', '  — Reuters contributed to this report.']"
141,San Antonio Spurs’ executives discuss their new vision for the team and Gregg Popovich’s future,2020-08-30T17:27:25+0000,"['Fire Gregg Popovich.', 'It’s the first thing one NBA executive said he would do if given the challenge of taking over one of the most successful franchises in the National Basketball Association.', 'The long-time Spurs coach led the team to five NBA titles, and the franchise’s 22-year playoff run concluded only recently, due in part to the coronavirus pandemic. At 1,277 wins, Popovich is the third-winningest coach in NBA history. ', 'So, fire Popovich? ', 'Andy Dolich, the Memphis Grizzlies’ former president, laughed when told about the executive’s first move. He called it a “knee jerk reaction.” Instead, Dolich suggested a “deep look at the organization” to identify areas of improvement.', '“That’s how real businesses get better,” he said.', 'The question, though: After so much dominance, so many memorable moments with David Robinson, Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginobili, how do you rebuild the Spurs, sports and entertainment?', 'How do the Spurs start another 22 years of dominance in the NBA? ', 'To find the answers, the team set up a Zoom call with three of the organization’s top executives, including CEO R.C. Buford and general manager Brian Wright. ', 'The executive who wanted Popovich gone laughed after the notion. He knows the chances are slim but recalled Popovich’s first move when talking over the Spurs in 1996: He fired then-coach Bob Hill.', 'Dolich said the Spurs could do what he labeled a “SWOT Test.”', '“Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and drill down to every part of the organization,” he said. “See what we have that’s still strong, see what we have that’s weak, and create plans for making it stronger.”', 'The first question on the Zoom call to Buford: In which areas are the Spurs currently weak?', '“Are we only going to talk about the weaknesses,” Buford answered.', 'He then spoke of the Spurs’ values-based system, mentioned the team’s 47 years in the NBA, making the postseason 39 times in that span, and a .599 winning percentage, best in league history.', '“That is the history and the legacy that we’re here to build from,” Buford said. “And from a vision standpoint, it’s not going to change a whole lot – values based, culture focused, community engaged, and championship driven.”', 'Over the last five months, the world has been rocked with a pandemic, which forced the NBA to shut down on March 11, and social unrest following the death of George Floyd on May 25. Buford said the Spurs have learned “articulating our vision and our messaging is going to be important.”', 'But the Spurs could use an upgrade in several areas, including its practice site, the dreadful AT&T Center, which lacks adequate Wifi and is soon coming up on naming rights in 2022 for the building.', 'Through an email, AT&T confirmed the naming rights expiration but did not make an official available to discuss the matter.', 'The vision also includes being more open to the public. The Spurs have used social media to give a more behind the scenes look at the franchise through new assets like “Spurs Stories.” ', 'It’s a data play, as the team is seeking new revenue streams with Covid-19 changing engagement strategies. The Spurs’ fan base are some of the most loyal in the NBA; hence, providing them a closer look inside of the franchise could be lucrative if the metrics follow.', 'Brandon Gayle, the Spurs’ new executive vice president of partnerships and revenue, was also on the Zoom call and discussed the vision.', 'Gayle, who Buford recruited from Facebook, will help oversee the team’s desire to expand reach from Monterrey, Mexico to Austin. “How do we start to own that full territory and all the points around it and in-between,” he said. ', 'Gayle said creating “a peek behind the curtain so folks will get to know this brand and understand what it stands for” will help that growth. If the Spurs can build a new audience and collect the metrics, Gayle said, monetization opportunities should follo,w allowing the team to grow its roughly $285 million in revenue.', 'Gayle said AT&T and Frost Bank “have been great and committed to our partnership.” AT&T has arena naming rights worth about $2 million per season and Frost Bank has a jersey sponsorship. If for some reason they pull out, however, it would offer a “great opportunity to extend our regional and global perspective,” Gayle said.', 'He added the Spurs are strong locally, and “business supports that from a revenue standpoint over these last 22 years.” “But we’ve got a real opportunity to maximize that revenue generation as we think about the brand globally and even regionally,” he said. ', 'Gayle said the Spurs would also start improving its app making more cashless options available as it hopes to lure fans back once health and safety conditions allow.', 'Tom James, the Spurs’ long-time communications chief, then chimed into the Zoom conversation. He mentioned the team’s new photographer, who has “full access.”', '“He can do whatever he wants,” James said of the photographer’s access to gather the content. “You know us. That’s a big shift.”', '“We had to get you to leave before we start doing that,” humored Buford, referencing this reporter, who covered the Spurs before coming to CNBC.', 'Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the vision that fans are concerned with has to do with the basketball product.', 'One Western Conference team executive praised Popovich’s job in the NBA Disney bubble, noting the Spurs’ small-ball lineup, which he called a “unique style” but questioned its roster direction overall.', 'Do the Spurs go young and rebuild? Another model is staying competitive and attracting another top free agent, similar to what the team did in 2015, when it landed LaMarcus Aldridge from the Portland Trail Blazers?', '“We think we’re positioned well with the mix of veterans that we have and the mix of younger guys developing along the way,” said Wright.', 'Aldridge will make $24 million next year, and co-star DeMar DeRozan has a $27 million player option. Near the NBA’s trade deadline, the Spurs were rumored to be shopping Aldridge, but rival executives suggest the Spurs “overplayed their hand thinking they were supposed to get some giant package for him,” one NBA executive said. ', 'The Spurs could shop Aldridge again this offseason. Aldridge had repaired his relationship with Blazers superstar Damian Lillard, and one agent suggests the Spurs could ship him back to the Blazers.', 'On the DeRozan front, he’ll likely decide to pick up his option. The Spurs could build around him, using the team’s bubble play as a roster model or trade him, too, should he opt out. DeRozan is close with Miami Heat star Jimmy Butler, and one agent forecast a possible Spurs-Heat package.', 'It’s Wright’s job to help fix the roster, and the NBA’s economics around its 2020-21 salary cap will be critical. But having been promoted less than a year ago, Wright is still learning the Spurs’ way. That came through on the Zoom call. ', 'Asked how the Spurs can rebuild, Buford intercepted Wright’s question.', ' “Jabari let me answer this one,” Buford interrupted. “It’s more fair for me to [answer] since I’ve been engaged in this for a long time.”', 'Buford explained the Spurs have never been swayed by public opinion. To back this, he remembered calls to “blow it up” at the end of David Robinson’s era, and then again at the end of 2009-10 season.', 'Buford said the Spurs would continue to address its roster “optimistically and opportunistically.” He then mentioned Aldridge’s signing, which translated to a Western Conference finals appearance in 2016.', '“Things didn’t go as we hoped, and it’s not on anybody,” Buford said. “Some decisions we wished we could’ve done differently, but I think having the ability to develop young talent and flexibility to be opportunistic is going to be what we’re going to continue to do.”', 'But who will be on the sidelines as the roster continues to develop?', 'According to Buford, even with the Spurs’ vision shifting in a different direction, it’s still channeled through Popovich, who is 71, and that will continue. ', '“Pop’s vision has clearly been our North Star,” he said. “However, having said that, when we get ready to make a decision, we all get in the room, and everybody needs to be prepared, and he doesn’t care who it is that gets the right answer, as long as we get the right answer.”', 'Asked about the Popovich to New York rumors, where former Spurs executive and current Brooklyn Nets GM Sean Marks could be seeking his services, Buford said the Spurs are “under the assumption” Popovich is returning. The coach is also scheduled to coach the USA basketball men’s national team in next summer’s rescheduled Olympic games in Tokyo. ', '“I don’t know if he’s told Brian any differently,” Buford said. “Pop’s shown nothing other than how we’re going to build our team for next year.”', 'But Buford added: “Pop’s vision will be in play long after his presence. That doesn’t mean it’ll be him in there making those decisions, but we’ve all learned together, and you’re not going to step away from a values-based, team-building aspect that focuses on culture and coming to work every day and working on it.”', 'As the Spurs approach 50 years in the NBA, the team is looking to celebrate its organization, Buford said. He concluded the Zoom discussion assuring the Holt family’s commitment to San Antonio despite turning a $75 million investment in 1993 to $1.8 billion and a recent minority ownership change.', '“Pieces change all the time – not much here but in other organizations,” Buford said. “Individual investors, for whatever reason, change all the time. But the Holt family’s commitment to the community, we’re here in San Antonio to stay.”']"
