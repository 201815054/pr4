0,Trump security pick John Bolton likely to turn up heat on Iran and boost oil prices,2018-03-23T18:08:06+0000,"['President Donald Trump’s pick for national security advisor signals a willingness by the administration to take a more aggressive stand against U.S. adversaries like Iran or Venezuela —and that could mean higher oil prices in the very near future.', 'Analysts said the appointment of John Bolton, former U.N. ambassador, makes it even more likely that the Trump administration will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal when it is up for review in May, and tensions could ramp up against the Middle Eastern country. Bolton succeeds H.R. McMaster, who resigned.', '“I can’t think of a more hawkish appointment than John Bolton,” said Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC. “He’s a powerful advocate for a confrontational approach.”', 'Croft also said the appointment appears to leave Defense Secretary James Mattis as the only one representing a moderate foreign policy at this point. “Are the Iranians seeing the writing on the wall? Will they curb their activities? His appointment should put the fear of God in them, but who knows.”', 'Bolton has advocated for pre-emptive action against both Iran and North Korea because of their nuclear programs. His first act may be to successfully encourage Trump to end the Iran nuclear deal, struck with Iran by the U.S., some members of the European Union and other countries as a way to curb its nuclear program in return for ending sanctions on the country, including its oil.', 'Mattis and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had been reluctant to abandon the Iran deal, which also included China and Russia. Further financial sanctions against the country have also been discussed.', 'Venezuela’s economic crisis is complicating matters and damaging its energy production capabilities. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is running for re-election despite the objections of the U.S. and other countries that the election is unfair. Venezuelan oil already is coming off the market, and could continue to decline as the country’s energy infrastructure deteriorates.', '“Even if it’s just additional sanctions on Iran, that could hurt investment in the country and reduce flows of their oil. The market would really miss their oil this time around because of Venezuela,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital. “Because of Iran’s advanced ballistic missile capabilities, the other countries have offered additional sanctions to try to keep Trump in the nuclear pact.”', 'Oil prices were higher Friday, with West Texas Intermediate futures trading over $65, a nearly 2 percent gain. Gold, benefiting Friday from fears about trade wars, could also gain if the U.S. becomes more aggressive, not just with Iran but others like Venezuela or North Korea. Gold futures for April rose 1.5 percent Friday, to $1,347 per ounce.', 'Croft said May will be important for oil prices, with the Iran deal up for renewal May 12 and the Venezuela election on May 20. “If they go forward with those elections, we could see much more coercive economic policies toward Venezuela. That’s when the oil market might start paying attention,” she said.', '“The oil market is underappreciating the importance of the personnel changes,” she added. “They’re underpricing the personnel changes.”', 'Global oil demand has been improving and the pact between OPEC and Russia has helped steady prices and send them higher. Growing U.S. production from shale fields like the Permian Basin has added supply while Russia and Saudi Arabia have reduced theirs.', 'Kilduff said geopolitical tensions have moved prices higher recently, including anti-Iranian comments from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who said that if Iran develops a nuclear weapon, so will Saudi Arabia.', 'In an interview on CBS’ “60 Minutes,” the prince also compared Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, to Adolph Hitler. The prince is currently in the U.S., and met with Trump earlier this week.', 'Saudi Arabia and Iran are engaged in a proxy war in Yemen, and are at odds on Syria, which Iran has supported.', 'Croft said if the U.S. drops out of the nuclear deal it could take an even harsher posture toward Iran. “The question is, are we talking about efforts to economically isolate Iran, or are we talking about efforts to change the regime?” she said. “This is where the Permian makes things different. If this had been 2010, oil would be much higher. There’s a view that U.S. short cycle oil makes a difference. We could just make up for anything.”', 'But Croft doesn’t see proof that U.S. shale could make up for a shortfall in the world market.', '“I haven’t gotten any evidence,” she said. “I don’t see any signs that OPEC is going to be quick to rush in and save things.” She said with the changes in Washington, it’s possible there could be 200,000 to 300,000 Iranian barrels off the market by the fourth quarter, and Venezuelan production losses could total 1 million barrels. ', 'Bolton served in the Reagan administration, and President George W. Bush named him undersecretary of state for arms control and international security. Bush also appointed him as his representative to the U.N., which Bolton called irrelevant. Ultimately, Congress blocked his confirmation and he had to step down from that role.', '“Bolton is the hawk’s hawk,” wrote Cliff Kupchan, chairman of Eurasia Group. He noted that besides pushing for pre-emptive strikes on North Korea’s nuclear program, he has criticized the planned Trump-Kim Jong Un summit as useless.', '“He’s a fierce opponent of the Iran nuclear deal. In 2015, before the deal, Bolton penned an op-ed titled ‘To Stop Iran’s Bomb, Bomb Iran.’ Bolton’s appointment will likely make US policy on both hot-button issues more hardline,” added Kupchan. “At least on the margins, the chance of a strike on North Korea goes up, of successful US-North Korea diplomacy goes down, and the Iran deal is in even more trouble.”']"

Stocks most sensitive to the economy’s reopening dragged markets lower as Covid-19 cases in the U.S. surpassed two million. Hospitalizations rose to a record level for a third straight day on Wednesday in Texas, one of the states in the phase one reopening plan, prompting fears that a second wave of cases could be coming.', '“The global economy is still in a precarious position,” noted Cailin Birch, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit. “The dip in oil prices in recent days most likely reflects the end of the price boost that came from the initial economic re-opening.

Banks are preparing for a wave of oil bankruptcies by setting up their own oil companies to operate seized assets. Regulators in Texas are considering setting limits on the state’s production, an approach more reminiscent of Soviet-style central planning than a Republican-controlled regulatory body. An oil company executive just admitted, ″No one wants to give us capital because we have all destroyed capital and created economic waste.”', 'And the energy sector’s valuation is shrinking to such a degree that it has become the second smallest segment in the entire S&P index, with its weighting down 80% from a decade ago.', 'All of these developments would have been unthinkable just a few months ago, and yet all are headlines from just the past week in the oil patch. This remarkable shift has implications that go well beyond any near-term damage to the industry’s finances. The change in narrative — from a focus on the industry’s resilience to its fragility — threatens to reframe how the financial community thinks about the future of the oil and gas industry, and even its very investability in a world beset by geopolitical infighting and looming demand destruction from the low-carbon transition. Long after some semblance of stability is restored to the world economy, the industry’s downgrade in investability threatens to be the longest-lasting and most consequential impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the oil and gas sector.', 'In political theory, the concept of the Overton Window explains how ideas can go from the fringe to the center of discourse (“from the unthinkable to the mainstream”) with great rapidity, and how public perception of what is a “mainstream” idea can influence the real world actions of those who actually decide what policies get implemented and which get ignored.', 'A similar process may be at work in the financial community’s thinking about the oil and gas sector. For decades, the oil and gas sector sat athwart the financial world, with index-beating returns that placed their stocks at the core of many investors’ portfolios. In 1980, 7 of the 10 largest stocks in the S&P 500 were oil companies, representing 29% of the index. As recently as a decade ago, that weighting was 15%. Today, with Exxon having dropped to No. 28, there are no oil companies in the top 10 for the first time in the history of the S&P, and the industry’s weighting is below 3% — its lowest in history. The oil industry has gone from the mainstream to the fringes of investors’ portfolios with remarkable speed.', 'The COVID-19 crisis, and the tremendous drop in oil prices that it has brought about, threatens to make this shift permanent by redefining the financial community’s sense of what a worst-case scenario looks like for the oil industry. In effect, we are witnessing a real-time movement of the Overton Window, as an industry that used to tout its resilience at oil prices as low as $40 is now facing a prolonged period where prices may be half that amount or less.', 'The industry’s claims of resilience in the face of climate change came in response to years of engagement by major investors pushing oil companies to consider the strategic implications of a low-carbon transition for their business. While the companies differed in how they responded to these inquiries, there was one common theme: all of them claimed that, while there might be asset strandings in the industry as a result of climate change, it wouldn’t be their assets that got stranded. Somehow, the oil industry was composed of dozens of major companies, all of whom would be the ones producing the last barrel of oil as the world moves away from fossil fuels.', 'Conveniently for the industry, the oil price that most companies used to “stress test” their portfolios against a low-carbon future was around $40/barrel--basically the level at which these companies break even. What the COVID-19 crisis has revealed, however, is that the industry’s actual worst case scenario is much more challenging and much less comforting to its investors — a price that according to one industry executive means that “we will disappear as an industry.” It seems clear, with all that has happened in the past few weeks, that investors will never look at this sector the same way again.', 'This crisis is confronting the industry with a stress test that mirrors the sort of demand shock it could face in a decarbonizing future. Just last summer, Mark Lewis with BNP Paribas wrote a white paper arguing that advances in electric vehicle technology would eventually force the price of oil down to $10-$20/barrel — precisely where it is trading today, though at the time the idea was derided as unthinkable. What the current situation makes clear is that few if any oil companies can survive that sort of environment. A key difference is that the current situation is likely to be temporary, whereas demand destruction related to the low-carbon transition will be permanent. Why would an investor risk capital in an industry saddled with debt where the main product can go below breakeven costs for long periods of time?', 'So what can be done? The industry -- at least those companies that survive the downturn — needs to prepare for a very different kind of future, one in which volatility and uncertainty around demand will rule the day, and the only companies that attract capital will be the ones with detailed, specific and ambitious plans for managing the transition, and even pivoting to renewable energy — or for winding down their assets in an orderly way.', 'Prodded by investors, including those making up Climate Action 100+, a few companies, including Shell, BP and Repsol, are taking steps to move in that direction. Yet that leaves much of the industry — and substantial investor capital — at risk as the Overton Window continues to shift toward a low-carbon future.', '—By Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at Ceres, a nonprofit organization that works with institutional investors and companies on sustainability']"

For example, a company can state how much is has lowered its global carbon emissions in a given year. “But that’s very limited,” he said, “because they’re not disclosing their emissions by region,” which can widely vary from one location to the next. “When it comes to carbon intensity, it’s in the [overall] portfolio.”', 'Or a company can ply in greenwashing through carbon offsets. “I have massive emissions, so I’ll [plant] a bunch of forests, and that way I neutralize myself,” Malek said — while the company is still producing the same amount of emissions. “You’re disclosing in a way that’s better optically than it is in reality.

But experts focused on climate and the energy sector note that sector targets often don’t go far enough, related to reducing intensity of fossil fuel operations, not underlying production of fossil fuels, and dealing only with Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, not the Scope 3 emissions which are the largest share of the climate problem.', 'O’Connor said that companies should be careful how they align ESG metrics with incentives. “ESG is a broad and complex set of metrics and expectations,” she said. “That’s one of the reasons why we’re seeing a number of companies use multiple metrics rather than a single measure, to get a better balance of considerations and perspectives across the ESG forum. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all policy in this, and there’s a danger in trying to move too quickly and revert to some kind of standard.”', 'The pandemic placed an unexpected hard top on compensation incentives in 2020, and with the global economy decimated last year, Shell’s remuneration board decided to forego bonuses for CEO Ben van Beurden, CFO Jessica Uhl and other top executives, and there was no direct link in their LTIPs to delivery of energy transition targets.', 'The energy sector has roared back this year amid strong global economic growth and demand for oil and gas amid lower supply has led to a spike in prices.

Within this, though, progress in energy transition is now up from 10% to 15% of the total amount that can be awarded. In addition, energy transition is part of the LTIP which vests three years in the future, based on Shell’s 2020 annual report.', 'According to a 2019 McKinsey study, there is growing evidence that adopting ESG is not just a feel-good fad, but that when done right creates value. And that may be enough to convince more oil and gas companies to link it to compensation, especially because it’s one of the few industries where ESG is existential, Kuk said. “Sometimes we think about ESG in the context of doing good, and it is doing good. But I still believe there has to be a business reason for everything. And it’s only when you have a business reason that ESG will prevail.”', 'The deleterious role that carbon emissions play in climate change will continue to put pressure on oil and gas companies to embrace the International Energy Agency’s goal of achieving net-zero by 2050. Beyond complying with regulatory mandates, though, linking reduction targets to executives’ compensation may be a critical driver in affecting change. ']"

Since the export restrictions were lifted in 2015, as part of the multilateral deal that offered economic relief in exchange for curbs to Iran’s nuclear program — formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) — that figure increased by more than 1 million.', 'President Donald Trump announced on May 8 that the U.S. would leave the deal, immediately sending oil prices into a tailspin.

Already Japan and South Korea have signaled they will try to seek waivers from the U.S. to continue buying Iranian crude.', '“We have a demand that is increasing 1.6 to 1.7 million bpd yearly average, so that is going to create a disruption in terms of cost and price,” he added. “And when we have this kind of situation, the landscape becomes very uncertain.”', 'Some analysts, however, predict the impact will actually be minimal, particularly in comparison to Obama’s 2012 sanctions — they say Trump could reduce Iran’s oil shipments by 300,000 to 500,000 bpd, far short of the 1 million to 1.5 million bpd that were cut from the market six years ago.', 'Still, price uncertainty ahead means uncertainty for investors, particularly those looking at long-term, multi-billion dollar projects like those required for the extractives sector.', '“For energy you have to make big investments,” Descalzi added. “And when there is a lot of uncertainty, the investment is not easy to be performed. But there are so many other geopolitical issues, that the landscape is very difficult to understand where we’re going.”', 'Asked if he thought Trump’s decision was ill-judged, the CEO pointed to its impact on Europe and stressed his hope for a diplomatic solution.

International benchmark  has tumbled as much as $6 a barrel from its recent 3½-year high of $80.50, but has rebounded to about $78 a barrel.', '“I think it’s temporary. I think the fundamental picture is still really strong. The market’s getting a bit dislocated right now based on a risk-off sentiment,” Tamar Essner, director of energy and utilities at Nasdaq Corporate Solutions told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Thursday.', 'Essner said the market’s aversion to risk has been stoked by concerns about the Trump administration’s looming trade wars and questions about the integrity of the European Union, which have caused the U.S. dollar to strengthen. A stronger greenback makes commodities sold in U.S. dollars more expensive to holders of other currencies.', 'Oil prices were already heading lower on recent reports that OPEC, Russia and several other producer nations could soon begin winding down their 17-month-old deal to cap output. That agreement has drained a global glut of oil and helped balance the market, but it’s now under review due to falling Venezuelan output and renewed U.S. sanctions against Iran, OPEC’s third-biggest producer.', 'Venezuela’s output has fallen by about 500,000 barrels a day this year and could drop by the same amount by year’s end, Essner said. Meanwhile, U.S. drillers would struggle to boost output by more than 1.2 million barrels a day.', '“So we need every last barrel of those supplies to take us to where we need to balance the market,” Essner said.', 'Underscoring Essner’s point, oil futures reversed some of their losses on Thursday after weekly data showed a big drop in U.S. crude inventories.', 'American drillers that specialize in freeing crude oil from shale rock formations are facing worker shortages and limited pipeline capacity in western Texas. At the same time, these drillers are focused on returning value to their shareholders, rather than plowing revenue into new production.', '“Shale is not Superman,” Helima Croft, global head of commodities strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC earlier in the week.', 'Shale drillers face yet another hurdle to upping output, according to Essner. Many agreed to deliver oil to customers at prices far below today’s levels — a practice known as hedging — and set capital spending plans assuming prices would average about $60 this year.  “They’re sort of locked in, and when you look at the slope of the futures curve, it’s going downward. That makes it harder to hedge production at attractive prices for further-out years,” Essner said.', 'Oil prices are likely to settle around $70 per barrel, said Essner, who believes futures rose to that level largely on supply-and-demand fundamentals.', 'OPEC would likely intervene if oil prices threatened to drop below the $70 per barrel mark, according to Sadad Al-Husseini, founder and president of Husseini Energy Company, on Wednesday.', '“Clearly $80 a barel was way too high and was going much higher, he told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” on Wednesday. “On the other hand they don’t want to lose the floor. Dropping below $70 would be clearly too low, so they’re trying to coordinate their strategies ahead of the OPEC meeting on June 22.”', 'Husseini said the physical market — where barrels are bought and sold to satisfy actual demand — are “pretty well balanced.” For that reason, there’s little urgency for OPEC to change its policy until it assesses how far Venezuelan output will drop and to what degree U.S. sanctions will take Iranian barrels off the market.', '“There is spare capacity. OPEC can if necessary add production, and if that gets called for, I’m sure the ministers will do that. They just don’t want to get ahead of themselves because right now there isn’t an issue,” he said.', 'U.S. production may be about to top out, but the industry should work through the bottlenecks by next year, he said.

34,Trump rushes to lock down oil drilling in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge before Biden takes office,2020-12-04T14:22:18+0000,"['The Trump administration announced Thursday that it will auction off drilling rights in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in just over a month, setting up a final showdown with opponents before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.', 'The sale, which is now set for Jan. 6, could cap a bitter, decades-long battle over whether to drill in the coastal plain, a 19-million-acre expanse that’s home to Native tribes as well as caribou, polar bears and other wildlife. The Trump administration has made it a priority to open the land to development.', '“Congress directed us to hold lease sales in the ANWR Coastal Plain, and we have taken a significant step in announcing the first sale in advance of the December 2021 deadline set by law,” said a statement Thursday from Chad Padgett, the Alaska state director for the Bureau of Land Management.', 'A Republican-led Congress approved legislation that opened up the coastal plain to oil development in 2017. It required two lease sales within seven years, including the first no later than the end of 2021.', 'While it has been reported that the Alaska Oil and Gas Association took Thursday’s announcement as good news, the Trump administration’s plan for the sale may draw legal challenges from drilling opponents, who could target the aggressive timeline in court. Already, conservation and tribal groups, as well as a coalition of 15 states, have filed lawsuits challenging the Trump administration’s environmental reviews. ', 'The Trump administration has moved forward with other oil and gas projects in the state, including approving development plans within the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska that Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said would make “a significant contribution” to keeping oil flowing through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline for years to come. ', 'Energy industry experts are now looking at the economics of drilling for oil in Alaska’s Arctic Wildlife Refuge. The problem: It would cost an estimated average of $100 a barrel to extract oil from that part of Alaska, says Moody’s Analytics energy economist Chris Lafakis, and the current price of crude is under $50. That suggests that even if Trump does manage to find bidders for the leases — and that Biden doesn’t block the permits winning bidders would need to begin drilling — it could take years before the oil begins to flow, if it ever does. “And it is unlikely to reverse the long-term decline in Alaska’s oil production, which has been hampered by competition from cheaper to produce oil from Texas and North Dakota since the development of hydraulic fracking technology in the early 2000s.”', '“A sale of new leases is more a public relations stunt than anything else,” said Stewart Glickman, energy strategist at investment-research firm CFRA Research. “Attracting fresh capital to Alaska means someone has a very bullish view of long-term energy prices. The combination of a hostile federal government, an energized environmental opposition, [social and corporate-governance focused] investing as a secular force, none of these bode well.’”', 'It’s not clear who will bid on the leases, but it’s unlikely they will pay much — certainly not enough to make any dent in the federal government’s finances. The two largest drillers in other areas of Alaska have been Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, each of which declined to comment for this article on whether they would bid on ANWR leases. The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the industry’s interests in Washington, referred an interview request to the companies. ', 'Drillers have paid relatively little recently for leases in other high-cost drilling areas, most of which have been offshore drilling auctions in the lower 48 states, said Kevin Book, managing director at ClearView Energy, a Washington research firm. All of the offshore drilling leases made available by the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management in recent years have raised less than $1 billion put together, he said.', '“Companies will be cautious about being too interested,” Book said. “It’s effectively a call option. At a low enough price, it will clear.”', 'In Alaska, drilling has dropped by more than half over the last 20 years, and even more from a peak reached in the late 1980s, as cheaper sources of supply in the continental U.S. were unlocked by technical innovations like hydraulic fracking, according to U.S. Energy Department data. It now produces roughly 500,000 barrels per day of crude oil, far below its peak of 2 million bpd in the late 1980s.', 'Indeed, BP has pulled out of its Prudhoe Bay drilling and Trans-Alaska Pipeline operations, selling them for $5.6 billion in 2020 to privately-held Hilcorp Energy, said Peter McNally, global sector lead for energy at New York investment-research firm Third Bridge. He doesn’t expect Hilcorp to bid on ANWR leases.', 'ConocoPhillips gets about 5% of its oil production from Alaska and Exxon Mobil gets about 2%, said CFRA Research energy strategist Stewart Glickman. ', 'Whoever does buy any leases from the outgoing administration will have to cope with a tough environment for both regulation and financing.', 'Before drilling, a winner of a lease auction would have to procure eight or nine different federal permits from the Biden administration, which the new team isn’t likely to grant quickly and maybe not at all, said Glenn Schwartz, director of energy policy at Rapidan Energy Group, a Bethesda, Maryland-based consulting firm.', '“The bottom line is that it will take as long as the incoming administration wants it to,″ Schwartz said.', 'Winning bidders also will have to deal with the increasing inroads environmentalists have made in convincing banks not to finance more oil drilling, especially in sensitive areas like the ANWR, the only place in America where polar bears, black bears and brown bears all live, said Athan Manuel, director of lands protection for the Sierra Club.', 'Already, the six major Wall Street banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, have declared that they will not finance drilling in the area, much of which is considered sacred by the Native American Gwich’in tribe, Manuel said. Environmentalists have been targeting banks since the 2017 tax bill authorized Trump to eventually open the ANWR to drilling.', '“They don’t want to invest in projects that make climate change worse,” Manuel said. “We have always reached for funding levers we can pull -- banks, insurance companies are next.”', 'The way it could work is if the oil companies are patient, said Allyson Cutright, director of Rapidan’s Global Oil Service. ', 'The plan would be to wait for oil prices to rise after the end of the coronavirus-inspired recession, back toward the $80 level that Brent crude reached as recently as 2018, or even the $120 top in 2012, Cutright said. Prices often rise sharply after periods of disinvestment by oil drillers, as supplies are caught short when economic activity rebounds. At the same time, the average cost of production would fall once initial costs to build roads, pipelines and other infrastructure into the wilderness were amortized, she said. One big edge Alaskan oil fields have is that they last much longer than wells drilled for fracking, letting producers spread infrastructure costs over years.', '“The draw to that area is that it’s so untouched you might find another big field like Prudhoe Bay, which has stayed in production since 1968,” Cutright said. ', 'The longer-term problem with that is the advent of electric vehicles, which puts secular pressure on demand for gasoline and diesel fuel, the final destination for more than 80% of U.S. crude oil, according to the Energy Department. EVs use no gasoline, and experts at Bloomberg NEF and elsewhere expect passenger EVs to be cheaper than internal combustion engine rivals by about the middle of this decade, though Cutright predicts a gradual transition to EVs will leave a major role for petroleum for 20 years or more.', 'The inability of the ANWR to make a medium-term difference in the budget or America’s energy supply leaves the question of why Trump is even bothering, Manuel said. And the answer may be that he’s out to “own” liberals one last time, even though prospects of reviving Alaskan oil drilling are no greater than that of bringing back coal production ravaged by utilities’ rapid shift from coal to cheaper natural gas and, more recently, to renewable electricity as the cost of wind and solar power has dropped.', '“Part of it is spite, [and] none of it makes economic sense,” Manuel said. “This is just like telling West Virginia coal miners that jobs will come back because Trump waves a wand.” ']"
