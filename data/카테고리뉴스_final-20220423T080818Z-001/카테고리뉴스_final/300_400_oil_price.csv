That led Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter and the de facto leader of the energy cartel, to slash oil prices and threaten to ramp up production. ', 'A supply glut has kept oil prices relatively low in recent years, as OPEC+ — made up of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its non-OPEC allies such as Russia — coordinated production cuts to support energy prices. The current agreement expires at the end of March, which means that starting Apr. 1, countries can pump as much oil as they want unless the producers can reach an agreement before that. ', '“The Indian economy is a major winner from lower world oil prices,” Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit, told CNBC, pointing out that more than 80% of India’s total energy consumption in the 2018-2019 financial year was imported. He explained that falling energy prices could reduce India’s inflation and lower the cost of its import bill — that could, in turn, help narrow the country’s trade and current account deficits. ', 'India lost its crown as one of the fastest-growing major economies in recent quarters, owing to a number of internal and external factors that dragged GDP expansion to below 5%. In the three months that ended in December, India expanded at 4.7%, in line with market expectations.

Discretionary purchasing power refers to the amount of cash a person has available to spend after discounting their tax, debt obligation, and other expenses.', 'She explained that domestic oil prices could potentially become cheaper and declining margin pressures on non-oil businesses may translate into some relief for the low demand weighing on the economy.', '“If accompanied by an improvement in sentiments and better confidence over income prospects, this would spell good news for growth,” Rao said. “We are hopeful that an increase in government spending, positive net exports position and base effects could push up (fiscal 2021) growth.”', 'India’s fiscal year 2021 begins on Apr. 1 of this year.', 'Biswas added that sharply lower oil and gas costs would also help boost profitability for sectors that are intensive users of petroleum — such as petrochemicals, power generation, and transportation. ', 'Softening of inflationary pressure on the economy could also give the Reserve Bank of India more room to cut interest rates further in an attempt to help stimulate growth and improve the flow of money in India’s financial markets, he said. ', 'Data from India’s commerce ministry showed between April and December — the current fiscal year ends on Mar. 2020 — the country’s import bill for oil was $95.69 billion, almost 12% lower than a year ago. It accounted for an estimated 21% of India’s total imports during that period when oil prices remained above $50 a barrel. ', 'India’s Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told CNBC last month he would be happy if crude prices were at levels between $50 and $60 a barrel.', 'As of Thursday afternoon in Asia, both U.S. crude and Brent prices traded under $35 a barrel. ', 'For every dollar the price of oil drops, India saves approximately $1.5 billion, according to Akhil Bery, an analyst at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group. “However that is offset by the weaker rupee, so the benefits may not be as much as originally anticipated,” he told CNBC. In the last 12 months, the rupee weakened against the greenback from levels near 70 to around 74 and oil prices are usually measured in U.S. dollars. ', '“It will help alleviate some of the fiscal pressures that the government has been under,” Bery added.', 'Experts pointed that whatever benefits India may potentially get from lower oil prices could be wiped out if there is a sudden, rapid coronavirus outbreak within the country, similar to what happened in places like Italy, Iran and South Korea. As of Mar. 11, India said it has 60 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 disease. ']"

A potential supply glut could pressure prices further.', '“Both events – coronavirus and OPEC+ falling apart were not expected or priced into the market a month ago,” said Rebecca Babin, senior equity trader for CIBC Private Wealth Management. She said the key things to watch going forward are whether or not Saudi Arabia and Russia reach a “Hail Mary” deal, and if not, how quickly U.S. supply is shut in to support prices.', '“There is still significant uncertainty, but the commodity market is not waiting around to find out if miracles can happen,” she added.', 'The XLE, which tracks the energy sector, and the XOP, which tracks oil and gas companies, fell 19% and 27%, respectively, on Monday.', 'The unfolding of events is reminiscent of 2014 when Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the U.S. competed for market share in the oil industry.

Energy analysts, looking at global oil storage by way of satellite data, say that while storage capacity is filling up, it’s not near its limit yet.', 'Even though recent production cuts have been by “historic amounts,” Ursa Space Systems analyst Geoffrey Craig explained that the cuts to supply are “a fraction of the decline in demand.”', '“The next catalyst will be inventories hitting capacity limits. The way you will know that is through satellite imagery, because the data isn’t available outside of the U.S.,” Craig told CNBC.', 'Ursa Space Systems, Kayrros and Orbital Insight are three analytics firms that specialize in applications for satellite data, especially for clients in the oil and gas industry. The firms make use of a variety of sources for data, ranging from  European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-5 satellites to imagery from commercial companies like Planet Labs or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites. SAR is a type of imagery that can see at night, or even through cloud cover, to provide a constant view of an area from space.', '“We’re looking every week using satellite imagery at tanks all over the world,” Craig said. “What we see in storage matches really well with what you see in seeing price action.”', 'The difficulty and cost of storing crude oil at the U.S. hub in Cushing, Oklahoma was a major factor in the collapse of U.S. oil prices earlier this week. It caused the May contract for U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures to tumble into negative territory for the first time ever on Monday.', '“We’re already at a price point where the signal to any operator globally is to shut down production,” Kayrros market strategist Ted Hall told CNBC.', 'While U.S. oil production has begun to slow, falling to 12.2 million barrels a day last week from 13.1 million barrels a day a month ago, the cuts are not enough to match the lack of demand.', '“In oil, we expect the market to test global storage capacity in the next 3-4 weeks (WTI was a local event), which will likely create substantial volatility with more spikes to the downside until supply finally equals demand, as with nowhere to store the oil, supply has no other option but to be shut-in down in-line with the expected demand losses,” Goldman Sachs said in a note to investors on Friday.', 'There are about 3.2 billion barrels of crude oil already in global inventories, according to Orbital Insight, a record high. The majority of land-based oil storage is in the form of Floating Roof Tanks (FRT).

', 'Beyond FRT storage are alternatives, such as fixed roof tanks, salt caverns, or even more expensive floating storage like tankers at sea. Ursa said recent estimates put sea-based tanker storage at about 160 million barrels. Essentially, the lower price of oil drops, the more oil producers look to expensive types of storage capacity as viable. Storage capacity options have an inverse relationship to production methods, as more expensive methods of extracting oil become viable as the price rises.', '“There’s still places to put oil. It’s been diminished because volumes have increased because of the amount that’s been leased out.

I think the intent of this conversation with OPEC and the rest of the G-20 countries is simply to do exactly that, to mitigate.” ', 'An early victim of the oil price crash has been the U.S. shale industry, which is now hemorrhaging jobs as highly-indebted oil producers in the U.S. begin filing for bankruptcy.  Up to 240,000 oil-related jobs in the U.S. will be lost this year, according to consultancy firm Rystad Energy. ', 'Saudi Arabia slashed its oil selling prices and increased production after Russia refused to join its plan to further cut output and boost prices in early March. With the two countries reversing course on oil policy in order to pursue greater market share, many suspected the moves were targeting U.S. shale, whose production would largely cease to be economically viable once prices fell below around $50 per barrel. U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate is now trading at less than $20 per barrel.', 'Despite Sunday’s production cut agreement, the largest in history, oil prices still fell by 10% on Tuesday as investors remained unconvinced that the cuts will counter the demand destruction wrought by the virus. But a price bounce was not the aim, Brouillette told CNBC. Rather, he argued, it prevented an even deeper hit to the markets.', '“I don’t think that that was the intent of the conversation, at least with regard to the United States,” he said, referring to hopes for a price jump. “I think it was more important for us to stem the losses that were occurring all throughout the marketplace as a result of some of the activities and that loss of demand as a result of the pandemic … (It) is very important that we not allow the market to continue down to what could have been single-digit numbers for the price of a barrel of oil.”', 'Brouillette nonetheless expressed optimism for the longer-term future of shale, saying that “once we get on the other side of this event, they’re going to come back stronger than ever.” He added that for now, however, “there are certainly players in the shale industry who are heavily leveraged and perhaps some of those folks will not survive this extraordinary event, this pandemic event.”', 'The March production and pricing moves by OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia angered many in Washington, with U.S. lawmakers writing to President Donald Trump to urge the kingdom to halt its activity they described as destabilizing to the oil markets. “The effect was pretty alarming to many here in the United States,” Brouillette said.', 'The secretary credited Trump with acting “aggressively” to pressure the Saudis and Russians to change course, adding that he can act even more aggressively if the situation calls for it.', '“The president has said very, very clearly that he will not allow any type of predatory activity on U.S. markets,” he said. “So, you know, there are some in Congress who some felt that the actions (by Saudi Arabia and Russia), while maybe not intended to be affecting the shale industry in the United States, the practical effect is that it was and to the extent that it was, the president was going to react to that.” ', '“Now, I can suggest that, you know, it wasn’t intentional,” Brouillette added. “If it was intentional then the president can act even more aggressively. And as I said, he will leave every option on the table and is unafraid to use it.”', 'The secretary did not elaborate as to what the president could do in terms of more aggressive measures, but lawmakers had previously suggested anti-dumping legislation and even sanctions. ', 'Some energy industry experts, however, cast doubt on the U.S.’s ability to affect Saudi Arabia or Russia’s actions on its own. IHS Markit vice chairman and longtime industry veteran Dan Yergin told CNBC in a March interview that aside from diplomacy, Washington “doesn’t have a lot of tools to address this.”', 'Brouillette added that he’d “like to work with Congress to see if we might expand the storage capacity” of the U.S.’s strategic petroleum reserves to make it more available for domestic industry storage and enable the country to “sell when it’s high, buy when it’s low.”', 'U.S. law authorizes up to 1 billion barrels of storage in the strategic reserves, so any expansion would require congressional approval, but “I’ll be working closely with them to do exactly that,” Brouillette said.']"
7,Iran’s President-elect Raisi rules out meeting Biden as oil markets look to nuclear deal’s future,2021-06-21T16:44:46+0000,"['DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iranian President-elect Ebrahim Raisi gave his first press conference since the country’s election, saying Monday his priorities would be to improve ties with regional neighbors and revive the 2015 nuclear deal — and at the same time squarely ruling out meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden.  “We support the negotiations that guarantee our national interests. … America should immediately return to the deal and fulfill its obligations under the deal,” Raisi, the hardline cleric who is himself under U.S. sanctions, said according to a Reuters translation. ', 'The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs to its nuclear program.', 'The JCPOA, brokered by the Obama administration, lifted sanctions on Iran that had crippled its economy and cut its oil exports roughly in half. In exchange for billions of dollars in sanctions relief, Iran agreed to dismantle some of its nuclear program and open its facilities to more extensive international inspections.', 'Alongside the United States, France, Germany, the U.K., Russia and China \u2060were also signatories of the agreement.', 'In 2018, then-President Donald Trump kept a campaign promise and unilaterally withdrew the United States from the JCPOA calling it the “worst deal ever.” Trump also reintroduced sanctions on Tehran that had been previously lifted.', 'Following Washington’s exit from the landmark nuclear deal, other signatories of the pact \u2060have struggled to keep the agreement alive. ', 'When asked at the White House on Monday, press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the position of the Biden administration had not changed since the U.S. does not have diplomatic relations with Tehran.', '“Well, we don’t currently have  diplomatic relations with Iran and we don’t have plans to meet at the leader level,” Psaki said. “The Iran nuclear negotiation teams just finished six rounds of talks and have not yet announced the seventh round,” she said, adding the administrations is hopeful for a path forward. ', 'Tehran has since ramped up its nuclear activity far beyond the deal’s limits in what it says is a protest against the sanctions — sanctions that Washington says it will not lift until Iran reverses its increased nuclear activity, such as increased uranium enrichment and stockpiling. ', 'And despite ongoing negotiations between JCPOA signatories in Vienna and talk of “progress,” the two adversaries still appear to be at a stalemate on major sticking points, such as Iran’s transparency with nuclear inspectors. ', 'Markets are now watching the talks and Raisi’s messages to glean what this might mean for the world’s supply of oil. ', 'Iran’s oil exports were slashed to a mere fraction of what they once were as a result of Trump’s sanctions. A revival of the deal and lifting of the levies could bring back 3.8 million barrels per day of oil to the market over time from a current 2.1 million bpd, Iranian oil ministry officials say. But that could be a long process due to underinvestment in oilfields and its recent years of reduced output. ', 'The deal “if revitalised, would provide a substantial lift to Iran’s economy — it could plausibly expand by 8-10% per year in 2021-23,” Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at London-based consultancy Capital Economics, wrote in a note before the election. But he added that its higher crude production would pressure other dynamics in the region. ', '“Higher Iranian oil output would act as a drag on global oil prices and could prompt governments in the Gulf countries to keep fiscal policy tight, weighing on their recoveries,” Tuvey said. ', 'If and once Iran is able to return to the global oil market, there won’t be any shortage of demand for it, according to Herman Wang, senior oil writer at Platts. ', '“Many of Iran’s former oil customers, particularly in Asia, have said they are eager to resume buying, as soon as they get the sanctions all-clear,” Wang said. He added that many of Asia’s refineries are well-suited to Iranian crudes, “which would add competition for neighboring Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Oman and other producers of heavier, sourer grades, and Iranian condensate would vie with similar condensates produced by Qatar, the U.S. and Australia.” ', '“This could well put pressure on oil prices, though OPEC and its allies will be hoping that rising demand will mean a bigger pie for everyone,” Wang added.', '“At this stage we’re still watching the negotiations among JCPOA parties in Vienna as the more significant variable for oil prices in the near term,” Ed Bell, director of commodities research at Dubai-based bank Emirates NBD, told CNBC.', 'Despite Raisi’s signal that he would support a deal, “that doesn’t address the differences that still exist among JCPOA parties, including the fact that Raisi himself is under U.S. sanctions,” he said.', '“The timeline for a return of freely exportable Iranian crude keeps getting pushed back later into 2021 and as such we don’t see any imminent return that would help to alleviate the tightness currently in the market,” Bell added.', 'The oil market doesn’t seem too bothered by the prospect of a revived deal; international benchmark Brent crude continued its steady upward climb on Monday, trading at $74.65 a barrel at noon ET, up 45% year to date and up 70% from this time last year. ', 'A more pressing longer-term issue, Bell said, would be how a Raisi administration positions its relationship within OPEC and its oil-producing allies. Would Iran accept a production quota if sanctions are lifted, or would it try to maximize its market share to compensate for lost time?', '“While Iran on its own wouldn’t be enough to push oil markets back into surplus this year, a race for market share could push other members of OPEC+ to do the same and risk putting downward pressure on oil prices,” Bell said.', 'CNBC’s Amanda Macias contributed to this report from Washington.']"

He added that the industry envisions changes to existing regulations following a carbon price policy endorsement.', 'Some environmental groups see it as an industry ploy to offer a solution to the carbon problem and stay engaged in the debate.', 'David Doniger, climate and clean energy program director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the move reminds him of the maxim that it’s better to be at the table than on the menu.', '“This is an effort to get to the table, rather than be overlooked and run roughshod, but it’s not very definite yet. I don’t know what they’re offering to really support,” Doniger said.', 'The NRDC also said it opposes removing strong pollution or efficiency regulations in exchange for a price on carbon.', '“That’s like the old Wimpy with the hamburgers: I’ll gladly have a hamburger today and pay you back next Tuesday,” Doniger said. “We’re not interested in trading one or more of the existing tools.”']"

Before Monday, many thought this was impossible. Maybe, just maybe, it could drop to zero, effectively erasing all value. But negative territory seemed unimaginable, not least because it’s hard even to wrap one’s mind around it. Pay someone to take your oil?', 'Yet that’s exactly what happened. “It was a take-your-breath-away kind of scary moment,” said Rebecca Babin, managing director at CIBC Private Wealth Management. “It truly was like watching … a full speed train wreck. But you couldn’t stop watching.”', 'The coronavirus pandemic has sapped as much as a third of worldwide demand for oil, according to some estimates. Producers have continued to pump, but with air travel halted and people staying home there’s simply nowhere for this oil to go. Refiners certainly don’t want it. And worldwide storage — both onshore and offshore — is quickly filling up. Analysts warn that we could reach tank tops, or maximum capacity, in a matter of weeks.', 'Everything came to a head on Monday. WTI has a physical settlement, meaning that as the monthly contract reaches expiration, whoever holds the contract is due a physical barrel of oil. Traders, in an effort to profit from the differential, buy and sell contracts without any intention of holding them at expiration, while refiners and airlines are among those on the other side who actually want the oil.', 'The contract that plunged into negative territory was for May delivery. Demand isn’t expected to rebound any time soon. And with nowhere to put the oil, people were left scrambling and ultimately would do anything — in this case, even pay — to have it taken off their hands.', 'There are nuances, of course. For one, the May contract expired on Tuesday, meaning that trading volume was thin as it plunged into negative territory. By that point the contract for June delivery was much more actively traded and thus a better indication of where the Street viewed oil prices.', 'Negative prices themselves are also not completely without precedent. Natural gas, for instance, has traded below zero in the past, and in the physical market certain regional grades of crude were already trading in negative territory prior to Monday. And there were some traders who warned that, as storage filled, prices would continue to decline dramatically.', 'But it was still shocking, nonetheless, to watch the downward descent on Monday of the world’s most actively traded oil contract.', '“This is an industry that I’ve been a part of for a long time now, and when it gets broken like that, or you get a really bad situation like that, it draws all kinds of unwanted attention and people getting hurt,” said Again Capital founding partner John Kilduff.', 'When the futures market opened at 6 p.m. ET on Sunday night, the WTI contract for May delivery traded at $17.73, or about 3% below its Friday settle price of $18.27. Oil was coming off its sixth straight day of losses, and its seventh negative week in eight. The nearly 20% decline for the week was especially notable since, only days before, OPEC and its oil-producing allies had agreed to a historic production cut that would take 9.7 million barrels per day — roughly 10% of global supply — offline. It wasn’t enough to assuage investor fears.', 'It turned out that $17.73 would be just a few cents shy of Monday’s high. By midnight eastern time WTI was trading in the $15 range. Selling continued in overnight trading, and at 8 a.m. prices had slipped to $11. Just after noon, prices dropped into the single digits.', '“It was like watching a really bad traffic accident unfold right in front of you,” said Kilduff, who’s been in the energy industry for more than 25 years. “You knew there was going to be damage, even if it was thinly traded. … You knew somebody was on the other side of those trades, and you kind of got a little bit of a sick feeling.”', 'After prices entered the single digits, there would be no going back. At 1:51 p.m., WTI broke below $1, and at 2:08 p.m., less than a half hour before the settle, it fell into negative territory.

Ultimately, the contract settled at negative $37.63.', 'That prices kept falling deeper into negative territory after crossing zero is what most surprised RBN Energy CEO Rusty Braziel.', '“That’s what freaked everybody, was the fact that these guys were in such dire circumstances,” he said. “There was not a single soul that I have talked to that came anywhere close to predicting what happened.”', 'Braziel has been in the energy industry for decades, first as a trader and now as a consultant. While trading, he experienced his fair share of volatility — including the 1986 crash that sent oil prices tumbling below $10.', 'The heavy selling on Monday, rather than Tuesday when the contract was set to expire, was also notable, he said.', 'By Tuesday’s opening bell the May contract was back in positive territory, and steadily climbed higher to settle at $10.01. But it was the lowest settle on record — apart from Monday’s plunge — since the contract’s inception in 1983. For context, the previous “lowest ever” title was held by the $10.42 settle on March 31, 1986.', '“The fact that there wasn’t going to be enough storage and that things could get really hairy around expiration was not a surprise,” said Babin. “But to the degree that it happened, and the speed that it happened, it was actually kind of scary.”', 'Part of Monday’s historic fall was certainly technical, as the financial and physical worlds collided. The volume was thin, and the majority of professional traders and funds that hold these contracts had likely already rolled their positions into later contracts. On Monday the June contract held steady above $20.', 'Despite that, the drop into negative prices cannot be dismissed as merely a glitch. For one, it shows the depths of the imbalance between supply and demand wrought by the coronavirus outbreak. “To put a fine point on the horrible economic situation we’re in right now with this pandemic, it was Monday’s trading,” Kilduff said.', 'It also shines light on the fact that zero doesn’t necessarily provide a floor for prices. Losses can be limitless in futures.', 'Brent crude, the international benchmark, has held up slightly better than WTI, since it prices in the North Sea — which affords it easier access to storage — as opposed to landlocked Cushing, Oklahoma, where WTI prices. “Slightly” is the operative word here, however, since Brent is hovering around a more than 20-year low. And WTI’s Friday settle price of $16.94 is hardly something to celebrate. At the beginning of the year it traded above $60. Less than six years ago it topped $100.', 'With prices this low, at a certain point producers will be forced to turn off the taps. A number of companies including Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips have already announced production cuts, and additional cuts are expected.', 'The consequences could be especially severe for U.S. companies, since shale oil is harder to extract from the ground and therefore more expensive to produce.

Look out below.  ', 'The move by the Saudis is both a market share grab and a loud signal to Moscow that it’s done playing games.  The dramatic action is in response to a contentious, and ultimately failed, OPEC meeting in Austria on Friday. OPEC members laid out a proposal to further cut oil output quotas by as much as 1.5 million barrels per day.

A source inside the negotiations tells me that as the two sides worked out production cut plans, in the end the “red lines weren’t even close.” The source added that the Russians “definitely don’t want to continue to support shale” at least in part because the Rosneft sanctions were still “too raw.”', 'It was only three weeks ago that the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Russian oil giant Rosneft for transporting Venezuelan oil.

Put another way: economically, Italy is trying to lock down the output of California, Oregon and Washington states combined. For a month.  ', 'Could that happen here in the states?  Unlikely, but there is a real risk of a sharp economic hit, as travel slows and people are asked to work from home.  As the world’s biggest consumer, we use about 20 million barrels of oil per day.

', 'An energy executive, who didn’t wish to be named, told me by phone Sunday that in his view, every industry CEO needs to come out tomorrow and say that they are shutting down all new drilling activity, cutting CapEx, slicing dividends and aggressively trying to reduce output. ', 'It sounds extreme, but his point was that unless U.S. production comes down by a few million barrels per day, fast, oil could easily fall into the $20s, which would crush the value of in-ground reserves that serve as the basis for so much debt collateral in the industry.  Banks will realize it no longer makes sense to operate a business with hugely negative cash flow.

The fund likely had already sold those contracts for the June oil futures, but the fall to negative prices sent a chill through the whole oil market. June oil futures then began plummeting this week as well and traders feared they would turn negative. ', 'This caused the fund to implement a series of changes beginning last Friday. The fund, originally set up to invest in just the front-month contract until two weeks before expiration, said it would now invest funds in futures expiring months out. It also suspended the making of creation baskets, which is how an ETF makes new shares to meet demand. The creation baskets buy the futures. But by suspending this mechanism this week, the fund began to trade as a closed-end fund with a fixed number of shares. This also meant it could no longer accurately track the price of oil.

As supply remained steady while demand struck record-breaking lows, the industry quickly began running out of storage space to put their oil. This was devastating news for investors of WTI futures who are expected to take physical possession of the oil when the contract expires.', '“WTI is special in a way because it’s so tightly connected to physical oil,” said Derrick Morgan, senior vice president of American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers. ', 'As the delivery date for WTI grew near, investors began a massive sell-off to take the contract off their hands, prompting an unprecedented crash into the negative territory.', 'The historic drop quickly sent shock waves through the U.S. financial market. The Dow plunged by over 1,200 points over the following two days and brokerage firms took multimillion-dollar hits to cover customers’ losses. However, experts point out that although the event was unprecedented, there was no need to panic. “There were very few contracts. There was very little trading at those prices and the price very quickly rebounded into positive territory,” according to Borenstein.', 'Experts think the impact of the turbulent prices will likely be more severe for the U.S. shale industry, which is often in heavy debt due to its high production costs.']"

42,Kelly Evans: Nat gas is the new oil,2021-10-06T19:56:17+0000,"['If the 20th century was the era of oil, is natural gas the key fuel of the 21st?  ', 'One reason why nat gas prices continue their parabolic spike right now is that it’s the easiest replacement for coal as countries are under pressure to reduce emissions and, in China’s case, deliver on their promise of “blue skies.” Which is to say that unlike oil, which powers transportation, natural gas provides electricity--it literally keeps the lights on, and it provides heat for schools, businesses, and roughly 40% of U.S. homes.  ', 'And in fact, electricity itself is also now a substitute for driving fuels like gasoline. So if we were dependent before on natural gas, we’ll be extra dependent now, since nat gas also powers around 40% of the U.S. electric grid. Every EV sold today that isn’t 100% powered by renewables will increase demand for natural gas at the expense of oil. Think about the massive global implications of that! Roughly 20% of cars sold in China as of August were already EVs. In Germany last month, that hit 29% (including plug-in hybrids)! ', 'Point being, oil demand looks set to peak before natural gas demand will, and oil is much easier to substitute. All you have to do is drive an EV and, at least in the U.S., your household demand for gasoline disappears overnight (okay, except for the lawn mower). This is why the likes of oil trader Pierre Andurand expect oil demand to peak by around 2027--if not sooner, now that oil prices are back up to around $80 a barrel. The last time oil prices were this high, in late 2014, Exxon was one of the world’s most valuable companies and shares were trading in the $90s. Today, its shares are around $60, it’s been kicked out of the Dow, and its market cap is a third of Tesla’s.  ', 'Substituting away from natural gas is a tougher challenge--it’s literally piped into my house. Google “how to replace natural gas heat” and you have some options like using electric heat pumps, or, as many who live in the country already know, propane, but they’re not that feasible for much of the dense U.S. population. The country is likely to rely on nat gas for heat for awhile, even as renewables continue to make inroads in powering the electric grid. The situation in Europe is even worse, as their nat gas production has plunged, nuclear is being phased out, and they’re left relying on German pipelines or vying for global LNG shipments and being outbid by Asia right now. ', 'Cannily, Russia anticipated all this. Lest their geopolitical power be undermined by falling demand for oil, the country has quickly become a top natural gas supplier and now a crucial one for Europe. Just this morning, European natural gas prices were soaring again--to the tune of 40% in the U.K.--when Russia finally stepped in, reportedly promising to increase shipments, and prices reversed lower.  ', 'And in the longer run, the U.S., which is also one of the “big four” global producers, along with Qatar and Australia, should be able to step in and fill the supply gap. It’s exactly why natural gas prices have been frustratingly low for producers and investors in the space for the last decade. And it’s why our prices, while they’ve doubled from a year ago, are still a fraction of what Europe is paying. What’s more, the U.S. trade balance and GDP should hugely benefit from global demand for our liquefied nat gas exports.  ', 'The real problem comes if both investors and policymakers push harder to move away from U.S. nat gas production. If nothing else, this winter should be a reminder of the perils of doing so.

It predicts upside risks to Brent crude forecasts of $32 per barrel and WTI at $28 per barrel by the end of the second quarter. ', 'Looking into 2021, forecasts become more bullish.

The May and June contracts remained under serious pressure Tuesday as the more actively traded June contract fell nearly 25%.', 'In the days leading up to the historic plunge, the United States Oil Fund (USO) — the market’s largest crude oil ETF by assets — saw notably higher trading volumes as short- and long-term buyers sought to express their views on crude, ETF analysts told CNBC on Monday.', 'Some market watchers criticized USO for playing a role in the implosion in oil prices given its sizable, roughly 25% position in the May futures contracts. But Mike Akins, founding partner of ETF Action, told CNBC’s “ETF Edge” on Monday that likely wasn’t the case.', '“It’s important to note that USO is no longer in the May contract. USO’s methodology is to roll out of their contracts two weeks prior to expiration, so, actually, they rolled out of May into June the week of April 7,” Akins said. “So, with respect to what’s going on currently with ... that huge disconnect between the price of May contracts and June contracts, it is not directly related to USO even though USO ... does own a significant percentage of contracts of the month they’re currently holding.”', 'Akins was more concerned about how buyers might interpret the spike in USO’s trading volumes. The increase was evidenced by higher share creation in the fund, which is when an ETF issues new blocks of shares to sell on the open market.', '“I think it’s important to point out to the audience that, historically ... the price of USO has been an inverse relationship to the shares outstanding. That meaning that as price goes down, shares outstanding have historically gone up and vice versa. And the rationale for that is because [of] the demand,” Akins said.', '“As volatility increases in the price of oil, the demand for this product goes up,” he said. “But it’s very important not to use that as a way to assume that people are getting long the price of oil, because these strategies, these are trading tools. They’re not allocation tools alone. And as a result, as you mentioned, flows don’t dictate the position of the actual traders.”', 'In short, if you’re interested in buying shares of something like USO in such a volatile time for the underlying commodity, it’s important to know what you own and understand the risk, Akins said.', 'You may be a long-term investor, but in times of heightened uncertainty, there could be people short selling, or betting against, the very same ETF you’re holding, he warned.', '“I always say, with respect to these trading tools, there’s a lot of tools at Home Depot I can buy that I have no business using. And that’s very important to note, that a lot of these ETFs, you can buy them, but you need to really understand them before you start using them,” he said.', 'Bryon Lake, head of Americas ETF distribution at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, echoed Akins’ sentiments in the same “ETF Edge” interview.', '“First of all, this is a really efficient way for investors to express a view. And so, if they’re able to use this ETF to express that view, that’s a tool that is helpful to their portfolio,” Lake said.', '“The second thing is, just taking it back to a little bit of history here and why the futures contracts were invented in the first place, it’s next to impossible to get spot price or to store oil. It’s very expensive,” he said. “In fact, I was Googling it earlier [Monday]: I think a used oil tanker is about $42 million right now and you can only hold about 2 million barrels of oil on that. So, you create a futures contract in order to give yourself the ability to get the exposure or hedge your exposure or your risk within your portfolios.”', 'When packaged in the ETF structure, that can become “a helpful tool for investors to express their views,” Lake said. “They just need to make sure they understand how they work.”', 'USO fell almost 18% to a new all-time low of just above $3 a share.', 'Disclaimer']"

', '“Concurrent drawdowns of both crude and refined products are a big tailwind heading into spring,” he told CNBC. “It’s not just positive sentiment; the roughly 40 million barrels lost due to the storm help tighten the market.”', 'The inventory drawdown continues a trend that’s seeing oil prices steadily rise from their historic pandemic-induced lows nearly a year ago. Brent crude is up 30% year to date, with Goldman Sachs predicting it could hit $75 by the end of this year, a level not seen since fall of 2018.  ', 'This could influence decision making among OPEC members in their upcoming meeting on March 4. While the organization had prioritized production cuts during much of the pandemic to keep a floor under oil prices, the more promising outlook for demand — and gradually normalizing global supply — provides incentive for these producers to speed up the rate at which they’ll increase their production.   ', '“I would certainly expect Saudi Arabia to boost production given the current prices that the market has seen,” said Yousef Alshammari, CEO at oil markets consultancy firm CMarkets.', '“Supply disruption in Texas may lead to OPEC+ and Saudi Arabia to raise production by a certain extent and much of that production rise will go to exports at higher prices.” OPEC+ is the loose alliance of 13 OPEC states and 10 non-OPEC oil-producing countries.  ', 'Saudi Arabia’s voluntary production cuts of 1 million barrels per day ends in March, and is already expected to start gradually bringing back supply in April. But that also means the kingdom can’t take advantage of higher crude prices by ramping up exports until that production cut period ends. ', 'Still, “every oil producer, including Saudi Arabia, enjoys the benefit of” the price increase, said Tamas Varga, senior analyst at PVM Oil Associates. “U.S. crude oil exports will fall in coming weeks and this provides support for international grades — again supportive for oil producers.”', 'Some analysts don’t see the Texas output loss as consequential, even in the medium term. ', 'The impact of a 4 million barrel daily loss “is very small on a global basis as the world produces over 80 million barrels per day of oil,” Rene Santos, manager for North America supply at S&P Global Platts Analytics, told CNBC.“Freeze-offs happen in the U.S. every year but of the magnitude that we experienced in the past few days does not happen very often,” he said. “In addition, freeze-offs are short-lived.”', 'PVM’s Varga agrees. “The situation will likely normalize soon and in the medium-term the impact of the Texas freeze will be negligible, I think,” he said.', 'But the longer-term market dynamic is still in OPEC members’ favor — not because of Texas’ storm, but thanks to last year’s devastating oil production shut-ins across the U.S. when crude prices crashed. The high cost of U.S. shale production meant most producers couldn’t survive the impact of the lockdowns. U.S. rig count is still 50% below 2019 levels, despite climbing prices. ', '“U.S. oil production is not expected to rebound to 2019 levels which will leave OPEC+ with much more influence on the markets in 2021,” Alshammari said. ', 'Over the long term, the impact from a weather shock like this month’s “really depends on how Texas will deal with such crises in the future,” he added. “I expect them to be more resilient to such adverse weather conditions on the upstream supply side, yet I certainly expect Saudi Arabia to have a bigger market share in the long run due to the lost market share from shale production.”']"

', '“As the smoke clears, that’s the number one question of the markets today — anyone who thinks that the technicals are behind the pricing yesterday is going to completely miss the point,” Dave Ernsberger, global head of commodities pricing for S&P Global Platts, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Tuesday.  ', '“That storage is just as full for June, if not fuller, than it was for May. Already Cushing is 70% or 80% full, and that technically means it’s closed for business. So we could easily see this play into the June contract pretty soon.”   ', 'Cushing, Oklahoma, is a critical oil storage hub and delivery point for American oil traded on futures markets.

The negative May contract — which later turned positive to surpass $2 but fell back to less than negative $3 during London’s morning trading hours — was hit harder as it expires on Tuesday, meaning it’s seeing less trading activity as it’s set for delivery while economies around the world remain in full lockdown mode. The spread between May and June contracts was the largest in history.', 'Still, trying to make money buying into oil businesses on the hopes of improved prices in June is a complete gamble, Ernsberger warned.  ', '“There’s an eight-week danger zone here between today and sometime in June — where between now and then, anybody who thinks oil has found a floor is playing with fire and trying to catch the famous falling knife, because it’s almost impossible to call,” he said.', 'While the spread between WTI and global oil benchmark Brent crude is at one of its widest levels ever, with Brent trading at a nearly two-decade low of $19.80 per barrel Tuesday morning London time, increasingly flooded inventories will be “likely dragging Brent prices lower as well,” said Edward Bell, commodities analyst at Dubai-based Emirates NBD.  ', 'Ernsberger agrees. While Brent storage is more commonly on floating tankers and can move around the world, in contrast to much of the American crude that’s stuck in landlocked pipelines in the heart of the U.S., he says other producer countries “need to look over their shoulder because Brent is not far behind, other crude benchmarks are not far behind, and the world is running out of storage.” ', '“Our estimates are the total inventory in the world could be exceeded by the end of May, beginning of June.” ', 'Bell said that while it’s a “natural reaction for prices to push into negative territory” in this context of crushed demand, the markets “need a sharp supply response for prices to normalize at a positive level. Storage as an alternative to consumption is actually also full, so that’s not offering anything. The potential for prices to go lower is very likely.”', 'A historic 9.7 million barrel per day oil cut agreed by OPEC and many other oil producing nations will come into play in May and could help put a floor under prices, though whether it will take effect before global storage runs out is yet to be seen. ', 'For American producers, “the next logical step will be shut-ins and bankruptcies,” Louise Dickson, oil market analyst at Rystad Energy, wrote in an email note Monday. “If these materialize in the next month, then we can begin discussing optimism in June, but right now, given the likely low compliance of OPEC+ cuts by May 1, the optimism is not yet warranted, and we could see a repeat situation next month.”']"

There are, however, two other happenings right now which are wonky but important and could send oil prices down in a hurry.', 'First, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange recently raised its margin requirements for forward oil contracts. The June contract now requires margin of $10,000.  Given that each contract is 1,000 barrels of oil, simple math tells us that $10 per barrel is a key level to watch in trading.  Should crude fall under the $10 mark, it could trigger margin calls.

This time last year, drivers were using about 9.2 million barrels a day of gasoline. U.S. gasoline demand translates to the equivalent of 10% of global oil demand.', '“Right now, we have a supply problem and a demand problem. That is unprecedented,” said Helima Croft, head of global commodities strategy at RBC.', 'RBC expects that U.S. gasoline demand could ultimately fall by 6.2 million barrels a day as more states require citizens to shelter in place and many U.S. drivers remain off the road through at least the end of April to fight the spread of coronavirus.', ' In the past week, the U.S. also added another 13.8 million barrels of oil to inventories, a record amount, which only exacerbates the global struggle with a lack of storage space. U.S. gasoline inventories rose by 7.5 million barrels last week. West Texas Intermediate was down 1.3% Wednesday, at just over $20 per barrel.', 'This has come even as many in the U.S. industry struggle to stay solvent.  Whiting Petroleum this week became the first high-profile shale bankruptcy of the latest downturn. In response to the falloff in gasoline and jet fuel demand, the refining industry has cut output by an estimated 20% and could cut back much deeper.', 'It also has raised the question of whether the U.S. industry could be required to curb production to stave off more damage in the sector. The Texas Railroad Commission was asked by Pioneer Natural Resources and Parsley Energy to consider curtailing crude output in Texas, as the industry deals with collapsing prices and the drop in demand. OPEC has invited the commission to its June meeting.', 'Such an effort would be widely debated and could be seen as unsavory in Washington as some officials worry about antitrust and other considerations of regulating the U.S. industry.

The world is seeing much less need for oil, as governments in Europe, India and elsewhere shutdown activity, even as China’s demand recovers.', '“It takes time to idle rigs, and things like that, but this speaks to what the Russians said was unsustainable. They were asked to make ever-growing numbers of cuts, while the U.S. continued to climb,” Croft said. “Having an OPEC plus agreement, we would still have a huge demand problem, but we’d no longer be putting water in the bath tub.”', 'The U.S. industry has managed to continue near-record production, and unlike other producing nations, output is dictated by economics at individual companies rather than government control.', 'However, the arrival of oil majors into the shale fields with their higher tolerance for price turbulence and the improvements in U.S. technology has permitted shale oil to keep flowing even as some smaller companies are on the brink of failure. ', 'Analysts say U.S. production could be seeing a lagged effect, and it should ultimately come down sharply. Last week, the U.S. shut down 44 rigs, and was operating 728, down 278 in the last year, according to Baker Hughes. ', 'U.S. production offshore had also grown in the past year, and that is the last type of production the industry will shut down. So it will come down to shale to curb output, and the economics of a $20 per barrel West Texas Intermediate oil price are already showing up in layoffs in the oil fields.  ', 'The refining industry will also feel more pain, and contribute to the drop in U.S. demand.', 'According to RBC, U.S. refinery runs could fall by four to eight million barrels a day, but larger cuts in the 50 to 65% are requited to structurally balance the market.']"

International Brent crude futures were up 3.6% at about $68.67 per barrel. While oil backed off the day’s highs, oil analysts expect the price to remain volatile and slightly elevated with the potential to move much higher, if there are further actions.', '“I think we’re in unchartered waters,” said Helima Croft, head of RBC global commodities strategy. “This is not a run-of-the-mill general being assassinated. This is where it becomes really challenging for the market. I don’t think this is a one off. You may have a reprisal. It may be quiet for a period, then there could be another incident.”', 'Analysts say Iran’s unpredictability and web of proxies, like Hezbollah, creates an unmeasurable risk factor for the price of oil that the market is not reflecting, and it makes for an even bigger wild card because Iran can operate through them like a rogue nation.', 'Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Soleimani’s work will not end, and “severe revenge” awaits those who were responsible for his death. Analysts say Iran’s retaliation could be aimed at oil or military facilities, or even come as cyberattacks', '“The Iranians can’t lose face over this. They have to do something,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital. He expects the upper range for WTI crude to be $70 per barrel, and Brent to be $80 to $85 per barrel. “There’s still a big cushion and a ton of spare capacity in Saudi Arabia. We’re not in the dire tightly supplied market we were in a few years ago.”', 'Iran’s economy has been severely damaged by U.S. financial sanctions and an oil sales ban, and as pressures intensified, attacks blamed on Iran or its proxies have increased.', 'Tankers have been attacked in the Strait of Hormuz, but the most stunning and shocking incident was the attack on Abqaiq and Khurais in Saudi Arabia, in September that temporarily knocked out 5.7 million barrels a day of Saudi Aramco production.', 'It was the first major attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities and a wake-up call on a potential vulnerability, but the kingdom was able to make up for the shortfall by using its own reserves as it repaired the facilities.The price of oil rose briefly after the Aramco attack but quickly backed down after the impact on world oil supply looked to be minor.', 'There was also a muted market reaction In May of last year, when four commercial ships anchored in the United Arab Emirates were hit by explosive charges causing large holes in their hulls, just above the waterline. Then a month later, two more oil tankers were attacked by what were widely believed to be limpet mines, explosives that are attached to the hull of a ship with a powerful magnet. Those attacks happened in the Gulf of Oman just outside of the Persian Gulf.', 'Iran never claimed responsibility for any of the attacks. The Islamic Republic is also believed to be responsible for several cyberattacks in Saudi Arabia including one targeting petrochemical plants in the kingdom in January 2017.

The question is, what is the tipping point?” said Croft.', 'Kilduff said it’s hard to tell when Iran will strike back, as it has been deliberate in its attacks and is not always the apparent perpetrator. “I unfortunately think think Iraq is going to be the battleground. There will be a ton of mischief. You could see Iraq oil production in the cross hairs,” he said.', 'It was Iraq, where Soleimani was believed to be organizing further attacks on U.S. personnel and assets after an attack on U.S. forces in Kirkuk last week. During the past week, the U.S. Embassy was under siege in Baghdad by protesters who supported an Iranian-backed militia.', '“It’s the theater where you could have this type of confrontation between the U.S. and Iran. This situation remains very volatile, very fluid and the Iraqi government is caught between the U.S. and Iran,” said Croft. There were recent protests in Iraq against Iran’s involvement in Iraq’s affairs.', '“I think they’re tired of Iranian backed groups that have siphoned off government revenue and oil revenue. It’s not like Americans are adored either. They are a reminder of the Iraq war and occupation. One of the biggest risks is the operations of U.S. companies in Iraq,” she said.', '', 'Dan Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit, said Soleimani’s importance cannot be understated, as he masterminded the patchwork of terror proxies across the Middle East. He also had once been in the shadows but has more recently had celebrity status in Iran.', '“He was the author of mayhem. You could already see there was rising tension,” said Yergin. Souleimani was also one of the most important people in the region and used his proxies to make sure Bashar al-Assad of Syria remained in power.', '“You also would take seriously what they said in the Defense Department statement. They may well have had knowledge that Soleimani was playing for the end game which was to force the U.S. out of Iraq,” Yergin said.', 'Henry Rome, Iran analyst with Eurasia Group, expects retaliation by Iran, but he sees only a 40% chance of all out war.', '“Iranian leaders are proud and quite risk acceptant. We expect moderate to low level clashes to last for at least a month and likely be confined to Iraq,” he wrote. “Iran will also likely resume harassment of commercial shipping in the Gulf and may launch military exercises to temporarily disrupt shipping. Finally, it will respond in asymmetric ways that we cannot predict, akin to the Iran-backed attack in 1992 against a Jewish community center in Argentina. Beyond retaliation, Iran’s ultimate goal in Iraq is to make continued American presence unviable.”', 'Rome says that Iran is not likely to attack Saudi Arabia or oil infrastructure in the Emirates, and it should stay away from the U.S. bases in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, or Qatar. “These steps would have the effect of unifying the Gulf against Tehran; Iran will instead target its ire against Washington in the near term,” Rome wrote. “The Iranian actions will stop short of what we would consider war.”', 'Iraq, if it is in the firing line, is a big target for the oil market, and it is OPEC’s second largest producer, pumping about 4.6 million barrels a day. That is close to the record 4.5 million barrels exported by the U.S. last week, according to U.S. government data. It was the first time exports surpassed 4 million barrels a day.', 'Unlike the geopolitical-related oil surges during previous tense periods in the Middle East, the price now may not inflate as much as it may have because of the growth of U.S. oil output in the last decade. The U.S. is now the world’s top producer, pumping 12.9 million barrels a day.', 'Yergin said oil prices have been responding more to trade matters than geopolitics recently, and that could change with the approach of the signing of the phase one trade deal between the U.S. and China. Trade worries had been outweighing other factors before the U.S. and China signaled a deal was close at hand. The concern was that the trade war would hurt demand globally, and there is a better market for oil and other commodities if tensions remain at bay.', '“Shale has changed the psychology of the world oil market,” he said. Growth in U.S. production has been rapid, with more than 1 million barrels added this year, but that growth could slow. The U.S. growth spurt has also helped mitigate the impact of the loss of oil output from both Iran and Venezuela, also under U.S. sanctions.', '“I think we’re not going to see the kind of volumetric increases of the last few years. This year, we expect the U.S. will add about 400,000 to 450,000 barrels a day. Capital discipline is going to put a big cap on production of shale. The U.S.is still going to be a 13 million barrel a day plus producer. This production is not going away,” said Yergin.', 'The U.S. has changed the oil market, but it could still remain elevated because of uncertainty which may not go away for some time.', '“There are times when the geopolitical risk premium is inflated and other times it’s nonexistent. It’s getting inflated again,” said Kilduff.', 'However, Ed Morse, Citigroup head of commodities research, says that could be temporary.', 'He said there could be attacks by Iran in the near-term but ultimately the situation could be bearish for the oil market if it ends in Iran and the U.S. ultimately negotiating a new deal on Iran’s nuclear program.', '“Despite clear short-term oil market concerns, there could be bearish factors at work later in 2020, with the possibility that Iran and the US could find common purpose in working out a new agreement,” Morse wrote in a note. “The push and pull on politics in Iran have involved three different parties— the clerical establishment, elected officials in parliament and the administration, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and their Quds forces, whose leader has now been eliminated by US attacks. Of the three, the Quds forces have been the major target of US sanctions. They and the IRGC have been the one party least interested in a bilateral accord with the US.”', '— CNBC’s Jason Gewirtz contributed to this story.']"

The gain was due to broad-based price jumps in areas of basic needs for consumers — food, fuel and shelter — and it comes as the war between Russia and Ukraine rages on, continuing to drive energy prices higher. Some economists expect inflation to rise even more going forward.', 'But, even with the uncertainty surrounding the war, the Fed is expected to move forward with its first rate hike next week in a bid to curb inflation before it becomes too entrenched. The Fed took its fed funds target rate to zero in early 2020 to fight the pandemic.', 'However, the central bank also faces the risk that higher interest rates and high inflation — particularly from energy prices — could create a drag on growth. That means the central bank could have to slow the pace of hiking to prevent a recession.', 'Economists expect the Fed will raise interest rates as many as seven times this year. In the futures market, traders were betting Thursday on about six quarter-point hikes for the year. That could change once investors see what Fed officials forecast for interest rates, when they release their latest economic projections at the end of their policy meeting Wednesday afternoon.', 'The Fed’s first rate hike is expected to be a quarter-point, or 25 basis points. Each basis point equals 0.01 of a percentage point.', '“25 basis points next week seems just about a lock,” Wells Fargo director of rates strategy Michael Schumacher said. “The Fed’s in a tough spot. It’s getting tougher by the day. It’s hard any time, but especially when you’ve got incredible inflation, and we’ve had the supply chain issues for a while, and now they’ve been exacerbated by Russia-Ukraine.”', 'The closely watched U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2% on Thursday. That yield is important since it influences mortgages and other consumer and business loans. At the same time, stocks sold off.', '“You’re not seeing the typical risk off reaction. Equities are driven by Ukraine worries, and bonds are driven by inflation and Fed expectations,” Schumacher said. Bond yields move opposite price.', 'Meanwhile, gasoline in the past week has jumped by about 60 cents per gallon to an average $4.31 nationally, according to AAA. Oil is off its highs, but is still trading well above $100 per barrel.', 'Other commodities like wheat, palladium and nickel have also moved. Russia is a major commodities exporter, and sanctions on its financial sector by the U.S. and allies have created concerns about supply scarcity.', 'The Fed was under pressure from rising inflation to raise interest rates even before the Ukraine conflict sent the price of oil and raw materials higher. Supply chain disruptions were behind some rising prices, and a strong U.S. economy with solid growth and a healthy labor market was adding to pressures on prices.', 'Economists have downgraded U.S. growth expectations, but only slightly, and they do not expect a recession this year. Economists surveyed in the CNBC Rapid Update have an average growth forecast of 3.2% for 2022, down 0.3% from their February forecast.', '“With the demand side so strong, I think the Fed is stuck. The Fed focuses on core, but food was up 1% last month. That’s a huge number,” Schumacher said. Energy was the biggest contributor to price gains, up 3.5% for February, accounting for about a third of the headline gain.', 'Shelter, which includes rent, was up 0.5% for an annualized jump of 4.7%, the fastest increase since May 1991.', 'February’s core consumer inflation, excluding food and energy, was up 6.4% year over year.', '“March CPI will show a substantial 1-2% MoM increase in headline CPI due to higher food and energy prices, with some possible greater than usual pass through of higher energy costs to core inflation in components like transportation services,” Citigroup economists noted. “This next CPI release will come just ahead of the May FOMC meeting, when we expect a 50bp rate hike.”', 'Many economists expect the Fed to stick to quarter-point rate hikes. But Citi economists said the Fed could raise by 50 basis points at its May meeting after seeing the expected strong report for March. Inflation was expected to have peaked by March, but higher oil prices could mean rising prices could continue to soar.', '“We came into this with a lot of momentum. Oil price spikes don’t always cause recessions,” Grant Thornton chief economist Diane Swonk said. “The Fed has to hedge against what else it’s worried about. That is inflation expectations have been moving up. The Fed has to think about what are the chances of this inflation more entrenched like the 1970s. They are trying to avoid that at all costs.”', 'Swonk said the Fed was already behind the curve, and it needs to raise rates. She said headline CPI could easily reach 9% this spring before falling off.', 'Rising oil prices are a big concern for economists since they snake through the economy, hitting the consumer at the gas pump. The high prices are also generating higher input costs for things like chemicals, fertilizers, plastics and building products. They are also a drag on the transportation sector, as they drive diesel and jet fuel prices higher.', 'So oil prices could play a big part in the Fed’s decision making process. Economists are not currently forecasting super high oil prices, but they don’t rule out a higher spike.', '“I think if oil went to $150 and you saw some break in the data somewhere, they might skip May for a hike,” Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said. “They would presumably be thinking we’re seeing some deterioration in demand.”', 'Worries about stagflation have crept into the market.', '“We certainly have stagflation influences. Stagflation is literally rising inflation and rising unemployment. I don’t think that’s probable at this point. It’s certainly plausible. We certainly have stagflation influences,” Gapen said. “You would need the conflict to widen beyond its current context. Maybe that puts Europe into a recession and it would be hard for us to stay out of a recession.”', 'Gapen said the data would have to deteriorate for the Fed to slow its rate hikes. He expects five hikes, and the Fed is also expected to begin to pare down its roughly $9 trillion balance sheet this year, also a tightening move.', 'Swonk noted that the employment picture is solid. The 678,000 jobs added in February was especially strong, and the labor market continues to improve.', 'There are, however, other issues that could stop the Fed in its path to normalize rates.', 'Swonk said that if financial conditions became poor, with stocks selling sharply and credit markets freezing up, that could give the Fed pause. So far, there are no signs of major stress in financial markets from the Russian-Ukraine crisis.', '“What would stop the Fed is if we had a situation that really bled into credit markets. In a way, that creates worse inflation and it’s much harder to recover from a financial crisis. That’s why the Fed’s walking a tightrope,” she said.', '“They couldn’t have broadcast this more,” she said. “Jay Powell said we’re going to raise rates a quarter-point on March 16. That was as blunt as you could get. They’re on for that. They don’t want it to be a surprise.”', 'Swonk said it’s not clear what the Fed will forecasts about future rate hikes. “But they have to put in the caveat that we’ll be watching financial markets carefully,” she added.']"
