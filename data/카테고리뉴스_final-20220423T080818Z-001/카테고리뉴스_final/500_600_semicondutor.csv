That’s up from January’s forecast that estimated the shortage would cut production of 2.2 million vehicles.', 'In the U.S., the shortage has caused the Biden administration to order a 100-day review of U.S. supply chains. About $50 billion of President Joe Biden’s $2 trillion infrastructure proposal is also earmarked for the American semiconductor industry.', 'Automakers such as Ford Motor and General Motors expect massive earnings cuts this year due to the chip shortage. Ford said the situation will lower its earnings by about $2.5 billion in 2021. GM expects the chip shortage will cut its earnings by $1.5 billion to $2 billion.', 'Semiconductor chips are extremely important components of new vehicles for areas like infotainment systems and more basic parts such as power steering and brakes.

Intel said its foundry division will be called Intel Foundry Services and will be led by Randhir Thakur, a current Intel senior vice president.', 'Gelsinger said the foundry business will compete in a market potentially worth $100 billion by 2025 and will manufacture a range of chips, including chips based on ARM technology, which are used in mobile devices, and has historically competed with Intel’s favored x86 technology.', 'A slide displayed by Intel suggested that companies including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Qualcomm could be customers for the business. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella appeared at Gelsinger’s talk in a show of support for Intel’s move.', 'Intel’s commitment to manufacturing has national security implications.

In addition to its site in Arizona, which is being expanded, it also has fabs in Massachusetts, New Mexico and Oregon. It also makes chips in Ireland, Israel and has a single fab in China.', 'Intel’s foundry will offer a U.S. and Europe-based alternative to Asian chip factories.', 'In February, President Joe Biden said domestic semiconductor manufacturing is a priority for his administration. His administration hopes to fix going chip shortages and address lawmaker concerns that outsourcing chipmaking had made the U.S. more vulnerable to supply chain disruptions.', 'In an executive action, Biden started began a 100-day review that could boost American chip companies with additional government support and new policies.', '“Today’s Executive Order, combined with full funding for the CHIPS Act, can help level the playing field in the global competition for semiconductor manufacturing leadership, enabling American companies to compete on equal footing with foreign companies heavily subsidized by their governments,” Intel said at the time in response to the executive order.', 'Gelsinger took over Intel on Feb. 15 from former CEO Bob Swan. Although he was most recently the CEO of VMWare, he started his career at Intel and his appointment has been regarded as a homecoming.', 'He took over a company facing a variety of challenges. Intel had lost its semiconductor manufacturing edge to Asia-based rivals, most notably TSMC. Intel’s most advanced chips use a 14-nanometer or a 10-nanometer process. Intel both designs the chips, then makes them in its own factories, called fabs.', 'But competitors, including Intel customers like Apple and rivals like AMD, just design the processor, then have it manufactured by an outside chip factory. These chip factories, like TSMC and Samsung, use a more advanced 5-nanometer process, which is superior because more transistors can fit in the same sized chip, boosting power and efficiency.', '“We will pursue customers like Apple” for Intel’s foundry business, Gelsinger said.', 'Gelsinger said on Tuesday that its 7-nanometer chips are on track to hit a milestone in the second quarter and that it plans to manufacture the majority of its products itself. Still, Intel will increase its use of third-party foundries, including TSMC, Samsung, and GlobalFoundries, he said.', 'Intel also announced full-year guidance. The company said it expects $4.55 in adjusted earnings per share on $72 billion, below Refinitiv estimates of $4.77 in adjusted earnings per share and $72.94 billion in revenue in revenue. Intel said it expects $19 billion to $20 billion in capital expenditures for the year. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected $14.59 billion.', 'CNBC’s Jordan Novet contributed to this story.']"

Now named the more consumer-friendly sounding Fifth Season, the emerging business is leveraging advanced technology, $75 million in venture capital, increased distribution, a planned new Columbus, Ohio, facility, and an expanded management team to score in the fast-growth vertical farming market. CEO Webb confidently projects Fifth Season could be a $15 million business in Pittsburgh within five years and $500 million through geographic expansion plans, and estimates sales will hit a double-digit revenue rate this year and a 600% revenue increase.   “Our smart manufacturing facility improves the yield, taste and texture of the vegetables, and does that with 95% less water, 95% less land, and uses no pesticides or chemicals,” said Webb, who is 33. Fifth Season’s automated proprietary system grows fresh produce year-round indoors in vertical trays, relying on artificial intelligence, robotics and data to control light, water and nutrients, and harvest leafy greens.', 'Currently less than 1% of fresh produce is grown through hydroponics systems versus open-field agriculture, but this segment is forecast by Mordor Intelligence to grow by nearly 11% yearly to about $600 million by 2025. “There’s tremendous runway as the price comes down and more reliable operations remove the risk,” said Brian Holland, managing director of Cowen & Co. in New York.  “It’s a race to scale with potentially multiple winners who can prove the economic model for automatic, robotic growing,” he added. “Fifth Season is more advanced, if not the most advanced, in the market in marrying technology and robotics to grow vegetables indoors at a lower cost.”', 'Fifth Season is competing in a capital intensive, highly fragmented market with more than 2,000, mostly smaller farms and a handful of larger scale players.

', 'For chip manufacturers, the preferential treatment period starts from the first profit-making year. ', 'But it’s not just the actual manufacturing side of the industry getting tax relief. Other players working in areas from chip design and software, areas where the U.S. and Europe have been traditionally very strong, also received tax incentives.', 'Beijing’s new policies also focus on funding and encourages firms to list on China’s technology-focused stock exchanges such as the Shanghai Science and Technology Innovation Board, often dubbed the STAR Market.

What’s more, management told investors that the company could have shipped even more of its products to customers during the quarter, but upside was limited by the supply.', 'It should be noted that Cirrus reached a long-term supply agreement with semiconductor manufacturer GlobalFoundries. “While details were scarce, we believe the primary purpose was as a second source supplier, a prudent move given the growing constrained environment,” Rolland said.', 'Additionally, the company offered up more details about its acquisition of Lion Semiconductor, which was announced in July. Management is calling for $60 million in additional revenue for the year, and Cirrus is expecting to have existing strong relationships with numerous Chinese original equipment manufacturers. ', '“The company also carefully highlighted new shipments into the laptop PC market, perhaps a new area of growth beyond their traditional handset stalwart,” Rolland said.', 'All of this prompted the analyst to add, “In short, we were encouraged by the strong bounce back.”', 'Offering further explanation, he said, “We were pleased by the strong top-line snap back as we continue to believe the close relationship with Apple, shared IP, and high level of execution in delivering quality product will continue to grow Cirrus content at the [original equipment manufacturer] over time. Additionally, while a ‘moonshot call’, we could also envision a scenario in which Apple makes a bid for Cirrus, turning their TX facilities into ‘Apple Austin’ and a hub for the OEM’s custom high-performance mixed-signal silicon innovations.”', 'Earning the #36 spot on TipRanks’ list, Rolland has a 76% success rate and 24.6% average return per rating.', 'Mizuho Securities analyst Siti Panigrahi says the “strong momentum” is continuing for Twilio.

We believe the WFE mix shift to foundry/logic, EUV proliferating to DRAM, and Intel returning to an annual process technology cadence disproportionately favor KLAC.”', 'Considering the WFE cycle from 2011 to 2018, Bolton noted that the most significant difference between KLAC and its peers in the process equipment space is that the former’s performance is stronger during downcycle years and weaker in upcycle years.', '“Although through the entire cycle, KLAC’s growth may be largely in-line with peers, as WFE enters the current super cycle, we believe investors are as concerned as we were about KLAC’s ability to outperform. So far, KLAC has proven us wrong,” Bolton said. Therefore, he concluded, “the company can outperform in the upcycle.”', 'On top of this, in the last few months, KLAC has taken a dip and is now trading at a discount to Lam Research and Applied Materials on a price-earnings basis, which is an “aberration rather than the norm from a historical perspective,” in Bolton’s opinion.

This phenomenon was first recognized in the 1970s when an oil shock led to an extended period of higher prices but sharply falling GDP growth.', 'Similarly, energy prices have spiked recently, contributing to inflation fears.', 'In an October report, Morgan Stanley noted that stagflation risks are drawing investor attention, and could stem from a “supply shock.”', '“Disruption of global supply chains has caused shortages in areas such as energy and semiconductors. These situations could drag into next year, which would likely keep inflationary pressures high in the short term,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.', 'Stagflation presents a problem for economic policymakers because measures to curb inflation — such as wage and price controls or contractionary monetary policy — may further increase unemployment.', 'Goldman Sachs also warned in October that stagflation could be bad for stocks.', 'Below are a few approaches analysts suggest investors can take in navigating stagflation risks.', 'Morgan Stanley said investors can adopt a barbell strategy and own cheap valuation stocks with high free cash flow and dividends. Free cash flow is a measure of profitability, representing the amount of cash a company generates after accounting for outflows to support spending.', 'Earlier this year, the investment bank said a barbell strategy can hedge against market pullbacks. This strategy involves being overweight on two distinct groups of stocks to hedge against uncertainty about the market’s next move.

The ECB could rush to the exit in its meeting next month, announcing a quick wrap up of its QE programs and signal a rate hike already in the summer.”', '“This could prove a mistake, as the invasion would likely hurt growth as well. Soaring energy prices would hit household and business purchasing power, confidence and willingness to spend and invest. Imports costs would rise more than export value, hurting the trade balance. The post-omicron recovery could well be weakened,” he added.', 'Cominetta also highlighted that the cost of credit could be driven up in southern and eastern Europe, a trend already seen in the Baltic states, while eastern European central banks will also need to contend with a devaluation of their currencies.', '“A Russian invasion would send their currencies sharply down, exactly the opposite of what central banks wanted, in a bid to control inflation,” he said.', '“Currency reserves will then have to be spent to prop up the currencies, stabilize inflation and maintain financial stability.

Also, video gaming saw a massive rebound during the pandemic, but can developers like Take-Two Interactive continue to reap revenues? As another example, sports are back, but FuboTV is now betting on sportsbook gaming to accelerate its business. Additionally, the societal shift toward cloud services has created a significant demand for cloud infrastructure and services companies like Calix, but will the firm maintain its relevance? Finally, the highly competitive semiconductor developer industry is a tight race, but it appears Advanced Micro Devices is setting itself up for some well-designed few quarters.

Not only is Cohu scaling its semi test sales, but it is also increasing its penetration of the auto space and boosting its contractor attachment rates, which the analyst believes could fuel an improvement in margins.', 'As for recurring revenues, Graham sees this as an “undervalued aspect of the stock’s valuation” because although they might grow at a slower pace than systems sales, they are “more resilient in down cycles and have higher margins than systems sales.”', 'Currently, Graham is tracking a 69% success rate and 14.9% average return per rating.', 'Even with 50% sales growth for CY21E “in some of the most desirable, duopolistic large total addressable market  ($70 billion-plus) markets in semis,” Bank of America Securities analyst Vivek Arya points out that Advanced Micro Devices has lagged its peers in the space year-to-date.

AMD is already seeing results with accelerated server share in Q1 2021.”', 'Additionally, AMD’s share of the supercomputing market has increased by more than 2x in the last six months, and 5x in the last year, which shows “AMD’s improved competitiveness in HPC, a strong leading indicator for future cloud/enterprise momentum,” in Arya’s opinion.', 'He added, “Even more notable, AMD now powers three of the top ten supercomputers, the same number as INTC for first time ever.”', 'Looking at the valuation, Arya calls it “compelling” at “just 6x CY22 EV/sales for 25%-plus sales growth from 2020- 2023E.” This reflects a significant discount to other infotech companies.', 'Arya’s 70% success rate and 28.1% average return per rating support his #83 ranking on TipRanks’ list of best-performing analysts.']"
