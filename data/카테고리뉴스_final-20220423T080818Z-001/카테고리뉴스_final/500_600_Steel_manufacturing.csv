As concerns about sustainability and the environment mount, however, a number of firms are attempting to reduce the impact of their operations with factories and offices using clever design, interesting materials and renewable sources of energy.', 'Earlier this week, designs for a new furniture factory in Norway were released, with the firms involved in its development hoping it will be sustainable, aesthetically pleasing and technologically advanced.', 'Known as The Plus, the 6,500-meter-squared building will be located in Magnor, Norway and surrounded by trees, with the site also functioning as a 300-acre park.', 'The architecture practice involved with the project’s design is the  Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) and their client is Vestre, a Norwegian furniture manufacturer established in 1947. Construction work is due to start in August and when finished, the facility will be home to a range of sustainable features. According to BIG — which has offices in Copenhagen, New York, Barcelona and London — the building’s façade will be formed of local timber, recycled reinforcement steel and low-carbon concrete, while 1,200 solar panels will be installed on its roof.

3,Billions in US solar projects have been shelved after Trump panel tariff,2018-06-07T10:18:22+0000,"['President Donald Trump’s tariff on imported solar panels has led U.S. renewable energy companies to cancel or freeze investments of more than $2.5 billion in large installation projects, along with thousands of jobs, the developers told Reuters.', 'That’s more than double the about $1 billion in new spending plans announced by firms building or expanding U.S. solar panel factories to take advantage of the tax on imports.', 'The tariff’s bifurcated impact on the solar industry underscores how protectionist trade measures almost invariably hurt one or more domestic industries for every one they shield from foreign competition. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, for instance, have hurt manufacturers of U.S. farm equipment made with steel, such as tractors and grain bins, along with the farmers buying them at higher prices.', 'White House officials did not respond to a request for comment.', 'Trump announced the tariff in January over protests from most of the solar industry that the move would chill one of America’s fastest-growing sectors.', 'Solar developers completed utility-scale installations costing a total of $6.8 billion last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Those investments were driven by U.S. tax incentives and the falling costs of imported panels, mostly from China, which together made solar power competitive with natural gas and coal.', 'The U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people — about three times more than the coal industry — with about 40 percent of those people in installation and 20 percent in manufacturing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.', '“Solar was really on the cusp of being able to completely take off,” said Zoe Hanes, chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina solar developer Pine Gate Renewables.', 'GTM Research, a clean energy research firm, recently lowered its 2019 and 2020 utility-scale solar installation forecasts in the United States by 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively, citing the levies.', 'Officials at Suniva — a Chinese-owned, U.S.-based solar panel manufacturer whose bankruptcy prompted the Trump administration to consider a tariff — did not respond to requests for comment.', 'Companies with domestic panel factories are divided on the policy. Solar giant SunPower Corp. opposes the tariff that will help its U.S. panel factories because it will also hurt its domestic installation and development business, along with its overseas manufacturing operations.', '“There could be substantially more employment without a tariff,” said Chief Executive Tom Werner.', 'The 30 percent tariff is scheduled to last four years, decreasing by 5 percent per year during that time. Solar developers say the levy will initially raise the cost of major installations by 10 percent.', 'Leading utility-scale developer Cypress Creek Renewables said it had been forced to cancel or freeze $1.5 billion in projects — mostly in the Carolinas, Texas, and Colorado — because the tariff raised costs beyond the level where it could compete, spokesman Jeff McKay said.', 'That amounted to about 150 projects at various stages of development that would have employed three thousand or more workers during installation, he said. The projects accounted for a fifth of the company’s overall pipeline.', 'Developer Southern Current has made similar decisions on about $1 billion of projects, mainly in South Carolina, said Bret Sowers, the company’s vice president of development and strategy.', '“Either you make the decision to default or you bite the bullet and you make less money,” Sowers said.', 'Neither Cypress Creek nor Southern Current would disclose exactly which projects they intend to cancel. They said those details could help their competitors and make it harder to pursue those projects if they become financially viable later.', 'Both are among a group of solar developers that have asked trade officials to exclude panels used in their utility-scale projects from the tariffs. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it is still evaluating the requests.', 'Other companies are having similar problems.', 'Scott Canada, senior vice president of renewable energy at solar project builder McCarthy Building Companies, said his company had planned to employ about 1,200 people on solar projects this year but slashed that number by half because of the tariff.', 'Pine Gate, meanwhile, will complete about half of the 400 megawatts of solar installations it had planned this year and has ditched plans to hire 30 permanent employees, Hanes said.', 'The company also withdrew an 80-megawatt project that would have cost up to $150 million from consideration in a bidding process held by Southern Co. utility Georgia Power. It pulled the proposal late last year when it learned the Trump administration was contemplating the tariff.', '“It was just not feasible,” Hanes said.', 'For some developers, the tariff has meant abandoning nascent markets in the American heartland that last year posted the strongest growth in installations. That growth was concentrated in states where voters supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election.', 'South Bend, Indiana-based developer Inovateus Solar, for example, had decided three years ago to focus on emerging Midwest solar markets such as Indiana and Michigan. But the tariff sparked a shift to Massachusetts, where state renewable energy incentives make it more profitable, chairman T.J. Kanczuzewski said.', 'Other developers are forging ahead, keen to take advantage of the remaining years of a 30-percent federal tax credit for solar installation that is scheduled to start phasing out in 2020.', 'Some firms saw the tariff coming and stockpiled panels before Trump’s announcement. 174 Power Global, the development arm of Korea’s Hanwha warehoused 190 megawatts of solar panels at the end of last year for a Texas project that broke ground in January.', 'The company is paying more for panels for two Nevada projects that start operating this year and next, but is moving forward on construction, according to Larry Greene, who heads the firm’s development in the U.S. West.', 'Intersect Power, a developer that cut a deal last year with Austin Energy to provide low-cost power to the Texas capital city, is also pushing ahead, said CEO Sheldon Kimber. But the tariff is forcing delays in buying solar panels.', 'The 150-megawatt project is due to start producing power in 2020. Waiting until the last minute to purchase modules will allow the company to take advantage of the tariff’s 5-percent annual reductions, he said.', 'Trump’s tariff has boosted the domestic manufacturing sector as intended, which over time could significantly raise U.S. panel production and reduce prices.', 'Panel manufacturers First Solar and JinkoSolar, for example, have announced plans to spend $800 million on projects to increase panel construction in the United States since the tariff, creating about 700 new jobs in Ohio and Florida. Just last week, Korea’s Hanwha Q CELLS joined them, saying it will open a solar module factory in Georgia next year, though it did not detail job creation.', 'SunPower Corp., meanwhile, purchased U.S. manufacturer SolarWorld’s Oregon factory after the tariff was announced, saving that facility’s 280 jobs. The company said it plans to hire more people at the plant to expand operations, without specifying how many.', 'But SunPower has also said it must cut up to 250 jobs in other parts of its organization because of the tariffs.', 'Jobs in panel manufacturing are also limited due to increasing automation, industry experts said.', 'Heliene — a Canadian company in the process of opening a U.S. facility capable of producing 150 megawatts worth of panels per year — said it will employ between 130 and 140 workers in Minnesota.', '“The factories are highly automated,” said Martin Pochtaruk, president of Heliene. “You don’t employ too many humans. There are a lot of robots.”']"

Meanwhile, countries outside of North America — like China — are capitalizing on Nafta’s weak rules and benefiting from the trade agreement, the report said.', 'The administration’s report is expected to dominate Nafta discussions over so-called “rules of origin.” Those rules govern how much of a good must be produced in North America to qualify for Nafta’s zero tariffs on many products.', 'More from New York Times: Facebook’s Frankenstein momentMegyn Kelly is ready for her morning closeupIn Germany, blue-collar jobs provide bulwark to populism', 'The United States is expected to push for raising those limits. Negotiators also appear poised to argue for a new requirement on how much of those goods need to be made in the United States.', 'Current thresholds vary for different products, but are aimed at ensuring that North American workers receive most of Nafta’s benefits.', 'The rules for automobiles, for example, require 62.5 percent of the value of a car must be manufactured in Canada, Mexico or the United States for the automobile to move between the countries, duty-free. That means a car could source up to 37.5 percent of its value from a country like China and still be eligible for preferential treatment under Nafta.', 'These requirements have become one of the biggest areas of conflict in the Nafta debate, particularly for American negotiators who are seeking to fulfill one of President Trump’s biggest campaign promises: Remaking trade agreements to revive American manufacturing.', 'Since 1994, Nafta has knit the North American economy together by lowering the barriers that companies face when they ship products across borders. While most studies suggest the deal has had a modest overall effect on the United States economy, it has encouraged companies to reorganize their supply chains by moving lower-cost operations to Mexico. And it has become a huge source of controversy, with Mr. Trump describing it as the “worst trade deal ever made.”', 'The president and his advisers argue that the pact has created a “back door” for foreign products. They say that the deal currently allows raw materials or components to be shipped into North America from elsewhere and incorporated into manufactured goods, like cars or electronics, that can then be shipped among Canada, Mexico and the United States without paying import duties.', 'In its report, the Commerce Department said that the share of American-produced content in manufactured goods imported by the United States from Mexico fell from 26 percent in 1995, shortly after Nafta was signed into law, to 16 percent in 2011. The share of United States content in imports from Canada, meanwhile, fell from 21 percent in 1995 to 15 percent in 2011. Imports from Asia, and especially China, helped make up the difference.', 'The same trend was visible in motor vehicles and, to a lesser extent, basic metals like steel and aluminum, the report said.', 'The report does not mention any economic factors outside of the United States. In the same time period, Chinese manufacturing and trade surged, as the country modernized and joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.', '“We cannot forget that the point of a free-trade agreement is to advantage those within the agreement — not to help outsiders,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross wrote in an accompanying op-ed that was  published on Thursday by The Washington Post. “Instead, Nafta has provided entry into a bigger market for outside countries, and the United States is paying the price.”', 'On Saturday, negotiators from the three Nafta countries will gather in Ottawa, the Canadian capital, to begin five days of talks. Rules of origin are expected to be discussed, and potentially also labor rights, government purchasing guidelines and methods of resolving trade disputes.', 'The Trump administration may have a tough time convincing Canadian and Mexican negotiators, who have said they are not in favor of country-specific rules of origin. And it could also face opposition within the United States.', 'Some groups, like  the United Steelworkers Union, say the administration is right to fight for higher levels of American-made goods. Big businesses, however, mostly disagree. Groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers argue that Nafta already has some of the highest rules of origin requirements of any trade deal.', 'Among their concerns is that raising thresholds to higher levels could ultimately push manufacturing out of the United States altogether. As the thresholds for how much content must be made in America rise, it becomes more expensive and complicated for companies to source their parts within North America.', 'At some point, a company may decide it is more cost-effective to produce cars in China and simply pay a penalty to export the entire vehicle to the United States. For imported cars, the tariff is relatively low, at 2.5 percent – suggesting the administration may not have that much space to raise rules of origin before businesses just start paying the tariff instead.']"
5,How Trump’s tariffs may hit your wallet,2018-03-17T19:46:27+0000,"['President Donald Trump’s tariffs may come at a cost to foreign aluminum and steel producers, but higher costs will likely hit consumers in the wallet, too.', '“A tariff is essentially a tax, for all intents and purposes,” Stifel Financial’s chief economist Lindsey Piegza told CNBC recently. Some economists expect producers will find a way to pass the extra costs along to consumers, primarily in the form of higher product prices.', 'The tariffs, expected to start late next week, will bring a 25 percent increase in steel and 10 percent on aluminum imports.', '“We really do expect price increases on aluminum and steel specifically, but we’re also looking for cost increases in all products that heavily rely on (them) as a productive input, ” Piegza said to CNBC’s “On The Money” in an interview.', 'When Trump’s policy decision was announced earlier in March, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told CNBC the tariffs were “no big deal” and would have a “trivial” impact on prices. To make his point, the billionaire brandished a can of soup on air, saying the tariffs would only have a marginal impact on consumers.', 'Piegza, however, took the opposite view. ', '“From a consumer standpoint, pop can makers, soup can makers, beer manufacturers, we do expect an increase in price about two to six cents per unit,” the economist told CNBC.', 'While that probably won’t be high enough to deter the purchase of a six pack of beer or soda, Piegza added: “If this is passed on directly to the consumer, it can easily sway them from making certain purchases on a daily or monthly basis. When you talk about this on an annual pace, that’s hundreds of millions of dollars.”', 'The protection of U.S. jobs was a primary goal when Trump announced his intention to implement these tariffs, but Piegza sees the potential for loss as offsetting the possible gain.', '“You are talking about a couple hundred thousand jobs that certainly will see increased protection,” Piezga said, pointing to domestic steel and aluminum workers. “On the other hand, you’re talking about increasing prices and potentially squeezing out workers from other sectors , there you’re talking about millions of workers. ”', 'Beyond protecting jobs and trying to negotiate better deals with trading partners, the president has another stated goal in implementing aluminum and steel tariffs.', '“There is a national security component here,” Piegza told CNBC.', '“We do want to make sure we do have a minimal manufacturing base here in the U.S., to protect domestic interests, particularly during a wartime economy,” she said. “So it is important we have certain protections in place.”', 'On the Money airs on CNBC Saturday at 5:30 am ET, or check listings for air times in local markets.

A better-than-expected nonfarm payrolls report coupled with a convincing uptick in manufacturing and construction activity showed that the second half approaches with a tail wind blowing.', '“The fundamentals all look very solid right now,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC. “You’ve got job growth and wage gains that are supporting consumer spending, and tax cuts as well. There’s a little bit of a drag from higher energy prices, but the positives far outweigh that. Business incentives are in good shape.”', 'The day started off with the payrolls report showing a gain of 223,000 in May, well above market expectations of 188,000, and the unemployment rate hitting an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. ', 'Then, the ISM manufacturing index registered a 58.7 reading — representing the percentage of businesses that report expanding conditions — that also topped Wall Street estimates. Finally, the construction spending report showed a monthly gain of 1.8 percent, a full point higher than expectations.', 'Put together, the data helped fuel expectations that first-quarter growth of 2.2 percent will be the low-water point of 2018.', '“May’s rebound in jobs together with yesterday’s report of solid income growth and the rise in consumer confidence points to the economy functioning very well,” the National Retail Federation’s chief economist, Jack Kleinhenz, said in a statement. “Solid fundamentals in the job market are encouraging for retail spending, as employment gains generate additional income for consumers and consequently increase spending.”', 'The most recent slate of widely followed barometers could see economists ratchet up growth expectations.', 'Already, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracker sees the second quarter rising by 4.8 percent. While the measure also was strongly optimistic on the first quarter as well, at one point estimating 5.4 percent growth, other gauges are positive as well. CNBC’s Rapid Update, for instance, puts the April-to-June period at 3.6 percent.', 'Andrew Hunter, U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said the ISM number alone is consistent with GDP growth of better than 4 percent, though he thinks the second quarter will be in the 3 percent to 3.5 percent range.', '“With global growth set to hold up fairly well in the near term, this suggests that manufacturing activity should continue to expand at a solid pace,” Hunter said in a note. “That said, if the Trump administration continues to pursue protectionist policies and provoke retaliation from other countries, the export-focused manufacturing sector would be most exposed.”', 'Indeed, there are a spate of headwinds still out there, and trade continues to top the list.', 'The White House’s decision this week to forge ahead with steel and aluminum tariffs stoked fears that the administration could be its own worst enemy on the road to 3 percent-plus growth. While the tariffs themselves are expected to have minimal economic impact on their own, fears remain that they could spark retaliatory measures and, ultimately, an all-out trade war.', 'Exports make up just 12.4 percent of the U.S. economy, but S&P 500 companies generate about 43 percent of their sales internationally. That’s why markets tend to recoil every time the administration saber rattles about tariffs.', 'Still, manufacturers remain largely upbeat.', 'Respondents to the ISM survey released Friday relayed mostly positive sentiments. One typical statement, from an unidentified transportation equipment firm, said, “We are currently overselling our forecast and don’t see an end to the upswing in business,” while noting that “we are very concerned” about the tariff situation and “are focusing on alternatives to Chinese sourcing.”', 'Others noted price pressures, while an index that tracks order backlogs hit its highest level since April 2004. The pricing index also registered its highest since April 2011, as firms noted that inflationary pressures are building heading into the second half.', 'That’s consistent with news out of the trucking industry, which is reporting a shortage of drivers amid huge demand for delivery vehicles.', 'While inflation could prompt more aggressive action in the form of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, PNC’s Faucher sees an economy resilient enough to withstand that and other headwinds.', '“The tight labor market is going to lead businesses to invest in capital that makes their workers more productive. Then you’ve got stronger government spending with the increase in discretionary spending caps,” he said. “I think we’ll see growth better than 3 percent in the final three quarters of the year.”']"

If successful, the overall project could potentially have quite far-reaching implications.', 'In a statement, GE Renewable explained that wind turbine towers had “traditionally” been built in precast concrete or steel and “typically been limited to a height of under 100 meters.”', 'This, the company explained, was because the width of a turbine tower’s base could not “exceed the 4.5 diameter that can be transported by road, without excessive additional costs.”', 'The on-site printing of bases would, in theory, allow for bigger bases and therefore taller turbines. And the taller a turbine, the more energy it can produce, which could in turn reduce costs. “Concrete printing has advanced significantly over the last five years and we believe (it) … is getting closer to have real application in the industrial world,” Matteo Bellucci, GE Renewable Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Technology leader, said in a statement. “We are committed to taking full advantage of this technology both from the design flexibility it allows, as well as for the logistic simplification it enables on such massive components,” Bellucci added. ', 'The collaboration announced Wednesday comes in the same week that Swedish firm Modvion said it had received 69 million Swedish krona (around $7.36 million) in funding from the European Union’s EIC Accelerator program.Modvion specializes in the development of wooden wind turbine towers. In April, it installed a 30-meter tower on an island near Gothenburg.

The rocket is built of stainless steel, representing the early versions of the rocket that Musk unveiled in 2019.', 'The company is developing Starship with the goal of launching cargo and people on missions to the moon and Mars.', 'The SN11 flight will be similar to the ones SpaceX has conducted in the past four months, with the test flights of prototypes SN8, SN9, and SN10. While each of the prior rockets launched successfully and completed multiple development objectives, all three prototypes were explosively destroyed – SN8 and SN9 on impact during landing attempts, and SN10 a few minutes after landing.', 'The FAA opened an investigation after the SN10 explosion, saying in a statement to CNBC “that issues related to the FAA mishap had no effect on public safety.” The FAA approved modifications to SpaceX’s launch license for SN11, with the company then authorized to conduct its next flight test.', 'Like its predecessors’ flights, the goal of the SN11 launch is not necessarily to reach the maximum altitude, but rather to test several key parts of the Starship system. The Starship prototype stands at about 150 feet tall, or about the size of a 15-story building, and is powered by three Raptor rocket engines. SpaceX will fire all three engines for liftoff and then shut them down one at a time in sequence as it nears the top of the flight’s intended altitude.', 'SN11 will aim to transfer propellant from its main tanks to the header tanks, and then flip itself for the “belly flop” reentry maneuver so it can control its descent through the air with the rocket’s four flaps. Then, in the final moments of descent, SpaceX will flip return the rocket to a vertical orientation and fire the Raptor engines to slow itself down for a landing attempt.', 'Notably, SN11 launching on Friday would mark 24 days since SN10 flew, cutting nearly a week off the previous turnaround time as SpaceX ramps up manufacturing in Texas.', 'Starship is one of two “Manhattan Projects” that SpaceX is simultaneously developing, with the other being its Starlink satellite internet program. Musk has previously estimated that it will cost about $5 billion to fully develop Starship, although SpaceX has not disclosed how much it has spent on the program to date.', 'The company last month brought in $850 million in its latest capital fundraise at a $74 billion valuation.', 'Musk remains “highly confident” that Starship “will be safe enough for human transport by 2023″ – an ambitious goal given the company began the rocket’s development and testing in earnest in early 2019.', '']"

Inside, Mexican workers churn out millions of medical devices each day, from intravenous bags to artificial respirators, for the global market.', 'Nearly everyone in America who has a pacemaker — in fact, people all over the world — walks around with parts from here.', 'More from New York Times: SpaceX Launches a Satellite With a Partly Used Rocket Senate Narrowly Passes Rollback of Obama-Era ‘Auto-I.R.A.’ Rule State I.R.A. Plans Are Ready, if Congress Doesn’t Interfere', 'When President Trump threatens to redo trade deals and slap steep taxes on imports in an effort to add more manufacturing jobs, he focuses largely on car companies and air-conditioner makers. But the medical devices business makes a particularly revelatory case study of the difficulties of untangling global trade.', 'America imports about 30 percent of its medical devices and supplies. The trouble is, these jobs are among the most difficult to relocate to the United States. To ensure the safety of products that often end up inside the human body, medical devices are strictly regulated and require lengthy approvals from the Food and Drug Administration and other inspectors.', 'If the companies do keep major operations outside the country, new taxes on imports would most likely increase the cost of their products — a change that could jolt not only the devices industry in coming years, but also health care nationwide.', 'Here in Tijuana the factories are bound to stay put for years, at least. During that time, health executives say, a border tax could fracture the industry’s sophisticated global supply chain and force American hospitals to pay more for vital necessities — or worse.', '“The real danger is the supplies won’t be available at all,” said Dr. John Jay Shannon, chief executive of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System in Chicago.', 'American hospitals rely on heaps of bandages and surgical gloves from China, suturing needles and artificial joints from Ireland, and defibrillators and catheters from Mexico. In all, the annual imports of medical devices more than tripled from 2001 to 2016, when it reached $43.9 billion, according to BMI Research, a unit of the Fitch Group.', 'Mexico is the leading supplier, ahead of Ireland, Germany and China. And few places illustrate this changing landscape, or help explain the complexity of the industry, as well as Tijuana, 20 miles south of San Diego.', 'The city houses the highest concentration of Mexico’s medical device firms, 70 percent of which are American-owned, according to the local development group. Companies including Medtronic, CareFusion, DJO Global and Hill-Rom-Welch Allyn — some that have their headquarters just up the road in San Diego — have invested heavily in Tijuana, constructing long, low-slung factories tucked into the hilly terrain. Giant banners hanging from manufacturing plants plead for workers to join them.', 'The high-tech operations emerged after Nafta helped transform Mexican border factories, known as maquiladoras, into industrial powerhouses. Now, instead of being garment sweatshops, many maquiladoras in Tijuana employ a new generation of Mexican engineers and skilled technicians to make orthopedic devices, surgical equipment and catheters.', 'The factories have helped remake the city’s reputation from a ribald party town to a locus of sophisticated industrial manufacturing. Roadside shanties made of corrugated metal and plastic abut new apartment complexes painted fuchsia and lime green; late-model S.U.V.s bounce along potholed roads. Workers pass through imposing security gates to begin shifts operating advanced machinery or delicately sewing pig tissue onto stents for heart valves, and trucks zip in a steady line across the border in preclearance, fast-track lanes into California.', 'But the possibility of new protectionist trade policies is already looming over this buzz of activity. The question for many of the people here is whether it will upend the economic incentives that led American companies to invest in the city in the first place.', 'Mr. Trump has argued that a border tax is needed to keep well-paying jobs in the United States and dissuade companies from relying on Mexican workers who earn a small fraction of American wages. Technicians at medical device factories in Tijuana earn about $14 an hour, compared with about $25 an hour for technicians at factories in the United States.', 'Critics of Mexico’s maquiladoras system contend that wages are kept unfairly low and that workers have been kept from organizing. For companies, though, the savings are clear — as much as 45 percent for labor-intensive products — and have helped fuel the wave of development here.', 'Now, even the city’s unflappable longtime entrepreneurs are unsettled by the shift in trade talk.', 'American companies draft plans to build new plants — or expand existing ones — years in advance, said Miguel Felix Diaz, vice president of the Baja California Medical Device Cluster, an organization that represents 63 medical device manufacturing plants that employ 60,000 Mexican workers.', '“For that reason now,” he said, “you don’t know if you start some operation tomorrow how it’s going to be affected.”', 'If the United States does approve a border tax, Mr. Felix Diaz added, “the final customer is going to pay.”', 'The final tally of just how much American customers — hospitals, clinics, nursing homes and doctors’ offices — would pay is unclear. Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers have yet to release a detailed plan on trade tariffs or corporate tax reform.', 'In addition, the final price on many medical devices is negotiated by group-purchasing organizations, which harness the purchasing power of hospitals and others and would try to mitigate any price increases.', 'Mike Alkire, chief operating officer at Premier, which negotiates for some 3,750 American hospitals, said that while prices would initially spike if the Trump administration hit countries like Mexico or China with tariffs, “we’ve got enough diversity in the way we source products, we think we can manage the costs.”', '“Over the long term,” Mr. Alkire added, “we do think the market will stabilize and the most efficient place to produce products will occur.”', 'But chief executives at some of the United States’ largest hospitals are nervously watching the gathering legislative, economic and geopolitical storm. The executives say this concern on trade is based on simple math.', 'In Chicago, Cook County’s public clinics and hospitals spend $62 million a year on medical supplies, including 120,432 boxes of gloves, 44,434 boxes of syringes and 403,460 bags of fluids. Safety-net hospitals that care for poor patients would be unable to pass along price increases because the programs that insure those patients, Medicaid and Medicare, pay fixed rates for care.', '“It’s a bunch of dominoes,” said Doug Elwell, deputy chief executive for finance and strategy at the county hospital system. Private or for-profit hospitals, because they serve largely privately insured patients, “can pass along 10 percent in the bill,” he said. “But we can’t.”', 'A border tax, experts say, would ricochet back and forth across the United States-Mexico border — and around the world — in unintended ways.', 'Mexico’s medical device industry buys much of its raw materials and capital machinery from American suppliers. The American-owned Integer plant in Tijuana, for example, buys 90 percent of its raw materials, essentially duty-free, from the United States: stainless steel to be stamped into cups used for hip replacements and plastic to be molded into catheters. Then half of the factory’s output is shipped back to the United States and much of the rest to American-owned companies in Puerto Rico, Switzerland and Singapore.', 'If Mexico imposes tariffs on raw materials from American suppliers, a likely response to any border tax imposed by the United States, production costs would spike for companies in Mexico or those companies would shift to suppliers in other countries eager to cut low-tariff deals like China. Imports from China contain around 4 percent of content from the United States, while imports from Mexico contain about 40 percent, and even more in products like medical devices.', '“The damage wouldn’t just to be to the Mexico operation, it would be to U.S. suppliers,” said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.', 'Companies would also face a regulatory thicket should they move or change suppliers.', 'The Food and Drug Administration inspects and certifies hundreds of medical device manufacturers in China, Europe, Mexico and elsewhere, and even minor manufacturing changes must be certified, a process that can take many months.', '“Medical devices is a very stringent process,” said Jorge Hernandez, director of operations at Integer in Tijuana, an American-owned company that makes components for pacemakers and defibrillators, among other devices.', 'The Integer plant in Tijuana that Mr. Hernandez oversees looks like a vast scientific laboratory. Behind glass windows, in so-called clean rooms, employees in blue hair caps and bootees tend to machines that process gold and platinum into tiny components for pacemakers. In one room, workers sit shoulder to shoulder, peering into microscopes as they expertly remove tiny debris from freshly made parts. Even the smallest change in these manufacturing protocols would require a new inspection.', 'Integer’s legacy company, Greatbatch Medical, opened the plant in 2005. Over the years, the company consolidated some of its manufacturing from Carson City, Nev., and Columbia, Md., to Tijuana, drawn by the lower wages and the pool of skilled technicians graduating from Mexican universities.', 'The company, like many others here, is seamlessly integrated: Employees in Tijuana videoconference with research and development teams in the United States to fine-tune product designs. The border seems like a quaint historical footnote.', '“People need to understand this relationship we have goes both ways,” said David Mayagoitia, president of the board of the Tijuana Economic Development Corporation.', 'Sitting inside an office in a modern glass and concrete building in downtown Tijuana, Mr. Felix Diaz said Mexicans and Americans had built strong relationships.', '“We are dealing daily, we are eating together, we drink a couple of tequilas,” he said. “We don’t want to start any commercial war.”']"

For the first eleven months, profits at industrial firms rose 11.8 percent from the same period a year earlier to 6.1 trillion yuan, slowing from a 13.6 percent increase in January-October.', 'The decline in profits largely reflected slowing growth in sales and producer prices as well as rising costs, He Ping of the statistics bureau said in a statement accompanying the data.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ index (PMI) fell to 51.2 in March, missing economist forecasts’ of 51.6 and down from February’s 51.7.  While the index was still well above the 50.0 mark which separates expansion from contraction on a monthly basis, the rates of growth in output, total new orders, input and output prices all slipped in March from the previous month.  Growth in export orders slowed sharply, falling to a three-month low of 51.9 from 53.8 in February.  The findings contrast with those of China’s official factory survey on Friday, which showed activity grew the fastest in nearly five years in March. It also showed orders improved from home and abroad.  But the Caixin/Markit survey tends to focus more on small and mid-sized manufacturers, which may be benefitting less from a months-long construction boom than big industrials such as steel mills. A sub-index of the official survey had showed small companies were still struggling, though conditions were slowly improving.  The private survey is also believed to be more reflective of export-oriented firms. Cloudy export outlook', 'While China and other North Asian exporters have seen a strong rebound in shipments in recent months both in value and volume terms, the outlook is being clouded by fears of growing U.S. trade protectionism under President Donald Trump.  The Trump administration on Friday slammed China again on a range of trade issues from its chronic industrial overcapacity to forced technology transfers and long-standing bans on U.S. beef and electronic payment services.  China’s manufacturing sector has been enjoying its best profits in years as a booming housing market and government infrastructure spending boosted construction.  But economists worry that fresh curbs on the heated property market and tighter credit conditions, coupled wit uncertainties about global trade, may intensify pressure on the world’s second-economy later in the year.  “Overall, the Chinese manufacturing economy continued to improve, but signs of a weakening have started to emerge ahead of the second quarter. Downward pressure may further increase,” said Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group.  The survey showed manufacturers continued to shed staff, and at a slightly quicker pace than the previous month, but the employment outlook remained relatively positive as it was the second-weakest seen in just over two years.  On the brighter side, the pace of inventory reduction quickened in March with stocks of purchases and stocks of finished goods both falling into contractionary territory.', 'An industry survey on Friday showed that China’s steel inventory by March 31 was almost 30 percent higher than the same time last year, igniting worries that steelmakers would soon face large destocking pressures.', 'Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.']"

China is Canada’s No. 2 trading  partner, behind only the U.S., taking $20.6 billion on Canadian  goods and services last year, up 75 percent since 2009, according  to Statistics Canada. But since Canada mostly ships oil to China,  that surge is at risk — and with it some part of last year’s  $350 billion in U.S. exports to Canada.', '  But it’s not clear if the fallout on trade will be devastating. A  lot of the drop in the dollar value of trade to Brazil, for  example, is related to the surge in the value of the dollar,  which makes payment in reals less valuable, Cochrane said.', ' —By Tim Mullaney, special to CNBC.com']"

Tech companies from both countries have been pitted against one another, as an enormous amount of American technology is produced in China due to the cheap costs, Ives said, and competition over who will cash in on the technology of tomorrow — in particular, artificial intelligence — is extremely fierce. Security concerns are virtually promised to be an issue for many years to come.', 'Tom Kellermann, chief cybersecurity officer of the security firm Carbon Black and the former commissioner of President Barack Obama’s cybersecurity council, told NBC News on Thursday that the Bloomberg article is a small example of China’s larger efforts to spy on and disrupt U.S. businesses. ', 'Kellermann said his firm has tracked a threefold increase in destructive cyberattacks coming from China, pushing it past Russia over the summer to be the most active adversary targeting U.S. companies.', 'Apple, the most profitable company in the world and the first to reach a $1 trillion market cap, like many technology companies has built its business model around a complex global supply chain that includes Chinese manufacturers.', '“Look, this is a game of high-stakes poker between the U.S. and China, and this is just another card that’s been dealt in this game,” Ives said. ”[Wall] Street believes the story has credibility, and it has fanned the flames of worry around China hacking the U.S. tech giants, which have a clear bulls-eye on their back, given this threat environment.”', 'China and the United States have competed for years economically, and China is expected to pass the United States in GDP in the coming years to become the world’s largest economy. An escalating trade war is being fought between the two countries as Trump wants to eliminate America’s trade deficit. Further fueling the feud is a deep divide between how China and the United States think about the relationships between government, national security and economic security, said Derek Scissors, resident scholar and China expert at the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute.', 'Scissors said he couldn’t vouch for the specific details in the Bloomberg report, but it is consistent with the general concerns he has been hearing about for some time. “This is a tough situation, because big corporations are never going to admit it,” he said, adding, “It would be more surprising if the Chinese didn’t try to do something like this than if they did.”', 'The American Enterprise Institute China expert said he spoke with administration officials in November 2016 during discussions about the start of an investigation of China’s policies for tech transfer and intellectual property, called a Section 301 investigation, and attendees specifically brought up the threat of China using the supply chain to steal trade secrets from American tech companies or importers. Chinese trade-secret theft is not new, he said, but the methods outlined in the Bloomberg piece are, though it makes sense, as Chinese methods are growing more complex over time.', '“The fundamental clash here between the U.S. and China comes from the fact that China is not a market economy,” Scissors said.', 'The United States draws a sharp distinction between government and business interests, and its people are often deeply skeptical of Uncle Sam interfering with corporations. Historically, Scissors said, the United States has looked at national and economic security as separate domains, and there’s no incentive or even mechanism by which the government would take action to help American businesses or hurt foreign competitors.', '“We’ve always thought if you’re spying on their government or their military, that’s normal, but spying on their companies — oh, that’s cheating,” Scissors said.', 'For China, on the other hand, anything goes.', '“Their government works hand in hand with their companies all the time,” he said. “That’s absolutely standard practice in China, and it would be bizarre if they didn’t do that.”', 'Specific examples of China spying on U.S. companies rarely become public knowledge, because corporations are worried if they acknowledge them, it will hurt their stock prices, Scissors said, adding that even so, this kind of thing happens regularly.', 'Shares of Super Micro, which has been trading as an over-the-counter stock since it was delisted in late August for failing to file financial reports, were down by close to 50 percent on Thursday. Apple and Amazon were both down sharply on Thursday, though their losses came amid a broad U.S. tech sector sell-off of around 2 percent, and higher Treasury yields were cited as a reason for a risk-off day in the stock market. J.P. Morgan released a report predicting a full-on trade war between the U.S. and China was its base-case scenario for 2019, though it predicted dire consequences for China’s stock market.', 'Tech stocks continued to lead stock losses on Friday in another down day for the markets as rates ticked up again. Famed hedge fund manager David Einhorn said on Friday that he’d sold all of his Apple stock based on fears China would retaliate more against U.S. as a result of the trade war.', 'Because of the ties between Chinese government and the country’s businesses, the world’s most populous country sees no difference between what’s good for Chinese businesses and what’s in the interest of Chinese national security, Scissors said. China sets out to damage foreign corporations not because they’re American, but just because they’re competing against Chinese companies. Using the military or intelligence services to spy on private companies is totally acceptable in their view. Furthermore, many Chinese people are deeply suspicious of the United States and think imported American products already spy on them, he said, so many see it as just desserts.', 'America’s longstanding norms of separation seem to be thawing, as the Trump administration is inching toward China’s approach by slapping tariffs on foreign steel and cars saying it is in America’s national security interest, though Scissors said the use of national security in the tariff context was questionable. Either way, the U.S. is still nowhere close to China’s total singularity of the two domains, he added.', 'Within the past two years, the Trump administration also has been preceding on several fronts specifically to protect against Chinese technology threats, with multiple investigations about Chinese intellectual property abuses through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., known as CFIUS, and at the highest levels of U.S. government, warnings have been issued to American consumers about buying smartphones from two of China’s largest cell phone makers, ZTE and Huawei.', 'The threat that ZTE, viewed by some skeptics as an arm of the Chinese government, could build key future telecom infrastructure in the U.S. has been a concern for years. ZTE was on the verge of bankruptcy earlier this year based on U.S. policy moves to bar it from the market, until Trump personally stepped in to alleviate some pressure. The Trump administration blocked a merger between Broadcom and Qualcomm, citing national security and the companies’ role in the rollout of key 5G telecom technology.', '“So yes. We have taken a step in China’s direction, and people complain about that both here and around the world, but there’s a giant gap remaining,” Scissors said. “The CIA and military are absolutely not going to take action to spy on Chinese companies for the sake of American companies. But the Chinese absolutely are.”', 'Experts expect responses to come from two levels: the government in the short run and businesses in the long run.', 'For the government, “This is a ready-made excuse on a platter to say, ‘We need to do X’ because look at the terrible things the Chinese are doing,” Scissors said. “If the president gets angry, we could have more tariffs tomorrow, but I don’t think we’ll see that before the midterms.”', '“The thing is, you’re running out of space to hurt the Chinese economically without hurting the U.S., too. You can hurt the Chinese more, but the thing is people don’t vote on that. They don’t say, ‘Well, he hurt me economically but he hurt the Chinese more,’” Scissors said.', 'On Thursday night Vice President Mike Pence delivered a highly critical speech about China and its efforts to undermine Trump, which immediately led to recriminations from Chinese officials.', 'There are two non-tariff steps that Scissor thinks are likely instead. The first addresses the problem externally by imposing export controls on American businesses that work in China, which is a “very obvious response to this event,” while the second works domestically.', '“There will be people who want to throw a lot of Chinese workers and students out of the country. I’m not saying that’s going to happen, I’m definitely not saying it’s a good thing, but there’s people in the administration that want to do that, and I think this just made it more likely.”', 'Besides government action, Ives said, tech companies are also likely to take action to protect themselves.', 'The cost of manufacturing in China is so much less than in the United States that companies are forced to deal with the risk of espionage, Ives said, but as the cyber risk grows, it may change the calculus.', '“The whole food chain is built on that premise, and that’s what makes it so much more complex than moving a facility from Beijing to Middle America,” Ives said. “In the near term that’s almost an impossibility that it would shift, but over the medium term you’ll actually see more manufacturing in the U.S. as a result of a concerted effort,” Ives said.', 'As the cyberespionage fight heats up and Trump’s trade war looks likely to increase, there seems to be no doubt that the world’s two largest economies have more conflict to come.', '“If you look at U.S. and China tech and then throw 5G in it — look, it’s going to be like an MMA battle in the coming years,” Ives said.', '— By Edward McKinley, special to CNBC.com']"

She not only helped Burnett find manufacturers,  but also helped build a direct-to-consumer business, bringing  Brooklyn Bakery to shopping sites and eventually building a  consumer site of its own.', '  Together, Burnett and Menendez saw the power that local production  brought to small business owners.', '  “We’d get the shipment back within a few days, and it was amazing.  It was a very low-risk, very profitable type of  business,” Menendez said.', '  Burnett said that managing the size of orders was the key to their  success. “When I was producing domestically, I wasn’t producing a  thousand of each product. I was producing a dozen of each  product. That means that I’m able to test the market. See what  works and press the pedal to the metal, when I see that something  is moving.”', '  As they met with manufacturers and other entrepreneurs,  especially the start-ups selling their wares on websites like  Etsy and Shopify, Menendez and  Burnett began to realize that the search for  manufacturing help was a constant issue. So they decided to do  something about it. ', '  Maker’s Row went live in November of 2012. Within months, they learned it wasn’t just small businesses that needed help  finding U.S. manufacturers. The problem was much bigger than  that.', '  “Big brands are having this problem, too. We see that Wal-Mart is signing up. We see that  Burberry is signing up. These are the kings of industry that  we’re looking at here,” Burnett said. Big brands using Maker’s  Row was a big surprise “because if anyone was to have  this information, we thought that it would be the big brands.”', '  The timing is certainly good for Maker’s Row. ', '  There’s a lot of confidence among U.S. manufacturers these days.  A recent survey by the Boston Consulting Group revealed that 16  percent of the 252 U.S. manufacturers who responded are  reshoring jobs from China, a 20 percent jump from a year ago,  and more than double the number from February 2012.', ' Read MoreWelcome home: ‘Made in USA’ on the  rise', '  Back then, Burnett and Menendez were just beginning to wonder how  they could find enough manufacturers to make Maker’s Row a  success. It was a tough sell at first, but they began to  list manufacturers on the site for free, which turned out to be a  smart move because some of them saw almost immediate results.', '  “People started to see leads before Maker’s Row asked them to  sign up for their service,” according to Mitch Cahn, who runs  Unionwear, a maker of baseball caps and bags in Newark, New  Jersey. With leads in hand, it became much easier for Burnett and  Menendez to sign up other manufacturers.', '  “We get several inquiries a day from Maker’s Row,” said Cahn, who  bought a former baseball cap factory in nearby Jersey City in 1992, when, he said, there were about 400 baseball cap  manufacturers in the United States. These days, he said, there are  only about four but he believes the playing field for domestic  manufacturers has leveled because the cost of labor overseas is  climbing dramatically, making “Made in USA” more of a reality,  than a lofty ambition. “There had been interest before but it was  really a lot of talk,” he said. “Now that the price differential  is so much smaller, people are saying, ‘Hmmm, I may spend another  20 percent to get a product ‘Made in the USA.’ Five years ago, it  might have been another 100 percent.”', '  Local governments have gotten on board to help Maker’s Row,  hoping to help their local manufacturers at the same time.  They’ve had a large number of sign-ups in Los Angeles and Chicago, too. In about two years they’ve signed up approximately 5,000  manufacturers. A good thing, because there are also about 50,000  brands using the site to look for help. Subscriptions to Maker’s  Row begin at $25 a month.', '  It’s a similar story at Genil Accessories in Brooklyn, where Gina  Bihm and her staff make bow ties and neckties for the likes of  Vineyard Vines and Marc Jacobs. Despite her big-name clients,  Bihm says she also tries to help the little guy create a sample, if they can find her. “I don’t turn away no one. No one,” she  said.', '  Bihm said the recession that began in 2007 nearly put her out of  business. At the time she was shipping out about 20,000 pieces  per year. In 2008 and 2009 work was hard to come by. Her entire  staff, once numbering about 20 full-timers, was cut to zero. She  needed a loan to pay the rent on her work space. She still has  only 11 full-time employees, but she says business is better than  ever. With bow ties back in vogue, they’re making about 4,000  units per week now, and that was before she found Maker’s Row.  They’re practically around the corner from each other, but Bihm  only signed onto Maker’s Row during the summer. “The phone calls  doubled. I picked up about seven new customers and they all came  from Maker’s Row,” Bihm said.', '  The 2-year-old website also works for entrepreneurs, including Andrew  Kessler, Ari Klaristenfeld and Alexa Nigro, who began making  their scarf product, called the  “Scough,” with built-in carbon breathing  filters, by hand in Brooklyn last winter. Within  months they were having trouble keeping up with demand. They  looked two months for a manufacturer before trying Maker’s Row.  Two weeks later, they’d found MCM Enterprises, nearby in  Brooklyn.', '  “We found that it was cheaper for us to manufacture here in the  U.S. than it would be for us to produce in China or India,”  Klaristenfeld said.', '  “We’re starting to send thousands and thousands of Scoughs to  China which is this really interesting anomaly, where we’re  making something in Brooklyn and, uh, it’s going to China because  there’s brand, quality assurance that a lot of Chinese  manufacturers can’t get,” Kessler said.', '  Those are the same reasons that Burnett believes Maker’s Row has  seen some foreign businesses come online looking for U.S.  manufacturing. “We’re looking to change the rule of thumb,”  Burnett said. “We’re changing that mindset by showing people  where they can produce and manufacture locally because this is a  global shift right now.”', ' Read More', ' —By Andy Rothman.']"

Melissa Schilling, professor of management and organizations at NYU’s Stern School of Business, said the curve starts low and slow because “at first you don’t know what the hell you’re doing.” Companies experiment with designs, manufacturing methods, cope with failures and learn what works and what doesn’t. “You’re pumping a lot of money in, and you’re getting very little return,” Schilling said.', 'As processes and technologies improve and become standardized, performance improves relative to every dollar spent. This is where the dramatic breakthroughs happen — cellphones became incredibly light and small once batteries shrank in size and increased in power.', 'The S-curve has major implications for Tesla’s plans to make electric cars a mass consumer phenomenon. In the letter released with its earnings on Wednesday, results that pushed shares of Tesla higher, Musk wrote:', '“Model 3 drive units as well as battery packs made with our proprietary 2170 form factor cells are being built on new lines at Gigafactory 1. We are now fine-tuning these manufacturing lines to significantly increase the production rate. We wish we could do all of this faster and get everyone’s Model 3 to them right away. It’s important to understand that our production ramp will follow an S-Curve, meaning that it will begin slowly, grow exponentially, then start to tail off once we achieve full production.”', 'Musk said on the Wednesday earnings call that there should be “zero” concern about Tesla reaching its Model 3 production target.', 'More from iCONIC:The crucial decision Elon Musk made when he was flat broke5 things Elon Musk needs to do now to help Tesla grow upThe guy who makes millions selling fruit to Elon Musk’s workers', 'The S-curve starts to level off when the technology reaches maturity: “As you start getting to the top, you’ve picked all the low-hanging fruit,” Schilling said. “Now [you] need to spend a lot more to get further.”', 'It’s even possible to perpetuate the curve: Companies that reach maturity and see innovations slow relative to investments can instead plow that money into introducing a brand-new technology or product, creating a new S-curve to follow.', 'There’s a catch, however: S-curve-wise, the new product will always perform worse than the incumbent product at its peak.

It’s like a really jagged sort of upward growth.”', 'The trick is to keep pumping money into a model until it can dramatically improve the process and technology — and create a new model line once a previous one reaches its peak.

Workers in blue uniforms and helmets  still do some of the welding, but much of the process has been automated.', 'The state-of-the-art factory exemplifies the vast transformation that has taken place across manufacturing in China. General Motors opened a similarly ultra-modern Cadillac factory in the eastern suburbs of Shanghai, as well as one in Wuhan. Other automakers are also pouring billions of dollars into China, now the world’s largest auto market.', 'Robots are critical to China’s economic ambitions, as Chinese companies look to move up the manufacturing chain. The Ford assembly plant is across the street from a robot-producing factory owned by Kuka, the big German manufacturer of industrial robots that  a Chinese company bought last summer.', 'For carmakers, the reliance on robots is driven partly by cost. Blue-collar wages have soared because multinational companies have moved much of their production to China even as its labor force is rapidly changing. The combination of the one-child policy, which cut the birth rate through the 1980s and ’90s, and an eightfold increase in college enrollments has cut by more than half the number of people entering the work force each year who have less than a high school degree and  may be willing to consider factory work.', 'Blue-collar wages are now $4 to $6 an hour in large, prosperous cities, though still far lower than in the United States.', ' Automation is also a competitive necessity. As carmakers jockey for customers’ attention, they have no choice but to deploy the latest technologies, even in research and development. The challenge is how to keep a competitive edge, while trying  to prevent  intellectual property from being copied quickly by Chinese rivals.', '“We’re basically building an R&D center here in China, and test track, that is on par with other parts of Ford,” in North America, Europe and Australia, said Mark Fields, the chief executive of Ford Motor. At the same time, he said, the company would protect its intellectual property.', 'Robots perform tasks like welding in exactly the same way every time, improving quality control. But they require a lot of fine-tuning along the way.', 'The painting process is also mostly automated. Elaborate spraying robots, their joints covered in many layers of plastic so that they do not become clogged with paint mist, snake back and forth across each car body. Workers still apply protective sealant to the vehicles’ interiors and underbodies, as Ford has been leery of depending entirely on robots for this step until it is sure they work well. More robots are scheduled to be installed in August, replacing manual labor for the protective sealant step as well.', 'Automation doesn’t elicit the  same fear of job losses in China as in the United States. With car demand in China growing quickly, ever more factories and workers are needed to produce more cars. The Ford factory here in Hangzhou may have 650 robots, but it also has 2,800 workers. Other automakers continue to hunt for skilled workers to fill vacancies in their factories.', '“Robots aren’t the threat,” said Paul Buetow, the director of China manufacturing at General Motors. “The threat is not being able to run your business with products that people want to buy.”']"

At that time, coal and steel were considered the ultimate instruments of war, and their common management meant a guarantee of peace and reconciliation on a devastated and impoverished continent.', 'A few years later, the success of the French-German coal and steel venture led to a truly epochal event: A customs union among France, Germany, Italy and the three Benelux countries, enshrined in the Treaty of Rome in March 1957. Officially, that customs union was known as the European Economic Community, but most people called it quite correctly the Common Market.', 'At a stroke of a pen, the Europeans created the world’s new political entity, exercising its power through a quasi-free trading regime within the six countries, with a porous trade wall toward the rest of the world.', 'The political character of the customs union logically followed from a common regulatory framework to manage free trade and to coordinate economic policies, while maintaining unified trade and economic relations with the outside world.', 'Having no doubt about the political dimension of the customs union, the British decided to stay out of a community of nations “determined to lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe” – the key statement in the preamble to the Treaty of Rome.', 'Almost twenty years later, London changed its mind and joined the booming customs union, thinking that “opt-outs” would limit its membership to a free-trade area without large sovereignty transfers to European institutions.

A great deal of calm and wisdom will be required to overcome that dangerous obstacle to an apparent French-German determination to work together.', 'But there are two things that France and Germany share in their analysis: (a) the European Union is totally sidelined on the world stage, and (b) the recognition that the two countries – acting alone — cannot defend their vital economic and political interests.', 'So, what should they do?', 'The answer is simple: A French-German effort is needed to create a flourishing EU economy. That would provide the best foundation for the union’s stronger political structure.', 'Predictably, that objective is now beyond reach in a moribund EU economy, where sluggish growth and high unemployment are wasting human and (physical) capital resources.

On the verge of tears, she told the dozens of people in her group that she was leaving the company to explore new ideas on her own, according to former Building 8 employees.', 'It was shocking, not only because Dugan had come on board just 18 months earlier, but because Building 8 was leading Facebook’s effort to get into the hardware game, where CEO Mark Zuckerberg was desperate to play. When he announced the hiring of Dugan in April 2016, Zuckerberg said Facebook would “be investing hundreds of people and hundreds of millions of dollars into this effort over the next few years.”', 'Dugan’s departure marked a huge setback for Facebook, which has repeatedly struggled to break into hardware while its big tech rivals Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft have found various ways to succeed, whether through popular consumer electronics like the iPhone and Xbox or streaming devices and voice assistants from Amazon and Google.', 'In December 2018, just two and a half years after its inception, Building 8 was stripped apart, with the core of the group becoming Portal. That product, the only gadget launched publicly by Building 8, is a video-calling device that’s failed thus far to gain traction in a highly competitive market.', 'Building 8′s experience highlights Facebook’s central quandary as it seeks to diversify beyond mobile ads, which account for 93% of revenue, and expand into the costly business of developing, manufacturing and selling consumer devices. Coding is Facebook’s DNA, but the company’s hacker culture clashes with the realities of hardware development, which demands longer time horizons and relationships with a wide swath of manufacturers and resellers, all issues well beyond Facebook’s core.', 'Furthermore, as the company continues its effort to develop Portal, it has to contend with a deterioration of trust among consumers following a host of privacy scandals that make it difficult to lure customers into buying a Facebook-branded camera for their living room.', 'There’s a lot of money at stake. The smart home market, which includes speakers and entertainment products, is forecast to reach $151.4 billion in revenue by 2024, up from $76.6 billion last year, according to a Research and Markets report from January. The analysis doesn’t include Facebook among the more than three-dozen companies listed as potentially key players.', 'In reporting on Facebook’s hardware challenge, illustrated by the rise and fall of Building 8, CNBC spoke with more than a dozen former employees from the team who requested anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak about their experiences.', 'Dugan declined to be interviewed for this story.', 'Dugan, who has a PhD in mechanical engineering from Caltech, gained recognition in the tech industry for her work at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, where she was a director from 2009 to 2012.

At the time, Pichai was product chief but ran day-to-day operations and was eventually promoted to CEO in August 2015. Dugan lost some of her direct access to Pichai when Google hired former Motorola President Rick Osterloh to come back as senior vice president of hardware in April 2016.', 'That’s about the time Zuckerberg was looking to expand Facebook’s hardware efforts, which had been mostly limited to the acquisition of virtual reality headset maker Oculus two years earlier. Following Amazon’s success with its Echo speakers, Zuckerberg wanted Facebook to have its own smart home device, former Facebook employees said.', 'In her public departure note from Google, Dugan wrote a 450-word Facebook post, calling it a “bittersweet day” but expressing her excitement to do what she loved most.', '“Audacious science delivered at scale in products that feel almost magic,” she wrote. “A little badass. And beautiful. There is much to build at Facebook... and the mission is human... compelling.”', 'One of the first things she did upon arriving at Facebook was to look for early-stage projects that had potential to blossom. She found a prototype with the code name Little Foot, an iPad placed on a motorized base that could detect a person in the room and swivel in that direction.', 'With Zuckerberg pushing his company to prioritize video, Building 8 decided to use Little Foot as the basis for a consumer video-calling device. The team worked with award-winning photographer and documentary filmmaker Lucian Perkins to develop a feature that allowed the device’s camera to focus on the speaker in the video frame.', 'The idea for the machine was to build a bridge that digitally cut the distance between loved ones — a portal. Building 8 experimented with the device’s size, testing versions as big as large-screen TVs. The ideal experience would be a wall-to-ceiling product, a former Building 8 executive said. By late 2016, the group had put together a prototype and demo to show Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer, who gave it the green light and told Dugan to bring the product to customers.', 'The eight in Building 8 represented the number of letters in Facebook.

That’s where, in June 2017, a select few employees showed up for b*8 Underground, a quarterly event intended to showcase Building 8′s work.', 'The exclusive invitations had arrived in the form of stainless steel slabs. To get into the event, attendees handed their invitation to a staffer, who put the slabs onto a machine programmed to cut the metal into a bottle opener.

Some staffers resented Building 8′s secretiveness — to enter the space you needed an escort. The group was spending lavishly, shelling out over $100 million a year on vendors, consultants and show-off events, according to two former executives.', 'There were also internal struggles. People who came from the hardware industry were shocked by Facebook’s unrealistic production timeline. The company expected Building 8 to ship its first product within a year, a fraction of the time it normally takes to develop hardware devices, former employees said. A Facebook spokeswoman disputed that fact and said Building 8 was not expected to ship products within that timeframe.', 'And then there was the Facebook stigma. Following the company’s role in enabling the spread of disinformation in the 2016 election, the team knew it faced a massive public trust and privacy problem.', 'Dugan’s pace of progress was a key source of friction between Building 8 and its parent company. She was working on two-year timelines, but in Aug. 2017, Facebook made a decision designed to speed things up.', 'Schroepfer announced that Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, a longtime vice president who had run the company’s ads and business team, would manage consumer hardware, including Oculus and Building 8. Bosworth was a Zuckerberg loyalist, having joined the company in 2006, but he had no experience in hardware.', 'As it turned out, that decision spelled the beginning of the end for Dugan. Less than two months later, she announced her sudden departure. Dugan’s former colleagues say it’s unclear if she was fired or quit, but over the following weeks many of her deputies followed her out the door.', 'Bosworth named Rafa Camargo, who had followed Dugan from ATAP, as the interim head. When it came to technological decisions, Bosworth offered little direction, former employees said.', 'Camargo told CNBC in an interview that Bosworth’s contributions are significant and that he’s responsible for the hardware, software, marketing, go-to market and manufacturing decisions behind all of the devices Facebook has released since the Oculus Go in May 2018.', '“It’s super difficult to launch products on time, in quality, in volume and in need of the market, and he’s leading it all,” Camargo said.', 'Amid Building 8′s turmoil, by early 2018 Facebook had a more existential problem on its hands that derailed any chance the company had of getting Portal to market on its accelerated timeline.', 'In March of that year, multiple publications reported that Cambridge Analytica, a London-based political consulting firm, had improperly accessed the data of up to 87 million Facebook users, a scandal that would send the company’s stock spiraling downward and ultimately lead Zuckerberg to turn his attention to creating a “privacy-focused social platform.”', 'Within days, Bosworth told his team that Facebook had hit a low in terms of user trust and said it wasn’t the right time for Portal. He didn’t offer a projected launch date, and said the team was going to rethink the design.', 'Facebook’s spokeswoman told CNBC that Portal launched on schedule as the company’s plan was always to release the product in the fall of 2018. Multiple former Building 8 employees said the rollout was delayed numerous times.', 'Facebook finally released two Portal video-chatting devices in November, with the addition of camera covers so users could block the lens.', 'Portal immediately hit privacy snags. A week after telling Recode that no data collected by Portal would be used to target Facebook users with ads, the company walked back the statement and said that because Portal’s software was built on Facebook’s Messenger infrastructure, it collected the same type of type of data and could potentially be used to inform ads.', 'A month after the release, Camargo announced that Building 8 was no more and the group would now be known as Portal. In early 2018, the remaining research projects were moved to Oculus Research, which has since been rebranded as Facebook Reality Labs, based in Redmond, Washington. That’s where the company is working on a brain-reading interface — a noninvasive wearable device that will allow people to type using their thoughts.', 'Portal sales have been so disappointing that Facebook has slashed prices multiple times. According to IDC, the company has shipped just over 54,000 Portal devices since its launch (The Information first cited this data). Michael Levin of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners described Portal’s market share and consumer awareness as “immaterial.”', ' Facebook’s representative said the IDC number is inaccurate but wouldn’t provide an official figure. Camargo said Portal has exceeded Facebook’s expectations both in sales and user engagement.', '“We’re quite excited about it,” he said.', 'In April, CNBC confirmed that the company is developing a voice AI assistant that could be used in future Portal devices as well as Oculus headsets and other projects. Bosworth said at the Code Conference in June that the company plans to launch multiple new versions of Portal later this year, and Camargo told CNBC that Facebook is working on new augmented reality products. Through the experience of Building 8, Facebook learned what it takes to consistently build multiple, complex, high-quality products, he added.', 'One of the expected future devices is a project with the code name Ripley, which Cheddar previously covered and CNBC confirmed with former employees. Ripley is a small device with a built-in camera designed to sit on top of a TV, turning it into a Portal screen.', '“Hardware is coming to the home,” Bosworth said at Code Conference. “We want to make sure that human connection, connection between two people, is a first-party experience on that hardware.”', 'WATCH: Here’s how to see which apps have access to your Facebook data — and cut them off', 'Follow @CNBCTech on Twitter for the latest tech industry news.']"

All of those are goods traditionally exported from China to the United States.', '“Vietnam is clearly benefiting from the trade war and is emerging as an alternative favorite for companies,” said a report produced by Dezan Shira & Associates in April.', 'Harding echoed that assessment, adding that, among the many Southeast Asian countries trying to take advantage of the trade war, “Vietnam has clearly been the winner.”', 'The increase in Vietnamese exports can also be largely attributed to free trade agreements the country has strategically entered into over the last few years.', 'That includes the multinational Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is the updated version of the now-defunct Trans-Pacific Partnership. When Trump pulled out of the 12-nation TPP, apparently resigning the deal to history’s wastebasket, Hanoi was deeply disappointed, according to Harding.', 'Still, he told CNBC, Vietnam has nevertheless benefited significantly from the reworked 11-party pact, especially from having access to Canadian and Mexican markets.', 'Storm clouds may be gathering, however, Harding warned. A surging U.S. trade deficit with Vietnam means the Southeast Asian country should be worried because there “is clearly a risk for the overall relationship, given President Trump’s perspective on bilateral trade balances.”', 'The U.S. Commerce Department announced on Tuesday that it will impose duties of up to 456% on certain steel imported from Vietnam, specifically referring to steel products that are made in South Korea or Taiwan and then shipped to Vietnam for minor processing and final exportation to the United States.', 'In fact, Trump recently upped the rhetoric on Hanoi, telling an interviewer that “Vietnam is almost the single worst — that’s much smaller than China, much — but it’s almost the single worst abuser of everybody.”', 'Hanoi now seemingly has a target on its back, but Harding said the country isn’t at risk of White House-induced economic disaster.', '“If Trump does begin to talk seriously about tariffs, Vietnam will not be caught off guard,” he said, adding that the government there has “navigated the Trump administration quite well.”', 'While the new trade deal apparently represents a solid victory for Vietnamese exporters, it also signals that Europe is serious about diversifying its trade relationships.', 'The bilateral trade and investment negotiations between the EU and Vietnam were launched in 2012 and finalized in 2018. That pact, along with the bloc’s recent deal with Southeast Asian city-state Singapore, makes for for what EU officials described as “stepping stones to a greater engagement between the EU and the region.”', 'Looking at the bigger picture, Southeast Asia is the EU’s third-largest trading partner after the U.S. and China, so any free trade advancements in the region are significant for the bloc.', 'As for Vietnam, the European Chamber of Commerce in the country predicted that, “over the implementation period, Vietnam’s economic growth will be around 7% to 8% higher than if the (new trade pact) had never entered in force.”', 'According to a survey conducted by the European Chamber of Commerce in Ho Chi Min City, over 90% of respondents believed the sooner the two parties could formalize the implementation of the agreement, the faster it will benefit businesses operating in Vietnam.', 'The chamber said in an email to CNBC that its members believed the free trade agreement would have a positive impact beyond just economics. In fact, the trade deal will be able to bolster social and environmental issues as well, it said.', 'The success with the EU may also spur even more international interest.', '“So long as Vietnam remains the only Southeast Asian manufacturing hub with preferential access to the EU, it will attract even more interest from foreign investors,” said Harding.', '– CNBC’s Yen Nee Lee and Reuters contributed to this report.']"

64,$2.5 billion railway is being built for Florida...in California,2016-06-10T13:12:23+0000,"['  Florida Gov. Rick Scott visited California in May, hoping to  lure away dissatisfied business owners from high-tax California  to the low-tax Sunshine State.', 'Now, a company in Florida behind the first privately funded U.S. high  speed railway is manufacturing its trains ... in California. ', 'The world is upside down. ', 'The company building the railway is Brightline, owned by Fortress  Investment Group. It’s taking a huge gamble that high speed rail  is a concept whose time has come. “Everybody loves trains,” said  Brightline President Mike Reininger. ', '  Reininger might seem an unusual guy to be running a railroad. His  resume includes 12 years at Disney, where he  spent much of his time developing resorts. Another  Brightline executive came from MGM Resorts. Their goal with the  new railway is to create a “hospitality experience” that will  mix state-of-the-art transportation with attractive train  stations offering retail and other amenities. ', '  Brightline cars will be decked out with comfortable seats, large  windows, aisles twice as wide as those on airplanes, hands-free  bathrooms cleaned regularly, outlets everywhere, free Wi-Fi, and  something called a “gap filler,” which allows you to walk onto  the train without stepping up or down. “The train literally  reaches out to greet you at the platform,” said Reininger. The  train will travel up to 125 mph to get you from Miami  to Orlando in three hours. ', '  Brightline raised $1 billion in equity and debt to launch the  first phase of the rail service, which will start next year  between Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. It will use  existing rail corridors, and the company is building stations on  land it already owns. A second phase to send trains to Orlando will cost another $1.5 billion. ', '  Reininger believes Brightline can capture at least 1 percent of  the estimated 500 million annual car trips between cities in  South Florida and Orlando. Ticket prices have not yet been  revealed, but he said they will be competitive with the cost of  driving. “At the end of the day, we know we’ve got to do one  thing. We have to change your behavior a little bit. We have to  convince you to get out of your car and get into what we consider  a smarter way to travel.” ', '  If the concept works in Florida, Brightline might look at other  markets in places like Texas or California. ', 'Brightline chose Siemens USA to build and maintain the first five  trains, though it won’t disclose how much it paid. Siemens is  doing that work in Sacramento. California happens to be trying to  build its own high speed rail, funded by taxpayers, with a total  price tag that could top $68 billion, nearly 30 times the price of Brightline’s Florida train.', '  The Siemens USA plant stands a few miles away from the California state  Capitol, where the political climate appears increasingly  antagonistic to manufacturing. That doesn’t bother Michael  Cahill, president of Siemens USA’s rolling stock division. He  said the company has been in the Golden State for 30  years. ', '  “One of the great things about California is the positive  spirit,” said Cahill. “In California there is an enthusiasm here  that is unmatched anywhere else in the country.” ', '  In fact, Siemens USA increased its 600,000-square-foot  manufacturing plant in Sacramento by 20 percent because of the  Brightline contract. The locomotives they’re building for Florida  will run on clean diesel, and the passenger cars are made of  stainless steel to make them resistant to rust. ', '  There are also a lot of other locomotives and rail cars being  built inside the Sacramento plant for other cities and states,  from San Francisco to Calgary, Washington state to Illinois. “Our  production is growing,” said Cahill. “We’ve added, compared to  last year, about 150,000 man hours of work in the  factory.” ', '  Cahill said another advantage of remaining in California is the  sun. “Up to 80 percent of the power we use is generated by solar  panels.”', '  One of the challenges, though, is the lack of skilled labor.  Welders are in high demand, so Siemens has started its own  training program to develop new talent. ', '  That new talent includes 23-year-old Denise Robertson, who could  be seen welding a new train car this week. Robertson used to  solder metal for jewelry, but she heard about the welding  training program and decided to sign up. “It opened up a whole  new world for me,” she said. “I learned you could actually make a  pretty good career in welding.” ']"

I don’t believe that the U.S. trade deficit is as big a problem as many say,” said Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, to CNBC Tuesday.', 'President Donald Trump has repeatedly voiced his concerns about his country’s trade deficits with several countries including China, and his administration is attempting to open up China’s economy to U.S. companies.', 'Since the president’s inauguration there have been fears a trade war may begin between the two countries, which would involve the introduction of tariffs and quotas on imports. Trump’s Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has previously said the president will take “bold action” to address Chinese steel imports entering the market.', 'McCaughan says this kind of tough talk appeals to the president’s base, but he added that Trump would “blame someone else” in the event of a trade war and any negative consequences.', '“That’s what politicians always do,” he said. “U.S. assets abroad tend to be very high return … Whereas foreign investment into the U.S. is in Treasury bonds. So the income from the American assets is way bigger than from the liabilities - if you look at it that way the capital account is structurally in surplus – you can’t have a trade surplus as well,” he added.', 'The world has been teetering on the brink of a trade war for some time and this could be the biggest risk for investors, McCaughan also added. He says tariffs on steel imports would be bad for markets.', '“As far as the market’s concerned, tariffs on steel would be very bad news, because it would run the risk of setting off a trade war,” he says.', '“If the administration gets riled up by its base into tariffs, then you have anti-trade agenda winning.”', 'China is the focus of trade deficit concerns because it is the U.S.’s largest trading partner and accounts for around half of the U.S. trade deficit. However, the administration may be limited in what it can do to China, according to a report by risk consultants Control Risks.', '“Trump’s options for inflicting severe and widespread economic pain on China are inhibited by legal, regulatory and legislative practicalities, including U.S. commitments under the World Trade Organization,” the consultancy said in a report published in February.', '“They are further constrained by the high likelihood of effective retaliation by China, particularly if he pursues more unilateral and unconventional options.”', 'McCaughan’s comments come after trade data from China disappointed markets. In July, exports from China grew 7.2 percent in dollar terms from a year ago and imports rose 11.0 percent in dollar terms. Both were much lower than expected.', 'Despite weaker-than-estimated growth, China maintained its trade surplus with the U.S. of around $25 billion. This trade gap is closely watched due to growing tensions between the two countries.', '“Chinese trade data for July disappointed market consensus expectations. Both yearly export and import growth moderated in comparison with the previous month, against expectations for remaining just as strong,” said Susan Joho, economist at Julius Baer, in an email to CNBC.', '“Export growth to the U.S. almost halved amidst tensions over China’s large trade surplus with the U.S.”', 'The reason for the relatively lackluster trade growth indicated that China is failing to switch the focus of its economy from manufacturing to consumption, according to McCaughan.', '“The reason growth is where it is in China has a lot to do with continued construction activity and that is not something that is long-term sustainable,” he said.', '“You run into debt problems very quickly if construction is what’s driving the economy.”', 'Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

The president has spent his time in office trying to rework trade relationships with major partners, saying changes such as the ones made to NAFTA will encourage American manufacturing and job creation in the U.S.', 'While the ITC study shows the deal would have positive benefits for jobs and economic growth, it underscores that the deal is hardly the “largest” trade agreement ever as Trump has boasted. Even some Republicans in Congress have called the USMCA more of a tweak to NAFTA than a major overhaul.', '“The miniscule projected gains in this long-awaited official government assessment of the revised NAFTA contradict Donald Trump’s grandiose claims that it will lead to ‘cash and jobs pouring into the U.S.’ and reinforces congressional Democrats’ views that absent more improvements, the revised deal won’t stop NAFTA’s ongoing damage,” Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch, said in a statement to CNBC.', 'A separate report from the U.S. Trade Representative, part of the executive branch, projected the deal would have bigger effects on the auto industry specifically.
