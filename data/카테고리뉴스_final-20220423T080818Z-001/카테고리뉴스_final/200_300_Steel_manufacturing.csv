0,India’s $62 billion sanitation economy is fueling entrepreneurs in renewable energy,2019-12-15T14:10:24+0000,"['Several large multinational companies, including Kimberly Clark, Unilever and Lixil, recently gathered in India with the World Bank, various NGOs and government officials to meet with sanitation entrepreneurs, or sanipreneurs, to address the worldwide sanitation crisis. Their goal: to come up with new ways to turn human waste into valuable resources, including renewable energy.', 'While toilets and indoor plumbing are taken for granted in developed countries, in the developing world — India, parts of Africa or Southeast Asia — it’s not a given.', 'According to the Toilet Board Coalition — a business-led partnership created to address the global sanitation crisis — an estimated 2.3 billion people around the world lack access to toilets, which traditionally has been financed by taxes, well-intentioned nonprofits or corporate largesse.', 'The coalition plans to change that by accelerating the Sanitation Economy, a marketplace of products and services, renewable resource flows, data and information that they claim could transform future cities, communities and businesses.', 'This crisis has fueled a growing number of companies and sanipreneurs to come up with ways to turn human waste into a profitable business — and a big one at that. In India alone the sanitation economy could be worth $62 billion by 2021, the Toilet Board Coalition estimates.', 'Creating and maintaining sanitation systems is typically an expensive proposition, but by creating new models for sanitation, companies see a chance to turn what was once an unaffordable cost for governments into a profitable and scalable business opportunity. Typical sanitation systems cost an average of $200 per person, but the Toilet Board Coalition sees a chance to transform that cost to a net value of $10 per person.', 'To create a business, companies are finding ways to use and reuse resources, in this case human waste.', '“What goes down the toilet … it’s a combination of biological materials, water — all resources — provided you can treat the waste,” said Sandy Rodger, chief operations officer at the Toilet Board Coalition, calling it a toilet resource, adding, “As long as you can use it, creating valuable materials, that brings a revenue stream.”', 'So what does a profitable business look like when it comes to toilets?', 'First, cut down on infrastructure. Companies have come up with sanitation systems with limited pipes that run to a small, local processing plant, or no pipes at all. Next, create a source of revenue. In the “circular sanitation economy,” what goes in the toilet eventually becomes a finished product such as fertilizer or gas. There are even companies that are exploring ways to use digital technology and data collection to provide real-time monitoring of sanitation systems or even insights on health and consumer behavior.', 'At the recent Sanitation Economy Summit in India, the Toilet Board Coalition brought together large companies such as Unilever, Kimberly-Clark and Lixil with sanitation start-ups on specific projects through its toilet accelerator program.', '“Sanitation is an underdeveloped space for social enterprises, so the creativity and commitment of the entrepreneurs working with the toilet accelerator is particularly inspiring,” Lisa Hawkes, sustainable behavior change manager for Unilever, said in a statement released by the Toilet Board Coalition. Unilever worked with Garv Toilets, which manufactures stainless-steel toilets that are powered by solar panels and equipped with bio-digester tanks.', 'Another company in the accelerator, Tiger Toilets, is working with Lixil, owner of American Standard and Grohe, to create toilets that use tiger worms to break down human waste. The worms feed on human waste and convert it to almost potable water and fertilizer.', 'Toilets need very little maintenance and need to be emptied only every eight to 10 years — less than conventional pit latrines, which need emptying every two to three years. Through the accelerator program, Tiger Toilets has been working with Lixil for help with product design, supply chain, marketing and business development. The toilets are available in India now and are sold to charities as well as direct to households. A toilet package, which includes the toilet structure as well as the worms needed to break down the waste, costs between $300 and $390.', '“Lixil believes in supporting new innovations that can contribute to the global goals, particularly in sanitation. Partnership is essential to getting these innovations into the homes and communities of those who need it most,” said Erin McCusker, chief strategy officer of SATO, Lixil, and chairwoman of the Toilet Board Coalition.', 'Another company, Ti Bus in India, is converting old buses into toilets. It costs about $18,000 to convert one unit and an additional $800 a month to maintain, including paying the salary of a full-time attendant. The buses, painted bright pink, are a much needed facility for low-income women and children who might otherwise walk miles to find a safe, quiet spot outdoors to do their business. There are now 10 buses in India. About 70 to 100 women and children use the buses on a daily basis.', 'Through the accelerator, Ti Bus is working with Swiss fragrance company Firmenich to learn about consumer marketing. “We now have a greater understanding of who our customers are, how they behave and how best to engage them,” said Ulka Sadalkar, co-founder of Ti Bus.', 'It costs 5 rupees to use the Ti Bus. The buses also have additional revenue streams — some have a cafe, laundromat or offer health services. Buses may also get revenue for advertising on or in the buses. Sadalkar said that while the company is not making a profit yet, four of the buses are breaking even.', 'It’s still early days for sanitation as a business, but Venugopal Gupta, director of the Toilet Board Coalition’s accelerator program, says he is seeing a shift away from grants or donations to more commercial-grade investment in the space.', '“Those changes are welcome. These are not grants or donations. Now you are seeing impact investments with return expectations,” Gupta said.', 'What’s driving these investments is a huge market opportunity. Increasing urbanization worldwide is aggravating sanitation issues, which in turn creates environmental degradation that pose a threat to public health. There are large pockets of demand for the likes of Tiger Toilets or Ti Buses in Africa and India.', 'Not only that, but with sanitation the market is steady. “The demand is recession-proof and not prone to volatility or recessions or booms. It is quite a stable demand, and it’s a huge market,” said Gupta.']"
1,"Elon Musk’s biggest challenge yet: Recharging Buffalo, NY",2015-06-11T14:30:00+0000,"['  Elon Musk has earned a reputation as a man not afraid to take big risks and tackle big challenges. But is the touch Musk has shown in building a manufacturing empire for the 21st century—from SpaceX rockets to Tesla Motors electric cars and batteries—ready to help put a shine back on a depressed U.S. manufacturing city?', 'We’ll soon find out. ', 'SolarCity, the nation’s largest seller of residential solar-power systems—of which Musk is chairman—is  building a giant plant in Buffalo, New York, to make rooftop solar panels at a long-shuttered  Republic Steel plant.', 'Henry Ford had River Rouge; Musk and SolarCity have a Buffalo solar panel manufacturing plant named Riverbend.', '  As the factory rises, a promised 5,000 jobs are just beginning to  materialize. But it’s not just a bet on Buffalo. How far the  solar panel plant can go will also determine how well the  domestic solar manufacturing industry can reclaim share after much of it was unable to survive the first half of this decade in a market  roiled by steep price cuts and a trade war against Chinese solar  panel makers. ', '  SolarCity, like many of the rooftop solar installers, grew its business for years by using cost-effective panels, including those made in Asia. The Buffalo plant is set to open next year and will employ at least 1,900 people once  operating at full capacity in 2017.', '“You have a brownfield that has had no meaningful activity for years and you put in 3,000 jobs, not counting [its impact on] the local dry cleaner and mini-mart owner,” said Peter Cutler, director of communications and special projects at Empire State Development in Buffalo.', 'Read MoreThe cover-up involving a big loss of US jobs', 'Roughly 1,400 people are  expected to work for suppliers, and another 2,000 supplier jobs  are estimated to be generated in the rest of New York, said Alain Kaloyeros,  president of the State University of New York Polytechnic  Institute, who led the New York side of negotiations for the  SolarCity incentive package.', '  “For [local] manufacturing, this is a gain of more than 5  percent, and Buffalo still has an outsized concentration of jobs  in manufacturing,″ said Adam Kamins, a regional economist at  Moody’s Analytics. “To boost that with a modern industry is  significant. If Buffalo can become a leader, which it’s  positioned to do, an investment like this can pay off.″\u2063      ', '  About 400 construction workers are building the plant now, a  total expected to approach 1,500 late this year as the interior  gets built out, said Frank Ciminelli, senior executive vice  president of construction firm LPCiminelli, which is building it. ', '  “Something a tenth of this size would be noteworthy,” Ciminelli  said. “For a city whose psyche has been battered for as long as  I’ve been alive, the site of multiple cranes on the skyline  changes people’s perspective. Even before it’s been realized, it  has changed the psyche of the city.″', '  The plant will make enough panels each year to produce a gigawatt  of electricity, or a little more than 1 percent of the nation’s  power. That’s slightly more than all the panels SolarCity buys  now from outside manufacturers, but if the company maintains its  historical 80 percent annual growth rate, the demand will be  there by the time the plant hits full capacity, said SolarCity CEO  Lyndon Rive, who is also Musk’s cousin.', 'Read MoreRobot war is coming to US—on the manufacturing floor', '  “My goal would be to do five gigawatts after this one,” said  Rive, a goal New York officials say he and Musk share.  Rive said the expansion would have to be at a bigger site than  the Republic plant, but likely in the same area. “It sets up the  state to be the solar capital of the country. It creates  manufacturing, it creates a market, and it creates infrastructure  for how clean-energy companies will work together.″', '  The panels will be based on new technology innovated by Silevo, a  company SolarCity bought last June for $200 million, plus  incentives tied to how many panels the company can produce. The  panels work by adding more layers of semiconductor material to  existing technology and should be about 30 percent more  efficient than most of what the company uses now, SolarCity  spokeswoman Kady Cooper said.', '  As aging Rust Belt cities go, Buffalo has been in better shape  than many.', '  Despite losing 10,000 manufacturing jobs in the last decade, the  metro unemployment rate is 5.5 percent, exactly the national average.  (By contrast, Detroit is at 6.2 percent.) But the city is part of a relatively  depressed upstate belt New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wanted to help  out when he came to office in 2011. By 2012 the governor  announced the so-called Buffalo Billion plan to pour $1 billion  into economic development plans that now include an IBM  500-worker software research facility and offices for biotech  contract researcher Albany Molecular Research.', '  SolarCity’s plant is part of a construction push in the Nickel  City unlike any in memory, as money from the state and from  natural-gas fracking baron and Buffalo Bills and Sabres owner  Terry Pegula drives new and coming developments, including a  children’s hospital and a medical school complex.', '  Silevo became the linchpin of the plan after New York officials  spoke with more than 50 companies, said Kaloyeros, a  nanotechnology expert who has run New York’s push to attract  semiconductor-related businesses to the Albany area. Silevo, it  turned out, was for sale: The winning bidder was SolarCity, who  turned what had been contemplated as a plant making enough panels  to generate 30 megawatts of power per year into something much  larger.', '  In return for its large investment, New York wanted  guarantees—and protection—built into the incentive  deal. Instead of giving SolarCity cash, New York is paying for  the $350 million factory and an estimated $400 million of  equipment.', '  The state is keeping ownership of both plant and machinery to  discourage SolarCity from moving, even at the end of the 10-year  deal. SolarCity is expected  to invest $6 billion locally, including operating costs, over the  term of the deal, Kaloyeros said. Cutler said the deal requires  at least $5 billion in investment from SolarCity.', ' Read MoreWhy ‘Made in USA’  labeling is so complicated', '  Subsidies received by Musk-affiliated companies were  recentlynegatively  highlighted in a Los Angeles  Times piece. Musk fired back in an interview with  CNBC that incentives are helpful, but not necessary, and  that the incentives his firms receive pale in comparison to  subsidies given to other industries, including the oil and gas  industry. ', '  The deal also requires that SolarCity pay New York $42 million  for every year that the target of 5,000 jobs—including local  supplier jobs and solar installer jobs across the  state—isn’t met, Kaloyeros said. If it is met within the  four-year deadline and maintained for a decade as required by the  deal, the $750 million incentive package works out to roughly $150,000 per job,  or $15,000 per year, according to David Doyle, a spokesman for  Kaloyeros at SUNY Polytechnic. ', '  Since most of the positions are expected to pay from about  $50,000 to $150,000 (Erie County’s median family income is just  over $50,000), New York state income taxes on workers’ salaries  alone are likely to recover less than half of that money over the  initial term of the deal.', '  Doyle said SolarCity’s package does not exclude the company from  applicable state corporate income taxes. Personal and corporate  income taxes will recover some of the cost of the incentives over  the 10-year term of the initial deal. ', '  “Isn’t it worth it to revive Buffalo, to have the premier  facility of its kind in the world, and to retain ownership [of  the plant and equipment]?” Kaloyeros said. “I’d say yes.”', '  The plant is demanding enough specialized workers that  construction companies began alerting local unions a year ago,  giving them time to coordinate training, Ciminelli said. The  construction industry employs only about 15,000 people in metro  Buffalo, so a job this size demands preparation, he said. ', '  “We’ll empty the benches,” Ciminelli said. “In certain specialty  trades, we’re already importing workers.”', '  In addition, local community colleges are reworking job-training  programs to nurture the development of the hoped-for solar  manufacturing cluster, Kaloyeros said.', ' Read MoreHow Washington is really  hindering job growth', '  The state hopes it sets off a rush of other solar-industry  companies setting up shop in upstate New York looking to supply  Solar City. Whether New York made a good deal will depend on how  successful SolarCity is at convincing suppliers, and whether the  company expands its own plant beyond the 1-gigawatt production  target, said Kamins, the economist at Moody’s Analytics.', '  That’s going to happen, Kaloyeros insisted. In the Albany area,  about 350 chip companies have opened offices, drawn partly by the  presence of Sematech, a global consortium of semiconductor firms  that moved from Texas in 2010 and was merged into the Polytechnic  Institute this year. ', '  “The same thing will happen with SolarCity,″ he said. “If we’re  going to spend $1 billion, Andrew Cuomo is not going to spend it  for nothing.″\u2063', '  Two SolarCity partners are already in talks to move to Buffalo,  Kaloyeros said. And just this week, upstate New York-based  mechanical contracting company John W. Danforth said it plans to  spend $1 million to buy 26.6 acres of land across from the  SolarCity factory as part of a broader site that could include  SolarCity suppliers.', '  —By Tim Mullaney, special to CNBC.com']"
2,Trump tariffs would barely raise Boeing’s prices but could hurt sales,2018-03-07T12:25:32+0000,"['President Donald Trump’s plan to slap tariffs on imported steel and aluminum would barely budge the price of a Boeing jetliner or fighter plane, belying fears of a big blow to U.S. industry, aerospace analysts said.', 'What could have an impact is retaliation by countries such as China, one of Boeing’s biggest customers, if the United States goes through with threats to tax imported steel by 25 percent and aluminum by 10 percent, they said.', 'As one of the world’s largest manufacturers, Boeing provides a window into how double-digit tariffs on raw materials would translate into just a fractional uptick in the cost of finished goods. Boeing makes its planes exclusively in the United States, but nearly 70 percent of the 763 jetliners delivered last year went to customers outside the United States and 22 percent went to China.', 'Aluminum makes up 80 percent of the weight of older model planes such as the 737 and 777 but only about 12 percent of the cost, according to several experts with direct knowledge of Boeing. The rest is labor, overhead and other expenses.', 'A 10 percent aluminum tariff would increase the cost of a plane by about 1.2 percent if all of the aluminum is imported. But most of the aluminum Boeing uses is domestically produced, experts said.', '“These are big chunks of aluminum that are expensive to transport,” said Eric Redifer, a director in the aerospace practice of industry consulting firm AlixPartners.', 'He and others estimate only 25 percent to 30 percent is imported, leaving a net impact of about 0.3 percent of a plane’s cost.', 'Prices of domestic aluminum are likely to rise if tariffs are imposed, although it is unclear how much.', 'On a mid-sized 737, with a list price of $117.1 million, the cost increase could be less than $200,000, because airlines often receive discounts of 40 percent off list price, and Boeing’s profit margin is about 10 percent.', 'Boeing declined to comment.', 'The net effect for steel is similar, even though it makes up less of a typical Boeing plane, said Kevin Michaels, aerospace manufacturing expert at AeroDynamic Advisory, a consulting firm in Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'He estimated Trump’s 25 percent tariff on relatively pricey steel would cost U.S. aerospace companies less than $100 million, roughly on par with the overall impact on aluminum. That means the two tariffs would add $150 million to $200 million in cost, or at most about 0.2 percent of $100 billion worth of business jets, jetliners and military aircraft U.S. companies make each year.', 'For Boeing’s newer 787, which uses carbon-fiber composite for wings and fuselage, the impact is even less. Aluminum makes up 10 percent of the cost, Redifer said. The result: Trump’s aluminum tariff would increase 787 costs about 0.09 percent.', '“What will have a material impact is if China retaliates,” said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. “They are openly searching for ways to express their displeasure and apply leverage. And it doesn’t get any more obvious than going from Boeing to Airbus.”', 'The country’s thirst for jets is so great, however, that it likely will need planes from both Boeing and European rival Airbus to keep up with demand, analysts said.']"

He considered these small gains as a good start. Yet, at the same time, Ross also expressed that there exists a serious trade imbalance between U.S and China that needs to be dealt with.', 'According to National Bureau of Statistics in 2016, the  U.S. trade deficit with  China stood at $347 billion which accounted for 47% of the total goods trade deficit. However, in a report by China’s Ministry of Commerce, the 2016′s trade deficit was actually at $254 billion. It also cited that the American’s figures were exaggerated.', 'At the same time, the report also emphasized that in terms of service trade with China in 2016, the U.S. had a surplus that reached 55.7 billion dollars As such, what we see here is that there are clear differences between the statistics coming from America and China. Despite these differences, one thing that we can be sure of is that both countries reported data that recorded a decline from 2015′s and this downward trend has continued since the start of this year. For example, the data from the U.S Chamber of Commerce in February showed that US trade deficit with China went down by 26% but its China’s exports went up by 22%.', 'Besides, another point of discussion is the mutual opening up of various markets. Currently, China is the biggest US importer of aircraft and soybean and also the second biggest for cars, electronic integrated circuits and cotton. Here are some data. 62% of the total American soybean exports and 17% of American car exports are going into China. Furthermore, 15% of the total electronic integrated circuits, 14% of total American cotton and 25% of the total number of American speakers are also going into China.', 'However, China’s imports of high-tech products from the U.S only make up 8.2% of China’s total imports of similar products. Therefore, China does hope that there can be deeper discussion with regards to import products like aeroplanes, cotton, electronic beds and other high-tech products. Furthermore, stronger cooperation can be achieved between China and America in areas like energy, beef and agricultural products, manufacturing, films, tourism and even student exchange programs.', 'Looking forwards, analysts have expressed that discussion between the U.S and China is set to continue in the second half of this year and an important thing to be noted is impending tariff measures that are going to be imposed, especially on steel imports. Recently, Trump had expressed information on limitations and tariffs of steel imports will soon be unveiled. Last night, he once also expressed that tariffs on steel imports could happen and this might result in some uncertainty in the relations between U.S and China.', '[Nicholas Consonery, Senior Director&Head of Asia Political Risk, FTI Consulting] “The question is whats coming next. There is a sense that the two sides are going to agree to some kind of one year framework for further negotiations about trade. It is very clear that the Trump administration is looking to push over-capacity industries including steel, so I think we will see more trade tensions in the second half, manageable but more tension.”']"

Paul’s organization promotes U.S. manufacturing jobs, particularly in the steel and aluminum industries – and the White House’s focus on restoring old-line manufacturing, as well as recent attempts to crack down dumping these products in the U.S. would seem to directly align with their objectives.', 'Paul tweeted, simply, that resigning was the “right thing to do,” making no specific mention of the Charlottesville, Virginia, violence.

The council forged early deadlines for task forces on regulatory issues but hasn’t outlined its objectives since.', 'Perhaps they’ll dodge a mean tweet from the leader of the free world. Perhaps government contractors – like Lockheed Martin – won’t lose their seat to a competitor like Northrup Grumman, that’s not currently represented.', 'Or perhaps there’s a specific near-term goal for companies like 3M and Whirlpool, which rely on the North American supply chain as NAFTA gets rewritten, beginning imminently.', '—By CNBC’s Kayla Tausche.

I think there’s going to be an increase in AI and machine learning investments as a result of the pandemic and the Russian invasion.”', 'The other driver of bigger investments in supply chain technology is the growing set of risk factors that companies are facing. “If you compare the different risk indicators that a business uses today to five years ago, they are completely different,” says Trent. Many companies used to look primarily at financial risk on a global scale, he says.', 'Digital solutions, and AI-driven automation in particular, can give a company a far more complex and meaningful set of risk alerts, including the geopolitical implications that are now having such an oversized impact.', 'Tuning into “geopolitical risks relies on a lot of listening to open data and news sources and very quickly analyzing the sentiment coming out of certain regions of the world,” Trent says.

It’s going to be  detrimental to the crude’s price itself.” ', '  During the campaign, President-elect Trump’s energy plan focused  on expanding U.S. oil, gas and coal production. That effort comes  as the world is still working through a global glut of crude,  largely fueled by growing U.S. output, that has caused a two-year  oil price downturn.', '  U.S. coal consumption has been declining for years as power  plants shift to cleaner, cheaper natural gas. Clean air  regulations enacted by President Barack Obama hastened the retirement of some  coal-fired units.', '  “The coal industry itself has been resurrecting on its own, and  it’s going to do far better,” Gartman said. “Coal mines will be  reopened.

To learn more, CNBC asked the 21 top Democrats running for president about their views.', 'We asked them what they believe is working under Trump — and what they would change. We also asked whether human rights issues in China, where the U.S. has said more than a million Muslims are held in concentration camps, should be part of any trade deal. Lastly, we asked about what they would do about China’s efforts to tighten its military grip on the South China Sea, where more than $3 trillion of trade passes annually.', 'Below, unedited, are our questions and the answers we received from the seven Democrats who responded. Those Democrats are Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam and spiritual coach Marianne Williamson.', 'Two other Democrats provided partial responses.', 'A spokesperson for Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., provided an excerpt from the senator’s platform that is included as a response to the first question.', 'An aide to Texas Rep.

We must advance progress based on shared interests and core democratic values.”', 'Joe Biden, the Democratic front runner, did not respond to CNBC’s survey as of publication time but has dismissed China’s economic competitiveness while on the campaign trail, earning some criticism from his fellow contenders.', '“China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man,” Biden told a crowd in Iowa earlier this month.

If so, what action?', 'Sanders: It is in the interests of the United States to work to strengthen institutions like the WTO and the UN rather than trying to go it alone. American concerns about China’s technology practices are shared in Europe and across the Asia-Pacific.

China has not been forthright in even admitting that intellectual property theft and technology transfer occurs. Nor is China transparent on its industrial subsidies. Curbing China’s dishonest practices must be a part of any negotiation; as president, I would hold China accountable.', 'On the intellectual property theft, we know that much of the IP theft is state-backed. In order to combat this we must take a multi-pronged approach — both defensive and offensive.

In fact, the WTO has an obligation to enforce the rules they have set up, otherwise it is left to the United States to impose punishment. We should hold the WTO to its obligation.', 'It is also important that U.S. companies acknowledge when theft is occurring by China. In the past, companies have not wanted to impinge on their business with China so they’ve turned a blind eye. I would ensure that reporting this theft it is a win-win for American companies through fair trade practices.', 'Lastly, government departments must coordinate with each other and with U.S. companies.

The point is: WTO leverage works. China’s membership in the WTO has been a huge boon to the United States, with U.S. exports to China increasing by 500 percent and agricultural exports increasing by 1000 percent since China joined the organization.

We must use all tools at our disposal to ensure China respects intellectual property law. This will include working with and leveraging the power of the international community to make certain that China engages in fair trade.', 'The U.S. government must also enlist the help and cooperation from American businesses to help solve this problem.

If not, will your administration address human rights in China and, if so, how?', 'Sanders: Yes. Labor protections are very weak in China, and the rights of workers are an essential component of human rights. The Trump administration has proven itself indifferent to labor rights, and apparently would prefer that American workers are reduced to the position of Chinese workers, rather than that labor everywhere enjoy basic protections and strong standard of living. The Trump administration has also done nothing to pressure China over its abhorrent treatment of the Uighur and Tibetan peoples. Future trade negotiations should, for example, target American corporations that contribute surveillance technologies that enable China’s authoritarian practices.', 'Swalwell: Yes, a trade deal must have a component to address human rights activity. We must be a model for the world and call out countries such as China that violate human rights.', 'Ryan: Yes. As the United States negotiates any future trade deal with China, we must address the human rights violations. The actions we have seen from the Chinese government when it comes to the inhumane treatment of the ethnic minorities is inexcusable. And no future trade agreement can ignore these violations.', 'Delaney: Human rights are a priority to the Delaney Administration.', 'Moulton: Yes. Labor protections and human rights issues have long been part of U.S. trade agreements. These protections are critical. Enforceable labor protections and human rights standards not only improve the lives of people overseas, they protect jobs at home by leveling the playing field with American workers. During negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Obama administration compelled Vietnam to reform its labor rights to meet international standards on freedom of association and collective bargaining.', 'Unfortunately, Donald Trump seems dedicated to undermining our traditional leadership role on human rights by withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council. America needs to lead on human rights again.', 'Messam: YES', 'Williamson: The United States, just a few years ago, stood for human rights, even if we fell short, we worked to do better as a people. That commitment has been eroded, as we place short term profits over our rights and leadership to create a more perfect union. The United States should retain the mantle of the top human rights defender in the world. This means cleaning up its own house but also demanding that other countries adhere to the value of basic human dignity and human rights protection. The U.S. should use all tools at its disposal, whether it’s trade deals or diplomatic envoys, to promote and protect human rights in the world.', 'It is essential that we work with all of our foreign trade partners to ensure that all guarantee human rights for people across the globe. In the case of China, we should leverage our own trade power working alongside all of our allies to promote human rights when discussing trade.', 'What do you see in America’s current policy approach to China that is working? What is the single most important thing you will change? Who will benefit from your plan and how?', 'Sanders: While China has adopted some better practices, it still has a long way to go. The Trump administration is correct to put pressure on China to reform its practices, and I hope that some good comes from current trade negotiations. The economic relationship between the United States and China has been the engine of global growth for the past 25 years, and we should acknowledge that in China it has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. In both China and the United States, however, the benefits of this growth have not been shared equally, and have accrued in a very disproportionate way to the very wealthiest. The problem is that the Trump administration is mainly interested in addressing some of the imbalances between America and China overall, when it also needs to address basic drivers of economic inequality. The future of this relationship requires both a degree of pressure on China, and reform of the economy inside the United States itself.', 'Swalwell: I don’t think an all-out trade war with China is to our benefit. However, imposing targeted tariffs against China is a tactic that works to ensure fair trade. America wins when we have fair trade deals. Trump’s negotiating tactics have and continue to undermine any long-term deal that could be reach with China.', 'Again, in striking a deal we must work with our allies who share our concerns including Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. It is important that our allies hold up their end of any bargain and stand up to China when it comes to unfair trade practices.', 'I will negotiate a trade deal with China that’s globally beneficial for both countries but includes accountability. While the carrot and the stick approach might work in the short term, we must strike a long-term deal with China to reduce our trade deficit and provide a level playing for the future, including getting China to gradually open up their markets.', 'Ryan: The ad hoc approach to trade with China by the Trump administration has created an economic policy that has hurt many American industries while creating an unlevel playing field for our American workers. For too long China has succeeded in hurting America’s manufacturing industry by engaging in illegal steel and aluminum dumping. That is why I support targeted tariffs against China’s steel and aluminum.', 'However, the lack of strategy has created a reactionary trade policy that helps no one, and we cannot negotiate trade through tweets. I have been a long time supporter of taking action against currency manipulation, and leading legislation that would impose countervailing duties to offset the impact of manipulation. As president, I will prioritize America’s workers and industry – manufacturing, agriculture, and artificial intelligence.', 'Delaney: Our current policy is overly focused on the trade deficit, which is important, but not as significant as intellectual property issues. It also favors a “go it alone approach” – which is wrong. We should work with our allies. Our current policy is hurting our farmers; I will help farmers by entering TPP.', 'Moulton: First, we need to recognize that China poses an economic and security threat to the United States right now based on their cyberattacks and intellectual property theft. China will also be the largest near-peer competitor to the United States for the foreseeable future, so it is critical that we are willing and able to confront China and win. It is obvious that Donald Trump’s trade war with China isn’t the answer. It is hurting American farmers while China continues to steal American jobs every day through the internet with their cyberattacks designed to take America’s innovative ideas and military secrets. To confront China, we need to build a cyberwall to ensure that we can protect our intellectual property; negotiate a trade deal with our allies and partners in the region with strong labor and environmental protections that will deepen and strengthen our economic foothold across the Pacific; effectively use all of our diplomatic and economic levers to force China’s compliance with their trade and legal commitments; and finally we need to make significant government investments in next-generation technologies like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and green technology. Winning the competition with China means the next generation of technology will be designed and built in America, then sold to China and the rest of the world.', 'That said, China has shown that they are capable of acting responsibly on the world stage, especially when the United States demonstrates real leadership. China is a party to the Iran nuclear deal that provides clear incentives to block Iran’s path to a nuclear weapon. China also agreed to strict steps to address climate change as part of the Paris Agreement. China has also taken on a leadership role in addressing environmental issues at the UN, filling the leadership void left by the Trump Administration on addressing climate change. A constructive dialogue with China on security and environmental issues, while competing and winning on innovation and cybersecurity would have huge benefits for American workers, the entire U.S. economy, and on Asia-Pacific security.', 'Messam:', 'What do you see in America’s current policy approach to China that is working?', '· Negotiations for wider access for western firms.', '· Structural reforms to stop the Chinese government’s use of distortive regulations, subsidies, and JVs that force technology transfers and otherwise rig competition for the benefit of preferred, often state-owned or controlled businesses.', 'What is the single most important thing you will change?', '· Strong labor and environmental standards and enforcement of those laws and standards would be a high priority.', 'Who will benefit from your plan and how?', '· American Workers would benefit because American workers have suffered due to the lack of global labor and environmental standards not protecting international workers, putting American labor at a disadvantage where our domestic standards are not reciprocated internationally.', 'Williamson: The current administration’s purported desire to rein in terrible trade deals is a good goal. Standing up for the United States over trading partners who are acting in less than honorable ways is, on the surface, what a president should do. However, the combination of attempted bullying, erratic behavior and especially tariffs is highly counter-productive. We need to end the trade war which was started by an administration which was creating enemies to blame for our problems. This trade war has been hurting U.S. consumers with excess costs for goods and hurting U.S. farmers by making our agricultural exports less competitive and eliminating the Chinese market.', 'What will you do about China’s efforts to tighten its military grip on the South China Sea, where more than $3 trillion of trade passes annually?', 'Sanders: The U.S. has a role to play in supporting bilateral and multilateral diplomacy between China and others in the region to deescalate and handle disputes. The best policy in both the near and long term is to strengthen international institutions, in this case the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The United States should press China to abide by internationally agreed guidelines for managing maritime issues, in no small part by ratifying UNCLOS itself.', 'Swalwell: China has been slowly widening its military buildup and constructing island for military use. It is time that the U.S. lead in a more direct way. While we have been urging other allies to increase their presence in the area to help keep the waterways open, we have not yet formed a formal coalition with other countries including Australia, France, Japan, and England and the Philippines and Vietnam. My administration can lead these countries in joint exercises and other coalition-building activities, sending a clear signal to China that these countries will defend their rights to navigate the South China Sea.', 'Further, China must be held accountable in the eyes of the world. I would put the South China Sea at the top of an international agenda, so that the world becomes aware of China’s ruthless policies in this area. We should stand up for our friends in Southeast Asia. The more countries that are aware, the more heat China will feel both diplomatically and economically.', 'Ryan: The actions of China in the South China Sea is extremely concerning, and the militarization of the area is a national and economic threat to the United States. The actions by China combined with a lack of a comprehensive defense strategy by the United States continues to put the global trade that utilizes the waterway in jeopardy. We should make every effort to bolster our allies and other strategic partners in the region and strengthen their efforts to oppose China’s militarization of the South China Sea.', 'Delaney: We need to maintain our significant military presence in the Asia-Pacific region, invest heavily in the technology-based offensive and defensive weapons of the future, and work with our allies on initiatives like TPP.', 'Moulton: The most important thing that we can do is support our allies in the region. By failing to stand with our allies, Donald Trump is inviting countries like Russia and China to test our resolve. When I was in the Marines, we had a motto for our division: “No Better Friend, No Worse Enemy.” When China understands that we are committed to the region and the free navigation of the South China Sea, then we can work together to resolve disputes and ensure that trade is not disrupted. China has a huge economic stake in maintaining freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, but we need to have a president capable and willing to defend the United States and our interests in the region. I believe that we should be building a “Pacific NATO” to contain China and North Korea by formalizing and strengthening our security relationships with our allies in the region. In other words, exactly the opposite of what Donald Trump has done by cancelling our military exercises with South Korea and cutting our allies out of the negotiations with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program.', 'Williamson: Cooperation is key. When a country acts aggressively and in a manner that is not in our interest or the interest of peace in a region, the first place to start and hopefully end is working with allies to create a climate of peace. In the South China Sea, the best way to curb China’s expansion is to continue to strongly support our strategic and trade partners in the area and to engage the international community to assist in our efforts to prevent this expansion.']"

On Thursday China reported that gross domestic product grew 6.8 per cent in the third quarter, ahead of Beijing’s full-year target.', 'That rebound owes much to the confidence of homebuyers like Mr Yu and to projects like Ocean Flower Island. Housing prices and construction starts rebounded from a slump in 2014-15, boosting overall business investment and driving demand for output from China’s huge manufacturing sector.', 'The property sector has been given a helping hand. Urged on by Beijing, 38 per cent of all bank loans issued in the 12 months to August were home mortgages, according to official data, and local governments purchased 18 per cent of all residential floor space sold last year as part of a drive to provide affordable housing, according to estimates by E-House China Research Institute.', 'The result has been another heady boom in construction. Rome was not built in a day, but based on residential floor area completed last year, China built the equivalent of a new Rome about every six weeks.', 'With the surge in housing investment has come a round of questions about a potential bubble in the market and the implications for the long-term health of China’s economy.   Some economists and investors warn that short-term growth from the latest housing boom has come at a cost: inflating a property bubble whose eventual bursting will inflict great pain. A senior Chinese legislator recently warned in unusually blunt terms that the economy has been “kidnapped” by property.', '“The government keeps this market going. Last year, they needed to jump-start property so the economy would be in good shape for the party congress,” says Andy Xie, an independent economist and asset manager who has warned about a property bubble. “In the short term it works, but only if people believe the government will protect them.”', 'But others insist that fears of a bubble are overstated. On this view, economic fundamentals justify substantial investment in housing, especially in inland cities where development still lags far behind wealthy coastal areas. These more sanguine observers also note that outrageous price levels for Chinese apartments are mainly restricted to the megacities like Beijing and Shanghai.  Despite its importance, China’s real estate market has proved to be tricky for foreign investors and experts to grasp. Dire prophecies of a Chinese housing bubble have been a staple of economic punditry for at least a decade. In 2010, billionaire short-seller James Chanos called China’s property market “Dubai times 1,000”. But apart from a few cities, the market has experienced only mild corrections.', 'The stakes in this debate are high. Chinese residential property is arguably the world’s most important asset market. The sector drives global commodity prices, making the difference between growth and stagnation for resource exporters like Australia and Brazil.', 'For China’s domestic economy, the world’s largest at purchasing-power parity, property investment directly contributed 10 per cent to GDP in 2016. When manufacturing sectors like steel, cement and glass and retail sectors like furniture and home appliances are included, the share is at least 20 per cent. The health of China’s banking system, now the world’s largest by assets, is also deeply tied to the fate of the property sector.', 'Developments such as Ocean Flower Island are used on both sides of the debate. To some, it typifies the excesses of the market, which they say feeds on speculative demand in an already oversupplied sector. Evergrande is one of China’s most indebted developers.', 'However, the company has so far defied the sceptics.

So I would say that it is investment demand,” says Diana Choyleva, chief economist at Enodo Economics, a London-based independent research company focused on China.', 'Prominent business leaders and financiers have also expressed concerns about a bubble. Levin Zhu, son of former premier Zhu Rongji and former chief executive of investment bank China International Capital Corp, believes that all new residential construction is essentially oversupply.', '“According to the statistics bureau, if you add each year’s numbers together, China’s current total housing capacity can supply 1bn people at an average rate of 30 sq m per person. Counting even people living in small towns, China has only 700m urban dwellers. That means there is a 300m over-capacity,” he told a forum in June.', 'Further underpinning the bearish outlook is the belief that fundamental demand for new housing is drying up.', 'The extraordinary transformation of China’s economy over the past 40 years was driven by the migration of farmers into cities. That urbanisation process is now slowing, however, as relatively few young people remain in rural China.', 'The number of migrant workers living outside their home province rose by 12m in the five years through to June this year, compared with an increase of 26m in the five years ending June 2012, according to official data.', 'Says Mr Xie: “If you go into villages, there are no young and middle-aged people any more.

A year later it’s a totally different story,” says Shuang Ding, head of greater China economic research at Standard Chartered in Hong Kong.', 'Looking ahead, Mr Ding believes that fundamental demand can support the construction of about 6bn sq m of housing through to 2021, implying growth of about 5 per cent a year in residential property. That would be far below the boom years of the mid-2000s, when overall property investment grew 25 per cent a year on average, but it would still set a floor under growth that will put Mr Xi and the new politburo at ease.', 'Perceptions of unreasonably high housing prices appear to be disproportionately influenced by trends in first-tier cities — Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. All three rank among the world’s most expensive in terms of price-to-income ratio.', 'Of the 70 cities in the official price survey, however, 12 have seen outright price falls in the three years through to August this year.

He lambasted the North American Free Trade Agreement as  “the worst trade deal in history” and promised to renegotiate  better terms for NAFTA or withdraw from the deal altogether if  America’s partners do not agree.', '  He also took time to criticize the recently negotiated  Trans-Pacific Partnership, which he called the “death blow for  American manufacturing.” He said that China would enter the TPP  through a “backdoor” later on, and that if elected he would  withdraw the U.S. from the TPP given the deal has not yet been  ratified.', '  Matthew Slaughter, a professor of international business and dean  of Dartmouth’s Business School, said that trade agreements have  overall generated gains for America and that sitting on the  sidelines would lead to missing out on opportunities. He also  said many of Trump’s statements would not pass standards for  academic scholarly research.', '  “If the United States is not participating in global agreements,  the rest of the world isn’t going to stop negotiating them among  themselves,” Slaughter said. “What America needs is a much  stronger, smarter, better-funded social safety net so that we  don’t lose the benefits of trade.”', '  In both criticizing NAFTA and TPP, Trump sought to tie his  Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to the deals in her former  capacities as first lady and secretary of state. Clinton had  supported NAFTA as first lady, and served as Obama’s top diplomat  during TPP negotiations, though she has since backed away from  both policies.', '  During the length of the speech, Trump’s most strident remarks  were reserved for China. Calling China’s entry into the World  Trade Organization an enabler of “the greatest jobs theft in  history,” he said he would instruct his treasury secretary to  label China as a currency manipulator, and would have his trade  representative bring trade cases against the country — both  in the U.S. and the World Trade Organization.', '  However, some experts did not place much stock in his proposals.  David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and  former Treasury Department emissary to China, said that it would  be difficult to see how any economist would call China a currency  manipulator given the country has lately been intervening to keep  its currency high. He also noted that President Barack Obama’s  administration has pursued a high number of trade cases against  China.', '  “I don’t believe that taking a protectionist route is going to  make Americans more prosperous,” Dollar said.', '  Dollar, along with other economists, said there was no backdoor  in the TPP agreement for China to enter through, and praised the  proposal as one made among a group of countries with which the  U.S. has relatively balanced trade and promotes good jobs.', '  However, not all experts were in agreement that Trump’s proposed  policies were wrong-headed.', '  “Its unfortunate that Donald Trump is Donald Trump but he’s  really dead right on this issue,” said Peter Morici, a business  professor at the University of Maryland and former chief  economist at the U.S. International Trade Commission. “You might  not like his tone but he’s got it, he’s got it cold.”', '  Morici said the U.S. must renegotiate its current trade  agreements, and that doing so would create millions of jobs.

The central bank’s last action  was in February, when it reduced the RRR by 50 basis points.', '  “Data from the investment-industry nexus show that the  tried-and-tested stimulus measures of recent months have stirred  up the physical part of the economy, especially towards the end  of Q1, while consumption remained relatively robust,” Louis  Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, echoed in a  note.', '  Continued support could help Beijing hit 2016 GDP growth of 6.5  percent, within the government’s range, Kuijs  added.', '  But Ulrich did not expect the PBOC to unleash aggressive stimulus  anytime soon because the economy currently had upside  momentum. Policy would remain accomodative but the PBOC  would for more data before unleashing any immediate rate  cuts, she said.', '  China’s shrinking economy has long been a focus for global  markets, as President Xi Jinping engineers a structural slowdown  to re-orient the country way from manufacturing towards domestic  consumption and services. In recent months, motley batches of  data have soured sentiment but following a rough start to the  year, a host of key economic indicators are now pointing  upwards.', '  In March, exports  logged a sharp recovery, foreign exchange reserves posted  their first  monthly increase since November and the official  manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), which tracks  factory activity at large companies, returned to  growth for the  first time since July 2015.', '  Moreover, concerns about the yuan seem to have largely  dissipated. It fluctuated earlier this year as Beijing switched to  pegging the currency to a basket of its trading partners’  currencies instead of the dollar, but has since stabilized.', '  “The economy has shown signs of stabilization in recent weeks and  that’s helped global markets, risk appetite has improved and  currencies look stable, at least temporarily,” said Mitul Kotecha,  head of Asia FX and rates strategy at Barclays.', '  But others warn against undue optimism.', '  “The new economic data may be knocking the wind out of the  argument that the Chinese economy is heading for a hard landing,  but I believe it’s premature to think that the economy is  bottoming out. It’s far too early to start talking about a  V-shaped recovery. Sure, there are plenty of bright spots but there are some  genuine areas of concern,” said Kamel Mellahi, professor of  strategic management at Warwick Business School, referring to  structural reforms.', '  Dealing with the  growing pile of corporate debt, estimated at around 160  percent of GDP, and reducing overcapacity at state-owned  enterprises(SOEs) to boost productivity are two of the biggest  reforms on Beijing’s to-do list.', '  In a report this week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  warned that about $1.3 trillion of corporate bank loans were owed  by firms who did not earn enough to make interest payments. If  left unchecked, that could result in bank losses equal to 7  percent of GDP, the IMF said.', '  The most at-risk sectors included real estate, manufacturing,  retail, mining, and steel, where earnings relative to interest  expense have fallen despite declining nominal interest rates,  according to the IMF report.', '  Now that the economy has finally stabilized, this is an opportune  time for Beijing to push ahead with these reforms,  said JPMorgan Chase’s Ulrich.', ' —Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.']"

As far as the general tenor, it’s hard to see it more dovish than it was on Jan. 30,” said Michael Schumacher, director strategy at Wells Fargo.', 'The Fed, at that meeting, held rates steady and emphasized it could pause in its rate hiking cycle. In what felt like an about face from its December meeting, Powell also emphasized that the Fed would be flexible with its balance sheet. The Fed releases the minutes of its meeting Wednesday afternoon.', 'Positive comments on trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials, and a commitment to continue talks in the coming week helped boost stocks Friday and could continue to support the market in the week ahead.

The retail sales data was contrary to other reports from retailers and others that showed solid holiday sales, so Walmart’s comments about what it is seeing now as well as during the end of the fourth quarter will be important.', '“We’re going to watch them very closely, and that’s because of the retail sales number. The government shutdown, plus the market going down, everyone talking about a recession coming. Did people cut back spending a little bit? Was it real?” said Vinay Pande, head of trading strategies at UBS Global Wealth Management.', 'Walmart’s comparable store sales in the fourth quarter were expected to be up about 3 percent, and its earnings per share are expected to be flat at $1.33, according to FactSet.', 'Economists cut their expectations for fourth quarter growth to under 2.5 percent after the retail sales number, which was viewed as suspect by some. Goldman Sachs economists called the report an outlier, and said that as much of 1 percentage point of the drop is unexplained.', '“Some special factors likely contributed to the fall in core retail sales, including an early Thanksgiving, the December stock-market sell-off, and the start of the government shutdown,” it said.', 'So the coming week’s data will also be important, including weekly jobless claims Thursday, which were higher for a third week this past week. The concern is that rising claims could be an early warning sign of a slowdown in the labor market.', '“Unemployment claims are rising, at the same time employment growth and income growth are not suggesting this is the case,” said Pande.', 'Data on  existing home sales and unemployment claims are released Thursday.', 'Pande said the market broke out in the past week from a sideways trade it fell into earlier in the month. “Until last week, we just went back to the status quo of November,” he said, adding the sell off in December was way overdone. The market has been at an impasse between the lift from value, and the drag from what he called the idiosyncratic risks, like trade, the shutdown threat and other geopolitical risk.', '“I think the balance shifted a bit. The bad news on the idiosyncratic front is being overwhelmed by the less bad,” Pande said.', 'Pande said there’s a risk that investors will read the Fed’s minutes in the coming week a little more hawkish than it intends.', 'There could be discussion in the minutes about the balance sheet unwind, which some traders fear has been making markets less liquid.', 'At the Jan. 30 meeting and before, Powell had backtracked on a comment he made after the December meeting that the unwind was on “autopilot.”', '“It’s not a gigantic concession to say I’m flexible. This QT [quantitative tightening] was going to end at any rate at the end of the year,” said Pande, adding “we could misinterpret the minutes.”', 'Schumacher said the bond market will be looking for details on which securities the Fed might be rolling off of its balance sheet and which it will be replacing with new purchases, as their holdings mature.', '“We think potentially the biggest move in the bond market as far as the minutes go is the composition of the balance sheet. It’s not so much the equilibrium number, or when the Fed gets there...There’s been talk that the Fed should shorten the duration of its Treasurys.

Economists expect 182,000 nonfarm payrolls and the  unemployment rate to hold steady at 5.1 percent, according to  Thomson Reuters. Just 142,000 jobs were added in September.', '  “As long as we get the next couple of jobs numbers, over 150,000,  that will be enough to get them to move in December. That was a  pretty clear message in the statement,” said Zandi.

The whole  mantra about being data dependent and needing to have a degree of  uncertainty about liftoff is understandable, but in our view it  caps the upside over the next month or so. What’s likely is  looking toward the end of the year, after what we think is a  pause, you’re going to get more upside as uncertainty  dissipates.”', '  Emanuel said he thinks stocks could trade sideways until the  Fed’s decision is clear, and his target for the S&P at  year end is 2,125, just about 50 points higher than Friday’s close.', '  “Part of the reason that October’s gains were as vigorous as they  were was that the market was relieved the Fed was taken off the  plate as an issue, and the Fed is now squarely back on the plate  and frankly as large as turkey and stuffing,” he said.

It was powered by a major invention: the steam engine. The steam engine enabled new manufacturing processes, leading to the creation of factories.', 'The Second Industrial Revolution came roughly one century later and was characterized by mass production in new industries like steel, oil and electricity.

This is also referred to as the “Digital Revolution.”', 'Krieger said the Fourth Industrial Revolution is different from the third for two reasons: the gap between the digital, physical and biological worlds is shrinking, and technology is changing faster than ever.', 'For evidence of how quickly technological change is spreading, Krieger pointed to the adoption of the telephone. It took 75 years for 100 million people to get access to the telephone; the gaming app “Pokemon Go” hooked that many users in less than one month in 2016.', 'Companies in industries from retail to transportation to banking are vying to incorporate new technologies like augmented reality, 3D printing and artificial intelligence into their operations.

But its feedback is expected to figure prominently in the USTR’s approach, since formal meetings with the relevant advisory committees in the Senate and House have yet to take place, according to congressional aides.', 'Deep policy divisions appear to exist between the business and labor groups: The report cites the “majority” of members preferring to focus on issues outside trade deficits in favor of a “mutually beneficial” trade deal, sentiments to which the labor union representatives dissent in favor of promoting U.S. investment and jobs.', 'An addendum to the report authored by labor representatives references a “nationwide debate” about the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was ultimately rejected by candidates from both parties. “As a result, the TPP must not be a template for renegotiating NAFTA, as some suggest.”', 'Democratic lawmakers backed by labor and environmental groups rejected the TPP-type approach ahead of the release of the negotiating objectives on Monday.', '“People are very concerned about what the direction of NAFTA is,” said Rep.

Republican front-runner Donald Trump, for instance, has  called the trade pact “an attack on America’s business,” but  experts say many businesses will likely benefit from the  deal.', '  “For some sectors it’s a good agreement, for others I have  concerns,” said Tim Brightbill, a partner at Wiley Rein  specializing in international trade law and policy.', 'Brightbill, who also serves as vice chair of the U.S. government-administrated Industry  Trade Advisory Committee on Services and Finance Industries,  pointed to the tech and telecommunications sectors as likely  beneficiaries of the deal.', 'The “electronic  commerce” section of the TPP text, in particular, lays  out explicit agreements that will remove barriers to entry for  Silicon Valley companies and others. These include clauses on  reasonably comprehensive consumer and personal identification  protection, and an agreement that a country cannot force  companies to use computing facilities within its borders.', '  For many tech firms, the most attractive piece of the deal may be  that it says that “No Party shall require the transfer of, or  access to, source code of software owned by a person of another  Party, as a condition for the import, distribution, sale or use  of such software, or of products containing such software, in its  territory.” ', '  In other words, companies will never be forced to hand over their  code — a topic currently sparking fears in Silicon Valley as  China (not a TPP member) seeks a peek at software’s code before it can be used in  key sectors. Any fears that TPP countries could enact similar  mandates would become moot if the deal were approved, likely  spurring increased entrance into those markets.', ' Read More China may  try to force US tech firms to give up code', '  Another apparent winner from the deal is U.S. agriculture. Derek  Scissors, a scholar for the American Enterprise Institute, wrote  in a Thursday analysis that  “American agriculture producers will be understandably happy” by  the increased access for their products abroad. This includes  soybeans and many other foodstuffs, but, Scissors noted, some  barriers still remain.', '  On the other side of the equation are U.S. manufacturers —  “I’m having a much harder time seeing how TPP helps them increase  exports or compete around the world,” Brightbill reflected.', '  One element of this is the lack of any real provision about  currency manipulation, experts and industry groups have said, as  the relative strength of the dollar accounts for much of U.S.  manufacturing’s woes. There remains considerable debate, however,  on whether manipulation is even a major problem with which  Washington should be grappling.', '  But another, less discussed, piece of the puzzle is the rules of  origin. These rules dictate what percentage of a good’s  components need to be manufactured in TPP member countries for those  products to qualify for duty-free status. As a 2013 Heritage Foundation  brief recognized, these rules “can make or break the  Trans-Pacific Partnership.”', '  American manufacturers (and certainly workers) generally want  higher percentage rules so that component competitors in nonpact  countries can’t benefit from decreased tariffs. On the other  hand, too stringent rules risk distributing the deal’s benefits  to few — or none — as nearly every company uses an  increasingly global supply chain.', '  While the North American Free Trade Agreement requires an auto to  include 62.5 percent of its content value in order to qualify for  the deal, TPP will only need 45 percent.', ' Read More Trans-Pacific Partnership: GOP candidates split on  deal', '  “If you’re a U.S. steel manufacturer, for example ... there’s a  scenario now where China can supply the steel or make more than  half the input, and if the rest is done in Malaysia or Vietnam,  it’s now a product of TPP and eligible for duty-free treatment,”  Brightbill said. “It’s hard for me to see how that will help U.S.  manufacturing in general.”', '  Another rules of origin problem for U.S. firms may be their  complexity, as the TPP “risks rendering firms uncertain how to  take advantage of treaty terms and confusing customs agents  charged with administering those terms,” according to Scissors.', '  Other parts of the TPP deal are less easy to grade before their  implementation. Experts have alternately praised and criticized  the rules governing state-owned enterprises. The  first-of-their-kind agreements make key headway in an important  issue facing American companies, but some, including Scissors,  worry that they don’t go far enough, and therefore establish a  loose precedent.', 'Read More  TPP: Why it’s too early to pop the champagne', '  All in all, Brightbill said many of his corporate clients are  concerned about how the TPP would shake out if approved.', '  “They are great companies that are world-class competitive, and  yet they struggle to export around the world because of trade  barriers in many other countries, including TPP countries,” he  said. “For them, if they can get their products into these  markets it would be a big win, but they are very concerned that  we are simply opening our market ... and we won’t see real  market opening from countries like Korea, Japan, Malaysia and  Vietnam.”', '  In fact, he said, while the U.S. remains a relatively easy market  to enter, some countries have barriers —regulatory and  otherwise — that trade agreements have difficulty  addressing.']"

Since then, engineers have developed innovative designs to avoid the kinds of failures that devastated Fukushima in Japan. The U.S. government was earmarking billions of dollars for a new atomic age, in part to help tame a warming global climate.', 'But a remarkable confluence of events is bringing that to an end, capped in recent days by Toshiba’s decision to take a $6 billion loss and pull Westinghouse, its American nuclear power subsidiary, out of the construction business.', 'The reasons are wide-ranging. Against expectations, demand for electricity has slowed. Natural-gas prices have tumbled, eroding nuclear power’s economic rationale. Alternative-energy sources like wind and solar power have come into their own.', 'And, perhaps most significantly, attempts to square two often-conflicting forces — the desire for greater safety, and the need to contain costs — while bringing to life complex new designs have blocked or delayed nearly all of the projects planned in the United States.', '“You can make it go fast, and you can make it be cheap — but not if you adhere to the standard of care that we do,” said Mark Cooper of the Institute for Energy and the Environment at Vermont Law School, referring to the U.S. regulatory body, which is considered one of the most meticulous in the world. “Nuclear safety always undermines nuclear economics. Inherently, it’s a technology whose time never comes.”', 'In the process, the U.S. could lose considerable influence over standards governing safety and waste management, nuclear experts say. And the world may show less willingness to move toward potentially safer designs.', 'More from The New York Times:', ' A Bee Mogul Confronts the Crisis in His Field', ' Greeks Turn to the Black Market as Another Bailout Showdown Looms', ' Once Again, the Estate Tax May Die', '“I’m concerned that if the U.S. is not seen as a big player, and doesn’t have that kind of market presence, that we won’t be in a competitive position to bring those standards back up,” said Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia. “If you’ve got more lax safety standards worldwide, I think that’s a problem from an industry perspective as well as just a human standard.”', 'This may be an advantage for state-owned nuclear industries worldwide. Often they benefit from long-term national policies in places like Eastern Europe, Asia and the Middle East.', 'By contrast, the Toshiba-Westinghouse withdrawal from nuclear construction shows how daunting it can be for the private sector to build these plants, even with generous government subsidies like loan guarantees and tax credits. Projects take decades to complete. Safety concerns change along the way, leading to new regulations, thousands of design alterations, delays and spiraling costs for every element.', 'In one case, even the dirt used to backfill excavated holes at the Westinghouse project in Georgia became a point of contention when it did not measure up to Nuclear Regulatory Commission standards, leading to increased costs and a lawsuit.', 'Thus far in the U.S., only the Tennessee Valley Authority, itself a government corporation, has been able to bring a new nuclear reactor into operation in the last 20 years.', 'Of the dozens of new reactors once up for licensing with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, only four are actively under construction. Two are at the Alvin W. Vogtle generating station in Georgia, and two at the Virgil C. Summer plant in South Carolina. Both projects, which plan to use a novel reactor from Westinghouse, have been plagued by delays and cost overruns, some stemming, paradoxically, from an untested regulatory system intended to simplify and accelerate their development.', 'The projects, more than three years late and billions over budget, are what pushed Westinghouse — one of the last private companies building nuclear reactors — and its parent, Toshiba, to the brink of financial ruin, resulting in Toshiba’s chairman stepping down.', 'The company has said that Westinghouse will complete the reactors for the projects it already has underway, including two in China. But the fate of other projects in the United States and abroad that plan to use the Westinghouse reactor, known as the AP1000, are in doubt, along with the role of the United States in the future of nuclear energy. It is also unclear how President Trump will approach nuclear energy development, which has broad and overlapping implications for tax and trade policies, economic development and national security.', 'The AP1000 is considered one of the world’s most advanced reactors, with simplified structures and safety equipment which were intended to make it easier and less expensive to install, operate and maintain. It has been designed with an improved ability to withstand earthquakes and plane crashes and is less vulnerable to a cutoff of electricity, which is what set off the triple meltdown at Fukushima.', 'The industry has lurched through boom and bust cycles before.', 'Nuclear construction had all but disappeared in the United States, particularly after the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979. Concerns over climate change led to renewed interest in building new plants under the administration of George W. Bush, however. The Bush-era energy policy acts authorized $18.5 billion in loan guarantees, plus tax credits like those available for wind and solar.', 'Determined to avoid the delays and ballooning costs that were common as plants were built in the 1970s and ’80s, federal regulators had devised a new licensing process.', 'Under the old system, companies received construction permits based on incomplete plans and then applied for an operating license, often leading to rebuilding and lengthy delays. The idea for the new system was that companies would submit much more complete design plans for approval, and then receive their operating licenses as construction started. That way, as long as they built exactly what they said they would, the process could move more quickly.', 'In the meantime, companies like Westinghouse and General Electric were developing a new generation of reactors intended to operate more safely. With the AP1000, for instance, emergency cooling for the reactor mainly relies on natural forces, like gravity, to propel the coolant, rather than relying on mechanical pumps powered by electricity. The problem is that electricity can fail, as it did at Fukushima, which can lead to disastrous overheating in a damaged reactor of an older design.', 'In addition, Westinghouse was engineering its equipment so that large components of the plants could be made in sections at factories, then welded together and lifted into place with cranes at the construction site. In theory, this approach would save money and time, requiring far less skilled labor than the old, bespoke approach, in which workers assembled more parts onsite.', 'By 2008, Westinghouse had deals to expand two existing plants with the electric utilities Georgia Power and South Carolina Electric & Gas. Little went as hoped.', 'Because nuclear construction had been dormant for so long, American companies lacked the equipment and expertise needed to make some of the biggest components, like the 300-ton reactor vessels. Instead, they were manufactured overseas, adding to expense and delays.', 'One reactor vessel, headed for Georgia Power’s Vogtle plant from the Port of Savannah, almost slipped off a specialized rail car. That led to a weeks-long delay before a second attempt was made to deliver it.', 'And, in a separate snafu, while working on the plant’s basement contractors installed 1,200 tons of steel reinforcing bar in a way that differed from the approved design. That triggered a seven-and-a-half month delay to get a license amendment.', 'To some extent, the unexpected delays were to be, well, expected, given the novelty of the design and the fact that builders were decades out of practice. Any large undertaking involving so many first-of-a-kind complexities would be likely get tripped up somewhere, said Daniel S. Lipman, vice president of supplier and international programs at the Nuclear Energy Institute, which represents the industry.', '“Whether you’re building a nuclear power plant or providing a new locomotive or a new fighter jet complex for the Defense Department, the first of a kind almost always takes longer to be deployed,” he said.', 'And then there was Fukushima, when an earthquake and tsunami knocked out both grid and backup emergency power at the plant, disabling its cooling systems and leading to the meltdown of three reactors. The plant remains shut down, and the decommissioning and cleanup process is projected to take as long as 40 years.', 'The Japan disaster prompted regulators to revisit safety standards, slowing approval of the Westinghouse designs and resulting in new requirements even after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave the go-ahead for the Georgia and South Carolina projects. That led to more costly delays as manufacturing orders had to be changed.', 'As all of that unfolded, Westinghouse was having troubles with the contractor it chose to complete the projects, a company that struggled to meet the strict demands of nuclear construction and was undergoing its own internal difficulties after a merger. As part of an effort to get the delays and escalating costs under control, Westinghouse acquired part of the construction company, which set off a series of still-unresolved disputes over who should absorb the cost overruns and how Westinghouse accounted for and reported values in the transaction.', 'Toshiba, which would like to sell all or part of its controlling interest in Westinghouse, has said it will continue to look into Westinghouse’s handling of the purchase.', '“Certainly they underestimated the amount of liability or cost overruns that these projects were in,” Robert Norfleet, a managing director at Alembic Global Advisors who has followed the machinations, said of Westinghouse. “I don’t really know how they can’t take the blame for that. That’s something within their own due diligence that they needed to do.”', 'In the meantime, the main stage for nuclear development will move overseas to places like China, Russia, India, Korea and a handful of countries in the Middle East, where Westinghouse will have to find partners to build its designs.', 'In China, plants using an earlier model of the AP1000 are moving toward completion. If they are successful, that may stir up more interest in the technology, and future installations may go more smoothly. But Toshiba’s ambitions of installing 45 new reactors worldwide by 2030 no longer look feasible.', 'Indeed, despite the much-ballyhooed ingenuity of a new generation of reactors designed by the likes of Westinghouse and G.E., countries may stick with older technologies that they can produce and install more quickly and cheaply. “Until several of these new designs — including the AP1000 from Westinghouse — come online on time and on budget,” said Brent Wanner, an analyst at the International Energy Agency, “it will be an uphill battle.”']"

But it was an easier decision for Beckett than other entrepreneurs.', '“We didn’t guarantee personal assets, because we had none,” Beckett said of starting out with several money-losing restaurants at age 26 in 2003 with his best friend, Huw Gott, before striking gold with the Hawksmoor concept. “In retrospect, that was a blessing. I would never now put my family’s security on the line to make more money. I used to draw no distinction between my finances and the company’s finances. Now I have a very clear line between the two.”', 'Beckett’s advice comes at a time when financing has tightened for entrepreneurs. Now to get a loan for an early stage or risky venture, banks often require applicants to make a personal guarantee, or a vow to repay funds with personal cash and/or assets in case of default. The arrangement can be tempting for everyone from restaurateurs to online entrepreneurs, but is risky for borrowers who may be required to put up their primary residences or life savings as collateral. Most entrepreneurs and experts agree that betting the house should be a last resort.', 'Here are a few ways to protect your personal assets when starting any business.', 'Shailesh Kumar, who now runs a financial advisory site, ValueStockGuide.com, was working with two banks in 2008 to recapitalize his steel-service center business when he was asked to put up his primary residence as collateral, despite having more than enough equipment and inventory to cover it.', 'Luckily, he’d already set up a holding company for all the steel service centers and other lines of business he owned as individual entities. This way, he owned equity directly in the top-level holding company but not the individual entities. The move cost him $500 using a company incorporation service and protected hundreds of thousands in personal assets when in 2009 he was forced to liquidate the steel business when the manufacturing sector took a tumble.', '“I satisfied the debt holders by turning over the collateral in the business that supported the debt, but we also owed money to many of our suppliers that we could not pay,” he said. “We had many tense meetings with the suppliers, with them trying to threaten action against my personal assets, but the two layers of corporate veil I had in place stood the test in courts. I was able to get debt written off, and there was no impact on the personal assets at all.”', 'More from iCONICThe crucial decision Elon Musk made when he was flat broke Why Disney’s Bob Iger pitched a $7 billion deal on his second day as CEO The female entrepreneur who said not to Wal-Mart’s lowball offer', 'The best way to save your personal assets is not to offer them up at all.', '“Find a lender who will accept an obligation limited to [a corporate] entity without a personal guarantee,” said Phil Crowley of New Jersey-based Law Office of Philip P. Crowley. “Creative solutions also involve using loans [including from friends and family] that are obligations only of the entity and are convertible into equity in the legal entity subject to certain conditions.”', 'To do this correctly, hire a lawyer with this specialized experience to set up the paperwork, Crowley said.', 'When signing documents on behalf of the business, be sure to put the entity’s name alongside it so it is clear you are acting as the entity and not as an individual, he said.', 'Banks aren’t the only ones that may request a personal guarantee. Commercial lessors often do, too, and they may have the ability to sue for the remaining term of the lease if things go south. Consider negotiating with the landlord to limit the term of your personal guarantee.', '“For example, on a five-year lease, ask for what’s called a burn-off, where your personal guarantee will expire, say, after 2.5 years,” said Kerry T. Boyle, a partner at the Ohio law firm Isaac Wiles.', 'Ask for the ability to terminate the lease if sales are lower than forecasted, Boyle said, otherwise known as a “gross sales kickout.”', 'Alternatively, if sales aren’t solid, you can ask the landlord to allow you to pay a percentage of gross sales instead of the stated rent amount, limiting your financial liability a little.', 'Ask yourself: Do you really need that bank loan or whatever it is you want to buy?', '“Many times, entrepreneurs will have preconceived notions about what is ‘required’ to be successful in a certain industry,” said John Weninger of the Wisconsin-based Vision Wealth Partners, which advises small businesses. “A lot of times those ideas are floated by people who stand to make a buck selling their product or service to gullible entrepreneurs who just don’t know.”', 'Consider all of the free, rentable or lower-cost tools that can be used to boost a new business before borrowing a large sum or hiring people, he said. Purchasing a business address is cheap and offers credibility while working out of a home office, while strategic partnerships can offer free yet valuable resources. “Consider approaching existing businesses who may be able to [share] space, resources … that is of little or no cost to you,” Weninger said. Hire interns through a college program instead of employees to keep labor expenses low, he added.', 'Hawksmoor is expanding to the United States with a restaurant in New York City’s World Trade Center set to open later this year. They financed the WTC restaurant with their current revenue and investor funding. The co-founders now have the luxury of being able to finance expansion based on the value in the business and its cash flow. But Beckett sees several restaurant entrepreneurs spending very large amounts of their personal wealth to keep up in the competitive dining environment, and it reminds him of when they started their first restaurant on a shoestring.', '“It’s a real source of concern for me,” Beckett said. “What is it you are signing away if this goes wrong?”']"

Investment from conglomerates will be crucial to establishing inter-Korea transport links and revitalizing an industrial park in the border region of Kaesong — two projects close to Moon’s heart. On a visit to Pyongyang last month, the president was accompanied by the heads of major chaebols who were present to assess potential business opportunities in the reclusive state.', 'With those corporate behemoths now at the center of Moon’s plans for inter-Korea partnerships, strategists say it’s unlikely the president will push them on reforms that many consider essential to the economy’s competitiveness.', '“President Moon is dependent on chaebols for economic cooperation between the two Koreas so given the circumstances, I don’t think it’s realistic to expect any fundamental reform of chaebols,” said Sangin Park, a chaebol expert at Seoul National University.', 'Even before the first inter-Korea summit in April, the administration did not lay out any concrete measures, added Park. “It is very disappointing.”', 'Chaebols also potentially have a significant role to play in rejuvenating the country’s tepid economic growth and lackluster job creation, with the unemployment rate hitting an eight-year high in August.', 'With North Korea and employment now the two most important policy areas for Seoul, “it is now very likely that President Moon has re-prioritized his policy agendas and sees chaebols, not as a subject of reform, but as an indispensable partner,” said Woochan Kim, a finance professor specializing in corproate reform at Korea University Business School.', 'A spokesperson for South Korea’s presidential office acknowledged that corporate participation was important to driving investments in North Korea but warned that “neither the extent of chaebol reform nor the priority placed on it will be diminished.”', 'The fact that Moon recently urged parliament to approve a law that enables chaebols to own internet bank shares up to 34 percent, well above the current ceiling of 4 percent, is also concerning, according to Kim. The law, which got passed last month, could result in more chaebol deregulation, potentially paving the way for conglomerates to own larger banks, Kim warned, adding that it went against Moon’s election campaign promise of separating banking and commerce.', 'In response, the presidential office spokesperson said internet banks would be prohibited from lending to large companies or transacting with their major shareholders.', 'Chaebols dominate the South Korean economy, with each boasting a range of diverse businesses. Hyundai, for example, is home to one of the world’s largest automakers, container shipping firms and steel producers in addition to manufacturing other goods such as solar panels.', 'But the conglomerates’ mode of operation requires a massive overhaul, according to critics. They argue that founding families wield too much power through practices such as cross-shareholding, which comes at the expense of other shareholders. Chaebols are also accused of using their monopolistic clout to squeeze out small and medium-sized enterprises, which create most of the country’s jobs. The inheritance of management rights by chaebol family members have also produced multiple fraud cases, analysts point out.', 'Corruption is also a major issue. From Samsung’s Lee Jae-yong to SK Group Chief Chey Tae-won, several chaebol heads have been sentenced to prison for graft-related cases.', 'Badly needed reforms include stricter antitrust laws, eliminating opaque circular shareholder structures and ensuring the voices of minority shareholders are heard, according to experts. U.S. activist hedge fund Elliott Management, which owns $1.5 billion worth of shares in Hyundai Group companies, recently demanded a restructuring of Hyundai Motor.', 'On the election trail, Moon promised to act on many of those issues. His commitment was reflected early in his presidency by appointing activist scholar Kim Sang-jo, known as the “chaebol sniper” in local media, to head the Fair Trade Commission, the country’s corporate watchdog.', 'The organization has since taken steps aimed at curbing unfair practices, including an investigation into illegal intra-trading deals. That’s helped push some chaebols such as Hyundai and Samsung to announce efforts aimed at streamlining ownership structures.', 'The government is also pushing for revised laws that would improve governance and implement regulations on chaebol holding companies, according to the presidential office spokesperson. The goal is for those revisions to get passed in parliament this year, the spokesperson added.', 'But so far, experts say the state’s efforts have yet to produce any game-changing results.', '“The control imposed by the Korean government on big conglomerates is still rather limited,” said Steve Chung, assistant lecturer at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “One of the major arguments as to why Moon failed to do much on chaebols is because they are important in bringing financial incentives to North Korea,” Chung continued, adding that chaebol engagement in North Korea could build confidence for international players to follow suit.', 'For now, it’s still too early for South Korean entities to do business in the North, which is expected to remain under international sanctions until it makes real progress on denuclearization.', 'The visit of chaebol chiefs to Pyongyang last month was more a show of goodwill than a sign of serious investment consideration, according to Cheon Seong-whun, visiting research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, a Seoul-based think tank.', '“Kim Jong Un is very interested in developing tourism on the eastern coast and has previously said he wants to establish an industrial compound focusing on labor-intensive industries,” said Cheon, who served as South Korea’s presidential secretary for security strategy from 2014 to 2017.']"

48,The presidential election has finally become the big threat for markets,2016-10-28T22:58:59+0000,"['  The presidential election’s final days could present new  headwinds for markets and overshadow what are typically major  events — a Fed meeting and the monthly employment report.', '  The Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday is expected to signal  that it is close to raising rates if the economy and financial  conditions are right. It could even adjust the language in its  statement to point more clearly at its next meeting, in December,  as the time when it would hope to raise interest rates.', '  The employment report Friday, always important, is expected to  show that 175,000 jobs were created in October, and that the  unemployment rate was a low 4.9 percent, according to Thomson  Reuters. There are also dozens of earnings, including Facebook, BP and Pfizer, and other important data, such as Tuesday’s auto sales and ISM manufacturing data.', '  But in the last week of campaigning before the Nov. 8   election, the market could also be vulnerable to headline  risk. Markets have been comfortable with the view  that Democrat Hillary Clinton looks set to win the White  House and that Republicans would likely hold onto the House of  Representatives. That would create a status quo situation where  there would continue to be gridlock. Wall Street has viewed GOP  nominee Donald Trump as too unpredictable, and he has been  trailing in the polls.', 'Friday’s revelation that the Federal Bureau of  Investigation is reviewing new evidence in connection with  its investigation of Clinton’s email server shook markets,  sending stocks lower. The emails were found during the FBI’s  investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, husband of a  senior Clinton aide. Weiner is under investigation for allegedly  sending sexually explicit messages to a minor. ', '  “The market has gotten pretty comfortable with the thought of a  December hike which de-emphasizes some of next week’s Fed meeting  and jobs report, but this election is now turning into a  situation with the potential for Brexit-like volatility,” said  Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. Brexit is used to describe  the U.K. vote last June to leave the European Union, which led to  a temporary market sell-off.', '  Art Cashin, director of floor operations at UBS, said if Clinton  wins, the investigation will be hanging over her. “It  certainly means that probably before the inauguration if the  Republicans hold the House, there will be an investigation that  lasts four years,” said Cashin.', '  Redler, who follows short-term technicals, said there were  already some warning signs for stocks without the added election  uncertainty. “Breakouts are failing. Stocks are losing upward  momentum, and the indices make it seem as if everything is fine  and dandy. It’s a push, pull,” he said.', '  The  closed at 2,126 Friday, a decline of 0.7  percent for the week, but also below a key support level of 2,130.  The VIX, the market’s fear meter, jumped 5.4 percent to 16.19  Friday, and was up more than 20 percent for the week.    ', '  “I guess people are going to wait for the election or closer to  it. What if it’s Donald Trump and we get some type of Brexit  response and we get some kind of harsh down move? The catalyst of  Hillary running away with the election seems like it’s off the  table,” he said. “It could lead to a choppy headline-driven  market with more volatility in the next week or so.”', '  Redler said he expects traders to prepare to be in a ‘risk-off’  mode Monday, as they await more clarity on the investigation.', '  “The market under the surface looks worse than the Dow and  S&P,” he said. “You have the Russell making new weekly lows.  You have oil down almost 3 percent on the week. You have key  stocks, Amazon and Apple, not performing well after earnings.”', '  The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 2.5 percent for the week and is  now down more than 5 percent for the month of October. ', '  Ari Wald, chief technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he’s  watching the Russell’s performance and other signs of  divergence. ', '  “You’re not seeing those warnings signs of a major top of the  market. There are some cracks here. We’ll see if it continues.  [Russell 2000 stocks have] had a near term breakdown but are  still above their rising 200-day moving average,” said Wald.  “Small-cap outperformance is related to broadening breadth. … I  don’t think it’s necessarily  a bearish omen for a  broad-based sell-off. It’s something to watch and it puts the  emphasis on large caps on the long side.”', '  Wald said the market will likely stay choppy. “It doesn’t look  like we’re ready to break out of it yet. In an election year,  when the incumbent is not up for election, it does put a  different spin on the usual seasonality trajectory. In an open  seat election, you do tend to have poorer performance in November  before gains in December,” he said. “It’s going to take one of  two things. One is we would have to see some sort of capitulation  either closer to the 200-day moving average around 2,080 or 2,100  or to see it on the upside. You’d have to break above resistance  at 2,160.” ', '  The bond market saw its own volatility in the past week, with  Treasury yields rapidly rising in a global sell-off. Yields  steadied Friday and moved to session lows on the Clinton  headlines. The 10-year  Treasury note was at 1.84 percent in late trading. ', '  Jeff Rosenberg, BlackRock Chief Fixed Income Strategist,  said the rising yields have to do with increasing inflation  expectations as well as the fact that central bankers globally  are holding off on increasing stimulus. At the same time, the Fed  is planning to hike rates.  ', '  “Basically, we’ve unwound the entirety of the move in interest  rates post-Brexit. That makes sense given the resilience in the  global economy,” said Rosenberg. “Do we see scope for a modest  increase in rates? Yes.” He said the 10-year could move to 2  percent or even 2.25 percent, or more if inflation picks  up. ', '  “All of that is contingent on no significant external shock,” he  said, noting the election could present a shock for the market.  “While it may go as expected and not be a major event, there’s  the possibility it could.”', '  The uncertainty could possibly prompt a flight to safety move,  and that would take yields lower. He said unexpected outcomes  would be if Clinton were to win and Democrats sweep  Congress. ', '  That is viewed as a negative by Wall Street since it would allow  Democrats to move quickly on spending, taxes and regulations that  might be viewed as market unfriendly. On the other hand, a win by  Trump is expected to create its own volatility, in part due to  his anti-trade comments.', '  Oil could also be a factor in the week ahead, since West Texas  Intermediate crude futures broke below the key $49  level. Oil was at $48.70 per barrel, down 2 percent  Friday and 4.2 percent for the week, its biggest weekly fall  since mid-September.', '  Members of OPEC are meeting over the weekend to discuss reducing  output.

He also liked Ulta Salon, because even with snazzy drones  — Amazon can’t do your hair. It will never have the beauty  parlors that Ulta has, thus Ulta cannot be Amazon-ed.', '  Third was TJX,  which has been a huge beneficiary of the excess inventory at  major department stores.

Trump appeals to a more conservative America, with hopes of making the country “great again” by reviving 20th-century manufacturing and energy industries, including steel and coal, and reversing decades of environmental legislation.', 'But however idealistically different, the two billionaires share a mastery of one thing: A mass psychology effect that has been studied for decades by researchers and is now being retested through the online laboratory of Twitter. It’s called tribalism.', 'While some would argue that the billionaires’ eruptions on Twitter are counterproductive — limiting their reach rather than finding the largest possible audience — psychology experts suggest the strategy works exactly as it should, and Twitter is merely the latest and largest study group for a phenomenon that has long been known to scientists.', 'Experts who study the psychological dynamics of “tribes” — groups that hold a family-like, emotional connection and ideology — say Musk and Trump have used similarly strong and extreme online rhetoric to galvanize massive and unwavering fleets of supporters.', '“It goes all the way back to pretty basic studies of group behavior, where people would join together with a mob of people and do things they wouldn’t normally do, that weren’t right, that were too extreme,” said social and personality psychologist Don Forsyth of the University of Richmond’s Jepson School of Leadership Studies. “Now that same process, that kind of mob behavior, is playing out on the internet.”', 'Studies have shown that human beings have an evolutionary drive to form distinct social groups as part of self-identification. Individuals discern themselves as members of many groups or tribes: their families, race, religion, political parties, gender, social organizations and residence. Not surprisingly, evidence also shows that individuals respond more positively to group members versus out-group members in order to strengthen their sense of belonging.', 'The politics, at least when it comes to Musk, remain somewhat murky. In a recent tweet, he described himself as “a utopian anarchist of the kind best described by Iain Banks,” a Scottish novelist who published science fiction.', 'Less than a week prior to the 2016 presidential election, Musk criticized Trump, saying “He doesn’t seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States.” But in the months following the president’s victory, Musk accepted an offer to join the Trump administration’s economic advisory council, drawing large criticism. Musk defended his decision, saying that his access to the commander-in-chief could help change Trump’s mind on issues where they disagreed. But the tech mogul’s gig at the White House lasted till June 2017, following the president’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement. “Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,” Musk tweeted.', 'More recently, Musk was criticized for donating $38,900 last month to Protect the House, a committee with the goal of preserving a Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Musk didn’t flat deny the donations, but took to Twitter to recuse himself of being a “top donor” to the GOP. He stressed his environmental and human rights positions and that he has donated to both parties as an “independent” who wants to maintain an “open dialogue.”', 'For psychologists, Musk’s political beliefs matter less than the medium and the mass mobilization, and experts say Musk’s extreme rhetoric is working to galvanize his following, mirroring Trump. Psychologists believe social media has intensified this phenomenon by connecting individuals on a previously impossible scale of millions.', '“At the click of their cellphone, people can signal their identity to hundreds or thousands of people by rewarding in-group members or punishing out-group members,” said associate professor of psychology and neuroscience Jay Van Bavel of New York University, in an email. “Social media just puts our tribal psychology on steroids.”', 'Last week Musk made headlines when he lashed out at British cave diver Vernon Unsworth, calling him “pedo guy” on Twitter. Unsworth was one of the foreign rescuers who played a critical role in saving the 12 boys trapped in an underwater cave in Thailand. Musk had offered support for the rescue mission, sending a kid-size submarine, which Unsworth said in a CNN interview “has absolutely no chance of working,” sparking Musk’s Twitter outburst.', 'One key group that Musk needs to retain was not at all happy: institutional investors who hold a majority of Tesla shares. The now-deleted tweets spooked investors, sending Tesla shares tumbling, and investors issued public comments upbraiding Musk and pleading with him to use social media less, as has been the case with White House advisors counseling Trump, according to many press reports. But in order to feed and grow an immense cultlike following, that advice may be as difficult for Musk to adhere to as it is for the president.', '“The success of Tesla is influenced substantially by people’s faith in Musk. And in this day and age — and with our own president leading the way — Twitter is the way to create that public presence.” Forsyth said. “Important people use Twitter and they have many, many followers.”', 'Even as Musk took a heap of backlash from investors, his Twitter followers mobilized to his defense, quick to find humility in Musk’s behavior, saying that it’s “human nature” to “hit back,” while also suggesting that Musk’s language was wrong. Musk supporters even used a common defense among Trump supporters, arguing that he didn’t really mean what he said “literally.”', 'Prominent Silicon Valley billionaire investor Peter Thiel, who along with Musk is a member of the original “PayPal mafia,” defended his high-profile support of Trump right before the election by saying that the media’s mistake was to take Trump literally rather than seriously.', '“No matter what Trump says or Musk says, if they have built a real tribe, it doesn’t matter. To maintain the adherence of their supporter to some degree it’s less about content and more about emotional connection,” said Daniel Shapiro of Harvard Medical School. “The tribe gives us a sense of safety. It gives us a sense of security. We know that our identity is being protected through that tribe,” Shapiro said.', 'Van Bavel echoed Shapiro’s sentiment, saying that tribalism can lead to the vehement support of leaders like Trump or Musk, even when there is clear evidence that they exercise poor judgment. “Once people identify strongly with a leader or party, they are motivated to distort their beliefs to support them,” prompting individuals to look past Musk or Trump’s atypical behavior.', 'The results of a recent Politico/Morning Consult poll found that a majority of Americans, 62 percent, disapprove of the president’s Twitter use, but there is a large discrepancy between Republicans and Democrats. Only 38 percent of Republicans say the president’s Twitter use is “a bad thing,” versus 84 percent of Democrats. Experts also warn that combative criticism of leaders like Musk or Trump only fuels their base of supporters. They explain that tribes create a mentality of “an attack on one, attack on all.”', 'With a growing emphasis on social media across politics and business, academics expect this mentality to intensify in the future.', '“The internet, the evolution of technology, is leading us into unresearched areas for psychologists and social psychologists, but it’s not going away. If we really want to generalize, will it create more tendencies for people to polarize? Will people become more committed to their groups and cause more antagonism between groups?” Forsyth asked. “I would be afraid that’s likely.”']"

The Trump administration was also making progress with Mexico toward a revision of the NAFTA trade agreement.', 'But trade will be a focus Wednesday when $16 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods are expected to be implemented, and China is expected to put tariffs on U.S. goods in return. Administration officials have said talks with China have basically stalled, which is another reason analysts expect progress with Europe and on revising the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada.', '“I think the market is basically putting it on the back burner now, until new information comes in. I think the fact the president did come up with that truce with the EU was helpful, and then he made a comment that Mexico is next.

If the BOJ does this, it’s bad for risk generally, including stocks,” he said. Ferridge noted that the European Central Bank is winding down its asset purchases, moving away from the easy stance it adopted during the European debt crisis.', 'Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR, said if the 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, does hit 3 percent, it should not be a problem for stocks unless it continues to shoot higher.

The spread between the two yields, at 27 Friday, has been closely watched by the markets, since a flattening curve can be a warning about the economy, and one that actually inverts is viewed as a recession warning.', '“In an ultimate move in the 10-year yield back over 3 percent, equities don’t get sold on that unless the 2-year moves up higher and faster,” said Hogan. “If we get a new high on the yield, that’s also a new flavor.”', '“The last time it happened, the market freaked out.

The company’s release said 19 percent of its sales were to Europe in the first fiscal quarter of 2018.', '“Harley-Davidson believes the tremendous cost increase, if passed onto its dealers and retail customers, would have an immediate and lasting detrimental impact to its business in the region,” the company said at the time.', 'Mnuchin said that he has “not spoken to the Harley-Davidson people direct” but noted that the President has. Trump initially said in a tweet that he was “surprised,” before later going on the offensive, blasting Harley-Davidson and saying that his administration is now “working with other” motorcycle companies.', 'Pressed by Congressional representatives about the broader scope of Trump’s escalating trade war with China, Europe, Canada and Mexico, Mnuchin said he could “assure” them that he is “monitoring” the situation.', '“We have not yet seen any negative impact,” Mnuchin said. “We are monitoring the impact on the economy of all these different issues.”', 'Mnuchin also addressed the possibility of a global economic recession and the rise in yields, as the so-called yield curve between two-year Treasury note yields and 10-year note yields moves closer and closer to zero.', '“We don’t have an inverted yield curve. There’s a flattening of the yield curve that somewhat reflects people’s future view of rates and where rates will be. I don’t think that’s indicative in any way of recession concerns,” Mnuchin.', 'The declining yield curve means there is less payoff for investors willing to hold debt for a longer period of time. At the latest reading, the spread between the yield on the 10-year note and the two-year note was 26.19 basis points, down from above 90 basis points early in the year.']"

That would  still mark a tick down from last year’s 5.4 percent growth.   ', '  The IMF is forecasting India will remain the world’s  fastest-growing large economy, set to grow 7.5 percent this year  and next as it benefits from lower oil prices. Last year, India’s  economy grew 7.3 percent.

', '  The IMF noted the region’s downside risks loom large, ranging  from slowing growth in developed markets and weak global trade,  to low commodity prices and high domestic debt in certain  countries. ', 'At a press conference on Tuesday, Rhee noted that in the wake of the global financial crisis, Asia relied heavily on fiscal policy and now leverage levels in the region were much more severe than in other regions, especially levels of corporate and household debt. ', 'At the same time, he noted that the region’s corporate profitability levels were relatively low, marking a potential vulnerability if not addressed urgently. ', '  But in the report, the IMF noted that outcomes could be more positive than its  forecasts. ', '  “Low commodity prices could be a bigger boost to the region’s  economies than expected; and regional and multilateral trade  agreements, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, could benefit  Asia-Pacific even before they are ratified,” the IMF said. ', '  But the outlook for individual countries varied widely. ', '  China, which is rebalancing its economy away from a dependence on  manufacturing and toward consumption, is expected to see its  economic growth slow to 6.5 percent this year and 6.2 percent in  2017, from 6.9 percent last year, the report said. ', '  “While this transition to slower but more sustainable growth is  desirable for both China and the global economy, it is causing  changes in the manufacturing sector over the medium-term, as  heavy industries, such as steel and shipbuilding, face major  consolidation to reduce excess capacity,” the IMF said. ', '  But it also noted that not all of the regional spillovers from  China’s economy are negative. While there are larger costs  short-term from exposure to China’s slowdown, Asia also reaps  medium-term benefits from that greater exposure, the IMF report  said. ', '  “While ongoing rebalancing in China will weigh more heavily on  Asian countries with higher exposure to China’s domestic  investment, exposure to China’s consumption will provide a buffer  and may boost exports of some countries,” it said, citing in  particular Chinese consumers’ interest in higher-quality,  high-protein foodstuffs. An increase in outbound Chinese tourists  will also benefit countries that attract them, the IMF said.', 'In the press conference on Tuesday, Rhee said countries such as New Zealand and India, which sell consumption goods, would will likely benefit, while countries such as South Korea or Taiwan that sell intermediate or investment materials, which may need assembly within China, will likely face headwinds.

62,A push to create the next great American marijuana town,2016-04-14T17:41:58+0000,"['  If California is  the land of reinvention, the small desert city of Adelanto fits  the bill.', '  Roughly a two-hour drive east from Los Angeles, Adelanto was  founded in 1915 by an inventor who wanted to sell land to World  War I veterans. His dream never materialized and the region was  taken over by orchard farms, then poultry ranches. The nearby  George Air Force Base opened and eventually closed in the early  1990s. The city more recently made a solar play, but the  energy market fizzled. City unemployment hovers at 14 percent,  well above the national unemployment rate of under 5 percent. And  the big employers in town include prisons and the local school  district.', '  Then a year ago, community leaders and yet-to-be elected Adelanto City Council  member John “Bug” Woodard started to mull the idea of  transforming the city into a high-tech mecca for marijuana  cultivation. The high desert community already had massive industrial  buildings that could house state-of-the-art growing spaces for  commercial-scale cannabis farming. Why not attract marijuana  businesses and investors, and add needed revenue to the city’s  general fund? ', '  In November last  year after months of debate, Adelanto became among the  first California cities to permit commercial cultivation of  medical marijuana. Other desert cities in southern California are  pursuing similar strategies, including Desert Hot Springs. It’s  not that the arid region lends itself to outdoor cannabis  farming. The area just happens to have many large, indoor  industrial spaces that are ideal for controlled medical marijuana  cultivation. And Adelanto needed a new revenue stream.', 'Soon the flashy cars began peeling off Highway 395 into Adelanto.  Population: roughly 32,000 residents. ', '  “Our little town, a lot of people just drive by, going down 395,  going up to Mammoth or heading up to Nevada, Reno,” said city  council member Woodard. “They wouldn’t stop here.”', '  But things have changed. “Every day I have to pinch myself because  we’re seeing Bentleys, Rolls-Royces coming to town,” Woodard  said. “These cars weren’t coming here a year ago. They wouldn’t  even think about coming down this old crappy road over here,”  said Woodard, who moved to the city in  1998. ', '  At the time, the local air force base had closed. Unemployed  families packed up. Property was cheap. Adelanto is also about 40  miles south of Barstow. This area is the high desert. Think  sparse Joshua trees. Motorcycles zooming down two-lane highways. ', '  Decades later, modern Adelanto is reaching for its next act in  marijuana production, entirely in indoor spaces. And there’s potentially millions, if not  billions, at stake for the entire state.', '  If California voters in November approve adult cannabis use through statewide ballot measures, analysts forecast California’s total marijuana market  for both medical and adult use could reach $4 billion  by 2018 — more than double the size of the expected  $2.5 billion Colorado market, according to ArcView Market  Research and New Frontier. Both are cannabis research  companies.', 'The business impact of an approval would be “tremendous,” Woodard said. “A lot of these folks, they’ve spent literally millions of dollars to move here, to set up business here.”', 'Last year alone, medical marijuana sales in California reached  $2.7 billion, nearly half the total $5.7 billion in sales for the  entire country, according to the two research firms. (The 2015  annual figure was updated.) ', '  The potential for legalized, large-scale marijuana farming has  already boosted local property values.', '  “The price of real estate shot up so fast,” Woodard said.', '  Some local businesses not even in the cannabis market have  realized their property is worth more than $1 million. The  thinking is, ”‘Wait a minute. My property is worth a million and  a half? What if I spent $250, $300 grand and move my business on  the other side of town, I put a million in my pocket,’ ” Woodard  said. “What we’ve seen is a lot of people becoming instant  millionaires.” ', '  This, in a community where the median household income is around  $39,200.  ', '  Then the celebrity connections emerged.', '  Bob Marley’s son, Ky-Mani Marley, has signed on to license a  strain of cannabis that will be grown in Adelanto, said Freddy  Sayegh, an attorney on the project.', '  Sayegh has advocated for defendants charged  with marijuana violations, including dispensaries, co-ops,  cultivators and patients.', ' Tweet 1', '  Comedian Tommy Chong of Cheech and Chong  fame — a longtime advocate for cannabis  decriminalization — hopes to mass produce his brand of  legal marijuana, “Chong’s Choice,” in Adelanto.', 'The city’s warehouses for cannabis cultivation and research will mingle with other  industries. Other regional employers include General Atomics, which manufactures unmanned aerial  vehicles or drones in addition to other technology. Northwest Pipe Company makes large diameter,  high-pressure steel pipes used primarily for water transmission.', '  There was a yacht maker at one point. But the production  of CABO Yachts was  shuttered in 2010.', '  Some community leaders including Adelanto Mayor Richard Kerr want growers to plant their roots here. The end game is tax revenues,  local job creation and an entire cannabis ecosystem centered on large-scale marijuana farming.', '“We have jobs coming to town,” said Woodard. “From logistics to  shipping receiving, to producing products, manufacturing  products. You got to have people fixing machines when they break  down. You’ll probably be hiring a trucking company.” Details are being ironed out.', '  “A lot of this is brand new,” said Woodard, who also  organizes a local music festival.', '  Yet not every resident is thrilled with the idea of  Adelanto’s push into the pot business. ', '  The cannabis ordinance to permit commercial cultivation wasn’t a  slam dunk among some local school and law enforcement officials.  No one in town wanted to create a business magnet for trouble.  “We got bombarded by a lot of people that were against it,”  Woodard said.', '  All cannabis permitting includes a vetting process and background  check. So far, under 30 companies have secured licenses to grow  marijuana in Adelanto. ', '  “The majority of applicants have been scientists, doctors,  attorneys and other reputable professionals with extensive  backgrounds as respectful leaders, teachers and honorable members  of the community,” the city said in a prepared statement on the  vote to allow cultivation of medical marijuana.', '  Cannabis farming will be limited to an industrial park far from  frequently visited residential and commercial areas. The ordinance does not allow for any retail sales, or point of contact with retail customers. ', '“The City Council thoroughly weighed the pros and cons of  allowing marijuana cultivation, and only after careful and  deliberate consideration, discussions and debate — chose to  move forward believing that the positives outweighed the  negatives, and, that steps would be taken to mitigate any  potential negative consequences,” according to the  statement.', '  And don’t expect every city in California to start chasing  marijuana cultivation as a solution to budget shortfalls.', '  Adelanto was facing bankruptcy and needed revenue to run the  local schools, police department and other community services.  The city’s annual general fund is roughly $12 million, and  full-scale marijuana cultivation could bring in anywhere from $6  million to $10 million in yearly revenue, said attorney  Sayegh. ', '  For larger cities, a $6 million annual revenue gain is a drop in  the bucket. But for Adelanto, cannabis cultivation offered a  shot at a future. “It saves the city,” Sayegh says.', '  Looking ahead, mayor Kerr and other cannabis business leaders  have said Adelanto could produce more than 100 tons of marijuana  annually. But that may just be the tip of the cannabis iceberg.  “I don’t think that’s a lofty goal,” Woodard said. “The more the  better.”', '  Across the U.S., legal marijuana market sales could surpass $22  billion, with adult use sales comprising about 53 percent of the  total legal market, according ArcView and New  Frontier. ', '  Said John Kagia, director of industry analytics for New Frontier,  “It’s very difficult for people who live outside the state to  truly understand the scale of what’s happening.”', '  And Adelanto is poised to be central to that state boom. Seems  fitting as “adelanto” means “advancement” or “progress” in  Spanish.']"

Joe Donnelly, who faces Republican businessman Mike Braun in what is expected to be one of the nation’s most competitive Senate races.', 'Trump branded Donnelly as “Sleepin’ Joe.” He assailed him for opposing the president’s signature tax cuts and his attempt to end the Affordable Care Act. And he criticized Donnelly for supporting the Iran nuclear deal forged by President Barack Obama and withdrawn from by Trump this week.', 'Trump said Donnelly would “do whatever Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi tell him to do” and claimed the senator would “say one thing in Elkhart,” and then support the “radical, liberal agenda.”', 'After the rally, Donnelly said in a statement it was “okay” that Trump and Pence were “here today for politics, but problems only get solved when you roll up your sleeves and put in the hard work.”', '“I’m Indiana’s hired help in the Senate because I don’t work for any president or any political party -- I work for Hoosiers, and that will never change,” he said. Donnelly’s campaign said he had voted with Trump 62 percent of the time.', 'Basking in the cheers of thousands of supporters wearing his red campaign hats, Trump hailed his decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and his tough stance on trade deals, appealing to the region’s manufacturing base. He reissued his campaign pledge to build a border wall with Mexico, telling the crowd the work had started despite opposition from Democrats.', 'And he celebrated the return of three Americans who had been held captive in North Korea, saying: “We welcomed them back home the proper way.”', 'But for a one time political novice who ran as an outsider, Trump played the role of party champion ahead of midterm elections that typically haunt the party that holds the White House. Trump is expected to ramp up his political travel in the coming months, and his advisers viewed the event as a way to project party unity following a rough primary that pitted Braun, a former state legislator, against two Republican congressmen.', 'Imploring Braun to join him on stage, Trump turned the podium over to the Senate nominee, who credited the president for providing an inspiration to his candidacy. “I’m a businessman and an outsider, just like our president,” Braun said to cheers.', 'The president, who helped raise $132 million for the Republican National Committee in 2016, won 10 states where Democratic senators are on the ballot this year. He’s expected to campaign heavily to help Republicans maintain Senate and House majorities and elect GOP governors. In his remarks, Trump painted a glowing picture of his presidency.', '“We are all making America proud. We are rockin,”′ he said. “The great news keeps rolling in.” Missing was any reference to the clouds cast by the special counsel’s ongoing investigation into Russian election meddling and near-daily revelations about Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen’s payments to a porn actress who alleges an affair with Trump.', 'Cohen appears to have used his relationship with Trump to earn hundreds of thousands of dollars — a practice at odds with Trump’s “Drain the swamp” campaign message.', 'But Trump instead lobbed the “swamp person” charge at Donnelly, prompting the audience to break into a “Drain the swamp” chant.', 'The Indiana rally was Trump’s fourth political-style event in the past two weeks. Trump skipped the White House Correspondents’ Dinner late last month to rally supporters in Macomb County, Michigan.', 'He spoke last week to the National Rifle Association in Dallas. And last Saturday, Trump was in Ohio, long the key electoral piece for any GOP presidential hopeful.', 'As he travels the country, Trump will face the question of whether his appeal is transferable to down-ballot candidates, much in the way that Obama struggled to rally core Democrats when he wasn’t running himself.', 'Obama suffered broad losses in Congress and in statehouses during the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections, an outcome Trump hopes to avoid.']"
64,Trump trade plans could cause global recession: Experts,2016-03-10T18:14:30+0000,"['  When Mitt Romney  unleashed a barrage of criticism against his party’s  front-runner, he began with the economic argument against Donald  Trump. He’s not alone in these claims: Many economists are also  expressing their concern that the real estate magnate’s policies  could lead to a global recession.', '  Romney charged that Trump “would be very  bad for American workers and for American families.” But Trump’s  tax plan bears many similarities with other GOP hopefuls in that  it would reduce the marginal rates for many individuals and  businesses. Instead, it’s his propositions for  America’s place in the global economy that are raising eyebrows.', '  “We have so much power and we don’t use it,” Trump told CNBC’s  “Squawk Box” in an interview Thursday. “We can’t let the world  take advantage of us from an economic standpoint, and that’s what  they’re doing.”', '  Trump argued that other countries are unfairly taking advantage  of the U.S. through a combination of high taxes on American  products and devaluing their own currencies. While using the  American economy as “the money supply,” these countries are  bleeding high-paying jobs — and whole companies — out  of the U.S., Trump contended.', '  The solution, Trump has said, is to levy high tariffs on the  goods of any country he feels treats America unfairly.', '  “There’s only one thing you can really do — I mean you can  devalue, but you can do something else which I think is probably  much better than devaluing — you can charge surtax or you  can charge a tax for products that they sell in the United  States,” Trump said. “I have great relationships and business  relationships with China, and even those people say they can’t  believe what they’re getting away with.”', '  But many experts interviewed by CNBC dismissed Trump’s calls for  extreme tariffs — 35 percent on Ford vehicles from  Mexico and 45 percent on Chinese  goods — saying they strained credulity, even by  campaign-promise standards.', '  “I think in order to qualify as a coherent set of policies, the  policies have to not be cartoonish and the policies have to stand  some chance of being actually enacted, and I just don’t think Mr.  Trump’s trade policies meet either of those criteria,” said  Michael Strain, resident scholar at the conservative American  Enterprise Institute.', '  A spokeswoman for Trump’s campaign did not immediately return a  request for comment on this article.', 'Congress would never assent to such extreme measures, Strain  said, because international trading partners and domestic  businesses would immediately apply “enormous pressure.” But  beyond the political possibility of such a proposal, massive  tariffs would also have significantly deleterious effects for the  U.S. and world economy, several economists said.', '  Even if the welfare of the rest of the globe is  excepted, such a tax on goods imported from China would  “tremendously” hurt the poor by jacking up the prices on many of  the products they most frequently use, said Caroline Freund, a  senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International  Economics.', '  But extreme tariffs would also hurt American manufacturing —  the very sector that Trump says he seeks to bolster — by  raising the prices on production inputs sourced from abroad.  Steel from China, for example, would become significantly more  expensive for more U.S. firms, Freund said.', '  “So many U.S. companies are deeply involved in global supply  chains: I can’t even imagine what that would look like with high  tariffs,” she said.', '  Expanding the economic view to the global level, experts said  Trump’s strong measures would likely start an international trade  war that cripples everyone involved. One argument economists make  is that high tariffs on goods from a country like China will lead  to an oversupply of products unable to be sold in the U.S., so  those goods will go for even cheaper than normal in other  countries, and those countries will then respond with tariffs of  their own. The end result is high prices around the world, and a  slowdown in international growth — or even an outright  recession.', '  Some countries might raise taxes on American goods  just as a reaction to a more isolationist economic policy, experts said.', '  “If you take (Trump’s) position as real, that we would do this,  then it would take the world down the road that we saw in the  1930s that we saw with the Smoot–Hawley Tariff,” Freund  said. “The world would definitely fall into a recession.”', '  That 1930 act significantly raised tariffs on goods coming into  the United States, and “economists still agree that Smoot-Hawley  and the ensuing tariff wars were highly counterproductive and  contributed to the depth and length of the global  Depression,” then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said in 2013.', '  Although most economists present a united  front on the benefits of free trade, many argue against completely unfettered global capitalism. The usual  form of that criticism emanating from both sides of the debate is  that free trade deals between the U.S. and poorer countries hurt  the American middle class while contributing to worker  exploitation abroad.', 'Trump insisted on CNBC that he believes in free trade, but “to be a good free trader you have to have smart  people on our side also, and we are being out negotiated on every  corner.” And Trump isn’t the only candidate this year who has  expressed doubt about America’s global trade position.', '  “These treaties have forced American workers to compete against  desperate and low-wage labor around the world. The result has  been massive job losses in the United States and the shutting  down of tens of thousands of factories,” a statement on Democratic hopeful  Bernie Sanders’ Senate webpage said. “These corporately backed  trade agreements have significantly contributed to the race to  the bottom, the collapse of the American middle class and  increased wealth and income inequality.”', '  But many of those who say Trump has rightly diagnosed a problem are  wary of his prescriptions.', '  Thea Lee, deputy chief of staff at the AFL-CIO, told CNBC’s  “Power Lunch” last week that “there’s no question” recent trade  policies have failed American workers, but she said she worries  Trump doesn’t have “very many solutions about where we need to  go.”', '  “His proposals aren’t viable, they’re not practical, and they’re  hypocritical — to be honest,” she said, referring to his call  for Nabisco to bring Oreo production back from Mexico, while many  of his own clothing lines are produced offshore. “There’s no  question that we have a terrible disadvantage right now because  our trade policies have failed, but obviously he’s talking about  policies that would be outside of all our current trade  agreements and trade rules.”', '  For Peter Schiff, CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, Trump has  rightly identified the problematic imbalance of trade between the  U.S. and countries like China — but the real estate  magnate’s tariff proposals are just treating symptoms, not the  real problem of big government, over-regulation and the lack of  savings spurred by Fed policy.', '  Schiff said he agreed with others that Trump’s tariffs would hurt  many Americans in the short term, spiking prices, squeezing companies, increasing layoffs and deepening recession. But just  as critically, that near-term pain would not be sufficient to  renew America’s manufacturing base.', '  “Protectionism works when you have an industry to protect, but  when industry is gone, it’s just higher prices,” Schiff said,  explaining that there are few U.S. firms ready to supply  Americans with the goods they’ve come to expect from Chinese  sources.', '  Even CNBC contributor Larry Kudlow, who has endorsed Trump’s tax  plan, warned  last year that the candidate’s “protectionist” trade  proposals could backfire.', '  But some have cheered Trump’s proposals. In a note Thursday,  Peter Morici, an economist and business professor at the  University of Maryland, said the candidate’s tariff suggestion  “makes sense.”', '“Trump’s proposed tariff on imports to force China to revalue its  currency and renegotiate its trade practices is hardly  reckless,” he said, citing a similar prescription from liberal quarters.', '  It is absolutely possible that Trump’s trade positions are not  actually a set of goals, but are instead initial bids in a  protracted negotiation against those he considers to be abusing  the international system. In fact, Trump’s own website  says his plan to reform the  U.S.-China trade relationship is at its heart “a  negotiating strategy to bring fairness to our trade with China.”', '  But even if the calls for extreme tariffs are tactics to achieve  moderate protection, experts said they struggled to find sense in  Trump’s rhetoric.', '  “It’s not just different in degrees, it’s different in kind,” American Enterprise Institute’s Strain said. “He’s talking about the opening salvo of a trade  war, and the opening salvo of a trade war is just a different  thing than the modest protection of an industry.”', 'Peterson Institute’s Freund agreed, saying that “it’s not clear” why he would want to  start a negotiation from a position so far outside the  international norm.', '  Most advanced economies have tariff levels around the U.S.’s  simple average of 2.67 percent, and most developing countries  keep tariffs under 10 percent.']"

That’s because the  country’s $400 billion economy — the second largest in the  Middle East after Saudi Arabia — may surge in the months  ahead as President Hassan Rouhani works to diversify the  oil-based economy. ', 'So far, investor enthusiasm for the frontier market has not waned, despite ballistic missile tests conducted over the last two days by Iran’s  Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. The actions  defy U.S. sanctions and may be in violation of the UN resolution.', ' Iran’s GDP is  expected to grow 6 percent this year and almost 7 percent next  year, according to the World Bank. The country has  three great strengths: natural resources, including oil, gas and  minerals; a huge population of nearly 80 million; and  manufacturing capacity unrivaled in the Middle East. Oil and gas  account for only 10 percent of the GDP.', '  Investors worldwide have a myriad and growing number of options to  invest in Iran, probably the world’s hottest geographic  investment opportunity in the last 20 years — all except for  Americans.', '  Though they have been eyeing the Iranian market, U.S. institutional and individual  investors are hitting some brick walls because of the  still-in-place U.S. sanctions that make it nearly impossible  for U.S. companies to set up a physical presence in Iran, partner  with an Iranian company or even sell most goods  there. U.S. bilateral sanctions remain in place,  President Barack Obama has said, over Iran’s violations of human rights, support for terrorism and its ballistic missile program. Yesterday’s missile tests make an early removal of U.S. sanction less likely. Vice President Joe Biden condemned the action, and noted there could be U.S. retaliation.', '  There are a few exceptions, though, including food, medical  equipment, transportation and some IT products. And some U.S.  companies may be able to get licenses through the U.S. Treasury’s Office of  Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) to work in sectors defined as aligning  with U.S. policy interests, including oil and gas and aviation.  Companies, such as Honeywell International, General Electric and Boeing, are expected to get  to trade with Iran, said Cyrus  Razzaghi, CEO of Ara Enterprise, a consultancy in Tehran working  to help foreign companies and investors navigate Iranian laws  and find business partners. ', '“We get a lot of calls from American investors,” said  Dominic Bokor-Ingram, portfolio advisor to the Turquoise Variable  Capital Investment Fund, established in December with 50 million  euros to invest in public companies in Iran. His London-based  firm tells them: No, sorry, you can’t invest.', 'Meanwhile, European and Asian companies are  moving in to get early footholds. Airbus has a $27 billion deal to provide 118  jetliners to Iran’s state airline company; Peugeot returned  with a 400 million euro ($435 million) deal to update its factory  and begin manufacturing cars; the Renault-Nissan alliance is in  aggressive talks with local partners Saipa and Iran Khodro to expand car manufacturing; and Italian and French mining  companies, including Persiana Metalica and Fiault, are in talks to  invest more than 5 billion euros in aluminum and steel projects,  according to Iranian news sources, which also reported that  Chinese firms are negotiating to finance coal production. ', '  For now, individual U.S. investors and institutions are exploring  ways to invest in Iran through offshore entitles, foreign  subsidiaries or funds based in Europe, said sources. But “it’s  like speeding down the Dulles toll road at 90 mph,” said Farhad  Alavi, managing partner of the Akrivis law firm, naming a highway  near Washington, D.C. “You can do it 50 times and be fine, but  the 51st, you might not be.”', '  In other words, no one knows how the U.S. Department of Justice  will interpret the U.S. sanctions in the new environment,  especially against individual and institutional investors. In the  past, it has prosecuted many companies, large and small, for  breaking the embargo, including a 2014 $8.9 billion fine against  Paris-based financial services giant BNP Paribas. ', '  The risks for investors are undeniable. The biggest is the geopolitical risk and the  possibility of the U.S. reimposing sanctions if Iran violates the terms of the nuclear agreement down the road. In addition, the country has  infrastructure problems, an unfamiliar legal and regulatory regime that lacks transparency, complex regulations, and  all the usual challenges of finding good business partners.  Another wild card is how soon global banks will reengage in Iranian  business. Many are sitting on the sidelines to see how events unfold.', 'For those looking for a frontier investment play, here are four options open to investors worldwide.', '  • Private equity funds are opening, often  headquartered in London or Geneva, many with sector-specific  approaches. They offer assurances of compliance with the  still-evolving legal picture. For instance, Griffon Capital is a private equity firm focused on Iran, aiming to capture  institutional funds, according to its website. Its also has an  asset management arm to invest in Iranian securities,  headquartered in the Cayman Islands. Another fund is Iratel  Ventures. Mohsen Khalkhali, managing partner at the fund, which  is the investing arm of Iranian telecom company Pars Iratel, is  raising a $10 million to invest $50,000 to $100,000 in start-ups  in or related to Iran, especially in the mobile arena, he said.', '  • The Turquoise Variable Capital Investment  Fund, a joint venture between London-based Charlemagne  Capital and Tehran-based Turquoise Capital Partners, opened  in December with a minimum of 125,000 euros to invest. It’s  investing in 20 to 25 companies trading on the Tehran stock  exchange, which, according to Charlemagne, has a market  capitalization of $100 billion and daily trading volume of about  $2 billion, making it the second-largest exchange in the emerging  markets. Turquoise Capital also announced separately that it was  launching an ETF mirroring an index tracking Iran’s biggest  public companies.', '  • Investors with enough knowledge can also invest directly  in companies in Iran. The country’s laws allow foreign direct  investment, said Razzaghi. Foreigners are allowed to own 100  percent of a venture, and there are laws to protect them, he  said. And its tax rates are attractive.
