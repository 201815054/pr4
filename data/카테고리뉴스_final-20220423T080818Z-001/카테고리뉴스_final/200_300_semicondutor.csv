0,Here’s why the slump in semiconductor stocks may be a sign the US economy is slowing down,2018-10-26T13:06:43+0000,"['After a raft of mixed earnings reports by semiconductor companies and some gigantic stock declines, it’s fair to ask: How bad is it? And given the chip industry’s status as one of the anchors of business investment in the economy, is the string of weak news a sign the country as a whole is headed for slower growth?', 'That question has loomed large in the stock market’s gyrations this week. A market leader AMD stock dropped 21 percent on Wednesday night before a partial recovery Thursday, and Texas Instruments fell 8.8 percent after it reported that revenue was little changed in the third quarter as growth in its crucial auto segment slipped. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index of 30 top chip companies is down 17 percent since Labor Day, including the biggest one-day drop in a decade on Wednesday.', 'The picture isn’t unambiguous: An earnings beat from Intel late Thursday is helping to offset bad news from AMD and TI, and rival chipmaker Xilinx also beat expectations as growth in chips for 5G wireless and cloud-computing data centers offset a drop in demand for chips used in industrial and aerospace/military applications.', 'But slowing overall growth in chip sales and profits, albeit after a stellar 2017, has economists and market observers questioning whether technology investment is cresting — which, if true, would mean that the 2017 corporate tax cut is falling short of one of its most important goals.', '“IT equipment and software investment is 28 percent of total nonresidential fixed investment,” Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said. “Real investment spending is on track to grow 8 percent annualized in the third quarter. This is similar to the growth in 2017. So no, I don’t think the tax cuts have had any meaningful impact on IT investment.”', 'Another concern is the fallout effect on the sector amid the U.S.-China trade war and concerns around China’s economic growth. The White House implemented 10 percent taxes on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports in September. Those tariffs are set to rise to 25 percent by Jan.1 and could affect products manufactured with semiconductors.', 'For investors, one result of the chip slowdown has been falling prices for the nine major exchange-traded funds tied to semiconductor indices. The biggest, the $1.4 billion iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF, fell 6.6 percent on Wednesday alone, according to ETF Database. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF, with $870 million in assets, posted its biggest downturn for the group since November 2008 on Wednesday. It had outflows of almost 40 percent of its assets last week.', 'Each chip company is a little bit different, based on the end market it serves, CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said. Texas Instruments’ bobble has raised concerns in part because of slowing growth in its automotive markets, raising concern that if automakers are buying fewer sensors for Internet connectivity in machines, they may be anticipating a slowdown in their own sales.', '“They tend to be a good barometer for the economy because their chips go into almost everything,” said Zino. “Investors have to decide if it’s a hard landing or a soft landing.”', 'For now, Zino said, he’s betting that the chip industry and TI are in for more of a soft landing than a hard fall — but that could change.', 'The rub is that TI, in particular, attributed its revenue slowdown to customers building inventories more slowly, or even reducing them — distributors, rather than companies that put chips into products, are slowing orders the most. That means the slowdown may just reflect more caution in the supply chain, rather than any major problem in markets for cars and cellphones, Zino said.', 'On the other hand, the market is worried that the chip slowdown may be an early indicator of problems that Trump’s tariff increases this year are causing, and of issues that plans to impose 25 percent levies on $200 billion of Chinese exports to the United States in January might cause later, he said. But over time, even that would be overcome by secular trends like the rise of cloud computing and the Internet of things, he added.', 'AMD tanked because fourth-quarter guidance was 9 percent below consensus estimates and 18 percent lower than Goldman Sachs’ prior expectation, Goldman analyst Toshiya Hari said in a note to clients. On big problem is the waning of the cryptocurrency craze, which cut into one high-profile market for AMD products, and the company isn’t gaining market share in cloud-computing servers as fast as some investors expected.', 'But the problems are modest enough at AMD that Goldman left its $27 price target unchanged, Hari said.', 'AMD’s expected market-share gains in data centers may simply have turned up at Intel, though. The industry’s largest company said its data-center group boosted third-quarter revenue by 26 percent, the most of any Intel business segment. Overall, Intel earned $6.4 billion in the quarter on $19.1 billion in sales, both of which topped analysts’ estimates.', '“Our full-year [revenue] outlook is now up more than $6 billion from our January expectations,” Bob Swan, Intel CFO and Interim CEO, said in a statement.', 'But the problems in automotive and industrial chip markets has chipmakers’ earnings estimates falling for the first time in three years, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said.', '“Given the sharp declines in many stocks, we would not [initiate short positions that bet on shares to fall] right now, ” Moore said. “We remain cautious, owing to our view of weaker-than-expected growth in 2019 and the increasing likelihood for downward estimate revisions. The bigger reset [in stock prices] could potentially occur in the [first quarter of 2019] based on the timing of when the weakness in the supply chain and extent of customer-inventory reduction catches up with semi companies. ”', 'More from ETF Spotlight:Why cash could become the biggest market winner of 2018', 'How to make more money in stocks after market drops', 'The Saudi ‘oil weapon’ and the energy market: What investors need to know']"

The Semiconductor ETF (SMH) is just shy of the historic high it hit a year ago, and there’s good reason for it: China.', 'The five S&P companies with the biggest exposure to China are all semiconductors. Qualcomm, Micron, Qorvo, Broadcom, and Texas Instruments all get 40% to 60% of their revenues in China.', 'Semiconductors’ China exposure, (percent of revenue)', 'Source: Factset', 'As optimism for a U.S.-China trade deal rises, so have semiconductor prices. In fact semis are the leadership group among technology and cyclicals more broadly this year, with AMD up nearly 60%, and Nvidia, Lam Research, Micron, Applied Materials and Broadcom all up 20% to 40%.', 'Semiconductors year-to-date surge', 'Not surprisingly, there has been a close relationship between semis and the China stock market itself..the Semiconductor ETF is up about 28%, and the Shanghai stock exchange is also up about 28% — the two have been moving in lockstep all year.', 'Still the markets are pricing in a lot of optimism. Broadcom, for example, is a big Apple supplier. Softness in China, where Apple gets nearly 20% of its revenues, has been a concern.

The Germany chipmaker added that it intends to finance about 30% of total transaction value with equity and remainder with debt as well as cash on hand.', 'Infineon’s share price fell 6.5% Monday to the bottom of the Stoxx 600 as investors reacted to the deal. But Infineon Chief Financial Officer Sven Schneider told CNBC’s “Street Signs Europe” Monday that the cost and revenue synergies meant the “transaction makes a lot of sense.” ', 'Cypress shares soared 27% in pre-market trade, meanwhile.', 'Schneider also highlighted that Infineon paid 4.5 times revenue for Cypress, claiming this was “in line with recent revenue multiples” in comparable deals within the semiconductor industry.', 'Schneider said the combination of the two companies would “strengthen the link between the real and the digital world,” adding that the “new Infineon” would be the eighth-largest semiconductor company in the world and is targeting 10 billion euros a year in revenue.', '—Reuters contributed to this article.']"

Meanwhile, its shares reached a 52-week high during the session after beating earnings estimates by 13 cents in the last quarter.', '“The executives at Texas Instruments aren’t trying to help you time the semiconductor cycle,” the “Mad Money” host said. “They’re just trying to run the business, and that’s a very different thing.”', 'When an investor waits until he or she gets the green light to pull the trigger, the easy money will have already been made by the time it comes.', 'Instead, the wise move would be to do some homework and get ahead on the stock while the share price is less expensive.', 'But it won’t be necessary for the company to confirm that the slowdown has ended, Cramer said. On the Tuesday earnings call, Texas Instruments reported its second consecutive quarter of declining sales. The host said the chip cycle typically lasts as many as five quarters before turning around.', 'Tracking and trading Texas Instruments’ stock outside of that cycle helped Cramer pay his share of rent one summer in the 1980s as he studied for the New York bar exam.', 'Following Texas Instruments’ conference call, the stock rose $6 before giving up those gains and more after CFO Rafael Lizardi did not give that “all clear,” Cramer said. He said that was a moment to buy call options on Texas Instruments, and he still thinks the stock is a steal at its closing price above $118 per share.', '“If you wait for the cycle to actually turn, you will be way too late,” he said. “Yet, lots of people were desperate for verification from management so they dumped the stock when they didn’t get it. That’s a huge mistake.”', '“Oh, and talk about the need to be ahead: Lam Research told you last quarter a bottom could be in hand for semiconductor equipment. It crushed the numbers tonight,” he added.', 'Cramer said the same logic applied to Apple. The stock was sitting at about $140 in early January when the iPhone maker was laboring to transform itself into a subscription services business and its now-settled royalties dispute with Qualcomm was heating up.', 'Shares of Apple closed north of $207 on Wednesday after making steady gains throughout the year. A large chunk of the increase came before it reached an agreement with Qualcomm more than a week ago.', 'Cramer said investors had to be willing to take a chance and buy Apple before the deal was made in order to reap the profits, especially because Apple did not have a 5G plan without Qualcomm’s chips.', '“When the two companies reached a settlement last week, [Qualcomm stock] exploded higher — it’s still going higher — but Apple’s stock also rallied about 7 bucks,” he said. “Now, if you had waited until after the settlement, you missed some incredible moves. The big money was made before you got the all clear.”', 'The same principle applies to recent runs in Disney, Chipotle, and Home Depot, Cramer said.', 'Shares of Texas Instrument closed Wednesday at $118.43, up more than 25% from the start of the year.', '“The early bird gets the worm, people,” Cramer said. “And, in this case, the early bird is the one who knows you need to buy a stock before the underlying business turns around, while the other birds are still cowering in their nests waiting for the call that will always leave them late for dinner.”', 'Disclosure: Cramer’s charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Walt Disney, Home Depot, and Lam Research.']"
6,The next phase of semiconductor growth will not depend on smartphone sales: Tokyo Electron CEO,2018-09-14T01:28:23+0000,"['The so-called Internet of Things (IoT) and big data will drive demand in the semiconductor space and the growth cycle will be very different from previous phases, according to the CEO of Tokyo Electron.', 'The Japanese company makes the equipment needed to produce semiconductors, and boasts a market cap of about $23.83 billion.', '“As we look to the future, we believe IoT will be at the core of everything. The big data that comes out of that would determine the semiconductor demand,” Toshiki Kawai told CNBC’s Akiko Fujita in a Japanese-language interview. He added that new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), augmented and virtual reality and the fifth-generation of mobile networks will also influence the demand for semiconductors.', '“IoT” basically describes millions of physical devices, such as smart televisions, home appliances and cars, that are connected to the internet and can be synced so that users are able to control everything at once.', '“It’s no longer like the past when the so-called silicon cycle began and ended with the number of smartphones sold. We’re looking at a different phase of growth,” Kawai said.', 'Global semiconductor revenue in 2017 came in at $420.4 billion, registering 21.6 percent growth from a year ago, according to research firm Gartner. That growth came mostly from the memory chip market, where insufficient supply drove prices higher.', 'But analysts and investors have predicted that the semiconductor sector is due for a significant decline because of falling memory chip prices, a build-up in inventory levels and a slowdown in demand from high-growth industries. The major drivers of demand for memory chips are smartphones, computers and data centers. Recently, one analyst noted that demand in each of those segments had worsened substantially and, as a result, led to a build up of inventories for suppliers.', 'There’s also some concern about the ongoing trade war between the United States and China. Kawai said that there hasn’t been any impact yet on Tokyo Electron as a result of the trade conflict, but the company will continue to monitor developments, especially those that could affect it in the short-term.', 'Another worry for major chip makers is that a number of technology companies are already working on making their own processors that can run artificial intelligence software. Those include the likes of Alphabet, Facebook, Apple and Alibaba.', 'For Tokyo Electron, which produces the equipment and technology those companies would need to build their own chips, the opportunity is attractive, according to Kawai.', '“We believe AI will grow on average 67 percent between 2017 and 2022,” he said, adding that artificial intelligence is “ripe with areas for innovation where our production equipment and semiconductor-producing technology will be utilized.”']"

Morgan Stanley analyst Shawn Kim noted, after conversations with semiconductor buyers and sellers, that the environment for the memory market has become increasingly negative.', 'Some experts predicted that trade tariffs could worsen the situation by taking up to 25 percent of semiconductor earnings.', 'Global semiconductor revenue in 2017 came in at $420.4 billion, registering a 21.6 percent growth from a year ago, according to research firm Gartner. That growth came mostly from the memory chip market where undersupply drove prices higher.', 'Gartner predicted in January that worldwide semiconductor revenue will return to single-figure growth in 2018 “before a correction in the memory market results in revenue declining slightly in 2019.”', 'Hou’s predictions for growth in the market were similar.', '“Starting from the fourth quarter this year to fourth quarter next year, ... some quarters, some months, we’re likely to see negative year-over-year growth of semiconductor,” he said. Hou said he expects close to zero percent growth in the sector for 2019.', 'Developments in new technologies — such as artificial intelligence, the fifth-generation of mobile networks and the so-called Internet of Things — could ultimately see demand in the semiconductor industry pick up again.', 'However, Hou urged caution over developments in those technologies.', '“A lot of them are still in the infant and early stage, so people have very high expectation(s),” he said. “I think that explains in the overbooking in the supply chain, that’s why there’s a lot of the inventory.” Once the cyclical downturn in the sector ends, the semiconductor industry might even grow at a faster pace due to demand from various new applications, Hou predicted.', 'But the outlook may not be very positive for many of the existing chip makers that dominate the market, including Samsung Electronics, Intel, SK Hynix and Micron Technology. That’s because many of the major technology and internet companies are making their own memory chips to put into products and data centers.', 'Those companies “want to optimize their performance to differentiate themselves, so they have incentive to do that,” Hou said, adding it’s a paradigm shift in the sector, where incumbents would see their market share shrink over the next five to 10 years.']"

The company’s 39-year-old founder reciprocates the appreciation and offers a handshake before heading into a meeting with suppliers.', 'The acknowledgement was one of many from employees that included fist-bumps, waves and other cordialities during a recent half-day visit to the plant with media and Scaringe, whose daily office is inside the former Mitsubishi Motors facility.', 'They’re pleasantries, but also signs of confidence in the CEO in the face of daunting challenges for the electric vehicle maker.', 'Wall Street has likewise applauded Scaringe, who founded the company in 2009 and brought it public through a blockbuster IPO in November. Most notably, Morgan Stanley lead auto analyst Adam Jonas dubbed Rivian as “the one” to be able to compete against EV industry leader Tesla.', 'But Rivian, like the rest of the automotive industry, is facing massive supply disruptions and has internally experienced expected, but still problematic, production snags that caused it to miss its production expectations last year.', 'The company’s stock price is off by more than 60% this year, as investors look for safer ground than an EV start-up amid recession fears.', 'Scaringe is aware of such problems but, like he has for more than a decade, remains focused on the mission at hand: to prove the company’s worth by actually producing vehicles, an ironic differentiator for the industry that separates Rivian from an influx of new EV start-ups in recent years. Rivian is currently producing the electric R1T pickups as well as Amazon delivery vans and some R1S SUVs.', 'Here’s what Scaringe had to say on the company’s production, parts shortages and more.', 'Scaringe said Rivian remains “really confident” it can produce 25,000 vehicles, including van and R1 models, in 2022. That estimate is down from initial expectations of about 50,000 vehicles, slashed by supplier disruptions.', 'Scarcity in semiconductor chips, a shortage the auto industry has been battling for more than a year now, and wire harnesses, which act as the nerves of a vehicle, poses the biggest hurdles for the company. Both are critical components in vehicles.', '“The vast majority of our vehicle is not having supply chain constraints. It’s just a small percentage,” Scaringe said. “It doesn’t take more than one part to stop the production.”', 'Scaringe doesn’t expect semiconductor supplies to normalize until next year. He, along with every other executive in the automotive industry, is regularly in contact with suppliers attempting to source, produce and ship as many parts as possible.', 'For Rivian, that includes having some of its employees on-site at the facilities of their suppliers in an attempt to assist production.', '“We don’t have a demand challenge at all. We have a ‘can we create enough vehicles’ challenge?” he told CNBC after a tour of the vehicle plant. “We have a supply chain problem. It’s frustrating, but we’re going to get through that.”', 'Rivian declined to disclose how many Amazon delivery vans the company has built, but dozens were waiting outside of the facility, ready to be delivered, and plenty more were being assembled inside.', 'The electric vans are expected to be a crucial part of Rivian’s growth. The first vans go to Amazon, Rivian’s largest shareholder with a 20% stake, followed eventually by deliveries to other companies.', 'Rivian says the vans can be produced faster than the consumer R1T and R1S vehicles because they have fewer features. They also go through fewer processes at the plant. For example, the painting of the vans – a tedious and long process – takes two hours less than paint jobs for the other vehicles.', 'Victor Taylor, senior director of stamping, body and plastic for the company, also noted there’s less complexity and time needed for the vans in the body shop.', 'Rivian, to the dismay of reservation holders, increased prices for its vehicles last month due to higher commodity costs. The company quickly rolled back the increases for its 70,000-some existing reservation holders but said it would hold to the updated pricing for new reservations made as of March 1.', 'The increases make the starting prices of the vehicles $67,500 for the R1T and $72,500 for the R1S. At those prices, both are considered luxury vehicles rather than mainstream models.', 'Scaringe said the company plans to produce lower-priced vehicles on its next-generation EV platform. Those vehicles will be manufactured at a planned $5 billion plant in Georgia, which is expected to come online in 2024.', 'Much like other automakers, Rivian also plans to maximize profits and increase performance of current models, according to Scaringe.', 'It’s the beginning of the end of fossil fuel-powered consumer vehicles — as far as Scaringe is concerned. The 39-year-old believes production and sales of such vehicles will come to an end in his lifetime, sooner rather than later.', 'Without putting an exact date on it, Scaringe said the end of that era is likely closer to 20 years from now rather than 50 years, with companies forced to move way from fossil fuels out of necessity as well as potential pressures from Wall Street and regulators.', '“Most countries around the world will stop selling gas engine-powered cars. The scale of the shift is hard to fully appreciate,” he said. “The challenge is whether it’s driven by policy or not. The businesses that are going to survive are the ones that recognize that the end state for combustion is zero.”', 'Rivian is among a flurry of EV start-ups to have gone public in recent years, but the company’s competitors have done so through deals with special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. Rivian held a traditional and more direct initial public offering.', 'Many companies that went the SPAC route have faced financial problems or received inquiries from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission into their deals to go public or other business matters.', 'Scaringe believes some of those companies won’t be competitors Rivian needs to worry about for much longer.', '“As the financial markets shifted from a growth orientation to more sort of a value orientation, I think a lot of those really underfinanced SPACs and companies like that are going to slowly start disappearing,” he said. “They’re going to run out of capital.”', 'Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently said the car company would make a “dedicated robotaxi.” He didn’t offer a timeframe or any additional details beyond saying it would “look futuristic” and be fully self-driving, something the company has not achieved despite the name of its “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) driver-assist feature.', 'Rivian has not announced plans for similar vehicle, and Scaringe wouldn’t comment on a counterpart directly. But he said the company will “offer lots of different products in the future.”', 'Scaringe, who moved from Southern California to near the 3.3 million-square-foot plant, is known as a driven, level-headed planner who typically lets his actions speak louder than his words (or tweets). It’s a different style from Musk, though both are considered extremely detail-oriented and ambitious leaders.', 'Rivian became the first automaker to begin mass production of an all-electric pickup truck last year, beating to market Tesla and longtime segment leaders General Motors and Ford Motor, which holds a roughly 12% stake in Rivian.', 'GM started shipping its GMC Hummer EV pickup in December, months after Rivian launched the R1T. Ford is expected to soon begin shipping an electric version of its F-150 pickup, called the F-150 Lightning, followed by Tesla’s long-delayed Cybertruck, which is planned to go into production next year.', 'While there have been many comparisons of the Rivian R1T to the other electric pickups, Scaringe isn’t bothered by the competition. He actually welcomes it, for now. He believes there’s currently more than enough demand to fulfill EV pickup production in the near term.', '“Humans have an infatuation with winners and losers, like everything in life has to be a zero-sum game,” he said. “I really just don’t see it that way. ... I look at it as I hope Hummer’s wildly successful. I truly do. I hope Lightning’s wildly successful, and I hope we’re wildly successful. And I think all three of those can happen from an intellectual honesty point of view.”']"

Due to the global pandemic and weak supply chains for critical goods like microchips and semiconductors, American consumers are feeling the stress of inflation at the supermarket and used car lots. The good news is that Congress is working to find agreement on a bipartisan innovation bill that addresses these issues by strengthening our supply chains, supercharging American innovation and helping America outcompete nations like China.', 'We must take urgent action to make critical investments in American innovation, reduce our reliance on despotic regimes and expand economic cooperation with our allies across the globe. The bipartisan innovation bill will not only be good for our economy and our pocketbooks, it’s also critical for our national security. The Russian war in Ukraine and escalating Chinese aggression toward Taiwan show why Congress must swiftly send this legislation to the President’s desk.', 'Following World War II, the U.S. established a global rules-based order that values democracy, free markets, and human rights. We made a generational investment in groundbreaking basic research that has driven American innovation since. We invented the microchip and supplied the world with this critical technology. Now, however, the U.S. finds itself overly reliant on external partnerships to maintain and increase our technological edge. Experts in national security and intelligence recognize that our investment in research and development is insufficient and our unrivaled human capital is underutilized.', 'In addition, the security of our supply chains is under threat as Russia invades a sovereign neighbor that is a key agricultural exporter and China threatens the independence of Taiwan, which supplies 90% of the world’s chips. Depending on critical materials from autocrats, whether minerals from Russia or semiconductors from China, puts the security of the U.S. and our allies at risk. In just a few weeks, we’ve seen how Europe’s dependence on Russian energy has made it vulnerable to supply chain disruptions and limited its ability to take action against a murderous tyrant. We could be in a similar bind if China invades Taiwan, causing us to lose our largest source of semiconductors.', 'The New Democrat Coalition led the charge for this legislation and helped pass a strong innovation bill that will strengthen our supply chains, advance American scientific and technological leadership, and ensure America leads the global economic order. America once led the semiconductor market, and we can do it again. The bipartisan innovation bill will keep us competitive by increasing manufacturing everywhere and helping American businesses supply the world. It invests in research — including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotechnology, and advanced energy — and domestic microchip and semiconductor manufacturing.', 'The U.S. is already increasing domestic production. Intel recently announced a new chips production facility in Columbus, Ohio, and this legislation will turbocharge these efforts. Ramping up production at home will enable us to meet high demand and reduce inflationary pressures, produce more goods, and prepare for the future so events on the other side of the world don’t impact Americans’ lives. Failure to boost production at home and in allied nations leaves us vulnerable to supply disruptions.', 'This bill will also help bolster diplomatic ties with Taiwan and respond to the Chinese government’s genocide of the Uyghurs through sanctions, export control restrictions, and multilateralism. By advancing this legislation, we can defend democracy, diversify and secure global supply chains, help American businesses relocate operations back to the U.S. and allied nations, and reinforce trading partnerships with nations like South Korea and Australia. When America leads, our world is safer.', 'By quickly passing and enacting the bipartisan innovation bill, we will set America up to lead the 21st century innovation economy with democratic values, create long-term supply chain stability in an uncertain world, and counter the influence of tyrants and autocrats around the world.

These companies  are producing chips that fuel new technologies including Internet  of Things, virtual reality and data centers. ', '  This has more than offset the struggles they have witnessed from  the weak PC market. Shares of the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF,  which tracks the performance of U.S. semiconductors, is up 21  percent year to date, while some individual names have boasted  gains well over 100 percent.', ' More from Estimize:', ' Will Intuitive Surgical’s Run Come to an End this  Quarter?', ' Watch These 3 Things When Intel Reports Quarterly  Earnings', '  These 5 Tech Stocks are Poised to Pop this Earnings Season', '  For those reasons, this will be one of the more closely watched  sectors during earnings season. Analysts are expecting the  semiconductors space to build on its recent success and continue  driving shares higher. We get a first look at the space this week  starting with reports from Intel, Xilinx and Advanced Micro Devices.', '  Intel is prepared to announce its third-quarter results Tuesday  afternoon. It is the first major semiconductor to report this  earnings season and will likely set the tone for the rest of the  space. Earnings and revenue have consistently improved as the  company shifts its focus to high-growth markets. Meanwhile, Intel  indicated in its second conference call that PC demand was  beginning to gain traction. This is expected to lead to another  better-than-expected quarterly report.', '  Analysts surveyed at Estimize are calling for earnings per share  of 74 cents, roughly 12 percent higher than the same period last  year. That estimate has climbed 13 percent since Intel’s most  recent report in July. Revenue for the quarter is anticipated to  climb by 6 percent to $15.57 billion, marking a significant  improvement from previous reports. Shares are up 8.2 percent year  to date but have historically declined into the print.', '  Like many of its peers, Intel has shifted its focus to rapidly  growing markets such as AI, IoT, data centers and security. These  segments are expected to be key growth drivers as its legacy  business continues to struggle. Client computing revenue was down  3 percent in the second quarter primarily due to a slowdown in  the PC market and weak IT spending. Shareholders should remain  cautious with regards to the PC market, despite earlier comments  about a recovery.', '  Intel also faces a number of imminent threats that could pressure  growth and market share for multiple quarters.  Google-parent Alphabet, IBM and seven  others have joined hands to take on Intel’s Data Center Group.  The consortium’s impact remains to be seen, but Intel management  would be wise to not take it lightly.', '  Shortly after Intel, Xilinx is scheduled to release its fiscal  second-quarter results. Xilinx has been firing on all cylinders  due in large part to improving demand in wireless and wired  communication segments and greater adoption in the automotive;  industrial, scientific and medical; test and aerospace and  defense markets. Additional efforts to tap into rapidly growing  cloud sectors, mainly 5G, could boost top line growth.  Expectations are exceedingly higher that Xilinx will build on its  recent winning streak in the quarter to be reported.', '  Analysts are calling for earnings per share of 56 cents on  $577.38 million in revenue, according to the Estimize consensus  data.

Shares  historically decline by 1 percent following an earnings report  despite topping expectations in 74 percent of reported quarters.', '  AMD closed last week with expectations at all-time highs. AMD had  been one of the most beaten-down companies consistently playing  catch up to Nvidia and  Intel. Today, it is one of the fastest growing companies and has  become a major player in both the high-powered graphics  processing unit and more basic central processing unit markets.  Its recent Polaris GPU and Zen processors released this quarter  are expected to keep AMD’s winning streak alive. These products  have received outstanding reviews and come at a more modest price  point than any comparable chips.', '  Meanwhile, AMD is making headway with its partnerships. AMD  recently signed a deal with Alibaba to provide the ecommerce  giant with GPUs in its cloud services. This provides AMD with a  growing presence in a market traditionally dominated by Nvidia.  These initiatives have led to investors flocking to the stock and  have encouraged analysts to raise estimates for this quarter.', '  Analysts polled at Estimize are calling for earnings per share of  1 cent, reflecting a 106 percent increase from a year earlier.  That estimate has increased 40 percent since AMD’s most recent  report in July. Revenue for the period is estimated to increase  15 percent to $1.22 billion, marking a second consecutive quarter  of positive growth.', '  Despite upbeat earnings, the semiconductor space faces multiple  near term headwinds. They include weak PC demand, exchange rate  volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly in Europe.  If these early reports can overcome those obstacles, expect  positive results from semiconductors this season.', '  How do you think these names will report?

Major players like Ambarella and Nvidia continually  crush expectations while others like AMD find it difficult to  stimulate growth. Still, overall worldwide semiconductor sales  are steadily declining, largely due to the slowdown in China,  currency headwinds and weak PC market.', 'Read more from Estimize: Earnings preview: Banks  reporting the nex two days (WFC, BAC, C) 3 things to watch when BlackRock  reports Q1 earnings 2 reasons why Delta may not fly  high this earnings season', '  Meanwhile, Apple’s meager sales growth last quarter is expected  to continue until the release of the iPhone 7, thereby forcing  suppliers to scale back production. The biggest names impacted by  this include Cirrus Logic and Qorvo, which have already posted  weaker guidance on first quarter earnings.', '  Fortunately, Intel kicked things off earlier this week with first  quarter earnings that beat expectations, possibly setting a  favorable tone for semiconductors this season. The company  reported earnings per share of $0.54 on $13.80 billion in sales.  Intel easily topped the Estimize consensus by 3 cents per share  but fell short on revenue by $200 million.

He compared Maxim to the equivalent of a C-student who  suddenly started getting B pluses and an occasional A minus. It  hasn’t gotten enough attention for its transformation, either.', '  That signaled to Cramer that there could be enormous upside  potential, as long as the company can continue to deliver strong  numbers.', '  In 2015, Maxim conducted a strategic review to determine what  businesses it should invest in, and found approximately $100  million in cost savings at its factories. Since then the company  has doubled down on power management, which is the largest and  fastest growing sub-category for the kind of analog chips it  specializes in.', '  But lately, those markets have slowed, so Maxim diversified its  power management business into the data center, automobile,  communications and the industrial market.', '  In 2012, only 24 percent of Maxim’s business came from those end  markets. By next year, they will encompass nearly two-thirds of  the company’s power management related sales.', '  Additionally, last year the company transitioned its research and  development budget to these faster-end markets. Maxim also has a  lot of older products with higher margins and not a lot of  growth, because once it puts its analog chips into any kind of  technology, they tend to stay there.', '  Maxim also reorganized all of these various products into one  business unit so there would be less confusion about where the  innovation is occurring. It was clear to Cramer that these  efforts are paying off when he saw the most recent quarter.', '  So while the semiconductor business has been roaring lately,  Cramer doesn’t think investors have missed the move on Maxim yet.', '  “Maxim Integrated Products has transformed itself into a much  better company with much less exposure to the consumer, and I  think we could still be in the early innings of this self-help  story,” Cramer said.', '  Questions for Cramer?

One of the top stocks in the  for the second year in a row, his dog’s namesake gave buyers a momentary chance to get into the stock last week before running back up to $166 and change as of Tuesday.', '', 'While investors who don’t already own shares of Nvidia might be late to the party, Boroden believes the stock still deserves their attention.', '“The stock occasionally gives you a pullback like last week ... and when that happens, it tends to really roll over as weak-handed bulls, who owned it only because it was going higher, decide to abandon ship,” Cramer said.', 'Boroden noted that Nvidia’s decline last week was similar to its past declines over the course of its rally. She also found two strong floors of support, from $151 to $152 and from $144 to $148.', 'After Nvidia grazed the first floor of support last week, dipping below $153, the stock bounced back hard, and Boroden believes it can continue to do the same going forward.', '“Given that August and September are brutal months where we often get short, sharp pullbacks ... you’ll want to watch this $152 level in case Nvidia gives you another buying opportunity,” Cramer suggested.', 'Based on Nvidia’s stock pattern to date, Boroden thinks the next pullback could come in mid-September. That said, she still gives the stock three upside targets: from $176 to $180, then from $187 to $188, and if the stock pushes past both, then she expects it to hit a ceiling at $209.', '“So, if you already own it, like my charitable trust does, Boroden thinks you could have smooth sailing until next month, and if you don’t own it, then maybe think about waiting for that next sell-off in September, if it holds these levels, to pull the trigger,” the “Mad Money” host said.', 'Micron’s stock is more boom-and-bust than Nvidia’s. Shares of the commodity chipmaker peaked in June and have drifted lower since before bouncing back on Monday.', 'With the stock up over $29 as of Tuesday’s closing bell, Boroden wouldn’t be shocked to see it climb to $34 or even $36. But if Micron breaks below its $25 floor of support, Boroden said that would start the “bust” part of its cycle.', '“Once Micron and its competitors start really boosting their production, pricing will eventually fall apart. The earnings estimates will get slashed,” Cramer said. “Of course, that’s been hanging over Micron’s head for ages. [It] hasn’t stopped the stock from rallying hard over the past 18 months, but it has most recently. Just remember that the run in Micron has a limited shelf-life.”', 'Applied Materials’ situation is similar, Boroden said: If the stock can hold above its floor of support in the low $40s, it could rally to the high $40s or even the low $50s.', 'But just like the others, if Applied Materials dips below $41 or its second floor of support just above $40, then Boroden suggests investors ditch the semiconductor equipment stock.', '“The charts ... show you how to approach the likes of Nvidia, Micron and Applied Materials when they get hit,” Cramer said. “And given that we’re in a historically rough time of year, I bet they’ll get hit again in the not-too-distant future. When that happens, I’m very on board with Nvidia. I like Applied Materials. Micron? At this point, it is too boom and bust for me, and I do believe the easy money has been made and then some.”', 'Disclosure: Cramer’s charitable trust owns shares in Nvidia.']"

The machines are made by only one company: Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography.', '“ASML has a monopoly on the fabrication of EUV lithography machines, the most advanced type of lithography equipment that’s needed to make every single advanced processor chip that we use today,” said Chris Miller, assistant professor at the Fletcher School at Tufts University. “The machines that they produce, each one of them is among the most complicated devices ever made.”', 'EUV stands for extreme ultraviolet, an incredibly short wavelength of light that ASML generates in large quantities to print small, complex designs on microchips. The EUV light is created with tiny explosions of molten tin happening at extreme speeds and then bounced off unique Zeiss mirrors that ASML says are the flattest surface in the world. A small percentage of the EUV light particles reach the surface of a silicon wafer, where they print the minuscule designs that determine what each chip will do.', 'Demand for ASML’s EUV technology has soared during a global chip shortage that’s resulted in back orders for products ranging from PlayStation 5 consoles to Chevrolet Malibu sedans. The company’s stock price has skyrocketed more than 340% since the end of 2018, making ASML more valuable than some of its top customers, such as Intel.', 'ASML CEO Peter Wennink said the company has been bringing down semiconductor prices since it was founded 38 years ago and will keep doing so “for the next couple of decades.”', '“The world needs more chips,” Wennink told CNBC. “So we need to make more machines, which, by the way, will keep growing in average selling price as long as we can drive the cost per transistor down.”', 'Still, Wennink says the global chip shortage is “a Catch-22” for ASML.', '“We got a lot of messages from our suppliers that said, ‘Hey, we might be late in delivering our modules to you guys because we cannot get the chips.’ And we said, ‘If we cannot get the chips, we cannot make the machines to make more chips.’”', 'Wennink said ASML is still managing “but it’s a daily struggle.”', 'ASML has sold a total of about 140 EUV systems in the past decade, each one now costing up to $200 million, according to Wennink. The price tag for its next machine, called High NA, will be more than $300 million.', 'Its EUV machine is “so expensive that most companies cannot afford it,” said Joanne Itow, managing director of manufacturing at Semico Research. “It certainly has eliminated a lot of players out of the market,” including chip manufacturer GlobalFoundries, which decided a few years ago to stop working on more-advanced chips because of the high cost, she said.', 'Today, ASML sells the machines to only five chipmakers. The biggest three — Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung and Intel — made up nearly 84% of its business in 2021. TSMC says that in 2019 it was the first to deliver high-volume chips made with EUV and that it has stayed in front ever since, with chip technology at least one node ahead of Samsung’s and Intel’s.', 'ASML’s dominance is a relatively new phenomenon. A decade ago, the company’s ability to research EUV was decided by major investments from Intel, Samsung and TSMC. ', '“We didn’t have the money,” said Wennink, who joined ASML in 1999. “So we went out and we found partners, which actually was the basis of the way we built the company. So we were forced to be a system architect and a system integrator.”', 'ASML started out as a subsidiary of Dutch electronics giant Philips in 1984. It launched its first machine for semiconductor lithography — which had been invented in a U.S. military lab in the 1950s — out of a leaky shed next to a Philips office building in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.', '“The first lithography tool really looked like a projector,” said Christophe Fouquet, ASML’s executive vice president of EUV. “There is basically a reticle, which holds the image that you want to project. Then there is an optical system, which is going to take this image and project it on the wafer.”', 'By 1988, ASML had five U.S. offices with 84 employees and a new Dutch office in Veldhoven that eventually became its headquarters. CNBC got an exclusive tour of that facility in March.', '“When the industry was getting ready to jump into the early stages of EUV research, none of the U.S. firms were ready to take the plunge on what would be an expensive and risky proposition, whereas ASML was,” said Miller, author of the forthcoming book “Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology.” “ASML is a Dutch company, but it’s also a Dutch company that relies very heavily on U.S. components in particular for its machines.”', 'EUV machines are made up of several modules with hundreds of thousands of components, from nearly 800 global suppliers. Each module is built at one of ASML’s 60 locations around the world and then shipped to Veldhoven for assembly. After each assembled machine is tested, it’s disassembled for shipment to a chipmaker. The shipping requires 20 trucks and three fully loaded Boeing 747s. ', 'One country ASML won’t ship its EUV technology to is China.', '“Forty-two countries around the globe have agreed to put export control measures on it because it’s so critical,” Wennink said. “So it’s not our choice, it’s the choice of governments.”', 'As far back as 2018, the Trump administration reportedly pressed ASML not to sell EUV technology to Chinese companies. ', '“China has wanted to get into that race,” Itow said, “but there’s been politically generated reasons why China has not had access” to the technology.', 'ASML does deal with China in another capacity. The company refurbishes older lithography systems, called deep ultraviolet, or DUV, and sends many of those to the world’s most-populated country. Wennink said 96% of all machines ASML has ever sold are still working.', '“There’s a lot of debate about whether selling additional DUV equipment to China is also a national security risk, by letting China increase its ability to manufacture close-to-cutting-edge semiconductors,” Miller said. “I think there’s some chance that in the coming years, there are new restrictions that are imposed on ASML’s ability to sell DUV equipment to China as well.”', 'Before EUV, chipmakers could buy DUV lithography machines from three companies: ASML, Nikon and Canon. While Nikon, in Japan, is still a competitor in that market, ASML is the only option for EUV. Experts say it could take decades for any other company to catch up, both because of ASML’s proprietary technology and because it’s built complex, often exclusive, deals with hundreds of suppliers.', '“We’re unique to some of our customers, and some of our supplies are unique to us,” Wennink said. “And those almost symbiotic relationships, some people say, are worse than being married because you cannot divorce.”', 'One way ASML has insulated itself against supply chain risks is by purchasing some of its suppliers, such as Cymer in San Diego, where the EUV light source is produced. ASML also bought Berliner Glas, in 2020. Though a fire broke out at the Berlin site in January, Wennink said the damage won’t significantly impact system output this year.', 'ASML projects 20% sales growth in 2022 and annual revenue growth of 11% until the end of the decade.', 'Watch the video for a rare glimpse of the technology inside ASML’s clean rooms in California and the Netherlands, to see how EUV machines use precision lasers, exploding molten tin and ultra-flat surfaces to make the building blocks of our digital world.']"

But the stock has still tripled over the past year, making it the best performer in the . And according to Gordon, a look at the charts shows that the chipmaker’s almost 3 percent gain this week could suggest that history is about to repeat itself and that Nvidia is about to head higher.', 'Gordon specifically points to what he’s calling a “three-wave pullback,” in reference to the three previous times when Nvidia has fallen, only to then surge to new highs. Based on the length of the past pullbacks, the recent drop in Nvidia looks to be complete, according to Gordon, meaning that the stock will mirror past moves and rally.', '“We are right on top of the equality point, so basically this distance is equal to the prior correction,” he said Thursday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” “You see this kind of symmetry in the markets all the time. If you just know how to look for it, you can pick up some pretty good turning points.”', '', 'Since Nvidia looks to be at the tail end of its pullback, Gordon believes that the support level for the stock is between $135 and $140, which the shares have bounced up from in the past week. And since implied volatility, which measures the relative price of options, is so high, he wants to make a bullish bet on Nvidia by selling options rather than buying them..', '', 'As a result, Gordon is selling the July 21 140-strike puts and buying the July 21 135-strike puts for $2.04 total, or $204 credit per options spread.', 'Should Nvidia close above $140 on July 21 expiration, Gordon would get to keep that amount, for his maximum profit of $204. The trade breaks even at $137.96, and if Nvidia closes below $135 on July 21, Gordon would suffer the maximum loss of $296.', 'However, should the stock fall to $135 before expiration, Gordon would advocate exiting the trade, which would likely mean taking a smaller loss.', 'To be sure, the options are expensive for a reason. Nvidia shares traded in a nearly 4 percent range on Thursday alone. The stock’s volatile nature means that both bullish and bearish bets have a better chance of paying off than would options on most other stocks.']"

You can say, ‘Well, that’s overnight. I’m sleeping. It’s no big deal,’” Sheridan said. “But there’s times when you don’t have 10 hours to get on the road.”', 'If that same new technology is used inside the electric car, the car’s range could be increased by close to 30%, or the size of the battery could be decreased by 30%, both advantages in their own way.', 'But we probably won’t see it in new cars until at least 2025.', 'Gallium is a chemical element on the periodic table and a natural by-product created in the refining of other metals, like aluminum. “For decades, there was no known use for this material,” Sheridan said.', 'But when gallium is combined with nitrogen into gallium nitride (GaN), it’s useful for the semiconductors that go into the charging units for consumer electronics devices. A GaN semiconductor operates up to 20x faster than silicon and makes it possible to deliver up to 3x more power and 3x faster charging in half the size and weight.', 'The technology is still relatively new, and not widespread yet because it’s still more expensive and requires customers to redesign their entire charging systems. But Sheridan explains that the cost will come down as scale increases.', '“Now, it’s only 10 to 20% more expensive. Within two years, it’ll be the same cost or cheaper,” he says. “It’s a powerful chip. But to do it right, you have to redesign the whole power system around that chip and that requires a lot of new skills.”', 'Navitas works closely with its customers to help them make those changes.', '“We actually are very hands-on with our customers. We create design centers — just for mobile chargers, just for data centers, just for EVs — to specifically help those customers design the entire next generation power system using our GaN chip, because we have experts on all the other stuff, not just the GaN chip, to help them do it. So there’s quite a bit of learning curve.”', 'In the last three years, Navitas shipped over 35 million units with its GaN technology to customers like Chinese smartphone brand and manufacturer Vivo, Dell and Chinese consumer electronics manufacturer Xiaomi.  ', 'To get to this point, Navitas has raised over $100 million in several rounds of funding and is bringing in revenues of about $20 million a year. The company is not profitable yet, but aims to be in 2023. In October, Navitas Semiconductor went public via SPAC and has a market cap of over $ 1 billion.', 'The initial focus for Navitas will be home charging systems for electric vehicles, which are “pretty darn slow,” as Sheridan said, as opposed to publicly located supercharging stations.', 'But it could take years for Navitas to get electric vehicle makers to build GaN superconductor technology into their charging infrastructures and cars.', '“You can’t show up to an existing car and just drop it in and it magically makes things charge faster, be more efficient,” Sheridan acknowledges.', 'It takes three to four years for electric vehicles to be developed, and so it will likely be 2025 before GaN-enabled electric vehicles will be shipping and on streets.', 'But that education and collaboration process with businesses has begun.', 'In January, Navitas opened a center in Shanghai, China, to work with electric vehicle manufacturers to develop their own GaN systems.', 'So far, no electric vehicle makers have publicly declared they are switching to GaN systems, but BRUSA HyPower — a power electronics supplier to top European players like Porsche, Audi and Volkswagen — has publicly announced a partnership with Navitas.', 'GaN supercondutor technology will do more for EVs than just make them charge faster.', 'Once the power gets into the battery in an electric vehicle, then it has to to the wheels. Right now, that’s happening with silicon semiconductors. As the power travels from the battery to the wheels, 30% or more of the energy is lost in a transmission, Sheridan said.', 'If GaN superconductors are used in that transmission, then you can use a smaller battery or have the same size battery take a car further.', '“I can’t take all the energy lost to zero, but I can take a big chunk of that 30% of energy that’s wasted and save it by a more efficient technology in GaN,” Sheridan said.', '“If you think about what holds any buyer back from EV, it is still more expensive than a gas car because the cost of that battery, so anything you can do to use a cheaper, lighter weight battery” will be beneficial for brining the price down, Sheridan said.', 'Other reasons that consumers are hesitant to switch to electric vehicles is “range anxiety,” which could be helped by making the efficiency inside an electric vehicle better with GaN technology. “And then of course, you got the slow charging nature of this thing. It’s just not as fast as filling up a gas tank. And so we’re trying to close the gap on those three items.”']"

His firm has already adjusted its forecast to cut 700,000 units of European production, he said.', 'The European auto market will feel the effects far more quickly than the U.S. and other markets. European automakers such as Audi and Mercedes-Benz have said they plan to cut production output at plants due to parts disruptions out of Ukraine — specifically, wire harnesses.', '“Wire harnesses are the most critical near-term bottleneck, in our view, already causing significant production interruption amongst all German OEMs,” UBS analyst Patrick Hummel said Monday in an investor note. “We think significant downtimes in the next few weeks are likely, but limited to European production because wire harnesses are typically sourced regionally.”', 'AutoForecast Solutions expects vehicle production this year in Russia and Ukraine to get cut in half as a result of the conflict, falling to around 800,000 units.', 'An early “pessimistic outlook” from research firm IHS Markit expects the global impact this year to be about 3.5 million fewer vehicles in connection with semiconductor chip constraints. Russia and Ukraine are critical sources of neon gas and palladium that are used to produce semiconductor chips.', 'However, Tim Urquhart, a European principal automotive analyst at IHS, noted the situation remains fluid. In December, IHS forecast global sales of 82.4 million vehicles in 2022, up 3.7% year over year.', 'As sanctions grow and companies withdraw or suspend operations in Russia, the country’s automotive operations face long-term risk.', 'Automakers and other industries are going to have to weigh the potential backlash of resuming operations against the potential earnings, according to experts.', '“The key for companies is to provide a concrete justification as to why they’re going back in,” said Matt Gorman, a corporate communications advisor and Republican strategist. “They can’t slink back in if we’re still in the same spot and if Russians are still shelling Ukrainian civilians a month from now or two months from now.”', 'For automakers, the choice may be easier than for others. Only a few automakers have notable operations in Russia. France-based Renault Group, which has a controlling stake in Russian automaker AvtoVAZ, accounts for 39.5% of the country’s vehicle production, followed by South Korea-based Hyundai Group at 27.2%.', 'German automaker Volkswagen makes up a 12.2% share of the country’s auto output, according to research firm IHS Markit.

Some Asian countries rely on commodities such as fertilizer from Russia, and a global shortage is already driving up prices of agriculture and grains.', 'Given the region’s relatively high levels of dependence on energy and agricultural commodity imports – even if countries don’t source directly from Russia or Ukraine, the spike in prices will be concerning, warned the EIU.', '“Niche dependencies include reliance on Russia and Ukraine as a source of fertiliser and grain in South-east and South Asia, which could cause disruption in the agricultural sector,” said the firm.', 'The world’s major powers have hit Russia with wide-ranging sanctions over Russia’s unprovoked war on Ukraine.

It has been a major source of weaponry for China, India and Vietnam over the past two decades, the EIU pointed out.', '“International sanctions on Russian defence firms will impede the future access of Asian countries to these arms,” the research firm said.', 'However, that will also create new opportunities for manufacturers from other countries, as well as domestic producers, the report said.', 'Countries most dependent on Russian arms imports from 2000-2020, ranked by share of total imports', 'While Asia’s air routes are still open to Russian airlines, tourists from the country may not visit, the EIU pointed out.', '“Tourism is the main potential exposure within services trade, and with Asian air routes still open to Russian airlines, unlike those in Europe, such trade could continue (and potentially expand),” the research firm said.', '“However, the willingness of Russians to travel will probably be affected by economic disruption, rouble depreciation and the withdrawal of international payment services from Russia,” it added.', 'Several Russian banks have also been cut out of SWIFT, a global system connecting more than 11,000 member banks in some 200 countries and territories globally.', 'Meanwhile, the ruble initially dived nearly 30% against the dollar as the war began. Since then, the currency has bounced back but was last trading about 10% lower than the start of the year, hurting the wallets of ordinary Russians.', 'However, the reliance on Russian tourists is still low in Asia.', 'Thailand was the largest beneficiary in the region in 2019, receiving 1.4 million Russian visitors, according to the EIU. Still, that accounted for only less than 4% of its total arrivals that year. Vietnam was second, while Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Maldives round up the top five Asian destinations for Russian tourists.', '“Without the conflict, however, Russian tourism could have increased in importance, given ongoing curbs on outgoing Chinese travellers,” said the EIU.']"
