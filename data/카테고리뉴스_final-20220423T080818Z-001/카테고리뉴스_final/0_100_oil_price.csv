16,"How to know when oil prices will cause a recession, and what to invest in ",2022-03-06T16:47:11+0000,"['With the national average for a gallon of gas hitting its highest price since 2008 and the stock market on edge with the first land war in Europe since WWII being waged by one of the world’s biggest crude oil producers, crude oil prices and energy stocks are an area of focus for investors. It is hard for stock market participants to avoid the question, are energy stocks, which have had a huge run since the pandemic bottom, still a buy given the geopolitical premium? But the related question could stop them in their tracks before continuing: will oil prices cause a recession?', 'Bespoke noted last week that as of Friday morning, WTI crude oil was up just over 20% within the week, one of five periods where crude rallied more than 20% in a week. It noted that three of the prior four periods where prices spiked occurred during recessions.', 'Rystad Energy, one of the top global energy sector consulting and research firms, expects a plunge in Russian oil exports of as much as 1 million barrels per day — and limited Middle Eastern spare capacity to replace these supplies — to result in a net impact that oil prices are likely to continue to climb, potentially beyond $130 per barrel, and relief measures such as releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve can’t make up the difference.', 'There is of course disagreement and contrarian takes. Citi’s commodities team wrote last week it is becoming “probable” that oil prices have peaked already or could soon consolidate near a top. But that would require a de-escalation in the Russia invasion of Ukraine and progress on Iran talks. U.S. inventories are at or near lows, but Citi says stock builds are on the way in 2Q′22. ', 'For Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, this is a good time to look at the value of energy stocks in a diversified portfolio and how to think about the risk of oil prices causing a recession.', 'As an analyst covering the auto sector earlier in his career, Colas remembers the presentation decks used by economists employed by the “Big Three” automakers three decades ago, which they had been using since the 1970s oil shocks.', '“The rule of thumb I learned from auto industry economics in the 1990s is that if oil prices go up 100% in a one-year period, expect a recession,” he says.', 'A year ago, crude oil was $63.81 (March 4, 2021) a barrel. Double that and that is the strike price for a recession. On Friday, WTI crude was at $115 — by Monday, crude oil had touched the $130 level as talks between the U.S. and allies about a ban on Russian oil imports picked up.', '“We are close and getting there fast,” Colas said.', '“We’re at the point now where prices at the pump are higher on the way home from work than on the way in,” Bespoke wrote in a note to clients on Friday.', 'But Colas added oil prices would need to be persistently over that doubling, staying at $130 rather than merely spiking and pulling back quickly, to be concerned. “A day or two is OK, but a few weeks is not,” he said. ', 'A big caveat: the evidence isn’t deep. “Recessions don’t come along that often, so we’re talking three periods since 1990,” Colas said.', 'Other market analysis argues that this is not the 1970s, and oil represents a much smaller part of GDP and economic consumption than it did then. A JPMorgan analysis from last fall made the case that equity markets would hold up in an environment even with oil prices as high as $130 to $150.', 'Still, underneath it all, oil prices drive gas prices and the consumer is 70% of the U.S. economy. “When you take that much money out of their pocket, it has to come from somewhere else,” Colas said.', 'The spike in oil and gasoline prices comes just as commuting is returning to normal again as well, with more companies calling back workers across the country as the omicron wave of Covid has declined.', 'Office occupancy is currently running at 35%-37%, and there is about to be much more commuting and miles driven with as much as 65% of workers currently at home for at least part of the week needing to commute in, which will increase pressure on gas prices. Gas usage in the U.S. has been climbing steadily, near 8.7 million barrels, and trending up quickly.', 'The return to offices is not necessarily a bad thing for the economy, as urban growth relies on it, but at the same, Colas says a broader economic environment with oil prices persistently above a 100% annual increase likely outweighs those benefits to GDP: “Can we grow if oil prices stay here at 100%? Recent history says no.”', 'He said there is evidence from recent periods when spikes in oil prices didn’t spell doom for the economy, but there was a key difference between those periods and today. Previous periods which were close to recession-inducing levels, but when no economic contraction occurred, include 1987 (+85%) and 2011 (81%).', '“The issue here is that oil prices may have risen quickly, but they were nowhere near unusually high levels relative to the recent past. Consumers, in other words, had already mentally budgeted for those levels and while they were certainly unwelcomed they were not a complete surprise,” Colas wrote in a recent note to clients. “In 1987 we got a large spike on a percentage basis, but not on an absolute basis versus the prior few years. From 2011 – 2014, the percent change off the 2009 – 2010 bottom hit 80 percent, but on an absolute basis WTI was in line with the immediate pre-crisis past.”', 'The past decade has not been kind to the energy sector of the S&P 500 and most investors are underweight energy stocks. As of now, the energy sector is 3.8% of the U.S. stock market. Even as energy stocks have bounced since the pandemic low of March 2020, their overall market profile has not risen. Consider that Apple (7%), Microsoft (6%) and Alphabet (4.2%) each have larger weights in the U.S. stock market than the entire energy sector.', 'Farther back, energy was 29% of the S&P 500 in December 1980 after a decade of oil shocks and huge gas price spikes. It was, more or less, what technology represents in the U.S. stock market today. Energy is a fundamental underweight, and the reason for that has been understandable: energy has been either the worst-performing or second-worst performing sector in seven of the past 10 years.', 'Nevertheless, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway recently doubled down on its Chevron investment (increased by about 30%) and last week revealed a $5 billion stake in Occidental Petroleum.', 'It is possible that even if oil prices are a probable cause of a recession right now, energy stocks — represented by sector ETFs such as XLE — are still buys.', 'This doesn’t mean energy stocks would avoid the pain of a recession. The best thing for energy stocks isn’t a rapid spike in oil prices like the one the economy is experiencing now, but a gradual rise. Stocks in the sector may not even be positive in a recession, but they may still outperform other sectors. “All correlations go to one if the VIX is at 50,” Colas said, referring to a measure of market volatility that would signal a crash. But he noted that the equity market, so far, doesn’t want to crash based on its rebound from spikes in the VIX into the 30s as recently as last week. And the current geopolitical events and overall supply-demand imbalance in the crude market suggest that current oil prices are sustainable. Combined with the energy sector’s diminished weight in the S&P 500, the sector’s valuation as a whole, “is just ridiculous,” Colas said.', 'This is not the 1970s, and energy is not going back to that prominence in the market on a relative sector basis, but as recently as 2017, when market pundits were talking about oil companies as being valued “terminally,” the sector was still over 6% of the market. Buying the trough in 2020, when the sector fell to as low as 2% of the index, was wise, but Colas says 3.8% isn’t the number that says it is time to sell. “I don’t know the right number, but I know even in 2019 it was 5% of the index.” ', 'For Colas, doing the math on energy stocks as still being undervalued is simple: In 2011, the energy sector weighting in the S&P 500 was almost triple its current index representation, as high as 11.3%, and when energy was at similar prices. “What else do you need?” he said.', 'Investors should be very focused on hedging risk in the stock market right now, and maybe only in the U.S. with energy stocks. In Europe, energy stocks were hit hard last week, which shows the case for U.S. energy isn’t about oil prices alone. “European equities are just getting demolished. We don’t share a land mass with Russia,” Colas said. ', 'All of this leads Colas to conclude that for investors looking at the stock market in this environment, “if you want to win, it’s energy.”', 'A recent update from S&P Global Market Intelligence showed energy shorts to have reached the highest level since 2020, but the details show that while there are a few big bets against “wildcat”-style drillers, these short bets are more likely to be in other energy niches, including in renewable energy spots like EV charging, as well as in the coal sector, rather than among the biggest oil and gas producers. The biggest U.S. oil companies, in fact, had less short interest than the S&P 500 as a whole.', '“The biggest rookie mistake an analyst can make is trying to short a new high,” Colas said. “Never short a new high.”', '″$130 is the max for oil,” he said. “We don’t often see more than 100% return. But oil stocks are so cheap and good dividend payers.”   ']"

Under the recommendation, shareholders would receive one bonus share for every 10 shares owned. As a result, the total dividend for 2021 is $75 billion in cash, in addition to bonus shares. ', 'The profit figures are a stark contrast from the company’s 2020 earnings, which saw a 44% drop on the previous year due to demand collapse brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. ', 'Nasser at the time described Aramco’s 2020 financial year as one of its most “challenging years” in recent history. ', 'The company also said it would invest to increase crude oil production capacity to 13 million barrels per day by 2027, expand its liquid to chemical production, and look to increase gas production by more than 50% by 2030.

Scope 1 refers to direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by the company, while Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from the generation of purchased power consumed by the company.', '“We’re doing our part, but it’s not enough. Other players in the industry also need to do their part and increase investment,” Nasser said, saying demand for oil will continue to accelerate in coming years.

I wouldn’t rule out lines, shortages or $6 [price] in places beyond California,” said Tom Kloza, head of global energy research at OPIS. “I wouldn’t say it’s a shortage yet. Europe, I think they’re headed for a shortage.”', 'A drop in demand if prices become too high could temper that outcome. The low supply of diesel fuel is the result of a loss of refining capacity worldwide, after Covid wreaked havoc on the oil industry.', 'Kloza said it is the middle of the barrel — diesel — that has been hit the hardest.', 'Since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, the price of oil has traded much higher, with volatile swings. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were at about $107 per barrel Wednesday, after trading as high as $130.50 on worries about shortages due to sanctions on Russia.', '“When you’re seeing crude rallying, you’ve seen diesel outpacing it just because of supply concerns. We’re already at eight-year lows for distillate inventories,” said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst Americas at Kpler.', '“So what you’re really seeing is while everyone is focused on the crude side of things, prices have really been pushing on because Europe is short diesel and it has to import a lot of diesel, whereas it exports gasoline,” he added. “While there’s obviously concerns about the crude side of the picture, ultimately diesel is what the end-user needs.”', 'While gasoline prices at the pump have held steady over the past week, the price of diesel continued to rise, gaining about 8 cents per gallon to a national average of $5.12 per gallon, according to AAA. The national average for unleaded gasoline is $4.23 per gallon, up from $2.86 a year ago.', 'The price of diesel, however, was $2.03 per gallon cheaper at this time last year. For a truck that fuels up with 125 gallons or more, that several hundred dollars extra at every filling can result in higher costs for anyone who buys anything that gets shipped, from food to home goods to automobiles.', '“The spread between diesel and motor fuel is the widest it’s ever been in the data,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “It’s $1 a gallon ... the average over the last few decades has been 30 to 40 cents. That gives you a sense of how out of balance it is. ... By my calculation, one-tenth of the acceleration in [consumer price] inflation [over the past year] is due to the surge in diesel prices.”', 'That contribution to inflation includes related impacts.', '“The farmer ploughing the field, getting the food to the store shelf: It’s the cost to FedEx and UPS getting the product we’re buying to the front porch — all of those ancillary knock-on effects,” Zandi said.', 'But for goods price inflation, for everything from production to shipping, the contribution of diesel prices to inflation is even greater. Zandi calculates that 17% of the acceleration of goods price inflation is due to the higher diesel costs.', '“Diesel is used in farming. It’s used in a lot of industrial processes. All the machinery runs on diesel. A lot of construction runs on diesel,” said Francisco Blanch, global head of commodities and derivatives research at Bank of America. “I think it’s very problematic. Trucks run on diesel, trains run on diesel, and planes run on jet fuel which is also diesel.”', 'Since marine fuel rules changed in 2020, ships have switched to cleaner fuels, like marine gasoil, a type of diesel fuel. Heating oil is also diesel fuel, and diesel trades under the heating oil contract on the CME.', 'Blanch notes that before Russia invaded Ukraine, its crude exports totaled 5.5 million barrels a day, with just over half going to Europe. But Russia also exported 2.4 million barrels a day of refined products, including more than 1.1 million barrels a day of diesel exports. About half of the refined products also went to Europe.

Almost every human activity has some element of diesel consumption,” Blanch said. “In Europe, half the cars run on diesel.” ', 'Zandi said higher diesel prices spark an inflation that is “corrosive to the economy’s ability to grow,”', '“The world’s businesses run on diesel, and diesel is at record highs and as high as it’s ever been relative to motor fuel costs, and that’s bleeding into inflation in a meaningful way. That has negative consequences,” he said.', 'Typically, analysts say diesel is cheaper than gasoline at this time of year. Some analysts say there could be just limited shortages of diesel.', '“On the margin, we just have a very tight oil complex right now. Part of the reason is that the refining system and the supply of diesel fuel is so tight,” said Kurt Barrow, vice president of oil and downstream at S&P Global Commodity Insights. “We had a significant number of refinery shutdowns because of the energy transition, combined with the Covid low demand period.”', 'Barrow said the global refining industry is down about 3.5 million barrels a day of refining capacity from pre-Covid levels, with about 1 million barrels a day of that in the U.S. and another 0.6 million barrels a day in Europe.', 'As the economy has reopened, diesel supplies were already tight.', '“When you take 600,000 barrels a day of Russian exports out of a tight market, that’s what adds pressure,” Barrow said.', 'According to S&P Global, the U.S. consumed about 9.3 million barrels of gasoline per day in 2019 and another 4.1 million barrels of diesel fuel. For Europe, the mix was much different. Gasoline consumption was just 2.1 million barrels compared with 6.8 million barrels a day for diesel fuel.', 'The cure to high prices may already be showing up.', 'In the past week, diesel demand fell to 3.8 million barrels a day in the U.S. from 4.5 million the week earlier, according to the Energy Information Administration.', '“It’s a big drop in diesel fuel demand,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital. “Five and six bucks will do that.”', 'While the national average is $5.12 per gallon, prices at the pump in California are an average $6.44, according to AAA. In New York, diesel is an average $5.34 per gallon; $5.17 per gallon in Florida and $4.86 per gallon in Texas.', 'Kilduff said there may be more relief on the horizon.', 'U.S. refiners have increased their operating rate to 92%, much higher than last year, he said. Some refineries can also change the mix of fuels they produce, and could increase diesel production.', 'But there are more complicated issues impacting refining.', 'The Covid lockdowns in 2020 resulted in a sharp drop in oil and fuel demand, and have made for imbalances as the refinery industry first responded to sudden shutdowns and then ramped up as demand grew. Not all refineries have come back online, and two in the U.S. are in the process of transitioning to become biofuel facilities.', '“This is a ‘gap year’ for worldwide refiners,” Kloza noted. “North America has seen the closure of about 1.2 million barrels a day of refining since just before Covid.”', 'Refineries in California, North Dakota, Wyoming and Newfoundland are among those that have been or are in the process of being repurposed to make renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuels, he added.', 'Kloza said there will be some relief next year when huge new refineries come online in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and West Africa. Those refineries are designed to maximize yields of fuels including diesel and jet fuel, he added.', 'The amount of diesel in storage in the U.S. is at an unusually low level', '“Diesel stocks have declined for the past year a half and are down by nearly 70 million barrels, to the lowest level since 2014,” Kilduff said. “There’s just 112 million barrels of diesel fuel in storage, compared to 141 million a year earlier.”', 'Inventories are 20% below the pre-pandemic five-year average, Kilduff added.', '“Right now the shortage is in diesel, and reserves are down to the ground,” Blanch said. “And that could move to gasoline because everyone is going to be maximizing diesel runs.”']"

You put $130 back in play if we actually start canceling Russian barrels.”', 'Pickering estimates that 2 million to 3 million barrels a day of waterborne Russian oil has been frozen out of the market, without immediate buyers. He said China and India are continuing to buy Russian crude. “I’m sure on the margins there will be others willing to take more over time,” he said.', 'Pickering said he’s not forecasting a return to $130 per barrel oil, but adds it could happen.

That is a central oil facility for crude traded in U.S. futures contracts. The lack of storage there could make for more volatility in the futures market, since the holder of a futures contract must take physical delivery when the contract expires.', 'In April 2020, that convergence led to a negative price for WTI oil as investors were forced to liquidate their positions at negative prices during a period of very low demand. Now, the opposite could cause price spikes during expiration, as investors try to buy, Blanch noted.', 'The April contract expires Tuesday. “Given the market is desperately short barrels in the near term, we see increased risk of a short squeeze as WTI moves towards expiry each month,” said Blanch.', 'The European Union is expected to discuss banning Russian crude, but there is disagreement among members.

When inflation rises, topline revenues can also go higher.', '“Everyone knows multiples have contracted, stocks have gotten cheaper, but one thing that’s gotten lost on investors is top-line revenues have this correlation with inflation,” he said. “Corporate profits and CPI [the consumer price index] are kind of connected. You have multiples contracting but earnings estimates are rising.”', 'Arone said stocks are reasonably positioned and investors are getting more comfortable that there will be a favorable resolution to the war.', '“If we can get past the Ukraine conflict and some of the fears about the Fed and inflation, I think the fundamentals are okay,” he said.', 'Monday ', '8:30 a.m. Advance economic indicators ', 'Tuesday ', '9:00 a.m. S&P/Case-Shiller home prices', '9:00 a.m. FHFA home prices', '9:00 a.m. New York Fed President John Williams', '9:30 a.m. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic', '10:00 a.m. Consumer confidence', '10:00 a.m. JOLTS ', '10:30 a.m. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker', 'Wednesday ', '8:15 a.m. ADP employment', '8:30 a.m. Real GDP ', '9:15 a.m. Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin', '1:00 p.m. Kansas City Fed President Esther George', 'Thursday ', '8:30 a.m. Initial claims', '8:30 a.m. Personal income', '8:30 a.m. PCE deflator', '9:00 a.m. New York Fed’s Williams', '9:45 a.m. Chicago PMI ', 'Friday ', 'Monthly vehicle sales', '8:30 a.m. Employment', '9:05 a.m. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans', '9:45 a.m. Manufacturing PMI', '10:00 a.m. ISM manufacturing', '10:00 a.m. Construction spending']"

WTI settled the day 4.5%, or $4.13, higher at $95.72 per barrel, while Brent gained 2.7% to trade at $100.55.', 'Both contracts broke above $100 on Thursday for the first time since 2014 after Russia invaded Ukraine. However, the initial spike was somewhat short lived with WTI and Brent retreating throughout Thursday’s session and into Friday’s trading after the White House’s first round of sanctions did not target Russia’s energy system.', 'At that point, traders thought the market was out of the woods in terms of a major interruption in supply, but there was a “remarkable escalation across the board” over the weekend and that put a risk premium back into prices, according to Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group.', 'He pointed to the decision to remove some Russian banks from the global interbank messaging system Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), impose measures on Russia’s central bank that prevents it from deploying its reserves and Russian President Vladimir Putin placing his nuclear deterrence forces on high alert.', '“We could go to $110 or $115 a barrel before it retraces,” he told CNBC’s “Street Signs Asia” on Monday.', 'On Saturday, the U.S., European allies and Canada said they would disconnect specific Russian banks from SWIFT.', '“This will ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally,” the global powers wrote in a joint statement announcing the retaliatory measure.', 'Russia is a key oil and gas supplier, especially to Europe. While the latest round of sanctions do not target energy directly, experts say there will be significant ripple effects.', '“The various banking sanctions make it highly difficult for Russian petroleum sales to occur now,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital. “Most banks will not provide basic financing, due to the risk of running afoul of sanctions.”', 'Putin could also decide to retaliate against the U.S. and allies’ action by weaponizing energy and turning off the taps directly.', '″[W]e do think a number of Western firms may decide that it is not worth the risk of continuing to do business with Russia given the uncertainty about enforcement and the trajectory of future coercive action,” RBC said Sunday in a note to clients.', 'OPEC and its oil-producing allies, which include Russia, are set to meet this week to determine the group’s production policy for April. The oil alliance has been increasing output by 400,000 barrels per day each month as it unwinds the historic production cuts of nearly 10 million barrels per day implemented in April 2020 as the pandemic took hold.', 'The group, as well as worldwide producers including the U.S., have kept oil supply in check as demand rebounded. Oil prices have been steadily climbing higher, with Russia’s invasion the catalyst that pushed crude above $100.', 'Consumers are feeling the impacts in the form of higher prices at the pump. The national average for a gallon of gas stood at $3.60 per gallon on Sunday, according to data from AAA. The White House has said it’s working to alleviate the burden for Americans.', '“Although the sanctions are still being crafted to avoid energy price shocks, we believe this aggressive-but-not-maximalist stance may not be sustainable, with disruptions to oil and gas shipments looking increasingly inevitable,” Evercore ISI wrote in a note to clients.', '“Russia is casting a long, dark, unpredictable, and very complicated shadow. The biggest potential negative from this for the US economy is a surge in oil prices,” the firm added.']"
81,Putin’s threats against Ukraine could reinvigorate the U.S. oil and gas industry ,2022-02-16T17:52:24+0000,"['Russian President Vladimir Putin has long made it clear that he is no fan of U.S. shale drilling. But, if he invades Ukraine, he may unwillingly help bring back the American industry.', 'Like other global producers, the U.S. industry was crushed by the pandemic in early 2020. Oil prices crashed, and prices for crude futures even turned negative on the CME for a brief time. An extremely chastened U.S. industry reemerged, with executives more cautious than ever about throwing money down oil wells and angering shareholders.', 'The U.S. industry has been making a slow comeback, helped by rising oil prices, which are up more than 50% in the last year. Putin’s threats against Ukraine have helped drive an already rising oil price well above $90 per barrel to a seven-year high, with nearly 30% of that price rise since the start of the year.', '“The last thing they wanted to do was provide a price incentive for a rebound in U.S. oil and gas production,” said Dan Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit. “They now succeeded in driving up prices, which is strengthening U.S. oil and gas production.”', 'Russia has historically been the largest provider of both oil and natural gas to Europe, and the U.S. has long warned that its control of critical energy sources could prove to be a hazard for European consumers. Yergin said Putin has been a strong opponent of U.S. shale, and as far back as 2013, the Russian president told a public forum in St. Petersburg that shale was a grave threat.', 'President Joe Biden said Tuesday that the U.S. and Russia would continue to use diplomatic channels to avoid a military outcome, but warned the situation remains uncertain. Russia announced Tuesday it was pulling back some of its more than 100,000 troops on the Ukraine border. By Wednesday, however, NATO said Russia instead was increasing its troops.', 'Oil rose Wednesday, with West Texas Intermediate futures for March up 2.6%, at about $94.50 per barrel in afternoon trading.', '“The geopolitics of energy is back with full fury,” Yergin said.', 'Energy is clearly at the center of the conflict. European natural gas prices have been flaring all winter on concerns about short supply. First, the region was unable to put enough natural gas into storage. Then, Russia cut back some supply starting in the fall.', 'Russia sends natural gas to Europe via pipelines running through Ukraine and others, including Nord Stream I. The Nord Stream II pipeline — built to bring gas from Russia to Germany — is finished but still awaiting German approval.', 'Biden repeated Tuesday that if Russia invades Ukraine, that pipeline will not be allowed to operate.', 'Should Russia invade, the U.S. and its allies plan on imposing sanctions on the country, and analysts say a worst-case scenario for energy supplies would be either that the sanctions block Russian energy sales to Europe or Russia chokes off the supply in retaliation.', 'This comes as global oil demand has been moving back toward normal and is expected to pick up even more this summer as air travel improves.', 'Before the pandemic, the U.S. was the largest producer of both oil and gas. Yergin said the U.S. energy industry has regained its position of dominance, and is once more the top oil and gas producer.', 'In addition, the U.S. is a large exporter. The U.S. exported an average 2.6 million barrels a day of oil over the past four weeks, and 4.2 million barrels of refined products, including gasoline and diesel fuel, according to the Energy Information Administration weekly data.', 'The U.S. energy industry has also already proven to be an important alternative supplier for Europeans. In January, ships filled with U.S. liquefied natural gas were diverted from Asia and South America to European ports. According to IHS, that 80% year-over-year jump in LNG imports meant that the U.S., for the first time, provided more natural gas to Europe via ship than Russia did through its pipelines.', 'IHS Markit calculates that 7.73 billion cubic meters of U.S. gas was shipped to Europe in January, compared with 7.5 billion cubic meters through Russia’s pipelines.', 'While U.S. LNG is helping Europe through the winter, it is not a sufficient replacement for Russian gas. Europe can process only so much liquefied natural gas, and analysts say it would still have a shortfall. Qatar also ships LNG to Europe and has capacity to increase its exports.', '“This is the highest level of US LNG to Europe that we’ve ever seen. Looking at European imports from the US so far this month, they are holding up so we expect to see a similar level for February (over 5 million tonnes),” note Kpler analysts in an email to CNBC.', 'Yergin said Europe is the natural market for Russia’s gas. “Europe was in an energy crisis before the Ukraine crisis. The difference now as opposed to 2009, when the Russians interrupted gas flow through Ukraine, the European pipeline system is more flexible, so it can move gas around, and there’s the development of LNG,” he said. “Five years ago, LNG couldn’t make up for Russian supplies being lower.”', 'At the same time, the U.S. oil industry is expected to up production for a tight oil market by an estimated 900,000 barrels a day this year, Yergin said. The industry currently produces about 11.6 million barrels a day and could be back to prepandemic levels of 13 million barrels a day by next year.', 'Evidence of the oil industry’s expanding production is showing up in an increase in rigs. According to Baker Hughes, oil industry rigs now total 516, up 19 rigs last week — the biggest gain in four years.', '“I think the Ukraine crisis has solidified the oil gold rush for all the companies involved, now including the majors like Continental Resources, which just announced a doubling of their spending relative to their output,” Again Capital partner John Kilduff said. “Continental is really doubling down on more production. They’re willing to accept the higher costs for now to get more oil out of the ground over the near and medium term.”', 'The U.S. is a big producer, but Russia is a bigger supplier of world markets, exporting about 5 million barrels a day. If there were an invasion, any loss of Russian oil would be felt globally.', 'Russia and its partners in OPEC+ have slowly been lifting production as demand returns from pandemic levels, and they should reach their goal by summer. But the Russian government has long been wary of oil prices getting too high, since the higher they go, the more incentive there is for U.S. producers to increase production.', 'If Russian crude exports were reduced, analysts expect Moscow’s OPEC+ partner Saudi Arabia would turn on it spigots. The Middle Eastern country has spare capacity to pump oil that the U.S. does not have, and U.S. companies would need to drill new wells to generate much more oil.', 'Kilduff said the U.S. industry, however, is likely to see a surprising surge in oil production soon, since companies have been opening wells that had been drilled but uncompleted.', 'Analysts have said it’s the incremental production from the U.S. and other non OPEC countries, like Brazil, that have been keeping oil prices from shooting sharply higher. But now U.S. producers could be put to the test, even if the Ukraine tensions subside.', 'Dan Pickering, chief investment officer of Pickering Energy Partners, said U.S. oil production has been increasing, but U.S. companies are still not drilling full speed ahead because of pressure from shareholders. Companies have been paying down debt, raising dividends and looking for ways to reduce their carbon output, under scrutiny from ESG [environmental, social, governance] investors.', 'Pickering said that, though relatively small, the jump in the rig count is important. “To me it’s a reflection that oil prices are strong. That small incremental on the margin could be a confluence of a number of things,” he said. “You don’t have a frenzy going on to add activity right now. We have guys out in the Permian right now doing meetings. It’s busy, but not a frenzy. We’ve seen frenzies. It feels pretty good in Midland. It doesn’t feel frenetic.”', 'He expects if the industry does move to increase drilling, the evidence of its efforts would come over the next year, not in the near future. But he noted that Exxon Mobil said it would boost its production in the Permian basin in Texas by 25% this year, and Chevron plans to up its output there by 10%.', '“Let’s assume Russia doesn’t invade. Let’s say oil goes to $82. That’s still a damn good number. The real reinvigoration of this business is when there are no external influences and prices are still good,” he said. “These guys are going to take baby steps for a while unless really pushed.”', 'Pickering said oil futures suggest oil will be around $68 per barrel five years from now, a good but not great price like $90 would be.', '“So the industry has more of a spring in its step. Remember they almost died in 2020. A lot of them did die and went into bankruptcy,” he said. “Things are getting better. People don’t trust it that much, and if you end up with a situation where a geopolitical event spikes oil prices, that’s just going to reinforce this is a tight market. That’s the kind of thing that boosts the industry’s confidence level, even if they don’t necessarily react to that kind of event.”', 'According to IHS, private companies have been boosting production, and they typically account for 20% of increased volume, but this year that number will be 50%.', 'Kilduff noted that Devon Energy announced in its earnings release Tuesday higher-than-expected production, another sign that the industry is increasing output. The company beat earnings expectations and also kept its focus on shareholders, hiking its dividend. Devon shares were up more than 6% on Wednesday.', '“After taking these companies to the wood shed for the past couple of years for for the low price environment, all of a sudden the economics make sense again, and that’s getting them back to their old habits,” Kilduff said.', '— CNBC’s Pippa Stevens contributed to this story.']"

With ongoing uncertainty over how oil supplies could be affected by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, consumers are likely to continue to see elevated prices when they fill up their tank.', '“This is an extremely fluid and volatile situation,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. “It’s going to be a bumpy road.”', 'Oil prices spiked Thursday on the heels of Russia invading Ukraine. U.S. crude, for instance, surged above the $100-a-barrel mark before settling around $92, after President Joe Biden said there currently are no plans for economic sanctions to target Russia’s exports of oil and gas.

Crude accounts for roughly half the price of gas at the pump.', 'If the conflict in Ukraine were to intensify, it’s unclear how the situation will unfold.

In other words, don’t do things like speed or race from stoplight to stoplight. You also can aim to make your fill-ups stretch farther by combining trips.', 'Also, be sure to shop around for the best price. Depending on where you live, there can be big price swings among gas stations.', 'Even if the difference in price per gallon may not be much, it can still add up to hundreds of dollars per year.

And some stations may offer a discount if you pay with cash.', 'What’s more, cost-conscious motorists use apps — including GasBuddy, Gas Guru and AAA TripTik — that can help find the best prices along their route. ', 'It’s also worth looking into loyalty programs, which many major gas station chains offer. They generally are free to join and often include cents-per-gallon discounts on purchases, De Haan said.', 'However, credit cards that offer discounts for gas purchases might not be the best option unless you routinely pay off the card’s balance. In other words, if you use such a card, you could end up paying more in interest than the discount itself.']"
