Research group Markit said the final reading of its manufacturing purchasing managers’ index came in at 52.0, revised up from the preliminary reading of 51.9 but below March's 10-month high of 52.2.

The ECB launched a trillion-euro stimulus program in March and recent economic reports indicated that the recovery in the region was already gaining traction as a result.
The euro was also lower against the yen and the pound, with EUR/JPY down 0.48% to 133.9 and EUR/GBP losing 0.39% to trade at 0.7360.

The dollar had received a boost after a report on Thursday showed that the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell to a 15-year low of 262,000, pointing to healthy growth in the labor market.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was last up 0.53% to 95.38 late Friday, after falling to two-month lows of 94.47 on Thursday.
Data earlier in the week showed that the U.S. economy grew just 0.2% in the three months to March, slowing from 2.2% in the final quarter of 2014. It was the slowest rate of growth in a year.
The weaker-than-expected data prompted investors to push back expectations on the timing of an initial rate hike by the Federal Reserve to later this year from midyear.
In its rate statement on Wednesday the Federal Reserve said recent indications of a slowdown in growth were probably due to “transitory factors.”

15,By Investing.com,"<span>May 01, 2015 05:58PM ET</span>","EUR/USD falls slightly, halting extended rally on thinly traded May Day","Investing.com -- The U.S. dollar halted an extended slump against the euro on Friday, posting slight gains in a thinly traded session limited by market closures on a three-day weekend.
EUR/USD fell below 1.12 in U.S. afternoon trading, before settling at 1.199 – down 0.23%. Although the dollar snapped a four-session losing streak against the euro, it is still down several percentage points from its level on April 21 when it peaked at 1.0658. The pair had been in a holding pattern at levels between 1.05-1.10 since early-March before the euro's rally over the last two weeks.
The majority of markets in Asia, including China were closed on Friday for the May Day holiday. Most markets were closed in Europe, as well with the exception of London.
Currency traders hoping for an indication on the timing of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve earlier in the week, received few clues from a guarded Federal Open Market Committee in an ambiguous rate statement. While a relatively dovish Fed removed all calendar references on a potential rate hike from its monetary policy, it still has not ruled out June for a lift-off date. On Friday, Federal Reserve of Cleveland president Loretta Mester said June is still ""on the table"" for a rate increase.
U.S. Consumer Sentiment rose slightly for April, as the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Index gained several points to 95.9, up from a reading of 93.0 in March. The current reading was unchanged from the preliminary reading for the month, but below analysts' forecasts of 96.0. The survey's sub index on current condition increased modestly to 107, up from a prior reading of 105.
Construction spending nationwide, however, dipped by 0.6% in March – below expectations of a 0.4% gain. Markit's PMI manufacturing flash index also fell to 54.1, down from 55.7 in March. The index was pushed down by weakness in U.S. exports, which contracted for the first time since November. The Institute for Supply Management, meanwhile, said its national factory activity index was at 51.5 for April, remaining unchanged from a month earlier.
Elsewhere, negotiations regarding Greece's sovereign debt crisis between prime minister Alexis Tsipras and a group of creditors known as the Brussels Group are scheduled to last throughout the weekend. On Wednesday, Moody's cut Greece's government bond rating from Caa1 to Caa2, amid concerns that the troubled nation will not strike a deal in time with its troika of creditors – the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and the European Commission. 
Yields on 10-year Greek bonds ended the week at 10.23%, while yields on 10-year German bunds closed at 0.37%. In March, the bid/offer spread on German bunds increased to six basis points – the widest level in three years. Meanwhile, yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries gained 0.068 to 2.112%."

USD/JPY fell slightly in U.S. afternoon trading to YEN 118.89 roughly an hour after the start of the joint news conference at the Rose Garden on the steps of the White House. Earlier, the dollar moved above 119 to a session-high of 119.20, before falling to a near daily-low of 118.81 minutes before the beginning of the press conference.
The pair is down more than 1% over the last two weeks when it reached 120.12 on April 13.
In July, 2013, Japan became the 12th nation to join negotiations of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a free trade agreement involving the United States, Japan, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam. The United States and its TPP partners envision the agreement as “a comprehensive, next-generation regional agreement that liberalizes trade and investment and addresses new and traditional trade issues and 21st century challenges.”
While a large percentage of U.S. businesses reportedly welcome Japan's participation in the pact, the trade agreement has been met with resistance by the U.S. auto industry and the United Auto Workers union. A cap on the amount of rice the U.S. can sell to Japan without encountering a tariff could be another sticking point in the negotiations.
One day before Abe will become the first Japanese prime minister to address a Joint Session of Congress, Abe said significant progress has been made in negotiations.
""We will continue to cooperate to lead the TPP talks through its last phase,"" Abe said. ""We have confirmed that we will work together for the earliest, successful completion of the talks.""
Responding to a question on whether reaching a trade deal is important to curtail the influence of China militarily and economically, Obama said the deal is ""good for American workers regardless of what China is doing."" Obama previously indicated that a deal would be necessary for restraining China's influence.
""We believe the case on the merits as to why it will open up markets for American goods, American exports and create American jobs,"" Obama said. ""This is not simply a defensive agreement this is something that will be part of our economic agenda moving forward.""
The yen has stabilized somewhat against the dollar after hitting an eight-year low at 121.47, as the aftershocks of a Japanese sales-tax hike last spring continued to be felt.

AUD/USD hit 0.7882 during late Asian trade, the pair's highest since March 26; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.7875, rising 0.23%.
The pair was likely to find support at 0.7789, Monday's low and resistance at 0.7940, the high of March 24.
RBA Governor Glenn Stevens said earlier that he had ""no comments to offer on monetary policy ahead of next week's meeting of the Reserve Bank Board.""
Stevens did signal however that the RBA is now viewing the risks to the economy that stem from low interest rates.
Meanwhile, the greenback remained under pressure after the Commerce Department reported Friday that orders for durable goods, excluding aircraft, fell 0.5% in March, after a downwardly revised 2.2% drop in February.
The headline figure rose 4.0%, beating expectations for a 0.6% gain, but investors focused on underlying weakness in the report.
The data came after recent weak reports on home sales, retail sales and industrial production, adding to signs of a slowdown in economic growth since the start of the year.
The weak data led investors to push back expectations on the timing of an initial rate hike by the Fed.
The Aussie was also higher against the euro, with EUR/AUD sliding 0.35% to 1.3812.

EUR/USD was at 1.0883, not far from Monday’s three-week peaks of 1.0926.

Traders were looking ahead to the S&P/Case Shiller housing index and a report on U.S. consumer confidence later in the day for further indications on the strength of the recovery, ahead of Wednesday’s Federal Reserve policy announcement.
Recent disappointing data on employment, home sales and industrial production have prompted investors to scale back expectations on the timing of a first rate hike by the U.S. central bank, sending the dollar lower.

52,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 27, 2015 06:56PM ET</span>","EUR/USD extends rally, as Greece reshuffles its negotiating team","Investing.com -- The euro extended its rally against the dollar on Monday to reach its highest level in three weeks, after a conciliatory move by Greece to ease tensions with its euro zone creditors provided a glimmer of hope for a breakthrough in the strained negotiations.
EUR/USD gained more than 0.1% to 1.096 in U.S. afternoon trading before falling back slightly to 1.0885 at the close. The euro is up more than 2% against its American counterpart since falling to 1.0737 on April 20.
Looking to rebound from a disastrous meeting with euro group ministers on Friday, Greece handed the day-to-day duties of working with the creditors to Euclid Tsakalotos, replacing Yanis Varoufakis with the Deputy Foreign Minister. Varoufakis will still be in charge of Greek negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, a Greek government official told reporters in an e-mail.
On Friday, euro zone ministers flung insults at the beleaguered Greek Finance Minister, accusing him of stalling progress in the talks. Greece has failed to unlock critical aid needed to stave off bankruptcy in spite of three months of negotiations with its euro zone creditors.
The move came after more than half of the respondents in a survey of money market traders by Reuters think there's a chance that Greece could remain in the euro zone even if it defaults on its sovereign debt. The price of Greek 2-Year bonds shot up, as yields on Monday fell by nearly 300 basis points to 23%.
In the U.S., economists are bracing for paltry first quarter GDP growth when the U.S. Department of Commerce releases its figures on Wednesday. Analysts from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) are projecting growth of 1.1%, far below a 2.2% increase at the end of 2014. The Federal Reserve of Atlanta is predicting an even bleaker outlook with its forecast of 0.2% growth.
In addition, the Federal Reserve is expected to keep its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at its current level of zero to 0.25% following the conclusion of the two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday.
When the Fed released the minutes from its March meeting earlier this month, the committee ruled that an increase in the target range for the rate remained ""unlikely at the April meeting."" The FOMC appears uncertain on the timing of its first interest rate hike since 2009, amid a possible growing divide between Fed governors on a date for lift-off.
Although the Fed has not ruled out lift-off in June, analysts increasingly believe that a rate hike will not occur until the fall. The CME Group (NASDAQ:CME), for instance, isn't pricing a rate hike in its models until October.

The Commerce Department reported Friday that orders for durable goods, excluding aircraft, fell 0.5% in March, after a downwardly revised 2.2% drop in February.
The headline figure rose 4.0%, beating expectations for a 0.6% gain, but investors focused on underlying weakness in the report.
The data came after recent weak reports on home sales, retail sales and industrial production, adding to signs of a slowdown in economic growth since the start of the year.

The dollar was also lower against the yen, with USD/JPY down 0.51% to one-week lows of 118.98.
Sterling also pushed higher against the weaker dollar, with GBP/USD adding 0.88% to trade at 1.5188 late Friday. The pound shrugged off uncertainty over the outcome next month’s U.K. general elections.
In the week ahead investors will be looking to Wednesday’s Fed statement for clues on the possible timing of a rate increase. Investors will also be focusing on Wednesday’s preliminary reading on U.S. first quarter growth as well as reports on inflation, consumer confidence and manufacturing.

86,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2015 11:00PM ET</span>",Trade bill key to Pacific pact clears Senate panel,"By Krista Hughes
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Legislation to give the White House ""fast track"" authority to nail down a Pacific trade pact cleared its first hurdle in the U.S. Congress on Wednesday as a committee backed the bill and sent it to the full Senate for consideration.
Approved by the Senate Finance Committee on a 20 to 6 vote, the legislation would prohibit Congress from amending trade deals, instead allowing for just up-or-down votes.
It is vital to closing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement that would link a dozen economies and cover a third of global trade. TPP is central to President Barack Obama's strategic shift toward Asia.
Fast-track authority could now go to the full Senate for a vote as early as next week, just as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is due in Washington to address lawmakers at a joint meeting of Congress, but it needs to be approved by the House of Representatives as well.
On Tuesday, Japan's top trade negotiator sounded an optimistic note on reaching a deal with the United States.
""Tonight's Committee action marks a pivotal moment for international trade policy and reflects years of true bipartisan work,"" said committee chairman Orrin Hatch, a Republican.
After lively debate in the committee, senators rejected an amendment that would have exposed nations that manipulate their currencies to sanctions, although it could be resurrected in the House of Representatives. Japan has warned that tough currency provisions in fast-track could kill the TPP.
The panel instead backed two other provisions beefing up rules against currency manipulation in a separate bill accompanying the fast-track legislation.
Senators defied warnings from the Obama administration and backed a change opening the door to import duties against countries found to be manipulating their currencies.
The other provision, supported by the administration, would allow the United States to consider restricting government purchases from currency-cheating nations or even block them from future trade deals.
The bill was approved along with measures to extend both trade preferences for African nations and aid to workers who lose their jobs due to trade.
Many Democrats fear new trade deals will cause a repeat of the factory closures and job losses seen after the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico was approved in 1993.
Democratic senator Bob Casey, who voted against the bill, said it was a ""fast track to fewer jobs and lower wages.""
But the bill is backed by mainstream Republicans, farmers and business groups who think trade deals in the pipeline will cut tariffs on U.S. exports and set higher standards for U.S. intellectual property.
The White House sees the TPP as a counterweight to China's influence in the Asia-Pacific and has warned that the Asian giant will set the rules for trade if the United States does not move ahead with the TPP, which is near completion.
TPP must pass Congress this year to avoid being bogged down in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. elections, where it could put Hillary Clinton, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president, in a difficult spot.
Clinton, who championed TPP as secretary of state under Obama, has been cautious in her stance. On Tuesday, she said any trade deal had to ""produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security.""

The bill will likely face a tougher fight in the House of Representatives than the Senate, where Republicans would need to pick up only six Democratic votes to avoid delaying tactics, assuming there are no defections from the Republican side.

The euro slipped to 1.0733 in U.S. afternoon trading, down 0.0006 or 0.06%. EUR/USD fell to a daily-low of 1.0662 in European afternoon trading, before paring some of the losses during the remainder of the session. 
Since the start of March, EUR/USD has rarely moved outside of a range between 1.05 and 1.10. 
Currency traders await a key meeting of euro zone finance ministers in Latvia on Friday where Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras is expected to present a revised list of reform measures that could unlock a vital financial lifeline to the cash-strapped country. The effort could raise about €2 billion, according to multiple reports. 
On Tuesday, Jeroen Dijisselbloem, the head of the euro group of prominent finance ministers, steadfastly insisted that Greece must meet all of its obligations in the coming weeks if it wants to remain in the euro zone. In late-July, Greece owes a payment of €3.45 billion to the European Central Bank for bonds related to a 2012 default. First, Greece must meet three separate obligations to the International Monetary Fund totaling more than €1.0773 billion. 
""The money is starting to run out,"" Dijisselbloem told European broadcaster RTL. 
Dijisselbloem remained adamant that every effort must be undertaken to prevent a Greek exit from the euro zone, a move that has earned the popular moniker ""Grexit,"" in recent weeks. 
""If Greece leaves the euro zone you would get very dangerous instability,"" he added. ""It's in the interests of Greece and the euro zone as a whole to avoid that."" 
The sentiments were echoed on Tuesday by Jason Furman, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. It is commonly thought by a number of economists that a Greek departure from the euro zone could have a contagion effect, impacting countries such as Spain, Italy and Portugal whose yields on its government debt have slipped into negative territory. 
""A Greek exit would not just be bad for the Greek economy, it would be taking a very large and unnecessary risk with the global economy just when a lot of things are starting to go right,"" Furman said in an interview with Reuters. 
Also on Tuesday, German 10-Year bunds rose 0.03 to 0.10, even as prominent bond trader Bill Gross declared a short sale on the bund, ""the short of a lifetime."" Gross does not expect European Central Bank president Mario Draghi to continue to buy the 10-year German bunds if the yields drop too far into negative territory. 
""The valuation is such that these German bunds, the nine-year, 10-years basically yield nothing,"" Gross told CNBC. ""There is a minus 20 basis point barrier through which Draghi will not continue to buy. It has a downside of 10 or 15 points, so it's just a question of when. It's certainly a trade that doesn't cost you anything."" 
Yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries, meanwhile, inched up 0.014 to 1.911%. 
Elsewhere, the ZEW Centre for Economic Research said its index of German economic sentiment dropped to 53.3 from 54.8 in March. Economists had expected a reading of 55.3.

Officials in Athens on Monday reportedly issued a decree to local governments forcing them to transfer all cash balances to the Greek Central Bank, in advance of a €770 million obligation due to the International Monetary Fund in May. The effort could raise about €2 billion, according to multiple reports.
The report came in the wake of a renewed effort by European Central Bank president Mario Draghi over the weekend to soothe tensions with Greece. Speaking at a conference in Washington on Saturday involving the world's top finance ministers, Draghi rejected speculation that Greece may be forced to abandon the euro. Last week, the Financial Times reported that Greece could be exploring a contingency plan on how to proceed if it fails to receive critical aid from its euro zone creditors, which is deemed necessary for it to stave off bankruptcy. Officials in Athens promptly denied the report.
Elsewhere, comments from monetary policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic had little impact on the currency pair. In Frankfurt, Draghi appeared optimistic on the early stages of the ECB's €1.1 trillion quantitative easing program in remarks published on Monday. After a review of a swath of policy measures and balance sheets of member banks, Draghi said, ""growth projections as well as inflation expectations have been revised upward and confidence overall has been increased."" The remarks were published in the Introduction to the ECB's annual report.

122,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 20, 2015 02:41AM ET</span>",Forex - NZD/USD rises close to 3-month highs despite N.Z. data,"Investing.com - The New Zealand dollar rose against its U.S. counterpart on Monday, to trade close to three-month highs even after disappointing inflation data from New Zealand, as demand for the greenback remained broadly under pressure.
NZD/USD hit 0.7724 during late Asian trade, the session high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.7720, gaining 0.43%.
The pair was likely to find support at 0.7642, the low of April 17 and resistance at 0.7742, the high of April 17 and a three-month high.
Statistics New Zealand earlier reported that consumer prices slipped 0.3% in the first quarter, compared to expectations for a 0.2% downtick and after a 0.2% fall in the three months to December.
Year-over-year, New Zealand consumer prices rose 0.1% in the last quarter, confounding expectations for a 0.2% gain, after a 0.8% increase in the previous quarter.
Meanwhile, the greenback remained under pressure as investors pushed back expectations for higher U.S. interest rates after a recent string of soft economic data dampened optimism on the country's recovery.
The kiwi was also higher against the euro, with EUR/NZD declining 0.60% to 1.3982.

129,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 19, 2015 09:00AM ET</span>",Forex - USD/CAD weekly outlook: April 20 - 24,"Investing.com - The Canadian dollar turned lower against the U.S. dollar in choppy trade on Friday, after a run-up to four month highs on the back of higher oil prices and a brighter outlook from the Bank of Canada prompted investors to take profits.
USD/CAD hit lows of 1.2089, the weakest since January 21 before pulling back to 1.2246 in late trade. For the week, the pair was still down 2.61%.
The Canadian dollar was boosted by a rally in oil prices and a shift in the BoC’s outlook on the economy. Stronger-than-expected inflation data on Friday and a rebound in retail sales also boosted the loonie.
Oil prices have been well-supported in recent sessions due to mounting expectations that U.S. shale oil production has peaked and may start falling in the coming months. 
Canada is a major energy exporter and the currency’s value rises and falls along with the price of oil.
The loonie hit session highs after Statistics Canada said Friday that the annual rate of inflation ticked up to 1.2% in March from 1.0% the previous month. Economist had expected an unchanged reading. 
Consumer prices were up 0.7% from a month earlier, ahead of forecasts for a 0.5% increase.
At the same time, data showed that retail sales rebounded 1.7% in February, after a 1.4% drop in the previous month.
The reports came one day after the BoC held its overnight cash rate at 0.75%, indicating that January’s rate cut has been sufficient to offset the negative impact of lower oil prices.The bank said it expects economic growth to have stalled in the first quarter of 2015 as a result of the oil price shock, but expects growth to rebound in the second quarter and subsequently strengthen on a quarterly basis.
The central bank surprised markets with an unexpected rate cut in January, which Governor Stephen Poloz described as “insurance” against the effects of lower oil prices.
The greenback remained broadly lower after data showing an uptick in U.S. consumer prices failed to offset concerns that recent signs of economic weakness could prompt a delay in interest rate hikes.
The Labor Department reported that the consumer price index edged up 0.2% last month, matching a similar gain in February. On a year-over-year basis, consumer prices dipped 0.1% in March after remaining flat in February.
Core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy costs increased 0.2% in March for an annual increase of 1.8%, the largest since October.

132,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 17, 2015 05:26PM ET</span>",The euro extends rally against dollar to end week roughly 2% higher,"Investing.com -- The euro capped the week by extending its rally against the dollar, as stronger than expected U.S. consumer data and concerns related to the Greek debt crisis remained in focus.
EUR/USD gained 0.0046 or 0.49% to 1.0811 in U.S. afternoon trading. Earlier in European trading, the pair reached 1.0849, its highest level since April 8, before wavering throughout a choppy session. For the week, the euro increased by roughly 2% against its U.S. counterpart. Since the start of March, the pair has rarely been outside of a range of 1.05 to 1.10.
The dollar pared earlier losses in U.S. morning trading following the release of stronger than expected consumer data. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in its monthly report said its Consumer Price Index rose 0.2% for March, slightly below forecasts of a 0.3% increase. A closer reading indicated that prices swung upward in medical care, used car and truck sales and household furnishing, while airlines fares declined for the fourth time and five months.
Soon after, the University of Michigan said its Consumer Sentiment index for the middle of April ticked up to 95.9, up from 93.0 at the end of March. The index reached an eight-year high in January at 98.1 before declining a month later.
Despite the strong indicators, there were still signs of sluggish growth throughout the economy within the report. Low levels for energy prices led to a downward revision in inflation expectations to 2.5% for the remainder of the year, down from an earlier projection of 3.0. The modest inflation expectations may increase the risk that consumers will curb spending while awaiting lower prices.
In addition, the subdued inflation expectations may also fuel speculation that the Federal Reserve could wait until the fall before it decides to raise interest rates.
On Thursday, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta president Dennis Lockhart provided little indication that the Fed could institute a highly-anticipated interest-rate hike in June. The Fed is taking a data-driven approach to the timing of its first rate hike in more than five years, as it awaits increases in wage and GDP growth, as well as steady rises in inflation before it raises its benchmark Fed Funds rate.
""The data available for the first quarter of this year have been notably weak…giving rise to heightened uncertainty about the track the economy is on,"" Lockhart said during a speech in St. Petersburg, Fla.
Elsewhere, Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi attempted to assuage fears of a Greek default on its sovereign debt with reassuring comments in Washington. Speaking at a joint press conference with U.S. president Barack Obama at the White House, Renzi indicated that the euro zone is better prepared to react to a possible departure by Greece from the EU than it was during other economic crises over the last decade.
""The situation in Greece is not the same situation as 2011, its not the same as 2008,"" Renzi said. ""We must absolutely achieve an agreement.""
Renzi's comments came two days after German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble warned that practically no one expects Greece to make a series of key repayments at a critical meeting of euro zone finance ministers next week in Latvia or anytime in the near future. Athens officials have also denied a report from the Financial Times that it approached the International Monetary Fund to request a delay on a loan payment due later next month.
Stocks on equities markets on both sides of the Atlantic plunged, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, The Stoxx Europe 600 index and the German Dax index all fell by more than 1% on the session. In Europe, investors sought safety in government bonds as yields on German 10-Year bunds fell to a record-low at 0.051% before rebounding slightly to 0.08%. A plethora of government bonds in Europe have turned negative since the European Central Bank launched an ambitious quantitative easing program last month.
While the €60 billion a month bond buying program has been responsible for a steady depreciation in the euro over the last several weeks, French finance minister Michel Sapin indicated on Friday that it could be unwise to allow it to fall any lower.
“I think that if we had wanted, or gave the impression that we wanted, to go further in the decline in the value of the euro we would be entering a dangerous zone,” Sapin said during an appearance at the International Monetary Fund.
The euro is still down roughly 10% against the dollar this year.

EUR/USD moved up modestly to 1.0766 in U.S. afternoon trading, one day after it reached 1.0686 to halt a steady depreciation against the greenback. The pair rose throughout the session from a 1.0699 level in European afternoon trading. 
The pair likely received support at 1.05 its low from Mar. 11 and resistance at 1.10 the high from April 3. Since the start of March, EUR/USD has rarely hovered outside that range. 
The U.S. Department of Labor said individuals filing for jobless benefits for the week ending April 11, increased by 12,000 to 294,000. Analysts had forecasted a decline of 2,000 for the week. 
A disappointing reading of the Philadlephia Fed Business Outlook Survey paints a similarly dire picture. While the index ticked up to 7.5, from 5.0 in March, it obscures a 0.7 reading in new orders – the lowest growth in almost two years. This comes after the release of discouraging figures from Wednesday's release of the Empire State Manufacturing Survey. For the month, the survey ticked down 1.19 producing only the second negative reading in the last 23 months. 
In terms of housing data, starts last month rose 2.0% to 926,000, vastly below expectations of a 15.9% increase. Building permits, meanwhile, declined by 5.7% to 1.039 million for the month. Analysts had expected the number of permits to drop by 2.0% to 1.08 million nationwide.

The news pushed yields on 10-Year U.S. Treasuries above 1.91% in afternoon trading, before they fell back slightly to 1.895. 
In Europe, yields on 10-Year German bundsfell to a record-low at 0.073%, one day after Mario Draghi reaffirmed the European Central Bank's long-term commitment to its €1.1 trillion quantitative easing program. The ECB announced earlier this week that it purchased €52.5 billion in government bonds in the first month of the program, including more than €11 billion in Germany. 
The gains in the euro against its American counterpart were softened by increased concerns that Greece could default on its sovereign debt and leave the euro zone.

156,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 15, 2015 05:45PM ET</span>","EUR/USD edges up amid optimistic ECB outlook, poor U.S. manufacturing ","Investing.com -- The euro posted mild gains against the dollar on Wednesday, amid a favorable outlook of quantitative easing by the European Central Bank and weak U.S. manufacturing data.
EUR/USD was up 0.0030 or 0.28% to 1.0686 in U.S. afternoon trading to pare earlier losses. The pair dipped to a daily-low of 1.0572 ahead of ECB president Mario Draghi's press conference in European afternoon trading. The euro edged up throughout the session trading flat against the dollar hours later before approaching near 1.07 levels in U.S. afternoon trading.
The pair likely received support at 1.05 its low from Mar. 11 and resistance at 1.10 the high from April 3. Since the start of March, EUR/USD has rarely hovered outside that range.
Draghi appeared confident about the early success of the ECB's 60 billion a month quantitative easing program that launched last month and is scheduled to run through September, 2016. Draghi said the easing initiative has helped spur gradual economic recovery in the area, before adding that the ECB has had no problems meeting its targeted goal of purchasing government bonds. The ECB also left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.05.
The ECB has raised the possibility that it could end the bond buying program sooner than expected if inflation in the euro zone moves toward its targeted goal of 2%. Heading into Wednesday's meeting, Slovenian central banker Bostjan Jazbec indicated that the ECB could slow the pace of easing if it approached its goal of lifting the euro zone out of deflation.
""I am quite surprised at the attention of a possible early exit,"" Draghi said. ""It is like asking yourself after 1K, when are we going to finish the marathon.""
For the month of March, the ECB reported that it purchased €52.5 in government bonds, including more than 11 billion from Germany. The purchases also included €8.75 of French bonds, as well as €7.6 billion of government bonds from Italy.
The strong demand from the central bank has pushed a wave of 2-year government bonds into negative territory. Of a sampling of 10 major nations in the euro zone, only 2-year bonds in Italy and Spain remain positive. Yields on 2-year bonds in Germany, Netherlands and Finland have all dipped under -0.2%.
In Germany, yields have turned negative on government bonds heading into 2024. The Germany 10-Year fell 0.03 to 0.11, two days after touching a record-low. 
In the U.S., meanwhile, industrial production last month fell 0.6%, after a rise of 0.1% in February. Separately, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey ticked down 1.19 for March producing only the second negative reading in the last 23 months.
The Federal Reserve in its release of its Beige Book on Wednesday blamed the weak manufacturing data on the relative strength of the dollar, a sharp drop in crude oil prices and harsher than normal Winter conditions. The stronger dollar, in particular, was responsible for a reduction in chemical exports in the Dallas region and manufacturing weaknesses in four districts, according to the Fed.

USD/CAD hit lows of 1.2434 and was last at 1.2438, down from around 1.2538 ahead of the announcement.
The BoC held its overnight cash rate at 0.75%, in line with expectations.
""Risks to the outlook for inflation are now roughly balanced and risks to financial stability appear to be evolving as expected,"" the bank said in a statement.
The central bank surprised markets with an unexpected rate cut in January, which Governor Stephen Poloz described as “insurance” against the effects of lower oil prices.
The bank said it expects economic growth to have stalled in the first quarter of 2015 as a result of the oil price shock, but expects growth to rebound in the second quarter and subsequently strengthen on a quarterly basis.
The bank also said the very weak first quarter has led to a widening of Canada’s output gap and additional downward pressure on projected inflation.
However it expects the effect on underlying inflation from the weaker dollar to offset the output gap as the economy recovers.
In the U.S., data on Wednesday showed that manufacturing activity in New York State fell unexpectedly this month, while industrial production saw the largest drop in two-and-a-half years.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said the Empire State manufacturing activity index fell to -1.19, from 6.90 in March. Economists had forecast an increase to 7.0.
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve said industrial production fell 0.6% in March, the largest fall since August 2012 and worse than economists' expectations for a 0.3% decline.
The reports, coming on the heels of Tuesday's disappointing retail sales data, added to speculation that the Federal Reserve could delay hiking interest rates until late 2015, instead of tightening midyear.
A separate report showed that U.S. home builder sentiment rose to the highest level of the year in April.
The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index increased to 56.0 from 52.0 in March and ahead of forecasts of 55.0.

Draghi played down speculation that recent signs of a recovery in the euro zone economy could see the bank curtail its bond buying program.
""Our focus will be on the full implementation of our policy measures,"" he said.
He said there is “clear evidence” that the policy measures are effective and added that borrowing conditions for firms and households have “improved notably”.

The ECB is monitoring inflation closely the ECB chief said, and it still expects inflation to rise back towards its target in 2016 and 2017.
Draghi also played down concerns that the asset purchase program will struggle to find enough euro zone bonds to buy.
The press conference was briefly disrupted by a protester shouting “end ECB dictatorship.”
The ECB maintained its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.05% earlier Wednesday, in line with market expectations. It kept its marginal lending at 0.30% and left its deposit facility rate unchanged at minus 0.20%.

169,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 14, 2015 01:33PM ET</span>","EUR/USD halts steady depreciation, amid Greek tension, mixed U.S. data","Investing.com -- The euro rallied against the dollar on Tuesday halting a steady depreciation, as a flurry of mixed economic data coincided with rising concerns of a potential default by Greece on its sovereign debt.
EUR/USD gained more than 1% in European afternoon trading to move above 1.07, before settling at 1.0669 in the U.S. afternoon session. Before Tuesday's rebound, the euro had declined more than 4% since Mar. 1, amid expectations of an imminent interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve.
A flurry of economic data released on Tuesday morning prompted a polarizing response from economists. U.S. retail sales for March rose 0.9% for the month, marking its first monthly increase since October. Strong gains in automobile, furniture and department store sales, led to the highest monthly increase since last March.
The data could be interpreted as bearish, however, since some economists forecasted a weather-related bounce of more than 1%, following a harsher than usual winter. A reading over 1% might have assuaged the concerns of those who were bearish on the economy following a weaker than expected jobs report in March.
At the same time, the U.S. Department of Labor's Producer Price Index rose 0.2% last month following a 0.5% decline in February. The increase is a strong harbinger for continued growth in the Consumer Price Index, the Labor Department's main indicator on inflation. The Fed is looking for inflation to move to its targeted goal of 2% before it decides on the timing of an interest rate hike.
Currency traders, on the whole, interpreted Tuesday's data as bearish, as the euro rallied and yields on U.S. Treasuries plunged following the release of the reports. During U.S. afternoon trading, yields on the U.S. 2-Year, the U.S. 10-Year and the U.S. 30-Year were all down more than 2.95%.
Elsewhere, the International Monetary Fund trimmed its forecast for GDP growth in the U.S. for 2015 from 3.6% to 3.1%, while increasing estimates of GDP growth in the euro zone from 1.2 to 1.5%.
""The U.S. economy is actually in fairly good shape. The fundamentals are good, the banks are in decent shape, the corporations have cash and households have decreased debt,"" IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard told CNBC. ""In all the margins it looks like the elements for sustained growth are there.""
In spite of the euro's steady depreciation against the dollar since the start of the year, Blanchard did not seem overly concerned.
""It's probably going to put a brake on U.S. recovery but the Fed can adjust by increasing rates if the effects of appreciation are negative,"" Blanchard added. ""We're not historically at extreme levels. If it were to continue a lot, some would worry but we're very far from that.""
Tension between Greece and its euro zone creditors continued to remain high on Tuesday. Hours after the Financial Times reported that Greece is formulating a plan on how to respond from a possible default on its debt, officials from Athens denied the report and shot down speculation of a new election that would effectively unseat the Syriza government.

179,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 14, 2015 02:45AM ET</span>","Singapore Surprises By Standing Pat On Policy, Local Dollar Climbs","By Reuters -

(Reuters) - Singapore's central bank on Tuesday surprised markets by holding off from further monetary easing, saying an improving outlook for global growth would underpin the trade-reliant economy.
The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said the city-state's economy was on track to meet the official forecast of 2-4 percent growth in 2015, and kept its projections for headline and core inflation unchanged.
""The outlook for the global economy has improved slightly, anchored by a stronger recovery in the G3,"" the MAS said in its half-yearly policy statement.
The central bank kept the slope, width and mid-point of the Singapore dollar's policy band unchanged and said it would maintain its policy of a ""modest and gradual"" appreciation of the Singapore dollar.
In January, the MAS had unexpectedly reduced the slope of its policy band for the Singapore dollar in an off-cycle move, saying the inflation outlook had ""shifted significantly"" following a plunge in global oil prices.
Analysts say the central bank appears comfortable with domestic growth and inflation trends even though the global outlook hasn't changed significantly since January.
""In their assessment of the global outlook, they seem to be a bit more optimistic than we are,"" said Chua Hak Bin, head of emerging Asia economics for Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), adding slowdowns in China and Malaysia pose risks.
Indeed, the MAS seems to be taking a glass half-full stance on the economy, preferring a measured policy approach even as many global central banks have unleashed a wave of aggressive easings to boost growth and inflation.
Citing slowing growth and benign headline inflation, a majority of 25 analysts polled by Reuters had been expecting the MAS to ease policy on Tuesday. Some, including Chua, still see risks of an easing at the next policy review in October.
The MAS manages monetary policy by letting the Singapore dollar rise or fall against the currencies of its main trading partners within an undisclosed trading band based on its nominal effective exchange rate (NEER).
GDP TOPS FORECAST
An estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product released on Tuesday showed that Singapore's economy grew an annualized 1.1 percent in January-March from the prior quarter, above expectations for 0.5 percent growth.
The Singapore dollar rallied after the surprise MAS decision, and was last at 1.3640 versus the U.S. dollar, up 0.5 percent on the day.
For the year, the Singapore dollar is still down about 2.8 percent against its U.S. counterpart, but has stabilized over recent weeks due to cooling expectations of an imminent U.S. interest rate rise."

The pair likely received support at 1.05 its low from Mar. 11 and resistance at 1.10 the high from April 3. 
Analysts, investors and policymakers are closely monitoring a number of critical economic indicators over the next few days, following the release of several figures last week that could mostly be construed as disappointing. Economists expect a slight uptick of 1.1% in this week's U.S. Retail Sales Report, as well as a modest increase in the Producer Price Index, both of which are being released on Tuesday. 
Analysts, however, have forecasted a 0.3% decline in industrial production from last month and are bracing for a decline in housing starts for March, after the figure dropped sharply by 17% a month earlier. Policymakers also await the release of the Consumer Price Index for the month of March on Friday for a gauge on inflation. 
Last month, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen indicated that she would like to see inflation move toward its target goal of 2% before the Fed decides on the timing of its first interest-rate hike in more than five years. The index rebounded 0.2% in February, after declining sharply by 0.7% a month earlier.

The soft data sparked concerns over the outlook for first quarter U.K. growth.

201,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 11, 2015 04:12AM ET</span>","EUR/USD moves back toward parity, ending the week down more than 3%","Investing.com -- The U.S. dollar resumed its steady ascent against the euro on Friday, amid optimistic economic data as the pair continued its move back toward parity.
EUR/USD dove 0.0059 or 0.55% to slip under 1.06 at 1.059 – its lowest level since Mar. 18. On that date, the pair gained more than 2% after relatively dovish comments from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen on slow GDP and wage growth fueled speculation that a looming interest-rate hike could be delayed.
EUR/USD plunged to a daily-low of 1.0568 in European afternoon trading before paring some of its losses during the U.S. morning trading session.
The pair likely gained support at 1.05, the low on Mar. 13 and resistance at $1.12, the high from Mar. 2. Earlier this week, the euro moved above 1.10 against the dollar for the first time since Mar. 25 following a disappointing U.S. monthly jobs report for the month of March.
It has declined sharply since then and finished the week down more than 3.4% down against its U.S. counterpart. For the year as a whole, the pair is down roughly 12% as the start of a €60 million a month quantitative easing program coincided with expectations that the Fed appeared ready to raise rates.
Although Yellen's comments last month may have slowed the dollar's appreciation, many analysts believe that parity is inevitable. Last month, analysts from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said they expect the euro to reach $0.95 against the dollar by March, 2016 and to continue downward to $0.80 by the end of 2017.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said on Friday that U.S. import prices fell 0.3% in March, marking the eighth consecutive monthly decline. More critically, prices for domestic imports fell 10.5% on a year-over-year basis from March, 2014, representing the steepest decline since 2009.
A stronger dollar is considered to be a key factor in pulling down import prices. The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, ticked upward 0.43% on Friday to 99.68. The index is approximately 20% higher since last year at this time.
Next week, investors will await the release of the BLS' Consumer Price Index for the month of February on Friday. In January, the CPI-U for All Urban Consumers fell by 0.7% on a seasonally-adjusted basis and 0.1% over the last year, marking the first 12-month negative change since October, 2009. The CPI is the most widely used monthly indicator of inflation. Other key reports on U.S manufacturing and industrial production will be released early next week.
Also, the European Central Bank is expected to make key rate and monetary policy decisions at a Governing Council meeting on Wednesday. ECB president Mario Draghi is expected to make his first public comments on the euro zone's bond buying program at a press conference following the meeting.
Yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries fell slightly by 0.009 to 1.949, while yields on German 10-Year bunds ticked down 0.01 to 0.16.

(Reuters) - BlackRock sees opportunities to invest in emerging markets debt, despite the rising U.S. dollar and an expected increase in U.S. interest rates this year, executives said Thursday.
Given the amount of deleveraging in some emerging markets countries over the past several years, and the unpredictability of other markets, like the European credit market, investors should consider emerging markets debt, BlackRock's bond managers said at a breakfast roundtable Thursday morning in New York.
Traditionally when the Fed moves, the thinking is that investors have to get out of emerging markets, but that is no longer true, said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of fundamental fixed income and co-head of Americas fixed-income at BlackRock.
""We think you can create opportunities in more stable parts of the world,"" Rieder said.
Specifically, BlackRock sees opportunities in India, Indonesia and Mexico, which it views as high-quality countries with strong balance sheets, said Amer Bisat, an emerging markets portfolio manager in BlackRock's fixed income group.
""We are happy to take on the interest rate risk in these local markets,"" he said.
The firm also sees opportunities in the sovereign credit of countries like Mexico, Indonesia as well as Slovenia, Bisat said.
Meanwhile, the firm is short or underweight Venezuela, Ukraine, South Africa and Turkey, which have deteriorating credit.
To be sure, emerging markets is facing an ""inhospitable environment,"" Bisat said.
Headwinds include collapsing commodity prices; a deterioration in global trade as more developed countries rely on emerging markets less; an increasing cost of capital and the rising value of the U.S. dollar, Bisat said.
The spread between emerging markets growth and developing markets growth has dropped from seven percent in the mid 2000s to two percent currently, he said.
But many emerging markets countries have stronger balance sheets than they have had in the past 30 years and are better equipped to deal with these challenges, Bisat said.
""There are buckets of value that are actually quite interesting,"" he said.
Still, the foreign exchange market as the U.S dollar rises in value will continue to be a headwind for emerging markets, Bisat said.
""We have so far continued to play the emerging markets FX for the short side,"" Bisat said.

EUR/USD fell to a session-low 1.0777 ahead of the release of the minutes in U.S. afternoon trading, before closing at 1.0798. On Monday, the currency pair moved above the 1.10 level for the first time since March 25.
The pair likely gained support at a low of 1.05 from March 11 and resistance at 1.11, the high from Mar. 4. 
Members of the Federal Open Market Committee appeared to be divided on whether to raise interest rates at its June meeting, the minutes show. Following weaker than expected GDP growth and a disappointing U.S. March jobs report, lift-off in September now appears more likely.
Despite the poor economic indicators, ""participants saw broad-based improvement in labor market conditions ... including strong gains in payroll employment ... While almost all participants noted potential risks to the economic outlook resulting from foreign economic and financial developments, most saw the risks to the outlook for economic growth and the labor market as nearly balanced,"" the minutes said.
The currency pair plunged more than 2% on Mar. 6 when a strong jobs report for the month of February increased speculation that rates could be increased sooner than previously expected. EUR/USD continued its freefall to 1.05 for the next few sessions until rebounding on Mar. 18 when relatively dovish comments from Fed chair Janet Yellen raised the possibility that the Fed could delay lift-off.
Over the last month, Yellen has indicated that the stronger dollar has weighed on U.S. exports.
Elsewhere, Russia president Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras did not ask for aid from Russia during his visit to Moscow this week. Putin's comments came amid speculation that Greece may have requested a stimulus package from Russia in exchange for helping convince the European Union to ease sanctions against Moscow.
Tsipras' visit took place ahead of a Thursday deadline for a EUR 468 million payment to the International Monetary Fund, stemming from its loan program started in 2010. On Sunday, IMF head Christine Lagarde said she was confident that Greece would make the payment in time.

The dollar slid against the other major currencies on Wednesday amid concerns that the U.S. economic recovery is cooling. Last Friday’s unexpectedly weak jobs report for March reinforced the view that the recovery is slowing, following a string of other soft economic reports.

253,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 06, 2015 11:00AM ET</span>",Forex - U.S. dollar broadly weaker after poor data,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar weakened broadly on Monday, as indications that the U.S. economy slowed in the first quarter fuelled bets the Federal Reserve will hold off on hiking interest rates until late 2015.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.3% to trade at 96.55.
The U.S. Institute of Supply Management said on Monday that its non-manufacturing purchasing manager's index slipped to 56.5 last month, in line with forecasts and down from a reading of 56.9 in February.
The report came after the Labor Department said Friday that the U.S. economy added 126,000 new jobs in March, the smallest increase since December 2013 and sharply below forecasts for a gain of 245,000.
The surprisingly weak data added to concerns over the outlook for economic growth after other recent economic reports pointed to a slowdown at the start of the year.
New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley said earlier that the timing of a future interest rate hike in the U.S. remains uncertain.
""The timing of normalization will be data dependent and remains uncertain because the future evolution of the economy cannot be fully anticipated,"" Dudley said in prepared remarks.
Meanwhile, the euro rose above the $1.10 level against the greenback, with EUR/USD hitting a session high of 1.1035 before pulling back slightly to trade at 1.1033, up 0.57%.
The single currency found further support from hopes that Greece will repay the International Monetary Fund on time. Athens is on the hook for a roughly €450 million loan repayment to the IMF due this Thursday.
Elsewhere, gold futures rallied sharply as investors increased bets the Federal Reserve will hold off on raising interest rates until later this year following the release of disappointing U.S. employment data.
A delay in raising interest rates would be seen as bullish for gold, as it decreases the relative cost of holding on to the metal, which doesn't offer investors any similar guaranteed payout.
Meanwhile, crude oil futures surged 3% on Monday, amid speculation an ongoing collapse in rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. will result in lower production and as investors assessed the impact of last week’s Iranian nuclear deal on global supplies.
Oil prices plunged late last week after Western powers negotiated a tentative nuclear deal with Tehran, which could add more crude to an already oversupplied market.
However, futures have since regained some ground with market experts largely estimating that a ramp-up in Iranian crude exports could take several months.

EUR/USD hit a session high of 1.1026, the pair's strongest level since March 26, before pulling back slightly to trade at 1.1022 during U.S. morning hours, up 0.46%.
New York Fed President William Dudley said earlier that the timing of a future interest rate hike in the U.S. remains uncertain.
""The timing of normalization will be data dependent and remains uncertain because the future evolution of the economy cannot be fully anticipated,"" Dudley said in prepared remarks.
His comments came after weaker than expected U.S. employment data on Friday prompted investors to push back expectations for a rate hike in the U.S. to the end of the year.
The Labor Department said that the U.S. economy added just 126,000 new jobs in March, the smallest increase since December 2013 and sharply below forecasts for a gain of 245,000.

255,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 06, 2015 07:00AM ET</span>",Forex - U.S. dollar edges lower on delayed Fed rate hike outlook,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower against most if its major rivals on Monday, as weaker than expected U.S. employment data prompted investors to push back expectations for a rate hike in the U.S. to the end of the year.
Trading activity was subdued on Friday with many investors away from their desks for the Easter weekend. Volumes were expected to remain light on Monday, as markets in Europe, the U.K. and China stayed closed for holidays.
The dollar remained under pressure after the Labor Department reported Friday that the U.S. economy added 126,000 new jobs in March, the smallest increase since December 2013 and significantly below expectations for a gain of 245,000.
The disappointing report makes it more likely that the Federal Reserve will wait until the end of the year to raise interest rates from record low levels. Market players had previously speculated that U.S. interest rates could start to rise as early as June.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was little changed at 96.86.
Elsewhere, gold futures rallied sharply as investors increased bets the Federal Reserve will hold off on raising interest rates until later this year following the release of disappointing U.S. employment data.
A delay in raising interest rates would be seen as bullish for gold, as it decreases the relative cost of holding on to the metal, which doesn't offer investors any similar guaranteed payout.
Meanwhile, crude oil rose more than $1 on Monday, as investors assessed the impact of last week’s Iranian nuclear deal on global supplies.
Oil prices plunged late last week after Western powers negotiated a tentative nuclear deal with Tehran, which could add more crude to an already oversupplied market.
However, futures have since regained some ground with market experts largely estimating that a ramp-up in Iranian crude exports could take several months.

""This deal is not based on trust, it is based on unprecedented verification.""It is believed that the severe economic and financial sanctions against the Persian Gulf nation will be lifted on a staggered, step-by-step basis depending on how cooperative it is with inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency. Sanctions that have limited the Iranian Banking System will be among the limitations that could be initially removed, NBC News reported.""The European Union will terminate the implementation of all economic and financial sanction and the U.S. will cease the application of all economic and financial sanctions,"" EU Vice President Federica Mogherini said at a joint news conference with Iran.Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Labor said Thursday that initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined by 20,000 last week to a seasonally-adjusted level of 268,000, the lowest level since January. Economists had expected initial claims to rise to 285,000.The four-week average, considered a better approximation of labor trends, also dropped by 14,750 to 285,500. In addition, U.S. factory orders for February inched up 0.2%, after six consecutive monthly declines. In a separate report released Thursday, the U.S. trade balance decreased from $42.7 billion in January to $35.4 billion in February, amid lower oil prices and a stronger dollar.Traders await the release of Friday's U.S. jobs report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for further guidance on potential currency fluctuations. A panel of economists predicted that the workforce added 248,000 non-farm jobs last month, down slightly from February's increase of 295,000. The labor force has added at least 200,000 jobs per month for every month over the last year. Economists expect that unemployment will remain fairly constant at a level of 5.5%. Elsewhere, Reuters reported that Greece told its creditors on Wednesday that it could run out of money on April 9. On that date, Greece owes a €450 million payment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Greece could meet its obligation to the IMF or repay government salaries and pensions, but might be unable to do both.

EUR/USD likely received support at 1.05 its low from Mar. 11 and resistance at 1.14 its high from mid-February.
The pair remained constant at 1.0892 following an announcement in Lausanne, Switzerland that Iran and Western powers had reached a deal on the framework of a preliminary Iranian nuclear pact before a final agreement could be reached in late-June.
""This framework would cut off the pathway Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon,"" U.S. president Barack Obama said at a news conference outside the White House. ""This deal is not based on trust, it is based on unprecedented verification.""
It is believed that the severe economic and financial sanctions against the Persian Gulf nation will be lifted on a staggered, step-by-step basis depending on how cooperative it is with inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency. Sanctions that have limited the Iranian Banking System will be among the limitations that could be initially removed, NBC News reported.
""The European Union will terminate the implementation of all economic and financial sanction and the U.S. will seize the application of all economic and financial sanctions,"" EU Vice President Federica Mogherini said at a joint news conference with Iran.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Labor said Thursday that initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined by 20,000 last week to a seasonally-adjusted level of 268,000, the lowest level since January. Economists had expected initial claims to rise to 285,000.
The four-week average, considered a better approximation of labor trends, also dropped by 14,750 to 285,500. In addition, U.S. factory orders for February inched up 0.2%, after six consecutive monthly declines. In a separate report released Thursday, the U.S. trade balance decreased from $42.7 billion in January to $35.4 billion in February, amid lower oil prices and a stronger dollar.
Traders await the release of Friday's U.S. jobs report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for further guidance on potential currency fluctuations. A panel of economists predicted that the workforce added 248,000 non-farm jobs last month, down slightly from February's increase of 295,000. The labor force has added at least 200,000 jobs per month for every month over the last year. Economists expect that unemployment will remain fairly constant at a level of 5.5%.
On Mar. 6, the euro fell roughly 1.8% to 1.08 after a strong U.S. jobs report coincided with the start of the European Central Bank's €60 billion a month quantitative easing program.
Elsewhere, Reuters reported that Greece told its creditors on Wednesday that it could run out of money on April 9. On that date, Greece owes a €450 million payment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Greece could meet its obligation to the IMF or repay government salaries and pensions, but might be unable to do both.

The modest gains, however, were softened by continuing drama in Greece, as the nation's sovereign debt crisis weighed on the euro. The euro retreated in U.S. afternoon trading after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) released an ominous note to investors on the ramifications of a potential Greek default if the nation leaves the European Union.
EUR/USD fell to 1.0759 in U.S. afternoon trading, from a daily-high of 1.0794 hours earlier. The pair still inched up 0.24% for the session.
The euro's rally against the dollar, came one day after it fell nearly 1% on Tuesday to 1.0733 -- its largest daily loss since Mar 19. The currency pair also reached its lowest level on Tuesday since Mar. 20 when relatively dovish comments from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen spurred a brief rally in the euro.
EUR/USD likely received support at 1.05 its low from Mar. 11 and resistance at 1.14 its high from mid-February.
The pair moved mildly higher on Wednesday from 1.0744 to 1.076, following the release of ADP's National Employment Report, a monthly report that measures the change in total non-farm private employment on a seasonally-adjusted basis. Last month, the U.S. Private Sector added 189,000 jobs for the month of March, far below economists' forecasts of the addition of 225,000, according to ADP. The subdued private sector job growth marked its lowest increase since January, 2014.
The report comes ahead of Friday's highly-anticipated U.S. jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which will be released while commodity markets remain closed for Good Friday. On Mar. 6, when the BLS reported that unemployment nationwide declined to 5.5% for the previous month, the euro slid roughly 2% to 1.08 amid speculation that an interest-rate hike from the Federal Reserve could be imminent.
Greece, meanwhile, is reportedly running out of time to secure critical aid from its euro zone creditors that could be vital to stave off bankruptcy. Earlier this week the creditors rejected Greece's latest proposal of reforms, deeming the austerity measures a ""list of ideas,"" rather than a ""concrete plan.""
As negotiations near a standstill, investors continue to withdraw funds from Greek banks at a high rate. Households pulled out €8.8 billion from banks throughout the country in January and an additional €5.4 billion a month later, Goldman told investors. Corporations, meanwhile, withdrew €3.3 bil in January, before taking out €1.9 bil during the month of February.
""We think these developments are more important than the market is giving them credit for,"" Goldman Sachs strategist Robin Brooks wrote in the investors note.
Yields on Greek 10-Year bonds rose 0.18 to 11.81 on Wednesday, while yields on the German 10-Year bunds rose 0.002 to 0.174.
In the U.S., yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries plunged 0.075 to 1.859, while yields on U.S. 30-Year Treasuries fell 0.077 to 2.466.

EUR/USD fell more than 0.9% in U.S. afternoon trading to 1.0733, its largest one-day decline since Mar. 19. The currency pair also reached its lowest level since Mar. 20 when relatively dovish comments from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen spurred a brief rally in the euro.

In addition, consumer expectations for economic activity over the next six months of 2015 surged to 96.0, up from a revised level of 90.0. Economists had predicted that the level would fall to 87.2 for the month.

In Europe, officials from the European Union and International Monetary Fund (IMF) described a set of austerity measures submitted by Greece at the end of last week as a list of ideas rather than a concrete plan. Greece's creditors have deemed the reforms necessary in order to unlock critical financial aid. The two sides reportedly remain far apart on critical issues such as Greek pension reform and debt relief.
Greece is running out of time before a €450 mil payment is due to the IMF next week.

321,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 29, 2015 09:23AM ET</span>",ETX Capital acquires Alpari’s client list,"Investing.com - Online spread betting firm ETX Capital has purchased the client data of former retail foreign exchange broker Alpari UK from administrators KPMG for an undisclosed sum.
ETX Capital purchased data relating to approximately 160,000 accounts, allowing it to set up new trading accounts for former Alpari clients. Outstanding funds which are due these clients can be transferred to new accounts with ETX.
Alpari collapsed in January following extreme volatility in the Swiss franc when the Swiss National Bank scrapped its exchange rate peg with the euro. The company sustained substantial financial losses as a result of negative client balances and was declared insolvent.
EXT Capital’s Chairman John Wilson said the company has had a very good first quarter despite the issues that brought down Alpari and he expects this deal to further accelerate growth following record revenue and profits in 2014.
KPMG said it was pleased to have concluded the sale and added that it would continue to work to maximize the level and speed of return to clients and creditors.
Andrew Edwards, ETX Capital’s CEO said the last few months have been difficult for Alpari customers.
“Whilst the clients may pursue their funds themselves through the administration process, we hope they accept our offer of assistance in facilitating a smooth transition of their funds to ETX Capital.”
“We are very excited about this deal as it complements two of our main strategic drives: the expansion of our Metatrader 4 offering and the continued expansion of our international customer base.”

325,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 27, 2015 06:09PM ET</span>",Little movement with EUR/USD following Yellen's speech in San Fran,"Investing.com -- The U.S. dollar remained relatively unchanged against the euro following Janet Yellen's speech at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Conference on Friday afternoon, minutes before the close of U.S. markets.
EUR/USD fell slightly to 1.089 at the end of U.S. trading slightly below its level of 1.0904 minutes before the start of Yellen's lecture. For the session, the pair inched up 0.0006 or 0.05%.
EUR/USD likely received support at 1.05 its low from Mar. 11 and resistance at 1.14 its high from mid-February.
Yellen, the chair of the Federal Reserve, reiterated on Friday that an interest rate hike ""may be warranted later this year,"" if the Fed is reasonably confident that there is continued improvement in the economy. Still, Yellen said she does not need to see an increase in core inflation before the Fed decides to raise rates. The Fed, she added, could begin to raise rates before inflation reaches its target goal of 2%.
At the same time, Yellen emphasized that the Fed will proceed cautiously to avoid tightening too quickly. She cited the deleterious effects of premature rate hikes in Sweden and Japan as factors for why the Fed should raise rates ""gradually.""
Earlier on Friday, the dollar pared modest gains in morning trading after the release of disappointing economic data. The U.S. Commerce Department said in a report that GDP for the fourth quarter expanded at a seasonally-adjusted rate of 2.2%. Economists had forecasted an upward revision of 2.4%. On a year-over-year basis, economic output for the fourth quarter increased by 2.4% from the same period a year earlier. By comparison, U.S. GDP grew by 2.7% for the third quarter versus the same quarter during the prior year.
During a question and answer session in San Francisco, Yellen remarked that U.S. net exports are expected to lower GDP growth due in large part to a stronger dollar. If the Fed decides to tighten monetary policy this year, it will come in the face of widespread quantitative easing measures throughout the world.
""We have to take into account the global economic environment and the effect it has on our outlook. We've had weakness in a number of countries including the euro area and Japan,"" Yellen said. ""We've had expansionary monetary policy in those economies that have pushed down rates considerably, inducing capital inflows that have pushed up the value of the dollar.""
In Europe, meanwhile, Greek leaders said on Friday that they submitted a list of reform measures to its euro zone creditors that were required for the nation to receive a much-needed lifeline, as it attempts to stave off bankruptcy. The European leaders reportedly began to review the proposals on Friday.
Yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries fell 0.049 to 1.96 on Friday, while yields on German 10-Year bunds dropped 0.01 to 0.21."

335,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 26, 2015 05:34PM ET</span>","EUR/USD falls sharply amid strong U.S. data, forecasts for parity","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell sharply on Thursday amid continued instability in Greece and strong economic data in the U.S.
The euro fell 0.0086 or 0.78% in U.S. afternoon trading to 1.0885. The pair moved above 1.10 at 1.1056 on Thursday morning to 1.1056 after opening at 1.0972. It also dipped below 1.086 on a volatile day of trading.
EUR/USD likely received support at 1.05 its low from Mar. 11 and resistance at 1.14 its high from mid-February.
Earlier this month, EUR/USD appeared to be headed toward parity after depreciating rapidly following the release of a strong U.S. jobs report on Mar. 6. The improved economic outlook fueled speculation of a sooner than expected interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve.
The euro, however, rallied at the middle of last week following relatively dovish comments from Fed chair Janet Yellen on slower long-term increases for inflation, interest rates and GDP. Some analysts interpreted the comments as a signal that the Fed could wait until after its meeting in June to institute a rate hike.
One European bank, though, forecasts that parity could occur ahead of previous estimates. The London bank  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) said on Thursday it expects parity by the third quarter of 2015, up from prior forecasts of the fourth quarter this year. Convergence in monetary policy between the U.S. and Europe could be the biggest driver in the march to parity, Barclays added. While the U.S. is expected to tighten monetary policy at some point this year, the European Central Bank is in the first month of its €60 billion a month quantitative easing program that is intended to jumpstart investments in the euro zone.
""The two main drivers we identified of euro weakness low economic returns to capital and the European Central Bank's commitment to lower rates for longer -- have probably increased a bit more. said Martin Barth, Barclays European head of foreign trading at a company presentation on Thursday. ""There's the incredible economic divergence between the two regions.""
Also on Thursday, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta chairman Dennis Lockhart told CNBC that he would wait until the middle of the year or perhaps even later before raising rates. Lockhart's comments came after a mix of economic indicators this week that could cause the Fed to exercise greater caution.
In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor said on Thursday that individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending Mar. 21 declined by 9,000 to 282,200. Analysts expected initial jobless claims to fall by 1,000 to 290,000 last week. One day earlier, however, U.S. durable goods orders fell by 1.4% for the month of February, marking the sixth straight month that U.S. business investment spending had declined.
In Berlin, meanwhile, Germany finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble blamed low interest rates for unstable economic conditions in the country.
""We have an interest rate environment that is creating huge problems for us in Germany. A low interest rate environment leads to a misallocation of resources with all the risks and side effects that you see when bubbles are forming,"" Schäuble said at a banking event in Berlin.
In recent weeks, Schäuble has been one of the most vociferous critics of the euro zone for its handling of the Greece Debt Crisis. On Thursday, Greece said it would present a list of reform measures to its euro zone creditors by next Monday. It is expected that Greece will include reforms to boost tax revenues as part of its plan.
Yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries increased 0.076 on Thursday to close at 1.996. The yield is still down more than 10 basis points from its level at the start of the year. Yields on the German 10-Year bunds were flat at 0.22."

346,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 25, 2015 05:26PM ET</span>","EUR/USD reaches two-week high, amid weak U.S. durable goods data","Investing.com -- The euro continued its recent hot streak against the U.S. dollar, moving above 1.10 as weak data on U.S. durable goods strengthened the case for delaying a potential interest rate hike.
EUR/USD rose steadily in U.S. morning trading to reach a two-week high at 1.103 before settling at 1.0974. The pair gained 0.44% or .0048 as it continues its steady rebound from early last week when parity appeared inevitable.
On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Commerce said in a monthly report that durable or long-lasting goods orders dipped by a seasonally adjusted 1.4% for the month of February. Orders for January were also revised downward to a 0.1% decline for the month. As a result, investment spending by U.S. businesses has dropped for six straight months.
The soft data weighed on the dollar, as the U.S. Dollar Index fell slightly by 0.30% to 97.14 in U.S. afternoon trading. The index measures the strength of the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies.
The lack of strength in the dollar was reflected in Wednesday's auction of U.S. 5-Year Treasuries, where weak demand caused yields to fall to 1.375%. The bid to cover ratio also fell to 2.35, its lowest ratio since July, 2009. In recent months, the average bid to cover ratio has been around 2.63.
While yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries rose 0.049 or 2.59% on Wednesday, they still remained under 2% at 1.927. Yields on German 10-Year bunds fell 0.02 to 0.22%.
In London, meanwhile, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank president Charles Evans said until the Fed was reasonably confident that inflation was moving back near 2%, he saw no reason to hurry and raise interest rates. Speaking at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, Evans urged the Fed to delay an interest rate hike until the middle of next year. Evans has been a long proponent of keeping interest rates low to avoid disinflation.
Elsewhere, Greece failed in its bid to receive a short-term cash payment from its euro zone creditors providing another blow to the cash-strapped nation, which is becoming increasingly desperate to avoid bankruptcy. Greek leaders had made a bid to receive a €1.2 billion payment from the European Financial Stability Facility, after claiming it overpaid on a transfer to the fund earlier in March.
""We see no reason to release it,"" Germany Finance Ministry spokesman Martin Jaeger said at a news conference on Wednesday.
Greece is running out of time before its next debt payments are due. On April 8, Athens owes the International Monetary Fund more than €460 mil on a loan from its 2010 bailout. Five days later, Greece must make a €1.4 billion payment to holders of its short-term treasury bills."

Lower mortgage rates following a cut to the central bank's cash rate to a record low 2.25% in February are expected to boost housing demand further, the Reserve Bank of Australia said Wednesday in its biannual Financial Stability Review.There was no strong language on housing-market risk in the review but it reiterated the need to monitor this to ensure existing risk in the mortgage market doesn't worsen.Indicators of household stress are currently at low levels but could start to increase if labor-market conditions weaken further than currently envisaged,"" the RBA said.AUD/USD traded at 0.7884, down 0.06%, while USD/JPY changed hands at 119.70, down 0.04% and EUR/USD was quoted at 1.0932, up 0.06%.New Zealand released February trade data that showed a month-on-month surplus of NZ$50 million, well below the expected NZ$392 million.NZD/USD traded at 0.7647, down 0.07%.Overnight, the dollar turned broadly higher against a basket of other major currencies on Tuesday, after upbeat U.S. consumer price inflation and new home sales data fuelled fresh optimism over the strength of the economy.The dollar strengthened after data showed that U.S. consumer prices rose 0.2% in February, in line with market expectations, rebounding after a 0.7% decline in January.Core inflation, which excludes food and energy costs ticked up 0.2% in February after a similar gain in January.

EUR/USD dipped 0.15% or 0.0016 in U.S. afternoon trading to 1.0931. Earlier on Tuesday morning, the pair moved above 1.10 for the first time in more than two weeks while reaching a daily high of 1.1030. Trading wavered throughout the day, plunging at one point to 1.0892.
On Mar. 5, EUR/USD fell to 1.0987, marking the first time in 12 years that the pair slipped below 1.10. Expectations of an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve coincided with the start of a €60 billion a month bond buying program, spurring one of the sharpest falls in the pair in years. By Mar. 13, EUR/USD had reached a level around 1.05.
Just as quickly as the euro plunged, it nearly reversed all of the losses in recent days following relatively dovish comments by Fed chair Janet Yellen on slower than expected inflation and GDP growth.
The Labor Department on Tuesday said its Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.2% for February, one month after declining 0.1%. The slight uptick last month ended a three-month streak of declines. On a year-over-year basis the CPI remained unchanged from its February 2014 level, though analysts had forecasted it to slip by 0.1% from last year's figure.
Yellen indicated the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will take a ""data-driven"" approach on the timing of its first interest rate hike since 2009. The Fed would like inflation to approach its target goal of around 2% before it raises its benchmark Federal Funds Rate.
Speaking in England on Tuesday, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis president James Bullard emphasized that the timing is right to hike rates above their current level of near 0%.
""Zero is no longer the appropriate interest rate for the U.S. economy,"" Bullard said during a panel session at London City Week.
Echoing comments made by Federal Reserve vice chairman Stanley Fischer a day earlier, Bullard indicated that the policy actions from the Fed could be ""extremely accommodative,"" to market conditions and that lift-off could begin with small increases. In its report released last week, the FOMC forecasted that interest rates could rise over the next several years at a rate slower than had previously been anticipated.
Elsewhere, there was little progress between Greece and its euro zone creditors one day after Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras and Germany chancellor Angela Merkel put on a public display of goodwill during Tsipras' first visit to Berlin since he was elected earlier this year.
Back in Athens, Greek citizens continued to digest the resignation of Greece's bank-fund chairman Christos Sclavounis on Monday. The Hellenic Financial Stability Fund, headed by Sclavounis, received more than €48 billion in bailout funds between 2012 and 2014.
Greece is running out of time before its next debt payments are due. On April 8, Athens owes the International Monetary Fund more than €460 mil on a loan from its 2010 bailout. Five days later, Greece must make a €1.4 billion payment to holders of its short-term treasury bills.
Meanwhile, the yield on the German 10-Year bunds rose 0.01 to 0.23, while yields on the U.S. 10-Year Treasuries fell 0.04 to 1.875."

371,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 23, 2015 05:54PM ET</span>","EUR/USD continues rally, remaining above 1.09 in U.S. afternoon trading","Investing.com -- While the U.S. dollar extended its recent slide against the euro on Monday, comments from Federal Reserve vice chair Stanley Fischer and leaders in Europe discussing the Greek financial crisis had little impact on currency prices in afternoon trading.
EUR/USD reached 1.909 on Monday, its highest level in two weeks, before falling back slightly to 1.094 in afternoon trading. When EUR/USD fell to 1.0987 on Mar. 5, it marked the first time the pair slipped below 1.10 in 12 years, as expectations of an expected interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve coincided with the start of a €60 billion a month bond buying program.
The pair continued its steep depreciation to 1.05 levels on Mar. 13, before reversing in the middle of last week following relatively dovish comments by Fed chair Janet Yellen on slower than expected inflation and GDP growth. The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.75% on Monday to 97.24.
Striking a well-balanced tone in a speech to the Economic Club of New York on Monday afternoon, Fischer indicated that the Fed will begin raising interest rates when the benefits of lift-off outweigh the costs. Fischer reiterated that the Fed will likely raise interest rates at some point this year.
In addition, Fischer added that a ""smooth plan upward will certainly not be realized,"" as the Fed has no plans for regular rate hikes. The stance differs from one the Fed employed on two occasions in 2004 and 2007 when it employed a model for steady rate raises on a long-term basis.
Although the Fed is hesitant to discuss the strength of the dollar relative to the euro and other currencies, Fischer indicated that it is keeping a closing eye on exchange rates to guard against potential cases for manipulation of the foreign exchange markets.
""What is not acceptable is manipulating exchange rates, trying to use them as the sole means of generating growth,"" Fischer said. ""That has not happened as far as we can tell in our partner countries.""
Elsewhere, Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras and Germany chancellor Angela Merkel put on a public display of goodwill during Tsipras' first visit to Berlin since he was elected earlier this year. Still, there were no indications on whether any progress had been made in negotiations on extending the euro zone's bailout package to Greece during talks on Monday.
Meanwhile, Mario Draghi expressed frustration with Athens in testimony before the European Parliament when a member from Portugal asked the head of the European Central Bank to respond to accusations that it is blackmailing Greece into accepting strict austerity measures.
""It's a bit of reach when you look at the exposure we have with Greece. ECB has an exposure of €104 billion to Greece, this is equal to 65% of Greek GDP,"" Draghi responded. ""It's the highest exposure in the euro zone, so what sort of blackmail is this? It's up to you judge.""
Yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries remained significantly below 2% at 1.909, while yields on 10-Year German bunds increased 0.04 to 0.22."

389,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 20, 2015 05:33PM ET</span>","EUR/USD continues path of volatility, as dollar falls below 1.08 ","Investing.com -- EUR/USD continued on a path of unprecedented volatility on Friday, as the euro appreciated sharply against the dollar days after parity appeared inevitable.
Two days after relatively dovish comments from Fed chair Janet Yellen sent the dollar spiraling, the euro gained more than 1.5% against its American counterpart on Friday to end the week at 1.0824. Last week at this time, the euro plunged to 1.05 -- reaching an 11-year low.
Although Yellen indicated that the Fed could start to raise its benchmark Federal Funds Rate by June at the earliest, she still appeared to strike a dovish tone with lower forecasts on inflation and GDP growth. The U.S. central bank also forecasted that interest rates will rise at a slower pace than had previously been expected.
Previously, the euro had been in freefall as expectations for an interest rate hike in the U.S. coincided with the start of the European Central Bank’s EUR 60 billion per month quantitative easing program. In quantitative easing, policy makers purchase securities with the new printed currencies to raise the money supply in the wider system. Monetary easing programs are intended to drive up the market price of bonds. When bond prices increase, yields decrease lowering the rates for mortgages and other loans.
Last month, the spread between yields on the U.S. 10-year and Germany 10-year reached a 25-year high, as yields on U.S. treasuries spiked while the bund plummeted. In recent days, however, yields on U.S. treasuries have moved in an inverse direction. On Friday, U.S. sovereign debt yields fell across the board as the 10-year dropped 0.049 to 1.92, the U.S. 30-year fell 0.035 to 2.503 and the U.S. 2-year dove 0.036 to 0.581.
The euro continued its rally at week’s end, as German chancellor Angela Merkel took a hard stance against Greece in negotiations regarding the euro zone’s bailout package to Athens. Merkel set strict terms on the critical stimulus package Greece could receive from its euro zone creditors, reiterating that it will only be approved if the euro zone approves a list of economic reform measures Athens intends to propose shortly.
Merkel’s comments came ahead of her scheduled meeting with Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras in Berlin on Monday.
One day after the Greece 10-year spiked to a two-year high of 12.2%, it dropped 54 basis points to 11.1 on Friday.

393,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2015 09:10AM ET</span>",Russia's Putin calls for regional currency union,"By Denis Dyomkin and Raushan Nurshayeva
ASTANA (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed on Friday creating a regional currency union with Belarus and Kazakhstan, Russia's main partners in a union of ex-Soviet states facing growing economic challenges. 
Putin made his proposal at a meeting with the Belarussian and Kazakh presidents, who did not respond in public but have been lukewarm about such proposals.
""The time has come to start thinking about forming a currency union,"" Putin told reporters after the talks in the Kazakh capital Astana with Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko and Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev.
He gave no details but suggested it would be beneficial for the three countries to work closely together as they try to overcome their economic difficulties.
Kazakhstan, the second-largest post-Soviet oil producer and economy after Russia, has said the three nations should synchronize their monetary policies before considering adopting a single currency.
Grigory Marchenko, a former head of Kazakhstan's central bank, has estimated that it would take 10 to 12 years before such a currency was introduced. 
""Two days ago we met with our prime minister,"" another former Kazakh central bank chief, Oraz Jandosov, told Reuters. ""We asked him about this and he said: 'We know nothing about this. This is their (Russia's) initiative. We haven't spoken about this (with the Russians)',"" he said. 
TOUGH TIMES 
Independent analysts doubt the idea will get off the ground.
""A currency union would be a bad mistake in many ways. Luckily, we can be confident that Belarus and Kazakhstan will never agree to it,"" said Christopher Granville, managing director of consultancy Trusted Sources in London.
""Lukashenko did in fact sign up to a monetary union with Russia in the 1990s and spent the best part of a decade wriggling out of that commitment since he realized that it meant the end of Belarusian sovereignty.""
The three leaders made clear it would be a tough year for countries in the Eurasian Economic Union, the Russia-led political and economic bloc they have formed with Armenia, with Kyrgyzstan set to join later this year. 
Putin dream of the Eurasian Economic Union matching the economic muscle of the European Union, the United States and China is a long way from fruition, though it has an integrated single market of more than 170 million people.
The fall in oil prices and Western economic sanctions over Ukraine have worsened an economic slowdown in Russia, and the rouble has declined by about 40 percent against the dollar since midway through last year.

Belarus devalued its own rouble in January and there has been speculation on markets that Kazakhstan may soon devalue its currency, the ten, little more than a year after a more than 19 percent devaluation.

For 2016, the Fed projects that inflation will be between 1.7% and 1.9%.Last month in testimony before Congress, Yellen said that the Fed wanted to see inflation move toward its target goal of 2% before it raised interest rates.In spite of the revisions, Yellen went out of her way to note that overall the forecast was not weak.

Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said while the Fed has not decided on the timing of a rate hike, it is possible it could come at any Federal Open Market Committee meeting this year after the FOMC concludes its next meeting in April.
Following the release of the Fed’s statement around 2 p.m. EST, the dollar plummeted against the euro, moving well below its high of 1.059 in U.S. morning trading. EUR/USD reached 1.065 as investors awaited the release of the statement, before surging more than 2% to a daily-high of 1.093 shortly after markets closed.

EUR/USD almost unchanged for the day at 1.0601, having rebounded from the 12-year lows of 1.0461 struck on Friday.

The single currency weakened across the board after the European Central Bank started asset purchases under its trillion-euro quantitative easing program earlier this month, pushing euro area bond yields to new lows.
The Bank of Japan expanded it stimulus program in late October amid concerns that falling oil prices could lower the inflation outlook.

EUR/USD inched up 0.0021 or 0.20% to 1.0591 in U.S. afternoon trading. The pair dipped below 1.057 in overnight trading before rising to a daily-high of 1.0650 several hours later. EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.05, its 12-year low from last week, while receiving resistance at $1.14, the one-month high from Feb. 17.
The Federal Reserve could remove a reference to remaining patient from its minutes when the Federal Open Market Committee begins a two-day meeting on Wednesday. The removal usually provides an indication that the U.S. central bank is ready to raise interest rates at some point this year. Typically, when the Fed eliminates such language it signals that an interest rate hike will occur at either of its next two meetings. Following this week's meeting, the FOMC will convene in June as well as September.
Efforts by the Fed to tighten monetary policy can cause the dollar to strengthen against other major currencies. The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell slightly by 0.07% to 99.97. Last week, the index reached a 12-year high while eclipsing the 100 level.
The dollar's rally was also slowed by worse than expected housing data on Tuesday.
Last month, housing starts, according to the U.S. Commerce Department, fell by 17% to a seasonally adjusted pace of 897,000 units to reach the lowest level since January, 2014. Horrid weather throughout the Northeast for the month of February is thought to be responsible for the downturn. Housing permits have been above an adjusted pace of 1 million since July.

428,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2015 03:53AM ET</span>",Currency swings cost U.S. corporates $18.66 billion in the fourth quarter: study,"(Reuters) - Foreign exchange swings cost North American corporates $18.66 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter, according to a report by currency risk management consulting firm FiREapps.
Total negative currency impact rose more than four-fold in the fourth quarter from the previous quarter, and was the biggest since the height of the euro crisis, according to the report.
FiREapps analyzes currency effects on quarterly earnings of 846 North American companies, a subset of the Fortune 2000 companies that generate at least 15 percent of international revenue in two or more currencies. (http://bit.ly/1O1vOgS)
Earnings per share of North American corporates were hurt by $0.06 on an average, nearly double the 2013-2014 average and the highest since FiREapps began measuring the impact of currency swings.
A slew of U.S. multinational companies, from DuPont (N:DD) to Procter & Gamble (N:PG), have showed that a strong U.S. dollar hurt their earnings, and several blue-chip exporters said the situation will get worse if the greenback holds its strength.
The number of companies reporting a negative impact was 6.4 percent higher in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter, according to FiREapps.

A strong U.S. dollar is hurting multiple sectors, including industrial companies such as 3M Co (N:MMM), technology companies like  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL), airlines such as  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), healthcare companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (N:BMY) and  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE), and consumer firms like Procter & Gamble - which all garner a large portion of their sales from outside the United States.

EUR/USD gained 0.70% or 0.0073 to 1.0569 in U.S. afternoon trading. The pair fell below 1.05 at last week's close, as the start of the European Central Bank's €60 billion a month quantitative easing program coincided with expectations of an interest rate hike from the Fed. Since the start of the year, the pair is down roughly 10%.
Last week analysts from  Deutsche Bank  (XETRA:DBKGn) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) both revised their timetables on when the euro could reach parity against the dollar, moving up the dates from previous forecasts. Deutsche Bank even predicted that the euro could fall to 0.85 against the dollar by 2017. On Monday, Alan Ruskin head of foreign exchange strategy for Deutsche Bank, went one step further. 
Speaking with CNBC's Power Lunch, Ruskin said he thinks it is possible the euro could reach a historic low against the dollar of 0.82. The euro hasn't reached a level that low since 2002.
""If you think of what's driving the euro, a lot of this has been hedging from foreigners who've held euro bonds and euro equities,"" Ruskin told CNBC. ""I think that it will slow somewhere near parity.""
The Fed could remove its reference to ""remaining patient,"" from its minutes when the Federal Open Market Committee stages a two-day meeting this week, beginning on Wednesday. The reference typically indicates that it will start raising interest rates at either of its next two meetings. It has been six years since the U.S. central bank has increased rates, which have remained near zero since the Financial Crisis.
Elsewhere, Greece and its euro zone creditors appeared to be far apart in negotiations concerning the reform measures Athens must employ to extend a critical bailout package. Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras appears unwilling to agree to some of the austerity measures required by the euro zone in order to strike a deal.

""Whatever obstacles we may encounter in our negotiating effort, we will not return to the policies of austerity,"" Tsipras told Greece newspaper Ethnos.

EUR/USD was at 1.0512, close to Friday’s low of 1.0471, the weakest since January 9, 2003.
The single currency fell sharply after the European Central Bank started asset purchases under its trillion-euro quantitative easing program early last week, pushing euro area bond yields to new lows.
Lower bond yields make the single currency less attractive to investors at a time when expectations are building that the Federal Reserve could start rising interest rates mid-year.
Market participants were looking ahead to Wednesday’s Fed statement to see if it would drop its reference to being patient before raising rates and signal that it is ready to hike rates depending on economic data.
Sentiment on the euro was also hit by uncertainty over Greece’s future in the euro zone, after euro area finance ministers rejected proposed economic reforms put forward by Athens in exchange for more loans last week.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was last at 100.41 after rising to overnight peaks of 100.71, a level last reached in April 2003.

452,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 14, 2015 01:00PM ET</span>","EUR/USD slips below 1.05, as U.S. Dollar Index cracks 100 barrier","Investing.com -- The euro slipped below 1.05 against the U.S. dollar on Friday, as concerns mounted for European importers that EUR/USD could reached parity sooner than expected.
In U.S. afternoon trading, the euro fell 1.32% or 0.014 to 1.0497 to reach a 12-year low. The euro dropped steadily from session-highs of 1.0636 in European trading to cap a volatile week for the currency.
The euro has depreciated more than 10% against its U.S. counterpart for the year and nearly 40% since August. More than a third of the yearly decline has occurred over the last week, as investors geared up for the start of the European Central Bank's €60 billion a month quantitative easing program, which began on Monday.
In quantitative easing, policy makers purchase securities with the newly printed currencies to raise the money supply in the wider system. Monetary easing programs, such as the ones previously undertaken by central banks in the U.S. and Japan following the 2008 Financial Crisis, are intended to drive up the market price of bonds. When bond prices increase, yields decrease lowering the rates for mortgages and other loans.
One week into the initiative, the bond buying program appears on its way of accomplishing its intended effect. Yields on 10-year government bonds are down across the board in Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Belgium. On Friday, however, the German 10-Year bunds edged up 4.03% to 0.01, after reaching record-lows last week.
Questions, though, remain on whether the European Central Bank can attract enough buyers to snatch up the sovereign debt. Over the first three days of quantitative easing, the ECB made €10.3 billion in bond purchases, according to the Wall Street Journal. In addition, Norway's oil fund announced on Friday that it will sell $860 million in European bonds from its portfolio to invest in real estate.
The U.S. dollar continued its upward path against its major global competitors. The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the greenback versus a basket of six major currencies, cracked the historic 100 barrier underscoring the strength of the dollar. By late-afternoon, the index peaked at 100.37 to reach a level not seen since 2003.
Currency traders now await next week's critical Federal Open Market Committee meetings when the U.S. Federal Reserve could provide indications on how shortly it might raise interest rates. If the Fed decides to remove a reference to ""remaining patient,"" in its minutes, it typically indicates that interest rates could be raised at either of its next two meetings. After next week's meeting, the FOMC will meet in June and September.
Additional gains in the dollar were softened on Friday by weaker than expected U.S. economic data. The U.S. Labor Department said in a monthly report that producer prices in February declined by 0.5%, following a drop of nearly 1% a month earlier.

"
461,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 12, 2015 02:45PM ET</span>",Why Is The Euro Falling? ,"By Jessica Menton -

The euro is approaching parity with the U.S. dollar, something the world hasn't seen since 2002. The eurozone's official currency has tumbled 12 percent since the start of 2015, hitting a 12-year low of $1.0495 against the greenback Thursday.
Here are the four main factors driving the euro's steep decline this week:
 1. The ECB's QE Launch
The European Central Bank launched its massive quantitative easing program Monday. The effort will pump 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) into Europe's economy. That means 60 billion euros ($66.3 billion) will be injected each month over the next 18 months in an effort to restore the inflation rate back to targeted level of 2 percent and help boost economic growth in the troubled region. The ECB expects the bond-buying program to end in September 2016.
QE will continue to have a significant effect on the euro as the ECB pumps more money into its economy. By increasing the money supply, the ECB will weaken the euro against other major currencies. That will then help boost Europe's exports and inflation. A cheaper euro can boost its economy by making it easier for it to sell goods to other countries.
The ECB's QE program includes buying government bonds in order to push down their yields. With interest rates at record lows, investors are looking to move cash overseas into places such as the U.S., where they are likely to get a better return. As money flows out of Europe, the euro is depreciating.
 2. Looming Rate Hikes From U.S. Fed
The divergence of global central bank monetary policies is also hurting the euro. At the same time that the ECB is taking steps that weaken the euro, the U.S. Federal Reserve is adhering to policies that boost the dollar. The Fed is considering tightening its monetary policy by raising interest rates in 2015. Speculation over the timing of the Fed's action is adding to the volatility in the euro this week as the U.S. dollar continues to surge on the prospect of higher rates.
There was a similar depreciation in the U.S. dollar when the Fed started the quantitative easing or QE program following the financial crisis. During the first year of the Fed's 17-month initial round of QE, which began in November 2008, the dollar declined 16 percent against the euro. The greenback remained weak up until the Fed's asset-purchasing program ended in October. Since the Fed ended QE, the U.S. dollar has gained 20 percent against the euro.
Daily Exchange Rate (USD/EUR)
 3. ECB's Record Low Interest Rates 
A third factor economists attribute the euro's decline is Europe's record low interest rates. The ECB cut rates to an historic low of 0.05 percent in September as a way to fight the eurozone's creeping deflation.
Daily Exchange Rate (EUR/USD)
One of the main goals of the ECB's policy is to encourage eurozone banks and lenders to make more funds available to business and household borrowers at lower interest rates, aiming to boost private spending by lifting investment and consumption. But because the ECB policy reduces eurozone interest rates compared with interest rates in the U.S., it also increases the relative attractiveness of holding higher interest dollar-denominated debt as opposed to lower interest euro-denominated debt, says Gary Burtless, senior fellow and labor economist for the Brookings Institution.
When market participants sell their euro-denominated assets in order to buy the now-more-attractive dollar-denominated assets they must buy U.S. dollars to complete the purchases, increasing the value of the dollar compared with euro because the demand for dollars has increased compared with the demand for euros, Burtless explains.
This helps achieve a second goal of the ECB policy, which is to boost the demand for goods and services produced in the eurozone. The lower value of the euro helps European exporters become more competitive by making goods less expensive for overseas customers.
 4. Greece Crisis Is Adding To Euro Volatility 
Eurozone finance ministers granted Athens a four month extension to the country's bailout program last month amid the country's ongoing debt negotiations. But as Greece creeps back into the headlines, reigniting concerns about the country's possible exit from the eurozone, it adds more downward pressure on the euro.

EUR/USD gained .0059 or 0.56% to 1.606 in U.S. afternoon trading, after four consecutive days of precipitous declines, following the release of better than expected U.S. jobs data last Friday. The creation of 295,000 new U.S. jobs in February and a lower unemployment rate has fueled concerns that the Federal Reserve could hike interest rates before the end of June.
The report coincided with the start of the European Central Bank's €60 billion a month bond buying program on Monday that has caused bond yields to plummet to record-lows.
On Thursday, the pair rarely dropped below Wednesday's close of 1.0547, as the U.S. data painted a bleaker picture than previously had been expected. In U.S. morning trading, EUR/USD spiked to 1.067 after the U.S. Commerce Department reported that retail sales dropped 0.6% in February before dropping modestly for the remainder of the day. While the figure decreased for the third consecutive month, economists had only forecasted a decline of 0.3% for the month.
Shortly after, a separate report indicated that core retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline and food remained virtually unchanged one month after experiencing a 0.1% decline in January.
U.S. imports, meanwhile, grew by 0.4% for the month to break a seven-month streak of declines. The report noted, however, that inflationary pressures were softened because of lower petroleum prices.
In addition, the U.S. Labor Department reported that new claims for unemployment benefits fell by 36,000 to 289,000 last week providing an indication that the labor market is continuing to tick upward.
In Europe, meanwhile, borrowing costs for Spanish sovereign debt slipped below 1% for the first time ever. The yield hovered between a daily-low of 0.984 and 1.041% -- down approximately four basis points from Wednesday's close. This week, yields have fallen sharply on German, French, Belgian and Spanish 10-year bonds as the European Central Bank began its ambitious quantitative easing.
Through the first three days of the program, the ECB purchased approximately €9.8 billion in sovereign debt, according to multiple media reports.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, edged closer to 100 before falling back to 99.31 (-0.33%).

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The euro wallowed just above a fresh 12-year low early on Thursday having faced an unrelenting onslaught this week as the European Central Bank kicked off its 1 trillion euro bond-buying campaign.
The program has already driven yields of many euro zone bonds deeper into negative territory and others to all-time lows. A 30-year German bond now offers a yield that is less than that of a two-year U.S. Treasury note.
Unsurprisingly, investors kept well clear of the common currency. It fell as far as $1.0511, stopping just short of the March 2003 trough of $1.0501. A break there will only heat up talk of parity. The euro last stood at $1.0554.
Against sterling, it fell to its lowest in over seven years at 70.11 pence. It hit a record low of NZ$1.4434 and slumped to a near two-year trough 127.64 yen.
Developments in Greece continued to garner some attention, though Athens appeared to have made no headway in persuading euro zone partners to renegotiate terms of a 240 billion euro bailout. 
In contrast, the dollar climbed further, fueled in part by expectations the Federal Reserve is not far from lifting interest rates.
The dollar index came within a whisker of 100.00 for the first time since April 2003. Versus the yen, the greenback traded at 121.41, not far off an eight-year peak of 122.04 set on Tuesday.
""While our fair value metrics suggest USD gains are getting stretched, we note that positioning remains only moderately long USD at this point and, with U.S. yields still likely to rise in the weeks ahead, we think it makes sense to stay long,"" analysts at  BNP Paribas  (PARIS:BNPP) wrote in a note to clients. 
Against commodity currencies, the U.S. dollar hovered just below six-year peaks on its Canadian and Australian peers. 
Australia's employment data due at 0030 GMT will be the next test for the Aussie dollar. Any upside surprises could see markets quickly unwind already very bearish positions.
The New Zealand dollar came close to testing last month's four-year trough of NZ$0.7177 but rebounded to 73 U.S. cents after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand sounded less dovish than markets had positioned for.

""When you look through the statement, the threshold for cutting the cash rate right now is perhaps a little bit higher than what markets have been anticipating,"" said Nick Tuffley, economist at ASB Bank.

One day after Germany's largest bank forecasted parity between the euro and dollar at year's end, EUR/USD fell 1.37% or 0.0147 to 1.0549. For the year, the pair is down more than 20%.One-third of the drop has occurred since last Friday following stronger than expected U.S. employment data in the February jobs report. The creation of 295,000 new U.S. jobs, as well as a 5.5% unemployment rate has heightened concerns that the Fed could raise interest rates by June.
In turn, the U.S. dollar has soared as expectations of an increase of the Fed Funds Rate has coincided with the start of a €60 billion quantitative easing program by the European Central Bank. Next week, The Federal Open Market Committee could remove references of ""remaining patient"" from its minutes when it meets on Mar. 17-18. The removal typically indicates that an interest rate hike is imminent. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, continued its march toward 100, approaching a level it has not reached in more than a dozen years. In addition, the sharp rise of the dollar index in recent weeks has marked its second-highest appreciation in 40 years. On Wednesday, the index rose 1.23 or 1.25% to 99.84. 
In bond markets, major central banks flocked to U.S. government bonds as indirect bids soared 59% at Wednesday's U.S. 10-Year Treasury auction in comparison with February purchases. The spread between U.S. 10-Year Treasuries (2.13%) and German 10-Year bunds (0.03) continued to hover at 25-year highs (2.1), as the bund fell 14.10% on Wednesday. The decline caused further drops in 10-year French and Italian bonds, which each fell by more than 7%. 
After the close of U.S. markets on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve rejected the stress tests of the U.S. units of  Deutsche Bank  (XETRA:DBKGn) and Spanish bank Santander (MADRID:SAN), citing widespread deficiencies with their capital plans.
Elsewhere, tensions remained high between Greece and its euro zone creditors. Ewald Nowotny, a member of the ECB's decision-making Governing Council, warned of the consequence that could result if Greece leaves the euro zone.

""If you think of Greece and a big devaluation of the currency, going out of the euro and having their own currency -- would that be helpful? I doubt it very much,"" Nowotny told a conference in Frankfurt. ""There is just one industry that would be affected, tourism.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The battered euro took another plunge toward parity with the dollar on Wednesday, shedding over 1 percent to trade below $1.06 for the first time in 12 years as a 1.1 trillion euro bond-buying program began to bite.
The European Central Bank started buying sovereign bonds with newly created money on Monday in an effort to boost growth and inflation in the euro zone, sending yields on the debt of nearly all its countries to record lows and driving investors away from the euro. 
The single currency skidded to $1.0560 on Wednesday, down 1.3 percent on the day and adding to an almost 13 percent fall since the start of the year that is set to leave the euro with its worst quarter on record. 
""(The dollar and the euro) can go to parity and it can happen pretty quickly, within the next month or two,"" said Gian Marco Salcioli, Head of FX Sales at the investment banking arm of Italy's  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MILAN:ISP) Banca IMI (LONDON:IMI).
""It is like getting stuck in the traffic on the way to the seaside. You know you will get there, you just don't know when.""
Around a third of the euro's fall this year has come since Friday, when a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report fueled speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve could raise interest rates as soon as the middle of this year. 
Paul Lambert, who runs a $325 million currency fund at Insight Investment in London, said the euro's fall against the dollar this week had been exaggerated by a broad dollar rally since the jobs data, which also took the greenback to a 7-1/2-year high against the yen on Tuesday of 122.04. 
""In terms of the flow that we're hearing about ... it's not panic selling of euros,"" he said. ""We're hearing it's corporate flow, some fund flow, some speculative flow. None of it in itself is particularly outsized but it's all going in the same direction."" 
The euro fell across the board, hitting a seven-year low against sterling of 70.145 pence and even an 18-month low of 128.360 yen, which stayed close to its lows against the dollar. 

Benefiting from its gains against the euro and yen, the greenback soared 0.9 percent to a 12-year high of 99.507 against a basket of major currencies (DXY), within a whisker of the psychologically important 100 level last seen in April 2003.

There was little movement with the pair on Monday afternoon, following an announcement from the euro zone that Greece fell ""far short,"" with the reform measures it presented to a group of Europe's finance ministers two weeks ago. On Feb. 20, Greece and the euro zone tentatively agreed to extend the €240 billion stimulus program, which is set to expire in June.
""We've talked about this long enough now,"" said Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, chairman of the euro zone. ""We only have four months, let's get it done.""
Technical discussions between Greece and its troika of creditors, the European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, are now set for Wednesday in Brussels. Greece finance minister Yanis Varoufakis said his nation only has enough money to pay for salaries and pensions of public employees. At the end of this week, Greece owes roughly €2 billion in Treasury bill redemptions as well as obligations to the IMF.
Greece is seeking an additional 7 billion from its creditors to fulfill its short-term obligations. Varoufakis told an Italian newspaper on Sunday that Greece is considering holding a referendum to allow voters to decide whether the euro zone's measures are acceptable. Greece could default on its obligations if a deal is not reached and it decides to leave the euro zone.

517,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 07, 2015 05:22AM ET</span>","EUR/USD drops to 11-yr low, as Euro bond market plunges","Investing.com -- The euro fell to an 11-year low against the U.S. Dollar for the third consecutive day, as currency traders weighed the divergence that may ensue from the start of a monetary easing program in Europe with a potential interest rate hike in the United States.

EUR/USD closed at 1.0841 at the end of U.S. trading, down 0.0186 or 1.69%. The pair reached a daily-high at 1.0979 early in U.S. morning trading, before dropping 0.01% upon the release of a stronger than expected U.S. jobs report. In 2015, the euro has fallen more than 10% against the U.S. dollar.

On Friday, the euro slipped below 1.09 against the dollar for the first time since 2003. The currency's plunge continues, as the European Central Bank is set to begin its€60 billion a month quantitative easing program on Monday. ECB president Mario Draghi announced on Thursday that the bond buying program will last until September, 2016 or beyond if the central bank does not approach its target inflation rate of 2%.

Bond buying programs, such as quantitative easing, are pursued by policymakers as a way of stimulating the economy by driving up the market price of bonds. When bond prices increase, yields decrease lowering the rates for mortgages and other loans.

One far-reaching implication of printing vast quantities of a currency is that it drives down its value against other currencies on the foreign exchange market. The euro also fell more than 1% against the Yen and 0.85% against the Australian dollar on Friday.

More tellingly, the spread between 10-year U.S. Treasury notes (2.25%) and 10-year German bunds (0.39%) reached its widest margin in 25 years. Since late-January, the yield on 10-year U.S. treasuries are up more than 35%. The lower yield in German bonds, meanwhile, sent Spanish, Italian and Portuguese bonds spiraling to record lows.

The dollar soared against the euro on Friday following the release of positive U.S. employment data. The U.S. added 295,000 jobs in February, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 55,000 above forecasts for the month and January's figure of 239,000. Employment growth, meanwhile, has averaged 288,000 over the last three months, as the current unemployment rate fell from 5.7 to 5.5%.

Data concerning wage growth was less promising, as weekly hourly wages inched up three cents from January and 2% from this point last year. The Federal Open Market Committee could provide further details on the timetable for raising interest rates at its next meeting on Mar. 17-18."

EUR/USD slipped below 1.10 for the first time since 2003, before rallying slightly in U.S. afternoon trading to 1.1027 (-0.46%). At one point on Thursday, the euro reached an 11-year low of 1.0987. Thursday's decline marked the first six-day losing streak for the pair in more than a year.
In Cyprus, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi announced that the central bank will begin its quantitative easing program on Mar. 9, as expected. The €60 billion a month asset purchasing program will last until September, 2016 or beyond if the central bank does not approach its target inflation rate of 2%, Draghi said.
In addition, economists from the central bank estimated that the economy in the euro zone will grow 1.5% in 2015, 1.9% in 2016 and 2.1% in 2017. Furthermore, ECB economists expect that inflation in the euro zone will remain unchanged this year, increase by 1.5% next year and by 1.8% in 2017.
Bond buying programs, such as quantitative easing, are pursued by policymakers as a way of stimulating the economy by driving up the market price of bonds. When bond prices increase, yields decrease lowering the rates for mortgages and other loans.
One far-reaching implication of printing vast quantities of a currency is that it drives down its value against other currencies on the foreign exchange market. 
The central bank will also purchase bonds that contain a negative yield, Draghi added, as long as they don't fall below a rate of negative 0.2%. 
In the United States, meanwhile, traders awaited the release of Friday's monthly job report for the month of February. On Thursday, the U.S. Labor Department said the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment increased to the highest level since May.

""Further easing of policy may be appropriate over the period ahead, in order to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation consistent with the target. The Board will further assess the case for such action at forthcoming meetings.""
While the RBA has seen increases in credit lending to home buyers, it remains concerned by a sharp rise in home prices.
""The Bank is working with other regulators to assess and contain risks that may arise from the housing market,"" Mr. Stevens said in the statement. ""In other asset markets, prices for equities and commercial property have risen, in part as a result of declining long-term interest rates.""
The RBA made the announcement in advance of Wednesday's release of GDP data for the fourth quarter of 2014. Analysts have lowered forecasts of annual growth in the Australian economy to 2.3% down from previous estimates of 2.5.

585,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 27, 2015 05:20PM ET</span>",USD closes slightly higher against euro following mixed economic data,"Investing.com -- The euro weakened slightly against the U.S. dollar on Friday amid the release of mixed U.S. economic data and the approval of an extension of the Greece bailout in Germany. 

EUR/USD reversed previous gains late in U.S. trading after Federal Reserve vice chair Stanley Fischer announced that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) anticipates that it will raise its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at some point this year.



The euro fell 0.0003 or 0.03% to close at 1.1196. At one point during trading, the euro dropped to its lowest level against the U.S. dollar since the fall of 2003. 

EUR/USD reached a daily high of 1.1246 following the release of several U.S. economic indicators. U.S. gross domestic product for the final quarter of 2014 increased at a 2.2% rate, down from an initial estimate of 2.6%, the Commerce Department said. In the third quarter, the U.S. economy grew at rate of 5%. 


The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Business Barometer, also known as Chicago PMI, fell further than expected -- dropping to a five and a half year low of 45.8. The reading fell from 59.4 in January, following significant drops in production and order backlogs. In addition, frigid temperatures nationwide caused the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment index to drop for the month of February following an 11-year high the previous month. 

At the same time, there was positive news in the housing sector as pending home sales in the United States increased to its highest level in a year and half. The National Association of Realtors Pending Home Sales Index increased 1.7% for January, marking the fifth consecutive month of year-over-year gains. 

In spite of the weak euro, the STOXX Europe 600 Index increased 0.39% or 1.52 to 392.21. The index is up more than 13% for the year.
Also on Friday, Gemany's lower house of parliament approved a four-month extension of a bailout to Greece. Members voted to approve the euro zone €240 billion bailout by a vote of 541-32.

In a revised report, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index rose to 95.4 this month from 93.6 in January, beating expectations for an increase to 94.0.
The UoM also said that its inflation expectations for the next 12 months remained unchanged at 2.8% in February.
Separately, the National Association of Realtors said that U.S. pending home sales rose 1.7% in January, confounding expectations for an increase of 2.0%. December's figure was revised to a 1.5% decline from a previously estimated 3.7% drop.
Data also showed that the Chicago purchasing managers' index fell to five-and-a-half year low of 45.8 this month from a reading of 59.4 in January. Analysts had expected the index to tick down to 58.0 in February.
The reports came shortly after the Bureau of Economic Anaysis said that the U.S. gross domestic product expanded by 2.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014, below initial estimates for a growth rate of 2.6% but above expectations for 2.1%.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.23% to 95.13.
EUR/USD edged up 0.20% to 1.1220. The euro found some support after preliminary data showed that German consumer prices rose 0.9% this month, exceeding expectations for a 0.7% gain, after a 1.1% decline in January.
Data also showed that French consumer spending rose 0.6% last month, confounding expectations for a 0.5% fall. December's figure was revised to a 1.6% increase from a previously estimated 1.5% gain.
The dollar was steady against the yen, with USD/JPY at 119.36 and dropped against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF down 0.48% to 0.9484.
Official data earlier showed that Japan's household spending fell 0.3% last month, compared to expectations for a 0.4% rise, after a 0.4% increase in December.
Data also showed that Japan's retail sales declined at an annualized rate of 2.0% in January, more than the expected 1.3% drop, after a 0.2% uptick in December.
On the upside, preliminary data showed that Japan's industrial production increased by 4.0% in January, beating expectations for a 2.7% gain, after a 0.8% rise the previous month.
In Switzerland, data showed that the KOF economic barometer fell to 90.1 this month from 96.1 in January, whose figure was revised from a previously estimated 97.0. Analysts had expected the index to drop to 90.0 in February.
In other trade, sterling was higher, with GBP/USD adding 0.26% to 1.5445.

USD/CAD was up 0.28% to 1.2530 in late trade, and ended the week with gains of 0.6%.
The Canadian dollar weakened after official figures showed that domestic retail sales fell 2.0% in December, far worse than forecasts of a 0.3% decline and the biggest drop since April 2010. 
The drop in retail sales came as sales at gasoline stations fell 7.4% in December due to lower gas prices. 
The report indicated that the steep fall in oil prices since the second half of 2014 is hurting consumer confidence. A number of Canadian energy firms have announced cutbacks to their capital expenditure programs and some have also begun to lay off staff.
Canada’s central bank cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 0.75% in a surprise move last month, in response in response to the sharp drop in oil prices.

In its quarterly inflation report, the BoE said ""it is now more likely than not that CPI inflation will dip briefly below zero at some point in the first half of 2015,” and remain ""close to zero"" for most of the year.
However, BoE Governor Mark Carney said there was not threat of persistent deflation as the decline in inflation was due to falling petrol, food and energy prices.
Falling oil prices will be a net positive for the U.K. economy, Carney said, with take-home pay expected to grow at its fastest pace in a decade.The bank expects inflation to rise above its 2% target in two year time and to rise fractionally above that in three years’ time if interest rates rise as markets expect.
GBP/USD was up 0.65% to 1.5334 from 1.5226 ahead of the inflation report.
In a change to its forward guidance, the bank said it would now consider cutting interest rates below 0.5% if inflation dips more deeply into negative territory than expected.
""The MPC stands ready to take whatever action is needed, as events unfold, to ensure inflation remains likely to return to target in a timely fashion, Carney said.

EUR/CHF was down 0.86% to 1.0479 in late trade, off Thursday’s highs of 1.0640, the most since January 15.
The euro was pressured lower by steep losses against the dollar, which rallied after a robust U.S. jobs report for January reinforced expectations for a mid-year rate hike by the Federal Reserve.
The euro has been floating freely against the Swiss franc since Switzerland’s central bank abandoned its cap on the franc on January 15, sending the franc surging higher against the euro and the dollar.
The announcement came a week before the European Central Bank unveiled a €60 billion quantitative easing program, which would have sparked increased demand for the safe haven franc.
The SNB has indicated that it is still prepared to intervene in currency markets, even after abandoning its cap.
Late last month, Swiss media reported that the SNB is now unofficially targeting an exchange rate corridor of 1.05 to 1.10 francs per euro.
Figures from the SNB on Friday showed that the value of its foreign currency holdings rose to 498.4 billion Swiss francs in January from 495.1 billion francs in December.
The data indicated that the bank purchased approximately 60 billion Swiss francs worth of foreign currencies last month, in a bid to stem the appreciation of the franc.

EUR/USD hit 1.1336 during U.S. morning trade, the session low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.1331, tumbling 1.28%
The pair was likely to find support at 1.1260, the low of January 29 and resistance at 1.1499, Thursday's high.
The dollar strengthened broadly after the Labor Department said the U.S. economy added 257,000 jobs in January, beating expectations for an increase of 234,000. December's figure was revised to a 329,000 gain from a previously estimated 252,000 rise.

In addition, data showed that U.S. average hourly earnings rose 0.5% in January, exceeding expectations for a 0.3% gain, after a 0.2% fall the previous month.
Meanwhile, the euro remainder under pressure amid sustained Greece concerns, even as German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble said on Thursday that Greece's financial difficulties were the result of domestic problems, but that Germany would do all in its power to help.
Schauble was speaking at a joint press conference with his Greek counterpart Yanis Varoufakis in Berlin on Thursday.
The comments came after the European Central Bank said it would no longer accept Greek bonds as collateral for lending, shifting the burden on to Greece’s central bank to provide additional liquidity for its lenders and increasing pressure on Athens.
Greece’s government is seeking debt relief on its current €240 billion bailout, which has fuelled fears over a clash with its creditors that could bring about its eventual exit from the euro zone.

799,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 05, 2015 08:05AM ET</span>",Forex - Euro higher vs. Swiss franc amid SNB intervention speculation,"Investing.com - The euro rose to the highest level against the Swiss franc on Thursday since the Swiss National Bank scrapped its exchange rate cap last month, fuelling speculation that the Swiss National Bank was actively weakening the franc.
EUR/CHF was last up 0.73% to 1.0582, the highest level since January 15.
The euro has been floating freely against the Swiss franc since Switzerland’s central bank scrapped its three-and-a-half year old 1.20 per euro exchange rate cap in a shock move last month.
The announcement came a week before the European Central Bank unveiled a €60 billion a month government bond purchasing program aimed at combatting the threat of deflation in the euro zone.
The ECB’s quantitative easing program would have sparked increased demand for the safe haven franc, prompting the SNB to conclude that enforcing and maintaining the cap was no longer justified.
The SNB has indicated that it is still prepared to intervene in currency markets, even after abandoning its cap.
Over the weekend, Swiss media reported that the SNB is now unofficially targeting an exchange rate of 1.05 to 1.10 francs per euro. 
Figures from the SNB on Monday showed that sight deposits rose for a second consecutive week last week, indicating that the bank has been purchasing foreign currency in the market.
The single currency had weakened broadly in the previous session after the European Central Bank it would no longer accept Greek government bonds as collateral for lending.
The move shifted the burden on to Greece’s central bank provide additional liquidity for its lenders and increased pressure on the new Greek government to reach a fresh agreement with its lenders on the terms of its current €240 billion bailout.
In other trade, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.44% to 94.16, pressured lower by strength in the euro.

However, the reports also indicated that inflation pressures remain subdued, reinforcing expectations that rates will remain on hold at record lows for longer.

882,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 28, 2015 01:31AM ET</span>",Yuan's Now Fifth Most-Used Currency,"By Kukil Bora -

China’s yuan has become one of the top five most-used currencies in the world, overtaking the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar, according to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), an international financial transactions agency.
The yuan ranked fifth, accounting for a record 2.17 percent of global payments in December, up from 1.59 percent in October. The yuan was preceded by the Japanese yen with 2.69 percent, while the U.S. dollar topped the chart with 44.6 percent, followed by the euro and the British pound with 28.3 percent and 7.92 percent, respectively, according to SWIFT.
“It is a great testimony to the internationalization of the RMB (renminbi) and confirms its transition from an ‘emerging’ to a ‘business as usual’ payment currency,” Wim Raymaekers, head of banking markets at SWIFT, said in a statement, obtained by Reuters.
The Chinese government has been trying to boost the use of the yuan globally by appointing more clearing banks overseas, and also allowing investors to devote offshore holdings of the currency in domestic capital markets.
In December, global payments in yuan -- whose exchange rate is set by China’s central bank -- increased by 20.3 percent while growth for payments across all currencies was 14.9 percent during the same period, according to SWIFT.
Yuan payments grew by 102 percent over the last year, compared to an overall annual growth of 4.4 percent for all currencies, Reuters reported, adding that China is expected to approach the International Monetary Fund later this year for the yuan's inclusion to the IMF’s in-house currency basket.
“The yuan has a very high chance of being chosen as a reserve currency in the next IMF review,” Nathan Chow, an economist at DBS Group Holdings in Hong Kong, told Bloomberg. “The yuan could even surpass the yen in the rankings this year.”"

EUR/CHF was last down 0.51% to 1.0098 after rising as high as 1.0382 earlier. The pair had rallied more than 3% on Monday.
The euro has been floating freely against the Swiss franc since Switzerland’s central bank scrapped its three year old 1.20 per euro exchange rate cap on January 15.
The move came as prospects of quantitative easing by the European Central Bank to combat the threat of deflation in the euro area increased pressure on the Swiss franc.
The ECB unveiled €60 billion a month government bond purchasing program on January 22.
The euro is still approximately 16% lower against the franc since the SNB’S policy change.
In a newspaper interview published on Tuesday, SNB Vice President Jean-Pierre Danthine said it was still “fundamentally prepared” to intervene in currency markets, even after scrapping its cap.
“The minimum exchange rate couldn’t have been maintained anymore” with the ECB’s bond purchasing program, he added.
Figures on Monday showed that sight deposits at the SNB rose almost 8% last week. It was the largest increase since July 2013, indicating that the bank has been purchasing foreign currency in the market.
USD/CHF was down 0.49% to 0.8982, after rising as high as 0.9166 earlier.

The ruble fell to a six-week low after Standard & Poor's downgraded Russia’s sovereign debt to a junk rating. The move has worsened a selloff while fighting in the Ukraine has increased the chances for more Western sanctions.
S&P has issued a BB+ rating for the world’s largest energy exporter’s debt, or below investment grade. Oil prices fell by more than 50 percent in 2014, and the ratings agency said Russia is on its way toward a deep recession with projected annual growth of 0.5 percent for the next three years.
The U.S. and European Union have accused Russia of aiding rebels in eastern Ukraine, and say a rocket attack Saturday on the city of Mariupol could mean increased sanctions. S&P said the opportunities for Russia’s government and companies to service their debt were decreasing.
“In our view, the Russian Federation’s monetary policy flexibility has weakened, as have economic growth prospects,” S&P wrote, according to Bloomberg. “Stresses could mount for Russian corporations and banks that have foreign currency debt service requirements without a concomitant foreign currency revenue stream.”
Russia’s central bank will have to choose between propping up the ruble and aiding domestic banks this year, and S&P said the problem points toward an ominous 2015 for the country. The downgrade will force a investment-grade bond funds to sell Russian debt, fueling the selloff that began at the onset of the crisis in Ukraine and continued with the drop in oil prices.
Both Moody’s and Fitch downgraded Russian debt as well, but not to the level of junk bonds. Russia’s central bank does not formally recognize Western ratings, and Moscow has attempted to build a joint ratings agency with China to replace the three.

971,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 18, 2015 12:33PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/CHF weekly outlook: January 19 - 23,"Investing.com - The euro regained some ground against the Swiss franc on Friday after posting its largest ever one day decline against the franc in the previous session and hit fresh 12-year lows against the dollar amid prospects for monetary easing by the European Central Bank as early as this week.
The euro posted its largest ever single-day decline against the Swiss franc on Thursday after the Swiss National Bank abandoned its 1.20 per euro exchange rate cap that it imposed in September 2011.
SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan said Thursday the cap had “protected the Swiss economy from serious harm” but added that maintaining the policy was not “sustainable or sensible in the long term.”
“The euro has depreciated considerably against the U.S. dollar and this, in turn, has caused the Swiss franc to weaken against the U.S. dollar. In these circumstances, the SNB concluded that enforcing and maintaining the minimum exchange rate for the Swiss franc against the euro is no longer justified,” the central bank said.The central bank also cut interest rates deeper into negative territory, a move intended to dissuade investors from buying the franc.
The diverging monetary policy stance between the Federal Reserve, which is poised to raise interest rates and central banks in Europe and Japan, has seen the dollar strengthen broadly in recent months.
The surprise move indicated that the SNB is anticipating that the ECB will implement quantitative easing measures at its upcoming meeting on Thursday, in an attempt to spur inflation and growth in the euro area.
An interim ruling last Wednesday, which is likely to be accepted by the European Court of Justice, said the ECB was free to pursue a bond purchasing program without legal challenge.
EUR/CHF was trading at 0.9930 late Friday, up 1.75% for the day after falling to all-time lows of 0.8696 on Thursday. The pair still ended the week with losses of more than 17%.
USD/CHF was up 2.25% to 0.8586 late Friday, having recovered from the lows of 0.7360 struck in the previous session. The franc still ended the week with gains of 15% against the dollar.
EUR/USD was down 0.55% at 1.1567 in late trade on Friday, after falling to lows of 1.1461 earlier in the day, the weakest since November 2003.
In the week ahead, investors will be focusing on Thursday’s outcome of the ECB’s policy meeting and the banks post policy meeting press conference will be closely watched.

975,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2015 05:19AM ET</span>",FX broker FXCM gets rescue from Jefferies parent Leucadia,"Retail foreign exchange broker FXCM Inc. (NYSE:FXCM) reeling after customers lost more than $200 million from the surging Swiss franc, will get a $300 million loan from Leucadia National Corp (NYSE:LUK) to keep operating, the companies said in a statement Friday.
Large global banks and retail brokerages were hit hard by the Swiss National Bank's sudden move Thursday to scrap its three-year-old cap on the value of the Swiss franc against the euro (EUR/CHF).
FXCM said Thursday that client losses may have left the brokerage with too little capital.Leucadia, the parent of investment bank Jefferies, which advised on the deal, will invest $300 million in a two-year senior secured term loan with an initial coupon of 10 percent. The deal, which was expected to close Friday afternoon, also gives Leucadia an undisclosed percentage of a potential sale of FXCM.
""Leucadia`s support and this financing are by far the best alternative for FXCM, our customers, our shareholders, and all other relevant constituencies,"" said Drew Niv, FXCM chief executive officer.
Top executives from FXCM went through company books until at least 5 a.m. on Friday, according to a source close to FXCM. Regulators were in FXCM's offices in downtown Manhattan, according to two sources.
FXCM needed to act quickly. In its Thursday statement, the brokerage said client losses would result in a shortfall to the company of about $225 million and that it ""may be in breach of some regulatory capital requirements.""
""The key factor here is time, as regulators tend to be impatient once capital requirements are breached,"" analysts at Credit Suisse wrote in a Friday note.
In its statement, Richard Handler, Leucadia's CEO, and Brian Friedman, the firm's president, said they had worked with Jefferies and FXCM over the ""past approximately 36 hours"" to come to a deal. UBS acted as financial advisor to FXCM.
FXCM shares lost nearly 90 percent in premarket activity on Friday to $1.49 a share, and did not trade during the regular New York Stock Exchange trading session. The shares resumed trading in the after-hours session, recovering a bit from the premarket losses, but the stock (FXCM.K) was still down 70 percent to $3.81 a share from Thursday's close of $12.63.
Those who sold the stock in premarket action Friday morning will take big losses.""The fact is if you sold at $1.49 in premarket that’s a decision you made and you’re out of it,"" said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York.
Shares of Leucadia were halted during the trading day at $21.84 a share. They lost 0.8 percent to fall to $21.04 after resuming trading in after-hours action.In Washington, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said earlier that the agency was reviewing the company's situation but declined to give details.
FXCM and other brokerages were hit hard after the Swiss National Bank surprised markets by abandoning its cap against the euro. That caused the euro to suffer its biggest-ever one-day fall against the franc, dropping 18 percent for the session and losing some 30 percent on an intraday basis.
'BLACK SWAN' EVENT
Retail currency trade makes up nearly 4 percent of global daily spot turnover of nearly $2 trillion, the latest survey from the Bank of International Settlements shows, having grown from almost nothing in the 1990s.
In a note to clients, Sandler O'Neill analyst Richard Repetto wrote ""we've been informed that FXCM offered clients leverage of 50x (often the standard in the U.K.) for EUR/CHF (euro-Swiss franc) trades.""
""We believe this high leverage combined with the unique (black swan-like) event of the floating of the Swiss franc contributed to the steep customer losses at FXCM,"" he wrote.
Black swans are events seen as improbable and come as a major surprise to the market. Such events happen much more often than most market participants expect.
Shares of other brokers with retail foreign exchange businesses were mixed on Friday.
Interactive Brokers Group Inc (NASDAQ:IBKR) lost 0.6 percent to close at $28.09 a share. The company said customers lost $120 million beyond their collateral, equal to less than 2.5 percent of the company's net worth.
GAIN Capital Holding Inc (NYSE:GCAP) dropped as low as $7.75 in early trading but closed up 2.9 percent to $8.52, after the company said it generated a profit on Thursday from trading.

986,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2015 02:52PM ET</span>",Canada pushes back budget to April due to market instability,"By Scott Haggett
CALGARY (Reuters) - The Canadian government will unveil its budget this year later than it usually does, waiting at least until April because of market volatility, Finance Minister Joe Oliver said on Thursday.
""Given the current market instability, I will not bring forward our budget earlier than April. We need all the information we can obtain before finalizing our decisions,"" Oliver said in the text of a speech he was giving in Calgary.
The federal budget is usually introduced in February or March, occasionally as early as January, given the fiscal year starts on April 1. But lower oil prices have made it tricky to predict government revenues and what the economy will do.
Oil prices have more than halved from their peak last June, hit by rising production and weaker-than-expected demand in Europe and Asia.
""Given the current volatility, there is no consensus about how low will prices fall and how long will they stay there,"" Oliver said. ""Nevertheless, every knowledgeable person I have spoken to believes, and history tells us, that prices will eventually move well above current level.""
He said lower oil prices create both benefits and difficulties for the Canadian economy. Among the benefits are enhanced consumption and savings.
""Also, energy costs for manufacturing and transportation companies decline, along with the Canadian dollar, which makes these and other sectors more competitive,"" he said.
On the other hand oil company profits fall, their capital investment slows and employment declines, and federal and provincial tax revenues suffer, he noted.
Oliver told reporters that over the intermediate term, lower oil prices would have a broadly neutral impact on real, or inflation-adjusted, gross domestic product, but have a negative effect on nominal GDP, which influences tax revenues.
The Conservatives ran up a large budget deficit in the aftermath of the 2008-09 financial crisis and Oliver reiterated that they would get back to balance in 2015.

Oliver, who held the natural resources portfolio before he took over at Finance last year, said it was ""a matter of urgent national interest"" that Canada diversify its energy markets in a way that relies less on the United States, because of the shale boom which will reduce U.S. demand for Canadian oil.

992,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2015 07:30AM ET</span>",Swiss franc jumps 30 percent after Swiss National Bank dumps euro ceiling,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - Switzerland's franc soared by almost 30 percent in value against the euro on Thursday after the Swiss National Bank abandoned its three-year old cap at 1.20 francs per euro.
In a chaotic few minutes on markets after the SNB's announcement, the franc broke past parity against the euro to trade at 0.8052 francs per euro before trimming those gains to stand at 1.0350 francs.
It also gained 25 percent against the dollar to trade at 0.8900 francs per dollar.
The SNB has been resisting heavy pressure in recent months on the cap it imposed in September 2011 on the stellar rise seen in the franc's value due to investors seeking a haven from the euro zone's economic and political troubles. 
The prospect of outright money-printing by the European Central Bank as early as next week has added to the pressure, with the SNB seen by players in the market as buying euros consistently around 1.2009 francs per euro in recent days. 
""It has taken the market by complete surprise,"" said Jonathan Webb, head of FX strategy at Jefferies in London. 

""The SNB probably expects the ECB to launch QE next week and along with the Greek elections coming up, it would make it pretty tough on the Swiss to keep bidding the euro. So they have abandoned the cap and cut rates deeper into negative territory. We expect euro/Swiss to trade around 0.90-1.00 francs after all the stop loss orders have been cleared.""

The SNB surprised markets by scrapping the 1.20 per euro exchange rate floor it imposed in September 2011, in a bid to stave off deflation and prevent the continued appreciation of the safe-haven franc against the single currency. The central bank also cut rates to minus 0.75%, from minus 0.25% before.""This exceptional and temporary measure protected the Swiss economy from serious harm. While the Swiss franc is still high, the overvaluation has decreased as a whole since the introduction of the minimum exchange rate,"" the SNB said in statement.

1006,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 14, 2015 05:14AM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD hits fresh 9-year lows after ECJ ruling,"Investing.com - The euro fell to fresh nine-year lows against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday, after an interim ruling by the European Court of Justice cleared the way for the European Central Bank to implement quantitative easing measures.
EUR/USD hit 1.1727 during European morning trade, the pair's lowest since November 2005 and was last at 1.1759.
The drop in the euro came after the advocate general of the European Court of Justice, Pedro Cruz Villalon, advised judges to approve the ECB's Outright Monetary Transactions program, a measure which was launched in 2012, with conditions.
Villalon said the ECB must avoid any direct involvement in the financial assistance program that applies to the State concerned.
The ruling was seen as giving the ECB leeway at its upcoming policy meeting on January 22, when many expect it to implement full blown QE measures.Also Wednesday, data showed that euro zone industrial production rose 0.2% in November, in line with expectations, but factory output was down 0.4% on a year-over-year basis.
Meanwhile, oil was hit after the World Bank cut its forecasts for global growth on Tuesday, adding to fears over the faltering economic recovery. Oil prices continued to tumble on Wednesday after falling to almost six year lows in the previous session, after OPEC said it will not cut output despite a global supply glut.
The rout in oil, which has halved in value in six months, has fuelled concerns of exacerbating already low levels of inflation in many major world economies, including the euro zone.
Data last week showed that consumer prices in the euro area fell in December for the first time since October 2009.

Consumer prices were unchanged from a month earlier, compared to expectations for an uptick of 0.1%.
The report said inflation was flat in December due to falling gas and electricity costs. In addition, transport costs fell by 0.2% from a month earlier, due to falling petrol and diesel prices.
The slowdown in inflation underlined expectations that the Bank of England will keep interest rates on hold at record lows for most of this year.

1011,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 13, 2015 08:30PM ET</span>",Here’s Why The Euro Hit Another Record Low Today ,"By Kathleen Caulderwood - 

The euro hit a nine-year low against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday on investor fears that the European Central Bank will announce an aggressive stimulus plan next week in an effort to jump-start the lagging eurozone economy. An upcoming Greek election and sinking global oil prices haven’t helped, either. 
At a panel discussion in Vienna on Monday, Ewald Nowotny, a member of the European Central Bank Governing Council, said policymakers “shouldn’t wait too long with a reaction,” to the risk of deflation in the eurozone. By Tuesday night, the price of the euro dropped to $1.1754, its lowest rate since December 2005.
“People are just happy selling the euro going into the ECB meeting next week,” Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at BNP Paribas in New York, told Reuters. “Nowotny has been more dovish than we expected and he’s not really a dove,” he said.
Figures published Jan. 7 show that consumer prices in the euro region fell 0.2 percent, confirming fears that the region could experience deflation, which could cause a recession in the near future.
While ECB chief Mario Draghi has previously been optimistic about the eurozone hitting 2 percent inflation, data released earlier this month shows inflation rates in Germany, the strongest economy, were just 0.1 percent in December -- its weakest since 2009. Last week, Draghi acknowledged the likelihood that the bank will vote to start buying massive amounts of government bonds to help stave off deflation.
The tactic, known as quantitative easing, is one of the most powerful tools lawmakers have to affect economic change. While the move could be a boost for the economy, it will likely cause the euro to fall even further.
After hitting a high of $1.3996 in May of 2014, the euro has fallen 16 percent against the U.S. dollar. In a Tuesday research note, Deutsche Bank revised its forecast for the euro downward, predicting the rate would fall to $1.10, $1 and 90 cents in the next three years.
“The Euro has been pressured by several factors, including prospects of central-bank policy action and concerns regarding political developments in Greece,” Mizuho Bank Ltd. analyst Sireen Harajli told Bloomberg.
Alexis Tsipras, leader of the radical opposition party called Syriza, has promised to write off some of the country’s debt and fight back against strict conditions of a bailout. According to the Guardian, he is likely to win the popular vote when the country holds its national elections just days after the European Central Bank announces its decision next week."

1037,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 11, 2015 08:23AM ET</span>",Forex - USD/CAD weekly outlook: January 12 - 16,"Investing.com - The Canadian dollar fell to five-and-a-half year lows against the U.S. dollar on Friday after data showing Canada lost jobs for a second month in December, while the U.S. economy added more jobs that forecast.
USD/CAD hit highs of 1.1890, the most since May 2009, before pulling back to 1.1864 at the close. The pair ended the week with gains of 0.61%.
The drop in the Canadian dollar came after Statistics Canada reported that the economy shed 4,300 jobs last month after losing 10,700 in November. Economists had forecast jobs growth of 15,000. The unemployment rate remained steady at 6.6%.
Job losses were led by declines in part-time positions, which dropped by 57,700, Statistics Canada said, while full-time employment rose by 53,500.
The unexpectedly weak data indicated that the Bank of Canada is likely to keep interest rates on hold at 1%, where they have been since September 2010 for longer. The BoC is to hold its next monetary policy meeting on January 21.
At the same time, the Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy added 252,000 jobs last month, more than the 240,000 forecast by economists. 
The unemployment rate ticked down to a six-and-a-half year low 5.6% from 5.8% in November. Economists had forecast a decline to 5.7%.
Still, the report showed that average earnings fell by 0.2% in December, missing expectations for a 0.2% increase and were up by only 1.7% from a year earlier. 
The strong jobs report underlined the diverging economic recovery between the U.S. and Canada and did little to alter expectations that the Federal Reserve is on track to raise interest rates this year.
In the week ahead, the economic calendar is light, but markets will be looking ahead to Wednesday’s report on U.S. retail sales, as well as Friday’s data on consumer sentiment and factory output.

1038,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 11, 2015 06:20AM ET</span>",Forex - USD/JPY weekly outlook: January 12 - 16,"Investing.com - The dollar fell against the yen on Friday after the latest U.S. jobs report showed that average earnings fell last month, suggesting that the Federal Reserve could keep rates on hold for longer.
The U.S. economy added 252,000 jobs in December the Labor Department said, more than the 240,000 forecast by economists. The unemployment rate ticked down to a six-and-a-half year low 5.6% from 5.8% in November. Economists had forecast a decline to 5.7%.
However, the report also showed that average earnings fell by 0.2% in December, missing expectations for a 0.2% increase and were up by just 1.7% from a year earlier.
The drop in average earnings prompted investors to take profits in the dollar, as markets pushed back expectations for the first hike in U.S. interest rates to late-2015 from mid-2015 before the report.
Following an initial move higher the dollar fell against the yen, with USD/JPY down 0.99% to 118.46 late Friday. The pair ended the week down 1.6%.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.39% to 92.18 late Friday, off the 12-year peaks of 92.76 reached in the previous session. The index still notched up a weekly gain, supported by weakness in the euro.
The euro ended the week at more than two-month lows against the yen, with EUR/JPY down 0.57% to 140.32 in late trade, the weakest since October 31.
In the euro zone, data on Friday showed that industrial output fell in both Germany and France in November, while German exports also fell. The weak data fuelled speculation that the European Central Bank will embark on full blown quantitative easing as soon as its next meeting on January 22.
Earlier in the week, data showed that consumer prices in the euro area fell in December for the first time in more than five years, adding to pressure on the ECB to step up measures to avert the threat of deflation taking hold in the region.
The single currency was also pressured lower by uncertainty over Greece’s future in the euro zone if far-left anti-austerity party Syriza win elections due to be held later this month.
In the week ahead, the economic calendar is light, but markets will be looking ahead to Wednesday’s report on U.S. retail sales, as well as Friday’s data on consumer sentiment and factory output.

1058,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2015 10:40AM ET</span>",Euro slide not over as pressure grows on ECB: Reuters poll,"By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro's slide is not yet over because diverging monetary policies at the European Central Bank and the United States Federal Reserve will sink the currency to levels not seen since late 2003, a Reuters poll found.
Fears that cheap oil will tip the now 19-member bloc into a deflationary spiral have increased calls for the ECB to take urgent action, possibly as soon as the Governing Council's Jan. 22 meeting.
Conversely, the Fed is widely expected to begin tightening its policy later this year given robust job gains and bullish growth signs in the world's biggest economy. [FED/R]
""We have the existing disparity between ECB policy and Fed policy. Certainly quantitative easing is priced in to a large extent but not fully,"" said Jane Foley at Rabobank, the most accurate 12-month euro forecaster in Reuters polls last year.
The euro <EUR/USD> lost around 13 percent against the dollar last year and sank to a nine-year low of $1.184 on Wednesday amid gloomy economic data and renewed fears of a Greek exit that could bring the monetary union to its knees.
""Political risk is potentially the new factor for 2015 and not just with Greece ... the risk could be extended as we go into Spanish and Portuguese elections too,"" Foley said.
According to the poll of over 50 foreign exchange strategists, the euro will rally to $1.20 in a month then fall back to $1.18 in six months. But at the end of this year it will sit at $1.15, a level not seen since late 2003.
Nearly all those forecasts were taken before official data showed inflation fell more than expected to -0.2 percent in December. But already they were far weaker than in a poll last month when the respective forecasts were $1.24, $1.20 and $1.18.
Central banks themselves are growing more wary of the euro, the second-biggest reserve currency after the dollar.
The share of currency reserves in the euro held by central banks fell to its lowest in over a decade in the third quarter of 2014 at less than 23 percent, according to International Monetary Fund data.
LOOSE CABLE
Sterling (EURGBP=) will also gain ground on the euro in the year ahead, the poll predicts.
It concluded you will need 78.2 pence to get one euro in a month, 77.1p in six months and just 76.0p in a year. Last month the respective forecasts were 79.1p, 77.4p and 76.5p.
Like the Fed, the Bank of England is expected to begin raising interest rates from record lows later this year, although a recent bout of weaker British data and falling inflation have called the timing into doubt and the pound <GBP=> will struggle against the dollar. [ECILT/GB]
Cable, trading around $1.51 earlier on Wednesday, was predicted to be at $1.53 in a month, $1.52 in six and $1.51 in 12. The December poll was much more bullish about sterling with respective $1.57, $1.55 and $1.54 forecasts.
Speculators renewed their net long dollar position at the end of last year, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed, suggesting they also expect it to strengthen.
Dollar strength -- it ended 2014 with a gain of nearly 13 percent against a basket of major currencies -- will also keep weakening the Japanese yen <USD/JPY>, to 123.0 in six months and 125.0 in a year.
The yen, trading at 119.2 on Wednesday, lost over 14 percent last year and with the Bank of Japan likely to ease policy further some time after June, any strengthening this year looks unlikely.

Emerging market currencies will also stay under pressure, though they may not fall as much as last year: lower commodity prices and tighter U.S. monetary policy could already be largely priced in. [BRL/POLL] [CEEU/[POLL]

1059,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2015 10:40AM ET</span>",Emerging currencies face bumpy year but much already priced in: Reuters poll,"By Silvio Cascione
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Emerging market currencies will stay under pressure in 2015, a Reuters poll found, though they may not fall as much as last year as lower commodity prices and tighter monetary policy in the United States could be largely priced in already.
All major emerging market currencies except the Mexican peso <MXN=> are set to drop further this year, according to the median views of more than 80 strategists and economists polled.
The Brazilian real <BRL=>, the Turkish lira <TRY=> and the South African rand <ZAR=>, which plunged near or more than 10 percent to decade-lows in 2014, are expected to slide 1-5 percent through 2015.
The median forecast for the Russian rouble <RUB=>, caught in the middle of a capital flight crisis, is pegged at stronger than its current level, but the most pessimistic estimate has it falling another 30 percent.
""The dichotomy between the monetary policy stances in the U.S. and UK and those in Europe and Japan, coupled with falling commodity prices and a weaker Chinese growth and activity outlook, makes for a rather lethal cocktail for emerging-market currency risk,"" said Jeffrey Schultz, an economist with BNP Paribas Cadiz Securities in Johannesburg.
The problem is the list of potential risks is not new. Oil, for example, has plummeted more than 50 percent since mid-2014 and may bottom out before year-end, and the Federal Reserve has telegraphed expected 2015 rate hikes.
For some analysts, the risk that emerging market currencies actually strengthen later this year is higher than in 2014, especially if the Fed tightens monetary policy too slowly.
""People will realize it would not be the end of the world, and then the currencies will regain some ground,"" said Cristiano Oliveira, an economist with Banco Fibra in Sao Paulo.
Herd mentality will not take traders too far either, analysts say.
Although the forecasts suggest an uniform impact across emerging market currencies, Brazil, Turkey and Mexico, to name a few examples, differ on their exposure to lower oil prices and on their intervention in currency markets.
In Turkey, a net oil importer, cheaper fuel may help hold the currency around current levels through the first half of the year, according to the poll, whereas in oil-producing Mexico the effect should be the opposite.
Both countries have also stepped up market intervention recently, unlike Brazil, which has reduced currency swap sales recently to keep some powder dry.
Monetary policy should also help some emerging currencies outperfom others.
With the exception of Indonesia, Russia and Brazil, central banks are with a bias to ease in 2015 as global growth sputters, according to strategists at Brown Brothers Harriman.
In some countries such as Chile, policymakers will face a difficult choice: they may want to cut rates to stimulate their economies, but could fear renewed currency weakness.

Core inflation, which strips out volatile measures such as food and energy costs, rose 0.8% on a year-over-year basis, but was still well below the ECB's target of close to, but just under 2%.

1083,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 05, 2015 03:01PM ET</span>",What’s Going On With The Euro? ,"By Kathleen Caulderwood - The euro is at a nine-year low, but it’s not exactly a crisis for everyone. On Monday, the eurozone currency fell 1.2 percent against the U.S. dollar to hit $1.19, its lowest rate since March 2006.
Although some economists are concerned that fresh rumors of a Greek exit -- or “Grexit”-- from the eurozone are driving the currency downward, most experts say the euro’s most recent slide is due to the combination of a strong U.S. dollar and an upcoming decision from the European Central Bank on whether to begin a round of economic stimulus.
In spite of the panic, many businesses, as well as some budget-conscious tourists, stand to gain. European companies exporting goods and services abroad will now have a major advantage over their American counterparts, since Europeans can offer lower prices for comparable items.
Tourism in Europe is likely to see a major boost, too. “If you’re a tourist and you want to visit Europe it’s going to be a great time to do it,” Bert Colijn, senior economist at the Conference Board, a think-tank, said.
But as with most economic issues, not everyone can win. Sharp currency moves always provoke questions, says David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institute. One of the most important queries: Where is demand likely to increase or decrease?
“If Europe is effectively reducing the value of its currency so it can export a little more, at the expense of the rest of the world, that’s probably not a good thing for the world economy,” he said.
The boost in the U.S. dollar will also make for a difficult situation in emerging markets, which could have trouble paying debts that are now more expensive. “It’s never just one thing,” Wessel said. “It’s never just black or white.”
The euro is likely to stay weak for a while. One of the most important factors is a high likelihood that the European Central Bank will soon implement a stimulus plan, known as quantitative easing, to boost the region’s lagging economy.
“One of the reasons why the ECB has started to talk about quantitative easing is to bring the exchange rate down,” Colijn said.
In the later part of 2014, ECB chief Mario Draghi discussed the possibility that the bank would begin purchasing government bonds, its most powerful economic tool. Unlike the U.S. Federal Reserve, which focuses on maintaining low rates of inflation and unemployment, the primary concern of the ECB is inflation. The ECB’s mandate is to keep inflation at just under 2 percent, but real rates are however far below that target. Germany, the largest economy in the region, said on Monday that its inflation rate slowed to just 0.1 percent in December, lower than analyst expectations of 0.2 percent, according to Bloomberg.
Bank officials will meet on January 22 to make the decision."

1121,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2014 05:25PM ET</span>",Russia forecasts economic slump as bailed-out bank gets more funds,"By Darya Korsunskaya and Vladimir Abramov 
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Slumping oil prices have put Russia's economy on course for a sharp recession and double-digit inflation next year, government ministers said on Friday, as authorities scaled up a bailout for the first bank to succumb to this month's ruble crisis. 
The economy is slowing sharply as Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis deter foreign investment and spur capital flight, and as a slump in oil prices severely reduces Russia's export revenues and pummels the ruble. 
The government has taken steps to support key banks and address the deepening currency crisis in the past week, including a sharp and unexpected interest rate hike, but analysts are pessimistic on the outlook for both the economy and the ruble. 
Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told journalists on Friday the economy could shrink by 4 percent in 2015, its first contraction since 2009, if oil prices averaged their current level of $60 a barrel. 
Siluanov also said the country would run a budget deficit of more than 3 percent next year if the oil price did not rise. 
""Next year we will, without doubt, have to bring the Reserve Fund into play,"" he said, referring to one of Russia's two rainy-day funds intended to support the economy at times of crisis. 
Crude prices have almost halved from their June peak amid a global glut and a decision by producer group OPEC not to cut output. Saudi Arabia said on Friday it was prepared to withstand a prolonged period of low prices. 
""We need to have our budget break even at $70 per barrel by 2017,"" said Siluanov. 
Russia's government imposed informal capital controls this week, including orders to large state-controlled oil and gas exporters Gazprom and Rosneft to sell some of their dollar revenues to shore up the ruble. 
Russians have kept a wary eye on the exchange rate since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Hyper-inflation wiped out their savings over several years in the early 1990s and the ruble collapsed again in 1998. 
The ruble's latest fall will inevitably lead to higher inflation next year, which after years of stability threatens President Vladimir Putin's reputation for ensuring Russia's prosperity. 
""The inflation forecast is tough, high. We forecast the level of 10 percent at the end of the year (2015),"" Russian Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev said on Friday. 
Inflation would remain in double digits throughout 2015, peaking at the end of the first quarter or in the second quarter, he added. 
ROUBLE TROUBLE 
The Russian currency slipped on Friday after hitting its strongest levels in more than three weeks earlier in the day. 
The ruble traded at 53.9 per dollar during the evening, a sharp rebound from its recent all-time lows of 80 but still far weaker than the 30-35 range it was trading at in the first half of 2014. 
""If oil goes down to $50 (per barrel)... I don't think our authorities will be able to artificially maintain the (ruble) rate even with higher sales by exporters,"" said the head of treasury at a major Russian bank, who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to media. 
On Friday, Russian authorities also significantly scaled up rescue funds for Trust Bank, saying they would provide up to $2.4 billion in loans to bail out the mid-sized lender, the first bank to fall victim to the crisis. 
The falling ruble has prompted panic buying of foreign currency in Russia and a spike in deposit withdrawals, heaping pressure on a vulnerable banking sector whose access to international capital markets has already been restricted by Western sanctions. 
Siluanov said on Friday that authorities would provide additional capital to the country's second-largest bank, VTB, and fellow state lender Gazprombank. 
VTB could receive 250 billion rubles and Gazprombank 70 billion rubles to help fund investment projects, including those planned by Russian Railways, he said. 
It was not clear whether this support would be in addition to the 1 trillion ruble capital boost the banking sector is set to receive as part of legislation recently approved by parliament. 
Credit agency Standard & Poor's said this week it could downgrade Russia's rating to junk as soon as January due to a rapid deterioration in ""monetary flexibility"" in the country. 
""Practically this (a downgrade) may mean the increase of capital outflow from Russia, which would be necessary to replace with instruments we have,"" Ulyukayev said. 
Russia may repurchase corporate bond issues, especially denominated in foreign currency, if needed, he added. 

Meanwhile Russian gold and forex reserves have fallen to their lowest levels since 2009 as the central bank has spent billions to prop up the currency. Last week, reserves dropped by as much as $15.7 billion to below $400 billion, down from over $510 billion at the start of the year.

1180,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2014 12:58PM ET</span>",Russian rouble suffers steepest drop in 16 years,"By Alexander Winning and Vladimir Abramov 
MOSCOW (Reuters) - The rouble plunged more than 11 percent against the dollar on Tuesday in its steepest intraday fall since the Russian financial crisis in 1998 as confidence in the central bank evaporated after an ineffectual rate hike. 
The rouble opened around 10 percent stronger against the dollar after the central bank unexpectedly raised its benchmark interest rate by a hefty 650 basis points to try and halt the currency's slide, but it reversed gains in volatile trade and repeatedly set new record lows. 
It has now fallen close to 20 percent this week, taking its losses this year against the dollar to more than 50 percent and stirring memories of the 1998 crisis when the currency collapsed within a matter of days, forcing Russia to default on its debt. 
Although Russia's public finances and reserves are much healthier than in 1998, analysts say the country is on the brink of a full-blown currency crisis. 
At 10:10 a.m. ET, the rouble was down around 11 percent against the dollar at 72.80  after earlier racing past 80 roubles per dollar for the first time to be down around 20 percent at one stage from the previous close. 
Against the euro, it was more than 13 percent weaker at 91.00 . 
The rouble has been hammered by the slump in oil prices and Western sanctions imposed over Russia's involvement in Ukraine, but its sharp decline over the past two days also reflects declining confidence in the central bank. 
The 650-basis-point rate hike, less than a week after another 100-basis-point rise, was seen as a sign of desperation by the bank, whose Governor Elvira Nabiullina now appears powerless to stop the currency's slide, raising the risk of capital controls. 
The market ignored Nabiullina's comments on Tuesday that the rouble was undervalued, as well as comments by Putin's spokesman that the rouble fall was driven largely by a speculative mood. 
INTERVENTIONS 
The central bank's First Deputy Governor Sergei Shvetsov said the bank would implement more measures to stabilize the currency market, calling the situation ""critical"". 
""If such an interest rate rise didn't impress the market, then they (the central bank) have left the option of interventions of $10 billion a day. They are in (the market) every day,"" said Natalia Orlova, chief economist at Alfa Bank. 
Investors were also unnerved by the prospect that Russian oil major Rosneft (MM:ROSN), which recently issued 625 billion roubles ($8.67 billion) in bonds, could convert the funds into foreign currency, adding further pressure on the rouble. 
Rosneft has said the money will not be used to buy foreign currency. 
Russia's dollar-denominated RTS share index (IRTS) was down as much as 19 percent at one point, extending heavy losses from Monday, and shares in top bank Sberbank (MM:SBER) - seen as a barometer for the wider economy - plunged more than 20 percent. 
Russian sovereign dollar bonds fell and money market rates jumped. 
President Vladimir Putin has blamed both the slide in oil and the rouble on speculators and the West. A weak rouble poses a major test for Putin, since his popularity in part depends on his reputation for guaranteeing prosperity and stability, and it stokes inflation. 
""The central bank will have a very hard time stabilizing the rouble as long as the sharp sell-off in oil prices continues,"" Vladimir Miklashevsky, an economist at Danske Bank, said in a note. 
Brent crude prices  fell below $60 on Tuesday for the first time since July 2009, hurting the outlook for Russia's oil-dependent economy, which the central bank says is likely to contract early next year.  
The central bank has spent more than $80 billion defending the rouble this year, including more than $8 billion since it floated the currency in November. 
Russia still has ample reserves of around $416 billion but analysts say the currency is in dangerous territory as it is increasingly being driven down by sheer panic. 
""What now rules the Russian currency is not oil, or even waiting for it to move, but panic fueled by a large number of rumors about the return of our country to the ""98-year"" regime,"" said Alena Afanasyeva, a senior analyst at Forex Club in Moscow, referring to the 1998 crisis.

USD/RUB advanced 3.00% to 59.97, up from 58.21 late Friday.
The drop in the ruble came after the U.S. Congress on Friday approved tougher sanctions on Moscow and authorized the supply of military aid to Ukraine.
U.S. President Barack Obama has not yet signed the bill into law and has said it would be ""counterproductive"" for Washington to ""get out ahead of Europe further"" on sanctions.
The ruble found some support from a rebound in oil prices after they dropped to five-and-a-half year lows earlier in the session.
Brent crude was up more than 1% at $62.83 a barrel in afternoon trading in Moscow. Oil is one of Russia’s main exports.
Russia's central bank said on Monday it had conducted $478 million worth of foreign exchange market interventions on December 11, bringing the total amount of reserves spent propping up the currency this month to nearly $6 billion.
The central bank hiked interest rates by 1% last Thursday in a bid to defend the currency and stem spiraling inflation, to little effect.
The bank warned that inflation could exceed 10% in the first quarter of 2015 and also cut its growth forecasts for 2015 and 2016 to almost zero. It said it would continue to raise interest rates to curb rising inflation.
A combination of lower oil prices and western sanctions have weakened the ruble, caused a spike in inflation and almost completely shut Russian companies out of the global financial markets.
Elsewhere, the ruble hit record lows against the euro, with EUR/RUB up 3.58% to 75.13.

The Nikkei fell more than 1% overnight following a win for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in re-elections in Sunday, a sign of support for his economic reforms, which call for a weaker yen.
Market sentiment was also hit by concerns over the economic impact of the continuing rout in oil prices and its effect on energy companies. Data late last week showing further signs of a slowdown in China added to fears over the global economic outlook.
Investors also remained wary ahead of Wednesday’s upcoming Fed meeting, as ongoing speculation over the prospects for a U.S. rate hike next year fuelled expectations that the U.S. central bank could adjust its forward guidance.

The move raised the prospect of snap elections if Prime Minister Antonis Samaras’ candidate is not approved by parliament, which could see the anti-bailout Syriza party take power.

USD/RUB was up 0.75% to 55.28 from around 55.03 ahead of the decision.
The Central Bank of the Russian Federation raised borrowing costs to 10.5% from 9.5%, which was broadly in line with expectations.

The annual rate of inflation in Russia rose to 9.1% in November despite a series of rate hikes earlier this year.
The ruble has lost 40% of its value against the dollar so far this year, the worst decline since the currency crisis of 1998.
A combination of lower prices for oil, Russia’s main export and western sanctions have weakened the ruble, caused a spike in inflation and almost completely shut Russian companies out of the global financial markets.

The Canadian unemployment rate ticked up to 6.6% from 6.5% in October, in line with expectations.

The Markit U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers’ index ticked down to 54.8 in November from 55.9 in October. Economists had forecast a decline to 55.0.
Meanwhile in the U.S., the Institute of Supply Management reported earlier that its manufacturing PMI dipped to 58.7 from 59.0 in October, though still better than expectations of 57.9, though the dollar slid on profit taking anyway.
Losses were seen as limited, as any reading over 50 signifies expansion.
The yen rose on demand from bottom fishers after falling on news that Moody’s downgraded Japan's sovereign debt rating by one notch to A1, citing “heightened uncertainty” over Japan’s ability to cut its fiscal deficit following a decision by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to delay a planned sales tax hike.
""Fiscal consolidation will become increasingly difficult to achieve as time passes given rising government spending, particularly for social programs associated with a rapidly ageing population,"" the rating agency said.

In the euro zone, data on Friday showed that the annual rate of inflation slowed to a five year low of 0.3% in November. The weak data was seen as increasing the likelihood that the European Central Bank will implement quantitative easing measures.

The selloff in oil overshadowed data Friday showing that Canada’s gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 2.8% in the third quarter as exports rose 2.2%. Economists had forecast third quarter growth of 2.1%.
Demand for the dollar continued to be underpinned by expectations that the Federal Reserve is moving closer to raising interest rates, as central banks in Japan and the euro zone are easing monetary policy to spur growth and stave off the threat of deflation.
In the week ahead investors will be focusing on the outcome of a policy meeting of the ECB on Thursday, which is to be followed by the U.S. jobs report for November on Friday. Central banks in the U.K., Canada and Australia are also to hold policy setting meetings next week.

1365,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 30, 2014 11:41AM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD weekly outlook: December 1 - 5,"Investing.com - The euro ended the day lower against the dollar on Friday after data showed that euro zone inflation slowed to five year low this month and tumbling oil prices fuelled concerns over the outlook for the global economic recovery.
EUR/USD dipped 0.11% to 1.2451 late Friday, closing in on Monday’s two year lows of 1.2359. 
Eurostat reported that the annual rate of euro area inflation slowed to a five year low of 0.3% this month, down from 0.4% in October.
The report said that falling energy prices were the main factor pressuring inflation lower. Energy prices have fallen 2.5% on a year-over-year basis and look likely to continue to drop in the wake of Thursday’s decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries not to cut output quotas.
The move fuelled a broad based selloff in oil prices and added to fears over the impact of growing deflationary pressures on the global economic recovery.
The weak inflation data was seen as increasing the likelihood that the European Central Bank will implement quantitative easing measures in a bid to spur growth and stave off the threat of deflation. 
A separate report showed that the rate of unemployment in the euro area was unchanged at 11.5% last month.
The US dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.45% to 88.41 late Friday, not far from the four-year highs of 88.52 set on Monday.
Elsewhere, the euro gained ground against the yen and the pound, with EUR/JPY up 0.65% to 147.66 and EUR/GBP rising 0.46% to 0.7958 in late trade.
The yen has weakened broadly since the Bank of Japan unexpectedly expanded its stimulus program on October 31.
Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe dissolved parliament earlier this month, clearing the way for elections to be held on December 15 to seek a fresh mandate for his economic policies, which call for a weaker yen. The decision came after data showing that Japan’s economy unexpectedly fell into recession in the third quarter.

In U.S. trading, USD/JPY was up 0.72% at 117.71, up from a session low of 116.82 and off a high of 117.78.
The pair was expected to test support at 115.44, Monday's low, and resistance at 117.78, the session high.
Investors were looking ahead to the minutes of the Fed’s October meeting, which were expected to highlight the growing monetary policy divergence between the U.S. central bank and its peers in Japan and Europe.
The Fed’s October policy statement noted that both the labor market and the inflation outlook were improving.
Markets are currently expecting the U.S. central bank to start raising rates sometime around September 2015. In contrast, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank are expected to continue monetary easing in order to shore up growth and inflation.
The yen remained under heavy selling pressure one day after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced plans to delay a sales tax hike due to take place next year after an increase in April played a part in pulling Japan into a recession.
He also called elections for December to seek a fresh mandate for his economic policies, which call for a weaker yen.
The decision came after data revealed that Japan’s economy fell back into recession in the third quarter, contracting by an annualized 1.6% after a 7.3% contraction in the previous quarter.
The yen showed little reaction after the Bank of Japan left monetary policy on hold on Wednesday, as widely anticipated.

1520,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 16, 2014 06:33AM ET</span>",Forex - USD/JPY weekly outlook: November 17 - 21,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar hit fresh seven-year highs against the yen on Friday after upbeat data on U.S. retail sales boosted the outlook for the economic recovery.
USD/JPY rose to 116.82, the most since October 2007, before pulling back to 116.28 in late trade, up 0.44% for the day. For the week, the pair advanced 1.53%.
The dollar was boosted after the Commerce Department reported that U.S. retail sales rose 0.3% in October, ahead of forecasts for a 0.2% increase.
The greenback trimmed gains after separate data showed that U.S. inflation expectations fell in an otherwise upbeat report on consumer confidence for this month.
The preliminary reading of the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index rose to a seven year high of 89.4, better than forecasts of 87.5 and up from October’s reading of 86.9.
However, the report also showed that consumers expected annual inflation of 2.6% this year, down from expectations for inflation of 2.9% in October.
The US dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.25% to 87.61 in late trade, not far from the more than four-year highs of 88.36 hit earlier in the session.
The yen came under renewed selling pressure earlier week amid speculation that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe could call a snap election in December. A win for Abe would indicate continued support for his for his economic and fiscal policies, which call for a weaker yen.
Speculation that the prime minister could postpone a proposed sales tax increase, scheduled for October 2015 also curbed investor demand for the currency.
Last month, the BoJ boosted its quantitative easing program in a bid to combat slowing growth and inflation, weakening the yen across the board.
In the week ahead, investors will be focusing on Wednesday’s minutes of the Federal Reserve’s October meeting and Thursday’s report on the U.S. consumer price index. Monday’s data on third quarter growth from Japan and Wednesday’s policy announcement by the BoJ will also be closely watched.

In U.S. trading on Thursday, EUR/USD was up 0.42% at 1.2528.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's preliminary reading on the overall consumer sentiment index for November hit 89.4, its highest reading since July 2007, beating forecasts for an 87.5 reading.
Also in the U.S., the Census Bureau reported that U.S. retail sales rose 0.3% last month, exceeding expectations for a 0.2% gain, after a 0.3% fall in September.
Core retail sales, which exclude volatile transportation items, increased by 0.3% in October, compared to expectations for a 0.2% slip the previous month.
Friday's data bolstered expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in 2015, and gave the greenback the edge over the euro earlier, though the single currency bounced back after investors digested upbeat euro area growth figures.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical office, reported earlier that euro area's gross domestic product rose 0.2% in the third quarter from the second, more than the expected 0.1% uptick.
The bloc's economy expanded at an annual rate of 0.8% in the third quarter, compared to expectations for 0.7% growth.
Earlier Friday, a preliminary report showed that Germany's GDP rose 0.1% in the last quarter, in line with expectations, after a revised 0.1% contraction in the three months to June.

Elsewhere in Europe Eurostat reported that inflation came in flat in October, in line with market expectations, after a 0.4% rise in September.
The bloc's annual rate of inflation remained unchanged at 0.4% last month, also in line with expectations.
Core CPI in the euro zone, which excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco, ticked down to an annual rate of 0.7% last month from 0.8% in September.
The data fueled further concerns over persistently low levels of inflation in the euro area. The European Central Bank targets an inflation rate of close to, but just below 2%, though Friday's growth rate eclipsed inflation data, seen by many as already priced into trading.
The dollar was up against the yen, with USD/JPY up 0.44% at 116.29, and down against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF down 0.49% at 0.9589.
The yen continued to come under broad selling pressure amid mounting speculation that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe could call a snap election in December, which would allow him to better push through his reforms, which call for a weaker Japanese currency to spur growth.
The greenback was up against the pound, with GBP/USD down 0.21% at 1.5678.
The dollar was down against its cousins in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, with USD/CAD down 0.83% at 1.1275, AUD/USD up 0.46% at 0.8757 and NZD/USD up 0.37% at 0.7910.

USD/RUB was up 1.61% to 49.91 after falling to lows of 44.95 on Monday.
On Monday, the Bank of Russia said it was abandoning the rouble’s trading band and would allow the exchange rate to float freely. The bank added that it would intervene in the foreign exchange market at any time if it saw any threat to financial stability.
The bank also announced plans to limit domestic rouble liquidity in a bid to discourage domestic investors from betting against the currency.The measures will protect the bank's reserves by eliminating the trading corridor it had set for the rouble and the regular interventions it staged in a bid to stem the depreciation of the currency.
The rouble found additional support after Russia President Vladimir Putin dismissed the recent steep decline in the currency as “speculative”.
The rouble rallied against the dollar and the euro following the announcement, with USD/RUB pulling further back from the record high of 48.61 hit last Thursday, and EUR/RUB moving away from Thursday’s all-time highs of 60.27.
The euro gained 1.11% against the rouble on Tuesday, rising to 57.85.
The rouble has come under heavy selling pressure this year, pressured lower by ongoing tensions in eastern Ukraine and broad based risk aversion towards Russia, as well the falling price of oil, Russia’s main export.
Sanctions imposed on Russia by the U.S. and the European Union for what they say is its role in backing separatists in eastern Ukraine have weakened the rouble, caused a spike in inflation and have almost completely shut Russian companies out of the global financial markets.
Russia’s central bank also cut its forecast for economic growth this year on Monday and warned that it expected sanctions to remain in place until 2017. However, it still expects the economy to avoid a deep recession even if oil prices continue to slide.

The US dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.13% to 88.00, not far from Friday’s four-and-a-half year peaks of 88.31.
The dollar slid in the previous two sessions after Friday’s softer than expected U.S. jobs report prompted a bout of profit taking to lock in gains after the greenbacks recent run higher.
The dollar has rallied over the past two months as broadly stronger economic data fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates sometime in 2015.
In contrast, central banks in Japan and the euro zone are likely to stick to a looser monetary policy stance in a bid to spur growth and inflation.
USD/JPY hit fresh seven year highs of 116.10, and was last up 0.90% to 115.87.
The yen fell as speculation that Japan’s government may postpone a planned sales tax increase boosted risk appetite and fuelled strong gains in Asian equities overnight, curbing safe haven demand for the currency.
Data on Tuesday showing that Japan posted an unexpectedly large current account surplus of ¥963 billion in September, boosted by the weaker yen, also supported risk appetite.
EUR/USD was little changed at 1.2425, not far from last Friday’s 26-month lows of 1.2356.
Elsewhere, the dollar was lower against the pound, with GBP/USD rising 0.18% to 1.5868, while USD/CHF edged down to 0.9675.

Also Tuesday, the Russian rouble fell against the dollar, reversing a rally one day after the country’s central bank said it had abandoned the rouble’s trading corridor and would allow the currency to float freely.
The rouble has fallen sharply this year, pressured lower by a combination of sanctions imposed on Russia by the West over the crisis in eastern Ukraine and steep declines in global oil prices.

1588,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2014 09:20AM ET</span>","Russian central bank abandons rouble trading band, floats rouble","MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian central bank said on Monday it had abandoned the rouble's trading corridor, allowing the currency to float freely.
The rouble has slumped nearly 30 percent against the dollar this year as plunging oil prices and Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis reduced Russia's exports and investment inflows.
At 0425 EDT, the rouble was 2.8 percent stronger versus the dollar on the day <RUBUTSTN=MCX> and 2.6 percent firmer against the euro .
The central bank says it will allow the rouble to trade freely as of next year. It had kept the rouble in a nine-rouble trading band against a dollar-euro basket <RUS=MCX>, gradually limiting its foreign markets interventions.
The central bank said in a statement it would intervene in the foreign currency market if it saw a threat to financial stability.
""As a result of the decision, the rouble's rate will be formed by market factors that should strengthen the effectiveness of the central bank's monetary policy,"" it said in the statement.

The bank's governor, Elvira Nabiullina, said on Monday the bank would temporarily limit the amount of rouble liquidity it provides to Russian banks because of what it called speculative operations against the rouble.

USD/RUB was down 3.49% to 45.06, off the record high of 48.61 struck last Thursday.
In a statement, Russia’s central bank said Monday that it had abandoned the rouble’s trading band and would allow the currency to float freely.
The bank added that it would intervene in the foreign exchange market at any time if it saw any threat to financial stability.
The announcement came after the central bank scaled back interventions aimed at supporting the rouble last week.
The central bank hiked interest rates by 1.5% to 9.5% earlier this month in an effort to stem the depreciation of the ruble and curb inflation.
The rouble has fallen by around 25% against the dollar so far this year as ongoing tensions in eastern Ukraine and broad based risk aversion towards Russia, as well as falling oil prices pressured the currency lower.
Sanctions imposed on Russia by the U.S. and the European Union for what they say is its role in backing separatists in eastern Ukraine have weakened the rouble, caused a spike in inflation and have almost completely shut Russian companies out of the global financial markets.
At the same time, the country’s economy has been hit by falling oil prices. Russia is the world’s second-largest oil exporter and half of its budget revenue is financed by taxes on energy exports.
Elsewhere, EUR/RUB dropped 3.03% to 56.34, retreating from Thursday’s all-time highs of 60.27.

Italian industrial output was down 1.1% in the third quarter, accelerating from a 0.5% decline in the three months to June. It was the largest decline since the last three months of 2012.
The report fuelled fears that the steep decline will drag down third quarter growth after the economy contracted by 0.2% in the second quarter.
A separate report showed that the Sentix index of euro zone investor confidence improved modestly this month, but remained close to 18 month lows.
Research group Sentix said its index of investor confidence improved to minus 11.9 this month, from minus13.7 in October, which was the lowest since May 2013.

The Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy added 214,000 jobs in October, missing expectations for jobs growth of 231,000. 
September’s figure was revised up to 256,000 from a previously reported 248,000 and August’s figure was also revised up to 203,000 from 180,000, pointing to underlying strength in the labor market.
The U.S. unemployment rate ticked down to a fresh six-year low of 5.8% from 5.9% in September.
The data prompted investors to sell the dollar to lock in gains following its recent rally but did little to alter expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates ahead of its other major peers.
The US dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.63% to 87.66, off the four-and-a-half year peaks of 88.31 hit earlier in the session.
A day earlier the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee voted to leave U.K. interest rates at their current record lows of 0.5%, in a widely anticipated decision.
The pound remained under pressure after surveys of the U.K. service and manufacturing sectors released earlier in week added to worries that the rate of the economic recovery is slowing.
Elsewhere, sterling was lower against the euro on Friday, with EUR/GBP advancing 0.44% to 0.7848, recovering from Thursday’s five week lows of 0.7798.
The single currency weakened after the European Central Bank reiterated its pledge on Thursday to implement further stimulus measures if needed to combat persistently low levels of inflation in the euro area.
In the week ahead, Thursday’s inflation report from the BoE will closely watched amid fears that the recovery is moderating, while investors will also be looking ahead to Friday’s reports on U.S. retail sales and consumer confidence.Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.

From next year the BoJ will increase its balance sheet by 15% of gross domestic product per year and will extend the average duration of its bond purchases from seven years to 10 years.

Diverging monetary policies have sent the U.S. currency strengthening to four-year highs against its peers in recent sessions.
In U.S. trading on Friday, EUR/USD was up 0.52% at 1.2436.
The Department of Labor reported earlier that the U.S. economy added 214,000 jobs in October, missing expectations for an increase of 231,000. The number of jobs added in September was revised to 256,000 from a previously estimated 248,000.
The report also revealed that the U.S. unemployment rate ticked down to 5.8% in October from 5.9% in September. Analysts had expected the unemployment rate to remain unchanged last month.
While not overwhelmingly disappointing, the less-than-stellar report gave investors room to sell the greenback for profits and take time to rethink when the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates next year.
The dollar has firmed in recent weeks as investors prepare for U.S. monetary policy to grow less accommodative while Europe and Japan move in the opposite direction.
The Fed recently closed its monthly bond-buying program and is expected to raise interest rates some time in 2015, though the timing as to when next year benchmark borrowing costs may rise remains up in the air thanks to hit-or-miss U.S. data.

The drop in the euro came after Draghi said the ECB would start purchases of ABS in the near future. The program will run for two years, and have a “sizeable impact” on the ECB’s balance sheet Draghi said, moving it towards its 2012 levels.
He confirmed that the ECB has already started purchasing covered bonds, one of the easing measures implemented in an effort to avert the threat of deflation in the euro area.
He added that the governing council is unanimously committed to taking further “timely measures”, if needed.
The governing council believes the measures will move inflation back towards its target of close to, but just under 2%, he said.

The ECB’s governing council voted to keep its headline interest rate on hold at record lows of 0.05%. The bank also held the marginal lending rate at 0.3% and the deposit facility rate at minus 0.2%, in a widely anticipated decision.
Investors were looking to the bank’s press conference later Thursday for assurances that it remains prepared to implement additional stimulus measures if needed, in order to spur growth and inflation in the euro area.
The bank’s latest press conference was given extra significance following recent reports of tensions within the ECB over President Mario Draghi’s leadership.
Earlier Thursday, data showed that German factory orders rose just 0.8% in September, well below forecasts of a 2.3% increase. 
The weak data fuelled concerns over the outlook for the euro area’s largest economy.

Separately, the Institute of Supply Management said that its non-manufacturing index slowed to 57.1 last month from 58.6 in September. 
However, the employment component of the index rose, boosting the outlook for the labor market ahead of Friday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls report.

1639,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2014 10:00AM ET</span>",Reuters poll: ECB can weaken euro but only via sovereign QE - FX strategists,"By Sumanta Dey (Reuters) - The European Central Bank can still weaken the euro but only by buying sovereign bonds of the 18 countries that use the single currency, according to a majority of foreign exchange strategists polled by Reuters.
The euro <EUR/USD> has already weakened 9 percent against the dollar since the start of this year with most of the fall coming after the ECB announced measures in September aimed at boosting inflation and growth, including purchases of secured debt.
The weaker euro and of other stimulus measures have so far failed to bump up inflation, which at 0.4 percent in October is less than a quarter of the ECB's near 2 percent target. Many euro zone economies are already experiencing deflation.
The dollar has surged against every major currency in recent months as a solidifying economic recovery in the United States has stoked expectations the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by the middle of next year. The Fed ended its long-running bond-buying program last week.
Wednesday's poll saw the euro steadily weakening against the dollar over the next 12 months but respondents said it may not easily fall much further, especially if there is any moderation in the dollar's rise, unless the ECB eases policy significantly. Buying government bonds is among the last options it has left.
Twenty-nine of 38 currency strategists who answered an extra question said the ECB could influence the euro on its own, independent of the Fed's policy decisions.
""If the ECB is successful at expanding its balance sheet while that of the Fed stays the same or contracts, then it is in a position to influence the exchange rate of the euro,"" said Colin Asher, senior economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank.
A Reuters poll last week showed the ECB must expand its balance sheet by 1 trillion euros, roughly the size of Mexico's economy but a fraction of what the Fed printed over half a decade, to have an impact on inflation. [ECB/INT]
That was in line with President Mario Draghi's suggestion of getting the ECB's balance sheet back to its level of 2012, although national central bankers are unhappy he disclosed a target figure after policymakers agreed not to.
""Only with sovereign bonds can the ECB hope to reach the kind of stimulus, in terms of quantity, that's comparable to the United States. No other market in the euro zone is as large,"" Commerzbank foreign exchange strategist Esther Reichelt said.
There is now an even chance the ECB conducts sovereign quantitative easing, or buying bonds with new money, according to a Reuters poll of traders on Monday. [ECB/REFI]
The poll of 60 currency strategists conducted this week showed the euro is expected to trade at $1.25 in a month, $1.22 in six months and $1.20 in one year.
The consensus level is lower than in last month's poll and in line with positions in the futures market, where speculators heaped short contracts on the euro last week, taking bets against the currency to their largest since July 2012.
If the euro does fall as much as predicted by October next year, it would be at its weakest in five years and should help import some inflation into the bloc and stimulate exports.
But much depends on commodity and oil prices which can negate a weaker euro's contribution to raising inflation.
Global crude oil prices have plunged by $20 a barrel in just seven weeks due to a supply glut in the market. Prices for commodities such as iron ore have also fallen owing to a slowdown in China, by far the largest consumer of raw materials.
""The depreciation of the euro, especially against the dollar, has been nearly fully compensated by decreasing industrial and energy commodity prices,"" said Dag Muller, analyst at SEB.
The poll also showed the Japanese yen <USD/JPY> will weaken to 116.0 per dollar in a year but trade roughly around its current rate of 114.6 over the next six months.
The dollar jumped against the yen on Friday after the Bank of Japan surprised markets by increasing its purchases of government bonds and other assets.

However, the extra stimulus effectively acknowledges the failure so far of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ambitious plan to raise inflation in the economy by pumping trillions of yen into the money supply.
Economists polled by Reuters cut their annual growth forecast for Japan for a fifth straight month in October, saying there is no chance the BOJ will meet its 2 percent inflation goal by the next fiscal year. [ECILT/JP]

Crude oil is Canada’s largest export and the Canadian dollar is very sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices.

1644,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 05, 2014 06:12AM ET</span>","Forex - Russian ruble hits fresh record lows against dollar, euro","Investing.com - The Russian rouble fell to fresh record lows against the dollar and the euro on Wednesday after the country’s central bank announced that it was scaling back interventions aimed at supporting the currency.
USD/RUB hit session highs of 44.95, and was last up 1.19% to 44.25.
The drop in the rouble came after Russia’s central bank said it would cut back on currency market interventions and would allow the ruble’s exchange rate to be set “primarily by market factors”.
In a statement, the bank said it would limit its daily interventions to $350 million per day, well below levels seen in recent weeks, and would allow the ruble to fall further if selling pressure continued.
The bank said limiting the amount of intervention “would prevent the formation of conditions for speculative strategies against the ruble”.
It added that it reserved the right to conduct additional interventions on the currency market, if needed, to respond to “threats to financial stability.”
The announcement came after the bank hiked interest rates by 1.5% to 9.5% on Friday in an effort to stem the depreciation of the ruble and curb inflation.
The rouble has fallen by around 25% against the dollar so far this year as ongoing tensions in eastern Ukraine and broad based risk aversion towards Russia, as well as falling oil prices pressured the currency lower.
Sanctions imposed on Russia by the U.S. and the European Union for what they say is its role in backing separatists in eastern Ukraine have weakened the rouble, caused a spike in inflation and have almost completely shut Russian companies out of the global financial markets.
At the same time, the country’s economy has been hit by falling oil prices. Russia is the world’s second-largest oil exporter and half of its budget revenue is financed by taxes on energy exports.

“After GDP growth slowed to 0.7% in the third quarter, a 0.5% expansion is currently being signalled by the surveys for the fourth quarter. However, with inflows of work rising across all three sectors at the slowest rate for 16 months, there is a risk that economic growth could weaken further”.

USD/JPY was down 0.45% to 113.48, holding below the seven-year peaks of 114.20 struck in the previous session.
The yen remained under pressure after the Bank of Japan surprised markets by restarting its bond purchasing stimulus program on Friday, in a bid to shore up the faltering economic recovery.
The BoJ acted after data showed that inflation fell to its lowest in nearly a year in September, as a sales tax hike which came into effect in April continued to hit domestic demand. 
The move fuelled expectations that the European Central Bank will have to implement quantitative easing measures in order to stave off the threat of deflation and spur growth in the euro area.
Data on Monday highlighted the diverging monetary policy outlook between the Federal Reserve and its major peers.
The Institute of Supply Management reported that U.S. manufacturing activity rose more strongly than expected in October. 
In contrast, a report showed that manufacturing activity in the euro zone struggled to grow last month, while manufacturing activity in China slumped to a five-month low.
EUR/USD was up 0.26% to 1.2515, not far from the two year trough of 1.2437 set on Monday.
The US dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, slid 0.23% to 87.26, after rising to a four-year peak of 87.54 on Monday.
