17,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 15, 2012 02:04PM ET</span>",Greenback mostly flat on mixed data,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded slightly higher against its counterparts Monday, following stronger-than-forecast U.S. retail sales last month, but bullishness remained subdued amid ongoing Spanish bailout uncertainty. The Commerce Department reported U.S. retail sales rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.1% in September, beating expectations for a 0.8% increase. Retail sales in August were revised up to a 1.2% gain from a previously reported increase of 0.9%. Core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, rose by 1.1%, outstripping expectations for a 0.6% increase. A separate report showed that the New York Federal Reserve’s index of manufacturing conditions improved to minus 6.2 in October from minus 10.4 the previous month, but remained in contraction territory for the third consecutive month. The dollar pushed higher against the yen following the data, with USD/JPY rising 0.39% to 78.74. Meanwhile, the dollar was almost unchanged against the euro, with EUR/USD falling 0.06% to 1.2945. The euro remained under pressure amid some disappointment in markets after Madrid did not request financial aid over the weekend and a request for a bailout is now seen as increasingly unlikely ahead of regional elections on October 21. Elsewhere in the euro zone, uncertainty over when Greece will receive its next tranche of financial aid remained a source of concern. The greenback remained slightly higher against the pound, with GBP/USD dipping 0.04% to 1.6068 and was steady against the Swiss franc, withUSD/CHF inching down 0.02% to 0.9329.  The greenback was broadly weaker against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD slipping 0.07% to trade at 0.9790,AUD/USD rising 0.17% to 1.0250 and NZD/USD climbing 0.31% to 0.8189. The Bank of Canada’s business outlook survey published earlier showed that companies are less optimistic on sales, employment and investment for the third quarter and are focusing on minimizing costs. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, edged up 0.04% to 79.80 In other news Monday, official data showed that U.S. business inventories rose slightly more-than-expected in August, climbing 0.6% compared to expectations for a 0.5% gain. "

During U.S. afternoon trade, the greenback moved lower against the euro with the EUR/USD adding 0.42%  The U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits last week fell by 30,000 to a seasonally adjusted 339,000, compared to expectations for an increase of 1,000 to 370,000. The previous week’s figure was revised up to 369,000 from a previously reported 367,000. A separate report showed that the U.S. trade deficit widened to USD44.2 billion in August, broadly in line with market expectations, as imports outpaced exports. Earlier Thursday, the minutes of the Bank of Japan’s September meeting indicated that some policymakers were leaning towards more aggressive easing measures, boosting expectations that the central bank may ease policy again later this month. The BoJ increased the size of its asset purchase program by JPY10 trillion last month. The euro remained supported amid hopes that a ratings downgrade on Spain by Standard & Poor’s would force Madrid to formally request a bailout, which investors hope will ease the debt crisis in the euro zone.

In Canada, official data showed that the trade deficit narrowed to CAD1.3 billion in August, compared to expectations for a deficit of CAD2.0 billion. The Australian dollar remained supported after official data showed that the country’s economy added 14,500 jobs in September, easily beating expectations for an increase of 3,800.  The country’s unemployment rate ticked up to 5.4% in September, against expectations for an increase to 5.3%, from 5.1% in August.

The greenback was steady close to a one-month high against the pound, with GBP/USD inching up 0.03% to 1.6008.

Separately, a report by Westpac and the Melbourne Institute showed that Australian consumer sentiment improved only modestly in October, despite three interest rate cuts in the past six months by the country’s central bank. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gave back 0.06% to 80.05.

Italy’s Treasury auctioned EUR8 billion of 12-month bonds at an average yield of 1.94% up from 1.69% previously and the highest level since mid-August. Meanwhile, concerns over whether international creditors will extend loans to Greece continued, as the country struggles to meet deficit reduction targets. The euro was almost unchanged against the pound, with EUR/GBP gaining 0.02% to 0.8052 and edged higher against the yen, with EUR/JPY up 0.17% to 101.00.  Trade was expected to remain subdued on Wednesday, with no major economic data releases on the calendar. "

Investor confidence was also hit by data showing that the Sentix index of investor confidence in the euro zone for October improved less-than-expected, ticking up to minus 22 from a reading of minus 23.2 the previous month.  Analysts had expected the index to improve to minus 20.8.  A separate report showed that German industrial production fell 0.5% in August, less than the expected 0.8% decline, after a 1.2% increase the previous month.  Elsewhere, the euro was higher against the pound with EUR/GBP adding 0.14%, to hit 0.8089.  Trading volumes were expected to be light on Monday, as bond markets in the U.S. were to remain closed for Columbus Day. "

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar fell to a two-week low against the euro, with EUR/USD advancing 0.86% to 1.3017. Sparking the risk on euro trade, central bank President Mario Draghi said the bank was ready to undertake Outright Monetary Transactions when the prerequisites are in place and reiterated that the central bank was acting strictly within its mandate in undertaking a bond buying program via OMT’s. Draghi said the announcement of OMT’s had helped alleviate market tensions in recent weeks. He added economic risks in the euro zone remain to the downside and added that economic indicators point to weak growth in the third quarter. The ECB left rates on hold at a record low 0.75% earlier, in a widely anticipated decision. Market sentiment has been underpinned by hopes that Spain will soon request a bailout and trigger the ECB’s bond purchasing program, a move which investors hope would ease the debt crisis in the region. The greenback was also lower against the pound, with GBP/USD up 0.66% to 1.6182. The Bank of England left rates on hold at a record low 0.5% following its policy meeting and left the size of its bond purchasing program unchanged at GBP375 billion, in line with market expectations. Elsewhere, the greenback was fractionally lower against the yen, withUSD/JPY inching down 0.07% to 78.43 and extended losses against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF dropping 0.69% to 0.9320. The greenback was mixed against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD down 0.51% to 0.9825, AUD/USD easing up 0.08% to 1.0222 and NZD/USD dipping 0.08% to 0.8187. The Canadian dollar found support after the senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada indicated earlier that the central bank was still looking at raising rates and said that the bank would continue to monitor conditions in the labor market. Meanwhile, data showed that Canada’s Ivey purchasing managers’ index fell to 60.4 last month from a reading of 62.5 in August, compared to expectations for a reading of 59.0. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.62% to 79.56. In the U.S., the Department of Labor said the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week rose to 367,000, compared to expectations for an increase to 370,000. "

The dollar traded higher against the euro with EUR/USD falling 0.13% to 1.2903.  The dollar’s gains came after a report by the Institute of Supply Management said its services purchasing manager's index rose to 55.1 in September from a reading of 53.7 in August.   Analysts had expected the index to decline to 53.2 in September.  Meanwhile, payroll processing firm ADP said the U.S. private sector added a seasonally adjusted 162,000 jobs in September, surpassing expectations for an increase of 143,000.  The previous month’s figure was revised down to a gain of 189,000 from a previously reported increase of 201,000. Investors remained cautious as uncertainty over the timing of a Spanish bailout persisted after the country’s prime minister said Tuesday that a request for aid was not imminent, despite ongoing speculation that Madrid is moving closer to requesting external financial aid. Market sentiment remained on the back foot after a string of weak service sector data earlier in the session fuelled concerns over the outlook for the global economic recovery. The final euro zone services PMI came in at 46.1 in September, well below the 50 level which separates contraction from expansion. The greenback climbed to a three-week high against the pound, with GBP/USD down 0.34% to 1.6076. Sterling remained under pressure after data showed that the U.K. service sector shed jobs for the first time in 10 months in September as growth slowed; undermining hopes for a sustained recovery in the recession hit economy. Elsewhere, the greenback pushed higher against the Swiss franc, withUSD/CHF up 0.22% to 0.9384. The greenback gained ground against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD rising 0.26% to 0.9867,AUD/USD down 0.49% to 1.0216 and NZD/USD dropping 0.91% to 0.8199. Earlier Wednesday, official data showed that Australia posted the largest trade deficit in three-and-a-half years in August as export demand slowed, one day after the country’s central bank cut interest rates for the third time in six months. Meanwhile, official data showed that growth in China’s service sector moderated in September, underlining concerns over a slowdown in the world’s second largest economy. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, climbed 0.24% to 80.03. Investors were looking ahead to Thursday’s policy setting meetings by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, as well as the release of the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s most recent policy meeting. "

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was lower against the euro, withEUR/USD rising 0.27% to 1.2924. Sentiment on the euro was boosted after Reuters reported Monday that Spain may be preparing to request a bailout as early as next weekend, but Germany is urging Madrid to wait. Uncertainty over the timing of a possible bailout request persisted after Spanish media outlets reported earlier that Spain’s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy told members of his political party that he will not request external financial assistance this weekend. Ratings agency Moody’s announced earlier that it would release the details of its ratings review on Spain later this month, as it was still assessing several factors, including the draft budget for 2013 and the nature and size of support mechanisms.  The results of the ratings review had been due to be announced at the end of September. The greenback was also lower against the pound, with GBP/USD climbing 0.09% to 1.6145. In the U.K., a report showed that the Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers' index ticked up to 49.5 last month from a reading of 49.0 in August, but remained below the 50 level which indicates a contraction for the second consecutive month. The data came after a report by mortgage lender Nationwide said house prices in the U.K. unexpectedly fell by 0.4% in September and are now 1.4% lower than in the same month last year. Elsewhere, the greenback was fractionally higher against the yen, withUSD/JPY inching up 0.04% to 78.01, but weakened against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF down 0.39% to 0.9346. The greenback was mixed against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD edging up 0.10% to 0.9833,AUD/USD dropping 0.70% to 1.0288 and NZD/USD climbing 0.35% to hit 0.8304. Elsewhere Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates to 3.25% from 3.5%, the third rate cut in six months, citing a worsening outlook for the global economy and signs of a weakening local labor market. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.31% to 79.64 "

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was solidly lower against the euro, with EUR/USD gaining 0.40% to 1.2925. Speaking at a press conference, Spain’s budget minister said he was confident that the country would meet its deficit target for this year and said that the draft budget for 2013 was based on unchanged economic forecasts, which indicated a light recession next year. The budget statement came amid ongoing social unrest in Spain in the face of harsh austerity measures and speculation in markets over whether Madrid will seek a bailout.  On Friday, the results of an audit of the country’s troubled banking sector were due to be published. In the U.S, official data showed that the economy expanded 1.3% in the second quarter, down from a preliminary estimate of 1.7%. Economists had expected the rate of growth to remain unchanged. A separate report showed that U.S. durable goods orders fell 13.2% in August, the steepest decline since January 2009, compared to expectations for a 5.0% decline. Another report showed that the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week fell to 359,000 from 385,000, compared to expectations for a decrease to 378,000. The greenback was down against the pound, with GBP/USD up 0.48% to 1.6242. In the U.K. earlier, official data showed that the economy contracted by 0.4% in the three months to June, up from the preliminary estimate of a 0.5% decline. The annualized rate of decline remained unrevised 0.5%, in line with expectations. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY down 0.15% to 77.62 and USD/CHF inching down 0.05% to 0.9387. The greenback was broadly weaker against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD shedding 0.43% to trade at 0.9812, AUD/USD rising 0.67% to 1.0440 and NZD/USDjumping 0.93% to 0.8319. The growth linked dollars were boosted by reports that China's central bank injected a record USD57.9 billion into the country's banking system this week, following a sharp rise in demand for cash from banks. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, slipped 0.41% to 79.57. Also Thursday, a report released by the National Association of Realtors showed that U.S. pending home sales dropped 2.6% in August, compared to expectations for a 0.7% drop."

314,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 26, 2012 12:21PM ET</span>","Forex - EUR/USD lower on QE 3 worries, weak housing data","Investing.com - The euro traded lower against the dollar Wednesday after a Federal Reserve governor blasted the U.S. central bank's decision for QE3 despite weak new homes sales weighing on the greenback. In U.S. afternoon trading on Wednesday, EUR/USD was trading down 0.28% at 1.2864. The pair was likely to test support at 1.2816, the low from Sept. 12, and resistance at 1.2980, Monday's high. Pressuring the greenback, new home sales in the U.S. fell unexpectedly last month, official data showed on Wednesday. In a report, the Census Bureau said that new home sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 373K, from 374K in the preceding month whose figure was revised up from 372K. Analysts had expected new home sales to rise to 380K last month. Earlier, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser, a noted inflation hawk, said a decision to roll out a third round of quantitative easing to encourage investing and hiring won't work in that households and businesses would rather pay down debts than take on new leverage. Quantitative easing functions via pumping liquidity into the financial system in a way that pushes down interest rates across the economy to encourage borrowing. ""And as far as households are concerned, they continue to try to repair their balance sheets in the wake of substantial losses of housing wealth, as I indicated earlier. They are deleveraging and saving more. It seems unlikely that a small drop in interest rates will overturn the strong desire to save and, instead, induce households to spend more,"" Plosser said in a speech earlier, according to prepared remarks of his presentation. ""Thus, in my view, we are unlikely to see much benefit to growth or to employment from further asset purchases. If I am right, then conveying the idea that such action will have a substantive impact on labor markets and the speed of the recovery risks the Fed’s credibility,"" Plosser added.  ""This is quite costly: If the public loses confidence in the central bank, our ability to set effective monetary policy in the future will be harmed and households and businesses will feel the consequences."" Helping lift the dollar, the Standard & Poor’s/Case Shiller House Price Index showed that home price in 20 cities rose 1.2% in July of this year compared with the same month a year ago. Analysts had expected the closely watched gauge on home prices to rise 1.0% in July. Elsewhere, the Conference Board, an industry group, reported that its consumer confidence index rose to 70.3 in September from an upwardly revised 61.3 in August.  September's reading was the highest since February and outpacing analysts' calls for a 63.0 reading. The euro did see support, however, on news that German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble said European policymakers should do everything in their power to protect the single currency, pointing out that defending the euro was ""worth any effort."" Talk that lawyers in Germany are examining the legality of the European Central Bank's bond purchasing program offset Schauble's bullish comments for the euro. The euro, meanwhile, was down against the pound and down against the yen, with EUR/GBP trading down 0.04% at 0.7964, and EUR/JPY trading down 0.33% at 100.03. "

In other news Tuesday, ECB President Mario Draghi said the debt crisis in the euro zone is not over and urged governments to continue to take decisive measures to ensure the future of the bloc. "

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar gained against the euro, with EUR/USD down 0.39% to 1.2930. The single currency weakened broadly following a report showing that Germany’s Ifo business confidence index deteriorated to the lowest level since March 2010 this month, amid ongoing concerns over euro zone’s debt crisis. The German Ifo index fell to 101.4 from 102.3 in August, the fifth monthly decline in a row, compared to expectations for a reading of 102.5. Meanwhile, uncertainty over whether Spain will request a full scale sovereign bailout weighed. On Thursday Madrid is to present its draft budget for next year and announce structural reforms, while the results of bank stress tests are due on Friday. In addition, ratings agency Moody’s is expected to complete a ratings review on Spain later this week. Over the weekend, Spain’s economy minister said the country would not rush to seek external financial aid, as pressure mounted on Spain to seek a bailout. The greenback was also higher against the pound, with GBP/USD slipping 0.04% to 1.6222. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the yen, with USD/JPY losing 0.31% to hit 77.91, but was up against the Swiss franc, withUSD/CHF rising 0.46% to 0.9371. The minutes of the Bank of Japan’s August meeting published earlier showed that policymakers believed a high degree of uncertainty over the global economic outlook remained and said that the bank would proceed with continuous monetary easing. The greenback was broadly higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD climbing 0.38% to 0.9800,AUD/USD falling 0.39% to 1.0415 and NZD/USD tumbling 0.87% to 0.8215. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.19% to 79.59. In other news, concerns over Greece persisted as Athens prepared to present a package of spending cuts demand by international lenders to euro zone officials at the end of this week, amid fears that the country’s budget shortfall could be larger than expected. "

During European trade, the dollar eased lower against the euro, with EUR/USD climbing 0.03% to 1.2974. The euro turned bullish after a news report that European Union authorities are  covertly working  toward a Spanish rescue program and unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank, to be revealed next week. Meetings between the Spanish government and the European Commission were said to be  discussing measures that would be demanded by international lenders as part of a new rescue program, ensuring they are in place before a bailout is formally requested. According to the newspaper, negotiations have been conducted directly with Spain's Finance Minister Luis de Guindos and the plan will focus on structural reforms, rather than new taxes and spending cuts.  The greenback was also lower against the pound, with GBP/USD advancing 0.32% to 1.6267. Government data revealed  U.K. public sector net borrowing rose to GBP12.4 billion in August, below the expected increase to GBP13.3 billion, following a reading of minus GBP1.9 billion the previous month. Elsewhere, the greenback was steady against the yen, with USD/JPY dropping 0.06% to hit 78.20, and lower against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF falling 0.06% to trade at 0.9326. In its quarterly bulletin, the Swiss National Bank reported it is leaving the minimum exchange rate unchanged at CHF1.20 per euro, and will continue to enforce it with the utmost determination.  In addition, the greenback was broadly lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD falling 0.30% to 0.9741, AUD/USD rallying 0.73% to 1.0512 and NZD/USD climbing 0.44% to hit 0.8326. Earlier in the day, the Conference Board said that its leading index of economic indicators for Australia was flat in July, following an upwardly revised 0.5% rise the previous month. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, dropped 0.13%, to trade at 79.39.Traders were experiencing light volumes Friday as there are no significant economic events scheduled for the session. "

409,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 20, 2012 01:12PM ET</span>",Greenback soars on weak economic reports,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded sharply higher against its major counterparts Thursday, as market sentiment remained under pressure following a flurry of downbeat economic reports from the U.S., the euro zone and China. During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was solidly higher against the euro, with EUR/USD dropping 0.80% to 1.2945. The euro remained under pressure after preliminary data showed that the euro zone’s manufacturing purchasing manufacturers' index rose more-than-expected in September to 46.0, from 45.1 the previous month, while the service sector PMI fell unexpectedly to 46.0, from 47.2. A separate report showed that manufacturing activity in Germany contracted at the slowest rate in six months in September, while service sector activity grew modestly. In France, manufacturing activity tumbled unexpectedly in September, dropping to a three-and-a-half year low led by a marked reduction in incoming new business.  Also Thursday, Spain’s Treasury sold EUR859 billion worth of 10-year government bonds at an average yield of 5.66%, down from 6.64% at a similar auction last month. The greenback was also higher against the pound, with GBP/USDfalling 0.10% to 1.6206. The pound found some support after official data showed that U.K. retail sales fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in August, compared to expectations for a 0.4% decline. Retail sales rose by 0.3% in July. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the yen, with USD/JPYedging down 0.07% to hit 78.32, but sharply higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF climbing 0.53% to trade at 0.9333. In Japan, official data showed that the trade deficit widened unexpectedly to JPY0.47 trillion in August, from a deficit of JPY0.37 trillion the previous month. Analysts had expected the trade balance to remain unchanged in August. In addition, the greenback was broadly higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD rising 0.39% to 0.9783, AUD/USD dropping 0.69% to 1.0407 and NZD/USD slipping 0.15% to hit 0.8256. The commodity-linked currencies came under broad selling pressure after data showed that China’s HSBC Flash Purchasing Managers Index remained in contraction territory for the 11th consecutive month, adding to fears over a further slowdown in the region’s largest economy. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, climbed 0.57%, to trade at 79.62. In the U.S., official data showed that manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia-region improved more-than-expected in September, but remained in contraction territory for the fifth consecutive month. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said that its manufacturing index improved to minus 1.9 in September from August’s reading of minus 7.1.  The data came after the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending September 15 fell to a seasonally adjusted 382,000, compared to expectations for a decrease to 375,000. "

432,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 19, 2012 01:03PM ET</span>",Forex - Greenback mixed on conflicting data,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded mixed against its major rivals Wednesday, following the release of a series of U.S. economic data, while new worries over the sovereign debt crisis continued to linger. During U.S. morning trade, the dollar was almost unchanged against the euro, with EUR/USD moving higher by 0.15% to 1.3067. Sentiment on the euro remained fragile after reports surfaced that some German lawmakers are seeking to water down proposals for a European banking union and supervision of euro zone banks by the European Central Bank. Dow Jones Newswires reported that the German government not only wants a strict separation of bank supervision and monetary policy in Europe, but also favors a separate bank-supervision body that would give large countries more votes. Investor confidence had also weakened following reports earlier in the week that Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy remains uncertain about asking for help from the European Central Bank's new bond-purchasing program, which would mean signing up to a permanent bailout fund. The greenback was higher against the pound, with GBP/USD slipping 0.15% to 1.6220. The minuntes of the Bank of England's August meeting showed earlier that policymakers voted 9 to zero in favor of leaving U.K. interest rates unchanged at 0.5% and also agreed to leave the quantitative easing program unchanged at GBP375 billion. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY dropping 0.55% to hit 78.38, and with USD/CHF edging down 0.19% to trade at 0.9267. Earlier in the day, the Bank of Japan boosted the size of its monthly bond purchases by JPY10 trillion to a total of JPY80 trillion and left its policy interest-rate target unchanged in the current range of zero to 0.1%. The JPY10 trillion increase in the asset-purchase program will be split equally towards additional purchases of treasury discount bills and Japanese government bonds, the central bank said in a statement. In addition, the greenback was mixed against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD adding 0.14% to 0.9755, AUD/USD inching 0.08% higher to 1.0465 and NZD/USD rising 0.14% to hit 0.8283. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.15%, to trade at 79.15. In the U.S., the National Association of Realtors said that existing home sales rose by 7.8% to a seasonally adjusted 4.82 million units in August, easily surpassing expectations for a 2% increase to 4.55 million units. The report came after official data showed that U.S. housing starts rose by 2.3% in August to a seasonally adjusted 0.750 million, below expectations for a 2.85 increase to 0.765 million. The report also showed that the number of building permits issued in August fell 1% to a seasonally adjusted 0.803 million, compared to expectations for a decline of 1.8% to 0.796 million. "

475,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 17, 2012 01:05PM ET</span>",Greenback mixed as Spanish fears counteract Fed easing,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded mixed against its major counterparts  Monday, as the announcement of fresh easing measures by the Federal Reserve continued to weigh on the greenback, while renewed Spanish debt worries increased. During U.S. morning trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD falling 0.08% to 1.3118. The euro came under pressure after Spain's government faced protests over the weekend against public spending cuts, even as Madrid told its European partners that its next steps to overhaul the economy would avoid further cuts in public spending.  Also Monday, the ECB said that its current account fell to EUR9.7 billion in July, from EUR14.3 billion the previous month. Analysts had expected the bank's current account to decline to EUR10 billion in July. A separate report showed that the euro zone's trade surplus narrowed unexpectedly to EUR7.9 billion in July from EUR9.3 billion the previous month. The greenback was lower against the pound, with GBP/USD rising 0.27% to 1.6258. Industry data showed earlier that house prices in the U.K. fell by 0.6% in September, following a 2.4% drop the previous month. Elsewhere, the greenback was sharply higher against the yen, withUSD/JPY climbing 0.45% to hit 78.74, and almost unchanged against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF dipping 0.03% to trade at 0.9265. In addition, the greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD edging 0.06% higher to 0.9721, AUD/USD dropping 0.46% to 1.0501 and NZD/USD falling 0.24% to hit 0.8270. In New Zealand, the Westpac Banking Corporation said that its index of consumer sentiment rose to 102.5 in the thrid quarter, from a reading of 99.9 in the previous quarter.  The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.01%, to trade at 78.97. The greenback remained under pressure after the Fed announced last week that it would buy USD40 billion of mortgage-backed securities every month and would keep buying them until the job market improves. The bank also said it expects to keep short-term interest rates at record low levels through at least mid-2015, six months longer than previously anticipated. Earlier Monday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said that its index of manufacturing activity fell unexpectedly to minus 10.4 in September, from a reading of 5.8 the previous month. Analysts had expected the index to decline to improve to minus 2 in September. "

The pair was likely to find support at 1.2906, the low of May 11 and resistance at 1.3178, the high of May 4. The Federal Reserve announced Thursday that it would buy USD40 billion of mortgage-backed securities every month and would keep buying them until the real estate market improves.  ""We want to see lower unemployment. We want to see a stronger economy that can cause the improvement to be sustained,"" Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said following the central bank's two-day policy meeting. In other news, euro zone finance ministers were to hold informal talks in Cyprus about whether Spain should ask for financial support after the announcement of the European Central Bank's new bond-buying programme brought Madrid's borrowing costs sharply lower. Asked about the conditionality of a bailout for Spain, Spanish Finance Minister Luis De Guindos said that ""it is much more important to meet public deficit targets and comply with our program of reform than a potential rescue."" Elsewhere, the euro was steady against the pound with EUR/GBP dipping 0.30%, to hit 0.8066, and sharply higher against the yen with EUR/JPY rocketing 1.47%, to trade at 102.15. Later in the session, official data was to be published on consumer price inflation in the euro zone, while European Union finance ministers were to hold a first day of talks in Brussels. The U.S. was to publish official reports on consumer price inflation, retail sales and business inventories. The University of Michigan was also to produce preliminary reports on consumer sentiment and inflation expectations.  "

530,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 13, 2012 02:21PM ET</span>",Forex - Greenback sharply lower on FOMC stimulus announcement,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar plunged lower against its major rivals Thursday, as the FOMC announced significant stimulus measures designed to boost the U.S. economy. During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was sharply lower against the euro, with EUR/USD surging 0.67% to 1.2987. Sending the greenback lower,  the FOMC stated it will purchase $40 billion of mortgages monthly in an attempt to shore up the real estate market recovery. Data released earlier in the day showed that the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending September 8 rose by 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 382,000, compared to expectations for an increase of 3,000 to 370,000. The previous week’s figure was revised up to 367,000 from a previously reported 365,000. A separate report showed that producer prices in the U.S. rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.7% in August, compared to expectations for a 1.1% increase, after rising 0.3% in July. The greenback was also lower against the pound, with GBP/USD adding 0.29% to trade at 1.6151. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the yen, with USD/JPY slumping 0.53% to hit 77.66, but higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF gaining 0.24% to trade at 0.9395. Earlier in the day, Swiss National Bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged in September and reaffirmed its commitment to the minimum exchange rate of CHF1.20 per euro. Meanwhile, the greenback was mixed against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD inching down 0.15% to 0.9747, AUD/USD falling 0.12% to 1.0452 and NZD/USD edging 0.34% higher to trade at 0.8240. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand left the benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low of 2.50%, in a widely expected move. Commenting on the decision, RBNZ Chairman Allan Bollard said there was little need to raise borrowing costs until the second half of 2013 because of risks from the euro zone’s financial crisis and the outlook for New Zealand’s trading partners, including China. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.60%, trading at 79.40. "

The pair was likely to find support at 1.2816, the session low and resistance at 1.3006, the high of May 9. The ruling by Germany’s constitutional court permits the country’s president to ratify the European Stability Mechanism under certain conditions and clear the way for the European Central Bank’s bond purchasing program to proceed. The court said Germany’s liability to the EMS must not exceed EUR190 billion without the approval of the lower house of parliament and said that both houses of parliament must be kept informed about decisions relating to the ESM. Following the ruling, Eurogroup head Jean-Claude Juncker said the ESM's board of governors will hold their first meeting on October 8. Italy saw borrowing drop sharply at an auction of three- and 12-month government bonds following the decision, reflecting growing optimism policymakers in the euro zone will do more to stem the region’s ongoing debt crisis. The greenback remained under broad selling pressure amid speculation that the U.S. central bank may implement a third round of quantitative easing after its upcoming policy meeting, which concludes on Thursday. Adding to pressure on the greenback, ratings agency Moody’s said on Tuesday that it could downgrade the U.S’s triple-A rating if budget negotiations for 2013 do not result in policy measures which will reduce the country’s debt. The euro was higher against the pound and the yen, with EUR/GBP easing higher by 0.03% to 0.8002 and EUR/JPY up 0.41% to 100.37. Also Wednesday, official data showed that U.S. import prices rose for the first time in five months in August, climbing 0.7% as fuel prices increased, but were still below expectations for a 1.4% increase. "

During U.S.afternoon trade, the dollar fell to a four-month low against the euro, with EUR/USD rallying 0.71% to 1.2848. The greenback extended losses after Moody’s announced that it could downgrade the U.S’s triple-A rating if budget negotiations for 2013 do not result in policy measures which will reduce the country’s debt. The greenback has come under selling pressure in recent days amid speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve may implement a third round of quantitative easing after its upcoming policy meeting, which concludes on Thursday. The euro was underpinned by expectations that the German constitutional court would find that the euro zone’s new bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, was not a violation of the German constitution in a ruling to be delivered on Wednesday. The greenback hit a fresh four-month low against the pound, with GBP/USD climbing 0.54% to 1.6077. In the U.K., official data showed that the goods trade deficit narrowed unexpectedly in July, as exports to countries outside of the European Union jumped to a record high. The Office for National Statistics said the goods trade deficit contracted to GBP7.14 billion in July, from GBP10.06 billion in June, compared to expectations for a deficit of GBP11.8 billion. Elsewhere, the greenback hit multi-month lows against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY dropping 0.63% to 77.78 and USD/CHFfalling 0.71% to 0.9396. The greenback was sharply lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD shedding 0.61% to trade at 0.9716, AUD/USD rallying 1.02% to 1.0439 and NZD/USD surging 1.11% to 0.8178. Canada posted a trade deficit of CAD2.3 billion in July official data showed earlier, compared to expectations for a deficit of CAD1.0 billion. However a separate report showed that Canadian housing starts rose to 224,900 units in August from 208,000 the previous month, defying expectations for a decline to 200,000. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.72% to 80.00. "

The greenback also remained under broad selling pressure amid speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve may implement a third round of quantitative easing after its upcoming policy meeting, which concludes on Thursday. Government data on Friday showed that the U.S. economy added fewer-than-expected jobs in August, increasing the likelihood that the Fed will act to strengthen the U.S. economic recovery. Earlier Tuesday, official data showed that the U.S. trade deficit widened less-than-expected in July, holding just above the 18-month low gap hit in June. The U.S. trade deficit widened to a seasonally adjusted USD42.0 billion from a downwardly revised deficit of USD41.9 billion in June. Analysts had expected the U.S. trade deficit to widen to USD44.0 billion.  Demand for the single currency continued to be underpinned by expectations that Germany’s constitutional court would find that the euro zone’s new bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, was not a violation of the German constitution in a ruling to be delivered on Wednesday.

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD down 0.20% to 1.2790.  The euro fell off an almost four-month high amid profit taking, while investors were also cautious ahead of a German court ruling on the constitutionality of the euro zone’s bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism later in the week. Demand for the single currency continued to be underpinned after the European Central Bank unveiled details of its bond purchasing program, which is aimed at lowering the borrowing costs of peripheral euro zone members. Meanwhile, the greenback remained under pressure amid growing expectations that that the U.S. central bank will implement further stimulus measures to strengthen the economic recovery following its policy meeting on Thursday.

The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.12% to 80.41.

630,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 07, 2012 11:27AM ET</span>",Greenback slammed on weak job numbers,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded sharply lower against its major counterparts  Friday, as lack luster nonfarm payroll and employment numbers disappointed greenback bulls, while the unveiling of the European Central Bank's new bond-buying plan supported demand for riskier assets. During European late morning trade, the dollar was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD rocketing 1.25% to 1.2789.  Knocking the greenback lower, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said that nonfarm payrolls rose by 96,000 in August, less than the expected 125,000 rise and following an increase of 141,000 rise the previous month. The report also showed that the employment rate in the U.S. ticked down to 8.1% last month from 8.3% in June. Analysts had expected the unemployment rate to remain unchanged.  The euro remained supported after ECB President Mario Draghi unveiled on Thursday a new bond-purchasing program, dubbed Outright Monetary Transactions, which he said will provide ""a fully effective backstop"" against market volatility. Speaking at the bank’s post-policy meeting press conference, Draghi said ""strict and effective conditionality” was an essential element of the plan. Under the terms of the plan, the ECB would buy unlimited amounts of government bonds of up to three years in maturity, as long as the country in question is signed up to the OMT program and agrees to economic reforms. The bank also maintained the benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.75% at its policy meeting earlier in the day, in line with expectations. The greenback was also lower against the pound, with GBP/USD adding 0.55% to 1.6020. Official data showed earlier that manufacturing production in the U.K. posted its strongest monthly rise in 10 years in July, rising by 3.2%, following a 2.9% decline the previous month.  Analysts had expected manufacturing production to rise by 2% in July. Separately, U.K. industrial production posted its sharpest monthly rise since July 1987 last month, climbing 2.9% after a 2.4% fall in June. Data also showed that U.K. producer price inflation input climbed by 2% in August, beating expectations for a 1.7% rise and following an increase of 0.4% the previous month. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY plunging 0.98% to hit 78.09, and USD/CHF falling 0.87% to trade at 0.94.54. In addition, the greenback was lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD slipping 0.49% to 0.9779,AUD/USD advancing 1.03% to 1.0392 and NZD/USD climbing 1.22% to hit 0.8111. "

Elsewhere, the greenback was sharply higher against the yen, with USD/JPY adding 0.68% to 78.92.

During U.S. morning trade, the dollar pushed higher against the euro, with EUR/USD slipping 0.21% to 1.2566. The dollar held gains after the Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing purchasing managers’ index ticked down to 49.6 in August from 49.8 in July, compared to expectations for a reading of 50.0. The report said that new orders fell and inventories rose, indicating that sales are dropping, while the number of new workers hired fell to the lowest level since late 2009. The data came amid ongoing speculation over how close the Federal Reserve is to implementing another round of easing, after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said Friday that the bank would act as needed to strengthen the U.S. economic recovery. Demand for the euro continued to be underpinned by expectations that the ECB will announce details of measures to help stabilize the region’s sovereign debt markets after its upcoming policy setting meeting on Thursday. The greenback was almost unchanged against the pound, with GBP/USD dipping 0.01% to 1.5884. In the U.K., data which was not scheduled for release until Wednesday morning showed that the service sector experienced robust growth last month. Markit's services PMI rose to 53.7, the highest level since March, from a reading of 51.0 in July. Elsewhere, the greenback added to gains against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY rising 0.16% to 78.38, and USD/CHF adding 0.26% to trade at 0.9560. The Swissie shrugged off official data showing that Switzerland’s gross domestic product contracted by 0.1% in the second quarter, disappointing expectation for a 0.2% increase, as exports to the euro zone fell. The Swiss economy still expanded at an annualized rate of 0.5% in the three months to June, compared with the same period last year. The greenback was broadly higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD inching up 0.03% to 0.9860, AUD/USD losing 0.13% to trade at 1.0234 and NZD/USD down 0.54% to 0.7932. The Reserve Bank of Australia left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 3.50% following its policy meeting on Tuesday and said current monetary policy remained appropriate, despite the moderating pace of global growth. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.21% to 81.34. In addition Tuesday, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the ECB would be right to help ailing euro zone countries by purchasing their debt, as long as they committed to implementing economic reforms in return. "

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar spiked lower against the euro, with EUR/USD higher by 0.46% to 1.2228. The heavily anticipated Federal Reserve minutes revealed that many Fed members agree that additional monetary stimulus will be needed if the economy doesn’t show signs of a durable pick up, sending the greenback spiraling lower. The euro continued to be supported by speculation that the ECB will soon implement policy measures to help stabilize the euro zone's sovereign debt markets.  Investors were also eyeing the outcome of a series of euro zone meetings this week, amid hopes for progress on tackling the debt crisis in the region. The greenback was trading close to a three-month low against the pound, with GBP/USD rising 0.15% to 1.5808. Earlier Wednesday, Bank of England policymaker Adam Posen said the U.K. economy was stagnating and warned that if the situation in the euro zone deteriorated it would overwhelm the U.K. economy in ways that the central bank would not be able to counteract. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the yen, with USD/JPY slipping 1.21% to hit 78.32. In Japan, official data earlier showed that exports fell to the lowest level in six months in July, as the euro zone’s debt crisis and a slowdown in China hit demand. The dollar was little changed against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF dipping 0.53% to 0.9583 The greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD up 0.30% to hit 0.9921, AUD/USD falling 0.39% to 1.0448 and NZD/USD down 0.15% to trade at 0.8096. The Canadian dollar fell to a session low against the greenback after official data showed that Canadian retail sales fell 0.4% in June, confounding expectations for a gain of 0.1%. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, plunged 0.52% to 81.51. Markets showed little reaction to data showing that U.S. existing home sales rose less-than-expected in July. The National Association of Realtors said that existing home sales rose by 2.3% to a seasonally adjusted 4.47 million units in July, disappointing expectations for a 3.2% increase to 4.52 million units.  Existing home sales in June totaled 4.37 million units. "

The pair was likely to find support at 1.2341, Wednesday’s low and near-term resistance at 1.2486, Tuesday’s high and a seven-week high. Market participants remained cautious ahead of the minutes of the Fed’s August policy setting meeting, due out later in the session, amid speculation over how close the U.S. central bank may be to implementing another round of stimulus measures. Overall market sentiment continued be supported by speculation that the European Central Bank will soon implement policy measures to help stabilize the euro zone's sovereign debt markets. In the euro zone, Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the euro zone’s finance ministers, and Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras were preparing to hold talks to discuss a two-year extension of the country’s economic reform program. Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel was to meet with French President Francois Hollande on Thursday, while Antonis Samaras was to meet with the French and German leaders later in the week. The euro was fractionally lower against the pound and the yen, withEUR/GBP slipping 0.07% to 0.7894 and EUR/JPY slipping 0.16% to 98.72.

929,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 21, 2012 02:15PM ET</span>",Forex- U.S. dollar slammed as risk on trade takes hold,"Investing.com - The greenback traded sharply lower against its rivals Tuesday, as the risk on trade was triggered by European Central Bank intervention speculation. During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was sharply lower against the euro, with EUR/USD rallying 1.06% to 1.2475. The euro strengthened broadly after a report in the U.K.’s Telegraph newspaper said it could confirm weekend reports that the ECB may set a cap on peripheral euro zone bond yields at its next policy meeting in September, beyond which its bond buying program would kick in. On Monday, the ECB dismissed the reports, saying it was “misleading” to report on decisions which have not yet been taken. Speculation over prospects for action by the ECB saw Spanish borrowing costs fall at an auction of short-term government debt earlier, with Madrid successful auctioning EUR4.5 billion of bills, the top end of the target range. Meanwhile, investors were looking ahead to a series of euro zone meetings later in the week, amid hopes that leaders would make some progress on steps to the stem the crisis in the region. The greenback was down against the pound, with GBP/USD rising 0.46% to 1.5781. In the U.K., official data showed that public sector borrowing rose unexpectedly in July, fuelling concerns over the state of public finances. The National Statistics Office said that public sector net borrowing posted a surplus of GBP1.8 billion in July, compared to a deficit of GBP12.2 billion in June and disappointing expectations for a surplus of GBP2.5 billion.  Elsewhere, the greenback was little changed against the yen, with USD/JPYslipping 0.09% to hit 79.35, but was weaker against the Swiss franc, withUSD/CHF dropping 1.05% to trade at 0.9626. The greenback was lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD losing 0.38% to hit 0.9846, AUD/USD climbing 0.55% to 1.0503 and NZD/USD advancing 0.49% to trade at 0.8126. The Canadian dollar shrugged off data showing that Canadian wholesale sales fell by 0.1% in June, confounding expectations for a 0.4% increase, following a 0.9% increase in May. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.80% to 81.86. Market participants were looking ahead to the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s August policy meeting on Wednesday, amid speculation over how close the U.S. central bank may be to implementing another round of stimulus measures. "

During U.S.afternoon trade, the dollar was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD climbing 0.07% to 1.2342. The euro fell to a session low against the greenback earlier, after the EBC said it was ""absolutely misleading"" to report on decisions that have not yet been taken. Der Spiegel reported Sunday that the ECB may set an interest rate threshold on purchases of euro-area sovereign debt at its next policy meeting in September, beyond which the bank’s bond buying program would be activated. The greenback was fractionally lower against the pound, with GBP/USD edging up 0.04% to 1.5702. The pound remained supported after a string of upbeat U.K. economic data last week indicated that the economy may not be performing as poorly as had been feared. Elsewhere, the dollar was lower against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY down 0.24% to 79.36 and USD/CHF inching down 0.06% to 0.9732. The greenback was broadly lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD inching up 0.01% to 0.9890, AUD/USDrising 0.34% to 1.0452 and NZD/USD adding 0.20% to trade at 0.8090. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, slipped 0.09% to 82.53. Trade looked likely to remain subdued on Monday, with no significant economic data releases on the calendar, while volumes were light with many market participants on summer holidays. "

During Friday’s session, the dollar was flat against the euro, with EUR/USD trading at 1.2354. The single currency found support earlier, after German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed support for European Central Bank intervention in order to ease the effects of the euro zone's financial crisis.  Merkel said that comments by ECB President Mario Draghi, who outlined conditional plans at the start of the month to buy bonds of troubled euro zone governments, were ""completely in line"" with the approach taken by European leaders and urged the bloc to now act swiftly to tackle its debt woes.  But investors remained cautious after official data showed that producer prices in Germany were unchanged in July, compared to expectations for a 0.4% rise and following a 0.4% decline the previous month. In addition, the Bank of Spain said that Spanish banks' bad loans rose to 9.42% of their outstanding portfolios in June, the highest level on record, up from 8.95% a month earlier. Markets were also jittery after a string of mixed U.S. economic reports over the week left investors uncertain over whether the Federal Reserve will soon announce fresh stimulus measures. The greenback was higher against the pound, with GBP/USD falling 0.26% to 1.5692. Elsewhere, the greenback was fractionally higher against the yen, with USD/JPY edging up 0.07% to hit 79.39, and steady against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF dipping 0.04% to trade at 0.9717. In addition, the greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD adding 0.06% to 0.9872,AUD/USD dropping 0.57% to 1.0450 and NZD/USD shedding 0.23% to hit 0.8085. Earlier in the day, official data showed that producer price inflation input in New Zealand rose 0.6% in the second quarter, beating expectations for a 0.2% fall and following a 0.3% increase in the previous quarter. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.07%, to trade at 82.50. Later in the day, the U.S. was to release a preliminary report by the University of Michigan on consumer sentiment and inflation expectations."

1009,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 16, 2012 02:24PM ET</span>",Forex - Greenback slammed on weak U.S. data,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded sharply lower against its rivals Thursday, after a string of tepid U.S. data underlined concerns over the outlook for the country’s economic recovery. During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was down against the euro, with EUR/USD advancing 0.57% to 1.2360. The greenback lost ground after official data showed that manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia-region remained in contraction territory for the fourth straight month in August. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said that its manufacturing index came in at minus 7.1 in August, from July’s reading of minus 12.9, missing expectations for a reading of minus 5. The report came after data on Wednesday showing that a gauge of manufacturing activity in New York fell into contraction territory in August for the first time since October 2011. Earlier Thursday, the Department of Labor said the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week rose to 366,000, a four-week high and slightly above expectations for an increase to 365,000. In a separate report, the U.S. Commerce Department said housing starts fell by 1.1% in July to a seasonally adjusted 0.746 million last month, compared to expectations for a decline of 0.5% to 0.757 million. However,  the number of building permits issued in July rose 6.8% to 0.812 million, compared to expectations for an increase of 1.2% to 0.770 million. The reports sparked fresh speculation that the Federal Reserve may turn to fresh stimulus measures in the near future to shore up growth. The flurry of data came after significantly stronger-than-expected U.S. retail sales numbers for July earlier in the week tempered expectations for another round of quantitative easing by the U.S. central bank. The greenback was also lower against the pound, with GBP/USD rising 0.38% to 1.5743. The pound erased early losses against the greenback after data showed that U.K. retail sales rose unexpectedly in July, indicating that the economy may not be as weak as feared. The Office for National Statistics said U.K. retail sales rose by 0.3% in July, defying expectations for a 0.1% decline, while June’s numbers were revised up to a 0.8% gain from a previously reported increase of 0.1%. Elsewhere, the greenback was higher against the yen, but dropped against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY advancing 0.30% to 79.22 andUSD/CHF falling 0.58% to 0.9715. In Switzerland, the ZEW Centre for European Economic Research said its index of economic sentiment hit a three-month high in August but remained in negative territory, coming in at minus 33.3, from a reading of minus 42.5 in July. The greenback was mixed against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD slipping 0.11% to 0.9881,AUD/USD dipping 0.08% to 1.0496 and NZD/USD rising 0.25% to 0.8093. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.36% to 82.43. "

The pair was likely to find near-term support at 1.2240, the low of August 10 and resistance at 1.2342, the session high. Official data showed that consumer price inflation in the U.S. was flat in July for the second successive month, compared to expectations for a 0.2% increase. Core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy prices, rose 0.1%, less than the expected 0.2% increase, following a 0.2% rise in June. Meanwhile, the New York Federal Reserve’s index of manufacturing conditions deteriorated significantly more-than-expected this month, contracting for the first time since October 2011. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said that its general business conditions index came in at minus 5.8 in August, down sharply from a reading of 7.4 in July.  Analysts had expected the index fall to 6.5 in August. Another report showed that industrial production in the U.S. rose slightly more-than-expected in July, climbing 0.6%, just above expectations for a 0.5% increase. The euro was lower against the pound and the yen, with EUR/GBP down 0.41% to 0.7827 and EUR/JPY sliding 0.34% to 96.68. The euro remained under pressure amid concerns over the economic outlook for the euro zone after data on Tuesday showed that the bloc’s economy contracted 0.2% in the second quarter. Meanwhile, hopes that the European Central Bank will soon move to stem the debt crisis in the euro zone faded, as investors waited for more details of the bank’s proposed bond buying program to emerge."

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar pushed higher against the euro, with EUR/USD slipping 0.04% to 1.2327. The U.S. Commerce Department said retail sales jumped 0.8% last month, after a 0.7% drop in June, surpassing expectations for a 0.3% increase. The euro rose to a session high against the greenback earlier, after data showed that Germany’s economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter, slightly better than expectations for 0.2% growth, while France’s economy stagnated, beating expectations for a 0.1% contraction. But the single currency drifted lower after official data showed that the euro zone economy contracted by 0.2% in the three months to June, in line with expectations, bringing the annualized rate of contraction to 0.4%. Overall market sentiment continued to be underpinned by expectations that recent indications of a slowdown in global growth would prompt world central banks to implement more easing measures to spur the economic recovery. The greenback was also higher against the pound, with GBP/USD dipping 0.04% to 1.5677. The pound pushed higher against the greenback earlier, after official data showing that consumer inflation in the U.K. rose unexpectedly in July dampened expectations for near-term quantitative easing by the Bank of England. The Office for National Statistics said the rate of consumer price inflation accelerated to a seasonally adjusted 2.6% in July from 2.4% the previous month. Analysts had expected CPI to ease slightly to 2.3%. Elsewhere, the greenback climbed to a one-month high against the yen and gained ground against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY advancing 0.55% to 78.44 and USD/CHF easing up 0.10% to 0.9749. The yen came under pressure after the minutes of the Bank of Japan’s August meeting indicated that policymakers have not ruled out further stimulus measures to bolster growth. The greenback was broadly higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD inching up 0.03% to 0.9927,AUD/USD down 0.30% to 1.0485 and NZD/USD losing 0.41% to hit 0.8056.

Greek gross domestic product contracted by 6.2% in the three months to June, less than the 7.0% contraction forecast by economists and slightly less than the 6.5% contraction seen in the first quarter. But sentiment on the euro remained fragile amid uncertainty over the details and timing of proposed European Central Bank bond buying, aimed at lowering Spanish and Italian borrowing costs. Elsewhere, the greenback inched down against the pound, with GBP/USD ticking up 0.06% to 1.5696 and was weaker against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF down 0.55% to 0.9719. The greenback edged higher against the yen, with USD/JPY inching up 0.05% to 78.30. Weak data out of Japan earlier fuelled expectations that world central banks will implement more easing measures to spur the economic recovery. Official data showed that Japan’s economy grew just 0.3% in the three months to June, half as much as expectations for a 0.6% expansion, from an upwardly revised 1.2% in the first quarter, as export demand was hit by the debt crisis in the euro zone. The greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD rising 0.26% to 0.9935, AUD/USD shedding 0.56% to trade at 1.0516 and NZD/USD down 0.50% to 0.8089. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.29% to 82.39. Trade looked likely to remain subdued on Monday, with no significant economic data releases on the calendar, while volumes were light with many market participants on summer holidays."

During European  trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD falling 0.29% to hit 1.2270. Igniting the risk off trade,  the European Central Bank said in its monthly bulletin on Thursday that the economic outlook for the euro zone faced a number of downside risks, with financial market tensions and their potential impact on growth posing the key threats. The ECB revised down its forecast for economic growth to 0.6% in 2013, down from 1% previously and forecast a 0.3% contraction in growth this year, slightly worse than its previous forecast of for a 0.2% contraction. In addition, optimism that the ECB will soon move to cut high Spanish and Italian borrowing costs faded as investors waited for more details of the bank’s proposed bond buying program to emerge. Also Friday, official data showed that industrial production in France was unexpectedly flat in June, disappointing expectations for a 0.4% rise and following a downwarldy revised 2.1% decline the previous month. The greenback was also higher against the pound, with GBP/USD falling 0.23% to hit 1.5602. Government data revealed earlier that producer price inflation input in the U.K. rose less-than-expected in July, ticking up 1.3%, after a 2.9% fall the previous month, disappoiting expectations for a 1.5% rise. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the yen but higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY edging down 0.15% to hit 78.45 andUSD/CHF rising 0.29% to hit 0.9790. In addition, the greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD adding 0.19% to hit 0.9930, AUD/USD dropping 0.56% to hit 1.0520 and NZD/USD declining 0.30% to hit 0.8096. Earlier in the session, the Reserve Bank of Australia raised its 2012 growth forecast on stronger-than-expected household demand, while saying the sustained currency strength could prove more of a drag on the economy than in the past. The export-related currencies also came under pressure after official data showed that China's trade surplus narrowed unexpectedly in July, dropping to USD25.1 billion from a USD31.7 billion surplus.  The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up -%, to trade at -. The greenback also found support after Thursday's strong U.S. economic data dampened speculation that the Federal Reserve may announce a third round of quantitative easing in the near future.  Later in the day, the U.S. was to release official data on import prices. "

The pair was likely to find support at 1.2224, the low of July 30 and resistance at 1.2386, the session high. The greenback was lifted when the Department of Labor reported the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. declined to 361,000 last week, from an upwardly revised 367,000 in the previous week, against expectations for an increase to 370,000. A separate report indicated the U.S. trade deficit dropped to USD42.9 billion in June, its lowest level in two-and-a-half years on the back of lower oil prices, from a downwardly revised USD48.0 billion the previous month. Analysts had expected a U.S. trade deficit of USD47.5 billion in June. Sentiment on the euro was hit by fading optimism that the European Central Bank will soon move to stem the debt crisis in the euro zone, as investors waited for more details of the bank’s proposed bond buying program to emerge.

Official data showed that consumer inflation slowed in July from the previous month, indicating that China’s central bank has more scope for monetary easing, following interest rates cuts in June and July. The euro was lower against the pound and the yen, with EUR/GBP down 0.25% to 0.7877 and EUR/JPY slipping 0.13% to 96.84. In the U.K., official data showed that the trade deficit jumped to GBP10.1 billion in June, up from GBP8.36 billion in May, on the back of a 7% drop in exports. Analysts had expected the U.K. trade deficit to tick up to GBP8.6 billion in June. The data was released one day after the Bank of England said that the U.K. economy would barely grow this year and cut its forecasts for the coming years in its quarterly inflation report. "

1159,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 08, 2012 01:57PM ET</span>",Forex - Greenback mixed on ECB hopes,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded mixed against its rivals Wednesday, as market sentiment remained supported by expectations for central bank action to manage the euro zone debt crisis,  while the pound held gains following comments by Bank of England Governor Mervyn King. During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD falling 0.34% to 1.2357. Market sentiment waned after weaker-than-expected German economic data indicated that the effects of the long running debt crisis are continuing to take a toll on the region’s largest economy.   German industrial production fell 0.9% in June, more than forecasts for a 0.8% decline, following an upwardly revised 1.7% gain in May. The euro’s losses were limited amid expectations that the European Central Bank will soon take steps to help lower Spanish and Italian borrowing costs after the bank indicated last week that it may restart its bond buying program. The greenback was lower against the pound, with GBP/USD advancing 0.30% to 1.5667. The pound strengthened against the greenback after BoE Governor Mervyn King said that cutting interest rates could be more counterproductive than beneficial. Speaking following the release of the BoE’s quarterly inflation report, Governor King stopped short of ruling out a rate cut in the coming months, but indicated that such a move was unlikely, saying it would damage some financial institutions. But the outlook for sterling remained grim after the BoE cut its forecasts for economic growth, saying the rate of growth in two years time was likely to be around 2% per year, significantly lower than its May forecast for growth of around 2.67%. The central bank said inflation would be just below 1.7% in two years, with broadly balanced risks of it being above or below 2%. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the yen, with USD/JPY retreating 0.32% to 78.35, but pushed higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF rising 0.29% to 0.9715. In Switzerland, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs said Wednesday that the consumer confidence index dropped to minus 17 for the April to July period, down from a reading of minus 8 points in the three months to April, amid growing pessimism over the economic outlook and unemployment. Analysts had expected the index to improve to a reading of minus 4. The greenback was mixed against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD down 0.25% to 0.9944, AUD/USDclimbing 0.16% to 1.0570 and NZD/USD dipping 0.07% to 0.8155. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.13% to 82.41. "

The pair was likely to find support at 1.2241, Monday’s low and near-term resistance at 1.2242, Monday’s high and a one-month high. Expectations that the ECB will soon take steps to help lower Spanish and Italian borrowing costs have been building since central bank head Mario Draghi indicated last week that the bank may restart its bond buying program. The euro’s gain were capped by concerns over how effective the ECB’s new bond buying program would be, in the light of differences from the bank’s existing scheme. Draghi also said that any steps by the bank were conditional on euro zone governments experiencing difficulty on bond markets activating the bloc’s bailout funds to purchase government bonds and accepting strict conditions and supervision. Earlier Tuesday, a raft of weak economic data out of the euro zone underlined concerns over the impact of the long running debt crisis on the outlook for growth in the region. German factory orders tumbled 1.7% in June, almost twice as much as expectations for a 1.0% decline.  A separate report showed that Italian gross domestic product contracted by 0.7% in the second quarter, slightly worse than expectations for a 0.6% contraction. The euro was lower against the pound, with EUR/GBP slipping 0.14% to 0.7936 but pushed higher against the yen, with EUR/JPY climbing 0.72% to 97.71. Later in the day, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke was to speak at an event in Washington DC. "

During U.S. morning trade, the dollar turned slightly lower against the euro, with EUR/USD easing up 0.18% to 1.2410. However, sentiment on the euro remained fragile after the ECB indicated last week that it may restart its bond buying program, to help lower Spanish and Italian borrowing costs. Investors remained wary amid concerns over how effective the ECB’s new bond buying program would be, in the light of differences from the bank’s existing scheme. ECB leader Mario Draghi also said any such action was conditional on euro zone governments experiencing difficulty on bond markets applying to the bloc’s bailout funds to purchase government bonds and accepting strict conditions and supervision. Renewed concerns that Spain may yet request a full-scale sovereign bailout kept the yield on the country’s 10-year bonds hovering close to the critical 7% threshold widely seen as unsustainable if a country is to remain solvent. Meanwhile, data on Friday showing an unexpected increase in the U.S. unemployment rate last month fuelled expectations for another round of quantitative easing from the Federal Reserve. The greenback was higher against the pound, with GBP/USD down 0.15% to hit 1.5619. The pound came under pressure amid concerns that the Bank of England will cut its forecast for growth in Wednesday’s quarterly inflation report, increasing the likelihood for further stimulus measures from the central bank. Earlier Monday, a report by mortgage lender Halifax showed that U.K. house prices fell by 0.6% in July, slightly more than expectations for a 0.5% decline, indicating that the pattern of broadly stable house prices is remaining unchanged. Elsewhere, the greenback was down against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY falling 0.37% to trade at 78.18 and USD/CHF down 0.23% to 0.9679. The greenback was broadly lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD down 0.15% to 0.9996,AUD/USD inching up 0.08% to 1.0575 and NZD/USD adding 0.30% to trade at 0.8212. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.22% to 82.23.

However, the U.S. unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 8.3%, from 8.2% in the preceding month, keeping alive speculation over the possibility of further monetary stimulus.

The single currency rally was fueled after official data showed earlier that retail sales in the euro zone rose 0.1% in June, beating expectations for a 0.1% decline and following a 0.8% rise the previous month.  However, sentiment on the euro remained in jeopardy after ECB President Draghi said the bank may undertake bond purchases in order to bring down the ""exceptionally high"" borrowing costs of stressed euro zone members, but provided no specific details on how and when these activities may be carried out. Draghi also said that any such action by the ECB was conditional on euro zone governments experiencing difficulty on bond markets activating the bloc’s bailout funds to purchase government bonds and accepting strict conditions and supervision. The statement disappointed market expectations for bold steps to counter the debt crisis, which have been building since Draghi pledged last week to do whatever is necessary to preserve the euro.

The data came one day after a report showing that manufacturing activity in the U.K. contracted at the fastest pace in more than three years in July, fuelling expectations for another round of easing by the central bank in the coming months. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the traditional safe haven yen, but pushed higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY losing 0.29% to trade at 78.19 and USD/CHF rising 0.62% to 0.9889.

The pair was likely to find support at 1.2116, the low of July 26 and resistance at 1.2335, Wednesday’s high. Depressing the single currency, Draghi stated the bank may undertake bond purchases in order to bring down the ""exceptionally high"" borrowing costs of stressed euro zone members, but provided no explicit details on how and when these activities may be carried out.

The statement disappointed market expectations for bold steps to counter the debt crisis, which have been building since Draghi pledged last week to do whatever is necessary to preserve the euro. The ECB left interest rates unchanged at a record low 0.75% earlier. The euro had rallied against the greenback ahead of the press conference, buoyed by expectations for a decisive policy response by the central bank and after a successful Spanish bond auction. Earlier Thursday, Spain auctioned EUR3.13 billion of government bonds, the top end of the targeted range, but borrowing costs were higher while demand was weaker. Spain’s Treasury sold EUR1.05 billion of 10-year bonds at an average yield of 6.64%, slightly up from 6.43% last month. Following the auction, the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds hit an intra-day low of 6.63%, before climbing back above 7% as markets digested Draghi’s remarks. The euro turned lower against the pound and the yen, with EUR/GBP giving back % to trade at 0.7854 and EUR/JPY down sharply 0.86% to 95.06. In the U.S., the Department of Labor said the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance last week rose to a seasonally adjusted 365,000, from an upwardly revised 357,000 in the preceding week. Analysts had expected initial jobless claims to rise to 370,000 last week. "

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was little changed against the euro, with EUR/USD easing down 0.03% to 1.2301. Keeping the greenback in check, the U.S. central bank was expected to stop short of announcing a third round of quantitative easing measures, but to indicate that it remained ready to act to spur economic growth if necessary. Earlier in the day, the Institute for Supply Management said that its U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to 49.8 in July from 49.7 in the preceding month, but remained below the 50 level that separates contraction from expansion.   Analysts had expected the ISM manufacturing PMI to come in at 50.2. The data came after payroll processor ADP said the U.S. private sector added a seasonally adjusted 163,000 jobs in July, beating expectations for an increase of 120,000.  June’s figure was revised down to 172,000, slightly lower that the initial estimate of 176,000. The euro remained supported by lingering optimism that the European Central Bank would unveil major steps to counter the debt crisis in the euro zone at its policy meeting on Thursday, after ECB head Mario Draghi pledged last week to do whatever is necessary to preserve the euro. The greenback was higher against the pound, with GBP/USD falling 0.44% to hit 1.5609, following a report earlier showing that the U.K. manufacturing sector contracted more-than-expected in July. The Markit/CIPS U.K. manufacturing PMI dropped to 45.4 in July, the lowest level since March 2009, from a downwardly revised 48.4 in June and well below forecasts for a reading of 48.7. The weak data fuelled expectations for more monetary easing by the Bank of England in the coming months, after data last week showed that the U.K. economy contracted in the three months to June, extending the recession into a third quarter. Earlier Wednesday, a report revealed U.K. house prices fell at the fastest annual rate in almost three years in July. Elsewhere, the greenback edged higher against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY inching up 0.01% to 78.13 and USD/CHF easing up 0.06% to 0.9768. The greenback remained slightly lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD slipping 0.19% to 1.0013,AUD/USD edging up 0.06% to 1.0511 and NZD/USD climbing 0.39% to trade at 0.8120. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, inched up 0.02% to 82.74. "

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD rising 0.29% to 1.2296. Expectations have been increasing that the ECB will announce bold measures to tackle the long running debt crisis after central bank head Mario Draghi pledged last week to do whatever is necessary to preserve the euro. However, investors remained wary amid concerns that an inadequate policy response by the ECB could send markets lower. Germany is opposed to granting a banking license to the bloc’s bailout fund and to the resumption of the ECB’s bond buying program. Market participants were also eyeing the outcome of the Fed’s policy setting meeting on Wednesday, amid speculation over whether the U.S. central bank will indicate if further quantitative easing measures are imminent. Meanwhile, the euro was little changed after official data showed that the rate of consumer price inflation in the euro zone remained steady at 2.4% in July. A separate report showed that the unemployment rate in the bloc rose to 11.2%, a new record high in July. Germany’s unemployment rate remained steady at 6.8% in July, but Italy’s unemployment rate rose to 10.8% in June, the highest level since quarterly records began in 1999. The greenback was higher against the pound, with GBP/USD falling 0.23% to 1.5674. The pound remained under pressure after data last week showing a steeper than expected contraction in U.K. economic growth in the second quarter. The Bank of England was to hold its monthly rate setting meeting on Thursday, but was not widely expected to announce any change to current monetary policy. Elsewhere, the greenback was steady against the yen, with USD/JPY easing 0.01% to hit 78.16, and fell against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF retreating 0.29% to trade at 0.9769. Earlier in the day, a report showed that manufacturing activity in Japan remained in contraction territory for the second consecutive month in July.  The greenback was mixed against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD inching up 0.09% to 1.0024,AUD/USD adding 0.15% to 1.0519 and NZD/USD edging up 0.19% to trade at 0.8105. The National Bank of New Zealand said earlier that its index of business confidence rose to 15.1 in July, from a reading of 12.6 the previous month. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.14% to 82.76. Also Tuesday, a U.S. report showed that the Chicago purchasing managers’ index rose to 53.7 in July, from a reading of 52.9 the previous month and defying expectations for a decline to 52.5. In other news, the Conference Board reported U.S. consumer confidence rose to 65.9 in July, from 62.7 in the preceding month, beating expectations for a reading of 61.5. A separate report revealed U.S. personal spending was flat in June, in line with expectations, while personal income rose 0.5%, slightly better than expectations for a 0.4% increase."

Expectations mounted that the ECB is set to announce fresh measures to tackle the crisis at Thursday’s policy meeting, after bank head Mario Draghi pledged last week to do whatever is necessary to preserve the euro. However, investors remained wary amid concerns that the ECB could disappoint market expectations. Italy witnessed the yield on 10-year bonds fall below 6% for the first time since April at an auction of government debt earlier, indicating that investors now see Italian government debt as a somewhat safer investment. But worries over the outlook for the euro zone persisted after official data showed that Spain’s economy contracted 0.4% in the three month to June, extending the recession into a third quarter. A separate report showed that the European Commission’s index of economic sentiment across the euro area dropped to a 34 month low in July, with confidence in Spain, Germany and France all dropping sharply. Meanwhile, investors were looking ahead to the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s policy setting meeting on Wednesday, amid speculation over whether the U.S. central bank will hint at further easing measures. The greenback was also higher against the pound, with GBP/USDshedding 0.33% to trade at 1.5694. In the U.K., official data showed that mortgage approvals fell to the lowest level in 18 months in June, while a separate report showed that net lending grew at the slowest pace in 12 months in July, underlining concerns over economic weakness. The data came after data last week showed that the U.K. economy contracted significantly more-than-expected in the second quarter. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the yen, with USD/JPYdeclining 0.33% to hit 78.18, but was higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF climbing 0.60% to trade at 0.9810. The greenback was mixed against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD dipping 0.04% to 1.0025, AUD/USD adding 0.10% to trade at 1.0492 and NZD/USD easing 0.07% to 0.8087. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose 0.34% to 82.96. Elsewhere Monday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner expressed confidence in economic reform efforts underway in the euro zone ahead of talks with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and ECB chief Mario Draghi later in the day."

During European afternoon trade, the dollar moved lower against the euro, with EUR/USD up 0.03% to 1.2289. The euro rose to a session high earlier, after ECB President Draghi said on Thursday that the bank will do whatever is necessary to preserve the single currency. In a speech in London, Draghi appeared to indicate that the ECB would be prepared to intervene to lower Spanish and Italian bond yields, saying that government borrowing costs would fall within the central bank’s mandate if they interfered with the 'transmission' of monetary policy. But investors remained cautious amid fresh doubts about whether the ECB will take bold measures to tackle the sovereign debt crisis. However, Germany’s Bundesbank has expressed concerns that the restarting of the ECB’s bond repurchase program is not the ideal way to handle the region’s debt crisis dampening commodity sentiment. In addition Friday, official data indicated Spain's unemployment rate rose slightly less-than-expected in the second quarter, ticking up to 24.6% from 24.4% in the previous quarter. Analysts had expected Spain's unemployment rate to rise to 24.9% in the second quarter.  The greenback was lower against the pound, with GBP/USD rising 0.18% to 1.5714. Elsewhere, the greenback was steady against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY easing 0.05% to 78.15 and USD/CHF dropping inching up 0.06% to 0.9784. Earlier in the day, the KOF Economic Research Agency said that its economic barometer rose to 1.43 in July from 1.15 the previous month, beating expectations for a reading at 1.25. In Japan, official data indicated retail sales rose less-than-expected in June, ticking up 0.2% after a 3.6% increase the previous month. Analysts had expected retail sales to rise 1.2% in June.  The report arrived after official data showed that Tokyo's core consumer price inflation, which excludes fresh food, fell 0.6% in July, in line with expectations and after a 0.6% decline the previous month. The greenback was lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD down 0.15% to 1.0083, AUD/USD rising 0.32% to trade at 1.0428 and NZD/USD advancing 0.32% to 0.8045. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.02% to trade at 82.88. Later in the day, the U.S. was to publish advanced data on second quarter economic growth followed by a report by the University of Michigan on consumer sentiment. Economists are expecting the U.S. GDP to have slowed to an annual rate of 1.4% in the second quarter, from 1.9% in the previous three months. "

Pending home sales for May were revised down to a 5.4% increase from a previously reported gain of 5.9%.

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD climbing 0.80 % to hit 1.2159. The euro strengthened after ECB Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said that there were some grounds for giving the European Stability Mechanism a banking license, which would increase its firepower to fight the debt crisis in the euro zone. Markets have been hit by fears that the ESM would not be sufficiently large enough to cope in the event that Spain will require a full-scale sovereign bailout, in addition to the rescue package already agreed for its bank’s. Earlier in the day, the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds rose to a euro-era record high of 7.71%, before easing back to 7.40%, still above the 7% threshold widely considered unsustainable in the long run. Meanwhile, weak economic data out of German indicated that the euro zone’s largest economy is being affected by the debt crisis in the bloc. The German research institute Ifo said its Business Climate Index fell to 103.3 in July, the lowest level since June 2010, from a reading of 105.2 in June. The dollar came under pressure after the Wall Street Journal reported that a number of Fed officials are moving closer to implementing fresh measures to shore-up growth and bolster employment, following recent disappointing economic data. The greenback eased lower against the pound, with GBP/USD  up 0.04% to 1.5512. Sentiment on sterling was hit after official data showed that U.K. gross domestic product contracted by 0.7% in the second quarter, far more than the 0.2% contraction economists had forecast, extending Britain's recession into a third quarter as an extra public holiday for the Diamond Jubilee and poor weather weighed on economic activity. Elsewhere, the greenback traded lower against the yen, with USD/JPY easing down 0.05% to 78.13, and against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF declining 0.80% to trade at 0.9877. Earlier Wednesday, the Bank of Japan said it would not hesitate to ease monetary policy further if the yen's appreciation severely threatens Japan's economic recovery.  The greenback was lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD falling 0.73% to 1.0147, AUD/USD climbing 1.04% to 1.0329 and NZD/USD rising 0.20% to trade at 0.7861. The Australian dollar was little changed earlier, following official data showing that domestic consumer price inflation rose 0.5% in the second quarter, slightly below expectations for a 0.6% increase, after a 0.1% rise the previous quarter. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.51% to trade at 83.64. Further depressing the greenback Wednesday, official data indicated U.S. new home sales fell more-than-expected in June, dropping 8.4% to a seasonally adjusted 350,000 unit annual rate, compared to expectations for a decline of 2.6% to 372,000."

1426,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 24, 2012 01:54PM ET</span>",Forex - Greenback moves higher against rivals on euro zone debt fears,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded higher against most of its counterparts Tuesday, as concerns over the situation in the euro zone intensified, overshadowing improved manufacturing data out of China. During U.S. trade, the dollar moved above the critical two-year high against the euro, with EUR/USD down 0.53% to 1.2055. The single currency suffered broad selling pressure amid fears that Spain will be the next country in the euro zone to require a full-scale bailout after the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds rose to a euro-era high of 7.60%, well above the 7% threshold considered unsustainable if a country is to remain solvent. Earlier Tuesday, Spain successfully auctioned EUR3.02 billion of three and six-month government bonds but at higher yields than in previous auctions. Further adding to the gloom, data indicated that manufacturing activity in Germany slowed to the lowest level in more than three years in July, just one day after rating’s agency Moody’s cut its outlook on Germany to negative from stable. Separate reports showed that manufacturing activity in the euro zone contracted at the fastest pace since May 2009 in July, while the French manufacturing sector contracted at the fastest pace in 38 months. The weak euro zone data offset a report showing that China’s HSBC manufacturing purchasing managers index improved to 49.5 in July, its highest level since February, from a final reading of 48.2 in June.  While the index remained below the 50 level which indicates contraction, the improvement from the previous month eased concerns over a slowdown in the world’s second largest economy. The greenback edged lower against the pound, with GBP/USD easing up 0.13% to hit 1.5525, but pushed higher against the Swiss franc, withUSD/CHF up 0.28% to trade at 0.9938. The greenback slid lower against the safe-haven yen, with USD/JPYdown 0.22% to 78.22. The yen remained supported after Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi reiterated Tuesday that Tokyo was ready to take decisive action against speculative moves or excessive volatility in the yen, in order to shield the largely export based economy from the effects of the currency’s strength The greenback was fractionally lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD inching up 0.05% to 1.0194, AUD/USD inching up 0.07% to 1.0264 and NZD/USD adding 0.15% to trade at 0.7886. In Canada, official data showed that retail sales advanced by a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in May, missing expectations for a gain of 0.5%, after falling by a revised 0.6% in April. However, core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in May, beating expectations for a 0.2% increase. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.50% to 84.18. In other news Tuesday, representatives from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund were holding talks with the Greek government in Athens, aimed at getting the country’s economic reform program back on track, amid ongoing speculation over a possible Greek exit from the euro zone."

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was trading close to a two-year high against the euro, with EUR/USD down 0.22% to 1.2129. Pressuring the single currency, yields on Spanish 10-year bonds was hovering close to 7.50%, above the 7% threshold widely considered unsustainable if a country is to remain solvent, amid growing fears that Spain will need a full-scale bailout after the state of Murcia followed Valencia in requesting financial aid from Madrid over the weekend. The spike in borrowing costs came despite euro zone finance ministers approving a package of as much as EUR100 billion to bailout Spain’s banks on Friday. Market sentiment found some support after the International Monetary Fund said it was to due start talks with Greece on Tuesday, aimed getting the country’s economic reform program back on track. The announcement came after German media reports suggested that the IMF would no longer take part in providing financial aid for Greece, fuelling fears that the country would eventually exit the euro zone. The greenback was higher against the pound and the Swiss franc, with GBP/USD dropping 0.70% to hit 1.5510 and USD/CHF adding 0.36% to trade at 0.9913. However, the greenback was weaker against the Japanese yen, with USD/JPY easing lower 0.10% to 78.41. Earlier in the day, Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi reiterated that Tokyo was ready to take decisive steps against speculative moves or excessive volatility in the yen, amid concerns over the impact on the country’s largely export driven economy from the stronger currency.However,  the USD was sharply higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD rising 0.48% to 1.0176,AUD/USD tumbling 1.06% to 1.0267 and NZD/USD down 1.29% to 0.7892. The Australian dollar was little changed earlier Monday, after official data showed that domestic producer price inflation rose 0.5% in June, outstripping expectations for a 0.3% increase, following a 0.3% drop in May. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.23% to 83.81."

The number has been down trending, having hit the lowest level since August 2009. In addition, further pressuring the single currency,  a gauge for manufacturing is forecasted to be 45.2 this month.

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, withEUR/USD shedding 0.21% to trade at 1.2257. The euro turned lower ahead of the vote in Berlin after German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble warned that Spain's government should be ultimately responsible for European aid to its banks. Earlier in the day, Spain saw borrowing costs rise sharply at an auction of government debt, fuelling fears that the country may need a full bailout. Following the auction the yield on the country’s 10-year bonds was at 7.02%, breaching the critical 7% threshold, widely viewed as unsustainable in the long run. In the U.S., reports showing that existing home sales fell unexpectedly in June, while jobless claims rose more-than-forecast last week fuelled concerns over the outlook for the economy. The National Association of Realtors said that existing home sales fell by 5.4% to a seasonally adjusted 4.37 million units in June, defying expectations for a modest increase to 4.63 million units. The data came after the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance last week rose by 34,000 to a seasonally adjusted 386,000, compared to expectations for an increase to 365,000. The previous week’s figure was revised up to 352,000 from a previously reported 350,000. A separate report showed that manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia-region contracted for the third consecutive month in July. The greenback was lower against the pound, with GBP/USD up 0.36% to 1.5708. Sterling remained supported as robust corporate earnings lifted equity markets and bolstered demand for higher-yielding assets. In the U.K., official data showed that retail rose less-than-expected in June, inching up 0.1%, disappointing expectations for a 0.6% gain, as wet weather hurt demand for outdoor products. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the yen, with USD/JPYdown 0.19% to 78.64, but pushed higher against the Swiss franc, withUSD/CHF rising 0.20% to 0.9797. The greenback was broadly lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD shedding 0.28% to trade at 1.0072, AUD/USD up 0.59% to 1.0422 and NZD/USD up 0.40% to hit 0.8033. A report earlier showed that Canadian wholesale sales rose by 0.9% in May, easily beating expectations for a 0.2% increase and gaining for the fourth consecutive month.

The data came after the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance last week rose by 34,000 to a seasonally adjusted 386,000, compared to expectations for an increase to 365,000. The previous week’s figure was revised up to 352,000 from a previously reported 350,000. A separate report showed that manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia-region contracted for the third consecutive month in July. Elsewhere, the euro slumped to a three-and-a-half year low against the pound, with EUR/GBP falling 0.65% to 0.7795 and dropped to a six-week low against the yen, with EUR/JPY down 0.65% to 96.16. "

1526,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 18, 2012 12:08PM ET</span>","Forex - EUR/USD lower on strong U.S. housing numbers, German uncertainty","Investing.com - The euro traded off against the U.S. dollar  Wednesday as bullish housing data lifted the greenback in the wake of the German Chancellor’s uncertainty pressuring the single currency.EUR/USD bounced from 1.2216, the session low, to hit 1.2266 during U.S. afternoon trade, lower by 0.23%. The pair was likely to find near-term support at 1.2174, Monday’s low and resistance at 1.2315, Tuesday’s high. Concerns over the outlook for the U.S. eased after official data showed that the number of U.S. housing starts rose more-than-expected in June, hitting the highest level since April 2010. The Commerce Department reported U.S. housing starts rose by 6.9% in June to a seasonally adjusted 0.760 million, compared to expectations for a gain of 5.2%. Housing starts for May were revised up to 0.711 million units, up from a previously reported 0.708 million units. The report revealed the number of building permits issued fell 3.7% in June to a 755,000 unit pace. The data came one day after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke offered a downbeat view of the U.S. economic outlook in testimony to the Senate, but failed to explicitly indicate if additional stimulus measures are imminent. Bernanke was due to testify on the economy and monetary policy in front of the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday. The euro came under pressure in the European session after German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was not certain the European project would be successful, but reiterated that she was optimistic in spite of the current difficulties. Meanwhile, the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds was at 6.93%, nearing the critical 7% threshold widely viewed as unsustainable in the long run, amid fresh concerns over Madrid’s finances. The euro was hovering close to a three-and-a-half year low against the pound, with EUR/GBP down 0.27% to 0.7835 and was also lower against the yen, with EUR/JPY sliding 0.47% to trade at 96.73.  In addition Wednesday, Germany auctioned more than EUR4 billion of two-year government bonds at negative yields for the first time at this type of auction, reflecting sustained investor concerns over the debt crisis in the region. "

During U.S. morning trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD down 0.21% to 1.2247.. In keenly awaited testimony to the U.S. Senate, Bernanke delivered a negative assessment of the outlook for the U.S. economy, saying growth had lost momentum in the first half of the year and added that efforts to reduce the U.S. unemployment rate were progressing “frustratingly” slowly. However, he refrained from indicating whether the Fed would embark on a third round of quantitative easing to stimulate the economy, but reiterated that the central bank was prepared to take further action to support the economic recovery, if necessary. In the euro zone, Spain saw short-term borrowing costs fall at an auction of 12 and 18-month government bonds earlier, but the yield on the country’s 10-year bonds was at 6.76%, remaining close to the critical 7% threshold amid sustained concerns over the country’s finances. The greenback also pushed higher against the pound, with GBP/USD losing 0.11% to trade at 1.5619. Earlier Tuesday, official data showed that consumer price inflation in the U.K. rose at the slowest pace since November 2009 in June, rising 2.4% year-on-year after a 2.8% increase in May. The unexpectedly weak data fuelled expectations that the Bank of England is unlikely to exit its monetary easing policy in the near term, after the central bank increased the size of its asset purchase program earlier this month. Elsewhere, the greenback was higher against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY adding 0.31% to trade at 79.10 and USD/CHF rising 0.23% to 0.9810. The greenback was mixed against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD  down 0.10% to 1.0140,AUD/USD higher by0.34% to 1.0284 and NZD/USD down 0.52% to 0.7938. The Bank of Canada left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1.00% in a widely expected decision earlier and maintained a hawkish stance in its rate statement, saying “some modest withdrawal of the present considerable monetary policy stimulus may become appropriate.”  The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, climbed 0.20% to 83.39. "
1548,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 17, 2012 12:06PM ET</span>",Forex - Bernanke's words sink EUR/USD,"Investing.com - The euro fell to a session low against the U.S. dollar Tuesday, prior to bouncing,  after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke refrained from suggesting that the Federal Reserve is considering fresh stimulus in keenly anticipated testimony to the U.S. Senate.EUR/USD hit 1.2217 during U.S. morning trade, the session low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.2233, still off 0.31%. The pair was likely to find support at 1.2161, last Friday’s low and a two-year low and resistance at 1.2288, Monday’s high. Bernanke delivered a negative assessment of the outlook for the U.S. economy, saying growth had lost momentum in the first half of the year and added that efforts to reduce the U.S. unemployment rate were progressing “frustratingly” slowly.

Meanwhile, data indicated German economic sentiment deteriorated for the third consecutive month in July, as concerns over the euro zone’s ongoing debt crisis continued to weigh. The ZEW Centre for Economic Research reported that its index of German economic sentiment fell to minus 19.6 in July from June’s reading of minus 16.9, but was slightly better than expectations for a decline to minus 20.0. The euro turned lower against the pound and the yen, with EUR/GBP falling 0.14% to 0.7839 and EUR/JPY losing 0.09% to trade at 96.68. In other news Tuesday, official data showed that core consumer price inflation in the U.S. rose 0.2% in June, broadly in line with market expectations, while prices including food and energy costs were flat. A separate report showed that industrial production in the U.S. rose 0.4% in June, just above expectations for a 0.3% increase. "

During U.S. morning trade, the dollar was down against the euro, with EUR/USD up 0.29% to 1.2284, off an earlier low of 1.2176. Weighing on the greenback, the Commerce Department reported U.S. retail sales fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in June, confounding expectations for a 0.2% increase, after a 0.2% drop in May. It was the first time retail sales had dropped in three consecutive months since late 2008. Core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, declined for the second consecutive month, dropping 0.4%, against expectations for an increase of 0.1%, after falling by 0.4% in May. The data fuelled speculation over the possibility of another round of easing from the U.S. central bank, ahead of Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's testimony on the economic outlook to the U.S. Senate on Tuesday and Wednesday. In June, Bernanke said the Fed remained prepared to take additional steps to support economic growth if necessary, including additional asset purchases. The euro remained under pressure from sustained concerns over the region’s debt crisis, as uncertainty over whether some bondholders could be forced to accept losses under the terms of Spain's bank bailout weighed. Meanwhile, Germany’s constitutional court announced that it will deliver a ruling on whether the euro zone’s permanent bailout fund contravenes the German constitution on September 12, disappointing hopes for an earlier decision. The greenback erased gains against the pound, with GBP/USD up 0.27% to1.5617. Earlier Monday, the International Monetary Fund said that the outlook for growth in the U.K. had deteriorated more than any other G8 nation over the past three months, when it released its forecasts for global growth. The IMF said it now expected the U.K. economy to expand by just 0.2% this year, down from 0.8% in April and by 1.4% in 2013. Elsewhere, the greenback was down against the broadly firmer yen, with USD/JPY shedding 0.55% to trade at 78.74, but remained marginally higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF up 0.09% to 0.9813. The greenback was mixed against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD up 0.21% to 1.0158, AUD/USDinching up 0.06% to trade at 1.0233 and NZD/USD rising 0.09% to hit 0.7965. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, dipped 0.28% to 83.17. The IMF said it now expects global growth of 3.5% in 2012, down from a forecast of 3.6% three months ago and revised down its outlook for growth next year to 3.9% from a previous forecast of 4.1%. "

The New York Fed reported that its general business conditions index rose to 7.4 in July from 2.3 the previous month, outstripping expectations for a reading of 4.0. However, sentiment on the euro remained weak amid uncertainty over whether some bondholders could be forced to accept losses under the terms of Spain's bank bailout.  The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds rose to 6.81% earlier, re-approaching the critical 7% threshold, widely seen as unsustainable in the long run. The yield on Italian 10-year bonds ticked up to 6.16%. Meanwhile, Germany’s constitutional court announced that it will deliver a ruling on whether the euro zone’s permanent bailout fund contravenes the German constitution on September 12, disappointing hopes for an earlier decision.

During U.S. afternoon  trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD sliding 0.37% to hit 1.2196, the lowest level since July 2010. Single currency sentiment remained fragile after the European Central Bank’s monthly bulletin reiterated that downside risks have materialized and that growth in the region will remain weak. Traders were also nervous after the head of Italy's business group warned that Italy’s economy will shrink by more than 2.4% this year, a deeper contraction than previously expected. Long lasting concern over the deteriorating situation in Spain following Wednesday's announcement of EUR65 billion in new austerity measures also weighed. Market analysts warned that the fresh budget cuts were likely to drag Spain’s economy deeper in to a recession. Meanwhile, in the U.S., minutes of the Fed’s June policy-setting meeting released Wednesday revealed that only a few board members thought that more asset purchases would be necessary. Several other officials indicated that more action could be warranted only if growth slows, risks intensified or if inflation seemed likely to fall “persistently” below their goal Just four Fed officials mentioned more quantitative easing in their individual forecasts, two saying they supported more easing and two saying they would consider it.

The court stated a decision could take months rather than weeks due to the complexity of the ruling. Without German backing, the ESM, which was originally meant to start on July 1, then delayed to July 9, cannot come into effect. Meanwhile, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced EUR65 billion of new austerity measures earlier in the day, in an effort to meet new budget-deficit targets agreed with euro zone partners. However, market analysts warned that the fresh austerity measures were likely to drag Spain’s economy deeper in to a recession. But the greenback was down against the pound, with GBP/USD gaining 0.04% to hit 1.5525. Sterling remained supported after data on Tuesday showed that manufacturing production rose by 1.2% in May, blowing past expectations for a more modest 0.1% gain, after falling by 0.8% in April. A separate report showed that the U.K.’s goods trade deficit narrowed more-than-expected in May, as exports picked up from the previous month. Elsewhere, the greenback was higher against the yen and little changed the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY adding 0.25% to hit 79.63 and USD/CHF edging down 0.03% to hit 0.9801. Market participants looked forward to the outcome of Bank of Japan’s policy setting meeting on Thursday, amid speculation the central bank could increase its asset purchases. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD falling 0.25% to hit 1.0201, AUD/USD rising 0.54% to hit 1.0246 and NZD/USD adding 0.44% to hit 0.7975. In Canada, a government report showed that the nation’s trade deficit widened modestly to CAD0.8 billion in May from a deficit of CAD0.6 billion in April, as exports were relatively unchanged and imports increased 0.4%. Meanwhile, the dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.05%, to trade at 83.52. Data released earlier in the day showed that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed to USD48.7 billion in May from deficit of USD50.6 billion in April, as exports inched up 0.2% and imports fell 0.7%.

However, market analysts warned that the fresh austerity measures were likely to drag Spain’s economy deeper in to a recession. The fresh budget cuts come a day after the conclusion of the latest meeting of euro zone finance ministers.   While the ministers agreed to grant Spain an extra year through 2014 to reach its deficit reduction targets, they did not come up with a final figure for aid for the country's ailing banks but said some EUR30 billion would be available by the end of this month. Earlier in the day, Germany saw borrowing costs fall to a record low at an auction of 10-year government bonds, as sustained concerns over the region’s debt crisis continued to boost demand for safe haven bunds. Elsewhere, the euro was trading close to a three-and-a-half year low against the pound with EUR/GBP falling 0.10%, to hit 0.7886. In addition Wednesday, official data indicated  that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed to USD48.7 billion in May from deficit of USD50.6 billion in April, whose figure was revised from a deficit of USD50.1 billion.

The single currency anticipated talks between EU finance ministers, after euro zone officials agreed on Monday to make EUR30 billion in aid available to assist Spain’s struggling banking sector by the end of the month, while also supporting plans to extend Spain’s deficit target deadline by one year to 2014. They made no apparent progress, however, on activating the bloc's rescue funds to intervene in bond markets and bring down Spain and Italy’s spiraling borrowing costs. Spain’s 10-year government bonds eased to 6.74% earlier, moving below the critical 7% threshold which is widely seen as unsustainable in the long term. Markets were also jittery as Germany's top court was due to decide whether the EU's permanent bailout fund is compatible with national law, potentially leading to deeper fiscal integration within the region. Earlier in the day, official data showed that French industrial production tumbled 1.9% in May, far more than expectations for a 0.9% fall and following a 1.4% rise the previous month.

1694,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 09, 2012 01:15PM ET</span>",Forex - Greenback mixed on meeting anticipation,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded mixed against its major counterparts Monday, as investors remained cautious ahead of a meeting of the region’s finance ministers due to begin later in the day. During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar moved lower against the euro, with EUR/USD up 0.19% to hit 1.2309. Single currency sentiment remained under pressure as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi reiterated comments made last week following the bank’s decision to cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low of 0.75%, saying that economic indicators for the second quarter point to weakening growth in the euro zone. Speaking before the European Parliament in Brussels, Draghi added that inflation will most likely decline further in 2012 and fall below 2% in 2013.  The comments came as the yield on Spain’s 10-year government bonds climbed to 7.11% earlier, well above the 7% threshold, widely seen as unsustainable, ahead of a meeting of euro zone finance ministers later Monday.  Euro zone officials were expected to discuss a plan announced last month and designed to help the region’s indebted countries and their struggling banking systems. The euro tumbled to a two-year low against the greenback earlier in the day, as concerns over the outlook for global growth persisted after disappointing economic reports from the U.S. and China. Meanwhile, the greenback was lower against the pound, with GBP/USD adding 0.23% to hit 1.5524. Sterling’s gains were limited after the Bank of England said last week that “the weaker outlook for U.K. output growth means that the margin of economic slack is likely to be greater and more persistent.” The comments came after BoE policymakers voted to increase its quantitative easing program by GBP50 billion to GBP375 billion, in order to shield the recession hit U.K. economy from the ongoing debt crisis in the euro zone. Elsewhere, the greenback was modestly lower against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY dipping 0.1% to trade at 79.60 andUSD/CHF shedding 0.04% to hit 0.9770. However, the greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD rising 0.05% to hit 1.0201, AUD/USD dropping 0.23% to hit 1.0190 and NZD/USDretreating 0.22% to hit 0.7961. The commodity-linked currencies were hit by concerns over a deeper-than-expected slowdown in China.  The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.13%, to trade at 83.36. "
