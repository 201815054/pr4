143,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 25, 2013 11:15AM ET</span>",Dollar remains mixed vs. rivals after weak U.S. data ,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar remained mixed against the other major currencies on Friday, after the release of disappointing U.S. new home sales data, while fresh hopes of progress in handling the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis continued to support market sentiment. During U.S. morning trade, the dollar was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD climbing 0.66% to 1.3464. The euro strengthened against the greenback after the Ifo Institute for Economic Research said that its index of German business confidence improved to 104.2 in January, from 102.4 the previous month, beating expectations for a rise to 103.0. Separately, the European Central Bank said that banks will repay EUR137.159 billion in three-year loans next week, opting to hand back the money early, signalling that a least parts of the financial system are returning to health. The greenback was also lower against the pound, with GBP/USD adding 0.10% to 1.5803.  Earlier in the day, preliminary data showed that U.K. gross domestic product fell 0.3% in the fourth quarter, compared to expectations for a 0.1% decline, after a 0.9% rise in the previous quarter.  Elsewhere, the greenback was higher against the yen, with USD/JPY advancing 0.74% to trade at 91.00, bit lower against the Swiss franc with USD/CHF dropping 0.51% to 0.9242.  The yen remained under broad selling pressure after Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa reaffirmed on Friday the bank's commitment to maintain powerful monetary easing.  The greenback was mixed against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD advancing 0.64% to 1.0089, AUD/USD slipping 0.22% to 1.0428 and NZD/USD edging up 0.02% to 0.8379.  In Canada, official data showed that core consumer price inflation fell 0.6% in December, more than the expected 0.2% slip, after a flat reading the previous month.  Consumer price inflation, which includes the eight most volatile items, fell 0.6% last month after a 0.2% decline in November, compared to expectations for a 0.2% fall.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.26% to 79.82. Also Friday, the U.S. Census Bureau said that new home sales rose less-than-expected in December, rising by 369,000 units after a 398,000 increase the previous month.  Analysts had expected new home sales to rise by 385,000 units last month."

EUR/USD hit 1.3267 during U.S. morning trade, the pair's lowest since January 16; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3309, dipping 0.02%. The pair was likely to find support at 1.3249, the low of January 11 and resistance at 1.3372, the session high. Industry data showed that U.S. existing home sales fell to 4.94 million in December from 4.99 million the previous month, disappointing expectations for a rise to 5.10 million. Meanwhile, investors were cautious as euro zone ministers were still seeking an agreement on how and when the euro zone's bailout fund, the European Stability Mecanism, can bypass governments and provide direct help to banks.  Separetly, investor confidence was hit by speculation some large German banks could be asked to split their investment banking operations.  Sentiment on the euro remained supported however, after Olli Rehn said that EU finance ministers and the Commission are confident Ireland and Portugal will be able to return to full market financing after their bailouts and will work in the coming months to facilitate that. Earlier Tuesday, the ZEW Centre for Economic Research said that its index of German economic sentiment improved to 31.5 in January from a reading of 6.9 the previous month, blowing past expectations for a rise to 12.0.  A separate report showed that the ZEW index of euro zone economic sentiment jumped to 31.2 this month from 7.6 in December, compared with expectations for a reading of 14.0. The euro was lower against the pound with EUR/GBP slipping 0.21%, to hit 0.8392. Also Tuesday, industry data showed that the index of indutrial order expectations in the U.K. dropped to minus 20 in January from a reading of minus 12 the previous month, disappointing expectations for an improvement to minus 11. The report came after official data showed that public sector net borrowing in the U.K. declined less-than-expected in December, slipping to GBP13.2 billion from GBP14.3 billion the previous month. "
203,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 22, 2013 09:30AM ET</span>",Forex - USD/CAD almost unchanged in cautious trade ,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was almost unchanged against its Canadian counterpart on Tuesday, after the release of tepid Canadian economic data, although fresh hopes for progress on the euro zone front supported sentiment.  USD/CAD hit 0.9946 during early U.S. trade, the pair's highest since January 18; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.9932, easing up 0.02%.  The pair was likely to find support at 0.9910, the session low and resistance at 0.9947, the high of January 18.

Retail sales, including automobiles, rose 0.2% in November, beating expectations for a 0.2% fall, after a 0.5% increase the previous month. Elsewhere, the ZEW Centre for Economic Research said that its indexes of German and euro zone economic sentiment improved far more-than-expected in January, adding to hopes for progress in the handling of the currency bloc's debt crisis.  Sentiment was also supported by upbeat comments by European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn, saying that Ireland and Portugal will be able to return to full market financing after their bailouts.  Meanwhile, markets continued to eye U.S. budget negotiations after Republican leaders in the House of Representatives said they aim to pass on Wednesday a nearly four-month extension of the U.S. debt limit allowing the government to borrow enough to meet its obligations during that period. The loonie was steady against the euro with EUR/CAD inching up 0.06%, to hit 1.3225.  Later in the day, the U.S. was to publish private sector data on existing home sales."

The pair was likely to find support at 88.14, the low of January 17 and resistance at 90.13, the session high.  Following its two-day policy meeting, the BoJ said that from 2014 it would switch to an open-ended approach of buying a certain amount of assets each month without setting a deadline for completing the purchases. The central bank had previously pledged to inject JPY101 trillion into markets with its asset-buying and lending program by the end of this year, but had made no commitment on whether to maintain the balance beyond 2014. In addition, the BoJ doubled its inflation target to 2% in an effort to rid Japan of deflationary pressures, and left interest rates close to zero, as expected. The yen was also higher against the euro with EUR/JPY shedding 0.44%, to hit 118.80. Later in the day, the U.S. was to publish private sector data on existing home sales.

365,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 11, 2013 03:12AM ET</span>","Forex - EUR/USD steady, close to 1-week high ","Investing.com - The euro was steady against the U.S. dollar on Friday, trading close to a one-week high after positive Chinese data and as the single currency remained supported by Thursday's encouraging comments by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi. EUR/USD hit 1.3249 during early European trade, the session low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3262, dipping 0.07%. The pair was likely to find support at 1.3173, the low of December 31 and resistance at 1.3308, the high of December 19 and a multi-month high.  Speaking at the bank’s post-policy meeting press conference Draghi said a gradual economic recovery would begin this year, as structural reforms and actions by the ECB to tackle the region’s debt crisis continued to take effect. The comments came after the ECB left interest rates on hold at 0.75% in a widely anticipated decision earlier, but some market participants had expected Draghi to hint at the possibility of rate cuts later in 2013.  Market sentiment also found support after official data earlier showed that consumer price inflation in China rose to an annualized rate of 2.5% in December from 2.0% the previous month, beating expectations for a rise to 2.3%.  Elsewhere, the euro was higher against the pound, with EUR/GBP adding 0.10% to hit 0.8216 and against the yen, with EUR/JPY rising 0.29% to hit 118.18.  The yen came under broad selling pressure after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe unveiled a JPY10.3 trillion stimulus package to end deflation and boost growth.  In addition, official data showed that Japan posted a current account deficit of JPY222.4 billion in November, the first deficit in 10 months and far larger than the expected JPY3.5 billion deficit. Later in the day, the U.S. was to release the government’s report on the trade balance."

EUR/USD hit 1.3186 during late Asian trade, the session low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3186, shedding 0.23%. The pair was likely to find support at 1.3163, the low of December 16 and resistance at 1.3256, the high of December 28. Market players remained focused on developments surrounding the fiscal cliff in the U.S., approximately USD600 billion in automatic tax hikes and spending cuts due to come into effect on January 1 unless Democrats and Republicans agree how to cut the deficit.U.S. President Barack Obama met with congressional leaders at the White House Friday afternoon, but both sides failed to reach an agreement ahead of the looming year-end deadline.  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the Senate would resume sitting on Monday to continue discussions, but there were still significant differences between the two sides.Without a deal, the U.S. could fall back into recession and drag much of the world down with it. Elsewhere, the euro was fractionally lower against the pound with EUR/GBP edging down 0.09%, to hit 0.8171. Trading volumes were expected to remain thin as many investors already closed books to lock in profit before the end of the year, reducing liquidity in the market and increasing the volatility."

687,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 18, 2012 09:23PM ET</span>",Forex- Dollar mixed against rivals as cliff talks progress ,"Investing.com- The U.S. dollar was mixed against its major rivals in the early part of Wednesday’s Asian session on hopes U.S. policymakers are inching closer to a solution for the fiscal cliff. The dollar fell during Tuesday’s U.S. session as traders bid up riskier assets and high-yielding currencies as fiscal cliff headlines dominated Tuesday’s newsflow. In Asian trading Wednesday, EUR/USD rose 0.02% to 1.3232. The pair traded as high as 1.3232 and as low as 1.3223. EUR/USD jumped 0.44% to 1.3222 after Standard & Poor's boosted Greece’s sovereign credit rating. Previously rated ""selected default"" by S&P, Greece’s credit rating has been restored to B- with a stable outlook. The ratings agency based its decision on Greece's successful bond buyback. Riskier assets, including high-yielding currencies, oil and stocks also got a lift in the U.S. after the National Association of Home Builders said its NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index of home builder sentiment jumped to 47 this month from a revised 45 last month. Economists expected a December reading of 47. The December reading is the best since April 2006, but readings below 50 indicate a majority of builders hold an unfavorable outlook. While no agreement has been finalized, the Obama Administration and Congressional Republicans continue negotiations about averting the fiscal cliff and that alone seems to be giving traders reason to bid up riskier assets. The sticking points appear to be from where spending cuts will come and the income threshold at which taxes will rise. President Obama has proposed raising taxes on those earning more than $400,000 per year while House Speaker John Boehner has proposed increased taxes for those earning $1 million or more per year.Elsewhere in Asian trading, USD/JPY continued moving higher, gaining 0.13% to 84.32. GBP/USD rose 0.01% to 1.6254. During the European session, the U.K. Office for National Statistics said that the annual rate of consumer price inflation in the U.K. remained unchanged at 2.7% in November after an unexpected increase in October, beating out expectations for a dip to 2.6%. USD/CHF slipped 0.03% 0.9128 while USD/CAD climbed 0.08% to 0.9866. In what represents a departure from recent price action, AUD/USD plunged 0.2% to 1.0514. The pair is still hovering around a year-to-date gain of 6%. NZD/USD slipped 0.32% to 0.8389. The Dollar Index fell modestly, shedding 0.02% to 79.36. During the U.S. session, the Dollar Index fell to its lowest levels in about two months."

The pair was likely to find support at 83.61, the earlier low, and resistance at 84.34, the earlier high. During Monday’s U.S. session, the dollar jumped 0.32% to 83.80, but that was off the session high of 84.34. The dollar and other major currencies spiked against the yen following the results of Sunday’s Japanese elections, which saw Shinzo Abe reclaim the role of Japanese prime minister. Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party also won a landslide majority in Japan’s lower house of parliament, fanning the flames of speculation that Abe will immediately pressure the Bank of Japan to engage in monetary easing to depress the yen. Elsewhere, EUR/JPY surged 0.25% to 110.72 while AUD/JPY continued its ascent, adding 0.22% to 88.63. Japan’s central bank is slated to meet on Wednesday and Thursday with traders widely anticipating an announcement of additional monetary easing. During his campaign, Abe called on the central bank to engage in ""unlimited easing"" in an effort to weaken yen and help Japan’s exporters. With Japanese interest rates at historic lows, BoJ may face a similar situation as the Federal Reserve faces. Rate-cutting is off the table, but asset-buying programs are not. The question is how will traders respond to additional more asset purchasing. The yen was lower against the other majors as well as GBP/JPY added 0.27% to 136.32. CHF/JPY added 0.17 to 91.60 while NZD/JPY continued its impressive run, adding 0.12% to 70.98."

The ECB expects the euro zone economy to return to growth only in 2014, expanding between 0.2% and 2.2%. The central bank also cut the inflation outlook to 2.5% in 2012 and 1.1% to 2.1% in 2013. Final data on Thursday showed that the euro zone economy contracted by 0.1% in the third quarter, unchanged from the preliminary estimate and confirming a recession after a 0.2% contraction in the previous quarter. The ECB left rates unchanged at 0.75% earlier Thursday, in a widely expected decision. Mr. Draghi also said that the implementation of a supervisory mechanism for banks is a ""crucial move towards reintegrating the banking system"".  The euro turned lower against the pound, with EUR/GBP sliding 0.31% to 0.8092 and moved further back from eight-month highs against the yen, with EUR/JPY down 0.36% to 107.36. In the U.S., the Department of Labor said the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance last week fell to 370,000 from 395,000 in the previous week, better than analysts’ forecasts for a decline to 380,000. Jobless claims for the preceding week were revised up to 395,000 from a previously reported 393,000. "

894,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 05, 2012 12:23PM ET</span>","Forex - EUR/USD lower on weak euro zone data, lack luster U.S. numbers","Investing.com - The euro traded down against the U.S. dollar Wednesday as bearish euro zone economic data and a lack luster Spanish bond auction weighed on the single currency, while U.S. data provided a mixed picture.EUR/USD hit 1.3061 during U.S. trade, the session low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3088, shedding 0.05%. The pair was likely to find support at 1.3012 and resistance at 1.3125, the session high and a six-week high. The single currency pulled away from one and a half months highs against the dollar after Spain raised EUR4.3 billion at an auction of government debt, falling short of the target of EUR4.5 billion. Meanwhile, official data showed that retail sales in the euro zone dropped 1.2% in October, compared to expectations for a 0.1% decline.   However,  demand for the single currency continued to be underpinned after Greece launched a scheme to buy back debt from private investors on Monday, as part of an agreement to reduce its debt load and unlock a new bailout package worth EUR44 billion. In the U.S., data showed that ADP nonfarm payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 118,000 in November, below expectations for an increase of 125,000.  The previous month’s figure was revised down to a gain of 157,000 from a previously reported increase of 158,000. A separate report from the Institute of Supply Management showed that service sector activity in the U.S. expanded more rapidly than expected in November. The ISM non-manufacturing purchasing manager's index rose to 54.7 from a reading of 54.2 in October, compared to expectations for a decline to 53.5.  The euro was lower against the pound, with EUR/GBP sliding 0.18% to 0.8117, but held gains against the yen, with EUR/JPY up 0.20% to 107.44. Also Wednesday, the Commerce Department said U.S. factory orders rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.8% in October, compared to expectations for a 0.1% decline "

1001,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 29, 2012 02:52AM ET</span>","Forex - AUD/USD lower, U.S. fiscal hopes support","Investing.com - The Australian dollar was lower against its U.S. counterpart on Thursday, but the Aussie remained supported by hopes fo a deal to avoid a fiscal crisis in the U.S. AUD/USD hit 1.0452 during European morning trade, the daily low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.0455, falling 0.19%. The pair was likely to find support at 1.0410, the low of September 18 and resistance at 1.0518, the high of August 22.  U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, the top Republican in Congress, on Wednesday voiced optimism that Republicans could broker a deal with the White House to avert a fiscal crisis, while President Barack Obama said he hoped to reach an agreement with Congress before Christmas.  Investors fear the planned tax increases and spending cuts, due to start on January 1 and totalling about USD600 billion, could push the world's biggest economy into recession and weigh on the global economic outlook. In Australia, official data earlier showed that private capital expenditure rose by 2.8% in the third quarter, more than the expected 2% rise, following a 3.4% increase in the previous quarter. Separately, the Housing Industry Association said that new home sales in Australia rose by 3.4% in October, after a 3.7% drop the previous month. Elsewhere, the Aussie was lower against the euro with EUR/AUD adding 0.13%, to hit 1.2382. Later in the day, the U.S. was to release preliminary data on third quarter growth as well as the weekly government report on jobless claims."

1006,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 28, 2012 12:10PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD moves lower on Greek fears and fiscal cliff concerns,"Investing.com - The euro slipped lower against the greenback Wednesday, after the release of disappointing U.S. economic data, while worries regarding Greece's new debt target and U.S. fiscal policy decisions continued to weigh. EUR/USD hit 1.2882 during U.S. trade, the pair's lowest since November 23; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.2920, giving back 0.18%.  The U.S. Census Bureau reported new home sales fell by 0.3% to a seasonally adjusted 368,000 units in October, confounding expectations for an increase to 390,000.  New home sales for September were revised down to 369,000 units from a previously reported 389,000.  Meanwhile, investors continued to monitor developments surrounding the looming “fiscal cliff” in the U.S., approximately USD600 billion in automatic tax hikes and spending cuts due to come into effect on January 1.  Sentiment weakened on Tuesday after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he was frustrated by the lack of progress in talks over the U.S. budget impasse in Washington.  The euro also remained under pressure due to the lack of detail on how Greece will implement reforms needed to meet its new debt targets.  Earlier in the week, euro zone finance ministers, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund reached an agreement to reduce Greece’s debt-reduction target by EUR40 billion to 124% of gross domestic product by 2020. Elsewhere, the euro was lower against the pound with EUR/GBP falling 0.10%, to hit 0.8069.  "

1024,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 27, 2012 12:09PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD down as strong U.S. data powers greenback rally,"Investing.com - The euro traded down against the U.S. dollar Tuesday, as bullish U.S. economic data boosted demand for the greenback, while worries over U.S. fiscal policy clouded risk sentiment. EUR/USD hit 1.2923 during U.S. trade, the pair's lowest since November 23; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.2941, slipping 0.24%.  The pair was likely to find support at 1.2869, the low of November 23 and resistance at 1.3009, the session high.  Launching the bullish greenback sentiment, data indicated  U.S. consumer confidence rose to the highest level since February 2008 in November. In a report, the Conference Board said its index of consumer confidence rose to 73.7 in November from a reading of 73.1 in October, whose figure was revised up from 72.2. Analysts had expected the index to decline to 73.0 in November.  The data came after the U.S. Census Bureau said that core durable goods orders, excluding volatile transportation items, rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.5% in October, confounding expectations for a 0.5% decline.  The report also showed that total durable goods orders, which include transportation items, were unchanged last month, compared to expectations for a 0.6% decline.  Separately, Standard & Poor’s with Case-Shiller said its house price index rose at an annualized rate of 3.0% in September from a year earlier, above expectations for a 2.9% increase. The euro strengthened earlier, after euro zone finance ministers, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund reached an agreement to reduce Greece’s debt-reduction target by EUR40 billion to 124% of gross domestic product by 2020. Athens was also cleared to receive a much-needed EUR34.4 billion loan installment in December, easing fears over a messy near-term default and potential exit from the euro zone.  However, sentiment remained under pressure, as investors continued to monitor developments surrounding the looming “fiscal cliff” in the U.S., approximately USD600 billion in automatic tax hikes and spending cuts due to come into effect on January 1.  Elsewhere, the euro was lower against the pound with EUR/GBP dropping 0.33%, to hit 0.8067.  In other news Tuesday, Spain’s Treasury sold EUR1.48 billion worth of three-month government bonds at an average yield of 1.254% earlier in the day, down from 1.415% at a similar auction last month. "

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she believes a deal can be reached at Monday’s talks, while the French finance minister said over the weekend that an agreement is close.  Investors were also cautious after separatist parties in Spain’s Catalonia region won the majority of the public vote in elections held over the weekend.  The win underlined fears about a potential negative impact on the euro zone’s fourth largest economy, as Catalonia accounts for nearly 20% of economic activity and provides the most tax revenue to the central government.  Elsewhere, the euro was fractionally higher against the pound withEUR/GBP inching up 0.09%, to hit 0.8099.  Earlier in the day, research group Gfk said that its index of Germany’s consumer climate fell to 5.9 in November from a reading of 6.1 the previous month, whose figure was revised down from 6.3.

EUR/USD hit 1.2969 during U.S. morning trade, the pair's highest since November 1; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.2956, climbing 0.57%. The pair was likely to find support at 1.2869, the session low and resistance at 1.2983, the high of October 30.  The euro gained ground after Greece said the International Monetary Fund had relaxed its debt-cutting target for the country, suggesting lenders were closer to a deal for a vital aid tranche to be paid. However, other sources involved in the talks cautioned that the funding gap was far bigger than Greece has suggested. Talks between finance ministers and the International Monetary Fund ended without a deal on Tuesday, amid disagreements on how best to reduce the country’s debt to sustainable levels.  Investor confidence also strengthened after the German Institute for Economic Research earlier said that its index of business confidence improved to 101.4 in November from a reading of 100.0 the previous month, beating expectations for a decline to 99.5.  Elsewhere, the euro was steady against the pound with EUR/GBP inching up 0.01%, to hit 0.8084.  Trade volumes were expected to remain light, with U.S. markets closing early for Thanksgiving weekend."

The pair was likely to find support at 1.2689, Friday’s low and resistance at 1.2875, the high of November 7. Traders were looking ahead of a meeting of the eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers on Tuesday to discuss whether Greece will receive its next tranche of financial aid.  A decision on unlocking Greece’s next bailout installment has been delayed by disagreements between officials from the International Monetary Fund and Europe on how best to reduce the country’s debt to manageable levels.  Concerns over the economic outlook for the euro zone persisted after Germany's central bank warned earlier that economic growth in the bloc’s largest economy is weakening as a result of the crisis in the region, as well as problems in the global economy. Meanwhile, market sentiment was boosted after U.S. Congressional leaders said talks with President Barack Obama on Friday to avert the fiscal cliff, a combination of automatic tax increases and spending cuts due to come into effect from January, were ""constructive.""  The euro was higher against the pound and the yen, with EUR/GBP up 0.36% to 0.8052 and EUR/JPY rising 0.43% to 104.05. In other news  Monday, the National Association of Realtors said that U.S. existing home sales rose by 2.1% to a seasonally adjusted 4.79 million units in October from September’s revised total of 4.69 million.  September existing home sales were initially reported at 4.75 million units. Analysts had expected U.S. existing home sales to rise to 4.75 million units in October. "

The euro extended losses against the dollar after official data showed tht U.S. industrial production fell unexpectedly in October, ticking down 0.4% after a 0.2% rise the previous month.

A separate report showed that the U.S. capacity utilization rate declined to 77.8% in October from 78.2% the previous month, disappointing expectations for an increase to 78.3%.

The pair was likely to find support at 80.12, the session low and resistance at 81.69, the high of. April 24. The safe haven greenback gained ground after official data showed that the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week surged to the highest level since April 2011. The U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending November 10 rose by 78,000 to a seasonally adjusted 439,000, compared to expectations for an increase of 14,000 to 375,000. In addition, data showed that consumer price inflation in the U.S. rose in line with expectations in October, while prices excluding food and energy costs increased more-than-expected.A separate report showed that the New York Federal Reserve’s index of manufacturing conditions improved unexpectedly in November, but remained in contraction territory for the fourth consecutive month. Meanwhile, the yen remained under pressure after Shinzo Abe, the head of Japan's main opposition party and frontrunner in next month's election, called for aggressive monetary easing by the BoJ to support growth. Abe said he wants the central bank to set interest rates at zero or below zero to enhance lending and added that he wants to work with the BOJ to reverse the trend of a stronger yen, as it hurts the competitiveness of small firms. The comments came after Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Wednesday he could dissolve the lower house of the parliament on November 16, suggesting that an election will be held next month. The yen was also sharply lower against the euro with EUR/JPY jumping 1.56%, to hit 103.79. Also Thursday, official data released showed that the euro zone's economy shrank 0.1% in the third quarter, following a contraction of 0.2% in the preceding quarter. A technical recession is defined as two straight quarters of contraction.Later in the day, the U.S. was to release a report on manufacturing activity in Philadelphia, while a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke was to be closely watched for any indications on the future possible direction of monetary policy."

USD/JPY hit 80.95 during European morning trade, the pair's highest since April 27; the pair subsequently consolidated at 80.79, climbing 0.68%. The pair was likely to find support at 80.12, the session low and resistance at 80.95, the session high. The yen came under pressure after Shinzo Abe, the head of Japan's main opposition party and frontrunner in next month's election, called for aggressive monetary easing by the BoJ to support growth. Abe said he wants the central bank to set interest rates at zero or below zero to enhance lending and added that he wants to work with the BOJ to reverse the trend of a stronger yen, as it hurts the competitiveness of small firms.  The comments came after Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Wednesday he could dissolve the lower house of the parliament on November 16, suggesting that an election will be held next month.

The euro hit session highs against the greenback earlier after Italy saw borrowing costs fall to the lowest level since October 2010 at an auction of three-year government bonds. However, concerns that the economic outlook for the euro zone is worsening were underlined after official data showed that industrial production in the bloc tumbled 2.5% in September, compared to expectations for a 1.9% decline.  In the U.S., official data showed that retail sales fell by 0.3% in October, disappointing expectations for a 0.2% decline, while core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, were flat last month.  A separate report showed that producer price inflation in the U.S. fell unexpectedly in October, while core prices also dipped.

The European Commission slashed its forecast for growth in the euro zone earlier, saying it now expects gross domestic product to contract by 0.4% this year, expand by just 0.1% in 2013 before growing 1.4% in 2014. The report came after official data showed that German industrial production dropped 1.8% in September, compared to expectations for a 0.5% decline, adding to concerns that the bloc’s economy is weakening. Elsewhere, official data showed that industrial production in Spain tumbled 7% in September, almost double the decline expected by economists. Another report showed that retail sales on the euro zone fell by 0.2% in September, compared to expectations for a 0.1% decline.   The euro also came under broad selling pressure ahead of a Greek parliamentary vote later in the day, on an austerity bill necessary for Athens to secure its next installment of bailout funds. The shared currency advanced to session highs against the dollar earlier in the session, as President Barack Obama’s re-election for a second term was seen as boosting the chances that the Federal Reserve’s policy of quantitative easing will remain in place. The euro fell to a five-week low against the pound, with EUR/GBPdown 0.32% to 0.7985 and hit a one-month low against the yen, withEUR/JPY dropping 0.98% to 101.94. Also Wednesday, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi warned that the economic situation in the euro zone is currently weak. "

The pair was likely to find near-term support at 1.2753, the low of September 11 and resistance at 1.2841, the session high. Demand for the greenback improved as investors focused on the outcome of Tuesday’s U.S. elections, with opinion polls pointing to a close race between incumbent President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney. The single currency remained under selling pressure amid concerns over whether Greece’s parliament would approve a package of spending cuts and tax hikes in a vote on Wednesday, which will determine if Athens receives its next tranche of financial aid. The U.S. dollar remained supported after official data on Friday showed that the U.S. economy added 171,000 jobs in October, beating forecasts for an increase of 125,000 and boosting the U.S. economic outlook. The euro was hovering close to a five-week low against the pound, with EUR/GBP dipping 0.06% to 0.8006 and was lower against the yen, with EUR/JPY falling 0.64% to 102.62. The dollar was did not react after a report showed that the rate of growth in the U.S. service sector slowed in October as new orders declined. The Institute of Supply Management said its non-manufacturing purchasing manager's index fell to 54.2 from a reading of 55.1 in September.   Analysts had expected the index to decline to 54.5 in October. "

The pair was likely to find support at 1.2885, Tuesday’s low and resistance at 1.3019, Wednesday’s high. The euro came off session lows after the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits fell to 363,000 last week from 372,000 the previous week, compared to expectations for a decline to 370,000. The previous week’s figure was revised up to 372,000 from a previously reported 369,000. The data came on the heels of a report showing that U.S. private sector employment increased more-than-expected in October. Payroll processing firm ADP said the U.S. private sector added 158,000 jobs this month, surpassing expectations for an increase of 135,000.  The previous month’s figure was revised down to a gain of 88,200 from a previously reported increase of 162,000. Also Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of U.S. purchasing managers rose to a five-month high of 51.7 in October from a reading of 51.5 in September.  A separate report showed that U.S. consumer confidence rose to the highest level since February 2008 in October. The euro’s gains were limited amid ongoing uncertainty over when Spain may request a bailout and whether Greece will secure the next tranche of its bailout funding. Investors also remained cautious ahead of U.S. data on nonfarm payrolls on Friday and the U.S. presidential elections next week. The euro was lower against the pound, with EUR/GBP falling 0.19% to 0.8020 but was higher against the yen, with EUR/JPY rising 0.30% to 103.68. Earlier Thursday, data showed that the U.K. manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 47.5 in October from a reading of 48.4 in September, compared to expectations for a dip to 48.1. Demand for the pound continued to remain underpinned after government data last week showed that the U.K. economy emerged from recession in the third quarter, prompting market participants to trim back expectations for another round of easing by the Bank of England. "

The pair was likely to find support at 1.2885, Tuesday’s low and resistance at 1.3019, the session high. Kingsbury International said its Chicago purchasing managers’ index rose to 49.9 in October from a reading of 49.7 the previous month. Analysts had expected the index to improve to 50.0 in October. Overall market sentiment remained supported by gains in equities as U.S. markets reopened following a two-day closure for Hurricane Sandy. Earlier Wednesday, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said his country needs the help of the European Union to meet its budget goals, before adding that EU progress on a banking union would allow leeway on making a formal request for aid. Speaking in the Spanish Parliament, Mr. Rajoy also said that an agreement on direct bank recapitalization is getting closer and that such an agreement would improve market confidence. Elsewhere, official data showed that the unemployment rate in the euro zone climbed to a record 11.6% in September, from an upwardly revised 11.5% in August, adding to concerns over the deepening impact of the region’s debt crisis. Earlier Wednesday, official data showed that German retail sales rose 1.5% in September, the fastest pace since June 2011, easily beating expectations for a 0.3% increase. The euro was down against the pound, with EUR/GBP dipping 0.22% to 0.8045, but remained higher against the yen, with EUR/JPYup 0.37% to 103.57. In other news Wednesday, the euro group of euro zone finance ministers held discussions on Greece’s progress towards meeting austerity targets.  Following the talks, the ministers urged Greek authorities ""to solve remaining issues” and said they would hold further discussions on November 12 after they have received the troika’s report on Greece. "

But investors remained cautious amid concerns over Greece's financial troubles, after a report from the International Monetary Fund said Greek debt would be above the target agreed with international lenders.

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was down against the euro, with EUR/USD rising 0.28% to 1.3058. The euro steadied after the center-right Popular Party of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy increased its majority in his home region of Galicia on Sunday, removing a possible obstacle to formally requesting a bailout from Spain’s euro zone partners. The greenback rose to a more than three-month high against the yen, with USD/JPY up 0.63% to 79.81.

The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, slipped 0.13% to 79.62.

The pair was likely to find support at 1.3012, Friday’s low and resistance at 1.3127, Thursday’s high. Risk sentiment found support after Spanish regional election results indicated support for the austerity policies of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. The center-right Popular Party of Prime Minister Rajoy increased its majority in his home region of Galicia on Sunday, removing a possible obstacle to formally requesting a bailout from Spain’s euro zone partners. A bailout request by Spain would activate the European Central Bank’s bond purchasing scheme, aimed at lowering high peripheral bond yields in the euro zone. Prime Minister Rajoy said Friday he still had not decided whether to request a sovereign bailout.  The euro was trading close to a four-month high against the pound, withEUR/GBP up 0.18% to 0.8151 and the single currency climbed to five-and-a-half month high against the broadly weaker yen, with EUR/JPY rising 1.02% to 104.33.

During European early afternoon trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD shedding 0.20% to 1.3041. Expectations that Spain will ask for a sovereign bailout has underpinned demand for the euro over recent days, but uncertainty about when such a request might come has made investors wary of driving the single currency much higher. Meeting on Thursday in Brussels, European leaders made some progress towards establishing a single banking supervisor for the currency bloc, but, as expected, talked little about immediate plans for debt-ridden problem members, Spain and Greece. Also Friday, official data showed that producer price inflation in Germany rose in line with expectations in September, ticking up 0.03% after a 0.05% rise the previous month. The greenback was steady against the pound, with GBP/USD inching up 0.01% to 1.6046. Official data earlier showed that public sector net borrowing in the U.K. fell unexpectedly in September, declining to GBP10.7 billion from GBP10.8 billion the previous month. Analysts had expected public sector net borrowing to rise to GBP11.4 billion in September. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the yen, with USD/JPY slipping 0.12% lower to hit 79.17, but higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF rising 0.23% to trade at 0.9268.  Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa warned on Friday that slowing overseas growth is weighing on business sentiment and may hurt capital spending, signalling readiness to expand monetary stimulus further to support a fragile economy. In addition, the greenback was mixed to higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD adding 0.23% to 0.9875, AUD/USD easing 0.08% to 1.0359 and NZD/USD inching up 0.09% to hit 0.8191.

The pair was likely to find support at 1.2942, Tuesday’s low and near-term resistance at 1.3138, Wednesday’s high and a one-month high. The single currency sentiment was hit after the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits last week rose by 46,000 to a seasonally adjusted 388,000, compared to expectations for an increase to 365,000. The previous week’s figure was revised up to 342,000 from a previously reported 339,000, which was the lowest reading since February 2008. A separate report showed that manufacturing activity in Philadelphia expanded for the first time in six months in October. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its manufacturing index improved to 5.7 from minus 1.9 in September and better than expectations for a reading of 1.0. The euro remained supported after Spain saw the yield on 10-year government bonds fall to the lowest level since April at an auction of government debt earlier in the session. Spain’s Treasury sold EUR1.51 billion worth of ten-year government bonds at an average yield of 5.45%, down from 5.66% at a similar auction last month. The yield on three-year bonds fell to 3.22% from 3.95% last month, while the yield on four-year bonds declined to 3.97% from 4.60% in September. Investors remained cautious as European Union leaders gathered for a two-day summit in Brussels, although no major announcements on Spain or Greece were expected. The euro slipped lower against the pound, with EUR/GBP losing 0.03% 0.8122, but held gains against the yen, with EUR/JPY up 0.34% to 103.92.

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was close to a one-month low against the euro, with EUR/USD up 0.52% to 1.3122. The euro strengthened broadly after Spain avoided a downgrade to junk status by ratings agency Moody’s late Tuesday. Following the announcement, the yield on Spanish 10-year government bonds dropped to multi-month lows of 5.46%. Sentiment on the euro has been underpinned in recent weeks by hopes that Spain will soon request a bailout from its euro zone partners, but uncertainty over the timing of a request and what form a bailout would take has persisted. A spokesperson for Spain’s prime minister said earlier that Spain’s stance on a bailout had not changed and the government had not yet made a decision on requesting aid. Elsewhere, the Commerce Department said U.S. housing starts rose by 15% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 872,000 units, the fastest rate since July 2008 and easily outstripping expectations for a 2.7% increase. Housing starts for August were revised up to 758,000 million units from a previously reported 750,000 million units. Building permits grew by 11.6% to a 894,000-unit pace in September, while August's permits were unrevised at 801,000 units. The greenback was lower against the pound, with GBP/USD rising 0.25% to 1.6152. In the U.K., official data showed that the number of people claiming jobless benefit fell by 4,000 last month, compared to expectations for a decline of 1,000, bringing the unemployment rate down to 7.9% from 8.1% in August.  Separately, the minutes of the Bank of England’s October meeting showed that policymakers voted in favor of leaving the size of the bank’s asset purchase program unchanged at GBP375 billion and interest rates at a record low 0.5% this month. However, the minutes indicated that policymakers disagreed over whether more easing will be required when the current round of asset purchases ends later this month. Elsewhere, the greenback turned higher against the yen but lower against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY up 0.08% to 78.97 and USD/CHF down 0.45% to 0.9217.  The greenback was down sharply against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD falling 0.71% to 0.9796, AUD/USDrallying 0.99% to 1.0377 and NZD/USD jumping 0.92% to 0.8215. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.53% to 78.99. Also Wednesday, Germany lowered its forecast for economic growth in 2013 to 1% from 1.6% previously. Economy Minister Philipp Rosler said “Germany is navigating stormy waters because of the European sovereign debt crisis and an economic weakening in emerging nations in Asia and Latin America”. "

The pair was likely to find support at 1.2942, the session low and resistance at 1.3120, the high of September 18. Michael Meister, a deputy caucus leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Party denied referring to Spain in his comments, which he said were “over-interpreted”. The euro rallied earlier in the session, following media reports that Meister and another senior German lawmaker backed a Spanish application for a precautionary credit line from the European Stability Mechanism, the euro zone’s permanent bailout fund. On Monday, Spanish government officials said they were exploring the option of requesting a credit line from the ESM, in order to satisfy the terms of the European Central Bank’s bond buying program, but then not using it, instead waiting for borrowing costs to fall. Elsewhere in the euro zone, talks between the Greek government and the troika broke down in Athens, as the country struggles to meet deficit reduction targets demanded by international creditors. The euro remained supported after the ZEW index of German economic sentiment improved to minus 11.5 in October from September’s reading of minus 18.2. Economists had forecast a reading of minus 15.0 this month. Separately, official data showed that consumer price inflation in the euro zone slowed to 2.6% in September, down from a preliminary estimate of 2.7%. In the U.S., the Labor Department said consumer prices rose by 0.6% in September, above expectations for a 0.5% gain on the back of higher gasoline prices. The euro was close to one-month highs against the pound and the yen, with EUR/GBP up 0.50% to 0.8098 and EUR/JPY rallying 1.05% to 102.89. In other news Tuesday, official data showed that industrial production in the U.S. rose 0.4% in September, above expectations for a 0.2% increase, after dropping by an upwardly revised 1.4% in August. "
