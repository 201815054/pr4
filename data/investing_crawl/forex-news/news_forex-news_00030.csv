(Updates with European opening)
 By Ian Chua
 SYDNEY, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Investors gave stocks a wide
berth on Wednesday on renewed worries China may hike interest
rates this week and after top level meetings in Europe failed
to produce a clear solution to tackle Ireland's debt crisis.
 Dublin has so far resisted pressure to request aid,
although euro zone ministers have agreed to send a joint
European-IMF mission to Ireland that could prepare the way for
a bailout to prevent its debt crisis spreading to other
countries.
 Asian stocks excluding Japan dropped to their lowest level
in four weeks, while European bourses opened lower with the
FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares down 0.2 percent.
 The rally in the dollar, meanwhile, briefly paused after
two top Federal Reserve officials were reported by the Wall
Street Journal as saying the central bank may need to go beyond
its latest plan to pump $600 billion into the U.S. economy.
 The MSCI Asia stock index excluding Japan fell 1.5 percent
to its lowest level since Oct. 20, on track to close lower for
an eighth straight session.
 Among the worst performers, Australian shares slid 1.6
percent as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto both suffered falls of
more than 2 percent.
 Investors worry that China, Australia's largest export
market, is preparing more aggressive steps to tame inflation
and thus risk slower growth.
 CHINA INFLATION
 Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said his government was
preparing steps to tame price rises, feeding into market
expectations that China will intensify tightening policies.
There is talk that it may do so as soon as Friday.
 ""China wants to send a message to everybody that this time
they are serious in fighting inflation, reducing excess
liquidity and controlling speculative inflows,"" said Danny Yan,
who helps manage more than $400 million at Tai Fook Asset
Management.
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng index shed 2.2 percent, while Chinese
shares fell 1.9 percent. Several other markets in Asia were
closed for holidays, including Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia
and India.
 Japan's Nikkei average, however, eked out a small gain as
shares in some exporters, such as car makers, benefited from
the yen's softness against the dollar.
 The dollar hit a six-week high of 83.59 yen in New York,
and was last at 83.44, while the euro, which fell as low as
$1.3446 overnight, edged up to $1.3500.
 Worries about further policy moves in China also knocked
commodity prices lower. Shanghai copper and zinc futures fell
by their daily limit, chasing losses of 5 to 8.5 percent in
London in the previous session.
 ""We know it's coming, but we don't know when. The
uncertainty is a risk-appetite killer, but like Rumsfeld once
said, 'it's a known unknown',"" a trader in Hong Kong said,
referring to comments by former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld.
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange fell 1.1
percent to $8,060 a tonne, down about 10 percent from a record
high of $8,966 set on Nov. 11.
 Spot gold was a touch lower on the day at $1,335.00 an
ounce, having shed 2 percent the previous day to a two-week
low, while crude oil slipped 0.5 percent to $81.95 a barrel,
still shaky after Tuesday's 3 percent fall.
 U.S. Treasuries held on to most of the gains made on
Tuesday, with the 10-year note yield flat at 2.84 percent, off
a 3-1/2-month high near 3 percent set on Monday.

3,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2010 02:04AM ET</span>",Sustainable product markets growing rapidly -report," * Growth in sustainable products outpaces conventional goods
 * Sustainable coffee now 8 pct of global exports
 GENEVA, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Markets for sustainable products,
such as those with the Fairtrade label, have expanded rapidly
over the past five years and are growing much faster than those
for conventional goods, a U.N.-backed report said on Wednesday.
 The report measures the success of initiatives aimed at
providing markets in rich countries -- often commanding premium
prices -- for producers in developing states who adopt
environmentally sound cultivation methods or progressive social
and labour methods that promote development.
 The State of Sustainability Initiatives Review, produced by
non-governmental organisations and the United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development, looks at projects attaching
environmental and social standards to commodities in the
forestry, coffee, cocoa, tea and banana sectors.
 Its findings include:
 * Land under globally recognised sustainable forestry
certification has nearly tripled to 343.60 million hectares in
2009 -- nearly 9 percent of global forested land -- from 122.27
million in 2004;
 * Sales of certified sustainable coffee more than quintupled
in the period to 392,347 tonnes in 2009 -- representing more
than 8 percent of global coffee exports and 17 percent of global
production -- from 73,602 tonnes in 2004;
 * Sustainable cocoa sales more than tripled to 46,896 tonnes
in 2008 (2008) -- 1.2 percent of global sales -- from 13,473
tonnes in 2003 (2003);
 * Sustainable tea production has grown more than 50 times to
281,105 tonnes in 2009 -- 7.7 percent of global exports -- from
less than 5,000 tonnes in 2004;
 * Sustainable banana sales rose to 3.48 million tonnes in
2009 -- 20 percent of global exports -- from 2.13 million in
2004.
 The review says that environmental criteria are the most
noticeable features of the voluntary initiatives, covering
topics such as greenhouse gas emissions, energy conservation and
banning genetically modified organisms.
 Social requirements focus on compliance with international
labour standards, worker health and safety and employment
conditions, with less emphasis on gender, employment benefits,
community involvement and humane treatment of animals, it said.
 The initiatives are bringing greater transparency to global
supply chains, but the review recognises that the initiatives
themselves are coming under greater pressure to provide
transparency and disclosure about their own workings, as they
become more important economically.
 The report notes that initiatives are opening up
decision-making in supply chains to developing country
stakeholders, who have significant representation at board
level, although control in almost all cases rests with developed
countries.

 MONTGOMERY, Ala., Nov 16 (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve
officials on Tuesday fought back against a stream of criticism
over its $600 billion economic stimulus, arguing it was
necessary to shore up the fragile recovery.	
 The Fed's effort to pump money into the financial system
by buying up Treasury bonds has sparked fears it will feed
asset bubbles in emerging markets and generate domestic
inflation.	
 Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart took issue
with the idea pressed repeatedly by top economic officials in
countries like China and Brazil that the easing was a backdoor
effort to jumpstart exports through a weaker dollar.
[ID:nN16158646]	
 ""There is no monetary policy intent to engineer specific
values -- or even a direction-- for the dollar,"" Lockhart said
in a speech before the Alabama World Affairs Council. ""This
policy was not undertaken to prompt dollar depreciation.""	
 Others struck a similar chord.	
 In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Charles
Evans of the Chicago Fed said the central bank's primary
concern must, by definition, the performance of the American
economy.	
 
 After emerging last summer from its deepest recession
since the Great Depression, the U.S. economy has grown
unevenly. It registered a modest 2 percent annualized rate of
growth in the third quarter.	
 Unemployment remains stuck at 9.6 percent and inflation is
running at below the levels preferred by Fed policymakers.	
 ""I would continue to want to apply accommodative monetary
policy until I had some confidence that that situation was
changing,"" Mr. Evans was quoted as saying in the Journal
interview. He said $600 billion is a ""good place to start"" the
easing program.	
 U.S. producer prices excluding food and energy
unexpectedly fell in October to post their largest decline in
more than four years. 
 ""It suggests that the Federal Reserve's fight ... may be
tougher than we might have thought,"" said Hugh Johnson, chief
investment officer at Hugh Johnson Advisors in Albany, New York.	
 
 WHOLE HOG 
 Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren , who, like
Evans, is considered one of the more dovish members of the
Federal Open Market Committee that sets official U.S. interest
rates, was even willing to consider additional purchases.	
 ""As long as the economic outlook doesn't improve
dramatically I would expect that we will purchase the entire
amount,"" he told the Wall Street Journal. ""If the economy were
to weaken and we were to get further disinflation and a higher
unemployment rate, then we would have to reflect on whether we
should take additional action.""	
 Lockhart, the Atlanta Fed President, also indicated he
expected the full $600 billion program to be completed through
its June deadline. 
 His St. Louis counterpart, James Bullard, suggested it
would take a perceptible turnaround in the economy's prospects
for officials to stop short.	
 ""The economy would have to improve a fair amount before
the whole committee would pull back on that,"" Bullard told
Bloomberg Radio.	
 Reuters reported on Friday that the Fed was unlikely to
trim the bond purchase plan, barring a sharp shift in the U.S.
economic outlook. [ID:nN12161864] 
 During the financial crisis of 2007-2009, the Fed lowered
official rates effectively to zero and bought some $1.7
trillion in Treasury and mortgage-linked securities.	
 
 MANDATE QUESTIONED	
 The array of official commentary comes as domestic
opposition to the Fed's asset-purchase program, mostly from
Republican lawmakers and right-leaning economists, reached a
crescendo. [ID:nN12188104] 
 On Tuesday, two prominent U.S. Republican lawmakers said
the Fed should focus solely on inflation and ditch its ""dual
mandate"" to promote both price stability and full employment.
[ID:nN16134115]	
 Asked about the proposal, Lockhart said it was too early
to comment. Rosengren was more forceful, maintaining that the
two goals were wholly compatible given that both inflation and
employment are below desired levels.	
 A U.S. Senate committee on Tuesday approved the nomination
of Nobel laureate Peter Diamond to the Fed's Board over
Republican objections, sending it to the full Senate for a
vote three months after it was blocked. [ID:nN16125928]	
 The Fed expects its unconventional monetary accommodation
to boost spending by consumers and businesses by driving up
prices in asset markets, making it easier for companies to
fund new investments and helping households to repair their
battered balance sheets.	
 Lockhart argued the policy was already showing signs of
working by boosting market-based expectations of inflation,
thereby lessening a risk of deflation that looked all too real
just a couple of months back.	
 William Dudley, head of the New York Fed ,
emphasized the modest, incremental nature of the policy's
likely effects, saying it could take a long time before
economic conditions warrant an unwinding of the ultra-easy
policy stance. 
 ""This exit could be years away,"" he said an interview on
CNBC.	
 The Fed's latest round of monetary accommodation, also
known as quantitative easing, faces some internal opposition
as well. Fed Board Governor Kevin Warsh argued last
week he did not believe the policy would yield significant
benefits.	
 Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker said on
Sunday he thought the program's risks outweighed its benefits.

 * Hamilton Sundstrand chief says not interested in Zodiac
 * Safran shares fall, Zodiac rises
(Adds analyst comment, no comment from Zodiac)
 By Tim Hepher and Alison Leung
 ZHUHAI, China, Nov 17 (Reuters) - France's Safran is not
ruling out a hostile bid for aerospace supplier Zodiac after a
fruitless attempt to start friendly merger talks, Chief
Executive Jean-Paul Herteman said.
 ""It is not our style but indeed, theoretically, it is one of
the possible options, but it needs reflection,"" Herteman said in
an interview, when asked whether a hostile offer was one of the
options being considered.
 Safran plans to make a decision ""in a short time,"" he told a
small group of journalists in a joint interview at the Zhuhai
airshow.
 Shares of Zodiac Aerospace rose as much as 3.2 percent after
the comments, while Safran's stock lost 4.2 percent to hit a
near one-month low.
 At 1332 GMT Safran shares had pared their losses to a drop
of 1.7 percent, at 21.465 euros. Zodiac was up 1.8 percent, at
52.58 euros.
 A spokesman for Zodiac in Paris declined to comment.
 Another potential suitor recently mentioned in French media,
U.S. electronics firm Hamilton Sundstrand, part of United
Technologies Corp, ruled itself out of any contest to buy
Zodiac.
 ""This is speculation. We are not at all looking at this ...
pure speculation,"" Hamilton Sundstrand President Alain Bellemare
told Reuters while also attending China's largest air show.
 Safran made an informal approach by letter in July to
Zodiac, which went public with its rejection of merger talks.
Relations between Zodiac and state-controlled Safran remain
frosty.
 
 ""SMART CABIN"" OPPORTUNITIES
 Zodiac, which has a market value of almost 3 billion euros,
makes electronic aircraft systems which Herteman believes will
become an increasingly important part of aircraft design.
 ""The chain of electrical systems in airplanes is expanding
and all the experts say that one day all an aircraft's actuation
systems will be electrical instead of hydraulic.""
 Analysts have however criticised the Safran manoeuvre,
saying there are few obvious synergies between the two French
companies. Safran makes aircraft engines and Zodiac is best
known for cabin seats and interiors after it sold its famous
inflatable boats business.
 Paris brokerage Chevreux criticised Safran's continued
interest in Zodiac, saying Safran shareholders would have to pay
a high price of at least 70 euros a share to get control of
Zodiac.
 ""We are still sceptical on the interest of such a deal,"" it
said in a note on Hertemann's comments in China.
 But Herteman said cabins were more sophisticated than they
appeared and a large company such as Safran could make a
difference in a market fragmented between relatively small
suppliers.
 ""We are going towards smart cabins where cabling and cabin
fitting have more in common,"" he said.
 Hostile bids are rare in France but Herteman, a soft-spoken
engineer with a reputation for tenacity, is seen as eager to
maintain pressure on the smaller company.
 Industry analysts say a Safran-Zodiac combination would
compete directly with U.S. supplier Hamilton Sundstrand and to a
lesser extent with Honeywell, also of the United States.
 Safran recently agreed to acquire US face-recognition
software company L1 and a part of French state chemicals firm
SNPE.

Asia, highlighting risks in equity valuations, the pricing of
new issues, leveraged financing and even fine wine to gauge how
frothy markets are getting.
 By Prakash Chakravarti and David Lau
 HONG KONG, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Asia's booming credit markets
are not yet bubbling over, with investors drawing a line at
exotic perpetual bonds, though some equity valuations in
red-hot Southeast Asian bourses appear stretched.
 Asia ex-Japan, with its favourable economic fundamentals
and stable balance sheets, has been a magnet for foreign
capital, one whose attraction have been made all the more
powerful by expectations that money will stay cheap in advanced
economies for a long time.
 A growing number of emerging economies in Asia and
elsewhere in the world have been imposing or considering
capital controls to keep the influx of speculative money from
feeding potentially destabilising bubbles and complicating
policymaking even further.
 Visiting bankers from the West have been struck by the
boldness of Asia's nouveau riche, who last month bought three
bottles of 141-year-old Chateau Lafite Rothschild wine at
Sotheby's in Hong Kong for $232,692 each, nearly triple the
highest estimate.
 It's no surprise then that some analysts say if any asset
bubbles form in Asia, it would be among the most anticipated in
modern history. Indeed, the phrase ""asset bubble"" has appeared
in more than 3,000 articles so far in 2010, more than any other
year in the past decade, Factiva showed.
 Below are highlights of the bubble risks traders and
investors face in Asia. For now the risks appear relatively
low.
 BONDS
 Bubble risks: Low. Borrowers want to lock in long-term
funding, but investors are asking for higher premiums.
 * ""Risk on"" trading in the wake of the Federal Reserve's
second round of quantitive easing has given way to profit
taking in secondary markets as U.S. Treasury yields spike.
* The issuance calendar is still full but upward pressure on
yields and unfriendliness toward structures that push
boundaries, such as perpetual bonds, may eventually cool
primary markets.
* Perpetuals, which have no maturity and had not been issued
by an Asian corporate in 13 years, issued by Cheung Kong
Infrastructure, Hutchison Whampoa and Noble Group fared poorly
in secondary trading after Noble's bond attempted to push
through with what was viewed as an aggressive structure.
 * Noble's 3-point drop in secondary trading was a reality
check for bankers and a curb on bubble behaviour. Likewise,
OCBC Bank's Lower Tier 2 bond with a 12-year non-call seven
maturity - the first of its kind from an Asian bank - widened
as much as 20 basis points two days after it was issued.
 * Asia ex-Japan G3 currency bond issuance hit a record
US$78 billion so far this year, with nearly six more weeks to
go in 2010, Thomson Reuters data showed.
 For a chart of G3 bond issuance in Asia, click
 http://r.reuters.com/tuv22q
 * Rare borrowers are still coming out of the woodwork to
lock in long tenors at tight prices. They include Sri Lanka's
$1 billion 10-year bond and a $1 billion 10-year global bond
from India's biggest bank ICICI Bank. Both borrowers were able
to achieve tighter pricing on the latest bonds than that paid
on their last borrowings, which were shorter in duration.
 * Investors still are welcoming higher duration in both
high-yield and high-grade names, for now. Watch how far down
they go on the credit scale.
 * Capital curbs have already cooled foreign inflows in some
of Southeast Asia's hot bond markets.
 While Indonesia has been hit by duration-cutting trades
after posting equity-like returns for the second consecutive
year, Thai bond yields have rocketed after Bangkok reimposed a
15 percent withholding tax for offshore purchases of local
bonds on Oct 13. In Philippines, a dollar shortage engineered
by the central bank dimmed the relative allure of Philippine
assets and weakened the peso sharply -- one of the top
performing Asian currencies so far this year.
 EQUITIES
 Bubble risks: Low to medium, on Southeast Asia valuations,
IPO frenzy
 * Asia's hottest stock markets this year in the Southeast
may be due for a correction. Without one, they run the risk of
forming a bubble.
 * MSCI indexes for Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand
are trading at price-to-12-month forward earnings ratios that
are 22 percent above the five-year average, Thomson Reuters
I/B/E/S data show.
 * Valuations may contract, with the 30-day mean change in
12-month earnings estimates for the Philippines and Indonesia
down 0.1 percent, according to Starmine data.
 * A gaggle of prominent shareholders liquidated nearly $2
billion worth of equities in Hong Kong, South Korea, Indonesia
and Malaysia last week, signalling a possible top of the market
because of high valuations.
 * Contrast that with Coal India's  IPO on Nov. 4,
which encapsulated the frenetic year for IPOs. The $3.5 billion
offering drew $52 billion in orders, and shares surged 40
percent on the first day of trade.
 * ""When everyone at large starts talking optimism, that is
the time to get cautious. Retail participation has increased a
lot. There are plenty of 'tips' floating around. All these are
danger signs."" said Arun Kejriwal, director of research firm
KRIS in Mumbai.
 OFFSHORE LOANS
 Bubble risks: Low since leveraged deal volume is way below
2007.
 * Asian borrowers are being aggressive but lenders are not
giving in so easily yet, reducing the risks of overleverage.
 * A Lacklustre response last month to Bharti Airtel's $7.5
billion offshore loan in syndication to finance the purchase of
assets from Zain Group shows banks are being sensible about
pricing and risk.
 * Average pricing for offshore loans in Asia in 2010 has
dropped considerably from 2009 though still has not reached
lows from the 2003-2007 boom years, Thomson Reuters LPC data
show.
 For a chart of average Asian syndicated loan pricing, click
 [http://link.reuters.com/juf65q]
 * Leveraged buyout financing in Asia Pacific ex Japan is as
of the third quarter $2.03 billion. Last year LBO volume was
$2.52 billion, still way below the last bull market high of
$21.32 billion in 2007.
 * Kohlberg Kravis Roberts' $1.7 billion LBO of Australian
fund manager Perpetual may be the weather vane for leveraged
finance. Expect LBO financing to heat up if the deal is
successful.

 * Market eyes developments in Irish debt crisis
 * Fed comments marginally hurt greenback
 * Aussie dlr below $0.9800, lowest since late Oct
 By Ian Chua and Hideyuki Sano
 SYDNEY/TOKYO, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near
seven-week lows versus the dollar on Wednesday, threatening to
deepen a 5 percent slide seen so far this month with no immediate
solution for Ireland's debt crisis in sight.
 While euro zone finance ministers agreed to lay the
groundwork for bailing out Ireland's banking sector with the IMF,
Dublin has yet to decide whether to request the aid.
 The uncertainty created by the euro zone problems benefitted
the dollar, adding fuel to the short-covering rally that on
Tuesday drove the greenback to a month high of 79.416 against a
basket of major currencies.
 Although comments from Fed officials advocating further
easing steps if needed briefly pushed down the dollar, traders
expect its rally to continue after it rose on Tuesday despite a
sharp fall in U.S. bond yields.
 ""It seems as if the dollar is being bought no matter what
factors are in the market,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
Many traders suspect more buying back of the dollar is likely
ahead of the year-end, when many players close their books.
 The euro was traded at $1.3503 on Wednesday, up 0.1 percent
on the day but not far from a seven-week trough of $1.3446.
 A convincing break there and then at $1.3436, a level
representing the 50 percent retracement of the August to November
rally, could pave the way for the euro to test $1.3333, the peak
of the June-August rise.
 The euro drew marginal support after the Wall Street Journal
reported Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren said the
Fed would need to consider more action if the economy weakens and
that Chicago Fed chief Charles Evans said the $600 billion
earmarked for purchases of Treasury bonds was a ""good place to
start"".
 LOUDER OBJECTIONS
 Their comments came as objections to the Fed's new stimulus
effort have grown steadily louder since November elections swept
Republicans into control of the House of Representatives, with
two U.S. Republican lawmakers now calling on the Fed to focus
solely on inflation and ditch its ""dual mandate"" to promote both
price stability and full employment.
 The dollar kept within sight of a six-week high of 83.60 yen
yen struck on Tuesday, and was last traded at 83.35 yen on
Wednesday, flat on the day.
 While constant selling from Japanese exporters is keeping the
dollar's advance slow, some traders say the greenback could rise
to around 85 yen.
 On the daily ichimoku chart, a break above the top of cloud,
which sat at 84 yen on Wednesday and will be around 83.70 yen for
the next few days, would send a strong bull signal.
 Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar stood at
79.16, not far from a seven-week peak of 79.461 after having
broken the 78.90/79.10 resistance zone.
 It is facing a major support-turned-resistance area between
79.55-80.05, a sustained break of which could point to more
strength in the dollar in the medium term.
 ""It's part of the ongoing trimming of the big trades that
started to be put on in real size in late September of weak
dollar and risky assets in anticipation of Fed QE spilling into
emerging markets,"" said Sean Callow, strategist at Westpac Bank.
 A gauge of investor anxiety, the CBOE Volatility index,
jumped almost 12 percent overnight, marking the biggest one-day
percent rise since mid-August as stock markets in Europe and the
United States fell.
 Investors also dumped commodities, adding pressure to
commodity currencies like the Australian dollar.
 The Aussie dollar traded at $0.9780, up 0.1 percent on the
day after having skidded to $0.9725 on Tuesday, a low not seen
since Oct. 29.
 The slide in the Aussie dollar was worsened by persistent
worries that China, Australia's largest export market, would
tighten monetary policy to keep a lid on inflation and thus risk
slower growth.
 Still, analysts note such worries proved misplaced earlier in
the year and actual activity data from China has surprised on the
upside in the last couple of months.

 By Timothy Heritage and Ilona Wissenbach
 BRUSSELS, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Ireland pledged on Wednesday to
work with a European Union-IMF mission on steps to help a
stricken banking sector, a process which could lead to a bailout
which Dublin has so far baulked at asking for.
 Euro zone finance ministers agreed late on Tuesday that a
team from the European Commission, the International Monetary
Fund and the European Central Bank team would start on Thursday
to examine what measures were needed, if Dublin ultimately
decides to seek aid.
 ""What's here now, is a common determination that we work on
these difficulties ... that work is well underway,"" Irish
Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said.
 Lenihan told state Irish broadcaster RTE that euro zone
peers had welcomed his four-year, 15 billion euros
budget-cutting strategy which he hopes to publish next week.
 ""Our budgetary policy has full confidence among European
partners. But in relation to banking, steps taken to date
require further support,"" he said.
 ""What may be required may not in fact be an actual transfer
of money now but demonstration of how much money can be made
available if further difficulties materialise.""
 In an early indication that financial markets were
unimpressed by Ireland's decision to reject immediate EU
financial assistance, the premium investors charge for holding
Irish 10-year bonds rather than benchmark German Bunds stayed
sky-high at around 570 basis points.
 LCH.Clearnet, a clearing house for sovereign debt, doubled
its margin requirement on Irish bonds to 30 percent of net
positions, an indication of the increased risk of default.
 The cost of insuring against default by Ireland jumped,
five-year credit default swaps widening by 25 basis points on
the day to 545 bps, while those for Spain and Portugal also rose
-- a sign of the contagion that EU policymakers fear most.
 Britain, whose banks have around $150 billion of exposure to
Irish debt, said it stood ready to help.
 ""We're going to do what is in Britain's national interest,""
Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne told reporters ahead
of an EU finance ministers meeting in Brussels.
 ""Ireland is our closest neighbour and it's in Britain's
national interest that the Irish economy is successful and we
have a stable banking system.""
 While Ireland made no request for immediate EU rescue,
resisting pressure to follow in Greece's footsteps, economists
said a state bailout remained a probability even though its
public borrowing needs are funded until mid-2011.
 ""There is an air of inevitability that there will be some
sort of bailout,"" said Alan McQuaid, chief economist at Bloxham
Stockbrokers. ""Why come to Dublin if you are not going to give a
bailout?""
 EU sources have told Reuters Ireland may need assistance of
between 45 billion and 90 billion euros if it asks for help.
 The Irish government hopes to avoid a humiliating rescue
that could further weaken its grip on power but has left the
door open to aid for its banks, which were driven to the brink
by the global financial crisis and a property market crash.
 The action by the euro zone finance ministers echoed a
decision to send an EU-IMF-ECB team to Greece earlier this year
as part of Athens' eventual 110 billion euro rescue.
 Euro zone sources said there was an agreement in principle
to trigger aid for Ireland when the joint mission completes its
consultations -- perhaps in days -- and the aid would not be
just a programme for the banks.
 French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said: ""We are
closer to a question of days rather than six months"".
 
 HIGH STAKES
 The stakes are high even though other European officials
played down a suggestion by European Council President Herman
Van Rompuy, who heads the body that groups the EU's 27 national
governments, that the EU's future could be at stake.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she did not believe the
euro zone was in danger. ""But we are experiencing turmoil and
situations of the kind I wouldn't have dreamed of a year and a
half ago,"" she told ARD television.
 Concern that Ireland's crisis could spread to other weak
economies in the 16-country euro area has unsettled financial
markets and pushed up borrowing costs. 
 ""You have to think the market is going to go after all of
the periphery, trying to force them into a bailout, which should
support Bunds,"" a bond trader in London said.
 Lenihan dismissed suggestions, most notably from German
lawmakers, that Ireland should raise its ultra-low 12.5 percent
corporation tax rate, a magnet for foreign investment, to help
cut its debt. Higher-tax countries have long seen the Irish rate
as a form of unfair competition.
 ""Of course our corporate tax rate is safe,"" he said.
 Bank of Ireland, the country's largest lender, signalled
last week it had suffered a 10 billion euro outflow of deposits
from early August until the end of September.
 Allied Irish Banks, which will be more than 90 percent owned
by the state following a rights issue later this year, will
issue a trading statement later this week with details about its
funding situation.

 By Pedro Nicolaci da Costa
 MONTGOMERY, Ala., Nov 16 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's
latest push to drive down borrowing costs is aimed at
supporting the U.S. economic recovery, not weakening the
dollar, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said on Tuesday.
 The central bank's decision earlier this month to pump an
additional $600 billion into the financial system has drawn
sharp criticism from overseas officials, who see the measure as
a thinly veiled effort to boost U.S. exports via a softer
currency.
 ""There is no monetary policy intent to engineer specific
values -- or even a direction-- for the dollar,"" Lockhart said
in a speech before the Alabama World Affairs Council. ""This
policy was not undertaken to prompt dollar depreciation.""
 Lockhart, in the latest in a string of public remarks by
Fed officials defending the new policy, said a strong U.S.
economy and stable prices are the best way to ensure the dollar
retains its long-run worth.
 Given that backdrop, Lockhart said the Fed would most
likely see the full $600 billion program to buy government
bonds through its announced June completion.
 ""The working assumption should be that we will in all
probability complete the program in the eight months that it's
been designed for,"" he said.
 Still, Lockhart added that he would not completely rule out
a mid-course reevaluation if economic growth proved much
stronger than expected.
 STAVING OFF DEFLATION
 Lockhart said the new drive to lower borrowing costs was
aimed at reducing the risk of deflation and supporting a
recovery that remains too sluggish to put a dent in the U.S.
unemployment rate, which has hovered near 9.6 percent for
several months.
 After emerging from the deepest recession since the Great
Depression last summer, the U.S. economy has grown unevenly,
registering a modest 2 percent annualized rate of expansion in
the third quarter.
 ""The current policy is resolutely designed to support the
expansion of the economy and to maintain inflation near the
(Fed's) desired objective for price stability,"" Lockhart said.
 The Fed has stated that it would like to see inflation
running around 2 percent or a bit below. Consumer price
readings have been coming in well below that, raising fears of
a deflationary spiral of falling prices and wages that would
weigh on the economy.
 Lockhart said the risk of such an outcome had decreased
recently, according to market measures of inflation
expectations, and he credited the Fed's well-telegraphed move
for the shift.
 ""This policy has already shown some signs of success by
altering inflation expectations and reducing the risk of
unwanted disinflation,"" Lockhart said.
 He argued that inflation was an easier challenge for policy
makers to deal with than deflation.
 Domestic critics of the Fed's new bond-purchasing policy,
known as quantitative easing in financial markets, see it as
possibly sowing the seeds of future inflation.
 Two U.S. Republican lawmakers said on Tuesday the Fed
should focus solely on inflation and ditch its ""dual mandate""
to promote both price stability and full employment.
 Lockhart, who said it was too early to comment on such a
proposal, cautioned that Americans should not expect too much
from policy, which he said can only help buttress demand in an
environment that remains difficult.

crisis has shown weaker countries must become more competitive,
but the euro zone is not at risk, German Chancellor Angela
Merkel said late on Tuesday.
 ""I don't think the euro zone is in danger. But we are
experiencing turmoil and situations of the kind I wouldn't have

 ""The most important thing is that, aside from the rescue
measures that have been agreed, we coordinate our economic
strength better with one another,"" she added. ""That means that

 Merkel, who said on Monday the European Union would fail if
the euro currency failed, noted that Greece, Spain and Portugal
were working hard to achieve this.
 Asked about Ireland, whose debt problems have sparked
speculation it could need a bailout, Merkel said:
 ""We have a rescue shield in case a country needs aid, which
I don't see at all at the moment. But if a country needs it, it
can request aid if the euro zone as a whole is in jeopardy.""

 * EU-Morocco fish pact must aid Sahrawis - EU fish chief
 (Adds U.N. Security Council discussion of Western Sahara)
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Moroccan security force action
against protesters in Western Sahara has boosted opposition in
the EU to a treaty that would allow European fishing in waters
off the territory, activists and EU lawmakers said on Tuesday.
 ""We will not accept an EU fisheries accord with Morocco if
it includes the waters of Western Sahara,"" Raul Romeva, a
Spanish lawmaker and member of the European Green party, told
fellow deputies during a European Parliament hearing.
 Romeva, who has led debate on the issue, said European
lawmakers from across the political spectrum -- including
Socialists, Liberals, Conservatives and Greens -- are beginning
to question the accord, which is planned for March 2011.
 At issue is the renewal of a four-year fishing pact whereby
the EU acquires the right from Morocco to fish in its waters,
including those belonging to Western Sahara, a former Spanish
colony annexed by Morocco in 1975.
 That annexation prompted a rebellion by the opposition
Polisario Front. The United Nations brokered a ceasefire in
1991 but a political settlement to Africa's longest-running
territorial dispute has eluded negotiators.
 Polisario said in a letter to the U.N. Security Council on
Monday that more than 36 Sahrawis protesting for better housing
and working conditions last week died in clashes with Moroccan
security forces and 163 were detained, and demanded a U.N.
investigation of the clashes.
 The Moroccan government has denied excessive use of force
and accused Sahrawi activists of ""brutal practices"" including
cutting the throat of a Moroccan policeman.
 In New York, a closed-door Security Council meeting was
briefed by a senior U.N. peacekeeping official on Tuesday on
the clashes and ""deplored the violence,"" British Ambassador
Mark Lyall Grant, current council president, told reporters.
 The meeting ended without immediate action, diplomats said.
Developing countries and human rights groups want U.N.
peacekeepers in Western Sahara to take on rights monitoring,
something Morocco and its ally on the council, France, oppose.
 A senior Western diplomat said the divided council was
unlikely to mount the fact-finding mission sought by Polisario
but that there could be a case for it making a trip, possibly
next year, to the territory, which it last visited in 1995.
 SARDINES FOR EUROPE
 In Brussels, Ivo Vajgl of the EU Liberal Democrats said
EU deputies opposed to a new fishing deal should turn to their
national governments for support.
 European fishermen widely fish the waters of Western Sahara
under a current 2007 agreement, mainly for sardines and octopus
destined for European restaurants and processing plants.
 Activists estimate about 70 percent to 80 percent of fish
caught under the fisheries accord are caught in the disputed
waters. That figure is disputed because of the difficulty in
tracking fishing boats and the fish themselves.
 The deal by the EU, which champions human rights and
governance in its diplomatic and trade relations, contrasts
with an agreement between the United States and Morocco, whose
effects stop at Morocco's southern border with Western Sahara.
 Responding to mounting concerns, EU fisheries chief Maria
Damanaki has said the EU Executive Commission can only propose
a renewal if Morocco proves the deal will benefit Sahrawis.
 ""For that to be substantiated, an assessment needs to be
carried out. This assessment would have to be based on solid
information and facts. There is no other way,"" Damanaki told EU
deputies last month.
 EU deputies on Tuesday said any assessment should include
input from Polisario.
 Aminatou Haidar, a prize-winning human rights activist,
warned against unchecked mining operations for Western Sahara's
phosphates and sands, which -- unbound by state-to-state
accords -- are largely being exploited by foreign operators.
 ""This will extinguish the mining resources of Western
Sahara. It will have very serious repercussions on Western
Sahara's economy and environment,"" Haidar told deputies.

 * Move may buy some time for government but risks abound
 * EU indicates bailout is not entirely off the cards
 
 By Luke Baker
 BRUSSELS, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Ireland resisted pressure to
request direct financial aid from the European Union on Tuesday,
but agreed to let EU, IMF and European Central Bank experts
visit Ireland to look at how to deal with its banking problems.
 The decision -- neither requesting a full bailout nor
rejecting outside help altogether -- could create more
uncertainty on financial markets, where Irish sovereign bond
yields have risen to record highs as the risk of an
unsustainable debt spiral has grown.
 But it could also allow Prime Minister Brian Cowen to focus
attention on disarray in the banking sector, caused largely by
the banks themselves, rather than on the huge deficit in public
finances which is the responsibility of his government.
 That may buy Cowen's government some time, or at least
create a breathing space, before a by-election on Nov. 25 which
could reduce its parliamentary majority to just two seats. But
it has not ruled out the possibility of a bailout later on.
 Before euro zone ministers met in Brussels on Tuesday, Cowen
repeated that Dublin did not need EU financial assistance
because the government was well funded, with no need to return
to markets to finance its debts until mid-2011.
 But EU officials made clear that Ireland's bad banks problem
was unsustainable and would require outside advice and
assistance. On that score, Ireland appears to have conceded.
 
 MISSION TO VISIT IRELAND
 The EU commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, Olli
Rehn, said a team of EU, IMF and ECB experts would visit Ireland
to carry out a technical assessment -- a development not unlike
the steps taken to help Greece earlier this year.
 He said the team would focus on the need to restructure the
banking sector, where the two largest banks, Allied Irish Banks
and Bank of Ireland, are in a sorry state.
 Both are heavily exposed to the country's wrecked property
market and face the threat of not being able to roll over their
debts, raising concerns about their liquidity and solvency.
 The arrival of an outside team of experts could focus more
attention on those problems and uncover more shortcomings, which
could increase the downward pressure on the banks' share prices
and their liquidity positions.
 If that is the case, it could in turn increase pressure on
the government, which may ultimately have no choice but to turn
to the EU's financial stability funds for help.
 Rehn indicated this eventuality was being prepared for,
telling reporters the ""intensification of talks"" with Ireland
could be regarded as preparation of a potential programme of aid
to Ireland, ""should it be necessary"".
 He said it was too early to say when the intensified talks
would be concluded but France's economy minister, Christine
Lagarde, said the review of Ireland was more likely to take days
than months.
 In deciding not to seek direct help on Tuesday from the EU
and IMF, which together have 750 billion euros ($1 trillion) of
financial support mechanisms at their disposal, Ireland has
signalled it hopes to resolve the worst of its budget deficit
problems before mid-2011, when it will have to think about
raising funds again.
 In rejecting an EU sovereign bailout for now, but accepting
it may need help with its banking system, Ireland may be hoping
to decouple the issues, at least in the minds of voters.
 By trying to create discrete problems and allowing the EU,
IMF and ECB to help out on the bigger and more immediate of them
-- the banks -- Cowen may be able to focus his political
attentions more acutely on his pressing deficit issues.
 But it would be a tall order for any politician to withstand
the pressure for an EU bailout when other countries such as
Portugal and Spain fear contagion, and at the same time keep
voters happy before an election, resolve a banking crisis and
convince financial markets that everything will be better soon.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Nov 16 (Reuters) - World stocks fell for the
seventh straight session on Tuesday as growing tensions about
Europe's debt problems and expectations of tighter credit in
China weighed on commodity prices and hurt investor sentiment.
 The U.S. dollar rose to a seven-week high against major
currencies as anxiety about the outcome of Ireland's debt
crisis sent the euro below $1.35.
 Major U.S. stock indexes lost more than 1.5 percent while
Japanese stocks were headed for a tepid start, with Nikkei
futures traded in Chicago  flat at 9,705.00 points.
 Ireland's bond yields rose while euro zone finance
ministers discussed in Brussels a solution for the crisis.
 A joint mission of the European Central Bank, the EU
Commission and the International Monetary Fund will head to
Ireland in the next few days to look for ways to support the
country, especially its banks, the ministers said.
 Despite the apparent readiness of the European Union to
come up with a rescue plan for Ireland, Dublin resisted
agreeing to a state bailout, saying that only its banks may
need help.
 ""There's a global concern that if Ireland needs aid, it
could become a domino effect with other countries,"" said Cort
Gwon, director of trading strategies and research at FBN
Securities in New York.
 ""Especially at such a sensitive time in the economy to have
a setback in Europe could mean a setback for the rest of the
world, too.""
 The premium investors demand to hold Irish government bonds
rather than German benchmarks   widened
to 581.6 basis points from around 562 basis points at Monday's
settlement.
 The cost of insuring against debt default in Ireland,
Portugal and Greece also crept higher, even as EU Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said Portugal's
challenges were ""very different"" from those of Ireland.
 World stocks fell 1.77 percent, according to the MSCI
All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS>. The index has lost
about 4.0 percent since Nov. 5 when it closed higher for the
last time.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares ended down 2.3 percent at 1,086.61 points.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 178.47 points,

1,178.34. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> sank 43.98 points,
or 1.75 percent, to 2,469.84.
 The euro  slipped 0.77 percent to $1.3478 as anxiety
about Ireland eclipsed a stronger-than-expected reading of
German ZEW institute's economic sentiment index.
 ""What's the driving the euro is just all the sovereign risk
out of Europe,"" said Jack Iles, a portfolio manager at MFC
Global Investment Management in Boston. ""That's driving
sentiment across the board for risk assets and that probably
will not go away in the next 48 hours.""
 The dollar gained 1.0 percent versus a basket of major
currencies, according to the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>. Against
the Japanese yen, the dollar  rose 0.28 percent to
83.36.

 The reports increased expectations that China will further
tighten monetary policy to help fight inflation. Commodity
prices fell as a result, as China is one of the world's top
consumers of raw materials.
 U.S. crude oil prices  lost 2.97 percent to $82.34 a

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Nov 16 (Reuters) - The euro fell to its lowest
level in seven weeks against the dollar on Tuesday as investors
grew petrified by prospects of an Irish bailout, prompting a
sell-off in the single currency that could run for some time.
 Fears about contagion in the euro zone swept through
financial markets, pushing stocks and commodities sharply lower
and hoisting the safe-haven dollar to a seven-week peak versus
a basket of currencies.
 The euro dipped below $1.3450 after taking out options
barriers and significant support in the $1.3550-60 area. The
single currency will likely stay weak in the near term as
investors focus on debt troubles in Ireland and other European
peripheral economies, analysts said.
 ""The story will remain the same until we reach an
equilibrium. I still see scope for the euro to decline to
$1.3250, which represents the 100-day moving average,"" said
Greg Michalowski, chief currency analyst at the New York-based
online broker FXDD.
 ""The market acts like it's still long the euro and I think
there is still liquidation of euro long positions going on,""
Michalowski said.
 Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed
that currency speculators cut long euro positions significantly
in the latest week as they continued to trim bets against the
dollar. [IMM/FX]
 As market participants continued to liquidate their long
bets on the euro, European officials are weighing a rescue
package of 80 billion to 100 billion euros for Ireland and a
separate, smaller bailout for its banking sector, the Wall
Street Journal reported on Tuesday. For details, see
[ID:nWBT014242]
 Ireland has come under intense pressure over its debt
crunch in recent weeks, with a top European Union official
saying the future of the 27-country union was at stake.

 GREECE MAY MISS FISCAL TARGETS
 Adding to worries was news Greece will most probably miss
its fiscal targets this year and next and that Austria has not
yet submitted its contribution to the aid package for Greece
for December. An official from Austria said it is not seeking
to block aid for Greece. [ID:nLDE6AF1R6] [ID:nLDE6AF1Z8]
 The euro hit a session low of $1.3446 on trading platform
EBS , its weakest since Sept. 28, before pulling back
to trade at $1.3484, off 0.7 percent. Upside is seen limited
with dealers noting real money selling and offers at $1.35.
 Support levels include $1.3463, a 50 percent retracement of
the euro's September-November rally, and $1.3364, a 38.2
percent retracement of its June-November rally.
 Traders also noted key support at $1.3334, the euro's high
set in early August before markets began to speculate about the
Federal Reserve's second-round of bond buying.
 European finance ministers are meeting on Tuesday and
Wednesday and will try to reach a deal to provide aid to
Ireland. Some analysts say a bailout agreement could actually
be bearish for the euro.
 Kathy Lien, director of research at GFT in New York,
pointed out that when news of a Greek bailout came out, the
euro fell about 100 pips against the dollar and weakened
further in the weeks that followed.
 ""I don't see solid support in the euro until $1.34,"" Lien
said.
 The euro gained in early trading after a survey by the ZEW
think-tank showed German analyst and investor sentiment rose
more than expected in November. [ID:nDEP003399]

 By Carmel Crimmins
 DUBLIN, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Ireland's government is no closer
to publishing a four-year plan for tackling its budget deficit
despite its financial crisis which is vexing European Union
chiefs and provoking a sell-off in world stocks and the euro.
 Prime Minister Brian Cowen told parliament on Tuesday that
his government was still discussing what fiscal measures to take
to tackle the worst deficit in Europe, despite growing anxiety
in Brussels that Ireland's woes could destabilise the euro zone.
 ""I said before that I had hoped it (the four-year plan)
would be available for publication, assuming approval, ... next
week but I can't anticipate the outcome of discussions in
relation to it. We are working to an indicative schedule,"" Cowen
said.
 The deeply unpopular premier is trying to resist pressure
from the European Central Bank and euro zone peers to tap
emergency funding that would impose tough conditions and make it
even more difficult for his government to cling on to power.
 Cowen wants time to prove that Ireland can handle its
finances but a delay in the four-year plan, which was originally
meant to be unveiled in mid-November, and the information vacuum
that has ensued is doing his cause no favours.
 World stocks fell for the seventh straight session and the
euro dropped below $1.35 amid concerns Ireland's sovereign debt
crisis could destabilise other economies in the euro zone such
as Portugal and Spain.
 
 LAUGHING STOCK
 The government changed the parliamentary schedule on Tuesday
so Cowen could issue a statement on the economy, raising
expectations at home and internationally, that an important
announcement was imminent.
 Instead, he reiterated the government's previous goals,
prompting criticism from the opposition benches.
 ""I'm not quite sure why you made this statement today,"" said
Eamon Gilmore, the leader of the centre-left Labour party.
 ""I'm not sure what it adds to sense of confidence or lack of
it in the country. It certainly doesn't add to clarity about
what is taking place at the moment in relation to our finances.""
 After initially winning plaudits for taking swift action to
deal with Ireland's deteriorating finances, Cowen has lost
credibility at home and abroad for having to ratchet up the cost
of bailing out the banks, putting a heavier strain on a weak
economy and stretched national finances.
 Any external aid package could see the EU and the
International Monetary Fund impose harsher fiscal measures than
Cowen and his fragile coalition are planning.
 A bailout would be a humiliation for Ireland and in
particular for Cowen, whose Fianna Fail party prides itself on
its role in the fight for Irish independence from Britain.
 On Tuesday Enda Kenny, the leader of the main opposition
party warned Cowen in parliament about letting someone else make
decisions for Ireland.
 ""This is a democracy and people died on the street for it,
it will not be closed down by incompetence. It will not become
the laughing stock of Europe.""

 NEW YORK, Nov 16 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a seven-week
low against the dollar on Tuesday amid heightened worries about
a deepening euro zone debt crisis, with losses accelerating
after breaking key support levels.
 The safe-haven dollar climbed to a seven-week peak versus a

 The euro dipped below $1.3450 after taking out options

not yet submitted its contribution to the aid package for
Greece for December. An official from Austria said it is not

 The euro hit a session low of $1.3446 on trading platform
EBS , its weakest since Sept. 28, before pulling back
to trade at $1.3484, off 0.7 percent. Upside is seen limited
with dealers noting real money selling and offers at $1.35.
 Support levels include $1.3463, a 50 percent retracement of
the euro's September-November rally, and $1.3364, a 38.2
percent retracement of its June-November rally.
 Traders also noted key support at $1.3334, the euro's high
set in early August before markets began to speculate about the
Federal Reserve's second-round of bond buying.
 European finance ministers are meeting on Tuesday and
Wednesday and will try to reach a deal to provide aid to
Ireland. Some analysts said the euro may see a reprieve on news
of an agreement as it would ease concern that Irish debt woes
could spread to other economies such as Portugal and Spain.
 But Kathy Lien, director of research at GFT in New York,
said an agreement on a bailout would be bearish for the euro.
""On the day news of a Greek bailout emerged, the euro fell
about 100 pips and went on to fall further in the weeks that
followed. I don't see any solid support in the euro until
$1.34,"" she said.

 * EU-S.Korea trade pact will hurt U.S., Australia,Pernod CEO
 * Industry would back EU-Brazil pact - Scotch whisky group
 
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Nov 16 (Reuters) - European Union demands that
India open its doors to European whisky and vodka are among the
factors holding up a free-trade agreement between the two
powerhouses, EU spirits producers said Tuesday.
 A wide-ranging EU-India trade agreement was supposed to be
sealed by year-end, but EU officials now say negotiations will
continue into 2011.
 ""We would rather see the EU take its time and get it right,""
said Jamie Fortescue, director-general of the European Spirits
Organisation, on the sidelines of a conference on the industry's
export prospects.
 India is resisting dismantling its 150 percent tariffs on
EU-made spirits, a factor producers of whisky and vodka say has
kept the EU's market share at 1 percent in India, even though
the country is the single biggest consumer of whisky.
 Another major hurdle in the talks is disagreement about how
freely Indian professionals can travel and work in the EU.
 ""Once a deal is done we are expecting double-digit year-on-
year growth in India,"" said Pierre Pringuet, Chief Executive
Officer of French drinks group Pernod Ricard .
 A free trade deal with South Korea -- agreed last month and
expected to launch in July 2011 -- will help EU industry ""catch
up"" with Chilean exporters, who dominate South Korea's wine
market, Pringuet said.
 Europe's chief trade negotiator, Karel De Gucht, told
executives on Tuesday Europe will fight for more access to
foreign markets, particularly in the booming South Asian region.
 A global trade pact at the World Trade Organization is
struggling to gain the political momentum needed for its
completion next year because of U.S. doubts about the value of a
deal, De Gucht said.
 Yet the United States is among several countries backing a
plan by De Gucht to convene a meeting of ""major stakeholders
next year,"" the EU trade chief said, declining to give details.
 
 HOPES FOR BRAZIL
 Country-by-country trade accords may be more constructive
than negotiations with sprawling regions such as Latin America's
Mercosur, whose reach includes Brazil and Argentina along with
other countries, said Martin Bell, of the Scotch Whisky
Association.
 Recently revived, those talks are in trouble again, making a
direct deal with Brazil increasingly attractive to impatient EU
exporters.
 ""Perhaps it would make sense with Mercosur to say it's a
very difficult negotiation, so let's just go with Brazil first.
If the Commission were to suggest that, we would support it,""
Bell said.
 European sales of spirits reached 58 billion euros in 2009,
according to an Ernst & Young study. With exports worth 5.7
billion euros in 2009, the industry is the largest exporter in
the EU's agro-food industry, the report says.
 So high are expectations for other market openings as a
result of upcoming pacts with the EU that investors in Britain
have poured 800 million pounds into whisky distilleries since
2006, according to the Scotch Whisky Association.
 ""We are hoping for the Asian decade,"" Bell said.

 * Loose labour market can keep wage growth in check
 * Cbank next meets on rate policy on Nov. 29

(Adds more comments, detail)
 BUDAPEST, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank will
have to determine in coming months whether loose labour market
conditions will be sufficient to keep price growth in check
despite an upswing in the economy, the bank's governor said.
 The country's economy could grow above its potential rate
next year, and the big fall in inflation expectations seen
during the financial crisis has stalled recently, Andras Simor
said in a lecture to university students on Tuesday.
 ""Employment began to expand at the beginning of 2010,
however, this was not accompanied by a fall in unemployment,""
Simor said.
 ""The activity rate has begun to increase, there are more and
more people in the labour market looking for jobs, which results
in a relatively loose labour market, which, we hope, will not
allow a jump in wage growth and will help disinflation.""
The bank left its main lending rate unchanged at a record
low of 5.25 percent at its last meeting in October, for the
sixth month running. Rate setters will next discuss rate policy
on Nov. 29.
 The economy grew at a faster-than-expected rate of 1.6
percent in the third quarter, largely on the back of exports but
also thanks to some improvement in consumption.
 Simor said even with faster growth, Hungary's high public
debt -- which fell to 81.4 percent of GDP by the end of the
third quarter from 83.7 percent in June, primarily due to a
stronger forint -- would remain a problem in years ahead.
 ""The decline in net external debt as a percentage of GDP has
been minimal, and in the longer term we expect a very slow and
protracted decline,"" Simor said.
 ""And even this slow decline is based on the assumption of
... 2.5 percent potential growth and a nearly 4 percent foreign
trade surplus (to annual GDP).""
 He said a very disciplined fiscal policy was needed in the
next 8 to 10 years for debt to fall to manageable levels.
 ""We can expect a long and protracted process, as a result of
which Hungary's vulnerability can decline only slowly in the
next 10 years,"" Simor said.
 Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Monday Hungary could
reduce state debt below 70 percent of GDP by 2014-2015 if it can
keep economic growth above 3 percent and the budget deficit
below 3 percent in coming years.
 The 2011 budget targets a deficit of 2.94 percent of GDP,
the lowest since Hungary joined the European Union in 2004
thanks to new windfall taxes on banks, energy, retail and
telecommunications firms and money from private pension funds.

 * U.S. House sponsors also say action needed
(Adds letter from House lawmakers)
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - A coalition of U.S. steel
manufacturers and other business groups urged the Senate on
Tuesday to pass legislation in coming weeks to pressure China
to raise the value of its currency.
 ""The Fair Currency Coalition believes it is imperative that
the Senate help Main Street America by counteracting currency
undervaluation by China and any other country engaging in this
mercantilist practice. The time for action is now,"" the group
said in a letter to each member of the Senate.
 The group, which also includes textile producers and other
domestic manufacturers that compete with imports from China,
urged the Senate to pass a bill approved by the House of
Representatives in late September.
 In addition, two co-authors of the House bill released
their own letter urging Democratic and Republican Senate
leaders to agree to schedule a vote on the bill.
 ""With nearly 15 million Americans out of work, it is
vitally important that Congress act now to give the
administration the necessary tools that will put a stop to
China's currency manipulation,"" Representatives Tim Murphy, a
Republican, and Tim Ryan, a Democrat, said. 
 Congress has returned for a post-election session that is
likely to focus mainly on government spending and whether to
extend tax cuts passed during the administration of former
President George W. Bush.
 Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said earlier on Tuesday
that senators would discuss whether to vote on currency
legislation, but no decision had been made.
 The House bill would die if not passed by the Senate before
lawmakers adjourn for the year. Proponents of currency
legislation would have to start from scratch after a new
Congress is seated in January.
 NOVEMBER ELECTIONS
 Republicans won control of the House in November elections
and reduced the Democratic majority in the Senate, and they may
not be as supportive of the measure.
 The bill passed by the House would clarify that the
Commerce Department has the authority under current law to
apply countervailing duties against countries with
significantly undervalued currencies.
 It is directed mainly at China, which many economists and
lawmakers believe deliberately undervalues its currency by as
much as 15 percent to 40 percent.
 ""The bill is a targeted remedy that sends an
across-the-board message. Enactment of the bill would have a
positive impact on the U.S. economy without incurring any new
public debt or significant budgetary expenditures,"" the Fair
Currency Coalition said.
 Many other business groups, such as the U.S.-China Business
Council and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, oppose the House
bill. They agree that China's currency is undervalued, but say
passing the legislation could backfire on the United States.
They recommend diplomatic pressure to get Beijing to move.

 By David Lawder
 WASHINGTON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - The world-wide financial
crisis has made clear to reformers and policymakers in China
that depending on overextended American consumers was not a
good growth model for it, nor for the world, U.S. Treasury
Under Secretary Lael Brainard said on Tuesday.
 Brainard, who sat in on bilateral talks between Chinese
President Hu Jintao and President Barack Obama at last week's
G20 meetings in Seoul, said Hu ""affirmed strong resolve"" to
move forward with a more flexible exchange rate regime and
reported on progress in lifting the yuan's value.
 ""There is a recognition coming out of the crisis that this
growth model needs to change and more broadly there needs to be
a shift in global demand,"" Brainard said.
 Hu is due to visit Washington early in 2011.
 G20 leaders also pledged to enhance exchange rate
flexibility to reflect underlying economic fundamentals, and
Brainard said exchange rates will be at the heart of Group of
20 talks in coming months aimed at setting a framework for
correcting global economic imbalances.
 ""Exchange rates will be a central focus of those
discussions,"" she told a conference sponsored by the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.
 ""We are working hard to ensure that China makes progress in
allowing its exchange rate to appreciate in response to market
forces,"" Brainard said.
 She said Beijing has allowed an ""accelerated pace of
appreciation"" in recent months. ""If sustained, the pace of
China's appreciation would make a material contribution to
addressing the undervaluation of its currency,"" she added.
 Brainard handled last week's negotiations for the United
States over language in a statement by Group of 20 leaders in
Seoul, South Korea.
 The G20 summit of rich and emerging-market countries agreed
to set ""indicative guidelines"" for measuring imbalances between
their multispeed economies. But they called a timeout to let
tempers cool and charged finance ministers with working out
details in coming months.
 Regarding the failure of the United States and South Korea
to sign revisions to a stalled free trade agreement in Seoul,
Brainard said that while both countries were committed to a
deal, ""we weren't there yet in Seoul.""
 Negotiators in Seoul failed to resolve U.S. concerns that
the pact signed three years ago does not go far enough to open
South Korean markets to U.S. beef and autos.
 ""What's more important is that we get a good deal"" on a
U.S.-Korea trade deal, Brainard said.

 * Irish PM says EU discussing ways of cutting funding costs
 * EU council president says euro zone in ""survival crisis""
 * Partners say Irish aid conditional on adjustment programme

(Adds Irish PM to parliament, draft euro zone statement)
 By Jan Strupczewski and Julien Toyer
 BRUSSELS, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Ireland said it was discussing
stabilisation measures with its European partners on Tuesday and
ways to cut its heavily indebted banks' funding costs in what a
top EU official called a ""survival crisis"" for the euro zone.
 A euro zone source said finance ministers of the 16-nation
currency area meeting in Brussels would declare support for
Dublin's austerity measures and express readiness to help
financially, if it asks for aid, but would not announce any
practical measures.
 In Dublin, Prime Minister Brian Cowen rebuffed calls to
request a bailout, saying the government was fully funded until
mid-2011, and insisted that only the banks may need help.
 ""The cost of money is simply too high,"" Cowen said in
parliament. ""What we are doing is discussing with our European
partners as to what stabilisation (measures are) ... necessary.""
 European Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said the EU
executive, the European Central Bank and the International
Monetary Fund were all working on ways ""to resolve the problems
of the Irish banking sector"".
 The euro fell by a cent to $1.35 and European stocks shed
2.2 percent on the day as investors worried that the meeting
would not bring a solution to Ireland's debt crunch.
 Senior officials agreed on a draft terms of reference on
Ireland just before the ministers met, and the text could still
change in the course of discussions on Tuesday evening.
 Some ministers said before the talks that loans from EU
emergency funds could only be granted to a government that
signed a formal austerity programme with conditions set and
enforced by the European Commission and the IMF.
 European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, who chairs EU
summits, told a Brussels think-tank the future of the 27-nation
union was at stake in the latest spasm of a debt crisis that
began a year ago with Greece.
 ""We are in a survival crisis,"" he told the European Policy
Centre. ""We all have to work together in order to survive with
the euro zone because if we don't survive with the euro zone, we
will not survive with the European Union.""
 But Rehn cautioned against alarmism, saying: ""It's not a
matter of the survival of the euro.""
 The European Central Bank and some euro zone peers want
Dublin to take a quick decision on applying for aid amid signs
that market contagion is spreading to fellow struggler Portugal
and beginning to hurt Spain.
 EU sources say possible aid under discussion for Ireland
ranges from 45 billion to 90 billion euros ($63-123 billion),
depending on whether Dublin needs support for its banks.
 In Washington, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said
Europe was capable of dealing with the debt crisis but needed to
act ""very, very quickly"", combining temporary financial support
with reforms that resolve underlying problems.
 His remarks appeared to reflect U.S. concern that, if left
to fester, they could spread and imperil global recovery.
 Failure to reach agreement at the talks, which widen to all
EU finance ministers on Wednesday, could make markets even more
jittery and push borrowing costs still higher for Ireland and
other countries on the euro zone's periphery.

 CONDITIONS
 Eager to save face and protect a slim parliamentary
majority, the Irish government has sought support for its banks,
which were driven to the brink by the global financial crisis
and a property market crash, without a formal state bailout.
 In an indication of the sort of terms Brussels may face
pressure to set, a senior German lawmaker said Ireland should
raise its ultra-low 12.5 percent corporation tax rate, a magnet
for foreign investment, to help cut its debt.
 Higher-tax countries have long seen the Irish rate as a form
of unfair competition.
 Ireland's bond yields have soared in the past two weeks and
its state-guaranteed banks are largely shut out of private
sector interbank lending and reliant on the ECB for funds.
 This has helped push up borrowing costs of other countries
on the euro zone's periphery, such as Spain and Portugal.
Spanish short-term debt financing costs jumped at an auction of
12- and 18-month treasury bills on Tuesday.
 Spanish Treasury Secretary Carlos Ocana pressed Ireland to
come to a resolution quickly to end market uncertainties. ""The
important thing is that Ireland makes a decision as soon as
possible,"" he told reporters in Madrid.
 ECB executive board member Juergen Stark said the central
bank would press on with scaling back lending support to banks
in the new year in a move bound to increase pressure on Irish
and Portuguese banks.
 The Irish coalition government has been reluctant to apply a
politically embarrassing bailout, partly because it faces a
by-election it can ill afford to lose on Nov. 25 and also
because it wants to preserve its sovereignty.
 
 SPILLOVER
 The risk premium investors charge for holding Irish 10-year
bonds rather than benchmark German Bunds widened to 585 basis
points and the cost of insuring Irish, Portuguese and Greek debt
against default rose up as peripheral euro zone bonds remained
under stress ahead of the Brussels meeting.
 European Central Bank Vice-President Vitor Constancio said
that if Ireland decided to request aid, which it had not yet
done, it would not necessarily force other countries, such as
his native Portugal, to follow suit.
 The ministers were also expected to discuss a future euro
zone crisis resolution mechanism, which Germany wants to start
from 2013, replacing the 440-billion-euro European Financial
Stability Facility set up after Greece sought help.
 Ireland and Greece says Germany has aggravated problems by
pushing the idea of asset value reductions or ""haircuts"" for
private bondholders under the planned permanent rescue
mechanism, raising the spectre of potential defaults.

 TORONTO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar shed more
than a cent against the greenback on Tuesday, hitting its
lowest level in nearly three weeks, as commodity prices and
equity markets slumped and weak domestic data fueled concerns
about economic growth.
 The currency  fell as low as C$1.0252 to the U.S.
dollar, or 97.54 U.S. cents, by late morning, its weakest level
since Oct. 28.
 North American equities sold off hard amid festering

 Prices for key Canadian commodities, such as oil, base
metals and gold, were also down sharply as the U.S. dollar

[GOl] FRX/]
 ""I don't think there's been one particular trigger for
this,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at TD
Securities.
 ""What we saw last week was very definitely another ramp-up
in speculative risk positions, long Canadian dollar positions,
which I would imagine ... would have been unwound over the
course of the past couple days as the Canadian dollar has
strengthened.""
 Osborne noted that talk of larger investors ""starting to
tidy up positions"" and perhaps liquidating some riskier assets
ahead of the year-end, may signal a new short-term trend.
 Adding extra pressure on Canada's currency, domestic
manufacturing sales were in September, as expected, pressured
by weak auto production, a strong currency and sagging exports,
which are all putting the brakes on economic growth.
[ID:nN1699569]
 The Canadian dollar was already an underperformer before
the figures came out in early morning, but Osborne said it did
have a modest impact and probably encouraged a little more
selling.
 ""Softer data from Canada this morning which we can't really
ignore either ... does suggest that the second half of the year
does appear to be gearing down quite significantly compared to
very strong growth in the first half of the year for Canada.""
 At 12:33 p.m. (1733 GMT), the Canadian dollar  was
at C$1.0244 to the U.S. dollar, or 97.62 U.S. cents, down
sharply from C$1.0089 to the U.S. dollar, or 99.12 U.S. cents,
at Monday's close.
 The session saw a break in a recent short-term range for
the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian currency of around C$0.9980
to C$1.0160, with parity constituting a very strong recent
support level for the greenback.
 The next key barrier for the U.S. dollar against Canada
lies near the 100- and 200-day moving averages around C$1.03.
Osborne said a break of that area could take the Canadian
currency back to around C$1.0650, to weakness last seen in
August.
 Canadian bond prices rebounded on Tuesday, as renewed risk
aversion and the soft Canadian data saw investors flock to the
safety of government debt.
 The two-year bond  rose 10 Canadian cents to
yield 1.585 percent, while the 10-year bond  gained
40 Canadian cents to yield 3.097 percent.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Nov 16 (Reuters) - World stocks fell for the
seventh straight session on Tuesday as growing tensions about
Europe's debt problems and expectations of tighter credit in
China weighed on commodity prices and hurt investor sentiment.
 The U.S. dollar remained at a seven-week high against major
currencies as anxiety about the outcome of Ireland's debt
crisis sent the euro below $1.35.
 Ireland's bond yields rose while euro zone finance
ministers discussed in Brussels a solution for the crisis. The
officials were weighing a rescue package of 80 billion to 100
billion euros for the country, the Wall Street Journal
reported, but Dublin resisted a state bailout, saying that only
its banks may need help.
 ""There's a global concern that if Ireland needs aid, it
could become a domino effect with other countries,"" said Cort
Gwon, director of trading strategies and research at FBN
Securities in New York.
 ""Especially at such a sensitive time in the economy to have
a setback in Europe could mean a setback for the rest of the
world, too.""
 The premium investors demand to hold Irish government bonds
rather than German benchmarks   widened
to 587.5 basis points from around 562 basis points at Monday's
settlement. The cost of insuring against debt default in
Ireland, Portugal and Greece also crept higher.
 World stocks fell 2.08 percent according to the MSCI
All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS>. The index has lost
more than 4.0 percent since Nov. 5, when it closed higher for
the last time.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares ended down 2.3 percent at 1,086.61 points.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 199.09
points, or 1.78 percent, at 11,002.88, while the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> lost 20.86 points, or 1.74 percent, to
1,176.89. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> declined 43.73
points, or 1.74 percent, at 2,470.09.
 The euro  slipped 0.77 percent to $1.3478 as anxiety

38,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2010 12:48PM ET</span>",US Republicans want Fed focus solely on inflation," WASHINGTON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Two U.S. Republican
lawmakers said on Tuesday the Federal Reserve should focus
solely on inflation and ditch its ""dual mandate"" to promote
both price stability and full employment.
 The pressure from Senator Bob Corker and Representative
Mike Pence adds to the pile of international criticism over the
central bank's plan to buy an additional $600 billion in
government bonds to try to speed up a sluggish economic
recovery.
 Opponents worry the program will weaken the dollar and sow
the seeds of inflation at home and abroad without doing much to
lift U.S. economic growth.
 Pence said in a statement that the Fed's dual mandate
policy had ""failed"" and he would introduce legislation on
Tuesday to strike that provision from the Federal Reserve Act
of 1977.
 ""With no explicit plan for when or how this quantitative
easing will be withdrawn, the Federal Reserve could do more for
the American economy by focusing singularly on maintaining the
value of the dollar and protecting the purchasing power of
Americans,"" Pence wrote.
 The European Central Bank is among central banks with a
single mandate to focus on inflation. The Bank of England must
write an explanatory letter when it misses its inflation target
by too wide of a margin, and did so earlier on Tuesday.
 ""Providing our central bank with a clear and explicit focus
on keeping inflation low will serve America better than the
broader mandate approach we have today,"" Corker said in a
statement.
 Republican lawmakers, fresh off of midterm election
victories that gave them control of the House of
Representatives, have sharpened their criticism of the Fed in
recent weeks. Some members of the Republican-heavy ""Tea Party""
movement have pushed for abolishing the central bank.
 It was not clear whether either the House or Senate would
actually move ahead with a bill to do away with the dual
mandate. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said voting
on the mandate was ""just one of many issues we'll be working
with and thinking about in the coming weeks.""

(Updates prices, adds comment)
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Nov 16 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a seven-week
low against the dollar on Tuesday amid heightened worries about
a deepening euro zone debt crisis with losses accelerating
after breaking key support levels.
 The dollar rose broadly, climbing to a seven-week peak
versus a basket of currencies as sharply lower stock and
commodities prices boosted the greenback's safe-haven allure.
The stronger dollar also prompted investors to unwind bets
against the U.S. currency built up in recent months.
 The euro dipped below $1.35 after taking out options
barriers and support in the $1.3550 area. The single currency
will likely stay weak in the near term as investors focus on
debt troubles in Ireland and other European economies.
 European officials are weighing a rescue package of 80
billion to 100 billion euros for Ireland and a separate,
smaller bailout for its hard-pressed banking sector, the Wall
Street Journal reported on Tuesday.
 Ireland has come under intense pressure over its debt
crunch, with a top European Union official saying the future of
the 27-country union was at stake.
 Adding to worries was news that Greece will mostly probably
miss its fiscal targets this year and next and Austria has not
yet submitted its contribution to the aid package for Greece
for December. An official from Austria said it's not seeking to
block aid for Greece.
 ""What's the driving the euro is just all the sovereign risk
out of Europe,"" said Jack Iles, a portfolio manager at MFC
Global Investment Management in Boston. ""That's driving
sentiment across the board for risk assets and that probably
will not go away in the next 48 hours.""
 The euro last traded down 0.6 percent at $1.3498, after
hitting a session low of $1.3491 on trading platform EBS, its
weakest since Sept. 28.
 Downside targets include $1.3463, a 50 percent retracement
of the euro's September-November rally, and $1.3364, a 38.2
percent retracement of its June-November rally.
 Kathy Lien, director of research at GFT in New York, said
an agreement on a bailout for Ireland would be bearish for the
euro.
 ""On the day news of a Greek bailout emerged, the euro fell
about 100 pips and went on to fall further in the weeks that
followed. I don't see any solid support in the euro until
$1.34,"" she said.
 RISKIER CURRENCIES FALL
 Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed
currency speculators cut long euro positions significantly in
the latest week as they continued to trim bets against the
dollar.
 Traders said leveraged funds had flipped long euro/dollar
positions, suggesting year-end position adjustment may favor
the dollar.
 The euro gained in earlier trading after a survey by the
ZEW think-tank showed German analyst and investor sentiment
rose more than expected in November.
 The dollar index, which measures the dollar against a
basket of currencies, gained 0.9 percent to 79.201, after
hitting a high of 79.246, its strongest since Sept. 28.
 The dollar hit a six-week high of 83.51 yen, buoyed by a
recent rise in U.S. bond yields It broke through resistance on
daily Ichimoku charts at 83.17 yen, the bottom of the cloud.
The top of the cloud was at 84.13.
 Sterling fell 1.1 percent to $1.4893 after Bank of England
Governor Mervyn King said the central bank could do further
quantitative easing if that turns out to be necessary.""
 A broad pullback in risk appetite hit higher-yielding,
commodity-linked currencies. The U.S. dollar jumped 1.4 percent
against the Canadian dollar, while the Australian dollar fell
to its lowest in over two weeks at $0.9727 amid fears the China
will tighten monetary policy.

 * Ministers stop short of threatening WTO action
 * Indonesia says smallholding farmers will be hit first
 
 By Pete Harrison
 BRUSSELS, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Indonesia and Malaysia warned
on Tuesday that new European rules to ensure the sustainability
of biofuels might hamper their exports of palm oil and breach
rules on free trade.
But they stopped short of threatening action at the World
Trade Organization and said they would monitor the situation.
 The European Union's energy chief, Guenther Oettinger, set
green standards for biofuels in June to discourage companies
from felling forests to grow profitable biodiesel or bioethanol
crops.
 ""This directive discriminates (against) palm oil producers
compared with other competing oil crops used as feedstock for
biofuel production,"" Malaysian commodities minister Bernard
Dompok and Indonesian deputy agriculture minister Bayu
Krisnamurthi said in a joint statement.
 ""This directive has set criteria ... which could form a
non-tariff barrier for the imports of palm oil into the European
Union,"" they added during a visit to lobby EU officials.
 The EU wants to obtain 10 percent of its road fuels from
renewable sources by 2020, about 90 percent of which is seen
coming from crops such as grains, palms or sugar cane.
 Within the next decade that could create a market worth $17
billion, and critics say that creates an incentive for farmers
to hack into forests.
 The new sustainability standards state that biofuels used to
meet EU targets must save at least 35 percent of greenhouse
gases compared with oil and cannot come from recently cleared
land.
 EU experts are also examining a new scientific perspective
known as ""indirect land use change"", which suggests that even
biofuels grown on established agricultural land can have
widespread negative impact by forcing food production into new
areas.
 Krisnamurthi told reporters on Monday that although about
3-4 percent of plantations had been developed unsustainably, the
greenhouse gas savings from Indonesian palm oil were generally
much higher than envisaged in the EU rules. He urged a review.
 ""The first casualties will be the smallholding farmers,"" he
added. ""The big companies will have the energy and capability to
meet the requirements.""

(Adds Ireland to make statement, Rehn, Stark comments)
 By Jan Strupczewski and Julien Toyer
 BRUSSELS, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Ireland came under intense
pressure on Tuesday to request aid over its debt crunch in what
a top EU official called a ""survival crisis"" for the euro zone
and the wider European Union.
 As finance ministers of the 16-nation single currency area
gathered in Brussels, Dublin was still resisting calls to seek a
state bailout and insisting that only its banks may need help.
 But the government was to make a statement to parliament at
1700 GMT, an hour after the euro zone meeting starts.
 European Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said the EU
executive, the European Central Bank and the International
Monetary Fund were all working on ways ""to resolve the problems
of the Irish banking sector"".
 However, European partners made clear ahead of the talks
that loans from EU emergency funds could only be granted to a
government that signs a formal austerity programme on conditions
set and enforced by the European Commission and the IMF.
 European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, who chairs EU
summits, told a Brussels think-tank the future of the 27-nation
union was at stake in the latest spasm of a debt crisis that
began a year ago with Greece.
 ""We are in a survival crisis,"" he told the European Policy
Centre. ""We all have to work together in order to survive with
the euro zone because if we don't survive with the euro zone, we
will not survive with the European Union.""
 In an apparent rebuke to Van Rompuy, Rehn cautioned against
alarmism, saying: ""It's not a matter of the survival of the
euro.""
 The European Central Bank and some euro zone peers want
Dublin to take a quick decision on applying for aid amid signs
that market contagion is spreading to fellow struggler Portugal
and beginning to hurt Spain.
 Failure to reach agreement at the talks, which widen to all
EU finance ministers on Wednesday, could make markets even more
jittery and push borrowing costs still higher for Ireland and
other countries on the euro zone's periphery.
 Eager to save face and protect a slim parliamentary
majority, the Irish government has sought support for its banks,
which were driven to the brink by the global financial crisis
and a property market crash, without a formal state bailout.
 ""There is no reason why we should trigger an IMF or an
EU-type bailout,"" Ireland's European affairs minister, Dick
Roche, told BBC Radio.
 But the Irish opposition said moves were already under way.
 
 CONDITIONS
 In an indication of the sort of terms Brussels may be under
pressure to set, a senior German lawmaker said Ireland should
raise its ultra-low 12.5 percent corporation tax rate, a magnet
for foreign investment, to help cut its debt.
 Higher-tax countries have long seen the Irish rate as a form
of unfair competition, especially since Dublin was until the
mid-2000s one of the biggest recipients of EU regional aid.
 One euro zone source said Finland was against putting
pressure on Ireland to apply for a bailout quickly, saying EU
financial aid must be a last resort.
 Ireland's public borrowing needs are funded until mid-2011,
but its bond yields have soared in the past week and its
state-guaranteed banks are largely shut out of private sector
interbank lending and reliant on the ECB for funds.
 This has helped push up the borrowing costs of other
countries on the euro zone's periphery, such as Spain and
Portugal. Spanish short-term debt financing costs jumped at an
auction of 12- and 18-month treasury bills on Tuesday.
 Spanish Treasury Secretary Carlos Ocana pressed Ireland to
come to a resolution quickly to end market uncertainties. ""The
important thing is that Ireland makes a decision as soon as
possible,"" he told reporters in Madrid.
 ECB executive board member Juergen Stark said the central
bank would press on with scaling back lending support to banks
in the new year in a move bound to increase pressure on Irish
and Portuguese banks.
 The Irish coalition government has been reluctant to apply a
politically embarrassing bailout, partly because it faces a
by-election it can ill afford to lose on Nov. 25 and also
because it wants to preserve its sovereignty.
 
 SPILLOVER
 In Washington, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said
Europe was capable of dealing with the debt crisis but needed to
act ""very, very quickly"" to combine temporary financial support
with reforms that resolve underlying problems.
 His remarks appeared to reflect U.S. concern that, if left
to fester, they could spread and imperil global recovery.
 The risk premium investors charge for holding Irish 10-year
bonds rather than benchmark German Bunds widened to 579 basis
points and the cost of insuring Irish, Portuguese and Greek debt
against default edged up as peripheral euro zone bonds remained
under stress ahead of the Brussels meeting.
 European Central Bank Vice-President Vitor Constancio said
that if Ireland decided to request aid, which it had not yet
done, it would not necessarily force other countries, such as
his native Portugal, to follow suit.
 The ministers were also expected to discuss a future euro
zone crisis resolution mechanism, which Germany wants to start
from 2013, replacing the 440-billion-euro European Financial
Stability Facility set up after Greece sought help.
 Ireland and Greece says Germany has aggravated problems by
pushing the idea of asset value reductions or ""haircuts"" for
private bondholders under the planned permanent rescue
mechanism, raising the spectre of potential defaults.
 EU sources say possible aid under discussion for Ireland
ranges from 45 billion to 90 billion euros ($63-123 billion),
depending on whether Dublin needs support for its banks.

 * Auto slowdown drags down manufacturing sales
 * Top executives less optimistic, survey shows
 * Economic growth seen slowing further in third quarter
 By Louise Egan
 OTTAWA, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Canadian manufacturing sales
slumped in September, as expected, pressured by weak auto
production, a strong currency and sagging exports, which are
all putting the brakes on economic growth.
 Factory sales slipped 0.6 percent in the month, according
to Statistics Canada's monthly survey of manufacturing sales,
released on Tuesday. Markets had expected a 0.8 percent drop.
 A slowdown in auto production dragged down overall sales,
which was partially offset by volume and price gains in
petroleum and coal products and primary metals.
 ""This was undoubtedly a negative report for the
manufacturing sector. However, this was to be expected, given
the elevated level of the Canadian dollar, weak U.S. demand,
and the moderating domestic economy,"" said Francis Fong, an
economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank.
 Sales volumes were down 1.4 percent. But the drop followed
a 2 percent jump in August, the fastest growth rate in over a
year. Factory sales were up 9.1 percent from a year earlier and
were 17.7 percent above the recent low in May 2009. 
 The Canadian dollar, which had hit a two-week low against
the U.S. dollar prior to the data, extended its slide to
C$1.0181, or 98.23 U.S. cents, at 10:15 a.m. (1415 GMT).
 The soft factory data supports the view that growth slowed
in the third quarter from the 2 percent annualized pace in the
second quarter.
 Economists said that, after adjusting for inflation, sales
slowed to 3.3 percent in the third quarter from 8.9 percent in
the second quarter.
 The Bank of Canada is expected to keep its benchmark
interest rate steady at 1 percent in December and through early
2011, analysts said.
 OPTIMISM WEAKENS
 The worsening outlook was also reflected in a survey of top
business executives, which revealed a sharp drop in optimism
about prospects for the economy over the next year.
 Only 39 percent were optimistic in the third quarter, down
from 57 percent in the second quarter, according to the survey
by the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants and The
Royal Bank of Canada.
 They were more upbeat about their own individual companies,
with 58 percent expecting their business to grow faster than
the economy.
 Within the manufacturing sector, Statscan said automakers
registered the biggest decline in the month, with sales falling
10.4 percent due to slower production at several plants.
 Excluding autos and parts, factory sales eked out a 0.6
percent gain.
 Motor vehicles were also to blame for the 4.9 percent slide
in new orders in September. Unfilled orders slipped 1.9 percent
and inventories edged down 0.2 percent in the month.
 The inventory-to-sales ratio, a measure of how long it
would take to sell existing stock at the current pace of sales,
was unchanged at 1.34.

(Adds details, comment, byline)
 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Foreigners retained a healthy
appetite for U.S. government debt in September and were also
net buyers of short-term securities such as Treasury bills, the
U.S. Treasury Department said on Tuesday.
 Overall net inflows into the United States, including
short-term instruments, rose to $81.7 billion, compared to a
downwardly revised $11.2 billion inflow in August.
 Net long-term inflows fell to $81 billion from $128.7
billion, with Treasury debt attracting the most interest.
Foreigners bought a net $78.3 billion in Treasuries, below
August's $117.1 billion inflow but still the third highest
monthly total this year.
 Treasury yields fell in September after the Federal Reserve
hinted that it was ready to pump more money into the economy
through direct purchases of longer-dated Treasury debt. It made
good on its promise this month, pledging to spend $600 billion
by the middle of next year.
 ""I was impressed with the foreign demand for Treasuries,
which remained very strong despite strong demand the prior
month,"" said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at
BNY Mellon in New York. ""We expected some comeuppance but
didn't get it.""
 CENTRAL BANKS BIG BUYERS
 Demand was almost evenly split between private investors
and foreign central banks, though the latter group's $39.5
billion in net purchases was a record, Treasury said.
 That, Woolfolk said, was the ""dark side"" of the report, as
it reflected foreign central banks' efforts to limit local
currency appreciation by buying dollars and recycling them into
U.S. Treasury debt.
 China, the No. 1 holder of Treasuries, increased purchases
by $15.1 billion to $883.5 billion, while Japan bought a net
$28.4 billion of Treasuries in September, bringing its total
holdings to $865 billion.
 ""We do like to see foreign demand for our securities and
bonds, but ideally we'd like to see it coming from private
sources rather than official sources,"" Woolfolk said.
 Governments have clashed over exchange rates and unbalanced
global growth this year. The United States has urged China to
intervene less and allow faster currency appreciation, while
Beijing and other developing countries claim loose U.S.
monetary policy is stoking inflation beyond U.S. borders.
 ""There has been a great outcry that the Fed's signaling of
quantitative easing last August triggered large capital
outflows from the United States, driving the dollar down and
overwhelming emerging market countries, forcing them to erect
capital controls,"" Brown Brothers Harriman strategist Marc
Chandler said in New York. ""The Treasury data does not confirm
that.""
 In the year to September, though, China's Treasury holdings
have dipped about 5.8 percent, while Japan's holdings rose 15.7
percent. Chinese officials have expressed interest in
diversifying some of the country's $2.65 trillion reserves into
the euro, yen and other currencies.

 EQUITY DEMAND REBOUNDS
 Unlike official investors, private foreign accounts were
net buyers of U.S. equities in September to the tune of $21.5
billion, well above a $4.5 billion inflow in August. Total net
equity purchases amounted to $20.7 billion, as official buyers
were marginal net sellers of stocks.
 Foreign demand for U.S. corporate debt fell sharply, with
net inflows amounting to just $578 million, down from $10
billion the prior month.
 The United States saw a net outflow of $8.2 billion from
securities issued or guaranteed by the biggest U.S. mortgage
financing agencies.
 But analysts noted that the country attracted a modest net
inflow into short-term instruments such as Treasury bills and
deposits. Those are securities that have tended to show
outflows in recent months, as investors shun near-zero U.S.
short-term interest rates in favor of higher returns abroad.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Nov 16 (Reuters) - The euro came off a near
seven-week low against the dollar on Tuesday after
stronger-than-expected German economic data and as investors
waited to see whether euro zone ministers could agree on a
solution to Ireland's debt crisis.
 The euro stabilized around $1.36 after finding support at
its overnight low at $1.3560. The single currency may see a
reprieve if the finance ministers meeting in Brussels reach a
deal, which would ease concern that Irish debt woes could
spread to other economies such as Portugal and Spain.
Also, the euro gained after a survey by think tank ZEW
showed German analyst and investor sentiment rose more than
expected in November. For details, see [ID:nDEP003399]
 But any rebound for the euro, which has sold off in recent
days on anxiety over Irish finances, will likely be limited
with investors mindful of the severity of the debt problems
facing the euro zone's peripheral economies.
 ""For the short term, the developments in Europe,
specifically regarding bailout or no bailout of Ireland, is
dominating headlines,"" said Matthew Strauss, senior currency
strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
 The euro  was last 0.1 percent higher at $1.3596, off
a session low of $1.3560 set on trading platform EBS, its
weakest since late September. That took it below its 55-day
moving average, now at $1.3567.

currency strategy at CIBC.
 Downside targets include $1.3463, a 50 percent retracement
of the euro's September-November rally, and $1.3364, a 38.2

 By Steven Scheer
 JERUSALEM, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Israel's economy grew for a
sixth straight quarter in the July-September period, but falling
exports stemming from weak U.S. and European economies slowed
the rate and are expected to dampen growth into 2011.
 Gross domestic product  grew an annualised 3.8
percent in the third quarter, the Central Bureau of Statistics
said in an initial estimate on Tuesday. A Reuters survey of nine
analysts had forecast a 3.2 percent increase.
 Growth slowed from a 4.5 percent pace in the second quarter
but the economy has expanded at least 3.6 percent in every
three-month period since the third quarter of 2009, as Israel
rebouned from a brief recession in the wake of the global
financial crisis.
 The Bank of Israel forecasts 4 percent growth in 2010,
easing to 3.8 percent in 2011. The economy grew 0.8 percent to
768 billion shekels ($209 billion) in 2009.
 ""The economy is very robust. We are seeing a rapid growth
rate and other drivers are making up for the drop in exports, so
the total economy is in pretty good shape,"" said HSBC economist
Jonathan Katz. ""Because of the soft global environment, growth
may come down a notch (in 2011) to 3.4 percent."" 
 Some analysts believe the data support another short-term
interest rate increase later this month. Strong growth and high
inflation expectations have already led to six, quarter-point
rate increases to 2 percent since August 2009.
 The shekel  gained to 3.665 per dollar after the data
were released from 3.68 earlier, while Tel Aviv stocks <.TA100>
recovered from declines of 0.8 percent to a drop of 0.1 percent.
 
 EXPORTS
 Israel's two main growth drivers -- exports and consumer
spending -- were weak in the third quarter and resulted in a
slowdown from the previous quarter. However, a jump in
government spending and in investments softened the blow.
 ""The composition of growth was disappointing. Private
consumption was very weak, exports and imports declined sharply
and most of the contribution to growth came from public
consumption, from investment in residential construction and
from the activity of start-up companies,"" said Michael Sarel,
head of economic research at Harel Finance.
 Consumer spending slowed to a growth rate of 1.3 percent,
mainly due to a large decline in spending on durable goods,
while exports fell 9.6 percent.
 Exports -- which comprise more than 40 percent of Israel's
economic activity -- grew sharply in the prior four quarters but
slipped in the third quarter due to weak U.S. and European
economies, which account for some 70 percent of Israeli exports.
 
 Imports dipped 4.6 percent for the first decline since the
first quarter of 2009.
 Government spending rose 10.2 percent after marginal gains
in the prior two quarters and investment in fixed assets
increased 9.7 percent to continue strong gains this year
following a weak 2009.
 ""The composition of the data shows the start of a process
moving to growth based on domestic demand compared with early
stages of exiting the recession that was based on higher
exports,"" said Rafi Gozlan, an economist at Leader Capital
Markets.
 Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer believes the country
needs to base its economy more on domestic activity than
exports. He has urged exporters to expand sales to faster
growing markets in Asia, Latin America and Africa. 
 Excluding state spending, Israel's economy grew 3.9 percent
in the third quarter, slower than a 5.1 percent pace in the
second quarter.
 Second-quarter GDP growth was unrevised at 4.5 percent.

 By Jan Strupczewski and Julien Toyer
 BRUSSELS, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Ireland came under intense
pressure on Tuesday to request aid over its debt crunch in what
the European Council's president called a ""survival crisis"" for
the euro zone and the wider European Union.
 Hours before a meeting of finance ministers of the 16-nation
single currency area, Dublin was resisting calls to seek a state
bailout and insisting that only its banks may need help.
 European partners made clear ahead of the talks that loans
from EU emergency funds could only be granted to governments
that sign a formal austerity programme on conditions set and
enforced by the European Commission and the IMF.
 European Council President Herman Van Rompuy told a Brussels
think-tank the future of the 27-nation EU was at stake in the
latest spasm of a debt crisis that began a year ago with Greece.
 ""We are in a survival crisis,"" he told the European Policy
Centre. ""We all have to work together in order to survive with
the euro zone because if we don't survive with the euro zone, we
will not survive with the European Union.""
 The European Central Bank and some euro zone peers want
Dublin to take a quick decision on applying for aid amid signs
that market contagion is spreading to fellow struggler Portugal
and beginning to hurt Spain.
 Failure to reach agreement at the talks, which are widened
to all EU finance ministers on Wednesday, could make markets
even more jittery and push borrowing costs still higher for
Ireland and other countries on the euro zone's periphery.
 Trying to protect a slim parliamentary majority, the Irish
government says it is talking to European partners about how to
provide stability for its banks, which were driven into debt by
the global financial crisis and a property market crash. But it
denies that a state rescue is needed.
 ""I would hope after the Ecofin meeting this afternoon and
tomorrow there would be more logic introduced into this,""
Ireland's European affairs minister, Dick Roche, told BBC Radio.
 ""There is no reason why we should trigger an IMF or an
EU-type bailout.""
 One euro zone source said Finland was against putting
pressure on Ireland to apply for a bailout quickly, saying EU
financial aid must be a last resort.
 But the Irish opposition said moves were already under way.
 
 CONDITIONS
 In an indication of the sort of terms Brussels may be under
pressure to set, a senior German lawmaker said Ireland should
raise its ultra-low 12.5 percent corporation tax rate, a magnet
for foreign investment, to help cut its debt.
 ""The Irish rates are below the European Union average,"" said
Michael Meister, finance expert in Chancellor Angela Merkel's
Christian Democratic party. ""I therefore see here at least a
possibility, given the high budget deficit, to improve revenues
without causing a negative impact on growth.""
 Higher-tax countries have long seen the Irish rate as a form
of unfair competition, especially since Dublin was until the
mid-2000s one of the biggest recipients of EU regional aid.
 Ireland's public borrowing needs are funded until mid-2011,
but its bond yields have soared in the past week and its
state-guaranteed banks are largely shut out of inter-bank
lending and reliant on the ECB for funds.
 This has helped push up the borrowing costs of other
countries on the euro zone's periphery, such as Spain and
Portugal. Spanish short-term debt financing costs jumped at an
auction of 12- and 18-month treasury bills on Tuesday.
 Spanish Treasury Secretary Carlos Ocana pressed Ireland to
come to a resolution quickly to end market uncertainties. ""The
important thing is that Ireland makes a decision as soon as
possible,"" he told reporters in Madrid.
 The Irish coalition government has been reluctant to apply
for politically embarrassing assistance, partly because it faces
a by-election it can ill afford to lose on Nov. 25 and also
because it wants to preserve its sovereignty.
 
 SPILLOVER
 The euro fell below $1.36 to trade close to its lowest in
nearly seven weeks due to worries about euro zone peripheral
debt problems.
 From Washington, U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul Geithner
weighed in, saying European leaders should move quickly to deal
with the crisis through policy reforms.
 The risk premium investors charge for holding Irish 10-year
bonds rather than benchmark German Bunds widened to 579 basis
points and the cost of insuring Irish, Portuguese and Greek debt
against default edged up as peripheral euro zone bonds remained
under stress ahead of the Brussels finance ministers' meeting,
which promises to be heated.
 European Central Bank Vice-President Vitor Constancio said
that if Ireland decided to request aid, which it had not yet
done, it would not necessarily force other countries, such as
his native Portugal, to follow suit.
 The ministers were also expected to discuss a future euro
zone crisis resolution mechanism, which Germany wants to start
from 2013, replacing the 440-billion-euro European Financial
Stability Facility set up after Greece sought help.
 Ireland and Greece says Germany has aggravated problems by
pushing the idea of asset value reductions or ""haircuts"" for
private bondholders under the planned permanent rescue
mechanism, raising the spectre of potential defaults.
 EU sources say possible aid under discussion for Ireland
ranges from 45 billion to 90 billion euros ($63-123 billion),
depending on whether Dublin needs support for its banks.

 LONDON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - The euro came off a near seven-
week low against the dollar on Tuesday, helped by above-forecast
German data, and as investors waited to see whether euro zone
ministers could agree a solution to Ireland's debt problems.
 Analysts said the euro may earn a reprieve if the finance
ministers meeting in Brussels reach a deal, which would temper
concerns the debt crisis could spread to Portugal and suck in
bigger states.

 Gains for the euro, which has been under pressure in recent

problems facing the euro zone's periphery.
 ""The worst case scenario is contagion risk and it might give

 But U.S. bond yields stayed close to a three-month high near

dollar assets and helping lift the dollar to a six-week high
against the low-yielding yen.
 The euro  was 0.2 percent higher at $1.3609, off an
earlier low of $1.3560, its weakest since late September. That
took it below its 55-day moving average, now at $1.3567, and the
top of the cloud on daily Ichimoku charts at $1.3565.

euro would stay weak as long as uncertainty remained over how
Ireland's debt problems would be resolved.

 By Mette Fraende
 COPENHAGEN, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Danish shipper Norden cut its
outlook for 2010 and said it expected to be hit by lower spot
market rates in the fourth quarter, sending its shares to a
four-month low on Tuesday.
 Operating profit was mainly hit by unsuccessful speculation
in the dry cargo spot market, with a significant number of
vessels performing so-called repositioning voyages.
 That meant vessels were sent on trips at unattractive
freight rates, in the hope of being positioned for better
contracts somewhere else in the world.
 Third-quarter operating profit rose 58 percent to $44.9
million, compared with a forecast for $53.1 million in a Reuters
poll.
 The dry bulk shipper said it now expected full-year 2010
EBITDA of $220-$250 million, having previously expected
$240-$270 million, and an operating profit of $210-240 million,
versus $225-255 million forecast in August.
 ""The third quarter was affected by deferrals. In the fourth
quarter, we will be hit by lower rates,"" Chief Executive Carsten
Mortensen said in the statement.
Norden shares fell 4.7 percent to 200 crowns at 1033 GMT,
underperforming a 0.6 percent fall in Copenhagen's benchmark
index, as the downgrade disappointed and took analysts by
surprise. The shares touched a nearly four-month low at 198
crowns per share earlier in the day.
 ""I did not expect that downgrade. I had thought they would
be able to up their expectations to the high end of the
interval. So that is clearly disappointing,"" said Jacob
Pedersen, analyst at Sydbank.
 ""We can probably expect a weaker market which will put
pressure on earnings. I fear a situation with significant
overcapacity, and that can put preassure on freight rates and
earnings,"" said Pedersen.
 
 SPECULATION FAILED
 Norden attributed the fall in third quarter operating
profits to a significant number of recently chartered dry cargo
vessels having performed repositioning voyages from Asia to the
Atlantic, it said in the statement.
 ""They have been active in the spot market and they have not
been doing a good job. That has hit dry bulk results and forced
them to downgrade their outlook,"" Jyske bank trader Martin Munk
said. 
 ""This is a surprise. We were hoping they were doing good in
the dry bulk area. The share reaction is fair,"" Munk said.
 In spite of its downgrade, Norden was in a financially
strong position, and ready for acquisitions, the chief executive
told Reuters.
 ""We do not have to ask any bank for permission to do
anything. We will of course carry out acquisitions when market
conditions are right. That is what it is about in a cyclical
sector,"" Mortensen said.
 He said the group expected an increase in full-year EBITDA
of 75-98 percent compared with 2009.
 ""Looking forward, we have covered 78 percent of the known
ship days in Dry Cargo in 2011 and 42 percent in 2012,"" he said.
 Norden's third-quarter sales rose to $496 million, against
$433 million forecast by analysts. Net profit rose to $52.3
million, in line with expectations.

will try to find a way out of Ireland's debt crisis on Tuesday,
with Dublin resisting calls to seek a state bailout by
contending that only its banks may need help.
 European partners made clear ahead of the evening talks that

 Portuguese Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos
told the Financial Times there was a high risk that his country

lumping Greece, Ireland and Portugal together.
 But he later told Reuters there were no plans for Lisbon to
request emergency foreign funding.

that if Ireland decided to request aid, which it had not yet

rather than German benchmarks widened to 575 basis points from
around 562 bps at Monday's settlement.
 The cost of insuring against debt default in Ireland,
Portugal and Greece crept higher. Ireland's five-year credit
default swaps rose 11 basis points to 508 bps, while those for
Portugal were up 10 bps to 422 bps.
 Irish stocks fell 0.8 percent, Spain's share benchmark shed
1.5 percent and the Thomson Reuters Peripheral Eurozone
Countries Index eased 1.4 percent.
 The euro was steady at $1.3585, erasing gains after a
stronger-than-expected reading of German ZEW institute's
economic sentiment index. Earlier in the day, the single
currency hit its weakest since late September.
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent versus a basket of currencies.

 
 STOCKS, COMMODITIES UNDER PRESSURE
 U.S. stock index futures dropped 0.6 to 0.7 percent and
Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 index eased 1.2 percent
 World equities measured by MSCI All-Country World Index
fell 0.5 percent, hitting a two-week low.
 In Asia, China's share benchmark lost 4 percent, its lowest
close in a month, on renewed talk of further policy tightening,
and Japan's Nikkei average fell 0.3 percent.
 Oil lost 1.3 percent to trade below $84 a barrel, and copper
dropped 1.6 percent, while safe-haven gold was steady at
$1,360.20 an ounce.
 Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields recovered and traded
at 2.9151 percent after hitting 2.97 percent, the highest level
in more than three months, on worries over the future of the
Federal Reserve's $600 billion bond programme.
 However, New York Fed President William Dudley defended the
U.S. central bank's controversial bond-buying plan and said
withdrawing the programme could take years.
 Credit Suisse private bank said in a note that any periphery
inspired sell-off in European equities offered a buying
opportunity for European export stocks.
 ""One silver lining in the previous bouts of Eurozone
specific volatility earlier this year was the strong performance
of Eurozone exporters in the context of a weaker euro,"" it said.
 ""In this respect, we believe that any euro zone indebtedness
related sell-off in broad equity markets should provide a good
buying opportunity for euro zone export related stocks.""

 By Luke Baker
 BRUSSELS, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Finland is against putting
pressure on Ireland to quickly apply for a European Union
bailout, saying EU financial aid must be a last resort.
 Euro zone finance ministers will discuss Ireland's debt
situation at a meeting on Tuesday amid reports some EU countries
are keen for Dublin to quickly tap EU emergency funds to calm
markets and stop debt concerns from spreading to other
countries, like Portugal.
 ""Finland strongly opposes the German position that the
mechanism should be used just to make the markets calm down,""
said one euro zone source familiar with Finland's position. ""The
mechanism wasn't created for that purpose.""
 Since decisions among finance ministers over activating the
European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), which Ireland may
need to access, have to be taken unanimously, Finland's view
counts as much as the other 15 members of the euro zone.
 Finland's staunch opposition to pushing Dublin into asking
for help is partly based on its belief that the rules must be
strictly adhered to but also out of domestic political concerns
-- there is an election in Finland next year and there is
popular opposition to more bailouts.
 ""Finland is already supporting Iceland, Latvia, Greece and,
who knows, possibly Ireland and others,"" said a Finnish EU
source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
 ""The government will be politically dead if we accept
something that is unacceptable to the average Finn. There is no
way of explaining it to the average Finn that we are paying all
this money but don't know when it's coming back.""
 As well as opposing Ireland getting quick access to the EFSF
-- the Irish government is fully funded until mid-2011 and does
not immediately need financing help -- Finland opposes Ireland
tapping the EFSF or other EU mechanisms to help its banks.
 One euro zone source said that if Ireland asked for help in
order to bail out its banks, then it should be forced to put up
collateral against any loans. 
 The source said Ireland's government had assets worth over
100 billion euros which could be securitised and used as
collateral against an EFSF loan if one was requested.
 Martti Salmi, a ministerial adviser to the Finnish finance
minister, said: ""The rules on these two aid systems -- the EFSF
and the EFSM -- are unambiguous, the country must commit to a
strict adjustment programme, which will remove the original
cause.""
 The European Financial Stability Mechanism, is a 60 billion
euro fund overseen by the European Commission that can also be
tapped to provide financial assistance to EU member states in
emergency conditions.
 Euro zone finance ministers are expected to begin their
meeting at 1600 GMT with Ireland the main point on the agenda,
but the situation in Portugal, Greece and Spain also under
discussion.

 By Timothy Heritage 
 BRUSSELS, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers
will try to find a way out of Ireland's debt crisis on Tuesday,
with Dublin resisting calls to seek a state bailout by
contending that only its banks may need help.
 Dublin is under pressure from the European Central Bank and
euro zone peers to take a quick decision on applying for aid
amid signs that market contagion is spreading to fellow
struggler Portugal and could infect bigger states.
 The Irish government, trying to protect a slim parliamentary
majority, says it is talking to European partners about how to
provide stability for its banks but denies that a state rescue
is needed to stop its problems spilling into other countries.
 ""I would hope after the Ecofin meeting this afternoon and
tomorrow there would be more logic introduced into this,""
Ireland's European affairs minister, Dick Roche, told BBC Radio.
 ""There is no reason why we should trigger an IMF or an
EU-type bailout.""
 Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean Claude-Juncker, who chairs
Tuesday's talks in Brussels, said Ireland was not even close to
asking for a Greek-style bailout, which would involve tough
austerity terms enforced by the European Commission and the IMF.
 But the Irish opposition said moves were already under way.
 Several governments, including Finland and France, argue
that Dublin cannot receive loans to shore up its banks from the
European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) or the smaller
European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM) without submitting
to a full EU/IMF adjustment programme, euro zone sources said.
 ""The rules on these two aid systems ... are unambiguous, the
country must commit to a strict adjustment programme, which will
remove the original cause,"" said Martti Salmi, an adviser to the
Finnish finance minister.
 Finland, which requires parliamentary approval to contribute
to an EFSF rescue, argues that Ireland can only request help if
its government is unable to raise money on capital markets, and
any European loan should be backed by collateral drawn from
healthy Irish bank assets, the sources said.
 
 FULLY FUNDED
 Ireland's public borrowing needs are funded until mid-2011,
but its bond yields have soared in the past week and its
state-guaranteed banks are largely shut out of inter-bank
lending and reliant on the ECB for funds.
 This has helped push up the borrowing costs of other
countries on the 16-country euro zone's periphery, such as Spain
and Portugal.
 Spanish Treasury Secretary Carlos Oacana pressed Ireland on
Tuesday to come to a resolution over its debt crisis quickly to
end market uncertainties.
 ""The important thing is that Ireland makes a decision as
soon as possible,"" Ocana told reporters in Madrid.
 The Irish coalition government has been reluctant to apply
for assistance, partly because it faces a by-election it can ill
afford to lose on Nov. 25 and also because it says it wants to
preserve its sovereignty.
 Dublin has hinted it may ask for funding to support its
banks, which were driven into debt by the global financial
crisis and a property market crash, rather than requesting a
politically embarrassing state bailout.
 
 SPILLOVER
 The cost of insuring Irish, Portuguese and Greek debt
against default edged up on Tuesday as peripheral euro zone
bonds remained under stress ahead of the Brussels finance
ministers' meeting, which promises to be heated.
 ""The market thinks there is going to be some sort of deal
and it's just a matter of time before it's announced,"" one
London trader said.
 He said the Irish/German 10-year bond yield spread would
tighten sharply if a deal were announced, but markets would then
turn their attention to other debt-laden states like Portugal.
 Portuguese Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos
told the Financial Times there was a high risk that his country
would have to seek international aid because markets were
lumping Greece, Ireland and Portugal together.
 But he later told Reuters there were no plans for Lisbon to
request emergency foreign funding.
 European Central Bank Vice-President Vitor Constancio said
that if Ireland decided to request aid, which it had not yet
done, it would not necessarily force other countries, such as
his native Portugal, to follow suit.
 At their monthly meeting, the euro zone finance ministers
are likely to praise Ireland's planned 2011 budget cuts, which
face a parliamentary vote of approval next month. They are
joined for talks on Wednesday by the other EU finance ministers.
 They are also expected to discuss the future euro zone
crisis resolution mechanism, which Germany wants to start from
2013, replacing the 440-billion-euro European Financial
Stability Facility set up after Greece sought help in May.
 EU sources say possible aid under discussion for Ireland
ranges from 45 billion to 90 billion euros ($63-123 billion),
depending on whether Dublin needs support for its banks.
 Ireland and Greece says Germany has aggravated problems by
pushing the idea of asset value reductions or ""haircuts"" for
private bondholders under the planned permanent rescue
mechanism, raising the spectre of potential defaults.
 ""Unless the EU changes track and agrees to make the EFSF
(rescue fund) permanent and the ECB steps up its purchases of
the hard-hit countries' government bonds, investors will believe
that default is inevitable and demand correspondingly punitive
interest rates,"" said Simon Tilford, chief economist at the
London-based Centre for European Reform.
 ""Contagion to other member-states will be all but
inevitable. If, and when, it reaches Spain, the crisis risks
spiralling out of control,"" he said.

 BRUSSELS, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers
will try to find a way out of Ireland's debt crisis on Tuesday
evening, with Dublin resisting calls to seek a state bailout by
contending that only its banks may need help.
 Dublin is under pressure from the European Central Bank and

 Bank of Spain Governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez urged
Dublin on Monday to do more to calm financial markets, telling

it's Ireland that should take the decision at the right moment.""

matters with partners ... how best to underpin financial and
banking stability within the euro area,"" Prime Minister Brian
Cowen told the national broadcaster RTE on Monday.
 If such high borrowing costs became the norm, it would be
hard for banks ""to function as engines of recovery,"" he said.
 
 SPILLOVER
 Bond markets held their breath on Tuesday, awaiting the euro
zone finance ministers' meeting -- it promises to be heated with
Spain and Portugal already pressing for some sort of action.
 ""The market thinks there is going to be some sort of deal
and it's just a matter of time before it's announced,"" one
London trader said.
 He said the Irish/German 10-year bond yield spread would

 Finnish Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen told newspaper
Ilta-Sanomat that Ireland's situation was ""very unstable"",
adding: ""Ireland has not asked for help and is trying to manage
on its own. I hope they will manage.""
 Economists say Cowen's government may be able to wait until
after the by-election to request help but Irish opposition
finance spokesman, Michael Noonan, said the BBC he believed
""European intervention (was) under way.""

 By Axel Bugge and Andrei Khalip
 LISBON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - A decision by Ireland to seek
foreign aid would sharply raise the pressure on Portugal to do
the same as the last of the euro zone's small and exposed
economies battles chronically low growth and a high deficit.
 Ireland's debt woes helped drive Portuguese risk premiums to
euro lifetime highs last week, and analysts say pressure will
intensify if Dublin does finally ask for emergency aid from the
European Union.
 While Portugal's debts and deficit are much lower than
Ireland's, and its banks have not suffered from the bursting of
a housing bubble, analysts stress Lisbon's inability to generate
strong growth since it joined the euro makes it vulnerable.
 Portugal's funding costs for now remain much lower than
Ireland's, reflecting Lisbon's stronger credentials -- its
budget deficit is expected at 7.3 percent of gross domestic
product this year compared with Dublin's 12 percent.
 But at roughly 6.8 percent, Portuguese 10-year yields are
still within sight of the 8-percent plus rates which economists
say will now likely tip the boat for Dublin.
 ""If Ireland goes (to seek aid), there will be pressure on
Portugal, although I'm not quite sure Ireland is going to seek
help,"" said Anke Richter, credit research director at Conduit
Capital Markets in London.
 Analysts point out that at least on the political front
Portugal has won time with an agreement last month between the
minority Socialist government and opposition Social Democrats to
pass an austere 2011 budget in parliament. The budget was passed
in its first reading in parliament on Nov. 3.
 Concern over the ability of the government to pass the
budget weighed on Portugal in October and threatened a political
crisis as the government rules without a majority in parliament.
 While short-term political concerns have subdued, Foreign
Minister Luis Amado warned this weekend that failure to form a
coalition government to overcome the crisis could push Portugal
out of the euro. [nLDE6AC05V].
 Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos said on Monday
there were no plans to seek foreign aid. [nLDE6AE1ZM]
 
 AUSTERITY COMING
 The government's budget, which includes 5 percent cuts to
civil servant wages and a rise in value-added tax to 23 percent
from 21 percent, should deliver a sharp fall in next year's
budget deficit to 4.6 percent of GDP.
 But the key question, analysts say, is how Portugal can grow
in coming years with increasing austerity. Unlike the other
peripheral euro zone economies in the run up to the financial
crisis, Portugal has had one of the EU's lowest growth rates.
 ""Ireland is close to the point of no return and Portugal is,
after Ireland and Greece, the third country in the euro zone
with the most problems, essentially due to its foreign debt,""
said Rui Barbara, an economist at Carregosa Bank.
 ""With debts as high as ours, as much as the government cuts
its expenses, the more important question is growth,"" he said,
adding that if bond yields remain above 6 percent until the end
of this year it would be hard for Portugal not to seek EU aid.
 Portugal's government debt is around 82 percent of gross
domestic product, much below Greece's 130 percent and Ireland's
near 100 percent, but analysts say that adding corporate and
private debt burden, the total rises to an alarming rate over
250 percent. 
 This may prove to be an additional strain on Portuguese
banks that have relied heavily on ECB loans of late -- another
similarity to Ireland.
 Economic growth this year has so far surprised on the
upside, with an expansion of 1.5 percent in the third quarter
from a year earlier.
 But with Portugal now enacting tough austerity, many
economists think the country will slide back into recession next
year. The government projects growth of 0.2 percent in 2011, a
projection many economists say is overly-optimistic.
 ""You can have the toughest budget, but if you can't get the
economy growing you can't really tackle your debt,"" said
Richter.
 In a research report titled 'Is Portugal Next?', UBS said
the pressure on both Portugal and Ireland to seek external
support is increasing.
 ""Although the move of (Portuguese) spreads has been less
extreme than in the case of Ireland, the situation is arguably
not much better,"" UBS said.
 
 DIFFERENCES
 Still, other economists say there are big differences
between Portugal and Ireland which markets are not sufficiently
reflecting.
 Peter Nabney, ING country manager for Portugal, wrote in the
Financial Times on Friday that Ireland's troubles stem from the
Irish banking sector's lending to the property sector and the
subsequent bust in housing.
 ""Portugal's plight is a creeping loss of competitiveness,
but as this has evolved against a backdrop of sluggish economic
growth, the country's institutions remain sound,"" Nabney wrote.
 Portugal joined the euro at what many see as an overinflated
rate that undermined local business for the longer-term. Some
economists suggest average wages in Portugal have to be cut by
10 percent for the economy to regain competitiveness.
 But the simple association of Portugal with the other
peripheral euro zone countries is making it increasingly tough
for the Iberian country to distance itself from them.
 ING's Nabney said he fails to see the similarities between
Ireland and Portugal.
 ""However, as we know too well, if Ireland has to request
support the market will move on to the next vulnerable victim, a
process that has already begun,"" he wrote.

 * Previous day's jump in Treasury yields supports dollar
 * But comments from Fed's Dudley see it lose a bit of ground
 * Still, greenback above 55-day MA vs yen and Swiss franc
 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - The dollar touched a six-week high
against the euro on Tuesday, supported by a rise in U.S.
Treasury yields, but later retreated as officials from the
Federal Reserve sounded a dovish tone and defended its easing
policy.
 The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield jumped about 17 basis points
on Monday and hit a three-month high near 2.97 percent, helping
give a broad lift to the greenback.
 The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against
a basket of currencies, hit a six-week high of 78.744 earlier
and the euro, also pressured by concerns over euro zone debt,
touched a six-week trough of $1.3560.
 But the euro later recovered some ground to $1.3612, rising
0.2 percent on the day, as New York Fed President William Dudley
said the need to exit from current policies could be ""years
away"", following up dovish remarks from Fed vice chairwoman
Janet Yellen.
 Their comments may have been aimed at tempering the recent
rise in Treasury yields, as well as countering criticism of the
quantitative easing policy, said Koji Fukaya, chief currency
strategist at Credit Suisse in Tokyo.
 ""It would be problematic if long-term interest rates rise
and equities pull back,"" he said.
 ""Whether it was the depth or the speed of the correction,
the aim is probably to calm that down a bit.""
 The euro bounced back after dipping to just below its 55-day
moving average, now at $1.3567, and the top of the cloud on
daily ichimoku charts at $1.3565.
 A trader for a major Japanese bank said it was also
supported by talk of buying on dips by Asian players and after
its drop stalled right near those support levels.
 But it remains vulnerable due to the potential for more
short-covering in the dollar as the year-end approaches and as
uncertainty persists over whether Ireland will go for a state
bailout.
 Downside targets include $1.3463, a 50 percent retracement
of the euro's September-November rally, and $1.3364, a 38.2
percent retracement of its June-November rally.
 With worries about fiscal troubles in Ireland and Portugal,
the market will watch meetings of European finance officials on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
 Euro zone finance ministers will try to find a way to end
Ireland's debt crisis, with Dublin resisting pressure to seek a
state bailout by signalling that only its banks may need help.
 ""The longer it drags on, the longer we grind down,"" said
Robert Ryan, FX strategist at BNP Paribas.
 The dollar slipped 0.2 percent to 82.93 after touching a
six-week high of 83.28 yen on Monday.
 Its 55-day moving average against the yen now lies at 82.83
yen, offering support. It faces resistance on daily ichimoku
charts at 83.17 yen, the bottom of the cloud, and then at the
top of the cloud at 84.13 yen.
 The dollar's fate has had a close correlation to U.S. yields
and their gap with rates on other currencies, as increases in
U.S. yields -- other things being equal -- tend to help the
greenback by making dollar investments more attractive.
 That yield gap has recently moved in the dollar's favour as
a result of the sell-off in Treasuries. The yield gap of 10-year
U.S. Treasuries over 10-year JGBs is now almost 190 basis
points, up from about 164 basis points last Thursday..
 The sell-off in Treasuries and short-covering in the dollar,
after weeks of dollar selling in anticipation of more QE from
the Fed, has gained steam ahead of next week's U.S. Thanksgiving
holiday.
 The fact that now is right around the 45-day advance notice
deadline thought to be used by some hedge funds for investors to
seek fund redemptions by the year-end has likely exacerbated
such moves as well, traders say.
 They don't rule out more dollar short-covering as investors
close their books for the year, with the euro and popular
high-yielder the Australian dollar seen as likely targets.

 * Inflation is seen as biggest risk now in China
 * Central bank governor says economy on solid footing

 By Kevin Yao and Aileen Wang
 BEIJING, Nov 16 (Reuters) - China will unveil food price
controls and crack down on speculation in agricultural
commodities to contain inflationary pressure that its central
bank governor highlighted as a risk on Tuesday.
 With consumer prices rising at their fastest pace in more
than two years, the National Development and Reform Commission,
the country's top planning agency, is preparing a ""one-two
punch"" of actions to rein in food costs, official media
reported.
 Such direct intervention would mark an escalation of the
government's efforts to tame inflation and underline its
worries over the rapid run-up in food prices.
 Possible steps include price controls, subsidies for
shoppers, a crackdown on hoarding and price gouging as well as
a system whereby mayors are made responsible for a basket of
food items, the China Securities Journal reported.
 Those found speculating on corn or cotton will also be
punished severely, it added.
 ""Price increases, particularly overly rapid food price
increases, are the main economic problem faced by the country
at present,"" the report cited an unidentified source as saying.
 ""The policies that are being considered aim to contain the
momentum and will be delivered in combination as a one-two
punch,"" it added.
 http://link.reuters.com/keh65q

Consumer price inflation sped to a 25-month high in October,
with prices rising 4.4 percent from a year earlier. Food, which
makes up about a third of China's consumer price index, led the
way, climbing 10.1 percent. Non-food items increased just 1.6
percent.
 However, unlike past bouts of food inflation in China,
there have been no major droughts or diseases to drive up
prices this year. Instead, fast money growth appears to be the
primary culprit.
 At a regular briefing on Tuesday, the commerce ministry
pointed its finger at factors beyond China's borders.
 ""Imported inflationary pressure has contributed to the big
rise in China's food prices. Global prices of grains, cotton
and edible oil have been rising noticeably,"" spokesman Yao Jian
said.
 China used food price controls to limited effect when
inflation flared up at the end of 2007. With market forces
dominant in the agricultural sector, the government struggles
to steer the cost of food, though the announcement of controls
can help to anchor inflationary expectations.
 WATCHING PRICES
 China's economy is growing in line with the government's
road map, but price rises are a concern, central bank chief
Zhou Xiaochuan said on Tuesday.
 ""Upward pressure on prices needs to be watched. We will
continue to maintain appropriate growth of money and credit,""
he said.
 Zhou said that a two-speed global recovery posed complex
challenges.
 ""Recovery in developed economies is slow. Monetary
conditions are loose,"" Zhou told a forum. ""Growth of emerging
market economies is accelerating but they face capital
inflows.""
 Chinese officials have warned that loose monetary policy in
developed economies -- and, in particular, a new round of
quantitative easing in the United States -- could send waves of
cash towards its borders, compounding its inflationary problem.
 Although China has a comprehensive system of capital
controls, hot money can still work its way into the country
through normal trade and investment channels.
 Yao, the commerce ministry spokesman, warned that Beijing
would ferret out any speculative inflows disguised as foreign
direct investment.
 Judging by the numbers, though, there is little evidence so
far of that kind of illicit investment.
 China drew $7.7 billion of foreign direct investment in
October, about $500 million less than its monthly average in
the first three quarters. [ID:nBJA002342]

 * Inflation remains subdued for now
 * Hopes to boost inter-bank foreign exchange market
(Adds exchange rate system)
 By Kezio-Musoke David
 KIGALI, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Rwanda's central bank cut its
key repo rate by one percentage point to 6.0 percent, the
second reduction this year designed to stimulate lending to the
private sector, according to a statement on Tuesday.
 The bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it planned
to keep the lending rate on hold through the first quarter of
2011, when inflation rates in the central African country were
likely to start picking up.
 ""One of the policies to encourage the increase of bank
loans to private sector is to reduce incentives for banks to
invest in the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) and in government
instruments by lowering the Key Repo Rate (KRR),"" said the MPC
statement.
 ""Consequently, the Monetary Policy Committee decided to
reduce the KRR by 1 percentage point, from its current level of
7 percent to 6 percent, to be in force during the remaining
part of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011,"" it said.
 The central bank last cut the repo rate in March when it
shaved off 50 basis points, saying it wanted to speed up the
slow recovery.
 IMPROVING MARKET EFFICIENCY
 The bank also said it was eliminating the average reference
rate for the Rwandan franc -- currently used as its rate for
customers -- and unifying the market rate with its customer
rate to boost the inter-bank foreign exchange market.
 ""NBR will operate with new buying and selling customer
rates established as margins on either side of the previous
day's closing market rate,"" the statement said.
 ""It is expected that this change will help in stimulating
inter-bank foreign exchange market and improving market
efficiency,"" it said.
 Like other countries in the region, Rwanda's growth rates
slowed in 2009 as the global economic slowdown hit industry and
services. But the country's recovery has picked up in 2010.
 Rwanda's economy expanded 9.4 percent in the second
quarter, the fastest quarterly growth rate since the first
three months of 2009, while inflation has remained subdued.
 In each of the past four months, the consumer price index
for all of Rwanda's urban and rural areas has fallen from the
same period a year earlier. In October, prices were 2.28
percent lower than the same month in 2009.
 In towns and cities, inflation has also been contained. The
urban consumer price index for October showed prices were just
0.17 percent higher than a year earlier.
 ""While inflation has remained low, estimated at 0.17
percent in October on annual basis, it is projected at 1.4
percent in December 2010 and 4.0 percent in March 2011,"" the
MPC said.
 Gross domestic product growth in 2010 is expected to be
about 7.2 percent after 6.1 percent expansion last year.

87,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2010 10:56PM ET</span>","IMF sets new SDR currency weights, no expansion"," WASHINGTON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The International Monetary
Fund on Monday altered the basket of currencies comprising the
IMF Special Drawing Right but did not open it to any new
currencies.
 The IMF shifted a little away from the U.S. dollar and the
Japanese yen  and gave more more weight to the euro
 and pound  in determining new currency weights for
the SDR, which has been mentioned as a potential future global
reserve currency.
 ""The value of the SDR will continue to be based on a
weighted average of the values of a basket of currencies
comprising the U.S. dollar, euro, pound sterling and Japanese
yen,"" the IMF said in a statement.
 There had been speculation that the IMF could expand the
SDR basket to include the Chinese yuan , in an
acknowledgment of China's rising clout in the global economy.
 In a review completed this month, the IMF concluded that
the SDR should be weighted at 41.9 percent U.S. dollar, 37.4
percent euro, 11.3 percent British pound and 9.4 percent
Japanese yen, the IMF said.
 In a review five years ago, the agency concluded that the
SDR would be weighted at 44 percent U.S. dollar, 34 percent
euro, 11 percent yen and 11 percent pound.
 The SDR, created by the IMF over 40 years ago to serve as
an international reserve asset, usually is reviewed every five
years. Its value is based on a basket of ""freely usable""
currencies.
 Discontent with a weakening U.S. dollar has sparked
interest in finding alternatives to supplant the greenback's
dominant role in the global economy, putting a fresh focus on
SDRs.
 China is now the world's second-largest economy, although
its currency is not convertible on the capital account and
therefore it is barely used outside China.

 * Previous day's jump in Treasury yields supports dollar
 * Dollar may rise further on year-end position unwinding
 * Greenback rises above 55-day MA vs yen and Swiss franc
 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - The dollar touched a six-week high
against the euro on Tuesday, extending gains after U.S. Treasury
yields jumped as investors closed out bets before market
liquidity declines towards the year-end.
 The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield jumped about 17 basis points
on Monday and hit a three-month high near 2.97 percent, helping
give a broad lift to the greenback.
 The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against a
basket of currencies, hit a six-week high of 78.743 earlier, and
the euro touched a six-week trough of $1.3560 on trading platform
EBS.
 Although the euro later trimmed its losses to stand at
$1.3610, up 0.2 percent from late U.S. trade on Monday, traders
said the euro looked vulnerable due to the potential for more
short-covering in the dollar as the year-end approaches.
 ""Currencies such as the euro and the Australian dollar are
likely to be sold while the dollar is bought back. That is the
type of move we could see as a part of position unwinding,"" said
a trader for a Japanese trust bank.
 The euro bounced back after dipping to just below its 55-day
moving average, now at $1.3567, and the top of the cloud on daily
ichimoku charts at $1.3565.
 A trader for a major Japanese bank said the euro was
supported by talk of buying on dips by Asian players. Traders may
also have bought the euro after its drop stalled right near those
support levels, he said.
 A clear breach of such support, however, could open the way
for a further decline in the euro.
 Potential downside targets include $1.3463, a 50 percent
retracement of the euro's September-November rally, and $1.3364,
a 38.2 percent retracement of its June-November rally.
 Market players were also keeping an eye on worries about
fiscal troubles in Ireland and Portugal and meetings of European
finance officials on Tuesday and Wednesday.
 The main focus in the near term, however, was on U.S. bond
yields and seasonal position unwinding, traders said.
 The recent sell-off in Treasuries and short-covering in the
dollar has gained steam ahead of next week's U.S. Thanksgiving
holiday.
 The fact that now is right around the 45-day advance notice
deadline thought to be used by some hedge funds for investors to
seek fund redemptions by the year-end has likely exacerbated such
moves as well, traders say.
 ""U.S. bonds were sold at a time when seasonal position
unwinding tends to appear and the dollar has been bought back,""
said a trader for a European bank in Tokyo.
 The dollar's fate has had a close correlation to U.S. yields
and their gap with rates on other currencies, as increases in
U.S. yields -- other things being equal -- tend to help the
greenback by making dollar investments more attractive.
 That yield gap has recently moved in the dollar's favour as a
result of the sell-off in Treasuries. The yield gap of 10-year
U.S. Treasuries over 10-year JGBs is now near 186 basis points,
up from about 164 basis points last Thursday..
 The dollar was steady against the yen at 83.08 yen, hovering
near a six-week high of 83.28 yen marked on trading platform EBS
on Monday.
 The dollar's 55-day moving average against the yen now lies
at 82.83 yen, offering support. It faces resistance on daily
ichimoku charts at 83.17 yen, the bottom of the cloud, and then
at the top of the cloud at 84.13 yen.
 Gains in the dollar could be limited during Asian trading,
since Japanese exporters seem likely to sell it, said the trader
for a European bank.

 * Strong global shares help but econ outlook, yen limit gains
 * 70 pct say Japan should lower econ dependence on China
 By Chikafumi Hodo and Mari Terawaki
 TOKYO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Japanese retail investors remained
pessimistic on domestic stocks as the country's economy stayed
moribund, although sentiment improved slightly for the second
consecutive month after an upturn in global shares, a Reuters
poll showed on Tuesday.
 A rise in global stocks after the Federal Reserve announced
additional monetary easing measures and slight falls in the yen
helped the key investor sentiment index inch up, but the extent
of the recovery was small as the yen stayed high and the outlook
for the export-led Japanese economy remained unclear.
 ""We simply can't be positive about the Japanese economy in a
situation where the yen is expected to remain bullish. This
should keep Japanese shares at low levels,"" said a pensioner in
his 60s.
 The Reuters sentiment index, calculated by subtracting the
percentage of investors who say they are bearish from those who
are bullish, rose four points to minus 60 in November after
improving six points the previous month.
 Still, the index stayed near an 18-month low of minus 70
marked in September.
 The Reuters survey of 482 Japanese individual investors was
conducted on Nov 4-7, during which the benchmark Nikkei average
jumped about 5 percent. The Fed announced a day before the survey
was conducted that it planned to buy $600 billion of government
bonds.
 The yen also drifted down against the dollar after the Fed
move, but the Japanese currency was still near its record high of
79.75 reached in April 1995.
 A few respondents said that Japanese stocks were undervalued.
""Japanese share prices are extremely undervalued on views that a
further strengthening of the yen would be unlikely from current
levels,"" said an investor in her 40s.
 Japan's gross domestic product grew 0.9 percent in
July-September from the previous quarter, accelerating from a 0.4
percent gain in the second quarter and beating a median forecast
for a 0.6 percent rise, Cabinet Office data showed on Monday.
 But many analysts expect the economy to stall, or even
contract slightly, in the next two quarters as the strong yen's
damage to exports becomes more evident.
 The poll showed that more than 70 percent of investors
believed that Japan should lower its economic dependence on
China, underscoring political tensions between the two countries
after the collision of a Chinese fishing boat and Japanese patrol
vessels off a disputed chain of islands.
 The survey showed that 14 percent of respondents said they
want to be aggressive about investing in China.
 But 38 percent of participants said they were not
enthusiastic, while 48 percent said they were not considering
investing in the country.

 * Nikkei reverses into losses after hitting five-month
peaks
 * Firm U.S. dollar drags on commodities
 By Koh Gui Qing
 SYDNEY, Nov 16 (Reuters) - The euro briefly hit six-week
lows against the dollar on Tuesday and Asian stocks slid as
concerns Ireland may not repay its debt encouraged investors to
take profits after a strong autumn rally.
 Another sharp sell-off in Chinese stocks in late trade also
unnerved some investors and led them to wonder if prices of
riskier assets were turning lower for good.
 The tepid mood in equity market spilled into Europe.
Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.7 percent and France's CAC 40 lost
0.8 percent.
 The Shanghai Composite Index slid 4.3 percent at one point
as investors, worried China may further tighten monetary
policy, sold blue-chip bank and energy shares.
 ""The swings in China are radical in the last few days,""
said Jackson Wong, an investment manager at Tanrich Securities
in Hong Kong. ""People are still trying to figure out if this is
the beginning of a downtrend.""
 The overall cautious tone kept the MSCI Asian stock index
outside Japan down 0.1 percent, an insignificant move compared
to its 16 percent jump since early September.
 Japan's Nikkei initially bucked the downdraft and rose to
five-month highs, but it too eventually succumbed to end down
0.3 percent.
 Uncertainty over whether Ireland, faced with record
borrowing costs, needs to be bailed out by its euro zone
partners to pay its debts also did little for the market mood.
 As it is, Ireland's woes have raised borrowing costs for
other fiscally strapped euro zone nations such as Spain and
Portugal. Euro zone officials are set to meet later to try to
find a way to end Ireland's debt crisis.
 The euro fell as far as $1.3560 at one point, but clawed
back by late trade after dovish remarks from a Federal Reserve
official nudged the dollar lower.
 But the dollar stayed firm on the day and depressed prices
of most commodities. Oil lost 0.8 percent to pull further away
from last week's 25-month highs.
 Yet, some analysts thought the latest pull-back in prices
had less to do with a reassesment of market risks, and more to
do with investors wanting to take profits and cut stretched
bets.
 ""The European markets could potentially cause contagion
pressures to erupt if people start liquidating. But
realistically the dynamic within Asia remains very strong,""
said Peter Redward, the head of emerging Asia research at
Barclays in Singapore.
 Underscoring Asia's sturdy economic growth, the South
Korean central bank raised interest rates on Tuesday and hinted
there could be more hikes to come.
 That Asia is tightening policy is a world away from the
United States, where a Fed official said on Tuesday an exit
from the present super-loose policy may be ""years away"".
 RISING US YIELDS
 For some, the recent creep up in U.S. Treasury yields is
among the more startling turn in the market as it could choke
off a recovery in the U.S. economy by raising borrowing costs.
 For now, analysts said the sell-off in Treasuries was
driven by profit-taking and uncertainty over whether the Fed
would ultimately buy the $600 billion worth of bonds it had
promised.
""Somewhere down the track, especially if the U.S. dollar
does continue to rise and U.S. yields do continue to back up,
the economic recovery may begin to stall again,"" said Greg
Gibbs, an analyst at RBS in Sydney.
 The 10-year Treasury yield, a benchmark for U.S. mortgages,
spiked 17 basis points on Monday, its biggest jump in any
single day since June 2009.
 It stood at 2.90 percent in late Asian trade. Some traders
expected it would eventually grind towards four-month highs of
3 percent.
 Rising U.S. yields bodes well for the U.S. dollar however,
as it reduces its allure as a funding currency for carry
trades.
 The yield gap of 10-year U.S. Treasuries over 10-year

 * Sees unemployment around 8 percent at end of 2012
(Adds more quotes from Yellen)
 By Jeff Mason and JoAnne Allen
 WASHINGTON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is not
trying to push down the value of the U.S. dollar or boost
inflation above 2 percent, the central bank's vice chairwoman
said, defending its program of massive new bond purchases.
 In an interview published on Monday in the Wall Street
Journal, Janet Yellen defended the Fed's decision this month to
purchase $600 billion more of U.S. Treasury bonds in a bid to
strengthen economic growth.
 ""The purpose of it is not to push down the dollar. This
should not be regarded as some sort of chapter in a currency
war,"" she told the newspaper.
 The Fed's action drew international criticism that the
central bank was trying to undermine the dollar to the
detriment of other nations. Domestically, some prominent
Republicans have also criticized the move.
 Yellen, who said she was not happy to see the Fed ""caught
up in a political debate,"" said the central bank decided to
take the controversial measures because of extremely high
unemployment, which could last a long time. Inflation, she
said, would stay at ""very low levels"" for some time.
 ""I don't think this is a panacea. But the question is: Do
we have an effective policy that we can adopt?"" she said. ""If
we do, and it actually produces expected benefits and addresses
risks that we face, then there is a clear case for doing it,
even if it is not going to be a panacea.""
 She said it was not fair to paint the Fed's bond purchase
program as a cause of capital flow problems in other
countries.
 DIFFICULT TERRAIN
 Yellen said the U.S. economy would continue to grow but it
would take a long time to get unemployment down from 9.6
percent to 8 percent.
 ""I'm having a hard time seeing where really robust growth
can come from. And I see inflation lingering around current
levels for a long time,"" she said.
 ""If you ask me to name an unemployment rate we'd see at the
end of 2012, it would probably be around 8 percent. I expect a
pickup in growth next year. I don't expect a double-dip
recession.""
 She forecast the economy would be back at 2 percent
inflation with unemployment beneath 7 percent in ""something
like 2013.""
 But she cautioned that growth could fall short of
forecasts, leading to higher joblessness.
 ""The economy also has real downside risk. It's conceivable
that growth could fall short of what we're expecting and
unemployment could start heading up further,"" she said.
 ""And if we really get a weak scenario with unwinding
confidence or, who knows, larger losses for financial
institutions, we could find ourselves with a downward dynamic
occurring that really takes us into very difficult terrain.""

* EU sources say aid could go beyond help for banks
* EU council president says euro zone in ""survival crisis""

(Adds details, sources on possible aid, economist comment)
 By Jan Strupczewski and Julien Toyer
 BRUSSELS, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers
agreed on Tuesday to lay the groundwork for a bailout of Ireland
with the IMF, but said Dublin must decide itself whether to
request the aid.
 The ministers said they had agreed the European Commission,
European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund would this
week start a mission to Ireland, whose debt crisis could
threaten other euro zone states and the euro area's stability.
 Before the ministers met in Brussels, Irish Prime Minister
Brian Cowen resisted pressure to request a state bailout but
indicated help may be needed for the banking sector, which is a
big factor in the country's huge budget deficit.
 Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker, who chaired
Tuesday's talks, vowed to defend the stability of the 16-nation
currency zone.
 ""The discussions that will take place between Ireland and
the Commission and the ECB and the IMF will enable us to have at
our disposal all the elements and instruments we need were
Ireland to make a request for assistance to the EU, the IMF and
the Eurogroup,"" he told a news conference after the talks.
 Euro zone sources said that although the mission would focus
mainly on helping the banking sector, there was an agreement in
principle to trigger aid for Ireland when the joint mission
completes its consultations -- perhaps in days -- and that the
aid would not be just a programme for the banks.
 ""I don't have an exact calendar because there are works
under way which are intensifying in a targeted and rapid way, to
explore the whole variety of necessary measures,"" French Economy
Minister Christine Lagarde said.
 ""If you ask me whether that is a question of six months or
of days, I would say we are closer to a question of days rather
than six months.""
 Concerns that Ireland's crisis could worsen and spread to
other countries have unsettled financial markets, and any
prolonged uncertainty could cause new jitters.
 ""There is an air of inevitability that there will be some
sort of bailout,"" said Alan McQuaid, chief economist at Bloxham
Stockbrokers. ""Why come to Dublin if you are not going to give a
bailout?""
 He said bond markets might respond positively to the euro
zone ministers' actions on Wednesday.
 ""But I am not convinced that even if we get a bailout the
euro zone thing (problems) will finish there. The markets are
smelling blood,"" he said. ""There are a lot of guys in the U.S.
who are worried that this is going to proceed into a full-blown
bond market crisis, it's going to start off in Dublin and end up
in Washington.""
 
 IRISH GOVERNMENT RESISTS PRESSURE
 Cowen said in Dublin the Irish government was fully funded
until mid-2011, and that only its banks may need help. He also
acknowledged the government was no closer to publishing a
four-year plan for tackling the budget deficit.
 Irish banks have grown increasingly reliant on funding from
the European Central Bank, as other commercial lenders have been
reluctant to lend to them following the financial crisis in
fellow euro zone member Greece.
 Bank of Ireland, the country's largest lender, signalled
last week it had suffered a 10 billion euro outflow of deposits
from early August until the end of September.
 Allied Irish Banks, which will be more than 90 percent owned
by the state following a rights issue later this year, will
issue a trading statement later this week with details about its
funding situation.
 The euro fell more than a cent to below $1.3450 and European
stocks shed 2.2 percent on the day as investors worried that the
euro zone ministers' meeting would not bring a solution to
Ireland's debt crunch.
 Some ministers said before the talks that loans from EU
emergency funds could only be granted to a government that
signed a formal austerity programme, with conditions set and
enforced by the European Commission and the IMF.
 European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said before
Tuesday's talks the future of the 27-nation Union was at stake
in the latest spasm of a debt crisis that began a year ago with
Greece, which secured an EU/IMF bailout.
 ""We are in a survival crisis,"" he said. ""We all have to work
together in order to survive with the euro zone because if we
don't survive with the euro zone, we will not survive with the
European Union.""
 EU sources say possible aid under discussion for Ireland
ranges from 45 billion to 90 billion euros ($63-123 billion),
depending on how much Dublin needs in support for its banks.
 The ECB is now channelling about a quarter of its loans to
banks in Ireland. Ireland has said the bill for bailing out its
lenders could top 50 billion euros, but investors fear the final
figure could be worse.

 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a six-week high
against the euro on Tuesday, extending gains after U.S. Treasury
yields jumped as investors closed out bets before market
liquidity declines towards the year-end.
 The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield soared 17 basis points on
Monday for its biggest one-day rise since June 2009, giving a
broad lift to the greenback.
 Besides the rise in U.S. yields, the euro was hurt by worries
about fiscal troubles in Ireland and Portugal, with investors
focusing on meetings of European finance officials on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
 The euro hit a six-week low of $1.3560 on Tuesday on trading
platform EBS. It last stood at $1.3572, down 0.1 percent from
late U.S. trading on Monday.
 ""U.S. bonds were sold at a time when seasonal position
unwinding tends to appear and the dollar has been bought back,""
said a trader for a European bank in Tokyo.
 Such seasonal position unwinding could continue ahead of next
week's U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, the trader said.
 The euro was hovering right near its 55-day moving average,
which now lies at $1.3566 and a clear break below could open the
way for a further drop.
 One target may be the 38.2 percent retracement of its June to
November rally that now lies at $1.3364.
 In addition, the dollar's rise above its 55-day moving
averages against the yen and Swiss franc on Monday, suggest it
may be poised to see further gains against those currencies in
the near term.
 The dollar rose 0.1 percent against the yen from late U.S.
trading on Monday to 83.18 yen, near a six-week high of 83.28 yen
marked on trading platform EBS on Monday.
 The dollar's 55-day moving average now lies at 82.83 yen,
offering support. It faces resistance on daily ichimoku charts at
83.17 yen, the bottom of the cloud, and then at the top of the
cloud at 84.13 yen.
 Gains in the dollar could be limited during Asian trading,
since Japanese exporters seem likely to sell it, said the trader
for a European bank.

 NEW YORK, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar climbed to a
six-week high against major currencies on Monday as worries
about Ireland's debt crisis persisted, hurting the euro, while
rising U.S. bond yields increased the greenback's appeal.
 Global equity markets ended little changed to slightly
lower as concerns the Federal Reserve may scale back efforts to
stimulate the economy muted optimism over two big takeover
bids.
 A rise in the 10-year U.S. Treasury note's yield to a
three-month high also buoyed the dollar, as bond investors
unwound positions taken in advance of the Federal Reserve's
second program of long-term purchases of government debt.
 Concerns about Ireland's ability to repay its debt and that
its problems may spread throughout the euro zone rekindled the
dollar's appeal as a safe-haven.
 ""The euro fell below $1.36 and is set to remain under
pressure in the near term as investors focused on fiscal
troubles in Ireland and Portugal and await meetings of European
finance ministers on Tuesday and Wednesday,"" said Greg
Farinella, managing director and head of Treasury and trading
at Espirito Santo Investment S.A. in New York.
 ""The issues in Europe have been very focal the last couple
of days and that's lending itself to euro weakness.""
 News that a group of Republican economists and financial
services executives will launch a campaign this week urging the
Fed to drop the plan to buy $600 billion of Treasuries spurred
a rise in government bond yields and boosted the dollar.
 Helping to motivate the sell-off in U.S. debt was the
rationale that the economy could improve soon, making further
large-scale asset purchases by the Fed -- after the $600
billion it committed to buy at its November policy meeting --
unnecessary.
 The rise in U.S. yields has enhanced the appeal of
dollar-denominated assets.
 The U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>, which measures the dollar's
performance against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.69
percent to 78.619 after earlier rising as high as 78.629. It
has now recouped all losses made after the Fed's Nov. 3
announcement of a second round of quantitative easing.
 The euro  fell 0.77 percent to $1.3585, while the
dollar gained 0.82 percent to 83.28 yen , touching a
five-week high as U.S. Treasury yields surged.

possibility of a bailout. [ID:nLDE68T0MG] The euro has taken a
hit in the past week as Irish bond yields have jumped on the
country's struggles to control its spiraling debt.
 The debt-laden country is fully funded for 2010, but Irish
press reports said on Monday it was considering asking for
money for its banks, and other European governments were keen
to avoid a contagion to other peripheral countries.
 ""A lot of this is going to depend on how severe this whole
euro-zone crisis becomes. Everybody is really focused on the
Wednesday meeting with euro-zone finance ministers,"" said Boris
Schlossberg, director of currency research at GFT in New York.
 ""If they can't come up with some tangible resolution to the
Irish problem, then the dollar definitely gets the benefit
risk-aversion flows,"" he added.
 U.S. data showed U.S. retailers' sales rose more than

 STOCKS LOSE STEAM
 U.S. stocks ended slightly lower as the energy and
materials sectors, which are sensitive to commodity prices and
weaken when the dollar rises, led the way down as the Treasury
market sell-off picked up steam in the afternoon.

the world's second-largest economy for commodities and other
imports.
 The U.S. 30-year Treasury bond lost 2 points in late
trading as dealers exited bets they had put on the Federal

47/32, with the yield at 2.9575 percent. The 2-year U.S.

 NEW YORK, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a six-week high
against the euro on Monday as worries about Ireland's ability
to repay debt and concerns its problems may spread through the
euro zone rekindled the greenback's appeal as a safe haven.
 The surge in Treasury yields also supported the dollar
against the yen, pushing the U.S. currency to its strongest
level since Oct.5, according to EBS data. The dollar/yen pair
has been the most sensitive to movements in bond yields because
both currencies compete as the markets' favored funding unit in
carry trades.
 With yields rising in the United States more than in Japan,
the cost of carry in the dollar becomes more expensive. That
should prompt investors to use the yen, which offer lower rates
and less volatility, to wade back into speculative assets.
 The euro fell below $1.36 and is set to remain under
pressure in the near term as investors focused on fiscal
troubles in Ireland and Portugal and await meetings of European
finance ministers on Tuesday and Wednesday.
 ""The issues in Europe have been very focal the last couple
of days and that's lending itself to euro weakness,"" said Greg
Farinella, managing director and head of Treasury and trading
at Espirito Santo Investment S.A. in New York. Espirito Santo
is the investment banking arm of Banco Espirito Santo, the
second largest bank in Portugal.
 Ireland on Monday denied making any application for funding
to shore up the country's finances. But Prime Minister Brian
Cowen said the country's high funding cost would make it hard
for banks to support the recovery.
 Ireland's high borrowing costs and large deficit spawned
fears of a Greek-style scenario where budget problems in one
country plunge the entire euro zone into crisis.
 In late afternoon trading, the ICE Futures' dollar index,
which tracks the greenback versus a basket of currencies, rose
0.6 percent to 78.532, having hit a high of 78.707, its
strongest since early October.
 INVESTORS TRIM DOLLAR SHORTS
 Currency speculators also trimmed their short positions on
the U.S. dollar in the latest week, according to data from the
Commodity Futures trading Commission. Net shorts on the dollar
fell to $21.85 billion from $24.53 billion the previous week.
 The dollar rose 0.6 percent to 83.01 yen, after touching a
near 6-week high of 83.28 yen on trading platform EBS, boosted
by the surge in U.S. Treasury yields.
 Yields on the 10-year note hit a three-month high on Monday
as dealers and investors closed out more bets tied to the
Federal Reserve's $600 billion bond purchase program. The
dollar/yen pair has closely tracked U.S. 2-year yields, with a
25-day correlation of 0.84 on Monday.
 Since the Fed's announcement of more bond purchases on Nov
3, the benchmark 10-year note yield has climbed more than a
quarter percentage point to 2.93 percent on Monday, its highest
since at least early August. The two-year yield rose to 0.53
percent, its highest in two months.
 In late trading, the euro slipped 0.8 percent to $1.3577,
after earlier falling to $1.3564, its lowest since late
September. On the month, the euro was down 2.7 percent.
 Portugal is also high on investors' alert list. Finance
Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos was quoted as saying on
Monday by the Financial Times that there is a high risk
Portugal will have to seek foreign financial aid.
 The minister told Reuters, however, that Portugal has no
plans to request emergency foreign funding.
 The euro also had support at its 55-day moving average at
around $1.3550, a level in which there are reportedly option
barriers. The dollar index, meanwhile, must clear its 55-day
average at 78.97 to extend its rally, traders said.
 Attention will squarely turn to bailouts and promises of
bailouts when the Eurogroup meeting of EZ Finance Ministers
takes place on Tuesday. Ahead of the meeting, Irish spreads
narrowed by around 20 basis points as investors speculated
about a possible deal on Ireland, traders said.

 By Matt Falloon
 LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Britain's global influence is not
in decline but the country must repair its economy quickly to
remain a leading actor on the world stage, Prime Minister David
Cameron said on Monday.
 Britain is recovering from its worst recession since World
War Two but Cameron said the rise of new economic powers did not
spell the end of British influence and the country remained a
major economic and military power.
 ""There are some who say Britain is embarked on an inevitable
path of decline,"" Cameron said in a major foreign policy speech
in London's financial district. ""I want to take that argument
head on. Britain remains a great economic power.""
 Cameron came to power in May at the head of a coalition that
is determined to slash public spending after a banking crisis
and a deep recession sent the budget deficit soaring to 11
percent of national output, a peacetime record.
 The squeeze on public spending will lead to cuts in defence
and public services and could throw half a million government
employees out of work.
 Cameron said foreign leaders respected Britain's
determination to ""get our economic house in order"", which was
essential if the country was to continue to carry weight in the
world.
 ""Economic strength will restore our respect in the world and
our national self-confidence,"" he said.
 UK economic growth has been stronger than expected this year
but a slowdown is expected in 2011, largely because of the
government's efforts to slash the deficit.
 
 HARD-HEADED APPROACH
 Cameron pledged to defend London's position as a leading
world financial centre. A European Union drive for tighter
regulation of hedge funds and private equity groups -- many of
which are based in London -- following the financial crisis led
to fierce battles between Britain and France.
 ""I can promise you this: We will stand up, at each and every
turn, for our financial services industry and the City of
London,"" he said.
 He hailed the release of Myanmar pro-democracy leader Aung
San Suu Kyi, saying it was a ""fantastic sight"" to see her free.
 Cameron has recalibrated British foreign policy to focus on
fostering business ties across the world in an effort to boost
exports. Britain has 9,500 troops in Afghanistan, the second
biggest foreign force, but defence cuts mean it will not have an
aircraft carrier equipped with fast jets for the next decade.
 ""We ... have to be more strategic and hard-headed about how
we go about advancing our national interests,"" Cameron said.
 Britain's relationship with the United States is ""crucial""
because of close bilateral cooperation on defence,
counter-terrorism and intelligence, Cameron said. Britain was a
""strong and active"" member of the 27-nation EU, he said.
 But he said there were other areas where British policy
needed to change. ""We must link our economy up with the
fastest-growing parts of the world, placing our commercial
interest at the heart of our foreign policy,"" he said.
 Britain will apply the ""more strategic and hard-headed""
approach to the mission in Afghanistan and will focus more of
its foreign aid budget on preventing conflict, he said.

(Adds USTR, U.S. business group comment)
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Negotiators from nearly 40
countries have finalized the text of an international agreement
to help fight the growing trade in fake and pirated goods, the
European Commission and the United States said on Monday.
 The negotiators settled a handful of differences that held
up a deal on the Anti-Counterfeit Trade Agreement (ACTA) in
Tokyo last month.
 ""The efforts of the EU and its ACTA partners will mean
improved international standards of intellectual property
rights enforcement whilst fully respecting the rights of
citizens,"" European Union Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht
said in a statement.
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
has estimated that global trade in counterfeit and pirated
goods rose to $250 billion in 2007 from $100 billion in 2000.
 Countries particpating in talks were the United States, the
European Union and its 27 member states, Australia, Canada,
Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and Switzerland, and
two developing countries -- Morocco and Mexico.
 Talks had largely pitted the United States against the EU,
with the EU demanding broad protection for its traditional food
names such as Parmesan cheese -- known as geographical
indicators -- as well as for fashion and car designs.
 The United States and some other countries appealed for a
narrower agreement that would protect mainly copyright and
trademarks, whose violation has ravaged profits in the U.S.
entertainment industry.
 The current text still needs approval and ratification by
each of the negotiators' legal teams, assemblies and, in the
case of the EU, member states -- a process that may take until
late 2011 to complete, an EU official said.
 U.S. President Barack Obama's administration will ask for
public comment on the agreement before formally deciding
whether to sign the agreement, said Nefeterius McPherson, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office.
 Some critics want Obama to submit the agreement to Congress
for approval. The administration has said that is not needed
because the pact does not require any changes to U.S. law.
 SETTLING DIFFERENCES
 The text will allow signatories to chose whether to make
the illegal ""camcording"" of films in a cinema a criminal
offense. Countries that do criminalise camcording will have no
compulsory jail sentences -- a victory to the EU, which had
argued against criminal penalties.
 The new text puts the enforcement of trademarks and
geographical indicators at the border on a more equal footing
with copyright and patents compared to previous texts, an EU
spokesman said.
 But in a compromise by the EU, the new text is less
explicit about penalising people who set up websites to sell
fake goods. The United States, backed by South Korea and
Mexico, had demanded greater focus on copyright violations like
illegal file-sharing of music and films.
 Food names that are seen as generic will keep that status
in their country, allowing Kraft for instance to continue
selling parmesan cheese that doesn't come from the Italian
region.
The countries hope large trading nations such as China,
India and Brazil will eventually join the pact.
 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a leading business group,
said it was still reviewing the final language but welcomed
Monday's announcement as a major step.
 ""Proactive policies that curb IP theft such as ACTA are
absolutely necessary to ensure our continued economic recovery
by protecting American innovators, consumers, and workers,"" the
group said in a statement.

 By Gleb Bryanski
 MOSCOW, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Russia should accelerate efforts
to enter the World Trade Organisation (WTO), President Dmitry
Medvedev said on Monday on his return to Moscow after a meeting
with U.S. President Barack Obama. 
 Russia, the largest economy outside the trade watchdog, has
said it aims to join the WTO in 2011 and only technical issues
remain before the accession Working Party completes its report,
which will be a foundation for membership. 
 ""I believe that we should accelerate our efforts to enter

Minister Igor Shuvalov, who is responsible for accession talks
in the government. 
 At a previous meeting with Obama in June the two leaders
agreed to resolve all the differences by Sept. 30, but Shuvalov
blamed the United States for the lack of accord on imports of
encryption equipment and software to Russia. 
 ""We submitted (to the U.S.) our proposals on imports of
encryption equipment but the U.S. has not yet held necessary
consultations with businesses and has so far not made any
counter proposals,"" he added. 
 ""Hurry them up, we were thinking that everything was ready,""
Medvedev said, referring to his meeting with Obama. 
 Under Russian laws encryption equipment and software can be
imported to Russia only with permission from the FSB domestic
security agency.
Shuvalov said the Russian WTO delegation will shortly travel
to Brussels to resolve remaining differences with the European
Union, mainly related to Russian timber exports. 
 ""We have tried to find a compromise solution that would
reconcile interests of investors who are already investing in
timber processing in Russia with the need to keep EU processing
plants operational,"" Shuvalov said. 
 He said WTO accession took priority over Russia's ambition
to develop its own timber processing industry, and added that he
hoped to resolve the timber issue during the visit. 
 ""The compromise should be found. We need to move through the
remaining part of the road rather quickly,"" Medvedev said. 
 Russia expects the Working Party to complete its report next
spring, but the Russian bid faces a veto by Georgia, which has
said it wants to block Russian membership. The two countries
fought a brief war in 2008.
 WTO members cannot use their veto rights for political
purposes but Georgia says it wants to station its own customs
officials at the border between Russia and two Georgian
breakaway regions which declared independence after the 2008
war.
 Obama and Medvedev discussed the Georgian veto on the
sidelines of the APEC summit in Yokohama. Russia believes the
United States can push its ally Georgia into dropping its
demands.

(Updates with European markets' close)
 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar climbed to a
six-week high against major currencies on Monday as worries
about Ireland's debt crisis persisted, hurting the euro, while
rising U.S. bond yields increased the greenback's appeal.
 In the global equity markets, stocks got a boost from
proposed acquisitions in the mining and auto sectors.
 A rise in the 10-year U.S. Treasury note's yield to a
three-month high buoyed the dollar, as investors sold bonds
following news that a group of Republican economists and
financial services executives will launch a campaign this week
urging the Federal Reserve to drop the plan to buy $600
billion of Treasuries. For details, see [ID:nN15258759]
 Increased criticism of the Fed's monetary policy, ranging
from leading officials of countries such as Russia and China
to some Republican lawmakers and economists, reinforced the
inclination to sell Treasuries and take profits before year
end.
 U.S. data showed U.S. retailers' sales rose more than
expected in October, suggesting the economic recovery was on
track. But a separate report showed an index of manufacturing
in New York State fell in November to its lowest since April
2009 after new orders and shipments tumbled. [ID:nN12137914]
and [ID:nN15243086].
 ""The recovery in the dollar had been driven by consistent
surprises in U.S. data over the past two weeks and the
disappointing Empire State survey reminded traders that the
recovery in the U.S. economy is still uneven,"" said Kathy
Lien, director of currency research at GFT in New York.
 But she said the dollar should recoup its initial losses
as consumer spending is the U.S. economy's main driver.
 The U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>, which measures the dollar's
performance against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.45
percent to 78.435, after earlier rising as high as 78.629. It
has now recouped all losses made after the Fed's Nov. 3
announcement for a second round of quantitative easing.
 The euro  fell 0.52 percent to $1.3619, while the
dollar gained 0.29 percent to 82.74 yen , after having
earlier touched 83.28 yen on trading platform EBS.
 Investors sold the euro as Ireland struggled to convince
them it was in control of its debt problems, leaving open the
possibility of a bailout. [ID:nLDE68T0MG]
The euro has taken a hit in the past week as Irish bond
yields have jumped on the country's struggles to control its
spiraling debt.
 The debt-laden country is fully funded for 2010, but Irish
press reports said on Monday it was considering asking for
money for its banks, and other European governments were keen
to avoid a contagion to other peripheral countries.
 ""A lot of this is going to depend on how severe this whole
euro-zone crisis becomes. Everybody is really focused on the
Wednesday meeting with euro-zone finance ministers,"" said
Boris Schlossberg, director of currency research at GFT in New
York.
 ""If they can't come up with some tangible resolution to
the Irish problem, then the dollar definitely gets the benefit
risk-aversion flows,"" he added.
 M&A LIFTS STOCKS
 U.S. stocks rose as two large proposed acquisitions
suggested that investors see value in certain stocks at
current elevated levels in a trend that could carry the market
through year end.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> climbed 84.54
points, or 0.76 percent, to 11,277.12. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> gained 7.31 points, or 0.61 percent, to
1,206.52. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> rose 12.47
points, or 0.50 percent, to 2,530.68.
 Caterpillar Inc  agreed to buy mining equipment
maker Bucyrus International Inc  for $7.6 billion,
pushing Bucyrus' shares up almost 29 percent to $89.76.
Caterpillar, a Dow component, rose nearly 3 percent to $83.45.
For details, see [ID:nLDE6AE1EV]
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index<.FTEU3> of top European shares
gained 0.75 percent, after falling for three straight
sessions. European stocks rallied on news that German truck
maker MAN SE  and Sweden's Scania  were in
talks over a possible merger, in a move that could result in
Volkswagen  taking full control of both.
[ID:nLDE6AE0BD]
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> gained 1.1 percent to close at
9,827.51, near a 4-1/2-month high hit last week, helped by a
weaker yen and better-than-expected Japanese growth data for
the third quarter.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> was
up 0.3 percent.
 Persistent concerns that China will raise interest rates
further also spurred selling of riskier assets as traders
worried policy tightening will curb the robust demand of the
the world's second-largest economy for commodities and other
imports.
 U.S. Treasuries fell as dealers and investors closed out
more bets tied to the Federal Reserve's $600 billion bond-
purchase program, known as QE2.
 On Monday, the Fed bought $7.92 billion in Treasury debt
maturing between September 2016 and November 2017, in another
purchase that's part of its second round of quantitative
easing, or QE2. On Friday, the Fed bought $7.23 billion in
Treasury paper maturing in four to six years -- the first of
$600 billion in asset purchases the U.S. central bank said it
would make in an effort to help stimulate the sluggish
economy.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 9/32, with the yield at 2.825 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was up 1/32 with the yield at 0.50
percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was down
2/32, with the yield at 4.298 percent.
 In the energy and commodity markets, U.S. crude oil
futures  rose 26 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $85.14 per
barrel, and spot gold  rose $2.66, or 0.19 percent, to
$1,371.00 an ounce, steadying after its biggest one-day fall
since July 1 the previous session.
 Gold's drop from last week's record $1,424.10 an ounce was
on concern the market had become overbought and as talk of
China's potential interest-rate rise knocked commodity prices
sharply lower.

 * Some countries say proposal should also cover human food
 * Source says vote on proposal unlikely before January 2011
 
 By Charlie Dunmore
 BRUSSELS, Nov 15 (Reuters) - A number of European Union
governments on Monday urged the bloc's executive to allow tiny
traces of genetically modified (GM) material in food imports for
human consumption as well as in animal feed, an EU source said.
 But it is not yet clear whether enough EU governments
support the change to force the European Commission to amend its
proposal, and a final decision is unlikely before January at the
earliest.
 The Commission has proposed allowing up to 0.1 percent of
unapproved GM material in feed imports, provided the GM crop in
question has been approved in the exporting country and there is
a valid EU testing method for the unapproved variety.
 EU and national officials met in Brussels late on Monday to
discuss the draft plans, which are meant to avoid a repeat of
last year's disruption to feed imports, when several U.S. grain
shipments were blocked after being found to contain traces of
unapproved GM material.
 A number of member states asked the Commission to include
food imports in the proposal, said the source, who was in the
meeting and would not specify which countries requested the
change.
 ""They wanted more clarification on why feed and not food.
Some welcomed the approach, some were reluctant and some asked
for clarification,"" the source said.
 The demand by some states followed warnings from EU
importers and the bloc's main trade partners, who have said a
feed-only approach would be unworkable because it is impossible
to separate the global grain supply chain into food and feed.
 The Commission has said it wants to address feed imports
first, given that they have the greatest economic impact in
terms of overall EU imports, and that a similar solution for
food could be agreed in future should the need arise.
 Despite the concerns expressed by some EU governments, the
question remains whether enough of them are prepared to openly
push to include food, given the strength of the public's
distaste for GM products in most EU countries.
 Several officials in the meeting said their governments
still didn't have a final position on the issue, and as a result
a committee vote on the Commission's proposal is unlikely before
January at the earliest, the source added.
 If approved by the committee of member state experts, EU
ministers and the European Parliament would then have three
months to either accept or reject the proposal, meaning that it
could be finalised in the first half of 2011

"
113,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2010 01:44PM ET</span>",Q+A - How could Ireland tap EU emergency funds," BRUSSELS/DUBLIN, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Ireland is in talks with
the European Union on potential financial aid amid EU pressure
for quick action to prevent tensions surrounding the Irish debt
spilling over into other euro zone countries.
 The Irish government said it would not need a bailout, but a
senior member of the European Central Bank confirmed discussions
were under way with Dublin and said that aid, if requested,
would be available for Ireland's banks or for the state itself.

 WHAT IS AVAILABLE?
 The European Union safety net consists of the European
Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM), which can lend up to 60
billion euros and the European Financial Stability Facility
(EFSF), which is backed by 440 billion euros worth of euro zone
government guarantees. 
 On top of that, the International Monetary Fund can lend
additional money and the IMF has said it was ready to provide up
to 50 percent of what Europe was providing.

 WHO WOULD LEND FIRST?
 If Ireland asks for and is granted a financing package, it
would be from all three sources, an EU source said.
 Money from the EFSM would be paid out first, but EFSF cash
and the IMF would also be involved, because the EU wants to
avoid a situation where one country uses up all the funds
available under the EFSM.
 The amount provided by the IMF would be negotiated on a
case-by-case basis and does not have to be 50 percent of the
European input, it can just as well be 30 percent, the EU source
said.
 The EFSM is available to all 27 EU members while the EFSF
will lend only to the 16 countries of the euro zone.

 HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE?
 The mechanism has never been used before, but EU officials
estimate it would take between 3 and 5 weeks from the
application for assistance and the first disbursement of money.
 Ireland was set to unveil its four-year fiscal plan later
this month, possibly in the week beginning Nov. 22, and that
would presumably underpin any bailout. 
 Dublin was also planning to return to bond markets in
January so having a bailout in place before the end of the year
would remove that deadline for the country.

 HOW WOULD IT START?
 1. Ireland would have to send a request for help to the
European Commission in which it would say how much money it
needs and what steps it plans to take to restore financial
stability. It would send the draft reform programme to the
Commission and to the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC) of
junior finance ministers and central bankers.
 2. The European Commission, in liaison with the European
Central Bank, would assess the request and recommend to EU
finance ministers to accept or reject it.
 3. EU ministers would vote on the Commission proposal with a
qualified majority.
 4. If they say 'yes', the ministers would also say how much
money Ireland would get, in what tranches, when, as well as set
conditions for the help. The conditions are drawn up by the
Commission in consultation with the European Central Bank.
 5. Ireland and the Commission would sign a memorandum of
understanding, which would contain the conditions for help.
 6. The Commission would raise the money on the market by
issuing bonds using the EU budget as collateral. The EU
executive would pay out the tranches to Ireland.
 7. If Ireland were to seek funds from the International
Monetary Fund, apart from the EU help, it would first have to
tell the Commission about it. The Commission would see what
financing options are still available under EU schemes and
inform the EFC as well.
 8. The aid money would be paid out in instalments after
regular checks by the Commission that Ireland is on track with
its reform programme.

 CONDITIONS
 The EU/IMF would seek strict conditions on its loans and may
require Dublin to consider tax hikes and spending cuts
previously thought unpalatable.
 Currently, Ireland is aiming for fiscal adjustments
totalling 15 billion euros between now and 2014, a doubling of
its previous target. Under a bailout scenario, the adjustments
may be even harsher.
 The EU could insist Dublin reneges on an agreement with
public sector unions not to cut jobs or push through further
wage cuts. Brussels may also demand Ireland raises its
corporation tax rate, viewed as sacrosanct by Dublin, from its
current low level of 12.5 percent. 
 Greece had to raise its rate of Value Added Tax (VAT) to 23
percent from 19 percent as part of its bailout package and
Ireland may have to increase its VAT level from 21 percent
currently.

 WHAT WOULD BE THE COST FOR IRELAND?
 The blueprint for EU support - although not binding - is the
financial aid package to Greece where, for variable-rate loans,
the basis is three-month Euribor, while fixed rate loans are
based upon the rates corresponding to swap rates for the
relevant maturities. 
 In addition there is a charge of 300 basis points for
maturities up to three years and an extra 100 basis points per
year for loans longer than three years. A onetime service fee of
50 basis points is charged to cover operational costs.
 The cost of borrowing is roughly around five percent.
 While there are no limits on the maturities of the loans to
the country in need, the Greek case has set a precedent of 3-5
year loans.

 HOW MUCH WOULD IRELAND NEED?
 Any bailout needs to be big enough to bring to a close, once
and for all, uncertainty over whether future Irish bank loan
losses could rattle the sovereign and destabilise the euro zone.
 Ireland has pegged its worst-case scenario for its banks'
bailout at 50 billion euros but investors don't believe the
government's assessment after previous forecasts were raised.
 A bailout for the banks wouldn't necessarily have to equal
or exceed 50 billion euros because Ireland has already pledged
33 billion euros for its banking sector but it would likely have
to be well above 17 billion euros to reflect investor concerns
about losses breaching the latest worst-case scenario.
 Ireland's banks are dependent on ECB support, a whopping 130
billion euros in funding at the end of October, and presumably
this support would continue until markets had calmed down enough
for lenders to start accessing wholesale funding markets again.
 Ireland's government is looking at raising around 63 billion
euros over the next three years, according to a presentation by
the country's debt management agency last week. A bailout that
encompasses both the sovereign and the banks may therefore come
in around 80 billion euros.
 A Reuters poll last week pegged the price of any bailout at
around 48 billion euros, according to the median of forecasts
from 10 respondents who gave a figure. [ID:nLDE6AA0UH]
 Euro zone sources have said the range could be between 45
and 90 billion euros depending on whether Dublin needs money for
its banking sector, or not.

 CAN IRELAND USE THE MONEY TO SUPPORT ITS BANKS?
 Yes. While the EU funds cannot be accessed by Irish banks
directly, the Irish government can borrow from the EFSM or EFSF
and use the cash to support its banking sector.

 WHY IRELAND IS NOT KEEN ON EU HELP?
 An EU bailout would mean a big loss of face for a country
once feted for its rags to riches transformation and proud of
its struggle for independence from Britain.
 But if Brussels insists on external assistance there is
little Prime Minister Brian Cowen can do but accept. Ireland's
membership of the euro zone saved it from an Icelandic-style
collapse and the ECB is keeping its banks afloat.
 Ireland's opposition parties will make much of the country's
loss of sovereignty in the event of a bailout but they are
unlikely to obstruct it. There is no real alternative and they
can blame the government for bringing it in.
 Cowen's parliamentary majority is likely to be cut to just
two after a by-election later this month and most analysts
expect an early general election in the first half of next year
when two further by-elections are expected to wipe out his
majority. A coalition of the centre-right Fine Gael and
centre-left Labour party would likely form a new government
following a general election.
 Dangling an axe over the public sector and raising VAT and
corporation tax would be hugely controversial. Trade unions
would demonstrate against any pay cuts or job losses and there
is the risk of strike action. There has not been any civil
unrest in Ireland despite two years of austerity and the worst
recession in the industrialised world but an extremely harsh set
of measures could prompt violent protests.
 Business elites would lobby intensively against any increase
to the corporation tax or VAT. However, a marginal increase in
the corporation tax rate is unlikely to trigger an exodus of
multinationals. A VAT increase would encourage more Irish people
to cross the border and do their shopping in Northern Ireland,
where VAT is currently 17.5 percent. Britain's VAT rate is set
to increase to 20 percent next year.

 By Lorraine Turner and Natsuko Waki
 DUBLIN, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Ireland signalled on Monday its
banks, not the state, could need help with funding but its
impatient euro zone partners urged a swift decision on any EU
rescue, saying the uncertainty was rattling markets and hurting
them.
 Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen, whose parliamentary
majority is on a knife-edge as he wrestles with the worst
economic crisis in a generation, said high borrowing costs were
making it hard for banks to support an economic recovery.
 European finance officials would discuss funding costs and
other issues at a meeting on Tuesday, said Cowan, who repeated
Ireland had not applied for funding to help finance the state,
whose debt was funded until mid-2011.
 ""(We have to discuss) how best to underpin financial and
banking stability within the euro area,"" he told national
broadcaster RTE.
 ""Having that kind of cost of money...as an ongoing basis if
it were to become a norm would make it difficult for banks to
function as engines of recovery,"" he said.
 Ireland's borrowing costs shot to record highs in the past
week on concerns a mammoth bill for bailing out its banks could
rise further. That combined with growing borrowing costs to
trigger fears of a Greek-style scenario where budget problems in
one country plunge the entire euro zone into crisis.
 Cowen has been reluctant to seek help on Ireland's sovereign
debt, apparently hoping passage of a 2011 austerity budget early
next month will avoid the need for a bailout.
 His government faces a by-election it can ill afford to
lose on Nov. 25 and wants to preserve its sovereignty, including
a low corporation tax which is a key plank of Ireland's economic
strategy.
 However, countries on the euro zone's periphery are growing
impatient as their borrowing costs have spiralled as a result of
Ireland's troubles.
 Bank of Spain Governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, a
member of the ECB's governing council, told a banking conference
in Madrid Dublin's indecision had increased jitters on financial
markets.
 ""The situation in the markets has been negative due in some
part to the lack of a decision by Ireland. It's not up to me to
make a decision on Ireland, it's Ireland that should take the
decision at the right moment."" 
 Ewald Nowotny, another ECB governing council member, said in
a radio interview the EU wanted a ""quick, good solution to
Ireland, so that there will be no spill-over"" to other heavily
indebted countries such as Portugal and Spain.
 Portuguese Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos
said Ireland had to consider the entire euro zone's needs.
 ""I want to believe they will decide to do what is most
appropriate together for Ireland and the euro. I want to believe
they have the vision to take the right decision,"" the Wall
Street Journal quoted him as saying. 
 A senior member of the European Central Bank confirmed
discussions were under way with Dublin and said that aid, if
requested, would be available for Ireland's banks or for the
state itself.
 There was some market speculation that euro zone finance
ministers could announce some form of support after Tuesday's
meeting. That helped peripheral euro zone debt yields outperform
safe-haven German debt on Monday, as belief grew among investors
that Ireland was edging closer to seeking EU aid.
 Irish 10-year bond yields remained at historically high
levels but fell to 8.15 percent, down around 30 basis points on
the day.
 But Eurogroup chairman Jean Claude-Juncker said Ireland had
not requested aid and that a deal was not imminent.
 ""The Irish think that they can keep the problems they're
facing under control,"" he told news agency Bloomberg. ""They are
not near the point where they would ask for external help.""
 
 ""IRISH CONTAGION""
 European Central Bank Vice President Vitor Constancio said
Ireland had been talking to European institutions but there had
not yet been a formal request for assistance.
 ""The Irish state is financed until part of next year, but it
is also a problem of the banks that are at the centre of the
problems in Ireland and considerations have to be pondered,"" he
told a news conference in Vienna.
 Constancio said such help, if needed, could involve the 440
billion euro European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) set up
after Greece was forced to seek help in May.
 EU sources say aid under discussion ranges from 45 billion
to 90 billion euros ($63 billion-$123 billion), depending on
whether Ireland needs support for its banks.
 Teixeira dos Santos told Reuters Portugal was being affected
by ""contagion from the situation in Ireland"" but Lisbon did not
have the same problems with its banks that faced Ireland.
 Lisbon had no plans to request emergency foreign funding
after the Financial Times quoted him as saying there was a high
risk Lisbon would have to seek aid.
 ""Such a request is not imminent, there are no contacts, be
it formal or informal,"" he told Reuters. ""The rest are rumours
and speculation.""
 Ireland and others say Germany has aggravated problems by
pushing the idea of asset value reductions or ""haircuts"" for
private bondholders under a permanent euro zone rescue mechanism
which Berlin wants in place from 2013.
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said Berlin's demand
that banks and bond markets share the pain of a sovereign debt
default could push some euro zone economies towards bankruptcy.
 ""It created a spiral of higher interest rates for countries
that seemed to be in a difficult position, such as Ireland or
Portugal,"" Papandreou said during a visit to Paris.
 ""This could create a self-fulfilling prophecy ... This could
break backs. This could force economies towards bankruptcy.""

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a six-week
high against major currencies on Monday, buoyed by worries
about euro zone debt woes and as rising U.S. bond yields lifted
the appeal of dollar-denominated assets.
 The euro fell beneath $1.36 and is set to remain under
pressure in the near-term as investors focus on fiscal troubles
in Ireland and Portugal and await meetings of European finance
ministers on Tuesday and Wednesday.
 Focus has shifted away from concerns about the U.S. economy
back to a deepening debt crisis in the euro zone. That could
boost the dollar further into the year-end as investors book
profits on their short dollar bets built up before the Federal
Reserve's decision earlier this month to print more money.
 ""A lot of this is going to depend on how severe this whole
euro zone crisis becomes. Everybody is really focused on the
Wednesday meeting with euro zone finance ministers,"" said Boris
Schlossberg, director of currency research at GFT in New York.
 ""If they can't come up with some tangible resolution to the
Irish problem, then the dollar definitely gets the benefit
risk-aversion flows,"" he added.
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a
basket of currencies, rose 0.5 percent to 78.431, having hit a
high of 78.629, its strongest since early October.
 U.S. Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year yield hitting a
three-month high earlier after the Wall Street Journal reported
that a group of Republican-leaning economists is calling for
the Fed to drop its plan to buy $600 billion of Treasuries.
 Since the Fed's announcement of more bond purchases on Nov
3, the benchmark 10-year yield has climbed more than a quarter
percentage point to 2.84 percent on Monday, its highest since
early August. The two-year yield has increased to 0.52 percent,
its highest in two months.
 The dollar rose 0.4 percent to 82.81 yen, after having
touched a near 6-week high of 83.28 yen on trading platform
EBS. The dollar/yen pair has closely tracked U.S. 2-year
yields, with a 25-day correlation of 0.84 on Monday.
 John Kosar, director of research at Asbury Research in
Chicago, said the dollar has tested significant support levels
versus both the euro and yen over the past month and some
momentum tools ""are starting to turn positive on the dollar.""
 ""The larger dollar downtrend is still very much intact. I
don't know there's been any sea change in terms of the
economics that would force the dollar to make a major trend
change. For now, we're looking at this as being a correction
rather than something sustainable,"" he said.
 EURO SUFFERS
 The euro slipped 0.5 percent to $1.3619. It also lost 0.2
percent to 112.79 yen. The single currency has taken a hit in
the past week or so as Ireland struggled to convince investors
it was in control of its debt problems, leaving open the
possibility of a bailout.
 The euro also had support at its 55-day moving average at
around $1.3550, while the dollar index must clear its 55-day
average at 78.97 to extend its rally, traders said.
 There is a high risk Portugal will have to seek foreign
financial aid, Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos
was quoted as saying on Monday by the Financial Times. But the
minister told Reuters that Portugal has no plans to request
emergency foreign funding.
 Ireland's opposition said on Monday it believed Europe had
started moves to rescue debt-ridden Dublin and pressure grew
for quick action to prevent the crisis from spreading. Irish
Finance Minister Brian Lenihan will discuss the situation with
other euro zone finance ministers at meetings this week.
 Some analysts were unconvinced a possible rescue plan for
Ireland would offer much support for the euro, given other
countries including Portugal are also battling debt problems.
 Earlier, the dollar pared gains after data showed a
manufacturing gauge in New York state fell this month to its
lowest level since April 2009. The report offset a
stronger-than-expected reading of retail sales and raised
concerns that the U.S. economic recovery remains uneven.

 By Adrian Croft and Nigel Davies
 LONDON/MADRID, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Ireland's opposition said
on Monday it believed Europe had started moves to rescue
debt-ridden Dublin and pressure grew for quick action to prevent
the crisis spilling over into other euro zone countries.
 The Irish government denied it would need a bailout, but a
senior member of the European Central Bank confirmed discussions
were under way with Dublin and said that aid, if requested,
would be available for Ireland's banks or for the state itself.
 The governor of the Bank of Spain, one of a number of
countries on the euro zone's periphery which has debt problems
and has seen its borrowing costs spiral as a result of Ireland's
problems, prodded Dublin to act quickly by saying its indecision
had increased jitters on financial markets.
 Portuguese Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos
told Reuters there were no plans for it to request emergency
foreign funding after the Financial Times quoted him as saying
there was a high risk Lisbon would have to seek aid.
 ""Such a request is not imminent, there are no contacts, be
it formal or informal,"" Teixeira dos Santos told Reuters. ""The
rest are rumours and speculation.""
 Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan will discuss the
situation with other euro zone finance ministers in Brussels on
Tuesday and ministers from the other European Union states will
join them on Wednesday.
 ""I'm extremely concerned. I think the reports (of an
imminent bailout) over the weekend are true ... I think there is
European intervention under way,"" the Irish opposition's finance
spokesman, Michael Noonan, told the BBC.
 Noonan, who could become finance minister if the government
falls, said he believed matters would come to a head in the next
24 hours, given the euro zone ministerial meeting, and that a
bailout could lead to Ireland being suspended from bond markets
for three or four years.
 Ireland's high borrowing costs and large deficit have caused
fears of a Greek-style scenario where budget problems in one
country plunge the entire euro zone into crisis, even though its
debt requirements are funded until mid-2011.
 The Irish government has been reluctant to apply for
assistance, partly because it faces a by-election it can ill
afford to lose on Nov. 25 and also because it says it wants to
preserve its sovereignty.
 But the Irish Independent newspaper said the government was
considering asking for money for its banks, a politically less
risky move than asking for a state bailout.
 European Central Bank Vice President Vitor Constancio said
Ireland had been talking to European institutions but there had
not yet been a formal request for assistance.
 ""The Irish state is financed until part of next year, but it
is also a problem of the banks that are at the centre of the
problems in Ireland and considerations have to be pondered,"" he
told a news conference in Vienna.
 Constancio said such help, if needed, could involve the 440
billion euro European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) set up
after Greece was forced to seek help in May.
 EU sources say aid under discussion ranges from 45 billion
to 90 billion euros ($63 billion-$123 billion), depending on
whether Ireland needs support for its banks.
 
 GERMANY CRITICISED
 Ireland and others say Germany has aggravated problems by
pushing the idea of asset value reductions or ""haircuts"" for
private bondholders under a permanent euro zone rescue mechanism
which Berlin wants in place from 2013.
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said Berlin's demand
that banks and bond markets share the pain of a sovereign debt
default could push some euro zone economies towards bankruptcy.
 ""It created a spiral of higher interest rates for countries
that seemed to be in a difficult position, such as Ireland or
Portugal,"" Papandreou said during a visit to Paris.
 ""This could create a self-fulfilling prophecy ... This could
break backs. This could force economies towards bankruptcy.""
 Bank of Spain Governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, a
member of the ECB's governing council, told a banking conference
in Madrid he expected an ""appropriate reaction"" by Ireland to
help calm markets.
 He later told reporters: ""The situation in the markets has
been negative due in some part to the lack of a decision by
Ireland. It's not up to me to make a decision on Ireland, it's
Ireland that should take the decision at the right moment.""
 Ewald Nowotny, another ECB governing council member, said in
a radio interview the EU wanted a ""quick, good solution to
Ireland, so that there will be no spill-over"" to other heavily
indebted countries such as Portugal and Spain.
 Ireland's borrowing costs shot to record highs in the past
week on concerns over a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross
domestic product this year and growing borrowing costs.
 Lenihan has promised to pump up to 50 billion euros ($68
billion) into the banks and has pledged a four-year debt-cutting
plan will be published before the month is out, with a full 2011
budget following early in December.
 But pressure is mounting to produce concrete plans sooner.

 NEW YORK, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose broadly
and government bond yields rose, but stocks were little changed
on Monday after data showed U.S. retail sales posted their
strongest rise in seven months, though investors remained
concerned about European debt problems.
 A rise in 10-year Treasury yields to a three-month high
pushed the dollar, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that
a group of Republican-leaning economists was launching a
campaign calling for the Federal Reserve to drop its plan to
buy $600 billion of Treasuries.
 U.S. data showed sales at U.S. retailers rose more than
expected in October, suggesting the economic recovery was on
track, but a separate report showed a gauge of manufacturing in
New York State fell in November to its lowest since April 2009
after new orders and shipments tumbled. [ID:nN12137914] and
[ID:nN15243086].
 ""The recovery in the dollar had been driven by consistent
surprises in U.S. data over the past two weeks and the
disappointing Empire State survey reminded traders that the
recovery in the U.S. economy is still uneven,"" said Kathy Lien,
director of currency research at GFT in New York.
 But she added that the dollar should recover its initial
losses as consumer spending is the primary driver of the U.S.
economy.
 The dollar index <.DXY> was up 0.44 percent at 78.423 and
has now recouped all losses made after the Fed's Nov. 3
announcement for a second round of quantitative easing.
 The euro  slipped 0.5 percent to $1.3620, while the
dollar gained 0.44 percent to 82.87 yen , after having
earlier touched 83.28 yen on trading platform EBS.
 Investors sold the euro as Ireland struggled to convince
them it was in control of its debt problems, leaving open the
possibility of a bailout. [ID:nLDE68T0MG]
The euro has taken a hit in the past week as Irish bond
yields have jumped on the country's struggles to control its
spiraling debt.
 The debt-laden country is fully funded for 2010, but Irish
press reports on Monday said it was considering asking for
money for its banks, and other European governments were keen
to avoid a contagion to other peripheral countries.
 STOCKS AWAIT DIRECTION
 U.S. stocks were trading steady in positive territory as a
pair of large acquisition proposals was offset by weakness in
Internet shares.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 44.31
points, or 0.40 percent, at 11,236.89. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 3.88 points, or 0.32 percent, at
1,203.09. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 3.87
points, or 0.15 percent, at 2,522.08.
 Caterpillar Inc  agreed to buy mining equipment
maker Bucyrus International Inc  for $7.6 billion,
sending Bucyrus' shares up 29 percent to $89.91. Caterpillar, a
Dow component, rose 0.6 percent to $81.53. For details, see
[ID:nLDE6AE1EV]
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
was up 0.4 percent and Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed up 1.1
percent, near a 4-1/2 month high hit last week, helped by
better-than-expected Japanese growth data for the third
quarter.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> was up
0.1 percent, and their emerging market index was down 0.56
percent.
 Persistent concerns that China will raise interest rates
further also spurred selling of riskier assets as traders
worried policy tightening will curb the world's second-largest
economy's robust demand for commodities and other imports.
 A wide-raging barrage of criticism of the Fed's monetary
policy from countries such as Russia and China to some
Republican lawmakers and economists reinforced the inclination
to sell Treasuries and take profits before yearend, traders
said.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 18/32, with the yield at 2.8491 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was down 1/32, with the yield at
0.5237 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was
down 16/32, with the yield at 4.321 percent.
 The Fed is expected to buy $7 billion in debt maturing in
seven years on Monday. The Fed bought $7.23 billion in Treasury
paper maturing in four to six years on Friday, the first of
$600 billion in asset purchases the U.S. central bank said it
would make to try to boost both employment and inflation.
 In energy and commodities prices, crude oil  rose 46
cents, or 0.54 percent, to $85.34 per barrel, and spot gold
prices  rose $4.67, or 0.34 percent, to $1373.00 an
ounce, steadying after its biggest one-day fall since July 1
the previous session.
 The drop from last week's record $1,424.10 was on concern
the market had become overbought and as talk of a potential
interest rate rise in China knocked commodities sharply lower.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a six-week
high against major currencies on Monday, as rising U.S. bond
yields boosted the appeal of U.S. assets and worries about
Ireland's debt crisis persisted.
 The dollar could stay supported in the near term as markets
focus on problems in the euro zone and investors book profits
on their short dollar bets built up before the Federal
Reserve's decision earlier this month to print more money.
 U.S. Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year yield hitting a
three-month high earlier after the Wall Street Journal reported
that a group of Republican-leaning economists is calling for
the Fed to drop its plan to buy $600 billion of Treasuries.
 The dollar was particularly strong versus the yen, rising
to a near 6-week high above 83.00 yen, as the spread between
U.S. and Japanese benchmark government bonds widened.
 But the dollar pared gains across the board after data
showed a manufacturing gauge in New York state fell this month
to its lowest level since April 2009, which offset a
stronger-than-expected reading of retail sales.
[ID:nN15239736]
 ""The recovery in the dollar had been driven by consistent
surprises in U.S. data over the past 2 weeks and the
disappointing Empire State survey reminded traders that the
recovery in the U.S. economy is still uneven,"" said Kathy Lien,
director of currency research at GFT in New York.
 But she added that the dollar should recover its initial
losses as consumer spending is the primary driver of the U.S.
economy.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the greenback versus
a basket of six currencies, was 0.3 percent higher at 78.309,
having hit a high of 78.562, its strongest since early
October.
 The 10-year Treasury yield's climb took it to a three-month
high around 2.86 percent . Yields also rose after
Richmond Federal Reserve President Jeffrey Lacker indicated
opposition to the central bank's latest round of monetary
easing. [ID:nN14217377]
 ""The market still wants to trade the correlation between
yield spreads and the dollar, especially versus the yen,"" said
Paul Mackel, director of currency strategy at HSBC.
 Mackel at HSBC said higher yields would continue to boost
the dollar. HSBC expects the euro to trade at $1.35 by
year-end.
 EURO SUFFERS
 The euro  slipped 0.3 percent to $1.3644, while the
dollar gained 0.4 percent to 82.81 yen , after having
earlier touched 83.28 yen on trading platform EBS.
 Investors sold the euro as Ireland struggled to convince
investors it was in control of its debt problems, leaving open
the possibility of a bailout. [ID:nLDE68T0MG]
 The single currency has taken a hit in the past week or so
as Irish bond yields have rocketed on the country's struggles
to control its spiraling debt.
 Still, some investors have taken heart from reports that
the European Union has an aid package of up to 90 billion euros
prepared for Dublin, keeping the euro above Friday's six-week
low of $1.3573.
 The euro also had support at its 55-day moving average at
$1.3551, while the dollar index must clear its 55-day average
at 78.97 to extend its rally.
 On Monday the possibility of a bailout lowered the cost of
insuring against an Irish default, while the spread between
Irish 10-year bond yields and their safer, German counterparts
tightened a touch. [GVD/EUR]
 Finance ministers from euro zone states hold monthly talks
on Tuesday and ministers from other EU states join them for
what is called an ECOFIN meeting on Wednesday.
 Some analysts were unconvinced a possible rescue plan for
Ireland would offer much support for the euro, given that other
countries including Portugal are also battling debt problems.

 LISBON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Portugal must convince markets it
is serious about executing the 2011 budget and make it a part of
a credible strategy of fiscal discipline, European Central Bank
governing council member Carlos Costa said on Monday.
 Investor concerns about the ability of euro zone weaklings
like Ireland and Portugal to tackle their large fiscal deficits
and debt have driven their borrowing costs to euro lifetime
highs this month, raising the spectre of a Greek-style bailout.
 ""The impact of the 2011 budget on market confidence will
depend first of all on the demonstration of the will and ability
for its effective execution,"" Costa, who is also Bank of
Portugal governor, told a conference.
 Ireland is under growing pressure to agree to a deal but
Portugal's government has ruled out resorting to foreign aid for
now, saying it will rely on austerity to slash the deficit amd
meet a goal of 4.6 percent for the fiscal gap in 2011.
 Costa said the draft 2011 budget was an ""unprecedented""
effort and its expected final approval later this month is key
for investor confidence. But he reiterated that additional
measures were needed to make public finances sustainable in the
medium term.
 Economists' concerns around Portugal centre around its poor
growth outlook, undermined by a struggle for competitiveness
since it joined the euro at what some say was an overinflated
rate that undermined local business for the longer-term.
 ""The budgetary policy has to be accompanied by other
policies of a structural nature that contribute to increase the
growth potential of the Portuguese economy,"" he said.
 The premium investors demand to hold Portuguese 10-year
bonds rather than German Bunds fell about 10 basis points on
Monday, continuing to retreat from last week's record level of
501 bps.

economists will launch a campaign this week calling on U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to drop his plan to buy
$600 billion more in Treasury bonds, the Wall Street Journal
reported on Monday.
 The Fed's latest policy decision has come under unusually
heavy criticism from Republican lawmakers, and the central bank
is likely to face intense scrutiny when a new Congress is seated
in January.
 ""The planned asset purchases risk currency debasement and
inflation, and we do not think they will achieve the Fed's
objective of promoting employment,"" the WSJ quoted the
economists as saying in a letter to be published as a full-page
advertisement this week.
 The 10-year Treasury yield hit a two-month high, helping the
dollar hit a six-week high against a basket of currencies,
partly in response to the WSJ report.
 The letter was signed by economists including Stanford
University's Michael Boskin, once chairman of former President
George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, and John Taylor,
a monetary policy scholar who served in both Bush
administrations.
 Currently, the Fed appears on track to buy the entire $600
billion in U.S. government debt, barring any big unexpected
shift in the economy's prospects.
 If anything, lingering weakness and renewed concerns about
global credit markets may lead top officials to lean toward
doing more rather than less.
 The independent Fed has already fought off a legislative
effort that would have subjected its monetary policy decisions
to congressional audits, although that proposal could resurface
in the coming year.

 * G20 agreed to monitor effect of Basel III rules
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The industry association for
British banks has joined those asking banking regulators to
revise provisions in new rules of credit affecting trade finance
for fear they could disrupt the funding that is the lifeblood of
global commerce.
 Bankers believe the new Basel III banking rules, intended to
forestall a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, do not take
into account that trade finance is one of the safest forms of
lending.
 In a letter to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
published on Monday on its website, the British Bankers'
Association (BBA) noted the British government and banks had set
up a taskforce to look at trade finance and other questions.
 ""... the taskforce has concluded that customised treatment
of trade finance would better reflect the risk profiles of these
products and increase the capacity of banks to provide them,
which will assist with exports and recovery,"" said the Nov. 12
letter from BBA Chief Executive Angela Knight.
 Leaders of the G20 rich and emerging countries endorsed the
new package of regulations at a summit in Seoul last week but
also agreed to monitor the impact of Basel III on trade finance.
 HSBC Chairman Stephen Green, the former chairman of the BBA,
said in Seoul he was confident Basel would be amended.
 
 LOW DEFAULT RATE
 Governments and the World Trade Organization are concerned
that companies in developing countries are still unable to
access trade finance, vital to keep their exports flowing, and
tough capital rules could discourage banks even further.
 The Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce, which
sets rules for trade finance, recently published the results of
a database of trade finance transactions showing a default rate
of only 0.02 percent.
 The database, funded as a pilot project by the Asian
Development Bank, looked at 5.22 million transactions from nine
leading banks over five years, worth $2.5 trillion.
 In its letter the BBA called on the Basel regulators to use
the actual maturity of trade finance deals -- on average 115
days according to the database -- instead of applying the
one-year maturity floor used for all loans when prescribing how
much capital banks should set aside.
 The current rules do allow national regulators to waive the
maturity floor, but so far only Britain has done so.
 The BBA also urged regulators to use industry data in their
treatment of trade finance instruments, which are typically held
off balance sheets and rarely convert to on-balance-sheet items.
It called for an industry-wide panel of experts to draw on
the expertise of the London banking market to calculate the
appropriate ""conversion factors"" for different trade finance
instruments.
 The letter acknowledged Basel III, which makes it harder for
banks to hide toxic assets, aims to improve regulation to build
a robust financial system critical for economic recovery.
 ""However, the broad strokes of how the new capital, leverage
and liquidity rules will be applied may have significant
unintended consequences on banks' ability to provide these
services and financing at affordable costs to business,"" it
said.

 BRUSSELS, Nov 15 (Reuters) - European businesses are

Earlier this month the euro  hit its highest level
against the dollar since January on market expectations the U.S.
central bank would begin another round of quantitative easing --
printing money to buy bonds in the hope of spurring growth.
 The rise was a concern for exporters in the European Union,
but signs that the EU's economic recovery remains largely
export-driven have mitigated some of the impact, according to
BusinessEurope, a group representing 20 million companies.
 At the same time, European businesses are increasingly
concerned about the inability of the world's leading nations to
address economic imbalances, BusinessEurope said.
 ""The need to uphold global trade, fight protectionism and
implement competitiveness-enhancing reforms in Europe is viewed
as of the highest priority by the business community,""
BusinessEurope said in a statement.
 At a meeting in Seoul last week, G20 leaders agreed to a
watered-down commitment to watch out for dangerous imbalances.
 They promised to move towards market-determined exchange
rates and shun competitive devaluations, addressing concerns
about China's tightly managed yuan and a U.S. monetary policy
that some economists say is aimed at keeping the dollar down.
 BusinessEurope said European companies were worried about
the impact of the Federal Reserve's policies on the euro.
 ""The euro is perhaps the only currency (trading) according
to market rates,"" the group's Director General Philippe de Buck
told reporters.
 The group expects the euro zone economy to grow by 1.6
percent this year and 1.4 percent in 2011, while the EU as a
whole should grow 1.8 percent and 1.7 percent. Germany is seen
growing by 2 percent next year and 3.5 percent in 2010.
 In June, BusinessEurope had forecast the European economy to
expand by 1.1 percent this year, lower than the new forecast.
 It expects unemployment rates to remain unchanged next year
in the single currency area at 10 percent, even though it
expects some 600,000 jobs to be created in 2011.
 Inflation in the euro area is expected to nudge up to 1.6
percent in 2011 from 1.5 percent this year.
 The major risks to growth forecasts, in addition to
protectionist policies, stem from access to raw materials,
commodity prices, insufficient public finance reforms and
potential tax increases, the group said.

 (Updates prices, adds quote)
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The dollar index hit a six-week
high on Monday, boosted by a rise in U.S. Treasury yields that
heightened the appeal of U.S. assets, while the euro was stung
as Ireland's debt problems shook confidence in the euro zone.
 The 10-year Treasury yield hit a three-month high as the
Wall Street Journal reported that a group of Republican-leaning
economists is launching a campaign calling for the Federal
Reserve to drop its plan to buy $600 billion of Treasuries.
 Analysts said the rise in yields gave further reason to buy
the dollar, which has recovered as investors reduce short dollar
positions built up before the Fed's well-flagged decision
earlier this month to begin another bout of quantitative easing.
 Investors also sold the euro as Ireland struggled to
convince investors it was in control of its debt problems,
leaving open the possibility of a bailout. ""There is
evidence of stretched positioning - long positions in U.S.
Treasuries and short positions in the U.S. dollar,"" said Elsa
Lignos, currency strategist at RBC.
 ""Unlike QE1, which came more out of the blue, the market had
a long time to process QE2 and to factor it in"".
 The dollar was particularly strong against the yen, rising
to a near 6-week high above 83.00 yen, supported by a widening
in yield spreads between U.S. and Japanese benchmark government
bonds.
 The dollar index was 0.5 percent higher on the day at
78.472, having hit a high of 78.562, its strongest since early
October. Its gains came as the euro fell 0.5 percent to $1.3627.
 The U.S. currency was boosted as the 10-year Treasury
yield's climb to a three-month high around 2.86 percent
suggested higher returns on U.S. assets.
 Yields also rose after Richmond Federal Reserve President
Jeffrey Lacker indicated opposition to the central bank's latest
round of monetary easing.
 ""The market still wants to trade the correlation between
yield spreads and the dollar, especially versus the yen,"" said
Paul Mackel, director of currency strategy at HSBC.
 Analysts say the Fed's decision to pump liquidity into the
market through Treasury purchases will limit the upside for
yields, but some say investors may trim long Treasury positions
as a slight recovery in U.S. fundamentals suggests the Fed may
not be as aggressive on QE.
 
 EURO SUFFERS
 Mackel at HSBC said higher yields would continue to boost
the dollar. HSBC expects the euro to trade at $1.35 by year-end.
 The single currency has taken a hit in the past week or so
as Irish bond yields have rocketed on the country's struggles to
control its spiralling debt.
 Still, some investors have taken heart from reports that the
European Union has an aid package of up to 90 billion euros
prepared for Dublin, keeping the euro above Friday's six-week
low of $1.3573.
 The euro also had support at its 55-day moving average at
$1.3551, while the dollar index must clear its 55-day average at
78.97 to extend its rally.
 The possibility of a bailout lowered the cost of insuring
against an Irish default on Monday, while the spread between
Irish 10-year bond yields and their safer, German counterparts
tightened a touch.
 However, five-year Irish credit default swaps and the
Irish/German yield spread remain near their widest ever,
suggesting that investors have little faith in Ireland's ability
to repay its debts without assistance.
 Some analysts were unconvinced a possible rescue plan for
Ireland would offer much support for the euro, given that other
countries including Portugal are also battling debt problems.

 KARLSRUHE, Germany, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Europe must see off
risks to the euro and establish a new anchor for financial and
economic stability in the euro zone, Chancellor Angela Merkel
told a German conservative party congress on Monday.
 Merkel, speaking to a rally of her Christian Democratic
Union (CDU) in the southwestern town of Karlsruhe, said it was
essential that the European Union work together to prevent any
further crises of confidence like that in Greece.
 She was speaking as pressure grew on Ireland to agree on an
EU bailout to halt a debt market sell-off and its spread to
other European government borrowers.
 ""Everything is at stake -- if the euro fails, then Europe
will fail,"" Merkel told delegates at the CDU congress.
 ""The idea of European values and unity will have failed, an
idea that gave our continent strength and prosperity after the
last century with its wars and destruction. It's up to us. It's
our task to create a new anchor for a culture of stability in
Europe,"" said the chancellor.
 Merkel, trying to boost her party's slumping fortunes, did
not go into detail about plans for a new euro stability pact nor
did she mention Ireland in particular. [ID:nLDE68T0MG]
 Berlin's push for states to agree on a mechanism that would
allow Europe to deal with future debt crises and potentially
have the private sector share the cost of a debt restructuring
have added to worries for European bond investors.
 ""We've got to prepare for the future so that a crisis won't
ever happen again,"" she said in her 75-minute address.
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said Germany's tough
stance on banks and bond markets sharing the pain of any default
could force some economies toward bankruptcy and had pushed up
interest rates for Ireland and Portugal.
 ""This could create a self-fulfilling prophecy ... This could
break backs. This could force economies towards bankruptcy,""
said Papandreou during a visit to Paris. [ID:nPISFME6FP]
 Merkel attacked her predecessor, Social Democrat Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder and his Finance Minister Hans Eichel, for
allowing Greece into the euro zone. The SPD, now in opposition,
acted irresponsibly, she said.
 ""In 2000 Schroeder and Eichel couldn't let Greece join the
euro fast enough and they ignored all the warnings,"" Merkel
said. ""It was a political decision ... political decisions are
important but those which ignore the facts are irresponsible.""
 She also said Germany, one of the world's leading export
nations, would not accept being punished for its successes.
 Merkel was referring to pressure from the United States for
Germany to reduce its trade and current account surplus and
stimulate domestic demand to help global economic recovery.
 ""We will not allow ourselves to be punished for something
that we do well,"" Merkel said. ""We'll not allow ourselves to be
whipped because we export good products, made in Germany, all
around the world.""

 * Newspaper says Irish may seek emergency funding for banks
 * Dublin says it has not asked for state bailout
 * Greek PM blames Germany for aggravating situation
 
 By Padraic Halpin and Michael Winfrey
 DUBLIN/VIENNA, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Aid would be available for
Ireland's banking sector or the state itself, a top European
policymaker said on Monday after a report suggested Dublin could
seek money for its stricken banks from an EU emergency fund.
 Dublin reiterated that it will not need a bailout from the
European Union or the International Monetary Fund although EU
sources have said talks on a possible bailout are under way and
it is unlikely to hold out without assistance. The Irish
Independent newspaper said Dublin was considering asking for
money for its banks, an option that could be less risky
politically than asking for a bailout of the state.
 It said Finance Minister Brian Lenihan could raise the issue
this week in Brussels. Finance ministers from euro zone states
hold monthly talks on Tuesday and ministers from other EU states
join them for what is called an ECOFIN meeting on Wednesday.
 European Central Bank Vice President Vitor Constancio said
aid would be available whether it was for Ireland's banks or the
state and confirmed talks were under way.
 ""The Irish state is financed until part of next year, but it
is also a problem of the banks that are at the centre of the
problems in Ireland and considerations have to be pondered,"" he
told a news conference in Vienna.
 ""There has been dialogue with European institutions ... but
so far no formal request,"" he said.
 Constancio said such help, if needed, could involve the 440
billion euro European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) set up
after Greece was forced to seek help in May.
 The EU wants Ireland to accept aid, sources have said, to
avert a Greek-style scenario where budget problems in one
country plunge the entire euro zone into crisis -- even though
its debt requirements are funded until mid-2011.
 ""Unless Irish spreads compress considerably in the near
term, we believe that an EU-IMF programme could become
necessary,"" Barclays Capital Research said.
 
 GERMANY CRITICISED
 Ireland -- and others -- says Germany has aggravated
problems by pushing the idea of asset value reductions or
""haircuts"" for private bondholders under a permanent euro zone
rescue mechanism it wants in place from 2013.
 Germany, the EU's chief paymaster, has said it is not
exerting pressure on Ireland to accept aid now.
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said Berlin's demand
that banks and bond markets share the pain of a sovereign debt
default could force some euro zone economies toward bankruptcy.
 ""It created a spiral of higher interest rates for countries
that seemed to be in a difficult position, such as Ireland or
Portugal,"" Papandreou said during a visit to Paris.
 ""This could create a self-fulfilling prophecy ... This could
break backs. This could force economies towards bankruptcy.""
 Such has been the market turmoil the leaders of France,
Germany, Italy, Spain and Britain issued a statement at a G20
summit in Seoul last week, confirming that holders of existing
euro debt would not take a hit.
 ""We expect an appropriate reaction by the Irish authorities
-- as well as the clarification by the ministers ... (will) help
to calm markets,"" Bank of Spain Governor Miguel Angel Fernandez
Ordonez said.
 Ireland's borrowing costs shot to record highs in the past
week on concerns over a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross
domestic product this year and spiralling borrowing costs.
 The cost of insuring Irish debt against default fell on
Monday, and the yield on premium 10-year Irish government bonds
above benchmark German government bonds dropped, but pressure on
Dublin remained strong.
 It has not ruled out the possibility it may have to seek
help but says no application has been made for assistance.
 Lenihan has promised to pump up to 50 billion euros ($68
billion) into the banks and has promised a four-year
debt-cutting plan will be published before the month is out,
with a full 2011 budget following early in December.
 But pressure is mounting to produce concrete plans sooner.
 Irish Junior Minister for European Affairs Dick Roche said
""continuous talks"" were under way on the level of Ireland's debt
but talk of a bailout was irresponsible.
 ""The argument that Ireland is about to go banging on the
door of the IMF or needs to go to go into the EU bailout is
simply wrong but if it gets more legs, it could be very, very
dangerous,"" Roche told Newstalk radio.
 EU sources say aid under discussion ranges from 45
billion-90 billion euros ($63 billion-$123 billion), depending
on whether Ireland needs support for its banks.
 Some banks, such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Germany's
Hypo, are heavily exposed to Irish sovereign debt and Dublin may
have no choice but to seek aid if it comes under renewed attack
in financial markets.

 * Asian central banks, real money accounts buy pound
(Adds details about flows, updates prices)
 
 LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Sterling fell against a broadly
firmer U.S. dollar on Monday but hovered near seven-week highs
against the struggling euro as uncertainty over whether Ireland
would require emergency funding hurt the single currency.
 The dollar extended its gains from last week, buoyed by a
sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields and a report that a group of
prominent Republican-leaning economists was launching a campaign
calling on the Federal Reserve to drop its quantitative easing
plan.
 The dollar index hit a six-week high while the 10-year U.S.
Treasury yield rose to its highest in two months and the
five-year yield rose more than 10 basis points.
 This helped the greenback and drove sterling 0.5 percent
lower for the day to $1.6055. Sterling had fallen as low as
$1.6042, with traders citing stop-loss orders triggered at
$1.6060 and at $1.6050.
 Traders said Russian speculators sold cable, while buying by
Asian central banks and real money accounts tempered these
losses.
 ""Cable is under pressure because of the rising U.S. dollar,
which is getting support from rising yields,"" said Adrian
Schmidt, FX strategist at Lloyds TSB Financial Markets. ""We see
a fair bit of resistance at $1.6150/80 levels.""
 The pound hit an intra-day high of $1.6185 on Nov. 12 and a
peak of $1.6183 on Nov. 9 before retreating, indicating it was
struggling to break that area convincingly.
 A raft of UK economic numbers is due this week along with
the minutes of the Bank of England monetary policy meeting for
November. Analysts will scour the minutes for clues about the
likelihood and timing of any further asset purchases.
 Recent UK data has surprised to the upside, lessening the
likelihood of more easing in the near term. Inflation numbers on
Tuesday and jobs data on Wednesday should make it clearer
whether the economy needs a further dose of stimulus.
 The pound should then be well-supported against the
struggling euro, traders said.
 The euro was marginally lower against the pound at 84.80
pence, close to a seven-week low of 84.50 pence struck on
Friday. It fell as low as 84.64 with stops at 84.65 triggered,
dealers said.
 Traders said there was good support for the euro around
84.50, close to its 100-day moving average that comes in at
84.54 on Monday.
 The euro was subdued at $1.3630, giving up earlier gains
made on hopes of an EU aid package for Ireland. Media reports on
Monday said Ireland was considering asking for money for its
banks from the EU's emergency fund in a bid to fend off the
threat of a bailout for the state.
 EU sources told Reuters over the past two days that talk of
a possible bailout were under way and that Ireland, with its
borrowing costs rising, was unlikely to hold out.
 ""The single currency is finding a degree of support around
0.8450,"" said Michael Hewson, market analyst at CMC Markets.
""Pullbacks should remain limited to around the 200-day moving
average around 0.8580, and at the very most 0.8620.""

 By Michel Rose
 London, Nov 15 (Reuters) - European shares shrugged off
early losses and Wall Street look set to open higher on Monday
as investors anticipated Ireland would seek help to manage its
debts, easing fears about the stability of the euro zone.
 A rise in 10-year Treasury yields pushed the dollar up as
the Wall Street Journal reported that a group of
Republican-leaning economists was launching a campaign calling
for the Federal Reserve to drop its plan to buy $600 billion of
Treasuries.
 The dollar index has now recouped all losses made after the
Fed's Nov. 3 announcement for a second round of quantitative
easing.
 The euro was hovering near a six-week low against the dollar
as speculation grew over the weekend that Ireland could turn to
Europe for assistance, but Germany's benchmark bund prices were
sharply lower, as safe-heaven flows were unwound.
 ""The main worry for the market is whether the sovereign debt
crisis will flare out of control and whether it will be
contained,"" Bernard McAlinden, investment strategist at NCB
Stockbrokers in Dublin, said.
 The euro was the most hit amongst major currencies, falling
0.6 percent against the dollar to 1.3625, while sterling was
down 0.3 percent to $1.6088 and the yen rose 0.5 percent to
82.86.
 Irish bond yields fell from last week's peak and the cost of
insuring the country's debt against default fell on the day,
according to data monitor Markit, on expectation Ireland would
give in to the pressure from its peers and the market.
 The debt-laden country is fully funded for 2010, but Irish
press reports on Monday said it was considering asking for money
for its banks, and other European governments were keen to avoid
a contagion to other peripheral countries.
 
 MIXED SHARES
 European shares were flat and Japan's Nikkei closed up 1.1
percent, near a 4-1/2 month high hit last week, helped by
better-than-expected Japanese growth data for the third quarter.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index was down a quarter of a
percent, and their emerging market index was down 0.64 percent.
 Persistent concerns that China will raise interest rates
further also spurred selling of riskier assets as traders
worried policy tightening will curb the world's second-largest
economy's robust demand for commodities and other imports.

 LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - German government bond prices
fell sharply on Monday and Ireland's rose as some safe-haven
flows were unwound in anticipation that Dublin could ask the
European Union for aid to manage its debt crisis.
 Ireland did not rule out on Sunday the possibility that it
may have to turn to Europe but said that no application had been
made for assistance yet. [ID:nLDE68T0MG] 
 The premium 10-year Irish government bonds yield above
benchmark Bunds was 18 basis points lower at 570 bps, down from
a peak above 665 bps last week, but outright 10-year yields
 remained at levels above 8 percent that are seen
as unsustainable.
 ""If they get the funding earlier, it's a positive for the
market, it takes away some of the tail risks and the downgrades
needn't be as aggressive,"" said RBS rate strategist Harvinder
Sian. 
 ""It's political suicide to hand over the keys to your

Portuguese 10-year yield spreads  were steady
around 443 bps, but off highs set last week, with Lisbon seen as
the next most likely to need assistance after Ireland.
 ""The biggest question is where the whole EMU sovereign debt
crisis ends up, with the risk being that forcing Ireland into a
rescue of some description would leave the market to focus on
the next weakest link, and on the crisis goes,"" ING rate
strategist Padhraic Garvey said.
 Meanwhile, Greece said its 2010 deficit will be 9.4 percent
of GDP, a reduction of 6 percentage points [ID:nATH005802].
 At 1120 GMT, December Bund futures  were 47 ticks
lower at 128.94, their lowest in 2-1/2 weeks.
 Two-year German yields  were up half a basis
point at 1.042 percent, with 10-year yields  up 3.5
bps at 2.551 percent.
 
 U.S. YIELDS
 A slide in U.S. Treasuries also weighed on Bunds after
Richmond Federal Reserve President Jeffrey Lacker indicated he
opposed the central bank's new round of monetary easing
[ID:nN14217377] and the Wall Street Journal reported the Fed's
asset-purchase programme was coming under fire from Republican
economists and politicians.
 ""Obviously the pressure is on Ireland to do something and
that's Bund negative but Treasuries and JGBs are under pressure
so it's coming all ways,"" a trader said.
 Should Ireland, or even Portugal request aid, the European
Financial Stability Facility would issue triple-A rated bonds
guaranteed by the euro zone members [ID:nLDE65718H].
 Societe Generale said that if both Ireland and Portugal were
to request aid, the EFSF would probably have to issue more than
100 billion euros over three years, with around 30 billion in
the first year.
 ""These (EFSF) bonds would appeal to sovereign wealth funds
and overseas investors who find the European situation a bit
confusing, but the issuance size put in context would be very
small, compared with total euro zone sovereign issuance,"" the
bank's economist James Nixon said.
 The bank said the bonds would likely be priced around the
same levels as those paid by the European Investment Bank, and
Nixon added that they may rank senior to the individual
government's bonds in the event of a restructuring.
 ""We're building a clear structure where supranationals and
governments are preferred creditors and it's fairly clear that
any losses are expected to be incurred by the private sector,
i.e. banks,"" he said.
 ""That remains a huge structural negative for the euro zone
banking sector.""

 (Corrects second graph to ""fundamentally misplaced""
criticism of QE2)
 By Steven Scheer
 JERUSALEM, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Rising inflation expectations
remain a concern for policymakers but they do not have to be
dealt with immediately, Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer
said on Monday.
 Fischer also dismissed as ""fundamentally misplaced"" the
criticism of a decision by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Ben
Bernanke to buy hundreds of millions of dollars worth of assets.
 Fischer, who was Bernanke's thesis adviser, said a temporary
weakening of the U.S. currency was worth boosting growth of the
world's largest economy.
 Israeli inflation hit a 2.4 percent annual rate in September
and is expected to move to about 3 percent in the next year to
reach the top of a government target of 1-3 percent.
 ""That's a matter of concern and we will watch it closely,""
Fischer told reporters. ""We will have to react at some point but
it's not a concern that we will have to deal with immediately.""
 The Bank of Israel has already raised its benchmark rate by
1.5 percentage points to 2 percent since August 2009 to quell
higher inflation stemming from surging housing prices.
 The last rate increase was on Sept. 27.
 ""We don't want to establish an automatic link where
expectations of inflation rise in the market and the Bank of
Israel responds with the need to start raising interest rates,""
Fischer said in a conference call.
 He said the housing market remains the key risk to Israel's
economy since further gains in housing prices could lead to a
bubble and it could ultimately burst. Fischer believes more
allocation of supply is still the best way to lower prices than
the Bank of Israel raising rates and using other steps.
 Israel's economy, he said, was growing a very respectable
growth rate of a little less than 4 percent, fuelled largely by
strong domestic demand while exports have turned negative.
Exports comprise more than 40 percent of economic activity.
 ""If the global economy remains weak, we will have to base
our economy more on domestic activity,"" Fischer said, adding
that the decline in exports will result in a narrower current
account surplus in Israel's balance of payments.
 He noted that with countries -- such as the United States
and some in Europe -- representing 70 percent of Israeli exports
were growing more slowly than expected exporters need to
increase sales to Asia, Latin America and Africa.
 
 BACKS BERNANKE
 Fischer hinted that many countries around the world were
hypocritical in their criticism of Bernanke's decision to buy up
to $600 billion of U.S. debt in what is called quantitative
easing II (QE2).
 ""This (criticism) is fundamentally misplaced,"" said Fischer,
adding that the U.S. economy was growing slowly, unemployment
was high and there was no chance to use fiscal policy to get the
economy to grow faster.
 ""If I had to choose ... with having to deal with a situation
in which the U.S. is growing more rapidly and management of our
exchange rate is more complicated and another situation where
the U.S. economy continues to grow more slowly and we don't have
a problem keeping the exchange rate at the level we like, I
would rather have the main engine of growth of the largest
economy in the world growing,"" Fischer said.
 The Bank of Israel has bought tens of billions of dollars
the last 2-1/2 years to keep the shekel  from appreciating
too much and damaging Israeli exports and the economy. It bought
$3.375 billion in October as the shekel has moved to a two-year
peak versus the dollar.
 Fischer believes the dollar's global weakness is temporary.
 ""There is some devaluation,"" he said. ""But it's something
that will go away as QE2 takes hold and as the U.S. economy
returns to growth.""
 Once there are signs of inflation pressures in the United
States, the Fed can reverse its actions by selling assets ""and
that would be a sign of success of the Fed's policies,"" he said.

 ATHENS, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Greece promised on Monday to
stick to its deficit cutting plan while its prime minister said
Germany's tough stance may push debt-laden European nations such
as Portugal and Ireland to bankruptcy.
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said Germany's

share the pain of any euro zone sovereign debt default from 2013
could break some EU economies.
 ""This could break backs. This could force economies towards
bankruptcy,"" Papandreou said during a visit to Paris.
 Bond yield spreads of deficit-ridden nations such as Greece,
Ireland and Portugal have soared since German Chancellor Angela
Merkel last month kicked off a debate about a debt restructuring
mechanism for troubled euro zone nations, although EU finance
ministers have since said it would not apply to existing bonds.
 ""It created a spiral of higher interest rates for countries
that seemed to be in a difficult position, such as Ireland or
Portugal,"" Papandreou said. ""This could create a self-fulfilling
prophecy.""
 Ireland on Sunday did not rule out turning to the European
Union for help as its officials hold discussions with European
counterparts..
 The euro zone's debt crisis erupted last year, when
Papandreou's government revealed that his country's finances
were in much worse shape than previously expected.
 On Monday, the EU's statistics agency Eurostat revised
upwards Greece's 2009 deficit for a third time, to 15.4 percent
of GDP compared with a previous 13.6 percent estimate.
 
 SPECTRE OF DEBT RESTRUCTURING
 Greece's finance ministry said it would still manage to
bring the shortfall below the eurozone's 3 percent of GDP
ceiling in 2014, despite the revision, starting with a 6-point
cut this year to 9.4 percent of GDP.
 Greece's debt is now seen swelling to 144 percent of GDP
this year from 126.8 percent of GDP in 2009. Under previous
estimates published last month in the country's 2011 draft
budget, the debt figure was supposed to rise to 133 percent of
GDP this year from 115 percent of GDP in 2009.
 The revised figures suggest that Greece will find it hard to
avoid a debt restructuring, some analysts said.
 ""I believe we are getting closer to a debt restructuring...
I think it is rather unlikely that Greece will make it without
one,"" said Burkhard Allgeier, an economist at German bank Hauck
& Aufhaeuser.
 EU and IMF officials arrived in Athens for an inspection
visit of the country's finances on Monday. Greece is expected to
announce new spending cuts of about 4.5 billion euros in its
2011 budget later this week, to comply with its fiscal
consolidation plan under its 110-billion euro bailout.
 ""These new measures should ensure that the government
receives its third tranche of funds in late November or early
December, but they will prolong the recession,"" said Ben May, an
analyst at Capital Economics in a note.
 Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reiterated on
Monday her strong backing for the euro, saying the European
Union would fail if the euro were to fail.
 Analysts said Greece's woes could make the IMF/EU bailout
plan even more difficult to implement.
 ""That Greece will miss its (2010 deficit) target will spell
difficulties for the IMF and the EU,"" said Christoph Weil, an
economist at Commerzbank in a note. ""Greece mismanaged its
finances even worse than assumed.""

 By Nigel Davies
 MADRID, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Bank of Spain Governor Miguel
Angel Fernandez Ordonez said on Monday pressure on markets was
partly down to indecision by Ireland over its debt situation,
which he expected the country to resolve in an ""appropriate""
manner.
 In Dublin, the Irish government reiterated it would not need
a Greek-style debt bailout but faced continued pressure to seek
outside aid after reports suggested it could ask for money for
its stricken banks from an EU emergency fund. [ID:nLDE6AE0HO]
 ""We expect an appropriate reaction by the Irish authorities
... to help to calm markets and quell unfounded worries,""
Fernandez Ordonez said in a speech to a banking conference in
Madrid.
 After the speech he told reporters: ""The situation in the
markets has been negative due in some part to the lack of a
decision by Ireland. It's not up to me to make a decision on
Ireland, it's Ireland that should take the decision at the right
moment.""
 Clarification by euro zone ministers at last week's G20
meeting of the European Union's resolution mechanisms for debt
crises would also help quell market tensions, he said in the
speech.
 German government bond prices fell sharply on Monday as some
safe-haven flows were unwound on anticipation Ireland could ask
the European Union for aid. [ID:nLDE6AE08E]
 One analyst said that, along with other EU states, Spain was
anxious to see a rescue package for Ireland.
 ""It seems that the whole of the EU, not just Spain, wants
Ireland to access the (bailout) fund as soon as possible,
because when Greece asked for a rescue package markets calmed,""
said Nicolas Lopez, head of analysis at M&G Valores.
 ""(But) we have to bear in mind that Ireland could show some
resistance because asking for a rescue package implies some loss
of sovereignty.""

 BANK ADJUSTMENT
 Fernandez Ordonez said markets were beginning to understand
that any new EU debt crisis resolution mechanism would not take
effect until mid-2013.
 He also urged Spanish banks to speed up their process of
restructuring.
 ""Banks should not forget that markets judge in relative
terms. We have seen in it in the case of sovereign debt, and as
such (Spanish banks) should not only increase their financial
strength and profitability, but do it at the same speed as their
competitors,"" he said.
 He warned that banks' bad and doubtful loans rise in coming
months though the worst of the adjustment in the sector had
already been seen.
 The level of non-performing loans as a ratio of total
lending by Spain's financial sector -- including banks,
financial co-operatives and retail credit cards -- rose to 5.62
percent in August from 5.47 percent a month earlier.
 ""The most important challenges that the Spanish banking
sector faces ... come ... from their own vulnerabilities, those
derived from 14 years of growth based on growing indebtedness
obtained outside our borders.""
 The governor said Spain's main objective was to consolidate
its economic recovery and reach a sustainable growth rate that
would create jobs.
 He said that would be helped by savings banks and other
lenders continuing to provide credit to growth areas. though
they too needed to see a recovery in the wider economy too.
 The key spread between German 10-year bunds and Spanish
ten-year debt held close to 200 basis points on Monday, down
from a high over 230 bps hit last week.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The dollar index hit a six-week
high on Monday, boosted by higher U.S. Treasury yields, while
the euro was stung as Ireland's deepening debt problems shook
confidence in the euro zone.
 The 10-year Treasury yield hit a two-month high as the Wall
Street Journal reported that a group of Republican-leaning
economists is launching a campaign calling for the Federal
Reserve to drop its plan to buy $600 billion of Treasuries.
 That prompted more short-covering in the dollar, which had
been sold aggressively as investors bet the Fed would print
hundreds of billions of dollars to shore up the economy.
 Analysts believe the Federal Reserve's recent announcement
to implement more quantitative easing will limit upside for
Treasury yields, but they added that speculators saw higher
yields as a green light to buy the dollar.
 ""There's definitely a limited upside to U.S. yields given
QE, but their rise has contributed to a higher dollar,"" said
Carl Hammer, chief currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 The euro hovered near a six-week low hit late last week,
having taken a hit as Irish bond yields have rocketed on the
country's struggles to control its spiralling debt.
 Dublin has not applied for EU debt assistance yet, but it
has not ruled out doing so. This has threatened to plunge the
entire euro zone into another crisis of confidence.
 Still, some investors have taken heart from reports that the
European Union has an aid package of up to 90 billion euros
prepared for Dublin, which has helped stem a flight-to-quality
rally in Treasuries, pushing yields higher.
 The dollar index, which tracks the dollar's value against a
currency basket, rose roughly half a percent on the day to
78.513, its highest in roughly six weeks.

 MORE EURO LOSSES?
 By 0901 GMT, the euro had fallen 0.4 percent to the day's
low around $1.3620.
 It hovered near the $1.3573 it hit on Friday, its lowest
since late September. Some analysts were unconvinced a possible
rescue plan for Ireland would offer much support for the euro,
given that other countries including Portugal are also battling
debt problems.
 ""EUR/USD found some support on rumours of an Irish rescue
deal ... but there is still sufficient risk to discourage an
immediate return to long EUR positions,"" ING analysts said in a
note.
 UBS analysts said the euro was vulnerable to more losses if
Ireland does not accept EU funding this week, adding the single
currency would likely be sold on rallies in the short term.
 The U.S. currency was boosted across the board as the
10-year Treasury yield's climb to a two-month high around 2.84
percent suggested higher returns on U.S. assets.
 Yields rose also as Richmond Federal Reserve President
Jeffrey Lacker indicated opposition to the central bank's latest
round of monetary easing.
 The dollar rose 0.5 percent to 82.92 yen, while it also
gained versus the Australian and New Zealand currencies.

 PORT LOUIS, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Mauritius luxury hotel group
Sun Resorts sank to a nine-month loss for the period ended
September 30, stung by a strong rupee and aggressive price
discounting across the sector, the firm said on Monday.
 The group posted a 92.66 million rupee ($3.1 million) loss
for the first three quarters of the year compared with a 85.09
million rupee profit in the year ago period.
 Earnings per share fell to -0.58 rupees compared with 0.88 a
year ago. At 0735 GMT, Sun Resorts' share price was unchanged on
Friday's closing price of 57.00 rupees. 
 ""Trading conditions remain challenging as the market is
still in a transition period, characterised by last minute
bookings, over-supply of rooms and appetite for promotional
packages,"" the group said in a financial statement.
 Mauritius's tourism sector, a key driver of the economy and
important source of foreign exchange, has suffered at the hands
of a slower than expected recovery in its core European markets.
 Sun Resorts said the third quarter, during which it made a
pretax loss of 161.30 million rupees, was particularly
challenging.
 The rupee appreciated 13 percent and 9 percent against the
euro and pound sterling respectively compared with the
corresponding period last year, representing a shortfall of 29
million rupees for the quarter.
 The group said fourth-quarter bookings for four star resorts
were strong but noted a slower trend for the upmarket resorts.
 ""We therefore expect results for the last quarter to be
close to the same quarter of last year.""

 By Ian Chua
 SYDNEY, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Stocks in Asia and Europe fell
on Monday on fears that Ireland may be forced to seek a
financial rescue package, while a jump in U.S. Treasury yields
helped drive the dollar higher.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares
<.FTEU3> shed 0.6 percent in early trade, following most Asian
equity markets lower, as worries about eurozone debt problems
intensifed.
 Irish officials have not ruled out the possibility it may
have to turn to Europe for help in dealing with its debt

 The Irish Independent reported on Monday that Ireland was
considering asking for money for its banks from the European
Union's emergency fund in a bid to fend off the threat of a
bailout for the state. [ID:nLDE6AE094]
 Investors also dumped U.S. Treasuries on renewed criticism
of the Federal Reserve's latest stimulus programme, sending the
five-year Treasury note yield  up about 10 basis
points to two-month highs at 1.48 percent.
 Richmond Federal Reserve President Jeffrey Lacker indicated
he opposed the central bank's new round of monetary easing,
saying he believed the policy was potentially dangerous and
likely ineffective. [ID:nN14217377]
 ""That looks to be the initial catalyst that sparked the
selloff (in Treasuries), and then it ran into quite a few stops
and became momentum and flow driven,"" said Sue Trinh, currency
strategist at RBC in Hong Kong.
 Persistent concerns that Bejing will raise interest rates
further also spurred selling of riskier assets as traders
worried policy tightening will curb China's robust demand for
commodities and other imports.
 Reversing earlier gains, the MSCI index of Asia Pacific
stocks outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> fell 0.7 percent to lows
not seen since Nov. 1. On Friday, the index slid 1.9 percent to
post its biggest one-day percentage fall since late June on
worries that China may have to hike rates more aggressively to
contain a jump in inflation.
 Markets drew no comfort from the G20 and APEC meetings,
which left leaders of the world's most powerful economies
little closer to agreeing on how to prevent fresh crises.
 

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> slipped 0.1 percent,
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index <.HSI> shed 0.8 percent while a
volatile Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> rose 1 percent, after
last Friday's 5.2 percent slide.
 Japan's Nikkei average <.N225> bucked the downdraft,
however, ending 1.1 percent higher as exporters such as Canon
Inc <7751.T> benefited from a weaker yen and as data showing
Japan's economic growth accelerated in the third quarter
spurred investors to buy on dips.
 U.S. YIELDS CLIMB
 The dollar reversed losses against a basket of major
currencies as U.S. Treasury yields rose across the curve.
 RBC's Trinh said the rise in yields prompted dollar short
covering, helping the dollar rise 0.3 percent <.DXY> against a
basket of currencies.
 This saw the dollar climb to five-week highs against the
Japanese currency near 83 yen , and the euro  slip
back below $1.3700. Commodity currencies such as the Australian
dollar erased earlier gains.
 ""There's speculation that the Fed may have to scale back
its asset purchase,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 Further hurt by renewed pressure on commodity prices, the
Aussie dollar  retreated to $0.9833 from a session high
around $0.9900. It has fallen some 3.5 percent from a 28-year
high around $1.0182 set last week.
 On the London Metal Exchange (LME), benchmark copper
 lost 1 percent to $8,530 a tonne, extending Friday's 3
percent slide. Gold  was little changed at $1,366 an
ounce, but off a one-week low of $1,359.70 seen on Friday.
 U.S. crude oil  was flat at $85 a barrel, down about
4 percent from a 25-month high of $88.63 hit last Thursday.

context in paragraph 4.)
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Whether it is just an opportunity
to correct recent market patterns or something more deeply
bearish, investors have decided that a period of avoiding risk
is in order.
 As a result, the combination of the Group of 20 nations
being unable to solve their disagreements over global imbalances
and resurfacing fears about the euro zone periphery's ability to
manage its debt could mean the coming week will be volatile.
 A lot may depend on whether European Union officials do
anything to ease pressure on Ireland's finances. Markets swung
around on Friday on rumours of a bailout, later denied, so the
EU finance ministers meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday should
get even more attention than usual.
 Ireland on Sunday did not rule out turning to Europe for
help but said no application for aid had been made yet.
 But even beyond that, the risk rally that began in May and
took off in earnest in late August when investors began
preparing for more quantitative easing asset-buying from the
Federal Reserve has come off the boil in recent days.
 The MSCI all-country world stock index has lost a little
more than 2 percent since hitting 26-month highs on Nov. 5,
though it is still 22 percent higher than in May at the height
of the Greek crisis and 16 percent above where it was when more
Fed QE started to be factored in.
 Those kinds of levels are often enough in themselves to
trigger sell-offs, and it is perhaps not surprising that some
tactical re-allocations have taken place.
 At the same time, the dollar has been generally stronger
over the past week or so as risk appetite has eased. ""We have
taken some risk off,"" said John Stopford, head of fixed income
at Investec Asset Management.
 ""We have been quite short dollars and we have bought some
back,"" he said.
 
 BIG AND LITTLE
 The mood has nonetheless been compounded by two factors that
moved into the limelight when the Fed went ahead with its QE,
allowing investors to start focusing on other things.
 First, G20 leaders have spent a lot of time in the past week
reminding investors about the large imbalances in the world
economy, while failing to do much about them.
 They agreed to a watered-down commitment to watch out for
dangerous imbalances, but only after some acrimony.
 As a result, concerns over whether the United States is
deliberately devaluing the dollar to boost its trade and whether
China should let the yuan strengthen remain in place.
 That could prompt emerging market countries to ramp up
capital controls or countries to indulge in protectionist trade
practices, all of which could eventually impact current
investment flows from deficit countries to surplus ones.
 But not immediately, of course.
 Which leads to the second big factor hovering over markets
as the new week starts -- euro zone debt, particularly
Ireland's.
 Irish government bonds have been under intense pressure as
investors have speculated whether the debt-strapped country,
which is fully funded until mid-2011, will have enough money to
keep going and/or pay its obligations.
 Yields fell on Friday after EU leaders reiterated that
holders of outstanding bonds would not be forced to take losses
in any debt restructuring in the bloc. Ireland also insists that
it does not need to apply for EU/International Monetary Fund
assistance.
 But the issue shows no sign of disappearing, and although
contagion has been highly limited so far there are concerns that
jitters will spread to other peripheral EU economies and beyond,
as was the case during the Greek crisis earlier this year.
 ""The Irish thing is noise (but) is definitely a concern,""
Investec's Stopford said. ""It may not come to a head that
quickly. It is not going to go away.""
 
 FUNDAMENTALS
 What may stop Ireland from dragging financial markets into
another global crisis are the improved economic fundamentals
that exist now compared with earlier in the year.
 ""The renewed debt crisis will have no serious impact on euro
zone growth,"" Holger Schmieding, chief economist for wealth
managers and private bank Berenberg, said in a note.
 ""Remember that, while the Greek and euro crises raged
earlier this year, the euro zone economy had managed to
accelerate.""
Investors have been generally pleased by recent global
economic data, from China, the United States and the euro zone.
It has been part of the momentum behind the post-summer rally.
The coming week will tell them about U.S. housing, German
business confidence, British employment and how much demand
there is for Spanish debt, among other events.

 * Rise in U.S. yields spurs dollar buyback
 * Worries over Ireland persist, eyes on eurogroup meeting
 * Dollar/yen hits 5-week high, meets Japan exporters offers
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The dollar rose in choppy trade
marred by thin liquidity on Monday, hitting a five-week high
against the Japanese yen, as U.S. bond yields soared.
 The Wall Street Journal reported that a group of prominent
Republican-leaning economists, working with Republican lawmakers
and political strategists, is launching a campaign calling on
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to drop his plan to buy
$600 billion of U.S. Treasuries.
 The report helped push up U.S. bond yields sharply, with the
10-year yield hitting a two-month high and the five-year yield
rising more than 10 basis points.
 That in turn prompted further short-covering in the dollar,
which had been sold aggressively as investors bet the Fed would
print hundreds of billions of dollars to shore up the economy.
 ""There's speculation that the Fed may have to scale back its
asset purchase,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 The euro slipped 0.1 percent to $1.3676, giving up earlier
gains to as high as $1.3751 made on hopes of an EU aid package
for Ireland.
 It fell to a six-week low of $1.3573 on Friday before
recovering on talk of EU aid for the country.
 Ireland did not rule out the possibility that it may have to
turn to Europe for help in dealing with its debt crisis but said
that no application had been made for assistance yet. Euro zone
finance ministers meet in Brussels on Tuesday.
 Still, the market is also watching other euro zone economies
and is nervous about a prospective tightening in China.
 ""Sentiment remains fragile as European bond concerns taken
together with worries about monetary tightening in China have
resulted in risk appetite declining,"" wrote Mitul Kotecha, global
head of FX strategy at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.
 ""If Ireland does not accept EU funding this week the euro
could see itself quickly in trouble again and the currency is
likely to be sold on rallies up to $1.3826 in the short term.""
 Trade has been choppy because of thin liquidity in markets,
traders also said.
 ""There are not many orders on both sides. Market liquidity is
thinner than usual and prices could move easily if there is a big
order,"" said Katsunori Kitakura, chief dealer at Chuo Mitsui
Banking Corp.
 On the charts, the euro had major resistance at $1.3825/35,
intraday highs in the middle of last week, and one dealer said if
it could push above $1.38 then there might be scope for a rise
back to $1.40, but it was likely to be capped there.
 On the downside, it has support at its 55-day moving average
at $1.3552 and needs a weekly close above its 100-week moving
average, now at $1.3640, not to send a bearish signal.
 The dollar gained 0.5 percent to 82.90 yen, hitting a
five-week peak of 82.98 and breaking above its 55-day moving
average for the first time since early June.
 The dollar/yen's advance could continue as traders try to
trigger stop-loss buy orders that are said to be lurking at 83.00
and 83.20 yen, though selling by Japanese exporters could hamper
its rise, traders said.
 AUSSIE DROP
 The Australian dollar dropped to a two-week low of $0.9812,
having lost more than 3 percent in the past week as traders take
profits in the Aussie.
 Investor appetite for risk took a hit on Friday on speculation
China would have to tighten policy further to curb inflation.
If that happens, it could ultimately cool the economy and China's
demand for commodities.
 Analysts noted the same fears abounded earlier in the year
only for the Chinese economy to surprise with its resilience,
but the latest bout of worries served as an excuse to take
profits on leveraged positions in commodities.
 Gold and oil prices stablised on Monday but the price of zinc
and lead fell sharply, which some traders said triggered more
selling in the Australian dollar.

 * Says to ship at 4,000 tonnes of semi-finished nickel
 * Sales temporary until Vale repairs Goro refinery
(Adds quotes and background)
 By James Regan
 NOUMEA, New Caledonia, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Brazil's Vale
unveiled plans on Monday to start shipping nickel from its
troubled $4.3 billion project in New Caledonia, two years
behind original schedule and only in semi-finished form.
 A senior Vale executive said the Goro project would ship at
least 4,000 tonnes of semi-finished metal to Australia from
next month, but he stressed that Vale was sticking to its
long-term goal of ramping up Goro to 58,000 tonnes a year.
 ""This will be a temporary measure for a minimum of 4,000
tonnes,"" Peter Poppinga, Vale's executive vice-president of
base metals, told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry
conference.
 ""The longer-term plan is to produce our own metal...We
didn't spend more than $4 billion just to sell an intermediate
product.""
 Vale is eager to show that its Goro project, which mines
and processes nickel from laterite ores, will avoid the same
fate as earlier nickel laterite projects built in Australia by
miners BHP Billiton and Minara Resources.
 BHP Billiton shut its $2.2 billion Ravensthorpe project
early last year, though it later sold it for $340 million to
Canada's First Quantum Minerals which plans to revive the
project.
 The Minara project, a pioneer of the nickel laterite
process, has yet to reach its annual design capacity of 40,000
tonnes.
 Nickel laterite ores require high-pressure, acid-leach
processing which can make equipment prone to break-downs.
 Vale is making some repairs to its Goro refinery, still
under construction, and industry analysts say it could take
another five years to reach its maximum annual production rate
of 58,000 tonnes of nickel and 4,000 tonnes of cobalt.
 'RAMP-UP ON SCHEDULE'
 But Poppinga said Vale was sticking to its goal of reaching
full capacity in 2013 and that the export of semi-finished
product -- about 40 percent nickel -- was just a short-term
step.
 Vale produced its first metal from Goro in August, but the
shipments of semi-finished metal to Australia's QNI refinery in
north Australia would be its first exports.
 ""We don't see any reason to change our ramp-up time because
of this,"" Poppinga said, outlining plans to add another 15,000
tonnes of annual production by shipping in some unused parts
from a failed Brazilian nickel mining project to Goro.
 The Goro project's cost was initially put at $3.2 billion
but it later ballooned, partly to meet environmental concerns.
 Goro was originally set to start up in late 2008.
 QNI, owned by Australian financier Clive Palmer, can
produce up to 70,000 tonnes of nickel but operates at around
only 40,000 tonnes due to limited supply of feed material,
Poppinga said.
 Nickel futures prices have surged 22 percent this year on
the London Metal Exchange to about $22,680 a tonne, though it
is well off its year high of $27,095.
 World consumption of primary nickel is forecast to rise to
1.53 million tonnes next year from 1.43 million tonnes in 2010,
according to the International Nickel Study Group.

Foreign Exchange, said China risked becoming a prime target for
speculators as developed countries pump cash into the global
economy, according to China Forex Magazine.
 ""If we do not control the property bubble, let a stock bubble
inflate and allow the yuan to rise freely, China will face the
risk of large-scale cross-boarder capital flows,"" he said.
 The yuan's gradual ascent picked up steam last week even as
Beijing stepped up monetary tightening and announced new measures
to fight capital inflows.
 On Monday, however, the People's Bank of China fixed the
yuan's daily mid-point  versus the dollar at 6.6303,
slightly weaker than Friday's 6.6239.
 With the United States launching a new round of quantitative
easing, many Chinese officials have expressed concern that much
of the money will end up streaming into emerging markets, putting
pressure on them to fend off unwanted capital flows.
 Deng said the U.S. easing could trigger competitive currency
depreciation and undermine global economic growth.
 ""The quantitative easing policy and a 'currency war' would
throw the world economy into a raging storm,"" he added.
 Deng said an upsurge in global liquidity would push commodity
prices higher, foisting imported inflation on emerging economies.

 * But gains fragile and other EZ peripherals also watched
 * China rates, slowdown worries underlying
 By Charlotte Cooper and Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The euro edged higher on Monday,
with some hoping for a rescue package for Ireland, but sentiment
was fragile with the market watching other euro zone economies
and nervous about a prospective tightening in China.
 The yen was in retreat as buying in euros for yen pushed it
down against the dollar as well and as firmer U.S. yields lent
the dollar support. But Japanese exporters were expected to sell
into the gains, meaning moves higher were likely to be limited.
 One Japanese bank trader said macro hedge funds were buying
back the euro against the greenback on hopes of a rescue package
for Ireland, after the euro fell 2.3 percent last week.
 But with the market watching for signs of whether other euro
zone economies might also eventually need help, the euro's gains
were likely to be limited, and some traders did not rule out a
spate of consolidation before the euro probed lower again.
 ""Sentiment remains fragile as European bond concerns taken
together with worries about monetary tightening in China have
resulted in risk appetite declining,"" wrote Mitul Kotecha, global
head of FX strategy at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.
 ""If Ireland does not accept EU funding this week the euro
could see itself quickly in trouble again and the currency is
likely to be sold on rallies up to $1.3826 in the short term.""
 The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.3720, edging up early on bids
from a U.S. bank. It fell to a six-week low of $1.3573 on Friday
before talk of an EU aid package for Ireland lifted it.
 Ireland did not rule out the possibility that it may have to
turn to Europe for help in dealing with its debt crisis but said
that no application had been made for assistance yet. Euro zone
finance ministers meet in Brussels on Tuesday.
 On the charts, the euro had major resistance at $1.3825/35,
intraday highs in the middle of last week, and one dealer said if
it could push above $1.38 then there might be scope for a rise
back to $1.40, but it was likely to be capped there.
 On the downside, it has support at its 55-day moving average
at $1.3552 and needs a weekly close above its 100-week moving
average, now at $1.3640, not to send a bearish signal.
 It gained 0.3 percent on the low-yielding yen to 113.36 yen.
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 82.63 yen, keeping well out of
reach of its 15-year low of 80.21 yen set at the start of the
month. The dealer said stop-loss buy orders were expected at 83
yen and 83.20.
 The dollar has benefited from a sharp rise in Treasury yields
as a run of better economic data led investors to toy with the
idea of a sustainable recovery. The U.S. two-year swap rate
jumped almost 18 basis points last week to 0.70 percent, the
highest in two months.
 ""The dollar's relatively impressive performance comes
before the Fed has even put one dollar's worth of QE2 to
practical work, so some caution regarding the sustainability of
this dollar rebound remains warranted,"" wrote analysts at TD
Securities in a note to clients.
 ""But we wonder whether the past week's price action
indicated that dollar sentiment was on the cusp of a significant
trend change from a technical perspective,"" they added.
 Investor appetite for risk took a hit on Friday on speculation
China would have to tighten policy further to curb inflation.
If so, that could ultimately cool the economy and China's
demand for commodities.
 However, the fact that no hike had materialised over the
weekend gave a little support to risk.
 Analysts noted the same fears abounded earlier in the year
only for the Chinese economy to surprise with its resilience,
but the latest bout of worries served as an excuse to take
profits on leveraged positions in commodities.
 The CRB index shed a steep 3.6 percent on Friday, while
gold and oil both dropped, and commodity-sensitive currencies
like the Australian dollar fell steeply.
 On Monday, gold had pulled up a little from the lows and the
Aussie was up 0.4 percent at $0.9883, but still well off its
recent 28-year peak around $1.0182.
 The New Zealand dollar, which also took a spill on Friday,
was soft at $0.7734 on Monday although upbeat retail sales data
helped it pare some losses.

 By Pedro Nicolaci da Costa
 RICHMOND, Va., Nov 14 (Reuters) - Richmond Federal Reserve
President Jeffrey Lacker indicated on Sunday he opposed the
central bank's new round of monetary easing, saying he believed
the policy was potentially dangerous and likely ineffective.
 The Fed announced earlier this month it was pumping an
additional $600 billion into the economy via purchases of
long-term government bonds.
 ""The decision has been made. I was one who thought the
risks exceeded the benefits,"" Lacker told reporters after a
speech at the regional central bank's headquarters.
 Lacker, a vocal inflation hawk, said in a speech to
economics teachers at the regional central bank's headquarters
that monetary policy can lower joblessness only temporarily.
 ""Trying to keep unemployment permanently lower than it
otherwise would be is a recipe for continually accelerated
inflation,"" he said, pointing to the inflation experience of
the 1960s and 1970s as a cautionary tale.
 With the jobless rate currently stuck at 9.6 percent and
inflation running below the Fed's implicit target of 2 percent
or a bit below, the Fed felt compelled to act, delivering
another dose of monetary accommodation.
 During the financial crisis of 2007-2009, the central bank
had already lowered interest rates to effectively zero and
bought some $1.7 trillion in government and mortgage-related
securities.
 The Fed's latest round of bond-buying is an attempt to
lower borrowing costs even further and spur ending, which
officials hope will also boost hiring.
 NO DOLLAR MANIPULATION
 Lacker said the notion, proclaimed loudly by many economic
leaders overseas since the Fed's early November decision, that
the Fed is easing in order to actively weaken the U.S. dollar
and boost exports is misguided.
 ""To say that this is aimed at reducing the dollar is
unfair,"" he said. ""To call it manipulation is grossly unfair.""
 However Lacker, who is not a voter this year on the Fed's
policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, remained
suspicious of trying to address the economy's current problems
through even lower borrowing costs.
 ""At some point in the not-too-distant future, we are likely
to face an economy growing in a self-sustaining way while the
unemployment rate is still relatively high by historical
standards,"" Lacker said. ""The decisions we make at that time
will be the true test of whether we've learned our lessons.""
 The Fed's bloated balance sheet, a direct product of its
policy of asset purchases, has raised concerns about the Fed's
ability to orchestrate a smooth exit.
 Lacker added that the Fed has the tools it needs to
withdraw monetary stimulus when the time is right.
 ""The tricky part is figuring out when and how fast,"" he
said.

 By Ian Chua
 SYDNEY, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Stocks in Asia and Europe fell
on Monday on fears that Ireland may be forced to seek a
financial rescue package, while a jump in U.S. Treasury yields
helped drive the dollar higher.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares shed
0.6 percent in early trade, following most Asian equity markets
lower, as worries about eurozone debt problems intensifed.
 Irish officials have not ruled out the possibility it may
have to turn to Europe for help in dealing with its debt
crisis, but said no application had been made for assistance
yet.
 The Irish Independent reported on Monday that Ireland was
considering asking for money for its banks from the European
Union's emergency fund in a bid to fend off the threat of a
bailout for the state.
 Investors also dumped U.S. Treasuries on renewed criticism
of the Federal Reserve's latest stimulus programme, sending the
five-year Treasury note yield up about 10 basis points to
two-month highs at 1.48 percent.
 Richmond Federal Reserve President Jeffrey Lacker indicated
he opposed the central bank's new round of monetary easing,
saying he believed the policy was potentially dangerous and
likely ineffective.
 ""That looks to be the initial catalyst that sparked the
selloff (in Treasuries), and then it ran into quite a few stops
and became momentum and flow driven,"" said Sue Trinh, currency
strategist at RBC in Hong Kong.
 Persistent concerns that Bejing will raise interest rates
further also spurred selling of riskier assets as traders
worried policy tightening will curb China's robust demand for
commodities and other imports.
 Reversing earlier gains, the MSCI index of Asia Pacific
stocks outside Japan fell 0.7 percent to lows not seen since
Nov. 1. On Friday, the index slid 1.9 percent to post its
biggest one-day percentage fall since late June on worries that
China may have to hike rates more aggressively to contain a
jump in inflation.
 Markets drew no comfort from the G20 and APEC meetings,
which left leaders of the world's most powerful economies
little closer to agreeing on how to prevent fresh crises.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index slipped 0.1 percent, Hong Kong's
Hang Seng index shed 0.8 percent while a volatile Shanghai
Composite Index rose 1 percent, after last Friday's 5.2 percent
slide.
 Japan's Nikkei average bucked the downdraft, however,
ending 1.1 percent higher as exporters such as Canon Inc
benefited from a weaker yen and as data showing Japan's
economic growth accelerated in the third quarter spurred
investors to buy on dips.
 U.S. YIELDS CLIMB
 The dollar reversed losses against a basket of major
currencies as U.S. Treasury yields rose across the curve.
 RBC's Trinh said the rise in yields prompted dollar short
covering, helping the dollar rise 0.3 percent against a basket
of currencies.
 This saw the dollar climb to five-week highs against the
Japanese currency near 83 yen and the euro slip back below
$1.3700. Commodity currencies such as the Australian dollar
erased earlier gains.
 ""There's speculation that the Fed may have to scale back
its asset purchase,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 Further hurt by renewed pressure on commodity prices, the
Aussie dollar retreated to $0.9833 from a session high around
$0.9900. It has fallen some 3.5 percent from a 28-year high
around $1.0182 set last week.
 On the London Metal Exchange (LME), benchmark copper lost 1
percent to $8,530 a tonne, extending Friday's 3 percent slide.
Gold was little changed at $1,366 an ounce, but off a one-week
low of $1,359.70 seen on Friday.
 U.S. crude oil was flat at $85 a barrel, down about 4
percent from a 25-month high of $88.63 hit last Thursday.

 By Ian Chua
 SYDNEY, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Asian stocks fell to two-week
lows on Monday while the dollar rose as worries that China will
tighten monetary policy and persistent concerns about the euro
zone debt crisis kept investors cautious.
 European shares are expected to open lower, extending
losses for the fourth session, hurt by concerns over Ireland's
debt woes and a sell-off in metal prices.
 Bargain hunting in early Asian trade quickly gave way to
more selling as Chinese stocks struggled following a 5.2
percent slide on Friday, when fears China will lift rates
gripped markets.
 Analysts expect more market volatility towards the year-end
as Chinese authorities are seen taking further steps to keep in
check liquidity in the financial system.
 ""An imminent interest rate rise after recent bank reserve
increase is still very likely,"" said a trader at a Shanghai
securities house.
 Reversing earlier gains, the MSCI index of Asia Pacific
stocks outside Japan fell 0.7 percent to reach lows not seen

 Markets drew no comfort from the G20 and APEC meetings,
which left leaders of the world's most powerful economies
little closer to agreeing on how to prevent fresh crises.
 Many analysts said markets had been due for a pullback
regardless, as profit taking set in after a two-month-long
rally and traders prepared to close their books heading into
the year-end.
 Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index slipped 0.1 percent, Hong
Kong's Hang Seng index shed 0.2 percent while the Shanghai
Composite Index was up 0.2 percent, having drifted in and out
of negative territory.
 Japan's Nikkei average, however, climbed 1.1 percent as
exporters such as Canon Inc benefited from a weaker yen and
data showing Japan's economic growth accelerated in the third
quarter spurred investors to buy on dips.
 BHP Billiton fell 0.4 percent as investors took profits on
earlier gains after the top global miner scrapped its $39
billion bid for Potash Corp and said it would return $4.2
billion to investors through a share buy-back.
 Some investors also described the buy-back as modest.
 U.S. YIELDS CLIMB
 The dollar reversed losses against a basket of major
currencies, climbing 0.2 percent after the 10-year Treasury
note yield rose to a two-month high at 2.823 percent.
 ""Comments from Richmond Fed President Lacker that he
opposed the Fed's new round of QE and the policy was more
dangerous than it is worth sparked the initial move, leading to

 But net external demand made no contribution to overall
economic growth, boding ill for the export-reliant economy.

 * Germany says it not pressing Ireland to take financial aid

(Adds comments from Finance Dept spokesman)
 By Carmel Crimmins and Annika Breidthardt
 DUBLIN/BERLIN, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Ireland did not rule out
the possibility that it may have to turn to Europe for help in
dealing with its debt crisis on Sunday but said that no
application had been made for assistance yet.
 ""Things are happening day by day,"" Justice Minister Dermot
Ahern told national broadcaster RTE's ""The Week in Politics""
when asked if he would put his reputation on the line and say
that Dublin would not apply for aid.
 In an emailed statement, a spokesman for the Department of
Finance said there were ongoing contacts with international
colleagues ""in light of current market conditions"" but repeated
that no application had been made for assistance.
 EU sources over the past two days have said that talks on a
possible bailout were under way and that Ireland, with borrowing
costs rocketing, was unlikely to hold out without assistance.
 The European Union is keen for Ireland to accept aid,
sources have said, to avert a Greek-style scenario where budget
problems in one country plunge the entire euro zone into crisis.
 Ahern said reports Ireland was in aid talks were ""fiction"".
 ""There are no negotiations going on. If there were, the
government would be aware of it, and we are not aware of it,"" he
said in a script released by RTE, adding that he had spoken to
Prime Minister Brian Cowen on Sunday and to Finance Minister
Brian Lenihan.
 Ireland would become the second euro zone country after
Greece to obtain an international rescue but, earlier, another
cabinet colleague said Ireland was not like Greece in that it
was funded until mid-2011 and therefore did not need assistance.
 ""We have every confidence that we will be able to manage
this economy,"" the minister of enterprise, trade and innovation
Batt O'Keeffe said. ""It's been a very hard-won sovereignty for
this country and this government is not going to give over that
sovereignty to anyone.""
 He added that the International Monetary Fund had stated it
believed Ireland could manage on its own.
 Germany, the EU's chief paymaster, said it was not exerting
pressure on Ireland to accept aid.
 EU sources said the range of aid under discussion was 45
billion-90 billion euros ($63 billion-$123 billion), depending
on whether Ireland needed support for its banks, driven into
debt by the financial crisis and a property market crash.
 Such aid, if it were needed, could come from an initial EU
bailout mechanism or from the 440 billion euro European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) set up after Greece was
forced to seek help in May.
 
 PORTUGAL STILL UNDER SCRUTINY
 One of the sources said Dublin was not keen on applying for
emergency funding, but that it may not have a choice if it came
under renewed attack in financial markets.
 Ireland has blamed Germany for aggravating its woes by
pushing the idea of asset value reductions or ""haircuts"" for
private bondholders in a euro zone rescue mechanism from 2013, a
move which sent spreads wider on bonds of euro zone peripheral
nations.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel was quoted as saying at last
week's G20 meeting that markets must understand that politicians
cannot keep asking taxpayers to pay for losses incurred by
investors when markets turn against them.
 Ireland's borrowing costs shot to record highs in the past
week on concerns about a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross
domestic product this year and worries private bondholders could
be forced to take such ""haircuts"" on their holdings.
 The focus on Ireland has not helped ease pressure elsewhere
in the euro zone periphery.
 The foreign minister of Portugal, seen by many investors as
the next country that could need aid, said on Saturday that
failure to adopt a broad coalition government to deal with the
crisis may force the country out of the euro.
 Greece's prime minister said in an interview on Saturday
that the possibility of extending repayment of its
110-billion-euro EU/IMF loan was up for discussion.
 On Sunday, Greece was holding local elections that could
complicate its deficit-cutting efforts.
 Erik Nielsen, chief European economist at Goldman Sachs,
wrote in a note on Sunday that the European Commission may be
discussing a possible aid deal this weekend with Portugal, which
has a smaller deficit but more acute funding needs than Ireland.
 ""In spite of their differences, if (when) Ireland or
Portugal officially seeks help, it can only be in everyone's
interest to start the process for the other country at the same
time,"" he said in the note.

 * To announce tenders for oil export pipelines soon
 
 By Rania El Gamal and Ahmed Rasheed
 BAGHDAD, Nov 14 (Reuters) - British oil najor BP and
partners were expected to meet an initial target of a 10 percent
rise in output from the Rumaila oilfield, the backbone of Iraq's
crude production, by end-November, an Iraqi oil official said.
 Deputy oil minister Abdul Kareem Luaibi said on Sunday the
ministry was also examining how a consortium led by Italian gorp
ENI managed to boost output from the Zubair oilfield by more
than 10 percent.
 ""Yes, we expect to achieve the 10 percent increase by the
end of this month,"" he told Reuters when asked if BP and its
partners will reach their initial production target in November.
 ""For Zubair, there is an increase but it is under study ...
The increase was more than 10 percent from Zubair,"" he said,
adding the ministry would announce the rise officially after it
had been studied and tested.
 Supergiant Rumaila, with 17 billion barrels in estimated
crude reserves, is the workhorse of Iraq's oil industry,
producing almost half its total output of 2.5 million barrels
per day (bpd).
 BP and Chinese partner CNPC signed a 20-year development
contract for Rumaila and expect to increase output to 2.85
million bpd in six years. The group agreed on a baseline
production level of 1.066 million bpd, according to Iraqi
officials.
 ENI, along with U.S.-based Occidental Petroleum Corp and
KOGAS, sealed a 20-year contract with Iraq to develop the Zubair
oilfield. They set an output target of 1.2 million bpd and
agreed on a baseline production level of 183,000 bpd.
 The deals were part of a series of contracts Iraq signed
with oil companies to develop its vast oil reserves. If all the
projects turn out as planned, Iraq could boost its capacity to
Saudi levels of 12 million bpd.
 Iraq will start paying development costs next year to oil
companies that won contracts to develop the reserves after they
reach initial output targets, Luaibi said. ""For the 2011 budget,
we have allocated a certain amount of money to pay costs to the
companies who deserve payment.""
 To meet the anticipated rise in oil production, Iraq plans
to overhaul its crumbling infrastructure and export pipelines as
it aims to become one of the world's top oil powers.
 The oil ministry has asked international firms that won
contracts to develop oilfields whether they were interested in
financing the country's crude export infrastructure projects.
 BP, CNPC, U.S. company ExxonMobil and Russia group Lukoil
were among companies interested in funding part of the export
projects, Luaibi said.
 ""We are in the stage of preparing the tender documents and
we are about to sign with a consultancy to verify these
documents for us and we will announce it soon,"" he said.
 The ministry is exploring all options to finance its costly
plans, including asking oil companies to either contribute
funding or offering the projects under build, operate and
transfer (BOT) contracts.

 KIEV, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Ukraine and the European Union have
yet to agree on terms of trade in hundreds of mostly
agricultural goods, before a free trade agreement (FTA) can be
signed, Ukraine's top trade negotiator says.
 Trade turnover between the European bloc and the former
Soviet nation peaked at $40 billion in 2008 before falling to
$22 billion last year due to the global downturn. The EU is a
net exporter to Ukraine.
 The EU remains Ukraine's main trading partner, accounting

The two have been holding regular FTA negotiations since early
2008 but it remains unclear when they could be concluded.

told Reuters in an interview ahead of a EU-Ukraine summit in
Brussels on Nov. 22.
 No breakthroughs could be expected at the summit, he said.
 ""Many issues depend on finding a compromise. We are trying
not to be pupils writing down a dictation from a teacher. We
have not been defined as a 'younger brother' accepted into the
union who needs to be taught by dictation. There must be no
winners and losers.""
 Ukraine's main exports to the EU are agricultural products,
energy, chemicals, iron, and steel. EU exports to Ukraine are
mostly machinery, transport equipment, chemicals, textiles and
clothing, as well as agricultural products.
 
 AGRICULTURE MAJOR ISSUE
 The EU says it offers Ukraine the highest level of trade
liberalisation ever offered to a third partner which will
benefit some of its top exports -- steel, textiles and clothing,
and fertilisers.
 But Pyatnitskiy said Ukraine was keen to carve out a niche
for other sectors as well, first of all agriculture. About 400
agricultural goods are likely to be exempt from free trade under
the deal, he said.
 ""In agriculture there are issues of state aid. Of course,
the two sides' capabilities are very different,"" he said. ""The
EU subsidises exports of some of its agricultural products from
time to time. We cannot afford to do that, this is expensive.""
 ""We are saying: 'If you are exporting to us, please drop the
export subsidies.' Otherwise this becomes unfair competition.""
 The EU, on the other hand, has rules such as minimum ""entry
prices"" that make Ukrainian goods less competitive, Pyatnitskiy
said. It also has relatively high import duties for agricultural
products that Ukraine sells.
 ""We want to either have those duties minimised or to have
significant tariff quotas (under which duties do not apply),"" he
said.
 Intellectual property rights are also a sensitive issue as
EU regulations would require Ukrainian makers of alcoholic
drinks such as cognac and champagne to rebrand their products.
 
 LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES
 Pyatnitskiy said other issues included cars and shipping
services. Ukraine, whose ZAZ car plant produces Daewoo- and
Chevrolet-developed vehicles, wants to keep a 10 percent car
imports duty.
 The EU, on the other hand, does not want to liberalise its
land shipping sector.
 ""This means I can tell our car shipping companies:
'Gentlemen, you are not gaining anything out of this free trade
deal',"" Pyatnitskiy said.
 ""The EU wants us to fully liberalise imports of cars... All
right, I've bought those trucks...that match all the EU
standards but then I have no access to that (shipping) market.""
 He said it was unlikely that any breakthroughs would be
announced or agreed at the forthcoming Brussels summit.
 The EU is not offering Ukraine an accession programme at the
moment and the sides are discussing, apart from the FTA, issues
such as visa-free travel.
 ""We can adopt and implement all the EU laws but if it does
not create new opportunities for our businesses in one sector or
another to access the EU market then you have to ask the
question why,"" Pyatnitskiy said.
 ""If we were talking about accession it would be one thing.
When we are talking about a free trade agreement, even a deep
and comprehensive one, it is still above all an issue of trade
and benefits that businesses may really get.

192,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2010 09:52PM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Trade deals in the Asia-Pacific region," Nov 14 (Reuters) - Asia-Pacific leaders were set on Sunday
to embrace plans for balanced growth and free trade in the
world's fastest growing economic region, but signs of discord
resurfaced over how best to ensure global recovery.
 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) consists of 21
economies accounting for more than half of world economic output
and the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) would, if
realised, be the world's largest.
 But frictions over currencies and geopolitical rivalries
complicate the task of economic integration in a group that
include poor countries such as Papua New Guinea, fast growing
emerging markets such as Indonesia and Mexico, and the three
biggest economies, the United States, China and Japan.
 Here's a sampling of trade deals in the region:
 ASEAN
 Seven of the 10-member Association of South East Asian
nations are also members of APEC -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The non-APEC
members are Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.
 The ASEAN grouping, which includes 590 million people,
already has free trade deals with China, India, Japan, South
Korea, and Australia and New Zealand.
 UNITED STATES
 Washington has free trade pacts with six countries in the
APEC region, including Canada and Mexico as part of the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The others are with
Australia, Singapore, Peru and Chile.
 It signed a free trade agreement with South Korea in 2007 but
the deal has languished in the face of opposition in the U.S.
Congress. The two sides failed to revive the stalled deal last
week when President Barack Obama and President Lee Myung-bak met
on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Seoul.
 Obama's administration sees the proposed Trans-Pacific
Partnership (TPP) as a key element of its plan to double U.S.
exports over the next five years. Eight Asia-Pacific nations
launched formal negotiatIons on the plan this year.
 Australia, Brunei, Chile, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and
Vietnam are the other members of the TPP, and the United States
has said it planned to begin talks with Malaysia as a part of the
broad initiative. CHINA
 China, edging past Japan to become the world's second-biggest
economy, has free trade pacts with ASEAN, Chile, Hong Kong,
Macao, New Zealand, Pakistan, Peru and Singapore.
 It has concluded deals with Costa Rica and Taiwan, and is
negotiating with Australia, the Gulf Cooperation Council,
Iceland, Norway and the Southern African Customs Union.
 China has been studying the possibility of a pact with South
Korea, India and Switzerland. Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul are also
jointly studying a trilateral pact.
 JAPAN
 Japan already has free trade pacts with ASEAN, Brunei, Chile,
India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Singapore,
Switzerland, Thailand and Vietnam. It has been negotiating with
Australia and the Gulf Cooperation Council. Talks with South
Korea had been suspended for six years but trade ministers of the
two countries recently agreed to prepare for resumption of talks.
 Japan said in November that it would start talking with other
countries about the proposed TPP trade pact, but stopped short of
pledging to formally join negotiations, reflecting its worries
over fallout for farmers. It is studying a possible pact with
Mongolia, and is set to hold high-level talks with the European
Union with the aim of launching trade negotiations next year.
 SOUTH KOREA
 Seoul has free trade deals with ASEAN, Chile, Singapore and
Peru as well as trying to concluding the deal with the United
States. It is negotiating with Australia, Canada, Mexico and New
Zealand, and studying pacts with other countries, including China
and Russia.
 OTHERS
 Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Singapore have each
stitched together a string of trade pacts in the region and are
actively negotiating more.
 The European Union has also been focusing on bilateral deals
with countries in Asia. Besides having signed a pact with South
Korea, the bloc is currently in talks with India, Singapore and
Malaysia, and less formal discussions with Vietnam and Thailand.

 (Updates and recasts)
 By Linda Sieg and Jonathan Thatcher
 YOKOHAMA, Japan, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Leaders of the world's
most powerful economies went home on Sunday after four days of
summitry that left them little closer to agreeing how best to
rebalance the global economy and stave off fresh crises.
 Two successive summits -- first the Group of 20 meeting of
advanced and emerging economies in Seoul, followed by this
weekend's Asia-Pacific leaders' gathering in Yokohama -- were
marked by splits on economic policy between the United States and
the world's new number two economy, China.
 U.S. President Barack Obama made little headway in his
efforts to persuade counterpart Hu Jintao to do more to change
the structure of the Chinese economy so the United States could
ramp up exports there.
 Beijing is concerned that too radical adjustments will
undermine its economic growth.
 ""Advanced economies have to cope with serious unemployment
problems, while emerging market economies are confronted with
asset price bubbles and inflationary pressure,"" Hu told other
leaders of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
in the Japanese port city.
 The two-day meeting did agree on plans for a free trade area
linking the world's fastest-growing region and to continue an
agreement not to erect new trade barriers.
 They also agreed, as did the G20 summit, to try to breathe
life into the flagging Doha round of global trade talks and to
avoid using competitive devaluations to export their way to
economic recovery.
 But Hu sounded a sombre note amid the public display of amity
by leaders, saying there had been a notable rise in
protectionism, a threat to the lifeblood of a region that depends
so heavily on trade.
 FREE TRADE AREA
 One of the centrepieces of the APEC meeting was to take real
steps towards a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP)
linking the world's three biggest economies -- the United States,
China and Japan -- with some of the fastest-growing emerging
economies in other parts of Asia and Latin America.
 The gathering followed hot on the heels of the G20 summit,
where a vague agreement showed scant unity on how to deal with
current account imbalances, in particular the one between China
and the United States, which risk destabilising the global
economy.
 The risk posed by economic fragility, and the price that
financial markets will extract if it is not addressed, was
underscored at the end of last week as it emerged that deeply
indebted Ireland was in talks about a funding rescue.
 The goal of balanced growth is proving elusive, given deep
divides among indebted advanced and export-driven emerging
economies that were papered over at a G20 summit in Seoul.
 For U.S. President Barack Obama, who may have started his
10-day tour of Asia hoping to put his party's mid-term election
defeats behind him, there were disappointments on the economic
issues that were the primary focus of the trip.
 Washington argues that the global economy can only recover if
its own economy is on the mend, which requires a surge in
exports. It has singled out China and its strong yuan as being a
major barrier to that goal.
 While Washington contends that China's currency is
undervalued, so giving it an export advantage, Beijing argues the
U.S. Federal Reserve's easy-money policy is weakening the dollar
to boost exports and could destabilise other economies.
 Hu said Beijing was committed to exchange rate reform and to
boosting domestic demand but that it would be gradual.

 * Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in focus as APEC meets
 * Sees need to manage capital inflows
 By Yoko Nishikawa
 YOKOHAMA, Japan, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Indonesia's priority is
to wrap up the long-running Doha round of global trade talks
rather than joining a U.S.-led Asia-Pacific free trade
initiative, the country's trade minister said on Saturday.
 Mari Pangestu also said in an interview that differing speeds
of currency appreciation in emerging Asian economies was a source
of anxiety for Indonesia and raised questions over how to manage
large capital inflows into Southeast Asia's biggest economy.
 ""For Indonesia, we think the best thing to do is to conclude
the Doha round,"" she said, when asked if Indonesia would consider
joining the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which would
in principle eliminate all tariffs within the zone it covers.
 World Trade Organisation (WTO) members are trying to reach a
deal to open up global commerce, but the current Doha round of
talks have been stalled since July 2008.
 Pangestu was attending the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum meeting in Yokohama, south of Tokyo,
where leaders are trying to accelerate trade integration in the
region.
 APEC leaders are expected to pledge to take steps to create a
vast Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) in the region,
home to 44 percent of the world's trade and 53 percent of global
economic output.
 One of the ""building blocks"" for the FTAAP is the TPP that
would link nine nations.
 ""At the moment, the deadlock or problems that we face in
negotiating the WTO is the same as what you are going to face in
FTAAP negotiations or TPP negotiations, and maybe even more
because TPP is what's called a very comprehensive or
high-standard trade agreement,"" Pangestu said.
 ""So if you cannot solve it in the WTO, it will be difficult
to solve it in FTAAP or TPP. So for a smallish country like
Indonesia with limited resources for negotiations, let's
prioritise the multilateral negotiations first.""
 Pangestu also said she was worried about differing rates of
currency appreciation in Asia's emerging markets and volatility
of capital inflows into Indonesia.
 Capital inflows into emerging market funds hit a massive
$46.4 billion in the year to the fourth week of October compared
with $9.4 billion for all of 2009, according to Global fund
tracker EPFR.
 ""It is definitely causing a lot of anxiety and raising issues
of how we manage capital inflows, what is the appropriate
exchange rate for countries like Indonesia or any of other
countries,"" she said, adding that she would like to see more
long-term flows come in.
 ""Having gone through the Asian crisis in 1997-1998,
Indonesia, Korea and Thailand are sensitive to these issues. We
have to manage it because it has side effects on our exporters
and our competitiveness.""

 * Range of aid discussed is between 45-90 bln euros-source
 * EU's Rehn says reviewing situation with Irish authorities
 * Eurogroup to discuss Ireland on Tuesday

(Adds euro zone sources)
 By Jan Strupczewski and Carmel Crimmins
 BRUSSELS/DUBLIN, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Ireland can manage on
its own, the head of the International Monetary Fund said on
Saturday, a day after euro zone sources told Reuters the former
""Celtic Tiger"" was in talks about a possible EU rescue.
 IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn told reporters
on the sidelines of an Asia=Pacific conference in Yokohama,
Japan, that Ireland had not asked the Fund for aid.
 ""So far I have not had a request, and I think Ireland can
manage well,"" he said.
 Euro zone sources told Reuters on Friday that talks on
possible aid were under way, and one official said it was ""very
likely"" Ireland would get help from the European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF), set up after Greece was forced to
seek help in May.
 ""We do not really see how Ireland is going to be able to
'hold on' without EFSF help,"" one euro zone source with
knowledge of the talks said. 
 ""Obviously since this implies a pretty tough programme for
the government and to some extent a loss of sovereignty, they
want to think twice..."" the source said.
 Euro zone sources said the range of aid under discussion was
45 billion to 90 billion euros, depending on whether Ireland
would need support for its banking sector.
 The German Sunday newspaper Welt am Sonntag cited EU
diplomatic sources as saying Ireland may have to call on up to
70 billion euros, according to a prepublication text sent to
Reuters.
 A second euro zone source said the EU was pressing Ireland
to accept emergency funding and added that Dublin was not keen
to apply for it but might not have a choice, depending on the
behaviour of markets.
 
 BANKING SECTOR
 The first source said that while the Irish government was
fully funded until mid-2011, much depended on the state of the
Irish banking sector, which has suffered huge losses in the wake
of the financial and economic crisis.
 It was not certain that Ireland would apply for EU help in
the end, but if Irish banks needed any additional support, this
could force Dublin to seek EU assistance.
 ""I don't think there will be a run on banks, but it depends
on how they shape up next week,"" the first source said.
 Dublin has repeatedly denied that it plans to tap EU funds.
 European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli
Rehn told Finnish broadcaster YLE: ""We are ready and reviewing
the situation in close cooperation with Ireland's authorities.""
 He said a meeting of euro zone finance ministers, the
Eurogroup, would discuss Ireland on Tuesday.
Strauss-Kahn said he was unaware of talks about an EU
bailout of Ireland. He said Ireland's difficulties had been
caused mainly by one big bank and were very different from those
of Greece, whose economy faces deep-seated competitiveness
problems.
 Ireland's borrowing costs shot to record highs this week on
concerns about its deficit and worries private bondholders could
be forced to take ""haircuts"" on their holdings.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet declined
on Saturday to comment on the situation in Ireland, but said
governments needed to step up budget tightening.
 Going to the EU for aid would be a humiliating setback for a
country that posted the highest average growth rate in the
16-nation euro zone in the bloc's first decade of existence.
 The financial crisis, weak banking regulation and a property
bubble fuelled by rock-bottom interest rates have combined to
inflate its budget deficit to a projected 32 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP) this year, by far the highest in Europe.
 Ireland has accused Germany of aggravating its woes by
pushing the idea of asset value reductions or ""haircuts"" for
private bondholders in a future rescue mechanism from 2013.
Sources told Reuters on Friday that the German government
had largely agreed on a plan that would include liability for
private investors. It may discuss them with euro zone partners
in Brussels on Tuesday.
 In Dublin, politicians and newspapers fretted over the loss
of economic sovereignty an EU bailout could bring.
 Eamon Gilmore, leader of the centre-left opposition Labour
party, said Ireland needed to redouble efforts to solve its
crisis and avoid being ""pushed around"".
 In an editorial entitled ""In the last chance saloon"", the
Irish Times said all paths were painful, but the only real
option was to fight on to avoid losing sovereignty.
 The Irish Daily Mail criticised assurances from Prime
Minister Brian Cowen that Ireland was fully funded until
mid-2011 and so did not need a bailout.
 ""There is an extremely large elephant in the room -- and
that is the question: how are things going to be different by
next July?"" it asked.

 * China rare earth restrictions a ""wake-up call""
 * Japan faces tough political decisions on TPP trade deal
 By Linda Sieg
(Adds quotes, background)
 YOKOHAMA, Japan, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Reaching a U.S.-South
Korea trade deal that boosts American exports and creates jobs is
more important than rushing to clinch an agreement, U.S. Trade
Representative Ron Kirk said on Saturday.
 Kirk, in an interview with Reuters, also said that China's
recent limits on exports of rare earth minerals vital to
high-tech products, were a ""wake up call"" about the risk of
relying on one country for supplies, but gave no indication that
Washington would complain to the World Trade Organisation (WTO)
 The United States and South Korea failed to reach agreement
on the trade deal in talks in Seoul on Thursday, jeopardising the
pact signed three years ago and embarrassing both.
 ""I think it's much more critical that we get it right than we
rush to just take an agreement for the sake of saying we've got
an agreement,"" Kirk told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines
of an Asia-Pacific summit in Yokohama, south of Tokyo.
 Analysts have said a final agreement could languish for
another year or more.
 The deal, if ratified by the two countries' legislatures,
would be one of the largest free trade pacts ever and the largest
signed by the United States since the North America Free Trade
agreement with Canada and Mexico that took effect in 1994 Studies
say the deal would boost the $66.7 billion in annual two-way
trade by as much as 25 percent.
 ""...The one thing all Americans agree on is that a 9.6
percent unemployment rate in their minds is at least 9 points too
high,"" Kirk said.
 ""We are focused on what we can do in a thoughtful way to help
us in an honest way put jobs on the table and so, from the
president's perspective, we can't get this deal done soon
enough,"" Kirk said, noting that U.S. President Barack Obama had
said the aim was to get an agreement in ""weeks, not months"".
 The two sides were working hard to address U.S. congressional
and industry concerns that the deal, signed in 2007, did not do
enough to open South Korean markets to U.S. cars and beef.
 RARE EARTH RISK
 Kirk also said China's recent restrictions on rare earth
exports underscored the risk of relying on a single source for
the elements needed for a broad range of manufactured goods.
 China, which accounts for 97 percent of global output of the
elements used in high-tech devices, imposed broad shipment
restraints on rare earth exports to Japan after a territorial row
over disputed isles in the East China Sea erupted in September.
 ""I don't know that we are at a point, that frankly we could
make a judgment, whether China's actions with respect to Japan
were WTO compliant,"" Kirk said.
 ""In our administration, we have looked at it more from the
strategic need to make sure that the flow of materials that are
this critical to our manufacturing process is going to be met and
we will look at all of the elements around that.
 Kirk also welcomed Japan's decision to begin talks about the
U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade initiative.
 For a graphic on the Trans Pacific Partnership
http://link.reuters.com/byw84q
 Tokyo has stopped short of seeking to join formal
negotiations on the deal out of ruling party concern about the
damage to politically powerful farmers.
 ""Japan has some very difficult political decisions to take,""
Kirk said, adding that the countries now seeking to wrap up a
deal by the next APEC in Honolulu next year were wary of anything
that would slow down their own progress.
 ""But the one thing we have been absolutely unequivocable
about is that this will not slow down our progress in terms of
what looks like now nine or 10 of us in terms of seeing if we
can't be in a position to complete this first round of agreements
by APEC next year.""

between the United States and South Korea right in terms of
substance is more important than rushing to get an agreement,
U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk told Reuters in an interview
on Saturday.
 The United States and South Korea failed to reach an
agreement on a stalled trade deal on Thursday in talks in Seoul,
jeopardising the pact signed three years ago and dealing an
embarrassing blow to both countries.
 The two sides had been working hard to address U.S.
congressional and industry concerns that the deal, signed in
2007, did not do enough to open South Korean markets to U.S. cars
and beef.

199,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2010 09:48PM ET</span>","UPDATE 1-Obama: ""good progress"" toward export goals for Asia"," (Adds more quotes, background.)
 YOKOHAMA, Japan, Nov 13 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack
Obama said on Saturday he has made ""good progress"" on his Asia
tour of increasing U.S. exports to Asia and renewed his pledge
that world leaders must work toward a balanced economic recovery.
 ""One of the important lessons the economic crisis taught us
is the limits of depending primarily on American consumers and
Asian exports to drive economic growth,"" Obama said in a speech
to a business leaders' meeting being held alongside a meeting of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation grouping in Yokohama.
 ""Going forward, no nation should assume that their path to
prosperity is simply paved with exports to America,"" he said.
 During a 10-day Asia tour that has also taken him to India,
Indonesia and South Korea, he has stressed the need to boost
exports to Asia's rapidly growing markets to create jobs at home,
where unemployment has been around 9.5 percent for the paast
year.
 The anemic U.S. economic recovery and stubborn jobless rate
were major reasons for the drubbing Obama's Democrats took in
this month's midterm election.
 Obama said he remained committed to completing a free trade
agreement with South Korea. Failure to reach agreement in time
for his trip to Seoul earlier in the week was an embarassing
setback for Obama, who had pledged to complete the deal announced
in 2007.
 ""Completion of this deal could lead to billions of dollars in
increased exports and thousands of American jobs for American
workers. So I am committed to seeing this through,"" Obama said.
 Obama said he was also committed to doing what was necessary
to cut the U.S. budget deficit in half by 2013, as he has
promised.
 However, he said he would not cut back on investments he
termed essential to the future -- education, clean energy,
research and infrastructure.
 Yokohama is the last stop on a 10-day trip to Asia in which
Obama has also visited India, Indonesia and South Korea. In Seoul
he attended a G20 leaders' summit and in Yokohama he will attend
the APEC meeting before returning to Washington on Sunday.

 By Kiyoshi Takenaka and Gleb Bryanski
 YOKOHAMA, Japan, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Cracks between advanced
and emerging economies that were papered over by the G20
resurfaced at an Asia-Pacific summit on Saturday, with Washington
and Beijing returning to their positions on trade and currencies.
 U.S. President Barack Obama warned countries such as China
against relying too much on exports for growth, and Chinese
President Hu Jintao reiterated Beijing's commitment to a gradual
reform of its exchange rate regime.
 ""One of the important lessons the economic crisis taught us
is the limits of depending primarily on American consumers and
Asian exports to drive economic growth,"" Obama told a forum of
Asia-Pacific business leaders.
 ""Going forward, no nation should assume that their path to
prosperity is simply paved with exports to America,"" he said on
the final leg of a 10-day tour that has also taken him to India,
Indonesia and South Korea.
 The United States and China blame each other for doing more
damage to international trade. Washington contends the yuan is
undervalued, giving it an export advantage, while Beijing argues
the U.S. Federal Reserve's easy-money policy is aimed at
weakening the dollar to boost exports.
 Hu, taking the podium shortly after Obama, told the business
executives China wanted to expand domestic demand growth, and
remained committed to reforming its exchange rate ""on the basis
of retaining initiative, controllability and gradualness"".
 ""China will continue making encouraging a balanced
international balance of payments an important task in ensuring
macroeconomic stability,"" Hu said.
 Obama's national security adviser, Tom Donilon, later told a
news briefing China needed to show progress on reforming the
exchange rate by the time Hu visits Washington in January.
 ""President Hu Jintao's visit in January would be an important
time to look at exactly what the quantum of progress has been on
this,"" Donilon said.
 ""The United States ... would like to see China proceed apace
on these reforms, because it's important, we think, to China, but
it's important to the world in terms of a stable economic path
forward.""
 Obama and Hu joined other leaders of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) group for a weekend summit that is
focusing on policies to ensure balanced growth and taking
concrete steps toward setting up a vast free-trade area in the
world's fastest-growing economic region.
 They ended their first day with a dinner and cultural kabuki
theatre show but, breaking with the ""funny shirts"" tradition of
APEC summits, this year the leaders wore business suits instead
of the host country's native attire for their ""family photo"".
 SOVEREIGN DEBT RISKS
 The APEC leaders agreed after a first round of talks the
world economy was improving but still fragile, a Japanese
government official said. Sovereign debt problems remain a risk,
while unemployment and the financial sector continue to be of
concern, the official said.
 Ireland was a reminder of those risks and the financial
contagion they potentially pose.
 Irish borrowing costs shot to record highs this week because
of concern about the country's ability to reduce a public debt
burden swollen by bank bailouts, and worries that private bond
holders could be forced to shoulder part of the costs of any
bailout by taking ""haircuts"" on their holdings.
 But International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn
told reporters at the APEC summit that ""Ireland can manage well""
and did not need a bailout at this time.
 The G20 countries are trying to find ways of bringing down
overly large current account surpluses and deficits among major
economies. The group's leaders agreed in Seoul to set ""indicative
guidelines"" for imbalances, but offerred investors little proof
that the world was any safer from economic catastrophes.
 REGIONAL TENSIONS
 The leaders of China and Japan met on the sidelines to cool
bilateral tensions, while Beijing offered Japan reassurances over
its concerns about a drying-up of rare earth exports and a
dispute over gas fields.
 A Japanese government official said the 22-minute meeting
between Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Chinese President Hu Jintao
at an Asia-Pacific summit in the Japanese city of Yokahama was a
big step towards improving ties.
 ""I recognise that ties between Japan and China have taken a
big step towards improvement,"" Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet
Secretary Tetsuro Fukuyama told reporters.
 Hours earlier, thousands of Japanese took to the streets of
Yokahama, a port city near Tokyo known for having Japan's biggest
Chinatown, to protest what they see as an imperialistic China.
 Sino-Japanese ties have chilled since September after Japan
detained a Chinese trawler captain whose boat collided with
Japanese coast guard ships near a chain of islands claimed by
both countries, called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China.
 Japan was also trying to defuse another territorial spat,
this one with Russia over an island claimed by both countries.
 Russian President Dmitry Medvedev urged Japanese Prime
Minister Naoto Kana at a meeting on the APEC sidelines to stop
diplomatic gesturing, after the Russian leader recently visited
islands claimed by Japan, Russia's foreign minister said.
 ""Our president said that it is better to abandon emotional
statements and diplomatic gestures because they do not help, but
he proposed to change the approach and prioritise the economy,""
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters.
 APEC is for the first time championing a collective growth
strategy, emphasising balanced and sustainable growth, an elusive
goal when the global economy is split between cash-rich exporters
and debt-burdened importers.
 The leaders will pledge to take steps to create a vast Free
Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) in the region, home to 40
percent of the world's population and 53 percent of global
economic output, by building on existing pacts.

(Updates prices, adds quotes)
 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The euro edged up on Friday
but still had its worst week against the dollar since August,
and traders said lingering uncertainty about Ireland's public
finances should keep it under pressure next week.
 While the dollar benefited this week from fears that
Ireland may need financial assistance to pay its debts, a
second round of monetary easing in the United States was likely
to limit its gains against the euro in the coming sessions.
 Reuters reported that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to
curtail plans to buy $600 billion in U.S. government debt over
the next eight months.
 That means the euro's struggles may be most pronounced
against commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian and
Canadian dollars and the yen, all of which lagged the U.S.
dollar's gains this week, said BNP Paribas strategist Sebastien
Galy.
 ""Those who want to go short euro should consider doing it
on the crosses,"" he said. ""We particularly like the Canadian
dollar.""
 The euro shed 2.4 percent against the dollar this week, its
biggest slide since mid-August, and fell 1.5 percent against
the Canadian dollar, its biggest weekly decline since
September. It fell 1 percent against the yen since Monday.
 The euro won a brief respite against the U.S. dollar on
Friday, rising 0.3 percent to $1.3694 after European leaders
said Irish creditors would not be forced to write down the
value of their Irish bond holdings in the event of a bailout.
The euro had hit a six-week low below $1.36 overnight.
 Ireland's Finance Ministry said market talk of a bailout
package was untrue, but two-thirds of economists polled by
Reuters said Ireland would likely have to seek international
rescue funds before the end of 2011.
 The euro could potentially test $1.34-$1.35 next week,
strategists said.
 ""All of the factors that weighed on the euro this week
could carry over into next week, with the potential debt
problems in Ireland and direction of equities likely at the
forefront,"" said John Doyle, currency strategist at Tempus
Consulting in Washington.
 Against the yen, the dollar was flat at 82.51 yen on Friday
but was up almost 1.6 percent on the week, its biggest weekly
gain since Japan intervened to weaken the yen in September.
 U.S. DATA, CHINA ON MARKET RADAR
 The dollar's fortunes next week will be heavily influenced
by economic data, including retail sales and inflation.
 Analysts said the reports will be watched more for what
they tell investors about Fed easing than what they indicate
about the outlook for the U.S. economy in the near term, which
is weak.
 The potential for Chinese rate hikes to fight off inflation
will also be on investors' minds. Such speculation knocked
stocks, bonds and commodity prices lower on Friday as investors
booked profits heading into the weekend.
 The Australian dollar, a favorite among investors for its
trade links with China, fell as low as $0.9825, its lowest
since Nov. 1. It was last down 1.3 percent at $0.9802. It hit a
28-year high last week above $1.01.
 Investors will also watch for more capital controls in
emerging markets that have complained that the Fed's monetary
policy is stoking inflation beyond U.S. borders.
 Analysts said a G20 meeting that ended Friday seemed to
give the green light to emerging countries with flexible
currency regimes to impose capital controls.

 By Martin Roberts
 SARRIA, Spain, Nov 12 (Reuters) - A senior European Central
Bank member suggested on Friday the bank had no plans to step up
its purchases of euro zone bonds, saying its debt buying was not
comparable to those of the U.S. and British central banks.
 The ECB has spent a total of 64 billion euros buying bonds
since May, but the pace of purchases has dropped off and the
bank has been reluctant to buy the debt of crisis-hit euro zone
countries like Ireland and Portugal.
 ""This programme is not comparable to American or British
quantitative easing,"" European Central Bank Executive Board
Member Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said when asked why the bank
was not buying more peripheral euro zone debt.
 ""We are in charge of monetary not fiscal policy,"" he told
reproters before giving a speech in northern Spain.
 Last week the U.S. central bank announced a new programme of
quantitative easing, in which it intends to buy $600 billion of
U.S. government securities through the middle of next year in an
effort to bolster the economy.
 Gonzalez-Paramo welcomed a statement from France, Germany,
Italy, Spain and Britain at the G20 summit in Seoul that
confirmed debt holders would not take a hit if the EU proceeded
with plans to introduce a new mechanism allowing crisis-hit
countries to restructure their debt.
 He said it was up to each member of the European Union to
decide whether it needed financial aid from the EU's current aid
facility, declining to comment on whether Ireland was seeking
financial assistance.
 During his speech, Gonzalez-Paramo said the euro currency
zone was not in crisis but lacked a framework for its members to
coordinate fiscal and macroeconomic policies
 He predicted that the gap in economic growth rates between
different countries in the euro zone would close next year.
While Germany's economy is expected to expand by more than 3
percent this year, growth in Spain has stagnated.

 SAO PAULO/MEXICO CITY, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Brazil's currency
sank to its weakest levels since September on Friday and
Mexico's peso dropped to a two-week low on concern over euro
zone debt and speculation that China could hike interest
rates.
 Markets were also hurt by lingering fears about Ireland's
fiscal health despite reassurance on Friday from EU leaders

 Prices of the region's main commodities tumbled as analysts
said higher inflation in China could lead the Asian giant to
tighten monetary policy. This put pressure on Latin America's
currencies. [ID:nSGE6AB09V]
 Furthermore, a meeting in South Korea of leaders from the
Group of 20 rich and emerging nations offered little
reassurance to investors about the worldwide dispute over the
level of some countries' currencies. [ID:nN11196971]
 ""It's a lot of bad news for just one day,"" said Reginaldo
Galhardo, head of currency trading at the Treviso brokerage in
Sao Paulo.
 ""There are doubts about global growth, rumors from China
and Ireland continue to be a concern,"" he said. ""With this
currency war, the market is worried because who knows what will
come of all of this.""
 The Brazilian real closed down 0.29 percent on the local
spot market, bidding 1.722 per dollar, its lowest level since
Sept. 20.
 The Mexican currency  slipped to its weakest level
since Nov. 1, down 0.59 percent at 12.336.

 The Colombian peso  gave up 0.78 percent to 1,868.5

 Like many of the region's currencies, the Colombian peso
has rallied over recent months. The government has purchased

 NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The euro pared gains against
the dollar on Friday, remaining near a six-week low, as
roiling financial markets outweighed a move by European
leaders to reassure nervous bondholders about the value of
their holdings.
 While the dollar benefited from the market turmoil, the
Federal Reserve's quantitative easing will likely keep
pressure on the greenback. Reuters reported that the Fed is
unlikely to stop short of the full $600 billion bond-buying
amount. [ID:nN12286341]
 The euro was given an early reprieve as European leaders
reiterated to bondholders they would not be forced to take
losses in the event of a new euro-zone bailout, but a deluge
of separate factors curtailed its upward momentum.

 ""All of these joined forces to take the wind out of the
euro's sails,"" said John Doyle, foreign exchange strategist at
Tempus Consulting in Washington D.C.
 ""What we have overall is general risk aversion and the
dollar has gained on the tail of that,"" he said.
 The euro responded to steady buying by macro funds as the
cost of insuring Irish, Spanish and Portuguese debt against
default fell.
 ""All of the factors that weighed on the euro this week
could carry over into next week, with the potential debt
problems in Ireland and direction of equities likely at the
forefront,"" Doyle said. ""We could very well see a $1.35 by the
end of the month.""
 The euro  rose to a session high of $1.3777, well
off the session low of $1.3573 on EBS. It last traded at
$1.3693, up 0.3 percent .
 At the session low, the euro/dollar broke through the 38.2
percent Fibonacci retracement level, at 1.3631, of the move
from the August low to the November peak. The 50 percent
retracement comes at 1.3431, with the 61.8 percent at 1.3232.
 Speculation of a rescue package for Ireland added to the
euro's allure earlier in the global session though the Irish
Finance Ministry said market talk of a bailout package with
the EU was untrue.
 Two-thirds of economists and bond strategists polled by
Reuters on Thursday said Ireland would seek international
rescue funds before the end of next year. [ID:nLDE6AA0UH]
 The euro has shed 2.5 percent this week, the biggest
weekly loss in three months, as long positions built before
the Fed's bond-buying decision last week have been unwound
heading into the year-end book-closing season.
 G-20 AND CHINA
 Analysts said the communique from Group of 20 leaders
meeting in Seoul was mildly positive as it agreed to tackle
tensions that have threatened ""currency wars"" and trade
protectionism. [ID:nSGE6AB00Y].

$917 million and sold $600 million in October, taking net demand
to $317 million. Earlier this year, monthly average net demand
for dollars and euros stood at around $30-40 million.
 Belarus took markets by surprise in early 2009 when it
devalued its rouble  by 20 percent after the government
said no devaluation was planned. The currency has weakened
around 4 percent since the start of this year.
 One banker, who asked not to be named, said the increased
demand for foreign currencies might be linked to fears the same
could happen again.
 ""The word 'panic' would be to strong but some wariness, some
negative expectations are in place,"" the banker said.
 Belarus' long-serving leader Alexander Lukashenko said on
Friday no devaluation was planned.
 ""This issue was raised by phonies... They just need to stir
people ahead of elections,"" local agencies cited Lukashenko as
saying. ""You can stage the devaluation yourself if you continue
buying foreign currencies.""
 The 55-year-old Lukashenko, who has been in power since
1994, is seeking re-election on December 19 and has pledged to
raise salaries by a third in contravention of a $3.5 billion aid
agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
[ID:nLDE68N1J7]
 The IMF has said such a hike would have no economic
rationale and would double Belarus' 2010 budget deficit.
[ID:nLDE68R0RQ]
 ""When such a rapid increase in salaries is taking place,
people understand that money won't emerge from the air... What
is going on now is just an attempt to protect from
devaluation,"" said Sergei Chaliy, an independent finance
analyst.

 By Emelia Sithole-Matarise
 LONDON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Irish government bond yields fell
on Friday, easing pressure on other peripheral euro zone issuers
on reports Dublin was in talks to get European Union aid and
that there would not be any debt restructuring tied to it.
 The improved tone in the euro zone's weakling sovereign
issuers stemmed the flight to safe-haven German bonds, driving
the Bund future more than one percentage point down on the day
to its lowest in almost two weeks.
 But Irish bonds remained under heavy pressure, with 10-year
yields only back around Wednesday's levels near 8.5 percent as
the European Union and Ireland's finance ministry denied news
reports a bailout was being hammered out.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking at the G20 summit
in Seoul, said the European Union was ready to deal with all
scenarios in the Irish financial crisis and, in an attempt to
reassure investors, leaders said new rules concerning writedowns
would only apply to future bond issues.
""The rumours that the EU may come out with a support package
for Ireland has led to a bout of short covering. Investors are
very short Ireland,"" said Nick Stamenkovic, an interest rate
strategist at RIA Capital Markets.
 ""Most of the long-term players will just be sitting on the
sidelines. There's so much volatility in the market they don't
want to get involved until the situation clarifies.""
 Dealers marked Irish bonds higher, narrowing the 10-year
yield spread over Bunds to 594 basis points from Thursday's
record 685 bps, although the market remained illiquid.
 The Portuguese spread was 37 bps tighter at 444 bps.
 Underlining the troubles Ireland's banking sector faces,
Irish banks increased their borrowing at the European Central
Bank by more than 10 billion euros last month.
 ""I don't think Ireland can survive without access to this
fund,"" said Matteo Regesta, a strategist at BNP Paribas.
 ""Psychology is still for the wait and hold, and the
expectation ...that by delivering the budget by the end of the
year the market will endorse the fiscal consolidation and
pressure will gradually fade from Irish debt, something which we
don't see happening.""
 Spain and Italy saw 10-year yield spreads over Bunds hitting
new euro lifetime highs in early trade, before retreating to
stand tighter at 204 bps and 163 bps respectively.
 ""The widening has spilt over significantly into Spain and
Italy in recent days, which will probably worry EU leaders quite
a lot and they seem to be starting to realise the seriousness of
the situation as the European Financial Stability Fund is
designed for smaller countries,"" a trader said.
 Lloyds TSB said Irish 10-year yields price an 80 percent
chance of default, Portuguese around 65 percent and Spain 30
percent.
 ""The discussion of `orderly defaults' opened Pandora's box,""
the bank's strategists said. ""The sharp rise in yields is now
all about expectations of future default -- restructuring -- and
not difficulties in financing.""
 Both the Portuguese and Irish 2/10 yield curves are close to
inversion in absolute terms and in asset swap, a pattern seen
earlier in the year with Greek bonds and a move that typically
reflects default fears.
 December Bund futures settled 77 ticks down at 129.41 with
cash German bond yields rising across the board, notably Schatz
yields which were up 10 bps at 1.03 percent.
 Italy's bond sale went better than expected after its paper
cheapened significantly heading into the sale.
 ""From an amount perspective, Italy weathered the storm
well,"" said Commerzbank strategist David Schnautz.
 ""However, the turmoil obviously left its toll on BTPs in the
run-up to the auction. Looking forward, politics should remain
in the driving seat in the short term regarding the euro zone
peripheral government bonds.""

on current remuneration levels and their salaries should be
capped at that level.

before Nov. 25 by-election, a day after Cowen says he is still
aiming to meet an original deadline of mid-November.

Ireland, says he has not discussed any need for EU bailout,
adding he believes market confidence would be restored once the
country published its four-year plan to cut debt.

 BRUSSELS, Nov 12 (Reuters) - European capitals have approved
interim import duties on Chinese glossy paper, which the EU says
is being dumped on European markets, EU diplomats said on
Friday.
 Plans for antidumping duties of up to 39.1 percent on coated
fine paper were passed by ""a comfortable majority"" during a
meeting this week of EU trade officials and national government
representatives, one diplomat said.
 Indonesian paper giant Asia Pulp and Paper (APP), which
exports paper to Europe from China through two subsidiaries,
will be the only company to be granted a lower rate, of 19.7
percent, diplomats told Reuters.
 The tariffs must be launched by Nov. 17, under EU law.
 But trade officials at the meeting would not be drawn on
whether the European Commission will seek to impose further
duties by mid-January, in a parallel investigation into Chinese
subsidies for the paper industry, diplomats said.
 Those duties must launch in Jan. 2011, under EU law. The
subsidy investigation, with serious political implications, is
Europe's first against China.
 EU trade chief Karel De Gucht said this week that China
subsidises ""nearly everything"" and that the EU will increasingly
target Chinese state assistance, fanning tensions with Beijing.

 Coated fine paper is used mainly for coffee-table books and
glossy brochures.
 Complaints lodged early this year by EU papermakers, led by
the European operations of South Africa's Sappi, prompted the
Commission to start the two investigations.

issued a profit warning for the year ending December on Friday
and attributed it to rising raw material prices and unfavourable

 Sameer said in a statement to the Nairobi Stock Exchange
that the cost of natural rubber, the main component of tyre
manufacturing, had so far risen 40 percent in dollar terms this
year compared with the fourth quarter of 2009.
 ""The expected shortfall in earnings is attributed to the
escalating world prices of raw materials used in manufacturing,

 Sameer posted a pretax profit of 221.46 million shillings

million in 2008. Its pretax profits for the six months to June
stood at 71.9 million shillings from 61.87 million in the same
period a year ago.
 Sameer said that due to difficult and highly competitive
local and regional market conditions, the market was unable to
take a full price adjustment due to the rise in raw material
prices.
 It added that the depreciation of the Ugandan and Tanzanian
shillings against the dollar was also a factor, while the
Japanese yen's appreciation had made their imported tyres more
expensive.
 ""Our projection is the impact of the above factors will
adversely affect our volumes, value and projected profits for
the year ending ... December 2010,"" Sameer said.
 ""While it is projected that the results will be positive,
our earnings are expected to be lower than current market
expectations for the year ending 31 December 2010.""

 RUMOR AND DENIAL
 Ireland's debt problems, much like the rest of peripheral
Europe, are keeping investors on edge despite the denial from
leaders that bondholders were at risk.
 Sources told Reuters on Friday that Ireland is in talks to
tap emergency funds from the European Financial Stability
Facility that would allow investors to avoid taking a loss on
their investments. [ID:nBRU011130]
 The premium demanded to hold Irish 10-year bonds over
German bonds narrowed from record high levels.
 Spreads between 10-year Irish bond yields and German
benchmarks fell nearly 100 basis points, ending a fierce
two-week bout of peripheral debt selling which has raised
concerns about the stability of the currency zone and hammered
the euro. [ID:nLDE6AB0UX]
 But nervousness about Ireland and other troubles in
peripheral euro zone countries kept yield spreads elevated,
with the premium for holding Spanish and Italian over German
bonds rising to euro lifetime highs in early trade.
 ""On the G20 we should get more communication over the
weekend. I don't think we can expect the world will be fixed,
but what we want is a feeling that the worst will be avoided,""
Philip Isherwood, European equities strategist at Evolution
Securities, said.
 In the currency markets, the euro was up 0.43 percent at
$1.3686 against the dollar , having earlier hit a
six-week low of 1.3573 on EBS trading platform.
 The dollar fell 0.25 percent to 82.31 against the yen

 NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The euro rallied on Friday
from a six-week low against the dollar after Europeans leaders
sought to reassure nervous bondholders about the value of their
holdings.
 A statement from France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Britain,
issued at the Group of 20 summit in Seoul, said bondholders
would not be forced to write down the value of their holdings
in the event of a new euro zone bailout. That eased pressure on
Irish debt that has sparked fresh fears of contagion.
 The euro responded to steady buying by macro funds as the
cost of insuring Irish, Spanish and Portuguese debt against
default fell.
 Speculation of a rescue package for Ireland added to the
euro's allure earlier in the global session. This was later
denied and the single currency fell from the session peak.
 ""The fact that euro zone officials said Irish bond holders
don't have to take a haircut on their existing positions is
supportive for the euro,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market
analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange.
 Faith in the value of euro denominated debt bolsters
demand for the euro to buy it or conversely not to sell it and
seek safer havens in non euro denominated debt.
 The euro rose to a session high of $1.3777, well off the
session low of $1.3573 on EBS.
 It last traded at 1.3721 on Reuters data, up 0.5 percent.
 Talk of a rescue package for Ireland as early as next week
was attributed to a U.S. think tank report. But the Irish
Finance ministry said market talk of a bailout package with the
EU was untrue.
 Two-thirds of economists and bond strategists polled by
Reuters on Thursday said Ireland would seek international
rescue funds before the end of next year.
 At the session low, the euro/dollar broke through the 38.2
percent fibonacci retracement level, at 1.3631, of the move
from the August low to the November peak. The 50 percent
retracement comes at 1.3431, with the 61.8 percent at 1.3232.
 The euro has shed over 2 percent this week, the biggest
weekly loss in three month, as long positions built before the
Fed's bond buying decision last week have been unwound heading
into the year-end book-closing season.
 G-20
 Analysts said the communique from Group of 20 leaders
meeting in Seoul was mildly positive as it agreed to tackle
tensions that have threatened ""currency wars"" and trade
protectionism.
 The G-20 seemed to give the green signal to emerging
countries with flexible currency regimes to impose capital
controls.
 ""That seems to have hurt risk appetite a bit and investors
are booking profits in riskier assets,"" said Chris Turner, head
of FX strategy at ING in London.

 ISTANBUL, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The Turkish lira fell on Friday
after the central bank raised the lira reserve requirement and
on Thursday slashed the overnight borrowing rate in a move
apparently aimed at discouraging speculative capital inflows.
 Shares also fell, hit partially by foreign market weakness,
while bond yields were steady after weakening on Thursday due to
European Union debt worries.
 The central bank increased the lira reserve requirement rate
for banks to 6 percent from 5.5 percent on Friday.
 On Thursday evening, it kept its one-week repo policy rate
constant at 7 percent and startled the market by slashing the
overnight borrowing rate to 1.75 percent from 5.75 percent.
[ID:nLDE6AB02F]
 ""The harsh cut in the overnight borrowing rate is a surprise
for the markets. On the other hand, the increased reserve
requirement ratio should further limit the liquidity for banks
hence will have a negative impact on margins,"" said Tera
Research in a note.
 The lira  closed at 1.4280 having weakened to as much
as 1.4415. It closed on Thursday at 1.4230. The benchmark bond
yield <0#TRTSYSUM=IS> was a touch lower at 7.76 percent.
 There was little market reaction to the unemployment rate,
which rose to 11.4 percent in the July-September period from
10.6 percent in the June-August period.
 The National ISE 100 index <.XU100> fell 0.76 percent to
69,042, performing better than the MSCI index of benchmark
emerging stocks <.MSCIEF>, which dipped 1.64 percent.
 The index of banking shares <.XBANK> fared worse than other
stocks, closing down 1.29 percent after the central bank moves.
Banks have complained higher reserve ratios hit their margins,
and they have to increase costs for consumers.
 Turkish Central Bank Governor Durmus Yilmaz said on Friday
after the hike in the reserve requirement that credit expansion
did not currently point to the economy overheating but signalled
more rises could be on the way if loan growth escalates further.
 Amid a swathe of results on Friday Akbank ,
Turkey's second largest lender by market value, posted
unconsolidated net profit down 35 percent to 439 million lira.
Its shares closed down 2.23 percent at 8.78 lira.
 Turkey's largest publishing group Dogan Yayin Holding AS
 posted a third quarter net profit of 16.4 million
lira on Friday, undershooting a Reuters' poll forecast of 59.3
million. Its shares closed up 0.56 percent.
 Isbank  posted third quarter net profit up 33
percent that contrasted with falling profits reported by peers,
as it was helped by favourable valuation methods of
inflation-linked bonds, according to analysts.
 Unconsolidated net profit for the period rose to 577.7
million lira ($404 million), below the average forecast in a
Reuters poll of 594 million lira. Its shares fell 0.93 percent
to 6.4 lira.
 Turkish Airlines  dropped 3 percent after it
posted a 23 million lira net loss in third quarter,
significantly underperforming forecasts.

(Adds quotes, detail, background)
 FRANKFURT, Nov 12 (Reuters) - All major currencies including
the Chinese yuan should eventually have free floating exchange
rates, European Central Bank Governing Council member Erkki
Liikanen said in a television interview.
 ""In the long term it is clear that all major currencies
should move and float freely,"" Liikanen, who also heads the Bank
of Finland, told a Finnish broadcaster in an interview conducted
on Thursday but published on its internet site on Friday.
 ""Then they reflect economic fundamentals and support
economic growth best. This is a major challenge for China.""
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said earlier this month a
steady rise in the yuan would help rebalance the world economy.
[ID:nL5506149]
 Liikanen also told television station MTV3 that excessive
foreign exchange volatility harmed economic growth and financial
stability. ""This is understood by all, and they respect this,
and that is very important.""
 He trusted U.S. policymakers when they said a strong dollar
was in their interests.
 Asked about the Federal Reserve's decision to purchase
government bonds, he said the U.S. central bank had taken into
account the current economic situation.
 The Fed's decision to buy $600 billion of debt has drawn
criticism from many other nations which contend it is generating
global instability by strengthening their currencies against the
dollar, inflating asset bubbles and fuelling inflation in their
economies.
 Liikanen also said all countries understand that
protectionism posed risks to getting the world economy on a
sustainable path.
 ""Free world trade is a central precondition for growth and
well-being,"" he said. ""Everyone understands that taking the
protectionist path would be damaging.""
 He declined to comment on whether Ireland might have to
apply for EU aid, but said that while it was good to have an
organisation such as the European Financial Stability Facility,
in the end all countries should solve their own problems.
 He also joined other ECB policymakers in calling for more
automatic sanctions for EU budget rule-breakers.

 * Bankers say trade finance caught up in new bank rules
 SEOUL, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Leaders of the G20 rich and
emerging economies agreed on Friday to monitor how banking
regulation affects the supply of trade finance, the lifeblood of
global commerce.
 Practitioners of trade finance, which underpins 60-80
percent of the $12-13 trillion in global merchandise trade, say
banking rules designed to forestall a new financial crisis could
make trade finance more expensive or less available.
 Bankers have been calling on the Basel banking regulators to
revise the rules so that trade finance -- which they argue is
much safer than other forms of lending -- is not unfairly
penalised. [ID:nTOE6A907K]
 The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision says it is aware
of the issues, but has not responded to the bankers' calls,
which have been backed up by a database showing that the default
rate on trade finance is only 0.02 percent. [ID:nLDE69D1DU]
 In a statement issued after a two-day summit, the G20
leaders said they would support measures to increase the
availability of trade finance in developing countries,
especially the poorest low-income countries (LICs).
 ""In this respect, we also agree to monitor and assess trade

finance had dried up in the wake of the credit crunch, the G20
put together a $250 billion trade finance package.

227,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2010 10:04AM ET</span>","GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Trimming froth as Ireland, G20 haunt"," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Whether it is just an opportunity
to correct recent market patterns or something more deeply
bearish, investors have decided that a period of avoiding risk
is in order.
 As a result, the combination of the Group of 20 nations
being unable to solve their disagreements over global imbalances
and resurfacing fears about the euro zone periphery's ability to
manage its debt could mean the coming week will be volatile.
 A lot may depend on whether European Union officials do
anything to ease pressure on Ireland's finances. Markets swung
around on Friday on rumours of a bailout, later denied, so the
EU finance ministers meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday should
get even more attention than usual.
 But even beyond that, the risk rally that began in May and
took off in earnest in late August when investors began
preparing for more quantitative easing asset-buying from the
Federal Reserve has come off the boil in recent days.
 The MSCI all-country world stock index has lost a little
more than 2 percent since hitting 26-month highs on Nov. 5,
though it is still 22 percent higher than in May at the height
of the Greek crisis and 16 percent above where it was when more
Fed QE started to be factored in.
 Those kinds of levels are often enough in themselves to
trigger sell-offs, and it is perhaps not surprising that some
tactical re-allocations have taken place.
 At the same time, the dollar has been generally stronger
over the past week or so as risk appetite has eased. ""We have
taken some risk off,"" said John Stopford, head of fixed income
at Investec Asset Management.
 ""We have been quite short dollars and we have bought some
back,"" he said.
 
 BIG AND LITTLE
 The mood has nonetheless been compounded by two factors that
moved into the limelight when the Fed went ahead with its QE,
allowing investors to start focusing on other things.
 First, G20 leaders have spent a lot of time in the past week
reminding investors about the large imbalances in the world
economy, while failing to do much about them.
 They agreed to a watered-down commitment to watch out for
dangerous imbalances, but only after some acrimony.
 As a result, concerns over whether the United States is
deliberately devaluing the dollar to boost its trade and whether
China should let the yuan strengthen remain in place.
 That could prompt emerging market countries to ramp up
capital controls or countries to indulge in protectionist trade
practices, all of which could eventually impact current
investment flows from deficit countries to surplus ones.
 But not immediately, of course.
 Which leads to the second big factor hovering over markets
as the new week starts -- euro zone debt, particularly
Ireland's.
 Irish government bonds have been under intense pressure as
investors have speculated whether the debt-strapped country,
which is fully funded until mid-2011, will have enough money to
keep going and/or pay its obligations.
 Yields fell on Friday after EU leaders reiterated that
holders of outstanding bonds would not be forced to take losses
in any debt restructuring in the bloc. Ireland also insists that
it does not need to apply for EU/International Monetary Fund
assistance.
 But the issue shows no sign of disappearing, and although
contagion has been highly limited so far there are concerns that
jitters will spread to other peripheral EU economies and beyond,
as was the case during the Greek crisis earlier this year.
 ""The Irish thing is noise (but) is definitely a concern,""
Investec's Stopford said. ""It may not come to a head that
quickly. It is not going to go away.""
 
 FUNDAMENTALS
 What may stop Ireland from dragging financial markets into
another global crisis are the improved economic fundamentals
that exist now compared with earlier in the year.
 ""The renewed debt crisis will have no serious impact on euro
zone growth,"" Holger Schmieding, chief economist for wealth
managers and private bank Berenberg, said in a note.
 ""Remember that, while the Greek and euro crises raged
earlier this year, the euro zone economy had managed to
accelerate.""
Investors have been generally pleased by recent global
economic data, from China, the United States and the euro zone.
It has been part of the momentum behind the post-summer rally.
The coming week will tell them about U.S. housing, German
business confidence, British employment and how much demand
there is for Spanish debt, among other events.

 * Daimler investigation seen as test case for Medvedev drive
 * Daimler unit: ready to cooperate with any investigation
 
 By Guy Faulconbridge
 MOSCOW, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Russian prosecutors said on
Friday they had opened a criminal case into suspected fraud
connected to purchases by state agencies of Mercedes-Benz cars
from the Russian subsidiary of Germany's Daimler AG .
 Daimler paid $185 million in April to settle allegations it
had violated U.S. anti-bribery laws by giving state officials in
countries including Russia money and gifts to win contracts.
[ID:nN01141120]
 The Daimler investigation is seen by anti-graft campaigners
as a test case for President Dmitry Medvedev, who has repeatedly
vowed to crank up the fight against rampant corruption, but
analysts say there have been few results.
 ""A criminal case has been opened on suspicion of... fraud in
the conclusion of contracts to deliver Mercedes-Benz vehicles to
state authorities,"" the main investigative unit of the
Prosecutor-General said in a statement.
 ""The investigation is ongoing,"" it added, without saying
whom it was investigating.
 Both Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin are driven
around in heavily armoured Mercedes, the car of choice for
senior Russian officials.
 An official in the Prosecutor-General's main investigations
unit who agreed to talk to a Reuters reporter on condition of
anonymity said that the case had been opened after Daimler
admitted it had paid bribes in several countries.
 The U.S. Justice Department said in April that the Russian
subsidiary of Daimler, DaimlerChrysler Automotive Russia, which
is now known as Mercedes-Benz Russia, agreed to pay a fine for
breaching the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
 
 ""SILVER PLATTER""
 The unit admitted it had made improper payments to Russian
federal and municipal officials to secure contracts to sell
vehicles, according to the U.S. Justice Ministry.
 ""The U.S. Justice Ministry brings you the entire
investigation about Daimler on a silver platter and yet nothing
is done,"" Yelena Panfilova, head of the Russian branch of
watchdog Transparency International told reporters in Moscow
last month. [ID:nLDE69P12D]
 When asked about the probe, spokesman for Mercedes-Benz
Russia Andrei Ronionov said: ""We admitted our guilt. Our company
is always ready to cooperate with an investigation.""
 Russian state news agency RIA in April quoted an
unidentified official in the Federal Guards Service, which
provides security to Russia's top officials, as saying that an
internal investigation was underway focusing on its transport
arm, which provides cars for Russia's most powerful officials.
 No results of that probe have been released.
 Investors say corruption is one of the most serious barriers
to doing business in Russia, which Transparency International
rates as joint 154th out of 178 nations in its corruption
perceptions index, along with Cambodia, Kenya and Laos.

229,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2010 10:00AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-India likely to drip feed sugar to world," * Large block of Indian exports could drag on prices -trade
 * Indian industry lobbies for 2 mln tonnes exports -analysts
 
 By David Brough and Mayank Bhardwaj
 LONDON/NEW DELHI, Nov 12 (Reuters) - India is likely to
approve sugar exports bit by bit to prevent a shock to the
market and plug a supply gap until the next Brazilian harvest.
 Sugar market traders are on tenterhooks waiting for an
announcement expected by the end of the month on the amount of
sugar India will export.
 ICE raw sugar futures touched a 30-year high of 33.39 cents
a lb on Thursday after a prolonged rally driven by
lower-than-expected output in key producing countries due to
adverse weather. Raw sugar futures have more than doubled since
May.
 Analysts have revised estimates higher for output from
India, the world's number 2 producer after Brazil, and say that
it could make up for a supply shortfall before Brazil's next
harvest starts in April 2011.
 ""I think a lot of people in the market are looking to India
as part of the solution to Brazil's off-crop period,"" said Toby
Cohen, head of analysis at merchant Czarnikow.
 Indian millers, seeking to lock in high prices, have urged
authorities to approve 2 million tonnes of ""open general
licence"" (OGL) sugar exports in 2010/11, analysts say.
 But if India authorises the 2 million tonnes in one block,
that could trigger a shock sell-off, said Jonathan Kingsman,
managing director of Lausanne-based consultancy Kingsman SA.
 ""It seems that India will be drip feeding out sugar
exports,"" he said, echoing the views of several analysts and
traders.
 ""The market is now expecting the Indian government to
authorise exports in tranches of, say, 500,000 tonnes at a time,
spread over the next few months,"" Kingsman added.
 STRIKING A BALANCE
 Indian authorities also will want to strike a balance
between making sure the country has sufficient stocks and
helping sugar producers, a powerful lobby, analysts say.
 ""Even if the government allows exports under OGL, I do not
see the country exporting a large quantity,"" said Amol Tilak, an
analyst with Mumbai-based brokerage Kotak Commodities.
 ""The government will prefer to have a bigger buffer stock
(rather) than permit large quantities for export.""
 India is likely to produce 25.5 million tonnes of sugar in
2010/2011, up from 18.8 million tonnes a year ago, according to
the Indian Sugar Mills Association, a body of private producers.
 Indian analysts estimate Indian sugar stocks at around 5
million tonnes, less than a quarter of annual consumption.
 London-based merchant Czarnikow says stocks could be as low
as 4 million tonnes, which analysts consider to be tight.
 India consumes roughly 23 million tonnes a year of sugar. If
the government approves 2 million tonnes for export, that leaves
little room to boost stocks.
 Sanjay Tapriya, finance director of producer Simbhaoli
Sugars Ltd, said, ""I do not see India as a large exporter, but
there is some room for exports under OGL.
 ""Given current global prices, exports under OGL will help
mills improve their situation.""
 Part of India's decision may depend on the authorities' view
of likely sugar prices later in the year.
 A less likely scenario, analysts say, could be that India
decides not to allow exports because of fears that it would have
to import later at higher prices. Such a decision could trigger
an immediate price rally.
 On the other hand, Czarnikow's Cohen said India and some
other producers could export refined sugar now during the
inter-crop period, while prices are high, and then later import
raw sugar.
 Over the coming months sugar prices could decline if a
consensus emerges for a larger-than-expected Indian crop in the
year from October 2010 to September 2011.
 ""That will slowly creep into the market's consciousness,
rather than knock its legs out from under it,"" Kingsman said.
 ICE front-month raw sugar futures slid over 6 percent in
early trade on Friday, in a broad-based sell-off of commodities
and other markets on concerns over peripheral euro zone
economies' ability to service their debt.
 ICE March raw sugar futures were down 1.64 cent or 5.4
percent to 28.06 cents a lb at 1451 GMT.

(Adds quotes, detail, background)
 FRANKFURT, Nov 12 (Reuters) - All major currencies including
the Chinese yuan should eventually have free floating exchange
rates, European Central Bank Governing Council member Erkki
Liikanen said in a television interview.
 ""In the long term it is clear that all major currencies
should move and float freely,"" Liikanen, who also heads the Bank
of Finland, told a Finnish broadcaster in an interview conducted
on Thursday but published on its internet site on Friday.
 ""Then they reflect economic fundamentals and support
economic growth best. This is a major challenge for China.""
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said earlier this month a
steady rise in the yuan would help rebalance the world economy.
[ID:nL5506149]
 Liikanen also told television station MTV3 that excessive
foreign exchange volatility harmed economic growth and financial
stability. ""This is understood by all, and they respect this,
and that is very important.""
 He trusted U.S. policymakers when they said a strong dollar
was in their interests.
 Asked about the Federal Reserve's decision to purchase
government bonds, he said the U.S. central bank had taken into
account the current economic situation.
 The Fed's decision to buy $600 billion of debt has drawn
criticism from many other nations which contend it is generating
global instability by strengthening their currencies against the
dollar, inflating asset bubbles and fuelling inflation in their
economies.
 Liikanen also said all countries understand that
protectionism posed risks to getting the world economy on a
sustainable path.
 ""Free world trade is a central precondition for growth and
well-being,"" he said. ""Everyone understands that taking the
protectionist path would be damaging.""
 He declined to comment on whether Ireland might have to
apply for EU aid, but said that while it was good to have an
organisation such as the European Financial Stability Facility,
in the end all countries should solve their own problems.
 He also joined other ECB policymakers in calling for more
automatic sanctions for EU budget rule-breakers.

curb inflation to its own inflation target, and does not aim to
cut the target itself)
 
 * Govt CPI view hurts credibility of cbank target
 * Consumption recovery to be slower due to FX debt
 * Bank to publish new inflation report in Nov
 
 (Adds more comments, detail)
 BUDAPEST, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank is
committed to cutting inflation to its 3 percent target from
2012, the bank's deputy governor said on Friday, adding that
households' consumption would take some time to recover.
 ""Unfortunately we see that the government consistently ...
forecasts inflation above the 3 percent target, which means they
think we will never achieve it,"" Ferenc Karvalits told a
business meeting.
 ""This unfortunately does not help the credibility of this
target,"" he said. ""We are committed to reducing inflation to
this 3 percent target from 2012.""
 Hungary's headline inflation rate rose to 4.2 percent in
October on the back of a sharp increase in food prices. The
government forecasts inflation above the bank's 3 percent target
in the coming years.
 Karvalits said an indefinite extension of new windfall taxes
on the financial, energy, retail and telecommunication sectors
could also boost price pressures in the economy if companies
begin to factor them into their prices.
 The bank will publish its next update on inflation later
this month, which will be based on stronger exchange rates and
lower oil prices than its previous report issued in August, the
bank's governor, Andras Simor said on Thursday. [ID:nLDE6AA1KT]
 Karvalits added that a recovery in household consumption
would be more protracted than elsewhere in central Europe due to
the large stock of foreign currency debt in the sector after a
borrowing spree, mainly in Swiss francs, before the crisis.
 Most household loans were taken out at levels of around
150-160 forints versus the Swiss franc compared with around 208
on Friday, triggering a sharp rise in loan defaults and mounting
repayments for hundreds of thousands of families.
""Households want to exit, escape from debt, therefore, the
proportion of household savings have increased dramatically
during the crisis,"" Karvalits said.
 He said the level of household savings had risen to about
4-5 percent of gross domestic product from virtually zero before
the crisis and consumers were likely to remain tight-fisted
until loan repayments decline to lower levels.
 ""As long as the proportion of loan repayments remains above
10 percent of available income, households will likely opt for
savings instead, lending activity will be subdued and, as a
result, consumption will expand more slowly,"" Karvalits said.
 ""Therefore, a recovery in consumption will be much slower
than for example in the Czech Republic.""
 Hungary's economy grew by a higher-than-expected 1.6 percent
in the third quarter year-on-year, partly due to a modest
recovery in consumption. [ID:nLDE6AB0IW]
 The government expects household consumption to rise by 2.6
percent next year, helped by a planned cut in personal income
taxes, which will mostly benefit high-income earners and big
families.

233,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2010 09:20AM ET</span>",Quality coffee demand stable despite soaring prices," * Specialty coffee shops in U.S. see growth next year
 * Prize-winning coffee from auctions finding new markets
 By Mica Rosenberg
 SAN JOSE, Costa Rica, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Demand for
top-quality coffee sold in coffee shops and on grocery shelves
could still increase despite record prices that have pushed up
the cost per cup, industry sources say.
 An internal study last quarter by the Specialty Coffee
Association of America surveyed large and small coffeehouse
chains and independent coffee shops across the United States
and found more optimism about sales.
 The survey completed in October showed coffee sellers
predicted an 8 to 9 percent jump in sales over the next 12
months, up from an earlier forecast of 5 to 6 percent growth.
 Prices for arabica coffee, the bean used in the
highest-quality blends, skyrocketed to a 13-1/2-year high this
week, trading above $2.20 per lb, a cost that has been at least
partly passed on to coffee drinkers worldwide.
 But so far high-end coffee customers are not changing their
habits, Ric Rhinehart, SCAA executive director, said at the
Sintercafe coffee conference in San Jose this week.
 ""Once you've had good coffee it's hard to go back,""
Rhinehart told Reuters.
 While coffee houses have seen a 2 to 4 percent increase in
commodities costs, they have been able only to pass on a 1 to 2
percent increase in menu prices, the SCAA said.
 MORE SMALL ROASTERS
 In Europe, the story is mixed, with coffee consumption
falling in some countries but on the rise in others, said Mick
Wheeler from the Specialty Coffee Association of Europe.
 ""For the consumer, price is always a factor but it is never
the dominant factor,"" he said. People will often go to a coffee
shop or a convenience store with the express purpose of buying
coffee and are not discouraged by slight price rises.
 There has been some backlash against moves by large
roasters to use more low-quality, cheaper coffee in blends.
More small European roasters are offering an alternative by
specializing in premium beans.
 ""In the last year alone, there have been 15 to 20 new
micro-roasters who have joined my organization. In the United
Kingdom context that is an explosion,"" Wheeler said in an
interview.
 At the top end of the spectrum, award-winning coffee put up
for auction by the Cup of Excellence is also finding new
buyers, said the program's director, Susie Spindler.
 Some of the best coffee sold by individual farmers at
auction can fetch record prices of more than $100 per lb.
""You've got a lot more competition from different markets now,""
Spindler said. ""There are a lot of new companies coming on
board that want those coffees no matter what they cost.""

 NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Friday from
a six-week low against the dollar after Europeans leaders
sought to reassure nervous bondholders about the value of their
holdings.
 A statement from France, Germany, Italy, Spain and
Britain, issued at the Group of 20 summit in Seoul, said
bondholders would not be forced to writedown the value of their
bond holdings in the event of a new euro zone bailout, easing
pressure on Irish debt that has sparked fresh fears of
contagion.
 The euro responded to steady buying by macro funds as the
cost of insuring Irish, Spanish and Portuguese debt against
default fell.
 Speculation of a rescue package for Ireland added to the
euro's allure earlier in the global session though this was
later denied and the single currency fell from the session
peak.
 ""The fact that euro zone officials said Irish bond holders
don't have to take a haircut on their existing positions is
supportive for the euro,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market
analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange.
 Faith in the value of euro denominated debt bolsters
demand for the euro to buy it or conversely not to sell it and
seek safer havens in non euro denominated debt.
 The euro rose to a session high of $1.3751 well off the
session low of $1.3573 on EBS.
 It last traded at 1.3731 on Reuters data, up 0.6 percent
 The talk of a rescue package for Ireland as early as next
week was attributed to a U.S. think tank report. But the Irish
Finance ministry said market talk of a bailout package with the
EU was untrue.
 Two-thirds of economists and bond strategists polled by
Reuters on Thursday said Ireland would seek international
rescue funds before the end of next year.
 At the session low, the euro/dollar broke through the 38.2
percent fibonacci retracement, the 1.3631 level, of the move
from the August low to the November peak. The 50 percent
retracement comes at 1.3431, with the 61.8 percent at 1.3232.
 The euro has shed over 2 percent this week as long
positions built before the Fed's bond buying decision last week
have been unwound heading into the year-end book-closing
season.
 G-20
 Analysts said the communique from Group of 20 leaders
meeting in Seoul was mildly positive as it agreed to tackle
tensions that have threatened ""currency wars"" and trade
protectionism..
 The G-20 seemed to give the green signal to emerging
countries with flexible currency regimes to impose capital
controls.
 ""That seems to have hurt risk appetite a bit and investors
are booking profits in riskier assets,"" said Chris Turner, head
of FX strategy at ING in London.
The Australian dollar, a favorite among investors choosing
to buy into growth, sold off sharply. It shed more than 1
percent to as low as $0.9825, its lowest since Nov. 1. It was
last down 0.5 percent.
 Media reports suggested China was planning to limit
foreigners investing in its already speculative real estate
sector while South Korea was planning capital controls.
China's key stock index posted its biggest percentage loss in
14 months, ending down 5.2 percent on Friday on talk of more
monetary tightening.
 The euro fell to a two-month low against the yen, hitting
111.04 on EBS, but was last little changed at 112.74.
 The dollar fell against the yen, moving back towards its
15-year lows. It was down 0.5 percent at 82.15 yen, with
Japanese exporters selling into the dollar's recent bounce.

 ZURICH, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Swiss firms in the electrical,
machinery and metals sectors expect slower growth next year
after the industry booked the first rise in revenue in nearly
two years in the third quarter, lobby group Swissmem said.
 Third quarter sales posted the first year-on-year rise in
seven quarters though they surpassed the previous year's level
by just 0.1 percent, Swissmem said on Friday.
 But new orders growth weakened to 5 percent, versus an
increase of nearly 16 percent in the first half of the year.
 ""While Swissmem is expecting the current positive trend to
continue into 2011, the pace of growth may well slow,"" the
industry body said.
 Faster order growth in Germany highlights the impact the
strong Swiss franc had had on demand for products made in
Switzerland, Swissmem said.
 The franc has risen sharply since the Swiss National Bank
ended its interventions earlier this year and has hit record
highs against both the euro and the dollar.
 The Swiss economy has recovered strongly from last year's
recession and the central bank expects economic growth of around
2.5 percent this year.
 While the Swiss National Bank sees a marked slowdown next

moderate cooling so far.
 Swissmem said that the capacity utilisation in the industry
reached 85 percent in the third quarter, up from 76 percent in
the first quarter and just shy of the long-term average of 86
percent.

 LONDON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The euro bounced from six-week

reassure nervous bondholders and on speculation, quickly denied,
a rescue package for Ireland was being hammered out.
 The euro rose to a session high of $1.3745, rebounding

Portuguese debt against default fell after European Union

 Talk of a report by a U.S. think tank saying the EU planned
to hammer out a rescue package for Ireland as early as next week
also helped the euro.
 The Irish Finance ministry said market talk of a bailout
package with EU was untrue, pulling the euro off its highs to
trade at $1.3695.
 ""Ireland doesn't need to come to the market until mid 2011.
Lots of things can happen in six months and I don't see why they
would need a bailout now,"" said Adrian Schmidt, currency
strategist at Lloyds Banking Group.
 Two thirds of economists and bond strategists polled by
Reuters on Thursday said Ireland would seek international rescue
funds before the end of next year.
 Earlier a statement from France, Germany, Italy, Spain and
Britain, issued at the Group of 20 summit in Seoul, said
bondholders would not have to take a haircut under current debt
rules, allowing Irish bond yields to fall.
 Still, the euro has shed over 2 percent this week as long
positions built before the Fed's bond buying decision last week
have been unwound heading into the year-end book-closing season.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Concerns about severe fiscal
problems in Ireland that may eventually result in a Greek-style
bailout weighed down on shares and other riskier assets
including commodities on Friday.
 The euro came off earlier six-week lows versus the dollar,
however, while spreads between German and euro zone peripheral
bond yields narrowed from elevated levels on market talk a
rescue package for Ireland was being agreed, although this was
denied by an Irish finance ministry spokesman.
 Market sentiment was also helped after EU leaders sought to
reassure bondholders they would not be forced to take a
writedown, although jitters about the severity of the situation
remained.
 Global stocks fell, with the MSCI world equity index down
0.5 percent. European shares were down 0.7 percent, having
earlier lost more than 1 percent, while U.S. equity futures
indicated a lower open on Wall Street.
 Emerging stocks came under particularly heavy pressure,
dropping by 1.4 percent.
 ""There are too many uncertainties on investors' minds about
euro peripheral debt and they are rushing to the door. These
sovereign debt problems are a trigger to book profits in
commodities and emerging markets assets,"" said Jane Foley,
senior currency strategist at Rabobank.
 This followed sharp falls in Asian stocks, led by a 5.2
percent drop in the Shanghai composite index -- the biggest
single-day decline since May -- on talk of more monetary
tightening and a scramble out of resource-related shares.
 The euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.3686 against the dollar,
having earlier hit a six-week low of 1.3573 on EBS trading
platform.

 PERIPHERAL SPREADS, COMMODITIES
 The premium demanded to hold Irish 10-year bonds over German
bonds narrowed from record high levels.
 But nervousness about Ireland and other troubles in
peripheral euro zone countries kept yield spreads elevated, with
the premium for holding Spanish and Italian over German bonds
rising to euro lifetime highs in early trade.
 ""I would suggest this is just a relief pause and it's just
going to fuel expectations that the Irish are eventually going
to have to go to the (European Financial Stability Fund),"" said
James Knightley, an economist at ING.
 German bund futures fell 46 ticks at 129.58.
 The dollar was steady against a basket of major currencies.
 A broad retreat from riskier assets pushed oil prices down
nearly 2 percent to $86.07 per barrel, retreating from a
25-month high reached the previous session, while gold prices
fell 1.6 percent.

 LONDON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The euro bounced from six-week
lows against the dollar on Friday as EU leaders sought to
reassure nervous bondholders and on speculation, quickly denied,

 The euro rose to a session high of $1.3745, up 0.5 percent,
rebounding smartly from its low of $1.3573 on EBS. It moved up

 * Merkel's popularity slumps due to backlash over measure
 
 By Erik Kirschbaum
 BERLIN, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The German parliament passed
healthcare reform on Friday to overhaul the country's
cash-strapped insurance system and plug a threatened 11-billion
euro shortfall in the public health system next year.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel's centre-right coalition has called
the healthcare reform bill one of its most important laws this
year, even though her Christian Democrats have clashed for
months over details with their Free Democrat coalition partners.
 Along with savings, healthcare insurance levies will be
raised for employers and for the country's 72 million insured.
Anger over the rising health insurance costs has contributed to
a prolonged slump in polls for Merkel's coalition.
 The mandatory health insurance charge now split evenly
between employers and workers will rise from January to 15.5
percent of gross wages in January from 14.9 percent. Any future
increases will be paid for only by employers.
 The measure has been widely attacked by opposition parties,
trade unions and insurers. They complain the reforms' focus was
on raising levies rather than cutting costs. They also criticise
that employers must pay future increases on their own.
 The issue also provoked slanging matches inside Merkel's
government for months, threatening unity in her coalition.
 ""This law will make the healthcare system better and
fairer,"" Health Minister Philipp Roesler told parliament. ""I'd
have preferred bigger steps. But small steps forward are better
than big steps backwards.""
 Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a leader of the opposition Social
Democrats, said Roesler was wrecking ""one of the best healthcare
systems in the world"".
 Analysts said the healthcare reform fell short of deeper
structural reforms needed and concentrated on raising revenues.
 Germany's highly regarded health system covers 72 million
people via state health insurance and 8.5 million via private
schemes, according to health ministry data. It employs 4.3
million people and accounts for 11 percent of economic output.
 On Thursday parliament approved a set of related rules that
limit the power of pharmaceutical companies to set prices in
Europe's biggest market, in an effort to cut costs for the
health insurance system by some 2 billion euros.
 The measure limits the amount that pharmaceutical firms are
allowed to charge for prescription drugs.

 By Michael Winfrey
 PRAGUE, Nov 12 (Reuters) - A German-backed manufacturing and
export revival in emerging central Europe lifted growth above
expectations in the third quarter, and the momentum should allow
some countries to avoid a previously expected year-end slowdown.
 The open and export-heavy economies of Slovakia, the Czech
Republic and Hungary beat analysts' forecasts for July-September
growth, mainly on double-digit jumps in industrial output tied
to their key role in supplying a German exports surge to Asia.
 Friday's data follow signs of a small pickup in household
spending in those countries. If sustained, that could signal
growth in industry could be feeding domestic demand, which
economists say would be the key turning point to recovery.
 But it also indicates a two-speed recovery is underway, as
the countries on the EU's Baltic and Balkan fringes that had to
raise taxes and slash spending at the height of the crisis still
suffer from high unemployment, lower wages, and weak demand.
 ""Everything's surprising on the upside. The Czech Republic,
Slovakia and Hungary expanded more than we expected, while
Romania didn't contract as much as we had expected,"" said Neil
Shearing, an economist at London-based Capital Economics.
 ""Industry remains the key driver particularly. That's down
to strong ties with industry in Germany.""
 The Czech Republic led the way with growth of 1.1 percent on
a quarterly basis and 3.0 percent from a year earlier. It
eclipsed median forecasts in a Reuters poll that had expected
rises of 0.6 and 2.5 percent.
 Hungary grew by an annual 1.6 percent, beating market
forecasts of 1.1 percent. It was helped by a lower base and a
pickup in household consumption., which expanded for the first
time since early 2007.
 Romania also beat expectations, but only by shrinking a
less-than-expected 0.7 percent quarter-on-quarter. Following
austerity measures that are aimed at cutting the public spending
deficit almost 3 percentage points to 4.4 percent from
2009-2011, the economy is expected to shrink by around 2 percent
this year.
 Emerging Europe's currencies made limited gains, as the
growth data was tempered by renewed risk aversion on continued
concerns about the euro, the region's reference currency.
 Hungary's forint was 0.45 percent higher on the day at 1010
GMT. The Czech crown was up 0.06 percent and the Romanian leu
0.13 percent.
 
 PRO-GROWTH VS AUSTERITY
 Exports account for 60 percent or more of the Czech, Slovak
and Hungarian economies, and because Germany is their biggest
customer, that country's prospects are key to their recoveries.
 The news there was mixed. Germany grew 0.7 percent
quarter-on-quarter, a slowdown from the previous three months
but one analysts said the quality of growth improved as private
consumption had increased.
 That trend -- an improvement in household spending -- showed
possible signs of picking up slightly in central Europe, with
Czech retail sales growing 3.5 percent in September and
Hungarian domestic demand rising for the first time since 2007.
 A different story, however, is unfolding in Romania,
Bulgaria, and the Baltic states, most of which have made
double-digit cuts to public wages and pensions to arrest their
slides into potential national bankruptcies earlier this year.
 Bulgaria's gross domestic product grew 0.2 percent on an
annual basis after a 0.3 percent contraction from April to June,
while earlier this week data showed Latvia's economy grew 2.7
percent, it's first annual expansion in two years.
 Although all countries showed better-than-expected third
quarter results, they are still suffering from the effects of
belt-tightening and their economies are still at least 10
percent smaller in nominal terms than before the crisis.
 In the middle of all of this is Hungary, a country that has
the strong exports of the Czechs and Slovaks but is also
struggling to overcome a deep economic slowdown and years of
austerity measures. 
 Its government is eschewing belt tightening in favour of a
pro-growth strategy that includes taxes on banks, utilities, and
other mainly foreign firms and a transfer of private pension
contributions to state coffers.
 The moves have shocked markets and cast a pall over the
business environment as companies have a cloudy view of future
tax regimes, but they will also ease the tax burden on consumers
while cutting the fiscal deficit.
 ""We may look back in 12 months and say the Hungarian
government's actions were not so bad after all, given that if
they had moved down the same way as Romania, we would have been
in a similar situation there,"" said Simon Quijano-Evans, an
economist at brokerage Cheuvreux.

(Recasts, adds detail, changes dateline to Geneva, adds byline)
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Leaders of the G20 rich and
emerging economies called on Friday for intensified efforts to
complete the long-running Doha round of global trade talks,
saying next year offers a narrow window of opportunity.
 The endorsement by the G20 summit of 2011 as a target date,
even if not an explicit one, marks an optimistic return to the
practice of summits setting deadlines for the Doha talks,
launched nine years ago this Sunday.
 Each one has been missed, starting with the original target
of Jan. 1, 2005. But this time may be different.
 There is a growing sense of optimism at the World Trade
Organization in Geneva -- after several months of brainstorming
among small groups of ambassadors -- that the negotiations could
be ready for a final push.
 What the negotiators had been waiting for was a political
signal from the leaders in Seoul.
 In a statement released after a two-day summit, the G20
leaders welcomed what they called the ""broader and more
substantive"" engagement of the past four months among
negotiators in Geneva.
 
 NARROW WINDOW
 ""Bearing in mind that 2011 is a critical window of
opportunity, albeit narrow, this engagement must intensify and
expand. We now need to complete the end game,"" the G20 said.
 World leaders have been issuing such exhortations for
several years. 
 But this time U.S. President Barack Obama and other leaders
were forthright in their support for a deal, a senior trade
source said.
 Obama told other leaders at a lunchtime discussion on trade
that he would take a deal to Congress and fight for it, once the
right deal was on the table, the source said.
 ""What I get from this summit is political energy and a sense
that next year is the year when we have to try and wrap it up,""
said the source, who took part in summit meetings in Seoul.
 The talks were launched in late 2001 to free up global
commerce and help poor countries prosper through trade.
 The likely deal would see rich countries cut their trade
distorting agricultural subsidies and open their protected farm
markets, while emerging economies would open up their fledgling
industries to more international competition. The poorest
countries would not have to make any concessions.
 But the talks have been stuck for two years on a U.S. demand
that emerging economies -- where most future growth is likely --
should create more opportunities for foreign businesses. The
emerging countries say they have already done enough in what is
supposed to be a negotiation to help developing countries.
 Obama's reassurance that he will fight for the right deal is
important because over the past two years many countries have
argued that a virtual deadlock in the talks was due to a lack of
interest on the part of the United States.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister
David Cameron spoke up at the lunch for a Doha deal to bolster
the world economy, and in other sessions outgoing Brazilian
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Chinese President Hu
Jintao also called for progress, the senior trade source said.
 EU trade chief Karel De Gucht is thinking of convening a
meeting of key trade ministers in the coming months to move the
talks forward, other sources said.
 But Seoul also saw calls for the launch of several new
bilateral or regional trade agreements and a promise by the
United States and South Korea to try and conclude their trade
pact that they had hoped to agree by the summit.
 That suggests many countries are hedging their bets over
Doha.
 ""My worry would be that bilateral agreements suck so much
energy out of the negotiating teams that there's no energy left
for the multilateral talks,"" the trade source said.

(Adds details, background)
 By Sarah Marsh and Annika Breidthardt 
 BERLIN, Nov 12 (Reuters) - German economic growth slowed in
the July-September period but the upswing in Europe's largest
economy is now on a broad and firm footing, pointing to solid,
if unspectacular growth in coming quarters.
 Gross domestic product grew 0.7 percent in the third
quarter, according to preliminary quarter-on-quarter data from
the Federal Statistics Office released on Friday, exactly in
line with the Reuters consensus forecast. 
 That was a sharp slowdown from the April-June period, as a
gloomy global outlook still casts a shadow over exports.
 Second-quarter growth was revised up 10 basis points to 2.3
percent, the fastest rate in reunified Germany.
 ""Positive impulses came both from the domestic side as well
as from abroad,"" the Statistics Office said in a statement.
 The expansion was driven equally by private and public
spending, investment and trade, the office said.
 ""The slowdown is no cause for concern. The upwards trend is
still in place, in part due to the fact the economy is now on a
broader footing. We think the economy will continue to recover
in coming quarters,"" said Alexander Krueger of Bankhaus Lampe.
 ""High competitiveness is one of the reasons for this, which
is helping exports to grow strongly, which in turn is also
helping to boost domestic demand,"" Krueger added.
 
 ON TWO LEGS NOW
 ""The quality of growth has improved. The German economy is
no longer just standing on one leg -- exports,"" said Andreas
Rees, an economist at Unicredit. ""By the first or second quarter
of 2011 we'll have reached the pre-crisis level. A few months
ago no-one would have thought that would be possible,"" he added.
 Germany suffered its biggest postwar recession in 2009 when
the economy contracted by 4.7 percent. Driven by exports and
helped by stronger-than-usual consumer sentiment, it has emerged
from the slump -- leaving behind some euro zone peers.
 Austerity measures to slash the deficit are squeezing
economic activity in a number of European states. 
 But Germany's economy is proving more resilient than others
so far to budget cutbacks, a subdued global trade environment
and a strong euro.
 Germany's economy -- the driver of euro zone growth -- is
expected to expand by 3.4 percent this year and by 1.8 percent
in 2011, according to government forecasts last month.
 
 WIDER GAP
 Output data from a number of euro zone countries on Friday
should show the debt crisis is widening the gaps between
economies such as Germany and France and those still struggling
to cut their debt and secure growth.
 France's economy grew 0.4 percent in the third quarter,
slowing from growth of 0.7 percent in the second quarter,
preliminary data showed on Friday.
 By contrast, in debt-laden Greece, the economy probably
slumped by 1.4 percent in the third quarter, slowing from the
previous three months' 1.8 percent fall.
 Spain's economy stagnated in the third quarter, lagging
behind the euro zone core and fuelling prospects of a prolonged
period in the doldrums with robust exports overshadowed by
persistently weak domestic demand.
 Data are also due from the currency bloc as a whole at 1000
GMT, with growth expected to have slowed to 0.4 percent quarter
on quarter from a 1 percent increase in the second quarter.
 German businesses are still profiting from the rebound.
 The blue chip DAX index has gained 13 percent since the
start of the year, and of the 30 companies in the index, 20 beat
market expectations with their earnings in the quarter to
end-September and 15 hiked their outlooks.
 Siemens, Europe's biggest engineering firm, has signalled
its confidence with a proposed sharp rise in dividends and a
promise of profit growth driven by emerging markets.
 Year-on-year, the German economy grew by 3.9 percent in the
third quarter, the data showed. This followed a revised 4.3
percent expansion in the April-June period and beat expectations
for a 3.7-percent growth year on year.

251,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2010 02:36AM ET</span>","G20 growth forecasts ""distinctly optimistic""-IMF"," By Emily Kaiser
 SEOUL, Nov 12 (Reuters) - G20 countries' growth forecasts
look ""distinctly optimistic"" and they could miss deficit
reduction goals if the economy does not live up to their lofty
expectations, the IMF warned in a report released on Friday.
 The findings show only limited progress toward a Group of 20
goal of rebalancing the global economy, with current accounts
expected to widen again toward pre-crisis levels.
 The G20 agreed last year to a ""Mutual Assessment Process""
that involved submitting medium-term forecasts for International
Monetary Fund review to determine whether national economic
policies clashed globally.
 If G20 countries adopt mutually beneficial policies, the IMF
estimated 2014 GDP could be 2 percent, or $1 trillion, higher
than would otherwise be the case, and 25 million more jobs would
be created.
 G20 countries submitted a first round of projections in
April, but the IMF said at the time they looked overly ambitious.
The resubmitted figures included lower growth targets, yet the
forecasts ""remain distinctly optimistic compared to past
recoveries,"" the IMF said in the report, which was dated October
2010 but publicly released on Friday.
 Collectively, the forecasts show G20 growth at 5 percent in
2014. That would be a step-up from next year's pace, which the
IMF has pegged at 4.2 percent.
 This mutual assessment process is at the heart of G20 efforts
to smooth out imbalances between export-rich countries such as
China and debt-burdened importers including the United States.
The G20 authorized the IMF to release this report, but has yet to
agree specifics on the next step -- setting up a monitoring
system designed to spot imbalances that could destabilize the
global economy.
 The IMF said G20 countries were ""broadly on track"" to meet
commitments agreed in Toronto in June to halve deficits by 2013,
but warned that the budget projections rested on optimistic
growth forecasts and could fall short.
 Although G20 countries had trimmed their GDP forecasts since
April, they predicted unemployment would fall even faster than
initially anticipated. They estimated unemployment would return
to its pre-crisis average level by 2014.
 ""A less optimistic growth outlook and a more optimistic
employment outlook are not necessarily incompatible,"" the IMF
said. ""However, policy frameworks have not adequately explained
the basis for better projected labor market outcomes against the
deterioration in growth outcomes.""
 WHAT COULD GO WRONG?
 The IMF said risks to growth had risen since the Toronto
summit, and listed among its concerns a still-fragile financial
system, sovereign debt risks, weak real estate markets, trade
protectionism, and currency instability.
 ""Overall, the stance of G20 monetary policies remains broadly
appropriate given members' circumstances, but greater exchange
(rate) flexibility in major emerging economies is essential for
meeting the growth objectives agreed by leaders,"" the IMF wrote.
 Another area of concern was the interplay between
slow-growing advanced economies and fast-growing emerging
markets, which has become a growing source of global friction.
 If debt-burdened rich countries retrench, but emerging
markets don't pick up the slack, a ""demand deficit"" could
develop, undermining the recovery.
 It said exchange rate and other policies that could
strengthen emerging market domestic demand were ""not adequately
spelled out"" in the information submitted to the IMF.
 The IMF has said repeatedly that China's tightly managed
exchange rate remains undervalued, but did not specifically
comment on that in this report.
 In the only direct mention of the yuan it said: ""China
recently announced a return to a more flexible exchange rate
regime. The RMB (yuan) has appreciated less than 2 percent
against the U.S. dollar since the policy announcement, but
day-to-day exchange rate volatility has increased markedly.""

 * To meet with Obama, Strauss-Kahn, Zuma to discuss agenda
 
 (Recasts, adds details throughout)
 By Yann Le Guernigou
 SEOUL, Nov 12 (Reuters) - President Nicolas Sarkozy said the
G20 had tasked France's presidency of the group with setting the
criteria for measuring an excessive trade deficit, preferably by
the middle of 2011.
 Sarkozy, who takes the presidency of the G20 after this
week's summit in Seoul, said he would meet with US President
Barack Obama either later this year or early in 2011 to discuss
France's ambitious agenda of pushing ahead with reform of the
global monetary system.
 On Friday, Leaders from the G20 group of developed and
emerging nations agreed in Seoul to a watered-down commitment to
watch out for dangerous trade imbalances using ""indicative
guidelines"", but left the details to be discussed in the first
half of next year. [ID:nN11196971]
 ""We do not have an agreement on the criteria, but we agree
on that fact that there will be criteria, and we must define
them under the French presidency, preferably before the summer.
That we are agreed upon,"" Sarkozy told a news conference after
the summit.
 ""On the reform of the international monetary system, the G20
for the first time indicates that its object is to build an
international monetary system more stable and resistant: it has
asked the IMF to work on that and it has given the French
presidency a mandate to arrive at this objective,"" he said.
 Sarkozy said he would also holds talks with IMF Managing
Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn in Paris in December, and would
also travel to South Africa for talks with President Jacob Zuma.
 In an effort to build a broader international consensus for
France's three point reform agenda at the helm of the G20 --
which includes plans to reform global governance and tackle
volatility in commodities markets -- Sarkozy said he would
travel to an African Union summit in January in the Ethiopian
capital Addis Ababa.
 The French president, who hopes to use the G20 presidency as
a launching pad to boost his flagging poll ratings ahead of 2012
elections, said no progress would be made if G20 members wasted
their time reproaching each other.
 Sarkozy, who met with Chinese President Hu Jintao in France
last week, singled out Beijing for praise -- despite criticism
from Washington that China must do more to appreciate its yuan
currency.
 ""Our Chinese friends are agreed to host in China in the
spring the first working seminar on the reform of the
international monetary system and I am very grateful to
President Hu for accepting that,"" Sarkozy said.

 * Q3 GDP boosted by doubling of consumer spending growth

(Recasts with quotes, details, background)
 By Leigh Thomas
 PARIS, Nov 12 (Reuters) - French growth decelerated slightly
more than expected in the third quarter as increased consumer
spending failed to offset the impact of a slower rebuilding of
companies' inventories, according to preliminary data on Friday.
 National statistics office INSEE said third-quarter gross
domestic product expanded 0.4 percent in the third quarter
versus the previous three-month period, slowing from 0.7 percent
in the second quarter.
 The result came in marginally below the average forecast of
a Reuters poll for 0.5 percent growth, and confirmed France
continued to lag the euro zone's economic powerhouse Germany,
which posted growth of 0.7 percent in the third quarter.
 For the 16-nation euro zone as a whole, third quarter growth
more than halved to 0.4 percent versus the previous three
months, in line with forecasts.
 ""Domestic spending is holding quite firmly and is clearly
underpinning this super-soft landing in the second half of
2010,"" Deutsche Bank economist Gilles Moec said.
 ""There is no major deceleration compared with where we were
in the spring, but we have not yet tested French domestic
spending for the impact of fiscal consolidation, which is
starting in January,"" he added.
 Consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of
France's 1.9 trillion euro economy, doubled in the
July-September period to 0.6 percent quarter-on-quarter.
 Growth in companies' inventories, which had driven the
second-quarter GDP surge, slowed to 0.3 percent, half the rate
seen in the second quarter.
 Total capital investment grew to 0.5 percent as imports
expanded 4.1 percent and exports rose by 4.1 percent.
 ""The details show that the deceleration was mainly due to
the fact that the positive stimulus from companies rebuilding
their inventories diminished, while export growth inched down,""
ABN AMRO economist Joost Beaumont said.
 ""On the other hand, data showed that private consumption
picked up,"" he added.
 Economist Mar Touati at brokerage Global Equities said that
strong household spending ""owes its vigour to the end of (car)
scrapping bonuses"" during the quarter as consumers rushed to
take advantage of the promotions.
 French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said in reaction
to the data that the outlook for the fourth quarter remained
solid.
 ""Companies are starting to invest. The acceleration in
household spending reflects the favourable effects of the labour
market's stabilisation,"" she said in statement.
 The Bank of France forecast on Tuesday that would escape a
sharp slowdown in growth in the second half of the year,
estimating that growth would pick up to 0.5 percent in the final
three months of the year.

finance ministers on Friday to draw up indicative guidelines to
spot large current account imbalances that threaten to
destabilise the global economy.
 The guidelines, which will be composed of a range of
indicators, will help with the timely identification of
imbalances that ""require preventive and corrective actions to be
taken"", according to a communique issued after a two-day summit
of the Group of 20 major economies.
 Ministers will work with the International Monetary Fund on
developing the guidelines, with progress to be discussed in the
first half of next year.
 A draft version of the communique had shown the G20 was
undecided whether to describe the guidelines as ""measurable"" or
as ""quantitative and qualitative"".
 In the end, no description was used.
 The G20 declared global recovery to be continuing but with
downside risks and said tensions and vulnerabilities in the
international monetary system were clearly apparent.
 Adopting the language agreed by finance ministers when they
met in Gyeongju, South Korea, last month, the leaders pledged to
move towards market-determined exchange rate systems and to
enhance currency flexibility to reflect economic fundamentals.
 Advanced economies will guard against disorderly exchange
rate movements, which will help mitigate the risk of excessive
volatility in capital flows facing some emerging economies, the
communique said.
 In that context, the G20 said those emerging economies with
increasingly overvalued exchange rates that face an undue burden
of adjustment would be justified in taking ""carefully designed
macro-prudential measures"" to counter capital inflows.

 By Kevin Plumberg
 HONG KONG, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Friday on
fears Ireland may need a bailout just like Greece, while a
sharp decline in commodities and stock prices hastened a broad
retreat from risky assets.
 Major European stock markets opened lower, with the
FTSEurofirst 300 falling 0.7 percent <.FTEU3> and London's FTSE
100 down 1.2 percent <.FTSE>. U.S. stock index futures dropped
1.2 percent.
 Asian stocks were broadly lower, led by a 5 percent drop in
the Shanghai composite index <.SSEC> -- the biggest single-day
decline since May -- on lingering talk of interest rate
increases and a scramble out of resource-related shares. Plain
old profit taking was also the culprit.
 This year has been difficult for many investors because of
the sudden shifts in risk taking on everything from the
sovereign debt crisis in Europe, fears of both a slowdown and
overheating in China and U.S. double dipping back into
recession, causing havoc to trading strategies.
 As a result, many may be prone to take profits -- or losses
-- and wait for 2011.

 The possibility of a government bailout for Ireland has
significantly widened the difference of bond yields of
high-risk European countries over those of Germany, and
overshadowed a Group of 20 leaders' summit in Seoul, where mere
guidelines were called for to spot economic imbalances.
[ID:nN11196971]
 ""The effects of euro zone peripheral bond concerns are
spreading through euro zone markets and hitting risk appetite
in the process. The euro is a clear casualty, having dropped
further against the U.S. dollar and versus other currencies,""
said Mitul Kotecha, global head of currency strategy with
Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.
 The resurgence of fears about Europe's sovereign debt has
added to a shift back into dollars and out of riskier assets.
 Traders slowed their selling of euros a bit after knocking
the currency down 4 cents in the past week, squaring up before
a statement about Ireland that may be issued by Britain and
France later in the day. [ID:nASN000049]
 The euro was down 0.3 percent against the U.S. dollar at
$1.3625  after tumbling 0.9 percent on Thursday.
 A close below the 200-week moving average of $1.3647 is a
grim omen for the euro and paves the way to the next obstacle
lower at $1.3558, the Sept. 30 low.
 The dollar was down 0.2 percent against the yen, at 82.34
yen .
 The dollar has been rebounding ever since the Federal
Reserve unveiled its $600 billion plan to buy Treasuries on
Nov. 3. The dollar index <.DXY>, which measures the dollar's
performance against a basket of other major currencies, has
risen 3.3 percent since then to a 5-week high.
 COMMODITISED NEWS
 Commodities traders had barely blinked at the dollar's
gains earlier in the week but prices succumbed to profit taking
on Friday. Historical chart patterns also suggested a deeper
move lower was in the cards for metals.
 Three-month copper traded on the London Metal Exchange was
down 2.2 percent to $8,630.50 a tonne  after hitting a
record high of $8,966 on Thursday.
 The corrective move lower could ultimately continue to
$8,553, the 50 percent retracement of the rise to $8,966 from
$8,140.
 U.S. crude futures fell 1.8 percent to $86.31 a barrel
, though were still up 5.9 percent so far in November,
having risen for the past two months.
 Equities in Asia were mostly softer, with mainland Chinese
markets chalking up the biggest declines, though strategists
were generally not concerned about the longer-term outlook.
 ""Dollar strong, Asia weak. I think there's much beyond
that,"" Markus Rosgen, Asia equity strategist with Citi in Hong
Kong, said.
 ""After this week, investors just don't want to hold a lot
of inventory over the weekend ... So sell on Friday and come
back Monday.""
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan was
down 2.1 percent <.MIAPJ0000PUS>, with financials and telecom
sectors under the most selling pressure. The index is on the
way to its biggest weekly drop since July, down 3.2 percent.
 It has had a strong inverse relationship with the dollar
over the past few months, with the rolling 90-day correlation
between the MSCI index and the dollar index at -0.95, meaning
basically when one falls, the other rises and vice versa.
 The Hang Seng index <.HSI> was down 1.9 percent, with bank
stocks weighing on the market.
 Japan's Nikkei share average was down 1.4 percent <.N225>
but was still poised to post a 1 percent rise on the week.
 Some stocks such as Canon Inc <7751.T> that led the Nikkei
higher this week were the main drags on Friday, suggesting
profit taking was an element weighing on the market.

 By Jack Kim
 SEOUL, Nov 12 (Reuters) - South Korean officials struck an
upbeat note on Friday that discussions to iron out U.S.
concerns about a free trade deal they signed three years ago
would conclude soon despite missing a deadline set by their
leaders.
 But there was also concern that outstanding differences on
the autos and beef trade that hampered progress on the deal
could take months if not another several years to resolve.
 ""I can tell you ... that the differences have been narrowed
through the tireless discussion at various levels, and we are
very hopeful of resuming talks and reaching a mutually
agreeable resolution within the next few weeks,"" South Korea's
ambassador to the United States, Han Duk-soo, told Reuters.
 The two sides failed to revive the stalled deal on Thursday
when their leaders met on the sidelines of a G20 summit in
Seoul, dealing a setback to a longstanding effort to boost
trade.
 The deal, if ratified by the two countries' assemblies,
would be one of the largest free trade pacts ever and the
largest signed by the United States since the North American
Free Trade Agreement that went into effect in 1994.
 Studies said the deal would boost the $66.7 billion annual
two-way trade by as much as a quarter. South Korea's automakers
stand to gain with much greater access to the U.S. market.
 U.S. farm products and machinery are also expected to be
winners.
 Trade envoys meeting since last week could not conclude
negotiations to resolve U.S. industry and lawmakers' concerns
that the deal does not do enough to open South Korea's market
to U.S. autos and beef.
 The concerns raised by U.S. lawmakers have been the primary
reason holding up deliberation by U.S. Congress.
 South Korea's parliament has introduced the bill to the
floor but discussions had stalled pending movement in the U.S.
Congress. There is a broad support for the deal in President
Lee Myung-bak's ruling Grand National Party, which controls the
unicameral house.
 BEEF POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE
 Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Wendy Cutler met South
Korea's chief free trade negotiator on Friday in a three-hour
session seen as coordinating discussions in weeks ahead.
 ""We had the presidents pledging their commitment yesterday
to continued discussions, so (the officials) are meeting to
coordinate, rather than getting right into in-depth talks,"" a
South Korean Trade Ministry official said.
 Cutler declined to answer questions as she left the office
of Deputy Minister for Trade Choi Seok-young.
 Kwon Young-min, an expert on free trade negotiations at
Myongji University in Seoul, said if autos were the only
sticking point, a deal could be in reach, but any insistence by
Washington to take up the issue of South Korea's restrictive
import of U.S. beef would mean more complications.
 ""Beef is a very serious issue, something that President Lee
will be unable to give away even if he wanted to, given the
incredible impact of what he went through two years ago.""
 Lee's months-old administration was thrown into political
paralysis in 2008 because of big street protests after he
accepted U.S. demands for greater beef market opening.
 The two sides later struck a ""voluntary private sector
agreement"" banning the import of beef from cattle older than 30
months, which is considered to pose a greater risk of mad cow
disease.

 * Ireland remains in spotlight; G20 not seen conclusive
 * Dollar's rise blocked at 82.50 yen area
 By Chikafumi Hodo and Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The euro hit six-week lows
on the dollar on Friday, dipping below $1.3600 as investors
closed long positions and as renewed concerns about Ireland's
ability to pay its debt kept up selling pressure.
 The euro, which fell nearly 1 percent on Thursday, has shed
about 3 percent this week as long positions built up into the
Federal Reserve's bond buying decision last week have been
unwound heading into the year-end book-closing season.
 On the charts it has support at $1.3558 and then $1.3532, its
55-day moving average. Liquidity is thinning out and the market
has been whippy as investors have liquidated longs.
 Traders are watching G20 leaders meeting in Seoul as they
labour to tackle currency strains, but they were expected to
agree just indicative guidelines on global imbalances and leave
the details until next year, sources said.
 Asian share markets were in the red, Asian traders were
nervous about possible curbs on capital flows in South Korea, and
yen crosses, such as Australian dollar/yen, traded lower as
investors took money out of commodities and risk assets.
 ""It's hard to say if this is the start of a more material
move in terms of risk aversion, lower equities and a stronger
dollar, or if this just a correction which will be unwound after
the G20,"" said a senior trader in Hong Kong.
 He expected it was more a correction. ""But ... there's
clearly position liquidation in the market and I would take cues
from equities next week.""
 The single currency dipped as far as $1.3590 and the dollar
index, a measure of its performance against six currencies,
pushed above resistance at an October high.
 ""Sentiment for the euro turned even weaker after breaking
below $1.37,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager at Okasan
Securities' foreign securities section.
 ""In general, the market is keen to cover the dollar (short)
positions due to growing concerns over debt problems in Ireland
and other European countries.""
 The 10-year Irish government bond yield has
rocketed to 9 percent making it the second highest yielding euro
zone bond after Greece.
 Two thirds of economists and bond strategists polled by
Reuters on Thursday believe Ireland will seek international
rescue funds before the end of next year.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the European Union was
ready to deal with all scenarios in the Irish financial crisis.
 All this was likely to keep pressure on the single currency,
dealers said. It fell 0.5 percent on the day to $1.3600, 0.6
percent to 112.06 yen, and hit a record low against the
Australian dollar. Against the pound, it hit a 7-week low around
84.50 pence.
 The dollar, in a decline for weeks in anticipation of more
quantitative easing from the Fed, has benefited as months-old
short positions unwind.
 Against a basket of major currencies, the greenback has risen
3.5 percent from a near one-year low set last week and was last
at 78.43 after taking out resistance around 78.36. The next
resistance level is seen at its 50-day moving average currently
at 78.70.
 The dollar bought 82.40 yen, little changed from
late New York levels. It has recovered from a 15-year low of
80.21 yen at the start of the month to 82.80 yen this week but
traders say sell orders from players such as Japanese exporters
are lined up between 82.50-83.00 yen.
 On the charts, the dollar's 55-day moving average comes in at
82.87 yen and chartists note it has not traded above that average
since June, when it peaked above that level for two sessions.
That is also its Sept. 15 pre-intervention low of 82.87 yen.
 Some analysts caution that the dollar is still likely to be
hampered by the fact that the Fed has committed to injecting more
stimulus into the economy, effectively keeping U.S. rates
low and making it an attractive funding currency.
 For now though the euro zone debt woes were helping it and
curbing appetite for risk assets. The Australian dollar slid
below parity against the greenback to trade 0.7 percent down at
$0.9902. It fell 1 percent to 81.53 yen.

264,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2010 01:32AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-China wants more jobs at IMF for emerging markets," SEOUL, Nov 12 (Reuters) - More jobs in the upper ranks of
international financial institutions should go to people from
emerging economies, President Hu Jintao said on Friday.
 In a speech to a summit of the Group of 20 major economies,
Hu welcomed a recent shift in voting power at the International
Monetary Fund to give developing countries more say in the
running of the Washington-based lender.
 ""The reform of international financial institutions is a long
and dynamic process. Quota and voting power reforms are just a
starting point and much remains to be done,"" Hu said.
 He added: ""We should continue to push for fair and
merit-based selection of the management of international
financial institutions, enable more people from the developing
countries to take up mid-level and senior management positions
and redress the under-representation of developing countries at
the management level in the institutional framework of
international financial institutions.""
 China's delegation released an English-language version of
his remarks.
 There are few Chinese in senior positions at IFIs.
 Zhu Min, a former deputy governor of the Chinese central
bank, is a special adviser to IMF Managing Director Dominique
Strauss-Kahn. Justin Lin is chief economist at the World Bank.
 Hu said China backed the IMF in its efforts to prevent the
""destructive"" impact of large capital movements, both inward and
outward, on individual economies.
 Wading into the debate on how to improve the global monetary
order, Hu called for ""an international reserve currency system
with stable value, rule-based issuance and manageable supply"".
 Central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan proposed in March 2009
that a strengthened version of the Special Drawing Right, the
IMF's in-house unit of account, could eventually dethrone the
dollar as the world's premier reserve currency.
 In a thinly veiled criticism of the United States, Hu urged
countries that issue reserve currencies to adopt responsible
policies and maintain relatively stable exchange rates.
 Chinese officials have pointedly voiced dissatisfaction with
the Federal Reserve's easy-money policy in the run-up to the
Seoul summit, fearing it will trigger destabilising flows of
footloose capital into emerging markets in search of yield.
 The United States in response has consistently urged China to
expand domestic demand so its economy relies less on exports.
 Hu said China would do just that and switch to a growth model
driven by consumption.

(Adds Germany agreeing on mechanism plan)
 By Jan Strupczewski and Padraic Halpin
 BRUSSELS/DUBLIN, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Ireland is in talks to
receive emergency funding from the European Union and is likely
to become the second euro zone country after Greece to obtain an
international rescue, official sources said on Friday.
 Irish borrowing costs have shot to record highs this week
because of concern about the country's ability to reduce a
public debt burden swollen by bank bailouts, and worries that
private bond holders could be forced to shoulder part of the
costs of any bailout by taking ""haircuts"" on their holdings.
 Government officials in Dublin have denied repeatedly that
they plan to tap EU funds, and an Irish finance ministry
spokesman said after the Reuters story was published that there
were ""no talks on an application for emergency funding from the
European Union.""
 Euro zone sources told Reuters that aid discussions were
under way, however. One official said it was ""very likely"" that
Ireland would get financial assistance from the EU facility set
up after Greece obtained a 110 billion euro bailout in May.
 ""Talks are ongoing and European Financial Stability Facility
(EFSF) money will be used; there will be no haircuts or
restructuring or anything of the kind,"" one euro zone source
said. A second source confirmed the talks.
 Under the EFSF, the 16 states in the euro zone can provide
up to 440 billion euros in emergency loans to crisis-hit
members. The EU's rescue mechanism also allows for the provision
of 60 billion euros from all 27 EU members and 250 billion euros
or more from the International Monetary Fund.
 The sources did not specify how large any bailout of Ireland
might be but analysts polled by Reuters on Thursday estimated it
could be around 48 billion euros ($66 billion), less than half
the sum pledged to Greece.
 Irish bond yields fell slightly after the Reuters report but
the euro barely moved. Analysts said market reaction was modest
because of uncertainty over whether Ireland would get a bailout,
and since an infusion of funds would not by itself solve the
country's long-term problems.
 ""It may put to rest some of the immediate concerns.
Longer-term, the question of whether Ireland in the end will
have to restructure some of its debt won't go away. Secondly,
the focus may shift to other potential bailout candidates, in
particular Portugal,"" said Sarah Hewin, senior economist at
Standard Chartered Bank.
 Philip Poole, global head of macroeconomic and investment
strategy at HSBC Global Asset Management, said a quick bailout
would be taken very positively by markets, but the experience of
the Greek bailout suggested that agreement on the conditions
attached to emergency loans could take a long time.

 SPREADS
 Pressure on Irish bonds eased earlier on Friday after
France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Britain, seeking to calm the
markets, issued a statement confirming that holders of existing
euro debt would not take a hit if the EU proceeded with plans to
introduce a mechanism letting countries restructure their debt.
 The spread between the Irish 10-year bond yield and the
German benchmark, which rocketed to a high of nearly 7
percentage points on Thursday, narrowed to around 5.8 percentage
points on Friday.
 But borrowing costs for Ireland remain sky-high and pressure
on Ireland's fragile banks may have forced the government to
enter aid discussions, even though it is fully funded until
mid-2011 and does not face the same liquidity crisis that
confronted Greece earlier this year.
 The EU, in turn, may be keen to calm investors with an Irish
bailout to prevent contagion to other indebted countries such as
Portugal and Spain.
 Going to the EU for aid would represent a humiliating
setback for Ireland, which posted some of the best growth rates
in the euro zone during the bloc's first decade of existence.
 The global financial crisis, weak regulation of the banking
sector and a property bubble fuelled by rock-bottom interest
rates eventually caught up with Ireland. This year its budget
deficit is projected to total 32 percent of gross domestic
product, by far the highest in Europe.
 Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of the group of euro zone
finance ministers, said on Friday that the EU was following the
situation in Ireland very closely but there was no immediate
reason to think Ireland would ask for aid.
 Earlier on Friday, Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen blamed
Germany for aggravating Ireland's woes by pushing the idea of
asset value reductions for private bondholders in a future
rescue mechanism that Berlin wants in place by 2013, when the
EFSF facility expires.
 ""It hasn't been helpful,"" Cowen said of Germany's plan,
speaking to the Irish Independent newspaper, ""The consequence
that the market has taken from it is to question the commitment
to the repayment of debt.""
 German government sources told Reuters late on Friday that
Berlin had largely agreed a plan for the mechanism. Under it,
holders of euro zone bonds would have to accept ""Collective
Action Clauses"" from 2013 that would allow a country to
reschedule its debts if it suffered a debt crisis.
 Such a rescheduling would involve investors holding bonds
for longer, or having to accept reduced interest payments, or a
""haircut"" -- or writedown, the sources said.
 Ministries in Berlin do not regard the plan as a final
concept, the sources said. Instead, German officials now want to
discuss the points that are important to Germany with the
European Commission.
 Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said on Friday that the
country did not need to ask for EU help because it was well
funded into June of next year.
 ""Why apply in those circumstances? It doesn't seem to me to
make any sense,"" he told RTE television. ""It would send a signal
to the markets that we are not in a position to manage our
affairs ourselves.""

progress in its relationship with China over currency and trade
issues, a senior Obama administration official said on Friday as
Group of 20 leaders met.
 ""When you look past some of the heat we've seen recently and
you look at what's happening in our very important relations with

 ""We've seen them move to let the exchange rate appreciate in

 The U.S. briefing offered a more conciliatory tone than
recent criticism of China's exchange rate policies from U.S.

 The official spoke after U.S. Treasury Secretary Geithner met
with Beijing's top economic officials, Chinese Vice Premier Wang
Qishan and the head of China's central bank, Zhou Xiaochuan.
 Geithner last month put off a decision on whether China is
manipulating its currency for trade advantage until sometime
after the G20 summit and a similar gathering in Yokohama, Japan,
this weekend.
 On Thursday, U.S. President Barack Obama also met with
Chinese President Hu Jintao on the sidelines of the G20 summit.
 On the broader trade agenda with China, the senior U.S.
official said China was ""beginning to take steps to address the
very important concerns that we have"" on intellectual property
protection and access to China's markets.
 ""We want to obviously build on that in preparation for
President Hu's visit,"" the official said, referring to a planned
trip to Washington early next year by the Chinese leader.

to proceed with high-level talks with the aim of launching trade

with Tokyo keen to catch up with Asian rival South Korea.
 The agreement was reached during a meeting between Prime
Minister Naoto Kan and European Council President Herman Van

the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in the Korean capital.
 Japanese firms are urging the government to forge more trade

 * Remains under pressure as long positions cleared
 * Ireland remains in spotlight, G20 not seen conclusive
 * Dollar's rise blocked at 82.50 yen area
 By Ian Chua and Chikafumi Hodo
 SYDNEY/TOKYO, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The euro hit six-week lows
on the dollar on Friday, threatening support at $1.3600 as
investors closed long positions and as renewed concerns about
Ireland's ability to pay its debt kept up selling pressure.
 The euro, which fell nearly 1 percent on Thursday, has shed
about 2.6 percent this week as long positions built up into the
Federal Reserve's bond buying decision last week have been
unwound heading into the year-end book-closing season.
 On the charts it has support at $1.3558 and then $1.3532, its
55-day moving average. Liquidity is thinning out and the market
has been whippy as investors have liquidated longs.
 Traders are watching G20 leaders meeting in Seoul as they
labour to tackle currency strains, but they were expected to
agree just indicative guidelines on global imbalances and leave
the details until next year, sources said.
 The single currency dipped as far as $1.3601, where its
bounce from that level prompted talk of options barriers, and the
dollar index, a measure of its performance against six
currencies, tested significant resistance at an October high.
 ""Sentiment for the euro turned even weaker after breaking
below $1.37,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager at Okasan
Securities' foreign securities section.
 ""In general, the market is keen to cover the dollar (short)
positions due to growing concerns over debt problems in Ireland
and other European countries.""
 The 10-year Irish government bond yield has rocketed to 9
percent, from as low as 4.4 percent earlier this year, making it
the second highest yielding euro zone bond after Greece's 11.7
percent. The bid/ask yield spread for Irish debt has also blown
out, suggesting the market is freezing up.
 Two thirds of economists and bond strategists polled by
Reuters on Thursday believe Ireland will seek international
rescue funds before the end of next year.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the European Union was
ready to deal with all scenarios in the Irish financial crisis.
 All this was likely to keep pressure on the single currency,
dealers said. It fell 0.3 percent on the day to $1.3621, 0.4
percent to 112.30 yen, and hit a record low against the
Australian dollar around $1.3640. Against the pound, it was down
at 7-week lows around 84.50 pence.
 The dollar, in a decline for weeks in anticipation of more
quantitative easing from the Fed, has benefited as months-old
short positions unwind.
 Against a basket of major currencies, the greenback has risen
3.5 percent from a near one-year low set last week and was last
at 78.27 after faltering at resistance around 78.36. If it can
take that level out, chartists note resistance from its 50-day
moving average currently at 78.70.
 The dollar bought 82.40 yen, little changed from
late New York levels. It has recovered from a 15-year low of
80.21 yen at the start of the month to 82.80 yen this week but
traders say sell orders from players such as Japanese exporters
are lined up between 82.50-83.00 yen.
 On the charts, the dollar's 55-day moving average comes in at
82.87 yen and chartists note it has not traded above that average
since June, when it peaked above that level for two sessions.
That is also its Sept. 15 pre-intervention low of 82.87 yen.
 The euro zone debt woes also curbed appetite for risk
assets, sending global equity markets lower and taking a toll on
commodity currencies.
 The Australian dollar slid below parity against
the greenback to trade at $0.9957. Stops were seen below $0.9950,
which could take the Aussie towards $0.9900 in the short term.
 ""It just feels a little tired and there is a little bit of
nervousness about a bit more of a substantial clean-out in
Aussie downside,"" said Grant Turley, strategist at ANZ.
 Some analysts say however the dollar is still likely to be
hampered by the fact that the Fed has committed to injecting more
stimulus into the economy, effectively keeping U.S. rates
low and making the dollar an attractive funding currency.

 HONG KONG, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The euro extended losses on
Friday on fears Ireland may need a bailout just like Greece,
while commodities eased as the U.S. dollar rose, hitting the
pause button on a rally that pushed copper to record highs.
 Traders slowed their selling of euros a bit after knocking
the currency down 4 cents in the past week, squaring up before
a statement about Ireland that may be issued by Britain and
France later in the day.
 Asian stock markets were mostly lower as traders took
profits on gains this week heading into the weekend.
 The possibility of a bailout for Ireland has significantly
widened the difference of bond yields of high-risk European
countries over those of Germany, and overshadowed a Group of 20
leaders' summit in Seoul, where a breakthrough on resolving
global economic imbalances amid incongruent policies looked
unattainable.

 The resurgence of fears about Europe's sovereign debt has
added to a shift back into dollars and out of riskier assets.
 The euro was down 0.3 percent against the U.S. dollar at
$1.3625 after tumbling 0.9 percent on Thursday.
 A close below the 200-week moving average of $1.3647 is a
grim omen for the euro and paves the way to the next obstacle

 The dollar has been rebounding ever since the Federal
Reserve unveiled its $600 billion plan to buy Treasuries last
week Wednesday. The dollar index, which measures the dollar's
performance against a basket of other major currencies, has
risen 3.2 percent since then to a 5-week high.
 Commodities traders had barely blinked at the dollar's
gains earlier in the week but prices succumbed to profit taking
on Friday.
 Analysts, however, were still looking for bullish moves in
metals markets next year.
 The rolling 30-day correlation between the U.S. dollar
index and the Reuters-Jefferies index of 19 commodities has
moved from -0.90 at the beginning of November to -0.22 on
Thursday.
 Three-month copper traded on the London Metal Exchange was
down 1 percent to $8,732 a tonne after hitting a record high of
$8,966 on Thursday.
 Some analysts though still think copper prices could trek
up to as high as $11,500 next year.
 U.S. crude futures fell 1 percent to $86.93 a barrel though
were still up 6.7 percent so far in November, having risen for
the past two months.
 Equities in Asia were mostly softer, with Hong Kong leading

 By Kevin Plumberg
 HONG KONG, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Friday on
fears Ireland may need a bailout just like Greece, while a
sharp decline in commodities and stock prices hastened a broad
retreat from risky assets.
 Major European stock markets opened lower, with the
FTSEurofirst 300 falling 0.7 percent and London's FTSE 100 down
1.2 percent. U.S. stock index futures dropped 1.2 percent.
 Asian stocks were broadly lower, led by a 5 percent drop in
the Shanghai composite index -- the biggest single-day decline
since May -- on lingering talk of interest rate increases and a
scramble out of resource-related shares. Plain old profit
taking was also the culprit.
 This year has been difficult for many investors because of
the sudden shifts in risk taking on everything from the
sovereign debt crisis in Europe, fears of both a slowdown and
overheating in China and U.S. double dipping back into
recession, causing havoc to trading strategies.
 As a result, many may be prone to take profits -- or losses
-- and wait for 2011.
 The possibility of a government bailout for Ireland has
significantly widened the difference of bond yields of
high-risk European countries over those of Germany, and
overshadowed a Group of 20 leaders' summit in Seoul, where mere

move lower was in the cards for metals.
 Three-month copper traded on the London Metal Exchange was
down 2.2 percent to $8,630.50 a tonne after hitting a record
high of $8,966 on Thursday.
 The corrective move lower could ultimately continue to
$8,553, the 50 percent retracement of the rise to $8,966 from
$8,140.
 U.S. crude futures fell 1.8 percent to $86.31 a barrel,
though were still up 5.9 percent so far in November, having
risen for the past two months.
 Equities in Asia were mostly softer, with mainland Chinese
markets chalking up the biggest declines, though strategists
were generally not concerned about the longer-term outlook.
 ""Dollar strong, Asia weak. I think there's much beyond
that,"" Markus Rosgen, Asia equity strategist with Citi in Hong
Kong, said.
 ""After this week, investors just don't want to hold a lot

 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan was
down 2.1 percent, with financials and telecom sectors under the

weekly drop since July, down 3.2 percent.
 It has had a strong inverse relationship with the dollar

 By Alex Richardson and David Ljunggren
 SEOUL, Nov 12 (Reuters) - G20 leaders closed ranks on
Friday and agreed to a watered-down commitment to watch out for
dangerous imbalances, yet offered investors little proof that
the world was any safer from economic catastrophe.
 After an acrimonious start, the developed and emerging
nations agreed at a summit in Seoul to set vague ""indicative
guidelines"" for measuring imbalances between their multi-speed
economies but, calling a timeout to let tempers cool, left the
details to be discussed in the first half of next year.
 European leaders broke away for their own mini gathering in
the middle of the summit to discuss a deepening credit crisis
in Ireland, a stark reminder that the consequences of the worst
financial crisis since the Great Depression still posed a
serious threat to global stability.
 In a communique signed off at the end of the gathering, the
group's fifth since the financial crisis exploded in 2008,
there was a little something for everyone.
 Leaders vowed to move towards market-determined exchange
rates, a reference to China's tightly managed yuan that the
United States has long complained is undervalued.
 They pledged to shun competitive devaluations, a line
addressing other countries' concern that the U.S. Federal
Reserve's easy-money policy was aimed at weakening the dollar.
 In a nod to emerging markets struggling to contain huge
capital inflows, the G20 gave the okay to impose ""carefully
designed"" control measures.
 They also agreed that there was a critical, but narrow,
window of opportunity to conclude the long-elusive Doha round
of trade liberalisation talks launched in 2001.
 But there was no mention of Ireland, and the bland promises
to deal with imbalances did not appear substantive enough to
bring about any real shift. The International Monetary Fund
warned that gaps between cash-rich exporters and debt-laden
importers was widening to pre-crisis levels.
 ""The work that we do here is not always going to seem
dramatic,"" U.S. President Barack Obama told a news conference
after the summit.
 ""It's not always going to be immediately world-changing.
But step by step what we're doing is building stronger
international mechanisms and institutions that will help
stabilise the economy, ensure economic growth and reduce some
tensions.""
 Global financial markets were not moved by the outcome of
the G20 summit as it offered few concrete measures to change
economic policy. Investors were instead focused on the fiscal
crisis in Ireland.
 BURYING THE HATCHET
 After weeks of verbal jousting, the United States and China
sought to bury the hatchet over rows about China's
""undervalued"" currency and the global risks created by the U.S.
printing money to reflate its struggling economy.
 ""Exchange rates must reflect economic realities ...
Emerging economies need to allow for currencies that are market
driven,"" Obama said. ""This is something that I raised with
President Hu (Jintao) of China and we will closely watch the
appreciation of China's currency.""
 The G20's accord sought to recapture the unity that was
forged in crisis two years ago, but deep divides meant the
leaders could not venture much beyond what was already agreed
by their finance ministers last month.
 Negotiators had laboured until the early hours of the
morning to thrash out an agreement their leaders could all
endorse, despite sharp disagreements that were on public
display in the days before the meeting.
 ""This hasn't been a love-fest,"" an official who
participated in the negotiations said.
 In particular, the leaders were unable to reach a consensus
on how to identify when global imbalances pose a threat to
economic stability, merely committing themselves to a
discussion of a range of indicators in the first half of 2011.
 Tim Condon, head of research at ING Financial Markets in
Singapore said it was ""hard to disagree"" with the vows of the
leaders but they had fallen short of the progress hoped for
going into the summit.
 ""They decided just to put down a lot of laudable objectives
as the conclusion of the meeting and hope that they can do
better, that more can be accomplished in future meetings,"" he
said.
 The G20 has fragmented since a synchronised global
recession gave way to a multi-speed recovery. Slow-growing
advanced economies have kept interest rates at record lows to
try to kickstart growth, while big emerging markets have come
roaring back so fast that many are worried about overheating.
 ""G20 credibility does depend on showing results ... we
cannot get out of this with beggar-thy-neighbour policies,""
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said. ""We need instead
to continue to coordinate our actions going forward. The
recovery is fragile.""
 ""I don't think the fact that we aren't there yet, we
haven't resolved all these problems, means we will fall back.""

285,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2010 05:52PM ET</span>",Q+A-What's next for the IMF Special Drawing Right?," By Lesley Wroughton
 WASHINGTON, Nov 11 (Reuters) - The International Monetary
Fund is expected to consider by the end of the month possible
changes to the basket of currencies that make up the IMF
Special Drawing Right, which has been mentioned as a potential
future global reserve currency.
 The basket was created by the IMF over 40 years ago to
serve as an international reserve asset. Its value is based on
a basket of ""freely usable"" currencies -- the dollar, the euro,
the British pound and Japanese yen. A review of the basket is
usually conducted every five years.
 Discontent with a weakening U.S. dollar has sparked
interest in finding alternatives to supplant the greenback's
dominant role in the global economy, putting a fresh focus on
SDRs.
 Below are some questions and answers about SDRs and the SDR
basket.
 WHAT IS THE SDR?
 The SDR was created by the IMF in 1969 to support the
Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system. Countries
participating in this system needed official reserves -- gold
and the U.S. dollar -- that could be used when needed to
purchase their local currency in foreign exchange markets, as
required to maintain its exchange rate.
 But the international supply of the two reserve assets was
not enough to support growing world trade and financial
developments. The international community decided to create the
SDR as a new international reserve asset under the auspices of
the IMF.
 It is not a currency. It can be held and used by member
countries, the IMF and certain designated official entities
called ""prescribed holders."" SDRs can be traded for one of the
""freely usable"" currencies through voluntary trading
arrangements among official SDR holders, and there is also a
backstop system to ensure the liquidity of the SDR for
countries with balance of payments needs.
 These official SDRs cannot be held, for example, by private
entities or individuals, but the private sector can denominate
bonds and deposits in SDRs. They serve as the unit of account
of the IMF and other global institutions, like the Bank for
International Settlement.
 WHY IS THE UPCOMING SDR REVIEW OF INTEREST?
 The meteoric rise of emerging market economies such as
China, India and Brazil has prompted increased debate over
whether the world needs a reformed monetary system, in which
currencies such as the Chinese yuan play a more prominent
role.
 China is now the world's second-largest economy, although
its currency is not convertible on the capital account and
therefore it is barely used outside China.
 In March 2009, Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan
suggested the dollar could give way as the premier reserve
currency to a beefed-up SDR.
 Russia too has called for the expansion of the SDR to
include its currency, the ruble, plus the yuan and gold.
 More recently, Brazil's Central Bank President Henrique
Meirelles on Thursday said he favored replacing the U.S. dollar
as the world's reserve currency with the SDR. [nN11285253]
 France, which takes over the rotating chair of the Group of
20 major economies next week, wants to make global monetary
reforms the focus of its presidency. A thorny issue, according
to French officials, is the diversification away from the
dominance of the dollar.
 The upcoming SDR review would be an opportunity to expand
or alter the composition of currencies that make up the SDR
basket.
 WHO DECIDES ON THE COMPOSITION OF THE SDR BASKET?
 The decision is in the hands of the IMF executive board,
which represents member countries. Any SDR decision needs the
support of 70 percent of the voting power in the 24-member
board.
 Under some principles that have guided past IMF reviews,
the composition of the SDR should be representative of the
currencies used internationally. It also should be stable, so
it it should not include too much of any one currency.
 In its review five years ago, the IMF concluded that the
SDR should be weighted at 44 percent U.S. dollar, 34 percent
euro, 11 percent yen and 11 percent pound. At the time, the
countries behind these currencies represented more than 50
percent of world exports.
 The deadline for a decision in the review is January 1;
however, the board could simply decide to defer its decision.
If the board meets later this month, as expected, it could
emerge with an immediate decision, as in past 5-yearly reviews,
or agree to a postponement.
 WHAT DOES THE IMF MEAN BY A 'FREELY USABLE' CURRENCY?
 The IMF's use of the phrase 'freely usable' currencies as
part of the SDR basket refers to those that are widely used in
international transactions and those that are widely traded on
foreign exchange markets.
 It does not mean freely floating. Nor does it mean freely
convertible, although in practice convertibility facilitates
international transactions and trading in foreign exchange
markets. It also has nothing to do with capital controls or an
exchange rate regime of a specific country.
 According to analysts, the yuan falls short of the ""freely
usable"" criterion. Some have suggested that the inclusion of
the Canadian dollar or the Korean won in the SDR would be a
good addition to the big four reserve currencies.
 WHAT HAPPENS IN THE SDR REVIEW PROCESS?
 At the time of a review, IMF staff present a report to the
executive board, providing analysis and options for possible
changes to the SDR, including proposals for re-weighting each
currency within the basket.
 Among issues considered in the review are exports of
countries and composition of international reserves. Also,
various indicators about the use of currencies such as
international bank liabilities, foreign exchange turnover and
global debt securities are also taken into account.
 HOW OFTEN IS THE SDR BASKET ALTERED?
 There have been relatively few changes in the SDR basket
since it was established. The basket was originally made up of
16 currencies. It was streamlined to five in 1980 to make it
more of a reserve asset, as the five currencies (dollar, yen,
pound, Deutsche mark and French franc) had deep foreign
exchange markets. The next change was in 2000 when the euro
replaced the Deutsche mark and French franc.
 An overhaul in the make-up of the SDR basket could be
forced by a decision by major economies to reform the
international financial system, as was the case with the
introduction of the euro in 1999.
 Some additional IMF principles, which aim to ensure a
measure of predictability in the make-up of the SDR, stipulate
that the composition of the basket should only change as a
result of ""significant developments"" from previous reviews.
They also say that any revisions of the criteria for selecting
the currencies in the SDR, and their weights in the basket,
should occur only when there are major changes in the roles of
currencies in the world economy.
 WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP?
 The IMF board meets at the end of November to decide
whether or not to change the composition of the SDR basket. It
is hard to predict what the likely outcome will be until there
is more clarity from politicians.
 If the IMF were to include the yuan, it would be an
acknowledgment of China's rising clout.
 Including the yuan in the SDR basket seems an obvious first
step and is something the Chinese are ready to discuss, a
French official told Reuters.
 A more-representative SDR would appeal to asset managers
and, in theory, could slowly transform it into a real currency.
For now, however, the dollar looks set to remain the dominant
reserve currency for some time to come.

 By Daniel Bases and Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Nov 11 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a five-week
low on Thursday on concerns about Ireland's ability to repay
its debt while earnings fears knocked U.S. stocks lower after a
technology bellwether Cisco Systems gave a dismal outlook.
 Gold prices rose on escalating concerns about debt in some
euro zone economies, overcoming a stronger U.S. dollar which
makes the metal more expensive to trade. Oil prices were
unchanged, with news of strong Chinese demand offset by the
rise of the greenback.
 Equities in Tokyo were poised on Friday to mirror weak U.S.
trade. The December futures contract for the Nikkei 225 stock
index <0#NK:> trading in Chicago fell 30 points to 9840.
 Yields on 10-year Irish bonds rose to a record high over
comparable German debt as investors speculated Ireland will
soon need financial help to service its debt. For details, see
[ID:nLDE6AA0MK].
 Ireland's Finance Minister Brian Lenihan admitted the surge
in borrowing costs had become ""very serious,"" but European
officials denied for a second day that Dublin was seeking
financial aid -- echoing the denials heard six months ago when
Greece needed an EU/IMF bailout.
 ""The market has gone back to focusing on Europe rather than
the U.S., where rates are currently very low,"" said Greg
Anderson, G10 FX strategist at Citigroup in New York. ""It has
become a game of 'Which currency do you dislike the most?' and
right now that currency is the euro.""
 The euro  fell as low as $1.3637, a five-week nadir,
and was last down 0.9 percent at $1.3655 . It also
posted losses against the yen  and hit a seven-week
low against sterling .
 The dollar strengthened against major currencies, with the
U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.64 percent. Also supporting the
greenback was a U.S. think tank report saying the Federal
Reserve may scale back its latest plan to buy government
bonds.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was up 0.3

 European stocks ended little changed, with investors uneasy
about the situation in Ireland. The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3>
index of top European shares lost 0.07 percent after falling
0.7 percent on Wednesday. The index is up 71 percent since a
record low in March 2009 but only 6 percent higher in 2010.

 Trade was volatile as the strength of the greenback took
off some of its shine.
 ""Gold is resuming its role as a safe haven in times of

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Nov 11 (Reuters) - The euro slid to a five-week
low against the dollar on Thursday as growing uncertainty about
Ireland's ability to repay its debts overshadowed attempts at a
Group of 20 summit to ease global tensions over currency and
trade policies.
 Ireland's issues have moved to the forefront of currency
concerns recently after taking a backseat to U.S. Federal
Reserve policy for several weeks. Yields on 10-year Irish bonds
rose well above 8 percent to a record high over comparable
German debt, the euro zone's standard.
 Investors are worried Ireland would not be able to cut
spending as planned and may require a bailout, with bond
holders forced to absorb losses.
 ""The market has gone back to focusing on Europe rather than
the U.S., where rates are currently very low,"" said Greg
Anderson, G10 FX strategist at Citigroup in New York. ""It has
become a game of 'Which currency do you dislike the most?' and
right now that currency is the euro.""
 The Fed's Treasury bond purchase program, announced last
week, is widely viewed as detrimental to the value of the
dollar and a boon for higher-yielding, riskier currencies. That
trade, however, may have run its course and Europe's debt
issues have caused investors to shun higher-risk assets in
favor of the greenback.
 The euro fell as low as $1.3637 on trading platform EBS, a
five-week trough, and was last down 0.9 percent at $1.3655. It
also fell 0.6 percent against the yen and hit a seven-week low
against sterling.
 ""While we think the euro looks vulnerable over the
near-term, by the end of the year it will likely head higher,""
Anderson said.
 BNP Paribas said the decline of the euro versus the dollar
may prove shallow, stalling near $1.3435-$1.3333 support during
the next few weeks.
 If pivotal $1.3333 pattern support holds, the euro's
underlying longer-term rally off its June low around $1.1875
will remain intact. As such, the euro would be capable of
rallying again and setting a new cycle high above $1.4280 later
this year or in early 2011, the bank said in commentary.
 INCREASED DOLLAR APPEAL
 The spike in Irish yields and decline in German yields as
investors seek shelter in bunds has come as U.S. yields have
turned higher, lifted partly by a string of strong U.S economic
data, including October's employment report.
 The yields make holding the dollar more attractive and
helped it rise above 82 yen this week for the first time since
early October. It was last up 0.3 percent at 82.51 yen.
 The Fed said it would buy $600 billion of Treasuries by
mid-2011 to lower U.S. interest rates and boost slow growth,
though a U.S. think tank report on Thursday said the central
bank could buy fewer bonds if the economy improves.
 Trading was lighter than usual, with some markets in the
United States and Canada closed for holidays. The U.S. bond
market was closed in observance of the Veterans Day holiday.
 G20 MEETS IN SOUTH KOREA
 Europe's woes diverted attention from a G20 summit in South
Korea. Discussion was expected to include exchange rate
policies and global economic imbalances, though few investors
expect a sweeping agreement.
 Much of the disagreement on currencies focuses on the
United States and China, with the former eager to see the
Chinese yuan appreciate at a faster pace.
 Citigroup's Anderson said the G20 is too big a group to
reach any substantive agreement at the meeting in Seoul.
 ""There are just too many diverse interests in play, so we
do not expect any major developments to come out of it,"" he
said.

(Adds background, byline)
 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service said
on Thursday it is awaiting the release of Ireland's four-year
fiscal plan later this month to decide whether to downgrade the
country's credit rating.
 ""We intend to conclude this review in the course of
December,"" a Moody's spokesman told Reuters.
 The ratings agency put Ireland's Aa2 ratings on review for
a possible downgrade on Oct. 5, citing the impact of additional
bank recapitalization needs, increased uncertainty regarding
the economic outlook, and elevated borrowing costs.
 Ireland's borrowing costs soared to all-time highs on
Thursday, further straining the debt-burdened government, as
investors worried about the country's ability to service its
obligations.
 A possible rating downgrade could send Ireland's debt
spreads even higher.
 Among the big-three rating agencies, Moody's currently
gives Ireland the highest credit rating, eight notches above
junk status. Standard & Poor's has the country seven degrees
above junk, at AA-minus, while Fitch has it one step below S&P,
at A-plus.
 Moody's is particularly concerned about Ireland's ability
to preserve the government's financial strength in a difficult
economic environment.
 The four-year financial plan will be key for the government
to preserve public finances and bring the deficit below 3
percent of gross domestic product by 2014, according to the
agency.

 * Dispute over price adjustment clause not yet resolved
 
 By Sabine Siebold
 BERLIN, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Export potential for the Airbus
A400M military transporter plane may be more than a third lower
than parent company EADS is planning, a report delivered to
Germany's parliament showed on Thursday.
 A study by auditors PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) concluded
the export potential of the A400M would be around 280 planes,
according to documents presented to parliament by the German
Defence Ministry obtained by Reuters.
 EADS rejected the number as far too low.
 ""We're sticking to our assessment of the market of between
400 and 500 planes no matter what a consultancy firm says,"" a
spokesman for EADS said.
 The report follows a deal earlier this month to secure a 3.5
billion euro bailout for the troubled aircraft, which has been
hit by delays and disputes between the company and the seven
buyer nations over how to finance the project.
 Some 1.5 billion euros of that sum is a loan from the buyer
nations to Airbus, whose repayment is coupled to demand for the
aircraft. If sales are disappointing, tax payers may end up
sitting on a hefty bill, the report showed.
 ""If the number of A400Ms exported falls short of
expectations, the federal government carries the risk of default
for the remainder of the (German part) of the loan,"" it said.
 The ministry documents showed that a dispute over a price
adjustment clause in the A400M contract had not been resolved.
 EADS had not been able to show that the current clause put
it at a disadvantage, it said. ""The deadline for proving this
has been extended till the end of December 2010,"" it added.
 Germany aims to take delivery of the A400M between November
2014 and 2020. A basic version of the plane should be available
from June 2012 and reach its standard form in December 2018.
 Planes delivered ahead of this date are due to be equipped
to the standard form by EADS at its own expense. But this did
not mean there would be any additional delay in A400M delivery,
a spokesman for the German defence ministry said.

 * Other possible targets: fiscal deficit, debt level
 * At G20, exchange rates main ""bone of contention"": Kudrin
 
 By Gleb Bryanski
 SEOUL, Nov 11 (Reuters) - The Group of 20 nations may agree
on steps to introduce macroeconomic policy targets at a summit
in Seoul on Friday, Russia's Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin
said.
 ""There will be a road map and within this road map work will
be done to prepare such proposals and define the timeframe,""
Kudrin told reporters. 
 ""Ministers and the International Monetary Fund will analyse
these quantitative targets, their role and how they can be
introduced,"" he said, adding that the results of this work will
be reviewed at the next G20 summit.
 Kudrin said there was a ""big chance"" the roadmap will backed
by the G20 in Seoul and that the proposals will help global
exchange rates to become more flexible in the future.
 Kudrin said U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's
proposal to target current account surpluses and deficits was
""interesting"" but that other targets would also be needed.
 ""Other quantitative targets include fiscal deficit, debt
level, parameters close to Maastricht criteria,"" Kudrin said,
referring to the limits set by the European Union for countries
to qualify to adopt the euro.
 Kudrin's remarks did not fall in line with other G20
members, including Germany and China, who have criticised the
U.S. for pursuing quantitative easing -- effectively printing
money, a policy that has weighed on the dollar and encouraged
investors to divert funds into emerging markets in search of
higher yields.
Instead, Kudrin praised the U.S. Federal Reserve's crisis
measures, saying earlier in an interview with the television
channel Russia Today that ""at the first stage of the crisis the
Federal Reserve accepted a significant burden and its role then
was decisive.""
 He called on the Federal Reserve, however, to show more
caution this time around.
 Kudrin said that while there was no open confrontation at
the G20 talks, global exchange rates remain the main bone of
contention.
 He also said Russia will not introduce restrictions on
capital movements to protect its economy from volatile inflows
as there are no current threats of this happening.

(Combines stories, adds analyst, markets)
 By Krisztina Than and Gergely Szakacs
 BUDAPEST, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank warned
on Thursday that the government's 2011 budget could pose
long-term risks as it contains no plans to cut spending or
reform central Europe's most heavily indebted economy.
 The central bank's warning came after similar criticisms of
the centre-right government's economic plans from the
International Monetary Fund and Hungary's independent budget
council. Financial analysts have also expressed misgivings.
 The Fidesz government has rejected austerity plans and wants
to plug its budget deficit with windfall taxes on certain
sectors and transfers from private pension funds.
 It also hopes income tax cuts will boost growth to 5 percent
by 2013 and help reduce the country's debt from next year.
 Markets have so far received Fidesz' commitment to cut the
budget deficit to below 3 percent of GDP next year positively,
but long-term risks and extra taxes on banks, telecoms, retail
and energy firms have spooked investors.
 These concerns strengthened in the wake of an unexpected
announcement from the government on Wednesday that it planned to
keep an extra tax on banks and companies in place beyond the end
of 2012, when these taxes were slated to expire.
 This plan erodes predictability and investor sentiment,
analysts said.
 Following an almost 5 percent plunge in Budapest stocks on
Wednesday, the forint fell 0.8 percent to 276.45 versus the euro
on Thursday and bond yields rose 10-15 basis points as euro zone
debt concerns added to local risks.
 The central bank -- repeatedly attacked by the government in
the past for not cutting rates fast enough -- said the 2010 and
2011 budget targets were achievable but risks mounted down the
line due to the bad structure of the budget which lacked
spending cuts and reforms.
 ""The budget submitted does not contain deep structural
reforms, it preserves an inefficient spending structure and high
budget redistribution,"" central bank Governor Andras Simor told
a news conference.
 ""The planned measures worsen long-term fiscal
sustainability, and despite the significant personal income tax
cut, the long-term growth prospects do not improve
substantially, and the planned measures increase inflation
risks,"" he added.
 Simor said Hungary's 2011 budget bill effectively contains
fiscal stimulus worth 2 percent of GDP, which will be financed
by an expected transfer of pension savings to the state.
 The bank said the government's measures would boost
inflation in 2011 and the bank remained committed to meeting its
3 percent inflation goal ""with every tool available.""
 
 RECORD LOW
 The bank has kept its main lending rate at a record low of
5.25 percent for the past six months and will next meet on Nov.
29 when it will issue its fresh inflation and growth forecasts
in a quarterly inflation report.
 Simor said the bank would decide on rates on the basis of
its projections -- adding that while the 2011 budget poses
inflation risks, its report would assume stronger exchange rates
and lower oil prices than a previous report in August.
 Wage trends have been more benign than expected, he added.
 ""We think the MPC will continue the wait-and-see approach
this year, while now we see a bigger chance for a 25bp rate hike
in Q1 next year, although until domestic demand remains poor and
the employment rate doesn't start to increase substantially the
NBH is not in a hurry to hike,"" said David Nemeth at ING.
 ""It is quite unlikely that we will see an evident figure for
that (rise in employment) before the beginning of next year.""
 The centre-right government seems determined to use extra
company taxes to offset income tax cuts and big tax breaks for
families also beyond 2012.
 Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Thursday that Hungary
must create a new long-term system of taxes for banks and
companies in 2012 to replace the crisis taxes that were
necessary to solve short-term fiscal problems.
 The government on Wednesday confirmed that it plans to keep
its recently introduced windfall taxes on certain sectors of the
economy in place to a reduced extent until 2014.
 Orban said Hungary would negotiate in 2012 with banks,
retail, telecom and energy firms about the new taxes, but would
not return to the status quo seen before the crisis.
 Some analysts said that in the current negative sentiment
due to Irish and Portuguese debt woes, Hungary's long-term
fiscal sustainability risks could come more in the spotlight.
 ""The HUF is responding to the double whammy of internal
shock from policy announcements yesterday causing significant
equity selling on one hand -- and a rapid catch up on periphery
stress too,"" said Peter Attard Montalto at Nomura.
 ""All going to prove that Hungary's recent market stability
has rested on very thin ice indeed.""

 (Adds detail, updates prices, adds comment)
 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Doubt about Ireland's ability
to repay its debts spread on Thursday, driving the euro lower
and overshadowing G20 attempts to ease currency tensions and
secure commitment to more balanced global growth.
 Yields on 10-year Irish bonds rose well above 8 percent to
a record high over comparable German debt. Investors worried
the country wouldn't be able to cut spending as planned and may
require a bailout, with bond holders forced to absorb losses.
 The euro fell as low as $1.3642, a five-week trough, and
was last down 1 percent at $1.3656. It also fell against the
yen and hit a seven-week low against sterling.
 ""The euro can't sustain even modest upticks right now,""
said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown
Brothers Harriman, adding that its break of $1.3650 ""could open
up another two-cent decline.""
 He added, ""Europe never fully addressed these problems, and
it's clear solvency issues in Ireland have not been resolved.""
 Some traders said solvency fears were spreading, with a
rise in Spanish bond yields increasing market anxiety.
 ""If Spain is coming under the microscope, we could have a
larger breakdown in the euro given the size of the Spanish
economy,"" said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at Forex.com in
Bedminster, New Jersey.
 Dolan said $1.3520 may emerge as the next target, while
other traders said demand for downside options, particularly
one-month $1.3200 strikes, would keep pressure on the euro.
 INCREASED DOLLAR APPEAL
 The spike in Irish yields and decline in German ones as
investors seek shelter in bunds has happened as U.S. yields
have turned higher, lifted partly by a string of strong U.S.
economic data, including last month's employment report.
 That makes holding the dollar more attractive and also
helped it rise above 82 yen this week for the first time since
early October. It was last up 0.2 percent at 82.52 yen.
 There was still uncertainty about the dollar's medium-term
outlook, especially after the Federal Reserve said it would buy
some $105 billion in Treasuries over the next 30 days.
 The Fed said it would buy $600 billion of Treasuries by
mid-2011 to lower U.S. interest rates and boost slow growth,
though a U.S. think tank report on Thursday the central bank
could buy fewer bonds if the economy improves.
 Trading was lighter than usual, with some markets in the
United States and Canada closed for holidays.
 G20 MEETS IN SOUTH KOREA
 Europe's woes diverted attention from a G20 summit in South
Korea. Discussion was expected to include exchange rate
policies and global economic imbalances, though few investors
expect a sweeping agreement.
 Much of the disagreement on currencies lies with the
United States and China, with the former eager to see the
Chinese yuan appreciate at a faster pace.
 A senior Chinese central bank official said China had no
intention to confront the U.S. over its currency rate, and that
the issue should not be politicized.
 China has criticized the Fed's policy, saying it is stoking
inflation beyond U.S. borders, and former Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan said Wednesday the U.S. central bank was pursuing a
weaker dollar policy, prompting a swift denial from Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner.

 NEW YORK, Nov 11 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Thursday on
concerns about Ireland's ability to repay its debt while U.S.

 * Strategists say too many global uncertainties for gains
 * Eyes on U.S. recovery, dollar level, euro zone periphery
 
 By Michael Winfrey
 PRAGUE, Nov 11 (Reuters) - The wall of money expected to
follow the Fed's second round of quantitative easing has skipped
over emerging Europe, but economies with strong growth and
fiscal positions will eventually benefit.
 Despite expectations that a move by the U.S. Fed to buy $600
billion in government bonds for six months would extend a
liquidity-fuelled rally in the European Union's emerging east,
the Czech, Polish, and Hungarian currencies have barely budged.
 Part of that is due to much weaker growth prospects than
countries competing for the same flows across the world in
Latin America and Asia, where investors see currencies jumping
by 5 percent or more against the dollar this year.
 Another reason is low interest rates. Poland's 3.5 percent
and the Czech Republic's 0.75 percent are far below Brazil's
10.75 percent, and the cost of borrowing in India, Turkey and
South Africa is at 6 percent or more.
 Strategists said renewed worries of a euro zone debt crisis,
and positive U.S. jobs data that has pushed the dollar higher,
has also braked a months-long portfolio-fuelled rally that
helped push the forint and zloty 2 percent higher since August.
 ""QE2 was going to be a wall of money, a one way trade. But
now we've got QE2, there's a few more things out there where
people don't know which way they are going to turn, so people
are just holding back a bit,"" said RBS strategist Tim Ash.
 One advantage -- that the EU's emerging members foreswore
capital controls to enter the bloc -- sets them apart from their
emerging Asian and Latin American counterparts who are now
trying to staunch an inflow of QE-fuelled funds which has pushed
up their countries and damage their terms of trade.
 But that advantage has done little to lure the latest wave
of money. Since the Fed's Nov. 3 decision, the crown has eased
0.66 percent and the Hungarian forint 1.07 percent. The Polish
zloty is up 0.53 percent and the Romanian leu 0.4 percent.
 
 TOP PICK: POLAND 
 Country specifics are also in play, so even though the
region is lagging other emerging markets, countries with lower
debt levels and solid growth outlooks will outperform others.
 In Poland, expected to grow 3.5 percent or more this year,
policymakers are expected to hike rates from their all time low
of 3.5 percent over concerns of rising inflation pressure. 
 That will certainly attract new funds from investors seeking
yield in countries with solid economic and fiscal fundamentals,
building on liquidity-fuelled momentum that has largely favoured
it and Turkey by drawing funds fuelled by cheap western money.
 The Czechs, which many analysts now call a ""little Germany"",
are seen an even safer bet, but with official rates at 0.75
percent, the crown carries only the promise of gradual
appreciation based on economic fundamentals.
 One of the most difficult puzzles is Hungary, whose new
government has shocked markets with crisis taxes on mainly
foreign companies and a plan to raid citizens' contributions to
private pension accounts that analysts say will stifle growth
and hurt Hungary's democratic and business climate credibility.
 But the measures will allow Budapest to cut its 2011 budget
deficit to below the EU-prescribed level of 3 percent of annual
output. With a debt load just above the EU average, a primary
budget surplus of more than 1 percent and interest rates of 5.25
percent, many investors are willing to take a short-term risk.
 ""You've got to be schizophrenic about Hungary,"" said
Barclay's Capital strategist Koon Chow. ""The very short term
attitude is, it is underowned, underpositioned, and by raiding
the pension funds and hitting corporates with new taxes, they
have the power to amass significant liquidity reserves.""
 Investors are keeping a close eye on ratings agency Moody's,
which is expected to finish a review of its outlook on Hungary
this month and has threatened to downgrade it if the government
does not produce a credible fiscal policy.
 
 LEVELS APPROACHING
 The crown has outperformed its peers in 2010. It is up 6.9
percent on the year. The zloty is close behind at 5.7 percent.
The forint and Romania's leu have fallen about 2.25 percent and
1 percent, giving at least the former room for upside.
 The Polish zloty and Czech crown are expected to firm 2 to 4
percent to the euro in 12 months, according to a Reuters poll.
Hungary's forint is seen flat. [ID:nSLA3ME6HE]
 ""Poland is still our top pick, but we think the forint is a
close second. The Czechs, because of low interest rates, would
be in a third position,"" said RBC strategist Nigel Rendell.
 The zloty has traded near a six-month high this week, twice
breaking through the 3.890 resistance level that formed a
double-bottom hit over the past month. 
 The forint looks set to weaken in the near term and test 278
per euro, a strong support that held as resistance for most of
the summer until the forint broke through in mid-September.
 But without clarity on the global issues -- such as the euro
zone debt troubles and the state of U.S. recovery -- QE2 will
not trigger a new flood of funds into a region with lower growth
prospects and policy rates than in Asia and Latin America.
 ""Everyone had this great hope that QE would solve all these
problems,"" Rendell said. ""But now it's come and everyone is a
bit nonplussed ... On the other hand, if the Fed hadn't done QE,
then we'd all be in some kind of depressed state, I'm sure.""

 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Nov 11 (Reuters) - European Union governments have
approved a raft of trade concessions for Pakistan, diplomats
said on Thursday, a move to help the country rebound from July
floods which caused nearly $10 billion of damage.
 The final package is less extensive than the EU had hoped to
agree but still covers 75 Pakistani exports -- from cotton
sheets to clothing and ethanol -- which will be allowed to enter
the EU duty-free from 2011, an EU spokesman said.
 The duty waiver now needs approval from the World Trade
Organization and the European Parliament.
 Following pressure from EU industries that feared losing
market share to cheaper Pakistani imports, the tariff
suspensions will now apply for two years, with a third year only
granted after an assessment, EU diplomats said.
 The compromise also sets a duty-free quota on the most
sensitive products on the list: some fabrics, towels, women's
jeans and socks will lose their duty-free status if exports to
Europe rise by more than 20 percent per year, diplomats say.
 All remaining items may also lose their tariff suspension if
there is a surge in their exports to Europe, under a safeguard
mechanism whose method is yet to be agreed, diplomats said.
 Finally, the compromise has cut the duty-free allowance of
ethanol imports from Pakistan to 80,000 tonnes, from an
originally proposed 100,000 tonnes, diplomats said.
 ""These adjustments are not expected to lower considerably
the expected benefits for Pakistan's flood-stricken economy,""
said John Clancy, trade spokesman for the EU's executive
Commission, which drafted the original plans.
 
 REACTIONS TO THE COMPROMISE
 But some EU diplomats warned that Europe's concern for its
own industries could undermine the credibility of its stated aim
of using trade as a security and development tool.
 ""Some member states believe Europe has watered down its aid
to Pakistan too much. This creates a credibility problem --
after all this was supposed to be the method by which the EU
helps Pakistan reconstruct,"" said one EU diplomat.
 Another involved in the negotiations said: ""It's not ideal,
but at least we have a deal that we can put to the WTO.""
 The original plan unveiled in October said duty suspensions
would affect about 900 million euros worth of Pakistani exports
to the EU and estimated Pakistan could boost sales to the EU by
100 million euros.
 Most of the trade concessions will be on textile products,
though there are no tariff cuts for bed linen, Pakistan's main
export product, because of EU industry opposition.
 Britain, Germany and Sweden have led calls for trade the
concessions but countries with large textile and clothing
industries such as Italy, Spain and France were reluctant.
 The EU is drafting separate plans that could allow Pakistan
access to long-term trade discounts from 2014 under the
so-called GSP Plus regime, though that also faces opposition.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Nov 11 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Thursday,
closing in on a five-week low hit the previous day as concerns
about debt woes in the euro zone periphery triggered further
selling and a potential retest of key technical support.
 The yield spread between 10-year Irish and German government
bonds shot out to its widest ever as investors remain
unconvinced that Dublin will be able to carry out drastic
austerity measures to ensure it can repay its debts.
 ""There are mounting tensions in the euro zone, with
Portugal's bond auction yesterday showing yields are on a strong
rise,"" said Lutz Karpowitz, currency analyst at Commerzbank.
 ""This, together with problems in Ireland, is putting
pressure on the euro and I would expect further downward
movement from here,"" he said.
 The euro fell 0.5 percent to around $1.3700, approaching a
five-week low of $1.3670 hit on Wednesday.
 Its sell-off stopped just above $1.3690, a low hit in late
October and a level which technical analysts say the euro must
close under to make a further significant move lower.
 Traders said demand for downside options was increasing,
particularly one-month $1.3200 strikes, indicating growing
speculation the pair will fall around that level soon.
 The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a
basket of currencies, rose 0.4 percent to 77.919.
 The dollar was flat at 82.20 yen. On Wednesday, it rose to
around 82.80 yen, just shy of 82.87 yen, the level the U.S.
currency fell to in mid-September before Japan entered the
market to sell the yen.
 Some in the market said a break above that level may open
the door to more dollar gains, while traders said option
barriers at 83.00 would cap the U.S. currency's upside.
 The Veterans' Day holiday in the United States, where some
markets will be shut, was helping keep the market subdued.

 IRISH CDS CLIMBS
 Pressuring the euro lower was a jump in the cost of insuring
Irish debt against default, which hit a record high 625 basis
points as Dublin battles to prove it does not need a Greek-style
rescue to help it reduce the worst budget deficit in Europe.
 Comments from the European Commission that Ireland has not
requested any assistance from Europe did little to placate
investors, who dumped 10-year Irish government debt, expanding
the yield spread versus German ones to their widest ever.
 Weariness about other vulnerable euro zone countries,
including Portugal and Spain, also sent their CDS prices to
record highs, which analysts said was impacting the euro.
 ""The euro faces a serious threat in the form of a spiralling
peripheral debt situation. It's only the negativity surrounding
the dollar that's saving euro/dollar from a sharper correction
lower,"" said Tom Levinson, currency analyst at ING.
 In Seoul, Group of 20 leaders gathered to discuss currencies
and global economic imbalances, but agreement on those issues is
unlikely and few investors expect the statement will expand on a
finance ministers' agreement last month.
 Much of the disagreement on currencies lies between the
United States and China, with Washington eager to see Beijing's
currency appreciated at a faster pace.
 A senior Chinese central bank official said China had no
intention to confront the U.S. over its currency rate, and that
the issue should not be politicised.
 The official also said the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision
last week to implement more quantitative easing had raised
""strong concern"" among many countries.

316,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 11, 2010 07:18AM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD hits daily low amid ongoing euro zone concerns,
317,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2010 07:12AM ET</span>",RPT-SPECIAL REPORT-Gas in the Holy Land," But Amit Mor, a top Israeli energy expert who often consults
for the World Bank, said Israel was unlikely to go the same way
as the Netherlands. The difference, he said, is that in the
Netherlands and other countries that have suffered from Dutch
disease, the new revenue accounted for 20 to 30 percent of Gross
Domestic Product, sometimes even more. Revenue from Israel's gas
finds is likely to rise to no more than two percent of GDP by
2020, he said. ""The contribution of gas sales to the economy,
although important, is not going to be as significant as the
high-tech or other export sectors of Israel,"" Mor said. 
 And even if gas ends up contributing a higher proportion of
Israel's GDP - the ""best case"" scenario would be up to 10
percent, according to a source familiar with official
deliberations who wished to remain anonymous due to the
sensitivity of the issue - meltdown in other parts of the
economy is avoidable. Norway found oil in the North Sea shortly
after the Netherlands struck gas, but has been much smarter
about protecting its economy. At first it limited the amount of
oil produced. Later, it created a government fund to manage and
invest the country's petroleum wealth. The fund's assets are
currently valued at about $500 billion. 
 Other countries, like Chile and Azerbaijan, have copied
Norway's example, leading to speculation that Israel may set up
its own sovereign wealth fund. The source familiar with official
thinking told Reuters that the fund option had been talked about
but would not be adopted in the immediate future. ""The Norwegian
fund was created because of the great impact they knew it would
have on the economy. It was meant to deal with a problem that
was much more threatening in scope than we expect here,"" the
source said.
 CHANGING THE RULES 
 There's still a lot to do. The Israeli government has yet to
decide how much it will tax the companies that will produce the
gas. The country's law on royalties dates to 1952: written to
encourage exploration, it set the royalty level on gas and oil
income at 12.5 percent. That's one of the lowest rates in the
world. While company taxes lift Israel's total take from
commodities companies to about 32 percent, many in Israel want
the royalty rate increased. 
 In April, the Finance Ministry formed a committee led by
economist Eytan Sheshinski, an expert in public finance, to
study how much the government take should be. The committee is
set to deliver an interim report on Nov. 15.
 Unwilling to wait for the Sheshinski committee's views, a
group of government and opposition legislators have drafted a
bill to raise the gas and oil royalty level to 20 percent. ""In
the past decade, the average government take in countries (with
similar fiscal policies) increased from 49 to 53 percent, while
in Israel it went down from 39 to 32 percent due to a decrease
in company tax,"" a report by the parliamentarians said,
signalling room for a hike. 
 Along with an increase in royalties, or perhaps in its
place, one option under discussion is a progressive corporate
tax that increases with revenues generated. Any final decision
will have to pass a parliamentary vote.
 Predictably, energy companies are furious and argue that any
new tax would violate existing agreements. ""I am very worried,
both by the process and its essence,"" Delek Energy Chief
Executive Gideon Tadmor told Reuters. ""We came and invested on
the basis of a commitment, and agreement with the government
along a specific fiscal regime. To come retrospectively after
the discoveries were made and the drilling succeeded, is not
moral, is illegal, and not wise.""
 The Noble-Delek consortium says its total investment could
reach $3 billion, not including the Leviathan field. Tadmor said
that sort of investment could disappear if Israel changes its
current terms. Its waters are tough to explore, he said, due to
the lack of infrastructure, an Arab boycott scaring away many
foreign energy partners and the lack of government
participation.
 ""You need to think 10 steps ahead,"" Tadmor said. ""You need
to think of further discoveries and of safeguarding the
incentives so companies come drill.""
 An industry insider who would not be named because of the
sensitivies of the issue said politicians were acting like
""Robin Hood"" by trying to shower the public with wealth at the
companies' expense. It could backfire, he said, because an
increase to even 20 percent in royalties is ""tremendous"". Fields
with big reserves, like Tamar, could tolerate the increase, but
not smaller ones. Eventually there would be less drilling, less
revenue and less wealth, he said.
 Speaking for Noble at an Israeli parliamentary committee on
Oct. 5, former U.S. judge Abraham Sofaer said the dispute could
even be brought before the International Court of Justice. ""The
U.S. government will have to decide whether to act on behalf of
Noble in order to receive full compensation for the damages
caused to it,"" a committee spokesman quoted Sofaer as saying. ""I
don't need to tell you what a tragedy it will be if two allies
like the U.S. and Israel will have to resolve disagreements in a
European court."" 
 Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz dismissed the idea last
month, pointing out that countless countries have changed
government policies on royalties in the past. Just three years
ago, the Canadian province of Alberta hiked its royalty rate.
The year before that, Alaska pushed up taxes on oil companies
and China adopted a windfall tax on oil. 
 ""No court in Israel or in the world will say to the
government of Israel that it can't do what was done in the
United States or in Great Britain,"" he said. 
 In a letter to Steinitz seen by Reuters, Marc Sievers,
charge d'affaires at the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv, said the
possibility that the Sheshinski committee will recommend a
retroactive change ""undermines confidence in the stability of
Israeli fiscal policy and creates barriers to international
investment.
 ""I urge you to take these concerns into account and, at the
very least, to limit - publicly and in writing - application of
the committee's recommendation to future leases and licenses,""
Sievers wrote. A spokesman for the embassy would not comment on
the letter, which did not mention any steps the United States
might take.
 Still, raising taxes on resource companies is popular with
the Israeli public, and many lawmakers say they will not be
swayed. One sponsor of the bill, Shelly Yacimovich, in an open
letter to the media accused Delek owner Tshuva, Delek Energy
Chief Executive Tadmor and lobbyists of blocking a similar law
from being passed in 2001 and ""aggressively and continuously""
torpedoing efforts ever since.
 At a forum in Tel Aviv last month, veteran geologist Yossi
Langotsky, considered the father of Israeli gas exploration -
the Tamar site is named after his granddaughter - declared that
Israel needed to benefit more from the discoveries. Big
companies had backed out of projects in the past, he said,
pointing to UK -based BG Group's  2005 withdrawal from the
region. Others would still come and operate in Israel, he
assured the crowd."

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Nov 11 (Reuters) - European stocks edged lower on
Thursday, with Wall Street also set for modest losses, while the
dollar firmed and copper prices pushed to a record high.
 The moves reflected three drivers of financial markets --
evidence of strong Chinese growth, pressures on euro zone
peripheral debt and G20 currency squabbles.

fostered as countries struggled to contain the financial crisis
and global recession.

 Euro zone troubles are haunting markets again because Irish
debt is under intense pressure despite a huge bank
recapitalisation programme.
 The cost of insuring Spanish, Portuguese and Irish debt
against default hit record highs.
 The euro was 0.2 percent lower against the dollar at $1.3749
 partly as a result.

at a 4-1/2 month high.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> was up
0.2 percent.
 China, meanwhile, was driving some commodities higher after
reports that China's industrial production grew 13.1 percent in
October from a year earlier.
 London copper rose more than 2 percent on Thursday to a
record high and crude oil scaled a 25-month high.

319,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2010 06:36AM ET</span>",ECB's Kranjec says banking tax should be considered," LJUBLJANA, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Taxes on bank transactions and
levies on balance sheet liabilities could help improve financial
stability, ECB Governing Council member Marko Kranjec said in an
article published on Thursday.
 Kranjec, who is also a governor of the Slovenian central
bank, wrote in the monthly magazine Bancni Vestnik that while
""broad international consensus"" would be needed for a
transaction tax, this would make speculation less profitable and
liability levies would prevent excessive leverage.
 Slovenia is considering introducing selective bank taxes to
spur lending as the European Union and wider international
community consider financial transaction taxes.
 Kranjec said the taxes could provide better control
incentives in financial institutions where intense competition
for market share and profits could ""create perverse incentives
for risk taking which is well beyond prudent behaviour"".
 ""The appropriate governance of financial intermediaries is
therefore of primary importance.""
 One way to deal with the issue would be to make top bankers
and management ""responsible for the protection of the balance
sheet (of their bank) as a whole"".
 Another way would be to follow U.S. plans -- known as the
Volcker rule -- and split banks' traditional commercial banking
parts from more risky investment banking operations.
 He said the higher risk areas would enjoy no public
bail-outs and it would be up to shareholders to keep them in
check.
 However, ""narrow banking or limited purpose banking would
probably not prevent future financial crises and systemic
instability"", Kranjec said.
 Making bank employees responsible for the balance sheet as a
whole would therefore be a better approach, he said.

(Recasts with new quotes)
 By Keith Weir
 SEOUL, Nov 11 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister David
Cameron said on Thursday that long-running efforts to achieve a
global trade deal must be successfully concluded next year to
give the world economy a shot in the arm.
 Britain argues that completion of the so-called Doha round
could boost the global economy by as much as $170 billion and is
vital when interest rates are at record lows and many Western
countries are curbing government spending.
 ""It's got to be something we achieve next year. It's an
international embarrassment that we haven't completed this trade
round,"" he told a business summit on the sidelines of the G20.
 ""We need to make this deal bigger in order to make this deal
better in order to push it through faster,"" he added.
 The talks were launched in late 2001 but have been deadlocked
for two years, largely because of differences between the United
States and big emerging economies such as India, China and
Brazil.
 Commentators say a deal needs to be wrapped up before
attention in the United States turns towards the 2012
presidential election.
 Cameron, who took office in May after ousting Gordon Brown
from power, said that the G20 must avoid a return to the
protectionism of the 1930s as the consensus fostered by the 2008
credit crisis frays. Brown played a prominent role in the G2O's
response to the crisis.
 Cameron said the G20 was not in what he called a ""heroic
phase"", but argued that it was not losing relevance.
 ""One of the main purposes of this G20 should be to show we're
going to fight protectionism in all its forms,"" he said.
 ""We're going to fight trade barriers, we're going to fight
beggar-my-neighbour policies. We're going to fight (against)
currency wars. We're going to fight competitive devaluations.""
 Britain is backing efforts to create a free trade area for
Africa as a whole, Cameron citing the example of South Korea
which has transformed its economy over the past four decades
through heavy trading in goods.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Nov 11 (Reuters) - The euro dipped on Thursday after
skidding to a five-week low the previous day, with tensions in
the euro zone periphery expected to trigger further selling and
a potential retest of key technical support.
 The dollar lost steam after four days of gains but remained
close to significant barriers which, if broken, could see its
short-covering rebound stretch higher against the likes of the
yen and euro.
 ""There are mounting tensions in the euro zone, with
Portugal's bond auction yesterday showing yields are on a strong
rise,"" said Lutz Karpowitz, currency analyst at Commerzbank.
 ""This, together with problems in Ireland, is putting
pressure on the euro and I would expect further downward
movement from here,"" he said.
 Ireland is battling to prove it does not need a Greek-style
rescue to help it reduce the worst budget deficit in Europe. The
Irish central bank governor said on Wednesday a huge bank
recapitalisation programme had failed to reassure investors.
 Portugal's final debt issue this year drew solid demand on
Wednesday but at a high price as the euro zone peripheral states
remained under pressure. The euro traded at $1.3734 versus
the dollar, down 0.4 percent, holding above a five-week low of
$1.3670 hit on Wednesday. 
 Traders said a Dutch name was a notable seller in early
European dealing, with a major Asian sovereign account also keen
to sell euros, but Middle East demand was underpinning the
single currency.
 Technical analysts said a daily close below the October low
at $1.3690 would be needed for the euro to make a further
significant move lower.
 
 G20 WRANGLING
 In Seoul, Group of 20 leaders gathered to discuss currencies
and global economic imbalances. But negotiators wrangled over
the wording of a communique expected on Friday, and the
statement was not expected to venture much beyond a finance
ministers' agreement last month.
 ""The U.S. no longer appears to have the clout to push
through its agenda. The G20 is unlikely to adopt targets on
current account imbalances,"" said Etsuko Yamashita, chief
economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.
 Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said in
the Financial Times that the United States was pursuing a policy
of weakening the dollar but Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner
shot back, telling CNBC Washington would ""never do that"".
 The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a
basket of currencies, was up 0.1 percent at 77.74.
 After rising almost to its September pre-intervention low of
82.87 yen on Wednesday, the dollar was holding above 82.00 yen.
Even if 82.87 were to break, traders said option barriers at
83.00 would hamper further dollar gains.
 UBS analysts said in a note that long-yen speculative
positioning remained high, increasing the risk of position
unwinding into the year end, while a rise in U.S.-Japan bond
yield differentials could also help.
 The Veteran's Day holiday in the United States, where some
markets will be shut, was helping keep the market subdued.
The Australian dollar traded at $1.0015 after briefly dipping
below parity earlier in the session as data showed Australia's
jobless rate jumped -- a trend that could lessen the need for
higher interest rates.

 * Talks not heading towards any numerical targets
 * Communique language ""reasonable"", no instant solution
 By Krittivas Mukherjee
 SEOUL, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Group of 20 nations should not be
too demanding in respect to policy coordination because that it
has never been tried before, but eventually ""some agreement""
should be possible, India's chief G20 negotiator said on
Thursday.
 Efforts by several nations to hold down their currencies to
prop up exports and growth and the U.S. Federal Reserve's
bond-buying spree blamed for the dollar's weakening have spurred
fresh calls for coordination of national policies.
 But Montek Singh Ahluwalia told Reuters nations needed to be
realistic in their expectations of what could be achieved.
 ""The real issue is given that it is a problem, how do we
coordinate policy? I don't think you should be too demanding ...
because such policy coordination has never been attempted
before,"" he said on the sidelines of a G20 summit.
 ""I am hopeful we will get some agreement and I'm sure it will
take time.""
 Germany and several other nations have hit out at a U.S. plan
to consider setting specific limits on current account
imbalances, while some countries, notably China, have come in for
criticism for intervening in currency markets.
 Commenting of the possibility of adopting numerical targets
for current account surpluses and deficits in the summit's final
communique due on Friday, Ahluwalia said he did not think ""that's
where the discussions are going.""
 ""As and when numbers are decided that has to be on the basis
of some analytical work. Somebody has to do the exercise,"" he
said.
 ""We are handling a completely new set of things. So I don't
think one should expect an instant solution.""

 SEOUL, Nov 11 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on
Thursday the United States and China were ""making progress"" in
discussions on economic issues, but made only a guarded reference
to the divisive topic of Beijing's currency.
 ""As two of the world's leading economies we have a special
obligation to deal with ensuring strong balance and sustained
growth,"" Obama said at the start of a meeting with China's
President Hu Jintao on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Seoul.
 The United States says Beijing holds its yuan currency
artificially low against the U.S. dollar and argues it should be
allowed to rise to aid U.S. exports and jobs.
 Obama is pushing for specific commitments from other G20
leaders at this summit to tackle global imbalances -- shorthand
for the massive U.S. trade deficit and equally large trade
surpluses built up by countries such as China and Germany.
 It was Obama's seventh meeting with Hu, the most with any
foreign leader since the start of his presidency in January 2009
-- a record the White House says shows how highly Obama values
their relationship.
 ""The U.S.-China relationship, I think, has become stronger
over the last several years, as we've been discussing a whole
range of not only bilateral issues but world issues,"" he said.
 Hu struck the same tone of cooperation in his remarks.
 ""The Chinese side stands ready to work with the U.S. side to
increase dialogue, exchanges and cooperation so that we can move
forward the China-U.S. relationship on a positive, cooperative
and comprehensive track,"" Hu said. he said the G20 would yield a
""positive outcome"".

 VIENNA, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Austrian cranemaker Palfinger
raised its revenue growth outlook for 2010 on Thursday after
reporting third-quarter profit above market expectations thanks
to a recovery in its markets and cost cuts.
 Palfinger, whose competitors include Finland's Cargotec and
Konecranes, and Germany's Demag Cranes, reported July-September
earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 8.8 million euros.
 Analysts had forecast a profit of 7.4 million euros compared
with a small loss of 0.5 million in the same quarter last year.
 The company -- whose main product is truck-mounted cranes
often used by builders -- said it now expected revenue growth of
more than 20 percent for 2010, up from a 15 percent estimate it
gave in August.
 Citing a satisfactory business performance, it added that a
continuation of the ""underlying slight upward trend"" was
expected for the October-December period.

 * Japan business fears being left behind by South Korea
(Adds comments, background)
 TOKYO, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Japan aims to launch economic
partnership talks with the European Union next spring, the Nikkei
business daily said on Thursday, as Tokyo struggles to catch up
with Asian rival South Korea in sealing trade deals.
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan will propose the timetable to
European Council President Herman Van Rompuy and European
Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso on Friday on the
sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Seoul, the Nikkei said.
 Kan will convey Japan's willingness to tackle non-tariff
trade barriers, a condition the EU has set for opening
negotiations, the Nikkei said.
 Businesses are urging Japan's government to sign trade deals
to boost the competitiveness of electronics and automobile
exports in the face of fierce competition from South Korea, whose
pact with the European Union takes effect in July.
 Japan's exports to the EU came to more than $72 billion in
2009, while imports from the EU totalled more than $59 billion,
according to Japanese trade organisation JETRO.
 Tokyo said in a basic policy document unveiled on Saturday it
would seek a deal with the EU soon.
 The government's expression of interest in the Trans-Pacific
Partnership, a U.S.-led free trade pact, has sparked vocal
opposition from the agricultural lobby, which wields considerable
political clout due to an electoral system that places greater
weight on rural votes.
 But a bilateral Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) could
allow for the exclusion of sensitive agricultural products, the
Nikkei said.
 ""Whether or not Japan can make progress on free trade will be
a litmus test that determines whether it can maintain economic
growth,"" said Toshihiro Nagahama, chief economist at Dai-ichi
Seimei Research Institute.
 ""South Korea is ahead with both the United States and Europe.
If Japan doesn't make progress, it will be left behind,"" he
added, saying any negative effects of the deal would be
outweighed by the positive.
 An official at Japan's Trade Ministry said it had been
Japan's intention for some time to seek progress on trade at an
EU-Japan summit in spring 2011, but that she expected no fresh
steps at G20.
 Seoul and Washington failed to reach an agreement on
revamping an existing trade deal at a meeting on Thursday between
President Barack Obama and his South Korean counterpart Lee
Myung-bak in Seoul on the sidelines of the G20 summit.
 After the G20 meeting ends on Friday many of the leaders will
travel to Japan for a weekend summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, with the focus again on boosting trade
and shoring up economic growth.

 HONG KONG, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Emerging economies will need
capital controls to manage flows of ""hot money"" and ensure
economic stability in the wake of the United States' ultra-easy
monetary policy, Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz
said on Thursday.
 Some emerging countries, such as Brazil and Thailand, have
implemented some capital control measures to restrict a huge
influx of liquidity, especially since the United States unleashed
a second round of quantitative easing. [ID:nTOE6A403W]
 ""Right now we're in a very difficult period, and one that's
getting more difficult because a fraction of the world has moved
to a system with capital controls,"" Stiglitz told a news
conference.
 ""That will mean, almost inevitably, that we are going to be
moving into a new global regime in which we will have all kinds
of impediments on the flows of capital, of short-term capital,""
he said at a real estate conference in Hong Kong.
 Stiglitz, who won a Nobel Prize in economics in 2001, said
the way to ensure economic stability was for countries to curb
speculative inflows, but allow long-term investment that creates
jobs.
 Some countries could learn from China on controlling
speculative inflows to stabilise its economy, now the world's
second-largest, he said.
 ""China has had capital controls on short-term flows that have
worked, not perfectly, but have worked to stabilise these
short-term flows. But at the same time, it's been very open to
long-term investments,"" he said.
 South Korea is preparing fresh measures aimed at curbing
volatility in cross-border capital inflows, in addition to
restrictions unveiled in June on currency derivatives trades by
banks. [ID:nTOE6A808E]
 Stiglitz said it was worrying that some countries, such as
India, had no plans for capital controls as speculative money was
adding pressure to the economy and fuelling inflationary pressure
in certain market segments, such as property. [ID:nASF000056]
 ""Where I do have a worry is countries like India, where they
are debating how much intervention in the market we should have.
And there are people who say in India we shouldn't have capital
controls, even though Brazil's done it, China's done it.""
 On Hong Kong, even though the peg to the U.S. dollar has
fanned inflationary pressure, the authorities could use other
instruments to cool the markets, such as releasing more land to
curb sky-high property prices.
 ""U.S. monetary policy made a very big mistake under Greenspan
and Bernanke,"" said Stiglitz, a professor at Columbia University.
""Hong Kong should recognise that it is a very big mistake and use
a full gambit of instruments to stabilise the market.""

 * Obama says any deal must appeal to American public
(Writes through)
 By Patricia Zengerle and Jack Kim
 SEOUL, Nov 11 (Reuters) - The United States and South Korea
failed to revive a stalled free trade agreement on Thursday,
dealing a blow to both countries' leaders and putting a brake on
bilateral trade.
 U.S. President Barack Obama and South Korea's Lee Myung-bak
said negotiators would continue talks to address U.S. concerns
that the deal does not do enough to open South Korean markets to
U.S. beef and autos.
 ""We agreed that more time is needed to resolve detailed
issues and asked trade ministers to reach a mutually acceptable
deal as soon as possible,"" Lee told told a joint news conference
with Obama on the sidelines of a G20 summit.
 The deal, if ratified by the two countries' assemblies, would
be one of the largest free trade pacts ever. It is the largest
signed by the United States since the North American Free Trade
Agreement that went into effect in 1994.
 Studies said the deal would boost the $66.7 billion annual
two-way trade by as much as a quarter.
 Lee said negotiators would return to the table after the G20
meetings are over this week to try to resolve U.S. concerns, but
rejected the suggestion that trade between the two allies was on
a fundamentally unfair footing.
 ""U.S. trade (deficit) against South Korea is about $8 billion
a year. Americans seems to think it is very large; it may once
used to have been, but it's come down by a lot,"" Lee said, adding
the two were on more or less an even playing field when U.S.-made
parts and intellectual property rights were factored in.
 Obama said he was confident that the two sides would
eventually reach an agreement and was reassured of Lee's
commitment.
 ""President Lee and I agreed that we need to make sure that
over the next several weeks, we are crossing all the t's, dotting
all the i's, being able to make the case to both the Korean
people and the United States population that this is good for
both countries.
 ""... We don't want months to pass before we get this done, we
want this to be done in a matter of weeks.""
 AUTOS THE MAIN PROBLEM
 The two sides have been working frantically to address U.S.
congressional and industry demands for changes to the deal signed
in 2007 by the previous administrations of the two countries.
 Obama and Lee had set a deadline earlier this year of
resolving remaining concerns by the G20 summit.
 The failure to do so is an embarrassment for Obama who,
coming off a mid-term election setback last week, had
hoped to advance the pact and send a signal on U.S. commitment to
greater trade.
 U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk denied that the failure to
reach agreement was a defeat for Obama because the goal has been
to achieve a trade pact that worked for the United States.
 Mike Froman, an economic adviser to Obama, told reporters
that there were a number of sticking points but autos had been
the main obstacle to a deal.
 U.S. opponents of the trade pact wanted a slower phase-out of
tariffs on South Korean made cars and the removal of safety and
mileage standards that they feel act as non-tariff barriers to
American cars' entry into the Korean market.
 Analysts said the deal would be give a big boost to South
Korean companies such as Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors, which
already have surged in the U.S. market.
 Washington is under pressure to conclude a deal with Seoul
after South Korea signed a free trade agreement with the European
Union last month and plans to ratify it in time to enact it in
July next year.
 The United States has said South Korea's auto standards
discriminate against American cars and act as non-tariff
barriers, keeping their market share at less than 1 percent.
 Washington had also demanded South Korea drop restrictions on
beef imports from older cattle, a potentially explosive political
issue for Seoul, which said it would not give in on this issue.

 SEOUL, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Following are highlights from
comments made at the G20 summit on Thursday as leaders prepared
to meet to hammer out a deal to remedy global economic imbalances
and to defuse rows over currencies.
 U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA
 ""You will see at this summit a broad-based agreement from all
countries, including Germany, that we need to ensure balanced
sustainable growth.
 ""It is my expectation that the communique will begin to put
in place mechanisms that help us track and encourage such
balanced and sustainable growth.
 ""The most important thing that the United States can do for
the world economy is to grow because we continue to be the
world's largest market and a huge engine for all other countries
to grow, countries like Germany that export heavily benefit from
our open markets and us buying their goods. That is true for
every G20 member.""
 ""Now, as I've said I think when I was first asked this in
India, it's not our habit to comment on actions by the Federal
Reserve. But as President of the United States, I can tell you
that my instructions to my team, including Secretary Geithner, is
to focus every single day on how we can grow our economy, how we
can increase exports, how we can make sure that even as we're
buying goods from places like South Korea we're also selling
goods to places like South Korea.
 ""Countries like Germany historically are very sensitive to
issues like inflation. But I don't think you'll get any objection
to their belief that if the U.S. isn't growing, that's not good
for the rest of the world.
 ""It also doesn't negate the fact that if we -- if individual
countries are engaging in practices that are purposely designed
to boost their exports at the expense of others, that that can
contribute to problems as opposed to solving them.
 ""There's one last point I want to make about debt and
deficits, and that is that the single most important thing we can
do to reduce our debt and our deficits is to grow.""
 SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT LEE MYUNG-BAK
 ""I think eventually an agreement will be made to a certain
degree on various subjects including foreign exchange rates.
 ""We had reached an agreement (at finance minister meeting in
Gyeongju on the current account and foreign exchange policy
direction) despite scepticism that no agreement would be reached
because of a divide in opinion between U.S., China, Europe and
other countries.
 ""Macroeconomic imbalances is an issue that should be resolved
with urgency. But over the long term, I think development
imbalances is also an urgent issue to tackle.
 ""(Developing the underdeveloped countries) can contribute to
the long-term balance in the world economy.""
 U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY TIMOTHY GEITHNER
 ""The U.S. will never do that,"" Geithner told CNBC in an
interview in response to a suggestion by former Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan that Washington was pursuing a policy of
weakening the dollar.
 ""The dollar generally rose during that period of time and as
the world becomes more progressively confident, some of (those)
safe haven inflows have been reversed,"" he said referring to the
time 2-½ years ago when the dollar started to rise as a safe
haven at the start of the global financial crisis.
 ""That's been the dominant trend we see, that's very
encouraging.
 ""It's worth stepping back to see what are basic objectives
of this proposal and they are to make sure that as the world
recovers, we don't set in motion the types of forces that could
lead to re-emergence of excessive imbalances around the world --
deficits and surpluses -- because those would threaten our future
growth.""
 GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL
 ""For strong, balanced growth it is necessary to reduce the
global imbalances in the current accounts of countries.
 ""Only cooperative action could get us forward. The key to
reduce the existing imbalances is mainly to have flexible moving
exchange rates of the major currencies. They have to reflect the
economic fundamentals of the countries.
 ""Fixing limits for current account surpluses or deficits is
neither economically justified nor politically appropriate. This
would also be in contrast to the principles of free trade in the
world.
 ""It is important for me that the industrial countries had
promised to half their deficits by 2013 and to stabilize or
reduce their debt-ratio by 2016.""
 INDIAN CHIEF G20 NEGOTIATOR MONTEK SINGH AHLUWALIA
 ""The real issue is given that it is a problem, how do we
coordinate policy? I don't think you should be too demanding ...
because such policy coordination has never been attempted before.
 ""I am hopeful we will get some agreement and I'm sure it will
take time.
 ""As and when numbers are decided that has to be on the basis
of some analytical work. Somebody has to do the exercise.
 ""We are handling a completely new set of things. So I don't
think one should expect an instant solution.""
 CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER STEPHEN HARPER
 ""The persistence of these imbalances is a problem in the long
term and these things have to be addressed ... will they be
addressed at this conference? I'm not so sure, but I think we're
getting a more frank discussion on some of these matters, that
they do have to be resolved.
 ""I don't normally weigh in on the policy of another country
but those who are criticising the policy of the Federal Reserve
-- I'm not sure what alternative they are suggesting. The United
States economy has a very slow rate of growth. The United States
economy also has interest rates that are virtually zero ...
nobody is urging the United States to engage in fiscal expansion.
""So I think under the circumstances the quantitative easing
policy is in the short term, the only option available to the
Federal Reserve. And I'm not sure anyone else has provided any
compelling argument as to what alternative policy they would
pursue, at least in the short term.
 ""Now, even without quantitative easing, one has observed that
there has been a depreciation of the American dollar and an
appreciation in other currencies, including our own.""
 EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT JOSE MANUEL BARROSO
 ""What is important to know is that we have all the essential
instruments in place in the European Union and euro zone to act
if necessary, but I am not going to make any speculation,"" he
told reporters, when asked whether Brussels would need to act to
support Ireland.
 ""This summit is a credibility test -- the question is how far
we can go at this summit to agree on joint action so we can boost
global growth and jobs.
 ""The G20 has prevented the boat from sinking, we have picked
up speed but not all engines are working on full power, the G20
must show that it is indeed the premier forum for global economic
co-operation.
 ""I do not believe that mechanical one-size fits all numerical
targets are the solution to this challenge but indicative
guidelines can help to address broad imbalances.""
 EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT HERMAN VAN ROMPUY
 ""This should be used as a warning indicator for possible
obstacles to adjustment but we do not believe in mechanistic
approaches,"" he said, referring to current account imbalances.
 ""The European Union as a whole has a balanced current account
position.
 ""Exchange rates have to reflect fundamentals, but
fundamentals in themselves have to be corrected -- these are
fundamentals as far as inflation is concerned but also
fundamentals as far as current account balance of payments are
concerned.""
 ANGEL GURRIA, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE OECD
 On imbalances
 ""There will be an agreement. As always there are expectations
created before these meetings, and, as always, it's difficult to
meet expectations on each and every issue.
 ""There is enough focus, awareness, attention and weight on
the issue that it's going to be successfully addressed. It's
process. It will not start today and it won't finish today.
 ""In an economic and trading system there are certain rules
and expectations on prices -- and the exchange rate is a key
price -- that members are expected to abide by to bring about
adjustment of external balances.
 ""If one or several players -- especially if they are large
players -- do not abide by these expected rules of conduct, then
the system does not work as smoothly and you have tensions.""

* Geithner: U.S. won't weaken dollar to boost growth
(Updates with quotes on China from interview)
 By David Lawder
 SEOUL, Nov 11 (Reuters) - China cannot continue to resist
upward market pressure on its yuan currency without facing higher
inflation and rising asset prices, U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner said on Thursday.
 Geithner, in an interview with CNBC television on the
sidelines of a Group of 20 leaders summit, said he believed there
had been progress on China currency issues and authorities in
Beijing believed that it was important to let the appreciation
process continue.
 ""If you resist those market forces that are just a reflection
of confidence that you're going to see strong growth in China,
strong productivity growth in China, if you resist those market
forces, that pressure is not going to go away,"" Geithner said.
""It's just going to end up in higher inflation or higher asset
prices and that'll be bad for China.""
 A draft copy of the G20 leaders' final statement calls for
them to move ""toward more market determined exchange rates and
enhancing exchange rate flexibility rate flexibility to reflect
underlying economic fundamentals.""
 Geithner said this was important because countries that
resist such fundamental exchange rates pressures would only
increase problems for countries with more flexible currencies.
 ""What that means is all the pressure you see falls
disproportionately to those emerging market economies that allow
their currencies to move and that's unfair to them and creates a
set of broader tensions in the economy that are worth trying to
avoid,"" he said
 WEAKER DOLLAR IN U.S. INTEREST?
 Geithner also defended U.S. exchange rate policy, saying IN
the interview the United States would never deliberately weaken
the dollar.
 ""The U.S. will never do that,"" Geithner said, responding to a
suggestion by former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that
Washington was pursuing a policy of weakening the dollar.
 ""We will never seek to weaken our currency as a tool to gain
competitive advantage or to grow the economy,"" Geithner said.
""It's not an effective strategy for any country and it's not for
the U.S. We'll never do that.""
 Greenspan wrote in a Financial Times guest column published
on Wednesday that a weak U.S. dollar policy, coupled with the
suppression of China's yuan currency, was driving up exchange
rates in the rest of the world.
 Geithner attributed the dollar's weakness to a reversal of
safe-haven capital flows and a return to risk appetite. He said
two and a half years ago the dollar began rising because the
world was concerned about depression and systemic collapse and
sought ""the safety of the risk-free assets of the U.S.""
 ""The dollar generally rose during that period of time and as
the world becomes more progressively confident, some of (those)
safe haven inflows have been reversed,"" he told CNBC. ""That's
been the dominant trend we see, that's very encouraging,"" he
added.
 He also said that leaders from the Group of 20 wealthy and
emerging economies gathering in Seoul on Thursday and Friday will
endorse the G20 finance ministers agreement to avoid competitive
currency devaluation and limit excessive current account
imbalances.
 ""It's worth stepping back to see what are basic objectives of
this proposal and they are to make sure that as the world
recovers, we don't set in motion the types of forces that could
lead to re-emergence of excessive imbalances around the world --
deficits and surpluses -- because those would threaten our future
growth,"" he said.

350,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2010 11:40PM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Moody's upgrades China ratings on economic resilience," * Raises China govt bond rating to Aa3 with positive outlook
 * Cites solid growth, sound fiscal and external positions
 * Says bank losses after credit boom to be contained
 BEIJING, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service
upgraded China's government bond ratings on Thursday, citing its
resilient economic performance and sound balance of payments.
 Moody's raised China's government bond rating to Aa3 from A1
and maintained a positive outlook, it said in a statement.
 The move followed a change in the rating outlook in November
2009 to positive from stable and a review for possible upgrade
last month.
 The prospect of China's strong economic growth over the
medium term -- backed by the two-year 4 trillion yuan ($600
billion) stimulus programme launched in 2008 -- and the
country's solid external positions, justified the move, Moody's
said.
 Moody's expects China's economic growth to moderate to a
more sustainable rate of around 9-10 percent this year, and
perhaps 8-9 percent in 2011.
 Inflation is becoming a challenge, but the People's Bank of
China has taken tightening measures to tackle it, Moody's said.
 The PBOC raised reserve requirements twice for some banks on
Wednesday to mop up more of the cash that is coursing through
the economy, two sources said on Thursday. [ID:nTOE6AA01Z]
 China's exceptionally strong external position, reinforced
by its capital controls, would help the country to cope with
global financial market volatility and capital inflows, the
agency said.
 The government's fiscal positions remained healthy, with
the budget deficit likely to be contained within 3 percent of
GDP this year and next, despite the economic stimulus, it said.
 China's state-owned banks lent 9.6 trillion yuan last year,
to complement the stimulus package that helped China ride out
the global financial downturn.
 Critics have voiced fears that a lot of those loans,
especially those made to local governments, will turn sour,
saddling the banks with heavy losses and possibly requiring the
central government to organise a bailout.
 But Moody's said China's largest banks have not been
materially damaged by the global crisis and will be able to
absorb the bulk of any credit losses themselves -- either from
capital or from future earnings.
""Therefore, the dominant banks in the system will not likely
pose any sizable contingent liability risk to the government's
balance sheet,"" the ratings agency said.
 Still, China faces some long-term risks as it tries to
rebalance the economy while ensuring strong growth and creating
enough jobs to maintain social stability, Moody's said.
 External risks would be the most threatening over the near
term, including long-simmering trade frictions with the United
States over the value of the yuan , it said.

351,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2010 11:40PM ET</span>",FOREX-Dollar's comeback flags but still near key levels," * Dollar short-covering run stalls for now
 * Aussie slips after jobs data but rapidly recovers
 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, Nov 11 (Reuters) - The dollar lost steam on Thursday
after four days of gains but remained close to significant
barriers which if broken could see its short-covering rebound
stretch higher against the likes of the yen and euro.
 The Australian dollar dipped after Australia's unemployment
rate rose in October but it quickly pulled back above parity,
while the euro, pressured all week as euro zone debt worries
combine with long position unwinding, hovered near $1.3800.
 In Seoul G20 leaders were gathering to discuss currencies and
global economic imbalances. But negotiators wrangled over the
wording of a communique expected on Friday, and the statement was
not expected to venture much beyond a finance ministers'
agreement last month.
 After rising almost to its September pre-intervention low of
82.87 yen on Wednesday, the dollar was holding above 82.00 yen,
with a re-test of the 82.87 barrier not ruled out. But there was
talk of dollar sell orders from Japanese exporters above 82.50
yen, with more near-term resistance at 83 yen.
 ""Maybe 82 and 83 will be difficult for dollar/yen but at the
same time exporters' dollar orders will be absorbed by the market
and they will decrease,"" said Osamu Takashima, chief FX
strategist for Citibank Japan.
 ""When the orders decrease that will be positive for the
dollar in the medium term, over one or two months.""
 UBS analysts also said in a note that long-yen speculative
positioning remained high, increasing the risk of position
unwinding into the year end, while a rise in U.S.-Japan yield
differentials could also help.
 The dollar has pulled up from a 15-year low of 80.21 yen set
at the start of the month, just before the Federal Reserve's
long-anticipated decision to resume quantitative easing, and held
off revisiting its 1995 record low of 79.75 yen.
 On the charts, a break above the Sept. 15 low, set just
before Japanese authorities intervened to sell yen, would open
the way for a move up to the dollar's 2009 low of 84.82 yen. It
was down 0.1 percent on the day at 82.18 yen.
 The Veterans Day holiday in the United States, where some
markets will be shut, was helping keep the market subdued.
 CHINA INFLATION
 Chinese inflation sped to a 25-month high in October and bank
lending blew past expectations, pointing to the likelihood of
more policy tightening.
 But the market took the data calmly after speculation of a
higher CPI reading, and the Australian dollar, which can be
sensitive to the pace of Chinese growth due to demand for
Australian resources, rose 0.2 percent to $1.0060, while the New
Zealand dollar climbed 0.7 percent to $0.7872.
 The Aussie had briefly dipped below parity earlier in the
session after data showed Australia's jobless rate jumped as the
buoyant economy drew more people into the workforce -- a trend
that could lessen the need for higher interest rates.
 The dollar has rallied more than 3 percent against a basket
of major currencies in the past four sessions, breaking
above 78.0 for the first time in two weeks on Wednesday.
 However, it stopped short of October's highs at 78.273 and
78.364, resistance to beat if its correction is to extend much
higher. It was last at 77.548, down 0.1 percent.
 The euro, which hit a five-week trough of $1.3670 on
Wednesday, rose 0.1 percent to 1.3800. It has corrected sharply
from a 10-month high above $1.4280 set a week ago.
 Chartwise it needs to stay above the $1.3670 trough to avoid
a possible move down to $1.3363-1.3333. $1.3363 is the 38.2
percent retracement of its rally from June to November.
 It remains vulnerable to persistent worries about the fiscal
health of peripheral euro zone sovereigns and their ability to
fund themselves in markets.
 Ireland, the current hot spot, is battling to prove it does
not need a Greek-style rescue to help it reduce the worst budget
deficit in Europe. The country's central bank governor conceded
on Wednesday a huge bank recapitalisation programme had failed to
reassure investors.

said in a speech at the G20 business summit, according to a text

 ""Only cooperative action could get us forward. The key to

 Merkel said the leading rich countries had expressed their

promised to half their deficits by 2013 and to stabilize or

356,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2010 10:28PM ET</span>",South Korea-U.S. trade talks go down to the wire," By Jack Kim and Alister Bull
 SEOUL, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Last-minute negotiations on saving
a faltering free trade deal between the United States and South
Korea were taking place on Thursday, with trade officials leaving
the final haggling to their leaders, officials said.
 U.S. President Barack Obama and his South Korean counterpart,
Lee Myung-bak, were meeting in Seoul on the sidelines of a G20
summit, with the long-delayed FTA expected to dominate their
discussions.
 Obama and Lee set a deadline earlier this year of resolving
remaining concerns by the G20 summit.
 Trade officials are tight-lipped about the fate of the deal,
refusing to say if the drawn out negotiations between working
level officials had resolved outstanding issues on beef and
autos.
 They have left the final negotiating, which is believed to be
stuck on the issue of autos, to their presidents.
 ""As we have said previously, if we can reach the standard for
a fair trade agreement that the president has set out on
particularly autos, we will move forward. We hope to continue
making progress,"" a White House official said.
 A U.S. business source in Seoul for the G20 summit said that
South Korean Ambassador Han had indicated that negotiators had
gotten as far as they could with the talks and had now escalated
the decision to the two presidents. The business source was not
directly involved in the discussions.
 South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted a senior government
official as saying things were looking very difficult.
 ""We can't rule out the possibility that we won't reach a
complete agreement today and will have to continue discussions,""
said the official.
 A South Korean official refused to comment on whether
Minister for Trade Kim Jong-hoon and U.S. Trade Representative
Ron Kirk met at all on Thursday.
 Lee and Obama agreed last week in a telephone call that it
would be in their countries' interests to conclude the trade deal
soon, so their assemblies can enact it into law.
 The deal, which was signed in 2007, has been criticised in
the United States for not doing enough to open South Korean
markets to U.S. cars and beef.
 A failure to resolve differences could embarrass Obama who,
coming off a mid-term election setback last week, hoped to
advance the pact and send a signal on U.S. commitment to greater
trade.
 But many of Obama's fellow Democrats are demanding
substantial changes to the pact, especially in the auto
provisions, to open Korea's market to more American exports while
protecting American workers against a surge in imports.
 South Korea signed a free trade agreement with the European
Union last month, putting pressure on Washington to conclude a
deal with Seoul.
 Some South Korean media had reported Washington was dropping
the beef issue to win concessions from Seoul on autos.
 Washington has said South Korea's auto standards discriminate
against American cars and act as non-tariff barriers, keeping
their market share at less than 1 percent.

rise
 * Chinese bank shares stage mild rebound
 * Inflation tops expectations
(Adds links)
 BEIJING, Nov 11 (Reuters) - China raised reserve
requirements twice, not once, for some banks on Wednesday to
lock up more of the cash that is coursing through the economy,
two sources said on Thursday.
 The extra tightening step, which takes the required reserve
ratio to a record 18.5 percent for a number of the country's
biggest banks, is a sign of how serious officials are about
stamping down on liquidity as inflation rises to more than a
two-year high.
 The People's Bank of China said on Wednesday that it was
increasing required reserve ratios by 50 basis points for all
lenders. This followed a report earlier in the day by Reuters
that the central bank had targeted a few specific banks with a
reserve requirement increase.
 It had been unclear whether the central bank's announcement
was a confirmation of the earlier report or an additional
increase.
 Industry sources said certain banks had in fact been hit
with a special order on top of the sector-wide move, making for
a total increase of 100 basis points for at least Bank of China
and Bank of Communications.
 China's main stock index opened down but quickly reversed
direction and was up 0.8 percent at 0315 GMT. Bank shares,
which shed about 2 percent yesterday, also rebounded.
 Some analysts said that given the abundance of excess cash
in the economy, the reserve requirement increase would do
little to dent the stock market, which has risen 20 percent
since the start of October.
 China reported inflation data for October, along with a
host of other economic figures, on Thursday. The consumer price
index accelerated to a 25-month peak of 4.4 percent
year-on-year rise last month, much above consensus forecasts
for a 4 percent rise.
 Although Chinese officials have directed their ire at U.S.
monetary easing as a cause of unwanted speculative inflows,
data on Wednesday provided a reminder that a whopping trade
surplus is the main source of Beijing's liquidity headache.
 China has officially raised banks' reserve requirements
four times this year, while also clamping down on their credit
issuance to control money growth after an unprecedented lending
spree last year.
 The central bank raised interest rates last month for the
first time in nearly three years, and some analysts believe
that another increase could come before the end of the year.

 HONG KONG, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei stock index
rose to its highest since June on Thursday, adding to returns
that have outstripped U.S. and European markets in November,
while a blast of Chinese economic data sent copper prices to a
record high.
 European shares opened modestly higher with the
FTSEurofirst 300 up 0.2 percent, London's FTSE 100 up 0.5
percent and German's DAX up 0.4 percent. But U.S. stock index
futures were slightly weaker.
 Chinese consumer price inflation in October quicked to its
fastest pace in two years, which is likely to sharpen
complaints from Beijing and others that the Federal Reserve's
$600 billion money printing scheme will hasten capital flows to
their economies, complicating efforts to keep price pressures
at bay.
 Shares of large Chinese banks listed in Hong Kong rose on
the views that banks can take advantage of higher lending rates
while not necessarily paying more on deposits since in the near
term China has few choices but to keep raising interest rates.
 ""China's process of normalising monetary conditions is
going to accelerate,"" said Dong Tao, chief economist for
non-Japan Asia at Credit Suisse in Hong Kong.
 ""Inflation is higher than expected and, more importantly,
the authorities are giving up the thought that inflation is
going to peak soon, which means that they have to take a new
look at the inflation outlook and also take the so-called
quantitative easing into consideration.""
 China's complaints are being aired at a contentious Group
of 20 leaders meeting in Seoul that kicked off on Thursday. A
breakthrough on alleviating economic imbalances could herald
knee-jerk buying of risky assets and halt a U.S. dollar rally
that has lifted it to a 1-month high.
 The Nikkei rose 0.3 percent after closing on Wednesday
above the 38.2 percent retracement of the move down since April
to 2010 lows in September. That level is important for traders
who use historical chart patterns to make decisions.
 Shares of big exporters such as Toyota Motor Co and Canon
Inc were among the biggest lifts to the index, with the dollar
up nearly 2 yen in November.
 This month, the 7.4 percent gain in the Nikkei, Asia's
second-worst performing equity index year to date, is higher
than the 3 percent rise in the U.S. S&P 500 index and the
roughly 2 percent increase in the FTSEurofirst 300 index
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
surrendered early gains to stand little changed by late
afternoon, threatening to extend a string of three down days
after South Korea recorded its biggest single day of net
foreign selling of shares.

 Bank stocks were leading the charge, with some investors

between lending and deposit rates. Chinese banks were some of
the biggest decliners in the prior session, suggesting some
value-driven investing as well.
 Credit Suisse analysts said Chinese banks and insurers will
probably benefit the most from higher interest rates and stable
growth, but runaway inflation poses explosive risks, namely
bursting bubbles in Hong Kong.
 ""With its economy closely linked with the overheating
Chinese economy but its monetary policy linked to the U.S.
under the dollar peg, HK is now a hotbed for asset bubbles,""

 The Australian dollar was trading nearly unchanged on the
day at US$1.0038, fighting back after the country's
unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 5.4 percent, reducing
the chances of a rate increase in February, and China's
higher-than-expected CPI.
 With the fundamental outlook for Australia still
convincingly positive, the Reserve Bank of Australia may have
to raise rates again in coming months and therefore the
currency would unlikely stay down for long.
 ""Strong levels of participation are consistent with a
strong and healthy labour market. Unemployment remains in the
5.1-5.4 percent that has been in all year. It remains
consistent with the RBA's tightening bias,"" said Su-Lin Ong,
senior economist with RBC Capital Markets in Sydney.
 The U.S. dollar index a measure of the currency's
performance against a basket of six other major currencies, was
down 0.1 percent though up 2.3 percent since the Fed announced
its new bond buying programme.
 Bets against the dollar had grown significant in the run-up
to the Fed's highly anticipated quantitative easing last week,
causing dealers to trim positions with an eye on the year end.
 Commodity traders took advantage of the pause on the
dollar's rally and focused on the solid retail sales and
investment numbers out of China.
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose to a
record high of $8,966 a tonne. When the China's data first
started to emerge copper was flat at $8,760.
 Crude for December delivery was up 0.7 percent to $88.39 a

 Tokyo intervened in the currency market in September to

 By Bill Tarrant and Yoko Nishikawa
 YOKOHAMA, Japan, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Asia-Pacific ministers on
Thursday agreed to extend a freeze on trade barriers and pledged
to work toward creating a vast free trade area in the world's
fastest growing region.
 But a Group of 20 (G20) summit of major economies in
neighbouring South Korea -- beset by deep divisions over
currencies, monetary policy and global trade imbalances -- is
towering over the meeting of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum in Yokohama, south of Tokyo.
 Nine of APEC's members also belong to the G20, including the
world's biggest economies -- China, Japan and the United States.
APEC leaders meet in Yokohama at the weekend, immediately after
the Seoul G20 summit.
 The APEC ministers agreed to extend a freeze on any fresh
protectionist measures, which they first agreed at the height of
the financial crisis in 2008, for another three years.
 They also urged a conclusion to the moribund Doha round of
free trade talks by the end of next year.
 ""While (the) world economy is on its way to recovery,
however, there remains a possibility of increasing protectionist
pressures in the future,"" the statement said.
 A Japanese government official said it would send a message
about free trade to the G20 meeting.
 ""(The intention to) create the impetus for trade
liberalisation here was shown at a very high level,"", the
official said.
 GROWTH STRATEGY
 APEC ministers also championed a regional strategy of
balanced and sustainable growth, an elusive goal at a time when
the global economy is divided between cash-rich exporters and
debt-burdened importers.
 That could feature as well in the G20 summit. U.S. President
Barack Obama said on Thursday he expected the summit to outline
mechanisms that will deliver broad-based and balanced global
economic growth.
 The APEC ministers said they would take concrete steps to
create a vast Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) in the
region, home to 40 percent of the world's population and 53
percent of global economic output, by building on existing pacts.
 Businesses have long urged a single pact for the Pacific rim,
where scores of small FTAs have been agreed, to simplify a
plethora of standards and rules.
 One of the ""building blocks"" for the FTAAP is a U.S.-led
initiative called the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) that would
link nine nations, APEC ministers said. Host Japan has said it
wants to start talks on the TPP, but has run into fierce
opposition from the politically powerful farm lobby.
 An Asia-Pacific free trade area would link the world's top
economies with some of its fastest-growing ones such as
Indonesia, Thailand and Mexico.
 Despite the expected warm words on free trade, security
tensions could spill over into the economic realm, while rivalry
over resources from oil and gas to rare earth metals risks
fuelling strategic conflicts in turn.
 Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan, his ratings tumbling over
his handling of a row with China, is hoping to meet Chinese
President Hu Jintao on the sidelines of the APEC summit, but said
whether the bilateral talks took place depended on Beijing.
 Sino-Japanese relations have soured due to the feud over
rival claims to isles near potentially huge gas and oil reserves.
 Japan's ties with Russia also chilled after Russian President
Dmitry Medvedev visited another disputed island.
 Washington's ties with Asia are also facing scrutiny as U.S.
President Barack Obama, who will arrive in Yokohama following the
G20 summit, seeks to boost exports and promote domestic jobs in
the wake of his Democratic Party's devastating election defeat.

 YOKOHAMA, Japan, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Asia-Pacific trade and
foreign ministers wrap up talks on Thursday, expected to promise
to avoid protectionism and work toward creating a vast free trade
area in the world's fastest growing economic region.
 But the meeting of ministers of the 21-member Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum is overshadowed by a Group of
20 summit of major economies in neighbouring South Korea where
deep divisions have emerged over currencies, monetary policy and
global trade imbalances.
 Nine of APEC's members are also in the G20, including the
world's biggest economies -- China, Japan and the United States.
APEC leaders meet in Yokohama at the weekend, immediately after
the Seoul G20 summit.
 On Wednesday, the APEC ministers agreed to avoid taking any
new protectionist measures for the next three years, and urged a
conclusion of the Doha round of trade liberalisation talks in
2011, Japanese officials said.
 The ministers said they would also build on the 43 bilateral
and mini-free trade pacts with each other to create to free a
trade area in the region, home to 40 percent of the world's
population and 53 percent of global economic output.
 Businesses have long urged a single pact for the Pacific rim
to simplify a plethora of standards and rules.
 The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
-- most of whom are APEC members -- has its own free trade area
and is building an EU-style economic community.
 ASEAN also has various pacts with APEC members China, Korea,
Japan, Australia and New Zealand.
 Those agreements, and a U.S.-led one called the Trans-Pacific
Partnership (TPP) that is being negotiated among nine nations,
will be the main building blocks of the Free Trade Area of the
Asia-Pacific (FTAAP).
 Host Japan has said it wants to start talks with other
countries on the TPP, but the government has run into fierce
opposition from the politically powerful farm lobby which worries
that the agricultural sector could be swept aside if it has to
face open competition.
 An Asia-Pacific free trade area would link the world's top
economies with some of its fastest-growing ones such as
Indonesia, Thailand and Mexico.
 Despite the expected warm words on free trade, regional
security rivalries as the region adjusts to an increasingly
assertive China are simmering in the background.
 The security tensions could spill over into trade and
investment, while rivalry over resources from oil and gas to rare
earth metals risks fuelling strategic conflicts in turn.
 Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan, his ratings tumbling over
his handling of a row with China, is hoping to meet Chinese
President Hu Jintao on the sidelines of a Nov. 13-14 APEC summit
in Yokohama, south of Tokyo.
 Sino-Japanese relations took a sharp dive due to a feud over
claims to isles in the East China Sea near potentially huge
maritime gas and oil reserves.
 Japan's ties with Russia also chilled after Russian President
Dmitry Medvedev visited part of an island chain north of Japan
claimed by both countries.
 Washington's ties with Asia are also facing scrutiny as U.S.
President Barack Obama, who will arrive in Yokohama following the
G20 summit, seeks to boost exports and promote domestic jobs in
the wake of his Democratic Party's devastating election defeat.

 * Trade pact talks with South Korea going down to wire
 
 By Alister Bull and Patricia Zengerle
 SEOUL, Nov 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama will
hold delicate meetings with China and South Korea on Thursday as
he seeks to advance key security issues while navigating tough
talks on currencies and trade.
 Any sign of confrontation, particularly with China, could
have an impact on financial markets.
 Obama, visiting a G20 summit here during a 10-day Asian tour
to boost exports and jobs, will be judged harshly by the region
if he cannot advance a trade pact with Seoul that many see as a
litmus test of his true commitment to trade.
 ""If we're serious about creating jobs in the United States,
we need to see action on this agreement,"" said Tom Donohue,
president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
 Talks on the long-stalled pact, which was signed by Obama's
predecessor George W. Bush in 2007 but then hit obstacles in the
U.S. Congress, were going down to the wire, officials said.
 Obama has a meeting and a working lunch with South Korean
President Lee Myung-Bak, and they are due to hold a joint press
conference at 2.00 p.m. (0500 GMT).
 Analysts say Asian leaders understand anti-trade pressures
are building back home for Obama. His Democrats were hammered in
elections last week over high unemployment, and the leaders want
to see how he will stand up to protectionist forces.
 ""If you can't pass an agreement you've already negotiated,
it is really bad,"" said Ernie Bower, at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies in Washington. ""If they can do that,
and spend the political capital, that's going to be very
reassuring for the rest of Asia.""
 Obama's meeting with Lee is also likely to discuss North
Korea, where they are partnered in a diplomatic push on its
nuclear weapons program, as well as mounting regional tensions
linked to China's increasing assertiveness.
 
 DELICATE DIPLOMACY
 Beijing is also an important part of the international push
to curb North Korea's nuclear weapons and the topic will be on
the table when Obama meets with Chinese President Hu Jintao at
3.30 p.m. (0630 GMT)
 China sided with Obama earlier this year in bringing tough
new U.N. sanctions against Iran for its nuclear program, but the
partnership has frayed when it comes to financial diplomacy.
 The United States wants Beijing to allow its yuan currency
to appreciate faster against the dollar, which U.S. officials
say is held down through intervention at the cost of U.S. jobs.
 Obama maintained this argument in a letter to G20 leaders
obtained by Reuters on Wednesday.
 ""Just as the United States must change, so to must those
economies that have previously relied on exports to offset
weaknesses in their own demand,"" he said, in a clear reference
to China and fellow export power Germany.
 Both the Chinese and Germans have pushed back by criticizing
the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision last week to pump another
$600 billion into the U.S. economy in the hopes of stimulating
growth.
 Obama stoutly defended the Fed's action during a press
conference in New Delhi on Monday, when Indian Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh emphatically sided with his guest, and refreshed
this argument in the G20 letter.
 ""The dollar's strength ultimately rests on the fundamental
strength of the U.S. economy,"" he said, rejecting German
allegations that the Fed was deliberately weakening the dollar
to boost U.S. competitiveness.
 Obama meets German Chancellor Angela Merkel at 5.00 pm (0800
GMT). She has been much milder in her comments than some members
of her cabinet, notably Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, and
in her recent comments has stressed the importance of avoiding
confrontation at the summit.

 SINGAPORE, Nov 11 (Reuters) - The wave of money streaming
into Asia is ""reasonable"" and the region is in a much better
position to manage the inflows than previously, U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner said.
 In an interview with Singapore's Straits Times newspaper,
Geithner also called on Asian countries to let their currencies
strengthen further to reduce the risk of higher inflation and
asset bubbles.
 The influx of liquidity ""seems to me reasonable; it's
rational, not surprising, and fundamentally desirable compared
to the alternative"", he said.
 ""These are easier risks to manage than any of the risks we
faced as a global economy together over the last two-and-a-half
years of crisis,"" the newspaper quoted him as saying.
 Geithner, who was in Singapore on Wednesday enroute to a
G20 leaders' meeting in Seoul, said the United States'
objective during the meeting was to sustain momentum on
financial reform and underscore its commitment to keep markets
open.
 The interview carried no reference to the Federal Reserve's
""quantitative easing"", which Asian governments say is weakening
the dollar and stoking capital inflows and inflation in
emerging markets.
 Leaders of the Group of 20 rich and developing countries
will begin a two-day meeting in Seoul on Thursday in a bid to

apart from agreeing on a common stance.

follow the example of major competitors like Germany and China
that have used exports to propel economic growth, a top White
House official said on Wednesday.
 With U.S. unemployment still near 10 percent, President
Barack Obama has increasingly touted trade as a way to generate
jobs without requiring new federal spending that would add to
the huge U.S. budget deficit.
 ""We're going to grow our way out of this and exports are
going to be an important component of that. For that, all
patriotic Americans can agree. Because the American economy has
never taken a back seat to anybody and we are not about to
start now,"" White House economic adviser Austan Goolsbee said
in a video posted on the White House website.
 Obama, whose party took a beating in last week's
congressional election, has carried the export message on his
current trip to Asia. He has already visited India and
Indonesia and will also stop in South Korea and Japan.
 Earlier this year, Obama set a goal of doubling U.S.
exports to $3.14 trillion dollars by the end of 2014.
 ""That would be a significant increase. In fact, the biggest
increase that any country has ever had. But we believe that we
can do it,"" Goolsbee said.
 For most of the last 10 years, the United States depended
""almost entirely"" on increasing consumption to fuel economic
growth while competitors like Germany and China ""were putting
greater and greater focus on exporting,"" he said.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a one-month
high on Wednesday after data pointed to an improving U.S. labor
market while Wall Street rose as investors set aside recent
worries whether a rally would continue.
 But global stocks fell as Ireland's borrowing costs hit
another euro lifetime high and investors worried that a Federal
Reserve move announced last week to buy $600 billion in
Treasury debt to bolster the U.S. economy may have unintended
consequences.
 The dollar extended gains as a rise in U.S. bond yields for
most of the session prompted traders to reduce bets against the
greenback. Oil prices soared to their highest level in 25
months, breaking their recent strong inverse correlation with
the dollar. For details see: [ID:nN10217810] [ID:nSGE6A906T]
 Investors have sold dollars in recent months and bet that
the Fed's plans to pump more money into the U.S. economy to
boost growth would drive already low U.S. rates even lower. So
far, those expectations have been frustrated.
 ""The U.S. yield curve has steepened, and since the whole
world has had the same position on, we've got a lot of
end-of-the-year, risk management going on,"" said Sebastien
Galy, senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas.
 The euro fell as low as $1.3671 and was last changing hands
at $1.3777 , barely lower on the day.
 The dollar climbed as high as 82.79 Japanese yen , up
more than 1.0 percent, and last traded at 82.23.
 A decline in initial U.S. jobless claims had some analysts
suggesting the American economy was starting to gain traction
after months of sluggish growth. [ID:nN0986897]
 Global stocks slipped 0.7 percent, as measured by MSCI's
all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS>, but Wall Street rose.
 Trading in Tokyo was poised to open lower, with the
December futures contract that trades in Chicago for the Nikkei
225 <0#NK:> down 20 points at 9,860.
 U.S. stocks gained as rising oil prices lifted energy
shares and banks rebounded after suffering 3 percent losses
over the past two sessions.
 The S&P 500 Financials index <.GSPF> gained 1.4 percent and
was the best performer of the S&P 500's top 10 sectors. The S&P
energy index <.GSPE> ended up 1.3 percent as U.S. crude for
December delivery  settled at $87.81 a barrel, the
highest close since October 2008.
 Oil has gained seven of the last eight sessions, pushing
prices up $6.38 a barrel, or 7.8 percent.
 Stocks still have upside momentum, especially after falling
about 1 percent in the previous two sessions, said Randy
Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at the Schwab
Center for Financial Research in Austin, Texas.

or 0.62 percent, at 2,578.78.
 U.S. stocks were down earlier as investors worried the Fed
might buy less debt than planned, while others feared the
increased liquidity has propelled commodity prices higher,
which could induce a harmful bout of inflation.
 U.S. cotton futures charged to an all-time high but closed
sharply lower for the first time in nine sessions as heavy
investor selling and profit-taking finally deflated the
market's record run, analysts said. [ID:nSGE6A902R]
 Precious metals, however, steadied after futures of gold,
and particularly silver, plunged in after-hour trade the
previous session. [ID:nLDE6A90S9]

 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled down
$10.80 an ounce at $1,399.30 in New York.
 Silver for December delivery  settled down $2.041, or
7.1 percent, at $26.865 in its biggest loss in two years.
 U.S. Treasuries slid in volatile trade after a weak auction
of 30-year government debt, although bargain hunting pulled
bonds off the day's lows and led a rebound. [ID:nN10192793]
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
8/32 in price to yield 2.63 percent.
 The poor bond auction highlighted worries that demand for

curve was sidelined by the Fed's $600 billion purchase plan.

 NEW YORK, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hit a
one-month high against the euro and yen on Wednesday, as rising
U.S. bond yields prompted traders to cut bets against the
greenback but some gains were lost late in the day.
 Worries about Ireland's high debt burden kept the euro weak
against the dollar for a fourth straight day though the euro
was well off the session low in volatile trading after a U.S.
Treasury bond auction attracted mediocre demand.
 Better U.S. economic data, including a decline in weekly
initial jobless claims, had some analysts suggesting the U.S.
economy was gaining traction after months of frustratingly slow
growth. For details, see [ID:nN10164638]
 Investors had sold dollars in recent months on expectations
the Federal Reserve's plans to pump more money into the economy
to boost growth would drive already low U.S. yields even lower,
but so far those expectations have been frustrated.
 ""The U.S. yield curve has steepened, and since the whole
world has had the same position on, we've got a lot of
end-of-the-year, risk management going on,"" said Sebastien
Galy, senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas.
 The euro fell as low as $1.3671 and was last changing hands
at $1.3774 , little changed on the day. The session peak
was $1.3826.
 ""We had that drop real strong, then saw Asian central banks
and Middle East names buying the euro and keeping it above
$1.3750,"" said Dean Malone, a currency director at Compass FX
in Dallas, Texas.
 The $1.3650 level is the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement
of the low from September 10 to the November 4 high and it
seems investors are defending it, Malone said.
 BNP Paribas said it could fall as far as $1.3435 as it
retraces a multi-month rally that peaked last month at $1.4281,
a 9-1/2-month high.
 YEN FALLS
 The dollar climbed as high as 82.79 yen , up more
than 1.0 percent, as U.S. yields rose relative to Japanese ones
though some trading on Wednesday may motivated by technical
factors and it last traded at 82.28 yen.
 At the session peak of 82.79, dollar/yen broke through the
50-day simple moving average of 82.77 though it failed to hold.
It was the first breach of that average since it last traded
above that level on September 21.
 Those levels may provide resistance to further dollar
gains. Using the 14-day relative strength index, dollar/yen has
gone into overbought territory for the first time since April
5, another sign that the dollar may struggle against the yen.
 The dollar briefly extended gains against the euro and yen,
climbing to a session peak against the yen on electronic
trading platform EBS in a kneejerk reaction to a weak 30-year
Treasury bond auction. The release of a Federal Reserve
schedule for purchasing government securities over the coming
month added to the volatility.
 The dollar then gave up gains against the euro in what
analysts said was position adjustment after the auction.
 FUNDING CURRENCY QUESTIONS
 Elsewhere, sterling rose 0.8 percent to $1.6114 
after a Bank of England inflation report made further monetary
easing in the UK look less likely [ID:nLDE6A91AO]. The euro
fell 0.8 percent to 85.47 pence .
 The euro struggled after Portugal was forced to pay a
higher premium than previously at a bond auction and after
Ireland's central banker said Irish bond yields were at ""crisis
levels."" The gap between benchmark Irish and German bond yields
expanded to a euro lifetime high. [GVD/EUR]

coordination this time, there is a risk that everyone will go
their own way, taking their own measures,"" said Raphael
Martello, an economist at Tendencias consultancy in Sao Paulo.
 That could mean more intervention measures in Brazil, which
has been struggling to contain a rise in the real.
 Further tax increases on foreign purchases of local bonds
or a reinstatement of income tax for foreigners on those bonds
are the most likely options, said Martello.
 MEXICAN PESO OUTPERFORMS
 The Mexican currency  gained 0.52 percent to 12.2365
per dollar after a U.S. government report showed jobless claims
fell more than expected in the latest week.
 Mexico is less reliant on the commodity trade with China,
exporting mainly to the United States.
 ""The peso is reacting favorably to the jobs data,"" said
Antonio Magana, a currency trader at Interacciones brokerage in
Mexico City. ""I think investors will move to sell dollars now
that the peso is looking to break the 12.2000 level.""
 The peso pared some gains after a sale of U.S. 30-year
Treasury bonds was met with the weakest demand in a year.
[ID:nN10194812]
 That sale also pushed down the price of Mexican debt,
causing a 10 basis-point spike in the yield on Mexico's
benchmark 10-year bond .
 Meanwhile, Peru took advantage of growing demand for
emerging market debt, selling $2.5 billion in two bonds
maturing in 10 and 40 years. [ID:nN10204173]
 The Chilean peso  weakened 0.85 percent to 481.1 per
dollar as the price of copper, the country's main export, fell
sharply.
 Two central bank polls from the Andean country on Wednesday
showed the market expects Chile's peso to appreciate to 475 per
dollar by next week but settle at 480 in January.

 * Dollar hits one-month highs vs euro, yen as yields rise
 * Sterling gains on BoE inflation outlook
 * U.S. data adds to upward pressure on dollar, yields
(Updates prices, adds comment, details)
 NEW YORK, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a one-month
peak against the euro and yen on Wednesday as higher U.S. bond
yields prompted traders to cut bets against the greenback. 
 Fear about Ireland's high debt burden left investors
seeking shelter in German bunds, which also kept the euro weak
against the dollar for a fourth straight day though it was well
off the session low in volatile trading after a U.S. Treasury
bond auction.
 Strong U.S. economic data, including a decline in initial
jobless claims, even had some analysts suggesting the U.S.
economy was gaining traction after months of frustratingly slow
growth. For details, see
 Investors had sold dollars in recent months and bet that
the Federal Reserve plans to pump more money into the economy
to boost growth would drive already low U.S. rates even lower.
So far, those expectations have been frustrated.
 ""The U.S. yield curve has steepened, and since the whole
world has had the same position on, we've got a lot of
end-of-the-year, risk management going on,"" said Sebastien
Galy, senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas.
 The euro fell as low as $1.3671 and was last changing hands
at $1.3771, little changed on the day.
 ""We had that drop real strong, then saw Asian central banks
and Middle East names buying the euro and keeping it above
$1.3750,"" said Dean Malone, a currency director at Compass FX
in Dallas, Texas.
 The 1.3650 level is the 38.2 percent retracement of the low
from September 10 to the November 4 high and it seems investors
are defending it, Malone said.
 BNP Paribas said it could fall as far as $1.3435 as it
retraces a multi-month rally that peaked last month at $1.4281,
a 9-1/2-month high.
 YEN FALLS
 The dollar climbed as high as 82.79 yen, up more than 1
percent, as U.S. yields rose relative to Japanese ones though
some trading on Wednesday may be technical as it last traded at
82.31 yen.
 At the session peak of 82.79, dollar/yen broke through the
50-day simple moving average of 82.77 though it failed to hold.
It was the first breach of that average since it last traded
above that level on September 21. 
 Dollar/yen also broke through the 50-day exponential moving
average of 82.69 for the first time since it last traded above
that measure on September 17.
 Those levels may provide resistance to further dollar
gains. Using the 14-day relative strength index, dollar/yen has
gone into overbought territory for the first time since April
5, another sign that the dollar may struggle against the yen.
 The dollar briefly extended gains against the euro and yen,
climbing to a session peak against the yen on electronic
trading platform EBS in a kneejerk reaction to the 30-year
Treasury bond auction.
 The prices of U.S. Treasury securities fell on Wednesday
with bond yields moving higher following a weak $16 billion
sale of 30-year bonds by the U.S. Treasury Department.
 But the dollar then gave up gains against the euro in what
analysts said was position adjustment after the auction.
 FUNDING CURRENCY QUESTIONS
 Elsewhere, sterling rose 0.8 percent to $1.6113 after a
Bank of England inflation report made further monetary easing
in the UK look less likely. The euro fell 0.8 percent to 85.48
pence.
 The euro struggled after Portugal was forced to pay a
higher premium than previously at a bond auction and after
Ireland's central banker said Irish bond yields were at ""crisis
levels."" The gap between benchmark Irish and German bond yields
expanded to a euro lifetime high.

 * De Gucht: Any ""green"" border tax could cause ""trade war""
 
 (Recasts first paragraph, adds quotes and detail)
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The European Union will step up
resistance to cheap Chinese imports arising from the country's
generous state aid programmes and threatening EU businesses, the
bloc's trade chief said on Wednesday.
 ""They subsidise nearly everything,"" Trade Commissioner Karel
De Gucht told Reuters in an interview.
 ""We are going to become much more precise in reacting to
that kind of practice. We are focusing more and more on
subsidiation (subsidies), because it works horizontally in all
sectors,"" he added.
 The 27-nation EU has used anti-dumping procedures to ward
off cheap Chinese imports that have led to a 133 billion euro
($182.7 billion) trade deficit with China. The bloc can also
challenge Chinese subsidies by increasing import tariffs.
 Exports from China are expected to increase even more when
the EU formally recognises China as a market economy, expected
to happen in 2016 at the latest.
 European industrial giants from steel, construction and
electronics sectors have called for years for the EU to go
further in challenging Chinese subsidies they say are illegal
and should trigger EU trade barriers.
 De Gucht said the EU would also demand Chinese assurances it
would meet EU needs for rare earth -- used in high-tech and
defense products -- while Europe finds other sources of supply,
though it has no grounds yet for legal action against Beijing.
 China accounts for 97 percent of rare earths production. Its
moves to restrict exports have alarmed industry and governments
worldwide and triggered a rush for alternative deposits.
 Senior EU officials will press Chinese counterparts for an
agreement on medium-term supplies during a meeting in December.
 ""If need be, we will certainly go to the WTO (World Trade
Organization) but ... up to now there is no conclusive evidence
that our European businesses are hampered by this,"" the 56-old
lawyer and former Belgian foreign minister said.
 ""It's better to come to a negotiated agreement whereby the
interim is covered by clear arrangements ... instead of getting
into a fight.""
 De Gucht said the EU might consider scrapping preferential
trade tariffs for countries such as China and Russia if they
limit certain important exports.
 De Gucht's office will unveil reform plans for the EU's
so-called Generalised System of Preferences, of which China and
Russia are beneficiaries, early next year.
 ""I think you could expect from a country (to) whom you are
granting a substantial advantage that they do not make your life
hard if it is not necessary,"" he said.
 China has defended its export restrictions, citing
protection of a diminishing resource and the environment --
issues expected to be discussed at this week's G20 summit.
 
 DOHA TRADE ACCORD
 Some G20 leaders are also likely to use their meeting this
week in South Korea to press the United States to agree to
restart talks on the Doha global trade accord at the WTO, De
Gucht said.
 Efforts to revive the negotiations, which have been stalled
since 2008, have failed partly because of U.S. doubts about how
much the country will gain from a deal.
 ""We should the utmost to convince our American friends that
they have an interest in this deal and that the assumptions they
are making on Doha are not correct,"" De Gucht said.
 ""GREEN"" BORDER TAX
 But he rejected calls for an EU import tax on goods made
under less stringent environmental conditions than in the EU,
saying that would pose the risk of multiple lawsuits.
 France and Germany have said a ""green"" border tax is
critical for securing the competitiveness of EU producers
burdened by environmental rules that add to their costs.
 The U.S. Congress has debated such a tax and the issue is
likely to come up at a summit of EU and U.S. leaders next week.
 ""I fear very much that (a border tax) could end up in a
trade war. I'm certainly not in favour of this,"" De Gucht said.
 The EU's executive Commission has no plans to draft such a
tariff, but may reconsider if other major trading or economic
blocs took such a step, he added.

380,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2010 02:04PM ET</span>",INTERVIEW-UPDATE 1-SEB CEO sees capital debate only next year," * SEB CEO sees no talk on returning capital until Feb
 * Says economic conditions more worrying than previous qtr
 * Says Baltics is picking up, but many NPLs to be digested
 * Sees little reason for consolidation in the Nordics
 
 By Mia Shanley and Sven Nordenstam
 STOCKHOLM, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Swedish bank SEB wants to hold
off on talking about returning excess capital to shareholders
until at least early next year, the group's chief executive said
on Wednesday.
 SEB's Annika Falkengren, in a Reuters interview, said such a
discussion probably should not start until the next earnings
release in February. She also said business in the Baltic states
was slowly improving and downplayed prospects for bank
consolidation in the Nordic region.
 Nordic banks' shares have shot up in the past year, partly
on hopes the groups -- which had built up generous capital
cushions in the wake of the global financial crisis -- might
soon start handing back extra cash to investors.
 ""I guess being vocal about that, will probably be ... in
February, after year-end, when we close this year,"" Falkengren
said, referring to possible extra payouts to investors. ""Today
it is too premature.""
 Questions remained about how capital rules would be applied
and she said SEB wanted to keep some capital on hand for growth
opportunities. Meanwhile, economic conditions were more worrying
than a quarter ago, giving extra reason to be careful.
 Falkengren said after several quarters of heavy losses from
economic turmoil in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, SEB now sees
signs of stabilisation and has scaled back loan loss provisions.
 ""There are still a lot of non-performing loans to be
digested. But we are seeing more signs from individuals and from
the corporate side that it's slowly coming back,"" she said.
 
 CLEAR VISION
 Five years ago to the day, Falkengren, who has been ranked
among the 10 most powerful women in the world by Fortune 500
magazine, took over as CEO of a bank where she began her career
as a trainee in the late 1980s.
 She has a clear view as to where SEB's future lies. ""Our DNA
is really corporate and institutions,"" Falkengren said.
 That means serving all clients, both retail and corporate,
in Sweden and the Baltics, but focusing only on wholesale
banking in other locales. Growth will probably be
self-generated, not through acquisitions, she added.
 As for other banks in the Nordics, Falkengren sees little
reason for major merger and acquisition activity for now.
 ""It's easy to make a merger if someone is really suffering
for example. I think we will see in Europe a lot of banks will
not be able to raise capital, and of course consolidation will
be an issue in a European perspective,"" she said. ""I don't see
the same drivers in the Nordic markets.""
 SEB had a Core Tier 1 ratio at the end of the third quarter
of 12.1 percent. Analysts believe Nordic banks' high capital
levels risk making them less profitable than European rivals.
 Falkengren herself said the old days of 20 percent returns
on equity were probably over, with returns closer to 15 percent
more likely now.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a one-month
high on Wednesday after data pointed to an improving U.S. labor
market while global stocks slipped as investors worried about
the Federal Reserve's plans to reinvigorate the U.S. economy.
 The dollar extended gains as higher U.S. bond yields
prompted traders to reduce bets against the greenback. For
details, see [ID:nN10213278].
 Investors have had second thoughts about the Fed's move
announced last week to buy $600 billion in Treasury debt
through next June, a move whose ramifications they don't fully
understand.
 Euphoria that was driven by expectations about the Fed's
plans had lifted the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 Index
about 16 percent over the past two months but has faded as
concerns mount about the action, known as quantitative easing.
 Some investors question whether the Fed might buy less than
the original amount of bonds, while others are concerned the
increased liquidity has propelled commodity prices higher,
which could induce a harmful bout of inflation.
 ""The initial liquidity rush of the last three months has
seemed to have reached its crescendo,"" said Chad Morganlander,
portfolio manager at Stifel Nicolaus & Co in Florham Park, New
Jersey. ""Investor sentiment around the actions of the Fed have
seem to have grown remorseful.""
 Fears about Ireland's high debt burden led investors in
Europe to seek shelter in German bunds, which also helped push
the euro lower against the dollar for a fourth straight day.
 Oil prices, meanwhile, rose above $87 per barrel after U.S
weekly oil data showed a surprise fall in crude inventories and
larger-than-expected drops in oil product stocks.
 European shares fell from two-year highs hit a day earlier
on concerns about euro zone debt problems and a sharp drop in
Natixis , which missed profit forecasts and helped
drag down banks.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
ended 0.7 percent lower at 1,109.61 points.
 ""Over the recent days and weeks, equity markets have
partially ignored the rising tensions within the euro zone and
today the focus is more on this after one of the clearing
companies increased the margin requirements for Irish bonds,""
said Tammo Greetfeld, equity strategist at UniCredit.
 The euro  fell 0.38 percent at $1.3724, while against
the yen, the dollar  rose 1.05 percent at 82.63.
 The dollar rose against major currencies, with the U.S.
Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.63 percent at 77.93.

1,211.52. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 0.34
points, or 0.01 percent, at 2,563.32.
 A decline in initial U.S. jobless claims had some analysts
suggesting the American economy was starting to gain traction
after months of sluggish growth. [ID:nN0986897]

payroll growth in October and an improved services sector.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a one-month
peak against the euro and yen on Wednesday as higher U.S. bond
yields prompted traders to cut bets against the greenback.
 Fear about Ireland's high debt burden left investors
seeking shelter in German bunds, which also helped push the
euro lower against the dollar for a fourth straight day.
 Strong U.S. economic data, including a decline in initial
jobless claims, even had some analysts suggesting the U.S.
economy was starting to gain traction after months of frustratingly
slow growth.
 Investors had sold dollars in recent months and bet that the
Federal Reserve plans to pump more money into the economy to boost
growth would drive already low U.S. rates even lower. So far, those
expectations have been frustrated.

world has had the same position on, we've got a lot of
end-of-the-year, risk management going on,"" said Sebastien
Galy, senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas.
 The euro fell as low as $1.3671 and was last changing hands at
$1.3720, down 0.4 percent. BNP Paribas said it could fall as far as
$1.3435 as it retraces a multi-month rally that peaked last month at
$1.4281, a 9-1/2-month high.
 The dollar climbed as high as 82.79 yen, up more than 1 percent,
as U.S. yields rose relative to Japanese ones. A close above 82.95
yen, the 55-day moving average, could signal a solid break out of the
pair's multi-month downward trend.
 The about-face has been evident across financial markets,
with stocks and commodities also retreating in recent days, and
this may signal that investors expect Fed policy to be
effective in boosting U.S. growth.
 ""I think, in some cases, at least, we might be seeing more
of a position reversal than simple profit-taking,"" said Shaun
Osborne, senior strategist at TD Securities in Toronto.
 Traders were awaiting a 30-year Treasury bond auction later
on Wednesday, with some expecting strong demand.
 FUNDING CURRENCY QUESTIONS
 Elsewhere, sterling rose 0.4 percent to $1.6075 after a Bank of
England inflation report made further monetary easing in the UK look
less likely. The euro fell 1 percent to 85.33 pence.
 The Australian dollar, a top performer this year, thanks to high
interest rates, commodity wealth and trade links with China, dipped
0.1 percent to $1.0023. Galy said it was unlikely to retest a recent
28-year high near $1.02 this year.
 The euro struggled after Portugal was forced to pay a
higher premium than previously at a bond auction and after
Ireland's central banker said Irish bond yields were at ""crisis
levels."" The gap between benchmark Irish and German bond yields
expanded to a euro lifetime high.
 Some analysts said the euro's losses would be limited, as the
European Central Bank has signaled plans to stick to a tighter
monetary policy than the Fed, which plans to pump more money into the
U.S. economy over the next eight months.
 ""Despite the correction we've been seeing, the euro's bull
trend is still in place,"" said John Hydeskov, senior currency
analyst at Danske Bank in Copenhagen.
 Osborne also noted that the Fed had yet to start its bond-
buying program, which could keep bond and currency markets
volatile in the coming months.
 But if U.S. yields keep rising and the U.S. economy shows
signs of improvement, Galy said investors may start using other
low-yielding currencies, such as the euro and yen instead of
the dollar, to finance more lucrative trades.
 ""The question is what the funding currency should be and
that's what investors are trying to figure out right now,"" he
said. 'It's still very early on and people are still very short
dollars, but we expect some shakeouts in the euro crosses.""

387,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2010 11:32AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Foreign companies stepping away from Iran," Nov 10 (Reuters) - Iran's day-to-day business is affected by
tighter international, U.S. and European Union sanctions imposed
in response to Western fears the country's nuclear activities
are aimed at developing bombs. Tehran says it has no such aim.
 Following are key facts on some firms that have been moving
away from Iran and on others still dealing with the country: 
 
 MOVING AWAY FROM IRAN:
 * Britain's North Sea Rhum gas field, in which the Iranian
Oil Company Limited has a 50 percent interest, is shutting down
due to EU sanctions on Iran, operator BP said on Wednesday.. 
 * United Arab Emirates-based oil and gas explorer Dragon
Oil's has not renewed an oil swap agreement with Iran which
expired in July 2010. Under the deal, Dragon used to ship the
crude it produces from its offshore development in Turkmenistan
to Iran's Bandar Neka, a port in the Caspian Sea, in return for
oil from southern Iran.
 -- The company said on Oct. 20 that it was currently
exporting all of its entitlement barrels of Turkmen crude using
the ""Western Route"", which is through Baku, Azerbaijan.
 * France's Total said it has halted all its trade in oil
products with Iran in compliance with a European embargo, after
initially resisting pressure from the United States to stop
doing business with Iran.
 -- Prior to that in early October the company said it was
still buying Iranian crude.
 * Traders said Royal Dutch Shell was still involved in
Iranian crude purchases while the company said in early October
that it was not illegal to lift oil from Iran. But it was not
renewing contracts to supply Iran Air with fuel, an industry
source said in July.
 * Norway's Statoil said it was providing Tehran with
technical assistance while Italy's ENI said it would exit Iran
only when existing deals expire.
 * ThyssenKrupp, Germany's biggest steelmaker, said on Sept.
23 it would not enter into new contracts with Iran and would
terminate existing contracts in support of the sanctions
policies of Germany, the EU and the U.S.
 * Turkish refiner Tupras told the U.S. State Department in
August that it had cancelled contracts to supply Iran with
gasoline and data showed in September there were no deliveries
in August.
 * BP confirmed in July it had stopped supplying jet fuel to

 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Stalled trade negotiations
between the European Union and African states have soured
relations between the two continents, the European Union's chief
trade negotiator said on Wednesday.
 Regional groupings of African, Caribbean and Pacific states
have resisted signing trade agreements with the EU despite years
of negotiations, frustrated by EU demands to cut tariffs and by
the wealth of EU commercial regulation.
 That has allowed China, India and Brazil to move in and
secure access to bountiful African resources and markets.
 ""It is true that this can be souring the relations between
Europe and Africa,"" European Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht
told Reuters in an interview.
 To break the deadlock Europe may scale back calls for free
trade in banking and other services sectors, and drop demands
that African, Caribbean and Pacific states quickly adopt
European rules on competition and the environment.
 ""On services we can be flexible. I think also on rules we
can have a progressive approach,"" he said, adding that any deal
would have to create greater volumes of trade to abide by global
trade rules.
 
 FIRST DEAL?
 Europe may yet clinch a first Africa trade deal in the
coming months, De Gucht said, an agreement with the Southern
African grouping of Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia,
Mozambique, Swaziland and South Africa.
 Another hindrance to better EU-Africa relations is Europe's
insistence on African guarantees of good governance and human
rights, he said. China, which makes no such demands, has made
rapid in-roads in signing trade deals with African states.
 ""The Chinese come with a check-book and they buy what they
need and we do all this in institutional frameworks and
institution-building,"" De Gucht said. ""I think it's the right
way to do it but it doesn't make our life easier.""
 Yet Europe should not back down on its governance demands,
De Gucht said.
 ""We have to continue insisting on governance in Africa,
because without governance you will not have growth,"" he said.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a one-month
high against the euro and yen on Wednesday as higher U.S. bond
yields prompted traders to cut extended bets against the
greenback.
 The euro fell below $1.37, its fourth straight daily
decline, with traders chalking up some weakness to fear about
the ability of some euro zone countries to finance deficits.
 Also, more strong U.S. economic data, including a decline
in initial jobless claims, had some analysts suggesting the
U.S. economy was starting to gain traction after months of
frustratingly slow growth.
 Data last week showed surprisingly strong U.S. payroll
growth in October and improvement in the services sector.
 Investors had been dollar sellers in recent months and bet
that Federal Reserve plans to pump more money into the economy
to boost growth would drive already low U.S. rates even lower.
So far, those expectations have been frustrated.
 ""The U.S. yield curve has steepened, and since the whole
world has had the same position on, we've got a lot of
end-of-the-year, risk management going on,"" said Sebastien
Galy, senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas.
 He said the euro, which hit a 9-1/2-month high near $1.43
last week, had probably peaked for the year and that the
Australian dollar also would fail this year to retest last
week's 28-year high of $1.0183. The Australian dollar was last
down 0.2 percent at $1.0005.
 The dollar was up 0.6 percent at 82.28 yen, near a
one-month high of 82.65 yen. The dollar/yen exchange rate is
particularly sensitive to movements in the difference between
U.S. and Japanese bond yields. The dollar's rise accelerated
after it triggered automatic stop-loss orders around 82 yen.
 Traders were awaiting a 30-year Treasury bond auction later
on Wednesday, with some expecting strong demand.
 The euro was down 0.6 percent to $1.3694, near the day's
$1.3671 low. Sterling rose 0.4 percent to $1.6041 after a Bank
of England inflation report made further monetary easing in the
UK look less likely. The euro fell 1 percent to 85.33 pence.
 FUNDING CURRENCY QUESTIONS
 An auction of Portuguese government bonds, at which
borrowing costs rose compared with a previous auction, weighed
on the euro.
 Debt worries in Portugal, Ireland and elsewhere have hurt
the euro. The gap between benchmark Irish and German bond
yields expanded to a euro lifetime high.
 Some analysts said euro losses would be limited, as the
European Central Bank has signaled plans to stick to a tighter
monetary policy than the Fed, which plans to pump more money
into the U.S. economy over the next eight months.
 ""Despite the correction we've been seeing, the euro's bull
trend is still in place,"" said John Hydeskov, senior currency
analyst at Danske Bank in Copenhagen.
 BNP's Galy said he expects investor demand for
higher-yielding, higher-risk assets to resume next year but
said the euro would likely struggle for the rest of 2010.
 If U.S. yields keep rising and the U.S. economy shows signs
of improvement, he said investors may start using other
low-yielding currencies, such as the euro and yen instead of
the dollar, to finance more lucrative trades.
 ""The question is what the funding currency should be and
that's what investors are trying to figure out right now,"" he
said. 'It's still very early on and people are still very short
dollars, but we expect some shakeouts in the euro crosses.""

 * Imports up 1.2 pct, highest since Nov 2008
(Adds link to graphic)
 By John McCrank
 OTTAWA, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Canada's trade deficit widened
more than expected in September as exports to the United States
tumbled to their lowest level in almost a year, signaling a
further drag on an already uncertain economic recovery.
 Exports to the United States, Canada's biggest trading
partner by far, fell 3.6 percent, hitting their lowest level
since November 2009. The decline was largely due to lower
vehicle shipments, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday.
 An increase in exports to other countries was not enough to
offset that decline, which contributed to a higher overall
trade deficit of C$2.49 billion ($2.49 billion), up from a
revised C$1.49 billion gap in August. The market had forecast a
C$1.55 billion shortfall.
 The September number came surprisingly close to the record
trade deficit of of C$2.74 billion, set in July on anemic U.S.
demand.
 
 Canada trade graphic http://r.reuters.com/vyx74q
 
 A slowdown in the export sector this year due to weak U.S.
demand and a strong Canadian dollar has fueled fears that
Canada's economic recovery could stall.
 ""It is some cause for concern, because what we're seeing
here is underlying weakness in exports,"" said Doug Porter,
deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. ""If the
deterioration was largely due to a big run-up in imports, then
I don't think it would be all that much of a concern.""
 Overall exports were down 1.7 percent in September to
C$33.07 billion, below analysts' forecast of C$33.98 billion.
Automotive products, other consumer goods, as well as
industrial goods and materials, led the decline.
 The September numbers meant that export volumes were down
for the third quarter, which is the first quarterly decline in
over a year, since the economic recovery began, said Porter.
 One positive from the report was that industrial goods and
materials, and machinery, the two largest import sectors,
recorded gains in September, said Eric Lascelles, chief Canada
macrostrategist at TD Securities.
 ""The gain in imports does suggest that businesses are
finally getting off the couch and starting to invest in
machines and equipment and other productivity-enhancing
things,"" Lascelles said.
 ""Basically the bigger trade deficit gets offset by more
business investment so you don't quite end up at scratch, but
you're not too far under water.""
 Overall imports rose by 1.2 percent to C$35.55 billion.
That was above forecasts for C$35.40 billion, and was the
highest level for imports since November 2008.
 Import prices rose 1.1 percent in the month.
 The Canadian dollar weakened before the report, but then
gained strength afterwards, largely ignoring the report as the
market focused on strong commodity prices, Lascelles said.
 BMO said the trade deficit would act as a drag on gross
domestic product growth in the third quarter and that it was
the main thing holding back Canada's economy from outperforming
the U.S. economy.
 Lascelles said that GDP for the quarter would still likely
come in at around 1.5 percent annualized growth, in line with
the Bank of Canada's 1.6 percent forecast.

 * EU trade chief wants interim rare earths deal with China

 BRUSSELS, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The EU trade chief said on
Wednesday he would press China for assurances on rare earth
supplies in talks next month, though there was no conclusive
evidence Chinese limits on such exports had hit European
industry.
 The European Union is struggling to secure supplies of rare
earth minerals, which are used in the production of high-tech
goods and defence products, and has said it could take legal
action against China for cutting down on exports.
 ""If need be, we will certainly go to the WTO but ... up to
now there is no conclusive evidence that our European businesses
are hampered by this,"" European Trade Commissioner Karel De
Gucht told Reuters in an interview.
 ""It's better to come to a negotiated agreement whereby the
interim is covered by clear arrangements ... instead of getting
into a fight.""
 
 SUBSIDIES
 De Gucht said Europe was paying close attention to Chinese
state subsidies as the EU looks for new ways of deal with cheap
imports that hurt its producers. Chinese imports are set to boom
in 2016, when the EU recognises China as a market economy.
 ""We are focusing more and more on subsidisation ... They
subsidise nearly everything,"" he said. ""We are going to become
much more precise in reacting to that kind of practice.""
 But De Gucht rejected calls for an EU import tax on goods
made under less stringent environmental conditions than in the
EU, saying that would pose the risk of multiple legal suits.
 France and Germany have said a ""green"" border tax is
critical for securing the competitiveness of EU producers
burdened by environmental rules that add to their costs.
 ""I fear very much that (a border tax) could end up in a
trade war. I'm certainly not in favour of this,"" he said.
 The EU executive Commission has no current plans to draft
such a tariff, but might have to reconsider if other major
trading or economic blocs took such a step, De Gucht said.

 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth showed
more tentative signs of improving on Wednesday as jobless
benefit claims hit a four-month low last week and the
international trade gap narrowed in September.
 The reports followed last Friday's U.S. payrolls data
showing private sector job growth was the best for any month
since April, suggesting the economy may be beginning to pull
out of its summer doldrums.
 ""Two months ago, three months ago there was a real growth
scare and people were talking about a double dip (recession),""
said Jim O'Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global in New York.
""Now, the numbers are not only not showing double-dip, but
they're showing reacceleration.""
 The number of workers filing new claims for state
unemployment aid fell to 435,000 in the week ended Nov. 6 from
a revised 459,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said.
Economists had looked for claims to come in at 450,000.
 The bigger-than-expected drop took a four-week moving
average of claims, a better indicator of underlying trends, to
its lowest level since just before Lehman Brothers filed for
bankruptcy in September 2008.
 At the same time, the number of people still receiving
regular state benefits after an initial week of aid fell to 4.3
million in the week ended Oct. 30, the lowest level since
November 2008.
 Still, analysts say the pace of job creation is not enough
to pull down the United State's 9.6 percent unemployment rate.
 Concern over the anemic job market was a factor behind the
Federal Reserve's decision last week to pump an extra $600
billion into the U.S. economy through Treasury bond purchases.
 Late Wednesday leading technology company Cisco Systems Inc
 reported a 19 percent jump in quarterly revenue, as
more businesses upgraded their netorks to handle growing
Internet traffic in another sign of a recovering

 CHINA IMPORTS STILL NEAR RECORD
 In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the U.S.
trade deficit narrowed more than expected in September to $44.O
billion, despite near record imports from China.
 A narrower trade deficit is positive for U.S. economic
growth since it suggests more demand for U.S. production.
 Financial markets, however, largely shrugged off the data.
Worries over Ireland's debt load helped push the U.S. dollar to
one-month high against the euro and the yen early, and stocks
ended little changed, as did U.S. Treasury yields.
 Economists said the internatioanl trade report suggested
the U.S. economy grew a bit more swiftly in the third quarter
than the 2.0 percent annual pace reported late last month.
 Many also said the trade deficit, which cut into growth
last quarter, could be a positive in the final three months of
the year. O'Sullivan said the drop in jobless claims suggests
growth could pick up to 3.0 percent as the year draws to a
close.
 U.S. exports rose slightly in September, a third
consecutive monthly gain. Imports fell 1.0 percent.
 The rise in exports and decline in imports suggests a drop
in the value of the U.S. dollar ""might be beginning to weave
its magic,"" said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh
Johnson Advisors in Albany, New York.
 A weaker dollar helps U.S. exporters by making American
products cheaper in world markets, at the same time increasing
the cost of foreign goods in the United States.
 But continued high imports from China cast a shadow over
the data. U.S imports from China totaled $35.0 billion, just
barely below a record set in August, while U.S exports to the
country declined fractionally to $7.2 billion.
 The resulting $27.8 billion trade deficit with China, by
far the largest the United States had with any trade partner,
could revive chances for the Senate to vote on legislation
punishing some Chinese imports for Beijing's currency
practices.
 The House of Representatives approved the bill in September
in the belief that China deliberately undervalues its currency
to give Chinese companies an unfair trade advantage.
 While many observers believe the bill will fall by the
wayside following the Nov. 2 congressional elections, some
think its fate depends on whether President Barack Obama can
make progress on the issue at a Group of 20 summit that gets
underway in Seoul on Thursday.
 The U.S. trade gap with China has swelled to $201.2 billion
in the first nine months of 2010, compared to $165.9 billion in
the same period in 2009.
 Washington is pushing Beijing to let its currency rise more
quickly in value and take other steps to spur domestic demand.
On Wednesday, China ordered its banks to put more money aside
as required reserves, a move that could slow Chinese growth.

397,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2010 09:08AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-BoE's King urges G20 cooperation on imbalances," (Adds details, quotes)
 LONDON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The world's leading economies
must this weekend agree on a way to redress current account
imbalances and stop bickering about individual countries' policy
choices, Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said on Wednesday.
 Leaders from the Group of 20 advanced and emerging economies
will this weekend try to hammer out an agreement about the best
way to promote stability in the global economy.
 Some countries have criticised the United States for
embarking on a second wave of quantitative easing, a move they
say creates problems by weakening the dollar, while the U.S. has
kept up a barrage of criticism against China's fixed currency.
 King urged leaders to focus on the broader aim of agreeing
on a way to rebalance their economies.
 ""It is very important that the fundamental point that is
recognised at the weekend -- not decisions on instruments or
exchange rates or targets for current account balances in terms
of a number -- but that there is a path along which the current
account imbalances unwind,"" he said.
 ""I hope that at the G20 meeting this weekend that we will
get a co-operative message rather than some of those that we
have been getting in the last few days and weeks.""
 A U.S. proposal to set a numerical target for nations'
current account balances failed to garner much support at last
month's meeting of G20 finance ministers in South Korea.
 King said there needed to be a genuine recognition that
unwinding current account imbalances was in the collective
interest.
 ""Unless we recognize that and reach agreement on what that
path is going to look like -- not numerically this weekend but
over the next 6-9 months -- then we will face a situation where
more and more countries will resort to policy instruments that
in the end will be damaging to everyone. It is that serious.""
 King said criticism of the Fed's decision to expand its
quantitative easing programme was ill-judged. Some countries
have accused the Fed of exacerbating imbalances in capital flows
with its latest round of easing as investors pour their money
into emerging markets offering higher yields.
 ""I think it's rather baffling some of the comments that have
been made, and it's rather difficult to attach much economic
sense to it,"" King said.
 ""The concern that the United States has expressed, with some
justification, is that they have never intervened to prevent the
exchange rate responding the way the markets thought was
appropriate given its domestic policy.
 ""There's a world of difference between deliberately
intervening to lower or raise the exchange rate, or setting
domestic policy and then letting the market determine the
exchange rate,"" he added.

398,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2010 09:04AM ET</span>",MIDEAST MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-UAE markets downbeat on property woes," * Mideast markets seen following divergent paths
 * Egypt stock market already priced in Nov. 28 poll jitters
 
 By Matt Smith
 DUBAI, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Markets in the United Arab
Emirates are seen underperforming regional and global peers next
week as downbeat earnings suggest the troubles dogging the
country's once-mighty property sector are far from over.
 The Saudi and Kuwaiti bourses are expected to be shut all
week for the Eid al-Adha holiday, celebrating the end of the
Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca. The exact timing of the holiday will
depend on the sighting of the moon.
 Other bourses will also have a shortened trading week,
spurring traders to book profits ahead of the vacation.
 Dubai's index was down 5.4 percent year-to-date to Nov. 10,
making it the worst performing Gulf Arab benchmark in 2010 after
a slew of disappointing earnings wiped out some of a rally that
lasted through September and October.
 Builder Arabtec's quarterly profit fell 96 percent, while
property earnings have also come in below estimates, pointing to
further weakness in the real estate and construction sector,
which dominates both the Dubai and Abu Dhabi bourses. 
 ""If global investors want to play the global cyclical trade,
it doesn't really exist in UAE markets,"" Robert McKinnon, ASAS
Capital chief investment officer, said.
 ""The UAE economy is actually doing quite well -- hotel
reservations are up, Emirates airlines posted strong results,
for example -- but we can't invest in these companies and
there's a big disconnect between the stock market and the real
economy.""
 Dubai, home to three man-made palm islands and the world's
tallest building, was hit hardest when the UAE property market
crashed. Prices are down 58 percent from their 2008 peaks and
further declines of 11 percent are forecast because of
oversupply and limited liquidity as more projects that broke
ground at the top of the boom are only just being completed.
 But Abu Dhabi's developers are also struggling, in part
because of a contagion from Dubai, but also as a result of
over-leverage.
 Shares in Aldar Properties, the UAE capital's bellwether,
have tumbled ahead of an expected refinancing plan seen as
likely to dilute the stakes of minority shareholders. 
 Aldar has an estimated 14 billion dirhams ($3.81 billion) of
debts maturing next year, according to Egyptian investment bank
EFG-Hermes, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch this month
warned that Aldar needs 9.8 billion dirhams ($2.67 billion) by
2011 as it seeks funding to survive. 
 ""There's not a whole lot of downside and the market should
move sideways - I don't foresee a catalyst before the end of the
year for UAE markets,"" McKinnon added.
 
 REGIONAL DIVERGENCE
 Middle East markets are seen following increasingly
divergent paths between now and the end of the year. 
 ""Performance is likely to split into two halves -- Saudi
Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and Oman should outperform and attract
foreign investors, but Bahrain, the UAE and Kuwait will be
laggards because these markets lack the triggers to move to
higher levels,"" said Shakeel Sarwar, head of asset management at
Securities & Investment Co (SICO) in Bahrain.
 ""Saudi Arabia is a large liquid market, Qatar offers strong
economic growth and Egypt is a demographic play, so money will
flow into these markets because they have lower perceived risk
and higher potential returns.""
 
 EGYPT UPBEAT
 Egypt's equity market seems to have largely discounted
uncertainty linked to a Nov. 28 parliamentary election and a
presidential vote in 2011, analysts said.
 But volumes on the Egyptian exchange are still relatively
weak and investors are awaiting more clarity on central bank
interest rate policy before taking longer-term positions.
 ""It is safe to trade (equities), but not for 'buy and
hold',"" Lara Ahmed, a technical analyst at Prime Research, said.
 ""I expect we will have a short-term market bottom... and the
market will witness a new rally"" once interest rate risk
subsides.""
 Most analysts polled by Reuters have forecast a drop in
Egypt's annual inflation rate for October due to lower food
prices and favourable base effects. The figures are due for
release on Wednesday.
 The Egyptian pound fell to its lowest against the dollar
since June 2005 in early November but subsequently rebounded
after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would buy $600 billion of
government debt to spur the economy.
 Central Bank Deputy Governor Hisham Ramez denied intervening
to support the pound and said inflation was under control.
 The average yield on Egyptian 91-day treasury bills fell to
9.059 percent at an auction from 9.348 percent in late October.
 Prime's Ahmed suggested avoiding bank stocks such as CIB
and NSGB which seem overpriced.
 ""I think investors will go to more secure stocks that didn't
make a move above their medium-term highs yet,"" she said.
 Egypt's real estate sector may be buoyed by Amer Group,
which expects to raise 1.14 billion Egyptian pounds through an
initial public offering and a private placement before the end
of November.
 Palm Hills, Egypt's second biggest developer, posted sales
of 1.78 billion pounds ($312 million) on Monday, marking its
second consecutive quarter of strong growth and assuaging
worries about real estate firms' ability to book sales while
legal muddles over their land banks go through the courts.
 Telecom stocks will be in focus as Telecom Egypt reports
third-quarter results on Nov. 11.
 More clarity on a plan to merge most of Orascom Telecom
with Russian operator Vimpelcom could give new impetus to the
Egyptian market.
 The deal still looks uncertain as Algeria pushes ahead with
a plan to buy Orascom's lucrative unit Djezzy. Algeria has
demanded hundreds of millions of dollars from Orascom in
back-taxes and penalties.

399,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2010 09:04AM ET</span>","Geithner, Swan, Tharman see growth as main risk-WSJ"," SEOUL, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The main economic risk to the
world is the prospect of advanced economies underachieving on
growth, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and his
counterparts in Australia and Singapore said.
 In a joint opinion piece due for Thursday's edition of the
Wall Street Journal-Asia, Geithner, Australian Treasurer Wayne
Swan, and Singaporean Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam
said countries around the world must work to promote economic
expansion because global growth is still not strong enough.
 ""The main risk for the world is not inflation in the
advanced economies, where inflation expectations are stable at
relatively low levels, but that the advanced economies
underachieve on growth,"" the ministers wrote.
 ""Those economies must look for ways to strengthen underlying
foundations of long-term growth, including fostering innovation
and developing higher skills in the labour force, removing
impediments to market entry, and providing stronger incentives
for labour force participation.""
 The ministers endorsed agreements reached last month by
Group of 20 finance ministers to limit external imbalances and
to avoid competitive devaluation of currencies, key points being
negotiated for G20 leaders now gathering in Seoul.
 Geithner, Swan and Tharman said currencies of major advanced
economies -- widely viewed as the dollar, euro and yen -- were
""roughly in alignment with each other"".
 But they said emerging market countries ""need to allow their
exchange rates to reflect the substantial growth they have
achieved in their economies over the last decade and to respond
more flexibly to underlying market forces"".
 They said the framework for limiting external imbalances can
be a ""useful early warning system"" of economic trouble, but
should take into account differences between countries and
""practical realities"". Swan has said, for example, that
Australia is now running a current account deficit because of
strong foreign investment in its mining sector.
 Germany, which has a structurally high current account
surplus because of its export industries, is among a number of
countries opposed to numerical targets for current account
balances.
 The three ministers also called on the G20 to resist
protectionist pressures.
 ""We need to continue to keep our markets open and work to
expand trade and maintain a level playing field across
countries. Growth in the emerging economies still depends on
access to products and services of the advanced economies.""
 Geithner met Tharman and Singapore's prime minister, Lee
Hsien Loong, on Wednesday in Singapore before travelling to
Seoul for the G20 summit. He also met local financial industry
executives and the city-state's two sovereign wealth funds.

400,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2010 09:00AM ET</span>",UPDATE 3-BoE seen on hold after Nov inflation forecasts," * Inflation seen undershooting target, big risks both ways
 * BoE leaves door open to more QE, but also ready to tighten
 * Inflation Report does little to settle debate over policy
 
 (Recasts, adds context)
 By Sumeet Desai and Matt Falloon
 LONDON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The Bank of England looks set to
keep monetary policy on hold for some time to come after its
latest forecasts on Wednesday highlighted an uncertain outlook
for the economy and a wide range of views among policymakers.
 Sterling rose sharply and British government bond futures
dropped, suggesting investors think it is now less likely
Britain's central bank will join the U.S. Federal Reserve in
injecting more stimulus into the economy.
 The BoE's quarterly Inflation Report did leave the door open
to more quantitative easing -- buying assets with newly-created
money -- if needed, but Governor Mervyn King said policymakers
stood ready to act in either direction.
 King stressed big upside and downside risks to both
inflation and growth and said the fate of Britain's recovery
would rely heavily on the strength of the global economy.
 ""We cannot be sure which of the big risks to the outlook
will materialise,"" King told reporters.
 ""Given the scale of the fall during the recession, the level
of output is likely to remain weak.""
 Britain's economy has rebounded strongly from an 18-month
recession, posting its strongest six-month period of growth for
a decade in the middle of this year. But government spending
cuts and tax rises are expected to weigh on activity next year.
 Meanwhile, inflation has remained higher this year than the
BoE anticipated.
 The BoE expects inflation to remain above its two percent
target next year before falling sharply to stand below target in
two years -- the horizon on which the central bank sets policy.
 Growth is seen slowing in 2011 but then picking up to just
over 3 percent in two years' time.
 
 VIGOROUS DEBATE
 King said there was ""vigorous debate"" and a wider than usual
range of views over the risks to inflation and growth among
Monetary Policy Committee members.
 That range of views, expressed in the broad spectrum of
outcomes the central bank has factored in for the next two
years, makes it more likely that policy will remain on hold
until the economic outlook becomes clearer.
 ""The committee is still relaxed over the inflation outlook
but is not sufficiently concerned over economic prospects to
sanction a further round of QE"", said Philip Shaw, chief
economist at Investec.
 The BoE's inflation forecast -- around 1.6 percent in two
years if interest rates creep up as markets expect -- was a
touch higher than August's projection. The near-term profile was
also higher due to a VAT tax rise and increased import costs.
 ""As the impact of those factors on inflation diminishes,
inflation is likely to fall back, reflecting continued downward
pressure from the persistent margin of spare capacity,"" the BoE
said in its report.
 ""But the timing and extent of that decline in inflation are
highly uncertain.""
 Minutes of the BoE's last meeting -- when it kept interest
rates at a record low of 0.5 percent and froze its 200 billion
pound QE plan -- will be published next Wednesday and could give
a better idea of where the MPC's policy bias lies.
 Policymakers were split three ways in October, with one
voting for higher rates, one arguing for more QE and the
remaining seven favouring keeping policy on hold.

402,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2010 08:36AM ET</span>",US trade gap narrows more than expected in Sept," WASHINGTON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. trade defict
narrowed more than expected in September, despite near record
imports from China, as a weak U.S. dollar helped American
exports grow for the third consecutive month, a U.S. government
report showed on Wednesday.
 The monthly trade gap totaled $44.0 billion, down from a
revised estimate of $46.5 billion in August. Wall Street
analysts had expected the deficit to narrow to about $45.5
billion.
 U.S. exports rose a bare 0.3 percent to $154.1 billion.
But that still was the highest since the depths of the
financial crisis in August 2008, and included record services
exports of $46.5 billion.
 President Barack Obama, who is on a trip to Asia intended
partly to boost U.S. trade, has set a goal of doubling exports
over the next five years to create millions of jobs.
 With Obama and Congress under pressure to cut spending and
the huge budget deficit, many experts see trade as one area
where the federal government can help foster economic growth.
 U.S. imports, in a sign consumers and businesses are
cutting back on their purchases, fell 1.0 percent in September
to $198.1 billion.
 But imports of advanced technology products set a record,
as did the U.S. trade deficit in that key trade sector ,
raising concern the United States is losing its edge in
industries such as computers and telecommunications, nuclear
energy, life sciences and biotechnology.
 U.S imports from China totaled $35.0 billion, just barely
below a record set in August, while U.S exports to the country
declined fractionally to $7.2 billion.
The resulting $27.8 billion trade deficit with China, by far
the largest the United States had with any trade partner, could
revive chances for the Senate to vote on legislation punishing
some Chinese imports for Beijing's currency practices.
 The House of Representatives approved that bill in
September in the belief that China deliberately undervalues
its currency to give Chinese companies an unfair trade
advantage.
Many observers believe the bill could fall by the wayside
following the Nov. 2 congressional election in which Democrats
lost control of the House. But some think its fate depends on
whether Obama can make progress with the Chinese on the issue
at this week's Group of 20 summit in Seoul. 
In the first 9 months of the year, the trade deficit with
China has swelled to $201.2 billion, compared to $165.9 billion
in the same period in 2009, reviving concerns that huge global
imbalances blamed for the global financial crisis are
reemerging.
 The U.S. trade deficit was $379.1 billion in the first nine
months of this year, compared to $270.2 billion in the same
period in 2009, putting it on a path to exceed $500 billion in
2010.

 By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent
 LONDON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Former British finance minister
Alistair Darling says it took a sense of alarm bordering on
panic and the leadership of several figures to produce success
at last year's London G20 meeting -- and he sees little evidence
of enough of either this weekend in Seoul.
 Together with then-Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown,
Darling was one of the main figures at the London meeting of the
Group of 20 nations which was credited with helping to restore
confidence on global financial markets.
 In April 2009, G20 leaders agreed a $1.1 trillion package to
help pull the global economy out of its deep slump. But Darling
says national leaders lost their sense of purpose after the
meeting fixed their attention again on domestic priorities and
allowed divisions between them to grow.
 ""I think people left the table too early,"" Darling told
Reuters in an interview in his parliamentary office overlooking
the River Thames. ""It would be a pity if we had to wait for
another calamity or near calamity to get everyone sitting
properly around the table again.""
 Divisions have widened before this weekend's meeting of G20
leaders in South Korea primarily over currency valuations. The
United States is accusing China of preventing its yuan currency
from appreciating, and Beijing is accusing Washington of
weakening the dollar through the quantitative easing policy.
 ""What makes these summits work is that you really need two
or three people to do the heavy lifting,"" Darling said. ""If
Gordon (Brown) had not done what he did in pushing people
together in the same room it wouldn't have happened. If you
don't have the (U.S.) president, it's not going to work. 
 ""The Chinese leadership has to be prepared to make it work.
That's when domestic politics come in. If you look at this
coming weekend, there's no sense of common purpose.""
 What helped during the financial crisis of 2008-9 was alarm
across all major economies and the fear they would sink or swim
together, he said. Divisions emerged when the immediate crisis
was seen to have passed.
 
 LOOKING BEYOND BACKYARD
 Analysts say China is worried that job creation will be hit
at home if it allows the yuan to rise, raising the risk of
unrest. In the United States, President Barack Obama's
Democratic party was hammered in mid-term elections last week
and he faces a punishing 2012 presidential race. 
 Darling, who lost office with Brown in May's British general
election and has now stepped back from frontbench politics, said
leaders had to move beyond simply focusing on what their
domestic constituencies wanted to hear.
 ""People are focused on what happens when they go back to
their own countries,"" he said, adding that they needed ""to
focus on the fact that yes, there is a bigger prize here"".
 Consequences of sustained disagreement could be brutal, he
said, ultimately damaging everyone. ""It is very tempting for
governments to say it is the fault of someone outside and put up
more barriers and I think that would be a disaster.""
 Darling said he was already sceptical about the new British
coalition government's economic growth targets due to its
public sector spending cuts, but a trade war would mean there
was not ""a cat's chance in hell"" they could be met.
 France has signalled it hopes to put new energy behind a
currency deal when it takes over G20 presidency next year. Like
Brown and Darling in 2008, French President Nicolas Sarkozy is
likely to hope for domestic political gain if he is seen to seal
a deal before a tough re-election battle in 2012.
 ""I don't necessarily care what it takes to get someone to
rally the troops,"" said Darling. ""Sarkozy has said he wants to
get agreement and that is good. But it takes more than just one
person to get a deal.""

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The euro lost ground against the
dollar on Wednesday, dragged lower by losses versus sterling,
which rose after a Bank of England inflation report made further
monetary easing in the UK look less likely.
 The dollar was broadly firmer, rallying to a one-month high
versus the yen, supported by higher U.S. bond yields.
 ""The dollar has some support from higher bond yields and
that is most clearly obvious in dollar/yen,"" said Jane Foley,
currency strategist at Rabobank.
 ""In euro/dollar we are seeing what is coming out in the wash
from moves elsewhere, with clear moves in sterling and
dollar/yen, while the peripheral euro zone story is still a
negative for the euro.""
 Traders said an auction of Portuguese government bonds, at
which borrowing costs rose compared with a previous auction,
weighed on the euro. [ID:nLIS002504]
 The dollar sailed higher versus the yen -- which is
particularly sensitive to movements in the difference between
U.S. and Japanese bond yields -- after stop-loss orders were
triggered, pushing the U.S. currency above 82.00 yen.
 The euro  was down 0.2 percent at $1.3754, edging
closer to the day's low around $1.3732 hit in earlier trade.
Support was seen at that level, last touched in late October.
 Foley said the euro was likely to stay in a range versus the
dollar, which would stay vulnerable to selling pressure after
the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision last week to restart
quantitative easing.
 The euro's losses and gains in dollar/yen helped prod the
dollar higher versus a currency basket <.DXY>. It climbed 0.7
percent to around 82.37 yen .
 The dollar gained after longer-dated U.S. Treasury bond
yields jumped on Tuesday, with the market watching for an
auction of 30-year debt later on Wednesday.

 STERLING GAINS
 The euro hit a six-week low versus sterling 
after the BoE said near-term inflation would pick up further.

around 1.6 percent in two years, lower than its 2 percent
target, it said there was a wider than usual range of views over
the risks to growth and inflation among its policymakers.
 ""The euro move is being driven by euro/sterling selling
following the slightly hawkish BoE inflation report,"" a currency
trader in London said.
 Sterling  climbed 0.6 percent on the day to $1.6079.
 The euro has retreated from a 9 1/2-month high touched last
week versus the dollar as concerns have resurfaced about debt
problems facing euro zone members Ireland and Portugal, seen as
possible candidates for a Greek-style bail-out.

(Adds analysts, updates markets)
 By Walter Gibbs
 OSLO, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Norwegian inflation undershot
expectations on Wednesday, giving the country's central bank
more leeway to encourage a faster economic recovery by keeping
interest rates lower for longer.
 Consumer prices rose 1.0 percent year on year in October,
the country's statistics agency said, up from 0.9 percent in
September but shy of a 1.1 percent average forecast from 13
analysts in a Reuters poll.
 The Norwegian central bank had projected 1.2 percent.
 ""Once again inflation surprises on the downside,"" said Ida
Bache, senior economist at Handelsbanken.
 ""If inflation continues to come in below the central bank's
forecast this will be an argument for a further lowering of the
interest rate path.""
 Norges Bank said last month interest rates would likely stay
at 2.0 percent until next summer, a half year longer than
previously thought, partly due to benign inflation.
 Its long-term inflation target is 2.5 percent.
 Norway's economy suffered only a mild recession last year
amid the global downturn, with GDP contracting by 1.5 percent in
2009, but it has emerged from the slump more slowly than its
Nordic neighbours.
 The country's non-oil economy grew by 0.5 percent in the
second quarter of 2010, confirming central bank projections of a
gradual pick-up in domestic growth.
 The Norwegian crown weakened to 8.0715 against the euro at
0925 GMT versus 8.0568 ahead of the inflation data, before
partly recovering to trade at 8.0660 by 1212 GMT.
 ""This is only one figure, but it comes in the wake
of several months of surprisingly weak inflation, so it
confirms that the trend is weaker than Norges Bank believes,""
said Kjersti Haugland, senior economist at DnB NOR Markets.
 ""If this lasts, it will delay the interest rate hike
decision even further,"" said Erik Bruce, chief economist at
Nordea Markets.
 He said several lower-than-expected inflation reports have
kept Norges Bank from raising rates as aggressively as intended
when it began lifting them from a post-crisis low of 1.25
percent in October 2009.
 ""It seems like it's the prices of imported consumer goods
that surprised the central bank,"" Bache said.
 ""The recent numbers we have for manufacturing output and
retail sales seem to confirm that activity in the real Norwegian
economy seems to be picking up in line with expectations.""
 In October, electricity prices rose 1.6 percent against the
preceding month, and were a main reason behind the monthly
increase in the CPI, Statistics Norway said.

States agreed on the need to address the problem of relying too
much on a single country for production and supply of rare
earths, a Japanese government official said on Wednesday.
 Japanese Trade Minister Akihiro Ohata and U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State James Steinberg, meeting on the sidelines of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ministerial meeting in
Japan, also sought cooperation on rare earth recycling and
developing alternative materials, the official said.
 China, which accounts for 97 percent of global output of the
elements used in high-tech devices, windmills, batteries and some
weaponry, strictly controls their trade, despite pressure from
the United States and Japan to loosen export constraints.
 ""In the medium and long-term ... based on the shared
recognition on the issue of overly lop-sided production and
supply (of rare earths) by one country, there were exchanges on
cooperating on possible measures such as developing alternative
materials and recycling,"" the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, told reporters after Ohata and Steinberg met.
 Chinese customs officials have imposed broad shipment
restrictions on rare earth exports to Japan after Japan detained
a Chinese fishing boat captain whose trawler collided with
Japanese patrol boats near disputed islands in the East China Sea
in September. He was later released and sent home.
 The incident followed China's announcement in July that it
would slash export quotas for rare earths by 40 percent.
 Washington has called restrictions on the minerals a
potential threat to the U.S. economy and national security.
 Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan and President Barack Obama
will meet on Saturday on the sidelines of the APEC summit in
Yokohama, just south of Tokyo.
 Canada's trade minister told Reuters China's approach to
supplying rare earth minerals to the world was troubling but
presented an opportunity for resource-rich Canada to step up to
the plate.
 ""Everybody is concerned about supply of rare earths,""
Peter Van Loan told Reuters on Wednesday on the sidelines of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting. ""The approach
of the Chinese is troubling because it is not a market approach
that they've adopted.""
 ""For a country like Canada, we do think this represents a
long-term opportunity. We're a country rich in resources
including rare earths, and I expect and hope that we'll be able
to take some steps in the long term and medium term to
meet some of those market needs,"" he said in an interview.

414,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2010 06:52AM ET</span>",China faces challenge implementing food safety -FDA," SHANGHAI, Nov 10 (Reuters) - China's implementation of food
safety standards is the country's biggest hindrance in
exporting high quality, trusted food products overseas, an
official with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on
Wednesday.
 The Chinese government has made great strides in addressing
food safety issues after a series of problems including a
tainted milk powder scandal in 2008, FDA Deputy Commissioner
for Foods Michael Taylor told reporters in Shanghai.
 ""It is a challenge to implement because we have to develop
the expertise, the training of the inspectors and common
approaches to inspection,"" Taylor said.
 China set up a national food safety commission in February,
headed by Vice Premier Li Keqiang, after tainted milk powder in
2008 sickened thousands of babies and destroyed the credibility
of the country's dairy industry.
 Food products from China, including dairy and seafood, are
categorised with import alert systems on entry to the United
States to ensure that products meet safety requirements. Taylor
said it was hard to say the percentage of products that did not
meet U.S. safety standards, but reiterated that Chinese
officials were investing heavily to improve their regulatory
system.
 ""An important development is the new food safety law that
was passed here in 2009 with a very high-level food safety
committee. It just shows a forthright approach to making food
safety an important priority, to creating more transparency in
the food safety system,"" he said.
 Globally, the ""made in China"" brand continues to be under
close scrutiny due to the persistence of food and product
safety breaches that have alarmed consumers and sparked
criminal cases leading, in some cases, to executions.
 ""The brand is in the eye of the beholder. The Chinese
government is making serious efforts and moving in the right
direction, so I think ultimately consumers will make that
decision, but we are optimistic about the future of our
partnership with China,"" Taylor said.

 By Peter Dinkloh and Tom Kaeckenhoff
 DUESSELDORF, Germany, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Germany's E.ON, the
world's largest utility, reassured investors by promising
minimum dividends for two years, offering confidence in an
industry unsettled by slumping prices and demand.
 The triple whammy of lower industrial production, declining
power and gas prices as well as prospects of higher taxes in
markets such as Germany has made the utility sector the
worst-performing in Europe for the second year in a row.
 E.ON is seeking to counteract that trend and said on
Wednesday its dividend for 2011 would drop no more than 13
percent to 1.30 euros ($1.79) a share, and its 2012 payout would
remain at that level.
 ""As prospects for E.ON's operating business are weak the
dividend was the last hope"" for investors, said Equinet analyst
Michael Schäfer.
 E.ON shares rose 4.15 percent to 23.10 euros at 1139 GMT,
outperforming the STOXX Europe 600 utilities index, which was up
1.2 percent.
 The company also plans to give more weight to markets
outside Europe, a strategy that has helped competitors such as
GDF Suez and Enel, and to expand into two new regions.
 While E.ON has not yet decided which markets to target, a
person with knowledge of the matter had told Reuters on Tuesday
that south-eastern Asia was one of the regions E.ON was
considering entering.
 ""We are analysing which markets we'll target and will decide
that soon,"" said a spokesman on Wednesday, declining to be more
specific.
 The company's record outside Europe has been mixed: It sold
PG & E, a utility it owned in the United States, for $6.7
billion while keeping its windmills in the country. In Russia,
it spent more than 4 billion euros to buy power producer OGK-4.
 E.ON also plans to sell 15 billion euros in assets by 2013.
 That strategy ""isn't going to prove easy,"" Kepler's Becker
said. ""The execution risk in both disposals and acquisitions is
high.""

 * Copper down on Chinese imports data; oil drifts lower
 * World stocks fall; dollar hits a two-week high
 * Irish spreads hit a euro lifetime high
 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - World stocks and copper prices
fell on Wednesday on concerns about softening demand from China
after slower-than-expected import data, while the dollar
recovered further and hit its highest level in two weeks.
Borrowing costs for Ireland rose to a euro lifetime high
after a clearing house raised margin requirements for Irish
debt, highlighting nervousness about the country, which is
struggling to pass the first of four austerity budgets next
month.
 Data showed Chinese October import growth was slower than
expected, indicating softening domestic demand.
 China, a major engine of global growth, has also raised
required reserves for its biggest banks to mop up some of the
cash that is streaming into the country and posing a growing
inflationary threat, following a fresh round of money-printing
by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
 The move fuelled worries that Chinese authorities may
further try to cool economic expansion.
 ""Growth in China imports has slowed down, that will be a bit
of a concern for the market,"" Heino Ruland, strategist at Ruland
Research in Frankfurt, said. ""But earnings have been better than
expected and any dip could be a buying opportunity.""
 Stock markets in Hong Kong and China fell, while world
equities measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index lost 0.5
percent.
 Japan's Nikkei average rose 1.4 percent to its highest close
in more than four months, buoyed by financial shares, with
Mizuho Financial up 7.6 percent, after a report that most major
Asian banks may be exempt from planned new global rules.
 However, people close to the G20's taskforce on financial
regulation said global regulators have yet to draw up lists of
banks judged ""too big to fail"".
 U.S. stock index futures were down 0.05 to up 0.1 percent,
indicating a steady open on Wall Street, ahead of weekly jobless
claims data.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 dropped 0.3 percent, led by
commodity stocks after China's copper imports fell to their
lowest level for a year and oil shipments were down 30 percent.
Copper fell 1.3 percent, while gold rose 0.8 percent though
off its record high hit in the previous session.
 Oil eased 0.2 percent to trade below $87 a barrel after
hitting a two-year high on Tuesday.
 
 DOLLAR BOUNCE
 The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a
basket of major currencies, rose 0.4 percent, recovering from a
11-month low last week.
 The correlation between Europe's broad STOXX 600 index and
the dollar index hit -0.93 on a rolling 25-day average, the
strongest negative correlation between the two indexes since
1993.
 The euro dipped 0.1 percent to $1.3766.
 Analysts still expect more quantitative easing by the Fed
will continue to sting the U.S. currency versus the euro as the
European Central Bank sticks to its current monetary policy.
 ""Despite the correction we've been seeing, the euro's bull
trend is still in place,"" said John Hydeskov, senior currency
analyst at Danske in Copenhagen.
 However, the euro zone sovereign debt problem remained a
worry for investors. European clearing house LCH.Clearnet
announced it has hiked margin requirements for Irish debt.
 The premium investors demand to hold 10-year Irish
government bonds rather than benchmark German Bunds widened by
10 basis points to 582 bps.
 ""Though the LCH announcement overnight wasn't good, it has
largely already been priced in, it doesn't inspire confidence,""
a bond dealer in Dublin said. ""What with the budget (issue)
still out there, we'll be under pressure until that's passed.""
 Yields on 10-year German Bunds rose 4 bps to 2.479 percent,

 * Sees Canada meeting some rare earth needs in longer term
 * No tradition of helping industry with financial support
 * Open to investment from China if net benefit to Canada
(Adds background, details)
 By Chang-Ran Kim
 YOKOHAMA, Japan, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Canada's trade minister
said China's approach to supplying rare earth minerals to the
world was troubling but presented an opportunity for
resource-rich Canada to step up to the plate.
 ""Everybody is concerned about supply of rare earths,"" Peter
Van Loan told Reuters on Wednesday on the sidelines of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting.
 ""The approach of the Chinese is troubling because it is not a
market approach that they've adopted.""
 Rare earths, a group of 17 metals essential to
high-technology goods from LCD televisions to hybrid cars, are
difficult to source outside of China, which produces more than 97
percent of the global supply.
 Van Loan played down the likelihood of special financial
support from the government for developing Canada's rare earth
sector, although he acknowledged it was unique and warranted
discussion with trade partners on ensuring adequate supply.
 ""For a country like Canada, we do think this represents a
long-term opportunity. We're a country rich in resources
including rare earths, and I expect and hope that we'll be able
to take some steps in the long term and medium term to
meet some of those market needs,"" he said in an interview.
 There are at least 26 publicly traded companies in Canada,
including Great Western Minerals Group and Rare Element
Resources, that have rare earth projects in some stage of
exploration. But good quality, economically feasible deposits are
scarce.
 While mining costs are an issue, Van Loan said it would be up
to the private sector to figure out how to make use of what he
said was a business-friendly environment already in place in
Canada.
 Asked about financial support to miners, he said:
""Traditionally we've not done a great deal of that. We like to
have the market operate and do that properly.""
 He said Natural Resources Canada, a government entity,
provided a great deal of expertise and support, while Canada had
an abundance of skilled workers in the mining field and the
lowest taxes of any major developed economy on new businesses.
 He also said Canada was open to investments in rare earth
mining from companies from any country, including China, as long
as they passed the review process and the ""net benefit to Canada""
test which was used to block BHP Billiton's bid for Potash Corp
this month.

420,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2010 05:44AM ET</span>",HSBC's Green confident of Basel revision on trade finance," SEOUL, Nov 10 (Reuters) - HSBC chairman Stephen Green said on
Wednesday he is confident the new Basel rules on bank regulation
will be amended to take account of their impact on trade finance.
 Firms say that at present the so-called Basel III rules will
significantly push up the cost of trade finance due to the way
they treat bank leverage. But HSBC's Green said he was
confident the Basel committee would amend the rules to take
account of this concern.
 ""Yes, I'm optimistic that we should reach a reasonable
conclusion on that,"" he said during the G20 CEO summit in Seoul,
speaking in his role as vice chairman of the International
Chamber of Commerce.
 However Green added that this was a small part of the Basel
III discussions and he was not calling for the whole package of
reforms to be re-opened.
The new rules require banks to hold capital equivalent to the
value of all off-balance sheet items in order to prevent a repeat
of the financial crisis, when many banks hid toxic assets.
 But documentary letters of credit -- the short-term loans
collateralised on cargoes that have formed the bulk of trade
finance for centuries -- are also held off balance sheets.
 A requirement to fully capitalise such loans instead of
providing capital at 10 or 20 percent of their value as at
present would make them much less profitable for the banks.
 On the wider Basel III rules on capital and liquidity, Green
said it would lead to a stronger financial system but that there
were still a number of issues which needed to be defined.
 ""There are still issues to be resolved, notably on liquidity.
That is a discussion which is going to run into next year,"" he
said.
 Green also told reporters after a press conference that he
was confident HSBC's headquarters would remain in Britain despite
the bank's CEO being located in Hong Kong.

421,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2010 05:44AM ET</span>","BoE sees CPI below target in 2 yrs, ready to act in either way"," LONDON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - British inflation will fall below
target in two years' time, the Bank of England forecast on
Wednesday, but stressed the outlook was highly uncertain and it
stood ready to change policy in either direction.
 While its quarterly Inflation Report left the door open for
more quantitative easing, the BoE also said there was a wider
than usual range of views among Monetary Policy Committee
members on the prospects for both growth and inflation.
 As such, the report is unlikely to settle the debate about
what the central bank will do next, with analysts divided over
whether the BoE will follow the U.S. Federal Reserve down the
path of further monetary easing.
 Minutes of the BoE's last meeting -- when it kept interest
rates at a record low of 0.5 percent and froze its 200 billion
pound QE plan -- will be published next Wednesday.
 Policymakers were split three ways in October, with one
voting for higher rates, one arguing for more QE and the
remaining seven keeping policy on hold.
 The BoE report showed inflation at around 1.6 percent on its
two-year policy horizon, assuming interest rates rise very
slowly in line with market expectations.
 That was slightly higher than the August projection and the
near-term inflation profile has also been revised higher so that
CPI remains above the two percent target throughout 2011,
because of a planned VAT sales tax rise and higher import costs.
 ""As the impact of those factors on inflation diminishes,
inflation is likely to fall back, reflecting continued downward
pressure from the persistent margin of spare capacity,"" the BoE
said in its report.
 ""But the timing and extent of that decline in inflation are
highly uncertain.""
 The BoE said economic growth would slow in 2011 but then
pick up to just over 3 percent in two years' time.
 These forecasts were also highly uncertain, however. Exports
had still not picked up as the BoE had expected and, while
domestic demand could grow rapidly if confidence recovers, there
were also significant downside risks. 
 ""Some households may not yet have fully adjusted to
forthcoming fiscal consolidation,"" the BoE said.

 HONG KONG, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Standard Chartered Plc's Asia
chief executive told Reuters Insider on Wednesday that the bank
plans to increase hiring for its new businesses and sees the
appreciation of China's currency as an opportunity for the bank
and its clients.
 In response to a question on concern over too much money
flowing into emerging markets -- a question that added HSBC
Holdings Plc's recent comment on seeing ""speedbumps"" in these
markets -- Asia Chief Executive Jaspal Bindra cited Brazil and
Korea as fitting that description.
 ""We are seeing pockets where people are, either through
capital reserves and mortgages, trying to arrest the mortgage
bubble,"" Bindra said in the television interview.
 He added the commodities space to his watch list ""because I
think that is the other bubbly space right now"".
 Although based in Britain, the majority of StanChart's
business was focused on Asia, home to 70 percent of the bank's
headcount, business and profitability, Bindra said.
 Areas in which Bindra said he expected to increase hiring
include new businesses, such as equities, corporate finance,
private banking and commodities.
 The Indian national who has spent most of his professional
career as a banker said the industry went through a major shift
after the 2008 financial crisis.
 ""I think the one thing that has surprised us is that for a
long time -- 2001 to 2008 -- clients were very transactional. I
think the experience of the last two years has put them back in a
relationship mode, which we are pleased about,"" he said. ""It's a
fundamental shift to how they approach the business. They no
longer keep going on beauty parades shopping for the best rate.""
 Asked about the global currency issues that have seized
headlines lately, Bindra focused on China's yuan, also known as
the renminbi.
 ""It gives us a new opportunity to play the RMB,"" he said. ""As
people see the reality of yuan appreciation, there is the
potential that there will be a lot more yuan-denominated trade,

from U.S. President Barack Obama to G20 leaders due to meet in
Seoul from Thursday.
 The letter was sent on Tuesday.
 ""As we approach the Seoul Summit, the world is looking to us
to work together to strengthen the global economic recovery,
continue to repair the financial system, and promote the
stability of global markets.
 ""The United States will do its part to restore strong growth,
reduce economic imbalances, and calm markets. A strong recovery
that creates jobs, income and spending is the most important
contribution the United States can make to the global recovery.
 ""The dollar's strength ultimately rests on the fundamental
strength of the U.S. economy. To secure the strong recovery the
global economy needs, the United states joined with its G-20
partners to take decisive action to halt the fall in activity
caused by the deepest crisis we have experienced in generations.
 ""The United States moved quickly to repair our financial
system and to enact the strongest financial reforms since the
1930s.
 ""The United States is committed to an ambitious path of
fiscal consolidation, consistent with our G-20 commitment to
stabilize our public sector debt, as the recovery strengthens.
 ""We all now recognize that the foundation for a strong and
durable recovery will not materialize if American households stop
saving and go back to spending based on borrowing. Yet no one
country can achieve our joint objective of a strong, sustainable,
and balanced recovery on its own.
 ""Just as the United States much change, so to must those
economies that have previously relied on exports to offset
weaknesses in their own demand. A rebalancing of the sources of
global demand, along with market determination of exchange rates
that reverses significant undervaluation, are the best base for
the shifts needed to bring about the vigorous and well-balanced
recovery that we all want.
 ""When all nations do their part -- emerging no less than
advanced, surplus no less than deficit -- we all benefit from
higher growth.
 ""The action plan that our G-20 Finance Ministers and Central
Bank Governors laid out in Gyeongju offers a new consensus on
global economic cooperation. It sets out how unleashing domestic
demand in surplus countries can support strong global growth as
deficit countries increase savings and repair balance sheets
damaged by the crisis.
 ""It commits us all to pursue policies to reduce the risk that
unsustainable external imbalances will re-emerge. It recognizes
the responsibility of countries with reserve currencies, and the
role that market-determined exchange rates -- coupled with a
commitment to refrain from undervaluing currencies for
competitive purposes -- can play in facilitating global
adjustment.
 ""It can help to create a stronger internal monetary system
that avoids destabilizing shifts in capital flows.
 ""We should build on this foundation and ask Finance ministers
and Central Bank Governors, with the support of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), to finalize the details of this consensus
promptly. 
 ""If we work together to avoid the kind of imbalances that
weakened the global economy on the eve of the crisis, we will
bolster the global recovery.
 ""With these shifts, emerging markets will be an increasingly
important source of demand for the global economy.
 ""In that regard, it is important that we discuss how to move
forward on Doha. All G-20 countries have a responsibility to
provide the ambition necessary to reach agreement.
 ""The G-20 Leaders can be proud of our work in the area of
financial sector reform. Our cooperation holds the promise of
banishing the regulatory race to the bottom and opening the way
for a genuine race to the top.
 ""In the United States, the Dodd-Frank legislation will
greatly strengthen consumer protections and financial market
integrity. The Basel Accord will allow us to raise standards
together in a way that, once fully implemented, will enable us to
withstand stresses of the magnitude associated with the recent
financial crisis without extraordinary government support. The
United States will implement the new Basel agreement on the
agreed timelines.
 ""But now is no time to be complacent. The market will not
wait for us to finish. They will test us every day. We need to
press on and complete our reform agenda, with new steps to ensure
no financial institution is too big to fail. 
 ""We must work together to ensure large interconnected firms
have a greater capacity to absorb losses. Each of us must also
put in place a strong national resolution regime that protects
taxpayers, and we must build on top of our national systems a
framework for cross-border cooperation to promote the safe wind
down of even the largest and most complex global institutions.
 ""We must press ahead with the other important financial
sector reform items on this agenda. 
 ""We need to work together to assure that the momentum of
reform does not falter. We should also take great pride in the
historic progress that we have made to modernize the world's
economic governance institutions over the past 2 years.
 ""The IMF now has the resources it needs to fight crisis,
better tools for preventing future crisis, and more effective
governance. 
 ""These reforms, like our plan to support a well-balanced
global recovery reflect the growing role and responsibilities of
dynamic emerging market countries in the global economy.
 ""Finally, we should advance our cooperation to address common
global challenges. The Korean presidency has highlighted the key
role growth has played in lifting so many out of poverty,
especially in emerging Asia, and drawn attention to what we all
can do to increase the potential for inclusive growth in
low-income countries. 
 ""We should make sustained efforts to carry through with our
groundbreaking Pittsburgh commitment to phase out fossil fuel
subsidies.
 ""And we should recognize our special responsibilities to
prevent corruption and promote a clean business environment.

 Many newly launched toushin funds during the month were a
type that allows investors to select the currency in which they
want to hold their investment, known as currency-selective funds.
 Nomura Asset Management's equities fund that invests in
infrastructure-related equities drew the strongest demand in
October, with initial inflows totalling 54.1 billion yen.
 Large inflows were also seen in Nomura Asset's equities funds
that invest in Chinese shares, which drew 29.5 billion yen worth
of fresh money.

430,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2010 04:52AM ET</span>",Fish as farmed food: aquaculture draws investors,"* Private equity firms bet on shift to protein diets
* Southeast Asia, Central Asia seen poised to benefit
 
 GENEVA, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Agriculture investors keen to
profit from rising demand for commodities say they are turning
their attention to aquaculture, betting that farmed fish can
meet the protein needs of a growing, hungry world.
 Diets in China and other fast-developing countries have
changed alongside rising incomes, shifting towards beef and
other types of meat, which require high volumes of water and
grain to produce.
 Kevin Schwartz, a partner at U.S. private equity firm Paine
& Partners, said there was also significant appetite for fish as
an alternative protein source that can be raised in a
sustainable way.
 ""Aquaculture is a way to meet that demand,"" he told the
bankers, fund managers and investors gathered in Geneva at the
Global AgInvesting conference.
 Rich Gammill, managing director of Black River Asset
Management, part of agri-business giant Cargill, said fish such
as tilapia raised in aquaculture could find plentiful customers
around the world.
 ""It just makes sense economically for people to turn to fish
as a low-cost source of protein,"" he said, suggesting farming
fish can also avoid ecological damage from over-fishing oceans
and rivers, drawing in developed market customers too.
 ""From a sustainability point, this needs to be developed,""
he told the conference.
 Some 80 percent of frozen tilapia -- a popular high-protein,
low-calorie fish that is native to warm waters -- sold in the
United States is now sourced from China, according to Gammill.
 ""There is an opportunity for Central America, for southeast
Asia and for other markets who have control over their water
quality and practices to play a much greater role,"" he said.
 Black River is also significantly involved in the dairy
sector in China as well as infrastructure along the food and
soft commodity supply chain, including processing.

 * Fed QE to keep dollar under selling pressure
 * Periphery concerns may cap euro gains
(Updates throughout, adds comment; previous TOKYO)
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the dollar
on Wednesday, boosted by Middle East buying, while key technical
support helped curb selling of the single currency, seen in the
past few days.
 The euro recovered from a three-day losing streak versus the
dollar, as investors speculated more quantitative easing by the
Federal Reserve will continue to sting the U.S. currency as the
European Central Bank sticks to its current monetary policy.
 Analysts said the dollar's bounce since late last week would
be short-lived and the euro would continue its uptrend, after it
hit its highest in nine months versus the dollar last week.
""Despite the correction we've been seeing, the euro's bull
trend is still in place,"" said John Hydeskov, senior currency
analyst at Danske in Copenhagen.
 ""With the Fed pumping $600 billion into the economy and the
ECB sticking to its current policy (under which monetary easing
is unlikely), we're going to continue to see a divergence in
policy.""
 By 0917 GMT, the euro rose 0.2 percent on the day to
$1.3808, with traders citing solid buying by Mideast names as
helping pull the single currency back from a slide to around
$1.3732.
 That was roughly a low hit in late October, and technical
analysts said it was offering support to the single currency.
 The dollar was little changed versus a currency basket,
while it slipped slightly against the yen to 81.66 yen,
retreating from the day's high around 81.90 yen.
 Traders cited dollar buying by Japanese names, but also said
sell-orders from Japanese exporters around 82.00 yen was helping
block a rise in the dollar beyond that level.
 Sterling was little changed at $1.5980, as investors awaited
the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report later in the
day for clues as to whether the UK central bank will embark on
more quantitative easing.
 Markets are still betting the central bank may eventually
expand its 200 billion pound ($320 billion) asset purchase
programme, although recent firm data has reduced expectations of
such a move.
 ""Should the inflation report make it clear that quantitative
easing remains an option for the BoE that would put pressure on
sterling,"" Commerzbank analysts said in a note.

 PERIPHERY CONCERNS
 The dollar was unable to sustain gains made in earlier
trade, when a rise in long-dated U.S. Treasury yields helped
spur some demand for U.S. assets. The 30-year Treasury yield
hovered near a five-month high hit on Tuesday.
 The euro's gains were limited, however, by investors' focus
on debt problems facing some euro zone countries, including
Ireland and Portugal. The gap between benchmark Irish and German
yield spreads expanded to its widest ever level on Wednesday.
 A near-term risk for the euro is a Portuguese government
bond auction later on Wednesday.
 Portugal, seen by markets as a possible candidate for a
Greek-style bailout, is scheduled to sell up to 1.25 billion
euros ($1.72 billion) of government debt.
 Tuesday's move by a Chinese credit rating agency to cut the
sovereign rating it assigns the United States underscored
growing tension between Beijing and Washington over economic
policy ahead of a Group of 20 leaders' summit on Thursday and
Friday in Seoul.

 * FDI levels not ""very volatile""
 * Capital flows consistent with current account deficit
 By Krittivas Mukherjee
 SEOUL, Nov 10 (Reuters) - There is no need for India to
introduce capital controls on portfolio flows and foreign direct
investment levels are not very volatile, a top Indian policy
maker said on Wednesday.
 Many fear a U.S. Federal Reserve move to buy $600 billion
more in government bonds by June 2011 will lead to a surge of
""hot money"" inflows to emerging markets such as India, South
Korea and Brazil.
 The debate could have negative repercussions for this week's
Group of 20 meeting in Seoul, and with many emerging countries
willing to retaliate, a meaningful outcome to the currency and
global imbalance debate now looks a little bleak.
 Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of the Planning
Commission, which charts India's economic growth path, said he
saw no need at the moment to alter policy in India to control
capital flows.
 ""I personally do not think there is any need to alter the
present policy for foreign direct investment because I think
that's not a very volatile thing, and if we get more of it within
the realm of possibility then it's excellent,"" Ahluwalia told
Reuters.
 ""I also do not think at the present moment there is any need
to introduce any capital controls on portfolio flows. We have
capital controls on debt and I do not think we should relax those
too readily. But yes those are things that you look at on a month
by month basis.""
 Central banks in countries such as Japan and South Korea that
are faced with a rising currency have indicated they may take
measures to counter the appreciation pressure.
 INDIAN SUPPORT FOR QE2?
 India's response has been measured in comparison with other
economies such as China, South Korea and Brazil who have sharply
criticised the latest round of quantitative easing by the United
States.
 India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, has however
maintained it will only intervene in foreign exchange markets if
inflows turn ""lumpy"" or ""volatile"".
 The Indian rupee has appreciated 5.1 percent in 2010.
 India's prime minister this week offered qualified support
for the Federal Reserve's attempt at monetary stimulus, saying
anything that stimulates the underlying growth impulses of
entrepreneurship in the United States would help the cause of
global prosperity.
 Ahluwalia said India was running a current account deficit
consciously in the belief that it would be able to finance it.
 ""We are consciously following a strategy in which we want to
step up investment in a world in which Indian exports for a while
will not do as well as they might otherwise,"" he said.

 DUESSELDORF, Germany, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Germany's E.ON, the
world's largest utility, plans to expand its power generation
business to two new markets outside Europe and energy trading
globally as growth on the continent stalls.
 The triple whammy of slumping demand, declining power and
gas prices as well as the prospect of higher taxes in markets
such as Germany has made the industry the worst performing
sector in Europe for the second year in a row.
 Having expanded into Russia and the United States, the
Duesseldorf-based power provider is planning to give more weight
to markets outside Europe, a strategy that has also helped
competitors such as GDF Suez and Enel.
 A person with knowledge of the matter had told Reuters on
Tuesday that south-eastern Asia was one of the regions E.ON was
considering entering.
 Chief Executive Johannes Teyssen, at the helm of the company
since May, plans to lay out details of his strategy for the
company later on Wednesday, but still has to work out key
details of the road ahead.
 ""We are analysing which markets we'll target and will decide
that soon,"" said a spokesman on Wednesday, declining to be more
specific.
 E.ON expects earnings to decline for the next three years
straight, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on
Tuesday, disappointing current market forecasts.
 The expectations of the company will further hit perceptions
of the sector as a whole.

 COPENHAGEN, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Shipping and oil group A.P.
Moller-Maersk hiked its 2010 profit forecast to around $5
billion as it posted forecast-beating profits for nine months,
driven by cost cuts and higher freight rates and oil prices.
 The upgrade from the previous guidance for a full-year net
result exceeding $4 billion stemmed mainly from higher rates for
container shipping and efficiency improvements, the group said.
 Maersk's report followed strong third-quarter results from
Asian rivals such as China COSCO and Neptune Orient Lines (NOL)
, pointing to a sustained recovery from a dismal 2009 for
shipping as global trade regains momentum.
 Net profit at the group, which owns the world's biggest
container shipping company Maersk Line, totalled 23.8 billion
Danish crowns ($4.4 billion) in January-September against losses
of 3.9 billion in the same period last year.
 The result beat an average expectation of a profit of 21.4
billion crowns in a Reuters poll of analysts whose estimates
ranged from 19.9 billion to 22.9 billion.
 Shares in Maersk seesawed in early trade to trade up 0.69
percent by 1100 GMT, outperforming a 0.24 percent lower
Copenhagen bourse.
 Cheuvreux analyst Joakim Ahlberg called the third-quarter
results ""very solid"" and said he would make minor increases to
earnings estimates on the back of the report.
 Average freight rates, including bunker surcharges, were
up 34 percent in the nine months to end-September from the same
period last year, and volumes 7 percent higher, Maersk said.
Chief Executive Nils Smedegaard Andersen said in a
conference call that the improved competitiveness through cost
savings was ""a very big factor"" driving the results.
 ""More than half of the improvement in our results compared
to last year came from the cost side,"" Andersen said, adding
that rates remain below 2008 levels.
 He said Maersk had reached its 2010 target of at least $500
million in benefits from savings and streamlining and he
estimated the full-year effect at up to $1 billion.
 ""We will continue our focus on cost reductions ...The whole
organisation is becoming much more cost-focused than it was a
few years ago,"" Andersen said.
 The group expects a seasonal decline in volumes and freight
rates for the container activities towards the end of the year
and consequently a somewhat lower result in the fourth quarter
than in the previous quarters, Maersk said.
 Andersen said in a video on the group's website he sees the
container shipping market growing 6 percent next year and the
company is ready to expand.
 He declined in a telephone interview with Reuters to
forecast freight rates going forward, but said cost cuts would
help Maersk Line perform well relative to peers even if rates
fell.
 
 EMERGING MARKET DEMAND
 The group, which is sometimes seen as a barometer of world
trade, said the container shipping market continued to show
positive development, though growth in the third quarter
was lower than in the preceding quarters.
 ""Private consumption shows relatively weak growth in the
United States and Europe, and the positive seasonal fluctuation
in the third quarter of 2010 was smaller than expected,"" said
Maersk whose container shipping fleet numbers 560 vessels.
 Global growth is being driven by increased demand in
emerging markets and imports of goods and components from
low-cost countries to Europe and North America, Maersk said.
 Higher oil prices helped the conglomerate's oil and gas
business, its second major leg, deliver operating results in
line with analysts' estimates though production declined by 17
percent mainly due to lower share from its Qatar field.
 Andersen said that some parts of the reservoir of the Al
Shaheen field in Qatar had been disappointing, with the flow
lower than expected, but he said he did not expect any change in
the resource in place.
 Maersk's tanker business lost money in the first nine months
of the year with rates under pressure.
 ""The tanker market this year has been very poor, and we do
not see anything that makes us very optimistic in the short
term,"" Andersen said.

 * Says U.S. congress not right place for yuan discussion
 * Says leaders eye G20 for cooperation, not confrontation
 By Zhou Xin and Alan Wheatley
 SEOUL, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The G20 summit will try to address
global challenges and should not discuss China's yuan or any
other specific currency, China's vice foreign minister said on
Wednesday.
 Cui Tiankai said many developing countries were concerned
about the liquidity being injected into the global economy as a
result of the latest monetary easing by the Federal Reserve, the
U.S. central bank.
 Asked whether the yuan would be discussed at the summit, Cui
said: ""I think there is a broad agreement among G20 members that
we should not focus on any particular currency of any particular
member, because this is not the root cause of the global economic
problems.""
 Washington blames Beijing for keeping the yuan at what it
considers an artificially low level that gives Chinese exporters
an unfair advantage in global markets.
 ""The recent crisis is certainly caused not by the Chinese
currency or any other emerging market's currency,"" Cui, who was
speaking in English, added.
 In listing the ""structural problems"" the G20 must tackle, Cui
mentioned imbalances in global development and the international
financial system as well as ""weakness in international regulation
and supervision"".
 Abundant liquidity, especially after the Fed decided last
week to print money to buy $600 billion worth of U.S. government
bonds ""is posing some risks to the financial stability of many
countries, including the BRIC countries"", Cui said, referring to
Brazil, Russia, India and China.
 ""I think many other developing countries and emerging markets
have similar concerns,"" he said.
 ""It's quite possible that many G20 members will express that
concern at the summit with recommendations and proposals on how
to deal with the situation,"" said Cui, China's senior G20
negotiator.
 U.S. RELATIONS STILL SOUND
 Cui, who has been working on the draft of the communique that
will be issued on Friday after the two-day meeting, said China
was ready to use its greater voting power in the International
Monetary Fund to make the fund better serve the interests of
developing countries. He did not elaborate.
 Cui said the relationship between Beijing and Washington
remained sound despite the recent passage of a bill by the House
of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress, that aims to
punish China for holding down the yuan.
 China had maintained effective communication with the United
States over key policies, he said.
 ""I don't think the U.S. Congress is the right place to
discuss or to take any decision on the Chinese currency -- it is
certainly not the right place,"" he said.
 Cui said he hoped the G20 summit would send strong messages
against trade protectionism and in support of international
monetary reform.
 ""The leaders are coming to Seoul for better coordination and
cooperation. They are not coming for confrontation,"" he said.

 HONG KONG, Nov 10 (Reuters) - A strong U.S. economy is in
both Asia's and the world's interest, British finance minister
George Osborne said on Wednesday in a speech in Hong Kong,
seemingly reaffirming the need for U.S. quantitative easing.
 Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer declined to take a

who say it will unleash speculative money that leads to inflated
asset bubbles and strengthened currencies.

just before a highly-anticipated G20 leaders summit in Seoul
aimed at easing global economic imbalances -- George Osborne
stressed the need for a strong U.S. economy, echoing Washington's
view that monetary easing is critical to kick-starting the
American economy.
 ""Lots of people have been quite ready to criticise the U.S.
on its monetary policy in the past few days. I would just make
this observation; it's in everyone's interests that the U.S.
economy gets motoring again ... that is of enormous importance
for Asia, it's of enormous importance to Europe as well,"" he
said.
 ""For all the problems in the U.S. ... don't underestimate one
of the most dynamic economies the world has ever seen, and I hope
like everyone else that the U.S. economy is going to be back
firing on all cylinders.""
 Osborne, who met with Chinese officials in Beijing ahead of
the G20 summit in South Korea, called on countries to resist
protectionism in all its forms and to reduce trade barriers.
 He has also said the G20 meetings need to bolster
multilateral cooperation to reduce economic imbalances.
 Chinese officials have been increasingly blunt in their
criticism of the loose monetary policies of the United States,
warning that Washington could destabilise the global economy and
inflate asset bubbles.
 When asked to what extent a strong Chinese currency had
contributed to global economic imbalances, Osborne sidestepped
the issue and said the underlying causes were more complex.
 ""The imbalance issue is a much broader issue and if you just
reduce it to the level of currencies, I think you are missing a
much broader economic argument here which is how do we get
surplus and deficit countries to work together to try and reduce
the imbalances.""
 On the longer term trend of the internationalisation of
China's currency, the yuan, Osborne said London was interested in
tapping new growth opportunities as Beijing leans increasingly on
the financial hub of Hong Kong as an offshore yuan settlement
centre.
 ""London has a great role as a partner of Hong Kong in
developing new Asian business, including the internationalisation
of the renminbi. I think there is a massive opportunity.""
 ""This is a potentially very, very substantial new market for
London and for Hong Kong as partners.""

 By Harry Suhartono and Balazs Koranyi
 SINGAPORE/SYDNEY, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines
will replace engines on three of its Airbus A380 planes after
finding oil stains on them, almost a week after Australian
rival Qantas grounded its A380 fleet due to an engine failure.
 Qantas's six A380s have been grounded since Thursday, when
a Rolls-Royce engine partly disintegrated mid-flight, forcing
the fully laden Airbus to make an emergency landing in the
biggest incident to date for the world's largest passenger jet.
 Investigations into that incident have focused on oil leaks
inside the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines, the same model used
to power Singapore Airlines' and German Lufthansa's A380 fleet.
 But Singapore Airlines stressed the problems on three of
its 11 A380s were precautionary and unrelated as the oil stains
were different from the oil leakage in the Qantas turbines.
 Singapore's findings may deal a fresh blow to Rolls-Royce,
which moved on Monday to contain a crisis of confidence, saying
it was making progress in understanding what caused last week's
blowout on the Qantas A380 flight.
 ""This is a precautionary move to find out what caused the
oil stains."" a Singapore Airlines spokeswoman said.
""Rolls-Royce recommended a detailed inspection of the engines.""
 Singapore Airlines said later its other Airbus A380
aircraft were still in service, but could not rule out further
engine changes.
 ""At this stage there is no indication that more engines on
our A380 aircraft will need to have precautionary engine
changes carried out, but I would certainly not rule it out,""
airline spokeswoman Bryony Duncan-Smith told an Australian
radio.
 INVESTIGATION FOCUSES ON DESIGN FAULT
 Rolls-Royce shares already lost over 7 percent since the
Qantas incident, while Airbus and Qantas shares both slipped
2.5 percent each. Singapore Airlines shares were little
affected on Tuesday with the stock down 0.4 percent by 0700
GMT.
 A spokesman for Rolls-Royce declined to comment.
 Experts said the Qantas investigation is pointing to a
design fault with the engine which may not be difficult to fix
but will take time.
 ""From information provided to date, it would appear to be a
design issue and not a power setting issue. Lower power
settings are not the solution,"" said Peter Marosszeky, an
aviation expert at the University of New South Wales.
 He added similar engine issues are not unknown to the
aviation industry and a fix could be relatively easy, but it
could take some time.
 ""Until then, what could happen is Airbus would allow
operators to fly the A380 on a limited basis with restrictions
on the engines,"" Marosszeky added.
 However, restriction could be a problem for Qantas, as its
routes from Los Angeles to Australia are the longest served by
the A380, and lower power limits would mean weight
restrictions, making flights less economical.
 Sources earlier told Reuters that Qantas is reviewing the
way it operates its A380s engines and whether its higher power
settings on take-off contributed to the engine failure.
 Singapore Airlines' three affected airplanes, scattered in
London, Melbourne and Sydney, are being flown back to Singapore
to be equipped with similar Rolls-Royce engines.
 One of the jets took off from Sydney around 0400 GMT while
the passengers scheduled to be on the airplane are being
transferred to other flights, a Reuters reporter at the airport
said.
 Qantas is expected to give an update on its A380 fleet by
Thursday afternoon. The airline said on Monday it would ground
its six planes for at least 72 hours.
 ""We are still continuing with checks,"" a Qantas spokesman
said on Wednesday.
 On Tuesday, a Boeing 787 test flight made an emergency
landing in Texas with smoke in the cabin, the first incident of
its kind, putting additional scrutiny on the already delayed
programme.

 * Ministers agree to avoid protectionist measures

 (Recasts with draft statement, comments by Canada minister on
first day of meeting)
 By Yoko Kubota and Yoko Nishikawa
 YOKOHAMA, Japan, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Asia-Pacific leaders will
call for policies that promote balanced growth and start work on
creating a vast free trade area in the world's most dynamic
economic region.
 In a draft statement to be issued at this weekend's summit of
the 21 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC),
the leaders will adopt what they called their first real effort
to provide a framework for long-term growth in the region.
 The group includes the world's three biggest economy --
China, Japan and the United States.
 On Wednesday, APEC trade and foreign ministers agreed to
avoid taking any new protectionist measures for the next three
years, and urged a conclusion of the Doha round of trade
liberalisation talks in 2011, Japanese officials said.
 The ministers said they would build on the 43 bilateral and
mini-free trade pacts with each other.
 Businesses have long urged a single pact for the Pacific rim
to simplify and harmonise the plethora of standards and rules
that has been a by-product of the many mini-pacts.
 The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
-- most of whom are APEC members -- has its own free trade area
and is building an EU-style economic community. ASEAN also has
various pacts with APEC members China, Korea, Japan, Australia
and New Zealand.
 Those agreements, and a U.S.-led one called the Trans-Pacific
Partnership (TPP) that is being negotiated among eight nations,
will be the main building blocks of the Free Trade Area of the
Asia-Pacific (FTAAP), Japan's Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara told
reporters.
 An Asia-Pacific free trade area would be a formidable force
in world trade. APEC economies account for 53 percent of global
economic output and 44 percent of world trade.
 The ministers met ahead of a G20 summit of rich and emerging
economies in Seoul on Thursday and Friday, where leaders will try
to soothe tensions over global economic imbalances and
currencies. APEC leaders meet on Nov. 13-14.
 ""U.S. businesses still have concerns about policies that
inhibit their ability to compete in Asia-Pacific,"" U.S. Secretary
of Commerce Gary Locke said in a speech in Tokyo. ""They want to
ensure that their access to raw materials and exposure to
currency risk is dictated by market, and not political forces.""
 AGRICULTURE KEY CHALLENGE
 Agriculture poses a potential obstacle to APEC's vision of
free trade in the region, Australian Trade Minister Craig Emerson
said on Wednesday.
 ""The opening up of agricultural sectors of APEC economies
remains a key challenge,"" Emerson said in a statement. ""Some APEC
economies maintain very high levels of protection in
agriculture.""
 Underscoring the political difficulties in opening up
agriculture to free trade, thousands of Japanese farmers rallied
on Wednesday in Tokyo to demand their government steer clear of a
separate and smaller U.S. free trade initiative.
 Japan's politically influential, but inefficient, rice
farmers have long been protected from cheap imports, including
from fellow APEC members the United States, Thailand and Vietnam.
 Japan's government has in the past cited food security and
preserving an agrarian culture as reasons, but is now leaning
towards opening up so that its companies can compete globally.
 The touchy subject of China's clamp on exports of rare earths
also came up on the sidelines of the APEC meetings, something
that has added to tension among a number of major economies which
rely on supplies from China for their lucrative high-tech
industries.
 China controls about 97 percent of the world's supply of rare
earth which are the source of 17 metals used high-technology
goods from LCD televisions to clean energy.
 Japan and the United States had agreed on the need to address
the problem of relying too much on a single country for
production and supply of rare earths, a Japanese government
official said on Wednesday.
 ""Everybody is concerned about supply of rare earths,""
Canada's Trade Minister Peter Van Loan told Reuters.
 ""The approach of the Chinese is troubling because it is not a
market approach that they've adopted.""

 * Euro support at $1.3735 holds, rebounds but soft
 * NZD hit by dovish central bank comments
 * BoE inflation report key for sterling
 By Ian Chua and Charlotte Cooper
 SYDNEY/TOKYO, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The dollar's sharp rebound
hit turbulence on Wednesday, with the currency faltering near
significant chart resistance levels and with precious metals,
which had fallen sharply and given it a boost, starting to
recover.
 The euro, which lost 1 percent on Tuesday as euro zone debt
concerns pressured it, twice bounced off support at $1.3735 in
choppy trade although its recovery was limited.
 The dollar also failed to push through a significant barrier
at 82.00 yen. One dealer said the greenback ran into selling by a
short-term player as it neared 82.00 yen, with Japanese exporter
sell orders lined up at that level and above also expected to
prove a hurdle to its rebound.
 Still, the dollar has recovered close to important chart
levels which could indicate a sharper comeback if they give way.
The euro has key support at $1.3700, with a break there opening
up the possibility of a test down to $1.3365.
 ""If you look at the last few days, the dollar has gained some
traction,"" said Mitul Kotecha, global head of FX strategy at
Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.
 ""It seems like a credible bounce back. I don't see it going
too far but it shows you how short the market was.""
 Longer-dated U.S. Treasury bond yields jumped on Tuesday and
the market will be watching an auction of 30-year debt later on
Wednesday to see if demand is lean.
 ""The ultimate theme of the market is U.S. interest rates,""
said a trader at a Japanese bank. ""If U.S. bond yields rise
further after today's auction the dollar could see more upside.""
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance
against a basket of major currencies, rose as high as 77.88 -- a
level not seen since Oct. 28.
 It was last at 77.80 and faces major resistance in the
78.27-36 band, where a break would signal its fall has bottomed
out at least for the near term. Support lies at 77.30-40.
 The euro fell as low as $1.3735, down almost 4
percent from last week's peak around $1.4283. It edged back to
$1.3775, flat on the day in highly choppy trading which also saw
it gain as far as $1.3794.
 A near-term risk for the euro is a Portuguese government bond
auction later on Wednesday.
 Portugal, seen by markets as a possible candidate for a
Greek-style bailout, is scheduled to sell up to 1.25 billion
euros ($1.72 billion) of government debt.
 The premium investors demand to hold Irish and Portuguese
debt over benchmark German bunds has blown out to euro lifetime
highs and traders said the European Central Bank was again
forced to step in to calm the market.
 ""The euro chart is not looking pretty. A rise in U.S. yields
is undermining the euro and now we have Ireland and Portugal
issues. The euro does not have positive factors on its own,"" the
Japanese bank trader said.
 Part of the dollar's climb on Tuesday came from a vicious
reversal in silver, which rippled through the commodity sector.
Investors have been borrowing in dollars to fund leveraged
positions and the pullback in prices forced some to liquidate
positions and buy back the currency.
 Gold and silver were both edging up on Wednesday.
 The dollar ticked up 0.1 percent against the Japanese yen,
though it is facing major resistance at 82 yen. It rose to 81.98
yen on Tuesday -- the highest in nearly two weeks.
 The Aussie, which briefly dipped below parity on Tuesday,
stood flat at $1.0041, down about 1.5 percent from a 28-year peak
above $1.0180 set this month.
 The New Zealand dollar, which fell 1.3 percent on Tuesday,
recovered from losses following dovish comments by Reserve Bank
of New Zealand Governor Alan Bollard, who said the strength of
the local dollar could limit future interest rate rises.
 The NZ dollar climbed 0.3 percent to $0.7795, though it is
still down more than 2 percent from a 31-month high
near $0.7980 set last week.
 Earlier it was also hit by by media reports of a U.S. ban on
New Zealand's kiwi fruit vines.
 A move by a Chinese credit ratings agency to cut the U.S.
sovereign credit rating underscored growing tension between
Beijing and Washington over economic policy ahead of a Group of
20 leaders summit on Thursday and Friday in Seoul.
 Sterling was steady after breaching support at $1.6000 to
stand at $1.5984. Sterling's near-term fortunes hinge on a Bank
of England inflation report due at 1030 GMT.
 Markets are still betting the central bank may eventually
expand its 200 billion pound ($320 billion) asset purchase
programme, although recently firm data has reduced expectations
of such a move.

448,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2010 01:12AM ET</span>",TIMELINE-The G20's bumpy path from panic to recovery," By Emily Kaiser
 SEOUL, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The Group of 20 rich and emerging
economies came together at the height of the financial crisis in
2008 to try to prevent a global recession from becoming a
depression.
 Its coordinated efforts are credited with short-circuiting
the financial panic and restoring economic growth, albeit still
sluggish in many regions.
 Here is a look at the first four leaders' summits and what is
left to be done at the fifth in Seoul this week.
 WASHINGTON, NOVEMBER 2008:
 The first summit came just two months after the collapse of
Lehman Brothers triggered a meltdown that brought the world's
financial system to the brink of collapse. Talk was rampant of a
Great Depression 2.0.
 Global trade had dropped off a cliff as financing dried up,
spreading the economic pain to exporting countries that had
managed to avoid the banking crisis. U.S. and European officials
were scrambling to bail out financial firms at risk of failure
and guarantee savers' deposits.
 The main accomplishment of this meeting was simply getting
everyone in the same room. It was a tacit acknowledgment that the
G7 club of rich countries could not solve this problem alone, and
needed to get emerging markets on board.
 Leaders pledged to work together to restore growth and create
a financial regulatory structure that was strong enough to
prevent a repeat of the crisis.
 LONDON, APRIL 2009:
 In the five months between the Washington and London summits,
global stock markets tanked and investors questioned the solvency
of some of the biggest banks. The Dow Jones Global Titans index
of the largest companies fell 14 percent.
 Calling this the ""greatest challenge to the world economy in
modern times"" the G20 said it would do whatever it took to arrest
the economic free-fall.
 The centrepiece was tripling the International Monetary
Fund's resources so that it could support emerging and developing
economies caught in the downdraft.
 U.S. President Barack Obama received a rock star's welcome,
and even met with Queen Elizabeth.
 PITTSBURGH, SEPTEMBER 2009:
 A year after Lehman Brothers, leaders could breathe a bit
easier knowing they had averted a depression. Indeed, they felt
so confident of their success that they declared in their closing
statement: ""It worked.""
 The focal point was the ""Framework for Strong, Sustainable
and Balanced Growth,"" which was a commitment to adopt domestic
policies that would foster healthier global growth less prone to
the booms and busts that marked the last decade.
 The idea was that exporting powerhouses such as China and
Germany would act to bolster domestic demand, while the
borrow-and-spend countries such as the United States and Britain
would embrace savings and investment.
 As part of this U.S.-led push for rebalancing, each country
submitted medium-term economic plans for IMF review of whether
they were mutually compatible.
 TORONTO, JUNE 2010:
 The first signs of fractures were clearly visible in Toronto
as a synchronized global recession gave way to a multi-speed
recovery.
 Greece's debt troubles turned attention on the precarious
state of some European governments' finances and cast doubt on
the very survival of the euro zone.
 Germany led a drive toward austerity, arguing that healthy
government finances would foster confidence and that in turn
would drive stronger economic growth.
 The United States saw dangerous parallels with 1937, when its
own government abruptly cut spending thinking the recession was
over. Instead, the cutbacks prolonged the depression.
 Papering over their differences, the G20 agreed to halve
deficits by 2013, which sounded bold but in reality was nothing
beyond what governments -- including the United States -- had
already promised. That pledge exempted Japan, which carries the
largest government debt burden as a percentage of GDP.
 The IMF told leaders that if they adopted complementary
domestic economic policies, global output could be $4 trillion
higher in the medium term than if they go their separate ways.
 SEOUL, NOVEMBER 2010:
 Divisions have deepened as the pace of recovery diverges. The
United States, Europe and Japan appear stuck in neutral while
emerging markets charge ahead.
 This was supposed to be the culmination of two years of G20
cooperation, marking the end of crisis and the beginning of a new
era of shared growth.
 Although leaders are expected to endorse a deepening of the
""framework"" first agreed in Pittsburgh, the frictions are
unmistakable.
 Currencies have moved to the centre. A weak U.S. dollar, a
consequence of slow growth and the Federal Reserve's easy money
policy, has sent investors into higher-yielding markets, raising
the risk of asset bubbles and inflation.
 Regulatory reform remains unfinished. Although leaders will
most likely approve ""Basel III"" reforms of bank capital rules,
they have yet to figure out how to safely shut down large,
international firms in danger of collapsing.
 Leaders will no doubt put on a show of unity this week,
heralding accomplishments such as extending the ""Framework"" and
promising to avoid competitive currency devaluations.
 Unless they can defuse the growing tensions, however,
questions will remain about whether this group that could shine
in crisis is now too unwieldy and diverse to effectively
safeguard the recovery.

 ZURICH, Nov 10 (Reuters) - There is a limit to withdrawing
ultra-loose monetary policy, in light of currency markets and
economic sluggishness in the United States, Canada's central
bank chief told a Swiss paper.
 ""Evidently, given the weakness of the U.S. economy and the
tensions on the foreign exchange markets, there's a limit to

Carney was quoted as saying by daily Le Temps on Wednesday.
 ""That's why we took a pause at our last meeting.""
 Carney also said that the Federal Reserve's second bout of
quantitative easing to support a flagging recovery in the
United States could have an impact on Canada's economy.
 He said talk even before the QE was implemented had led to
a marked improvement to financial markets, even if a weakening
of the dollar had offset some of these positive effects.
 Carney was in Switzerland following a meeting of global
central bank heads at the Bank for International Settlements in
Basel.

 SEOUL, Nov 10 (Reuters) - South Korea is preparing to
impose fresh measures aimed at reducing sharp swings in
cross-border capital flows and in the won , in addition
to restrictions unveiled in June on currency derivatives trades
by banks.
 President Lee Myung-bak and his top finance officials have
been priming investors for weeks for additional steps as South
Korea is more exposed to market gyrations than its peers
because of its high short-term foreign debt.
 South Korea is hosting the Group of 20 major economies'

 Steps countries are taking to counter hot money
[ID:nSGE69503F]
 
Following are the expected measures that South Korea's
financial authorities may adopt to reduce the sharp swings in
capital flows into and out of the country:
 RE-IMPOSITION OF A TAX ON BOND INVESTORS
 Probability: high
 The government will likely unwind a months'-old exemption
on a 14 percent withholding tax on interest income that foreign
investors earn from holdings of domestic treasury and monetary
stabilisation bonds.
 A lawmaker from the ruling Grand National Party is
preparing to submit a bill to re-impose the tax as early as
this Friday , one of his aides has told Reuters, and local
media reported the ministry would support the move. The aide
said it was hoped the bill would be passed by the end of the
current session on Dec 9 and take effect in January
 This is seen as the easiest step for the government to take
because it is not creating a new taxation. It will most likely
hurt foreign purchases of long-term bonds at a time when a
pick-up in inflation has already made them less attractive.
 IMPOSING A NEW TAX ON FX BORROWING
 Probability: medium-high
 The government may decide to levy a tax on short-term
borrowings from abroad to discourage banks from borrowing cheap
funds overseas and lending them out domestically at higher
interest rates.
 Such a move would have a significant impact on borrowing by
banks operating in the country, but the impact on fund inflows
for investment in domestic bonds will be limited because
offshore investors may bring in their own funds.
 It will take far more time for the government to go through
the legislation process because the idea has not been
publicised widely and so could require lengthy discussion among
lawmakers.
 REDUCTION IN FX DERIVATIVES CEILING
 Probability: medium
 The financial authorities may lower the ceiling on the
amount of currency derivatives trades a foreign bank or branch
operating in South Korea can take from 250 percent of its
equity capital, adopted in measures announced in June.
 The Bank of Korea and the Financial Supervisory Service
have already warned the ceiling could be readjusted if deemed
necessary to further restrict short-term foreign debt brought
in to buy dollar/won forward sales.
 This will help reduce short-term funds flowing into the
derivatives market, but could move cross-currency swaps lower,
tightening the basis over interest rate swaps and putting off
arbitrage traders and hedge funds.
 LIMITING NDF TRADING BAND
 Probability: low
 Imposing limits on the net sell or buy positions that each
bank operating in the country can hold in non-deliverable
forward trading to restrict excessive bets on the won's rise or
fall.
 The measures announced in June already partly restrict the
amount of NDF positions that banks can take but this more
direct ceiling could give an additional impact.
 A top South Korean regulator said last week it would launch
a special monitoring system for NDF positions on a constant
basis. [ID:nSUL000190] [ID:nTOE6A4057]

 By Harry Suhartono and Balazs Koranyi
 SINGAPORE/SYDNEY, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines
will replace engines on three of its Airbus A380 planes after
finding oil stains on them, almost a week after Australian
rival Qantas grounded its A380 fleet due to an engine failure.
 Qantas' six A380s have been grounded since Thursday, when a
Rolls-Royce engine partly disintegrated mid-flight, forcing the
fully laden Airbus to make an emergency landing in the biggest
incident to date for the world's largest passenger jet.
 Investigations into that incident have focused on oil leaks
inside the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines, the same model used
to power Singapore Airlines' and German Lufthansa's A380 fleet.
 But Singapore Airlines stressed the problems on three of
its 11 A380s were precautionary and unrelated as the oil stains
were different from the oil leakage in the Qantas turbines.
 Singapore's findings may deal a fresh blow to Rolls Royce,
which moved on Monday to contain a crisis of confidence, saying
it was making progress in understanding what caused last week's
blowout on the Qantas A380 flight.
 ""This is a precautionary move to find out what caused the
oil stains."" a Singapore Airlines spokeswoman said. ""Rolls
Royce recommended a detailed inspection of the engines.""
 Rolls Royce shares already lost over 7 percent since the
Qantas incident, while Airbus and Qantas shares both slipped
2.5 percent each. Singapore Airlines shares were little
affected on Tuesday with the stock down 0.4 percent by 0350
GMT.
 A spokesman for Rolls Royce declined to comment.
 Experts said the Qantas investigation is pointing to a
design fault with the engine which may not be difficult to fix
but will take time.
 ""From information provided to date, it would appear to be a
design issue and not a power setting issue. Lower power
settings are not the solution,"" said Peter Marosszeky, an
aviation expert at the University of New South Wales.
 He added similar engine issues are not unknown to the
aviation industry and a fix could be relatively easy, but it
could take some time.
 ""Until then, what could happen is Airbus would allow
operators to fly the A380 on a limited basis with restrictions
on the engines,"" Marosszeky added.
 However, restriction could be a problem for Qantas, as its
routes from Los Angeles to Australia are the longest served by
the A380, and lower power limits would mean weight
restrictions, making flights less economical.
 Sources earlier told Reuters that Qantas is reviewing the
way it operates its A380s engines and whether its higher power
settings on take-off contributed to the engine failure.
 Singapore Airlines' three affected airplanes, scattered in
London, Melbourne and Sydney, are being flown back to Singapore
to be equipped with similar Rolls Royce engines.
 One of the jets took off from Sydney around 0400 GMT while
the passengers scheduled to be on the airplane are being
transferred to other flights, a Reuters reporter at the airport
said.
 Qantas is expected to give an update on its A380 fleet by
Thursday afternoon. The airline said on Monday it would ground
its six planes for at least 72 hours.
 ""We are still continuing with checks,"" a Qantas spokesman
said on Wednesday.
 On Tuesday, a Boeing 787 test flight made an emergency
landing in Texas with smoke in the cabin, the first incident of
its kind, putting additional scrutiny on the already delayed
programme.

456,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2010 11:24PM ET</span>",POSCO India plant decision postponed again-reports," NEW DELHI, Nov 10 (Reuters) - An experts' panel has
deferred by 10 days an environmental impact report into a $12
billion steel plant project by South Korea's POSCO, further
delaying India's biggest foreign direct investment, newspapers
reported on Wednesday.
 The delay means Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who is
monitoring the project as he seeks closer ties with Seoul, will
fly to the Group of 20 meeting in South Korea on Wednesday
without firm government commitment to the project.
 The delay was reported by two newspapers, the Hindustan
Times and The Times of India, without giving sources. The
environment ministry was not immediately available for comment.
 POSCO is among several companies that have come under
scrutiny from Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh, whose tough
approach has sparked criticism from businesses and even other
members of the government pushing for rapid industrialisation.
 The panel recommendation, which is not binding but is
required before Ramesh makes his final decision, was expected
to be released this week.
 The long-delayed plant in India's eastern state of Orissa
has been stalled by protests and environmental reports
spearheaded by Ramesh, who has scrapped many big-ticket
projects including some by London-listed miner Vedanta
Resources Plc.
 Prime Minister Singh is keen to forge strong political ties
with South Korea, raising the likelihood that the project will
eventually be given the go-ahead.
 The project faces a unrelated hurdle in the form of a court
case filed by a local firm against the Orissa state government,
contesting its decision to grant a mining concession to the
South Koreans, as the company had also bid for it.
 The decision on this case lies with the Supreme Court.

 * Does not believe world can return to fixed FX system
(Adds details)
 By Kevin Lim and Nopporn Wong-Anan
 SINGAPORE, Nov 10 (Reuters) - World Bank President Robert
Zoellick said on Wednesday he was not advocating a return to a
gold standard for exchange rates, but described the metal as
""the elephant in the room"" that policymakers needed to
acknowledge.
 Zoellick, who was attending an infrastructure conference
organised by the World Bank and the Singapore government, said
it was important for nations to look beyond exchange rates and
focus on economic fundamentals.
 ""I don't believe you can return to a fixed exchange rate
system and that is the gold standard,"" he later told the
Foreign Correspondents Association.""
 ""Markets are already using gold as an alternative monetary
asset because confidence is low...it is saying we have a
problem that needs to be fixed.""
 Gold prices have soared to record levels in recent weeks
and are currently around $1,400 per ounce.
 ""There is an elephant in the room and that is what I want
people to recognise,"" Zoellick said.
 Zoellick earlier this week surprised financial markets by
suggesting the world's largest nations consider gold as an
indicator to help set foreign exchange rates, amid concerns
governments and central banks may try to kickstart their
economies by devaluing their currencies.
 He said on Wednesday: ""I'm not advocating a return to the
19th century when money supply was linked to gold.""
 The former U.S. trade representative, who served in several
Republican administrations including Treasury, has said any new
system ""is likely to need to involve the dollar, the euro, the
yen, the pound and (a Chinese yuan) that moves towards
internationalisation and then an open capital account"".
 The idea drew criticism from many policymakers and
economists and there was no indication it was on the agenda for
the summit of G20 nations later this week.
 Many other pivotal issues are besetting economic
policymakers attending the meeting, including a global
framework for balanced growth and the surge of capital inflows
into developing markets.
The G20 groups Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Britain, Canada,
China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico,
Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey and the
United States.
 Zoellick said China was more likely to allow its yuan
currency to appreciate, a key demand of the United States, if
there could be an agreement on economic fundamentals.
 ""I have a long stated belief, that the renminbi should
appreciate, that you are more likely to be able to move forward
toward appreciation if you get some agreement on some of the
underlying economic fundamentals.""
 The United States has frequently criticised China, saying
it deliberately undervalues its currency to boost exports.
China says that the United States, via the Fed, is engaged in
the same practice.
 On the global economic policy debate, Zoellick said: ""We
have to move away from what sometimes has become a zero-sum
debate on rebalancing, which sometimes is described as a shift
in aggregate demand as opposed to rebuilding (and) sources of
growth.
 ""If you have healthy global growth, the currency adjustment
will be easier.""

"
458,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2010 11:00PM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Outcome of the Seoul G20 summit," SEOUL, Nov 12 (Reuters) - World leaders said they would work
to tackle global economic ""tensions and vulnerabilities"" that
have raised fears of currency wars and trade protectionism as
they wrapped up a Group of 20 summit in Seoul on Friday.
 Following is a summary of what was decided:
 GLOBAL IMBALANCES: Ironing out rifts between export-rich
countries and debt-laden consumer nations has become the G20's
cornerstone. Leaders had already agreed on a ""framework"" for
balanced growth, and submitted medium-term economic plans for IMF
review to ensure they do not clash, and the final summit
communique did not go much further.
 In Seoul, Washington had to give up on getting others to
agree to numerical targets for current account deficits and
surpluses. Instead, G20 leaders instructed their finance
ministers to draw up a set of ""indicative guidelines"" to measure
large current account imbalances, in consultation with the IMF,
but left the details to be discussed in the first half of next
year.
 CURRENCIES: Foreign exchange rates are central to the
imbalances debate. The United States and others have cajoled
China to allow its yuan currency to rise faster and accuse
Beijing of keeping it undervalued to gain a trade advantage.
 But Washington faced a tougher time making that case when
many of its allies view the Fed's easy money as a means to weaken
the dollar.
 The leaders vowed to move towards market-determined exchange
rates and shun competitive devaluations, a repeat of a commitment
made at a G20 finance ministers meeting last month.
 But, in a nod to the growing clout of developing economies
such as Brazil, G20 said those emerging economies with
increasingly overvalued exchange rates that face an undue burden
of adjustment would be justified in taking ""carefully designed
macro-prudential measures"" -- code for capital controls -- to
counter capital inflows.
 At previous G20 summits, leaders have haggled over whether to
include a line in the closing statement singling out China for
keeping its currency undervalued, but once again this did not
happen.
 FINANCIAL REGULATION: World leaders signed off on a ""Basel
III"" agreement to raise the quality and quantity of bank capital,
the centrepiece of their reforms following the financial crisis.
They also be endorsed of the Financial Stability Board's
proposals to tighten supervision of the over-the-counter
derivatives market and reduce reliance on credit rating agencies.
 However, they did not significantly advance the rest of their
regulation agenda.
 The G20 endorsed a series of broad recommendations by the
Financial Stability Board to regulate banks judged ""too big to
fail"" but, with disagreement over issues such as whether such
institutions should be subject to further capital surcharges,
said more work needed to be done on devising specific measures.
 TRADE: Slow-growing advanced economies all want to export
their way to economic health, which is the root of the tensions
over currencies and imbalances. Leaders made broad pledges not to
pursue protectionist policies and to work towards concluding the
long-stalled Doha round of trade liberalisation talks.
 In a blow for the hosts, South Korea and the United States
failed to seal a long-stalled free trade agreement, mainly due to
disagreement over access for U.S. carmakers to the lucrative
South Korean automobile market.
 IMF
 Leaders endorsed a package of reforms thrashed out by their
finance ministers last month to reform the International Monetary
Fund to reflect a shift in the balance of global economic power.
 Under the deal, more than 6 percent of voting shares at the
Fund will shift to dynamic developing countries such as China,
which will become the third-biggest member of the 187-strong
Washington-based lender.

 * Euro support at $1.3735 holds, rebounds but soft
 * NZD hit by dovish central bank comments
 * BoE inflation report key for sterling
 By Ian Chua and Charlotte Cooper
 SYDNEY/TOKYO, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The dollar's sharp rebound
paused on Wednesday as the greenback faltered at significant
chart resistance levels and precious metals, which had fallen
sharply and given it a boost, began to recover.
 The euro, which lost 1 percent on Tuesday as euro zone debt
concerns pressured it, twice bounced off support at $1.3735
although its recovery was limited, while the dollar failed to
push through a significant barrier at 82.00 yen.
 One dealer said the greenback ran into selling by a
short-term player as it neared 82.00 yen, with Japanese exporter
sell orders lined up at that level and above also expected to
prove a hurdle to its rebound.
 Still, it has recovered close to important chart levels which
could indicate a sharper comeback if they give way. The euro has
key support at $1.3700, with a break there opening up the
possibility of a test down to $1.3365.
 ""If you look at the last few days, the dollar has gained some
traction,"" said Mitul Kotecha, global head of FX strategy at
Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.
 ""It seems like a credible bounce back. I don't see it going
too far but it shows you how short the market was.""
 Longer-dated U.S. Treasury bond yields jumped on Tuesday and
the market will be watching an auction of 30-year debt later on
Wednesday to see if demand is lean.
 ""The ultimate theme of the market is U.S. interest rates,""
said a trader at a Japanese bank. ""If U.S. bond yields rise
further after today's auction the dollar could see more upside.""
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance
against a basket of major currencies, rose as high as 77.88 -- a
level not seen since Oct. 28.
 It was last at 77.80 and faces major resistance in the
78.27-36 band, where a break would signal its fall has bottomed
out at least for the near term. Support lies at 77.30-40.
 The euro fell as low as $1.3735, down almost 4
percent from last week's peak around $1.4283. It edged back to
$1.3755, down 0.2 percent on the day in highly choppy trading
which also saw it gain as far as $1.3794.
 A near-term risk for the euro is a Portuguese government bond
auction later on Wednesday.
 Portugal, seen by markets as a possible candidate for a
Greek-style bailout, is scheduled to sell up to 1.25 billion
euros ($1.72 billion) of government debt.
 The premium investors demand to hold Irish and Portuguese
debt over benchmark German bunds has blown out to euro lifetime
highs and traders said the European Central Bank was again
forced to step in on Monday to calm the market.
 ""The euro chart is not looking pretty. A rise in U.S. yields
is undermining the euro and now we have Ireland and Portugal
issues. The euro does not have positive factors on its own,"" the
Japanese bank trader said.
 Part of the dollar's climb on Tuesday came from a vicious
reversal in silver, which rippled through the commodity sector.
Investors have been borrowing in dollars to fund leveraged
positions and the pullback in prices forced some to liquidate
positions and buy back the currency.
 Gold and silver were both edging up on Wednesday although the
rebound lost a bit of steam.
 Feeding into investor caution was data showing China's
exports and imports grew slightly less than expected in October,
while comments by an adviser to China's central bank that it
should shift its monetary policy stance to ""prudent"" from
appropriately loose next year weighed on the Australian dollar.
 The Aussie, which briefly dipped below parity on Tuesday,
eased slightly to $1.0029, down about 2 percent from a 28-year
peak above $1.0180 set this month.
 The New Zealand dollar, which fell 1.3 percent on Tuesday,
was further hit by dovish comments by Reserve Bank of New Zealand
Governor Alan Bollard, who said the strength of the local dollar
could limit future interest rate rises.
 Already weighed down by media reports of a U.S. ban on New
Zealand's kiwi fruit vines, the NZ dollar fell 0.3 percent to
$0.7755, down 3 percent from a 31-month high
near $0.7980 set last week.
 A move by a Chinese credit ratings agency to cut the U.S.
sovereign credit rating underscored growing tension between
Beijing and Washington over economic policy ahead of a Group of
20 leaders summit on Thursday and Friday in Seoul.
 Sterling was steady after breaching support at $1.6000 to
stand at $1.5984. Sterling's near-term fortunes hinge on a Bank
of England inflation report due at 1030 GMT.
 Markets are still betting the central bank may eventually
expand its 200 billion pound ($320 billion) asset purchase
programme, although recently firm data have reduced expectations
of such a move.

 By Langi Chiang and Kevin Yao
 BEIJING, Nov 10 (Reuters) - China's politically contentious
trade surplus widened in October, lending fresh ammunition for
foreign critics of its currency policy ahead of a G20 summit.
 China's exports rose 22.9 percent in October from a year
earlier, and imports increased by 25.3 percent, the official
Xinhua News Agency said on Wednesday.
 That left the country with a trade surplus of $27.1 billion,
compared with a surplus of $16.9 in September.
 ""The numbers are volatile from month to month -- it might be
a bit embarrassing for the Chinese government ahead of the G20
for the trade surplus to bounce like that,"" said David Cohen,
economist at Action Economics in Singapore.
 The announcement of the surplus coincided with heated debate
on global exchange rate polices in the run-up to a Group of 20
major economices summit in Seoul this week. [ID:nN09125341]
 The United States has frequently criticised China, saying it
deliberately undervalues its currency to boost exports.
 In return, China has pointed its finger at the Federal
Reserve's new $600 billion bond-buying programme, saying the
ultra-loose policy is putting pressure on the dollar and will
result in a flood of cash flowing into the world economy,
inflating asset bubbles.
 China's trade surplus for 2010 is likely to reach around $180
billion, smaller than last year's $196 billion, Vice Commerce
Minister Zhong Shan said on Nov 6. [ID:nTOE6A500L]
 China has yielded some ground on the currency, allowing the
yuan  to gain 2.85 percent since its depegging to the
dollar in mid-June.
 WEAKENING DEMAND
 The slower-than-expected import growth could indicate
softening domestic demand as the government wound down its
massive economic stimulus unveiled in late 2008.
 The median forecast of economists polled by Reuters last week
was for exports to rise 23.5 percent and imports to grow 28.5
percent, resulting in a trade surplus of $25 billion.
[ID:nTOE6A305D]
 ""Import growth in October was weaker than expected, producing
the big trade surplus. Import data usually fluctuates a lot, but
the figure also showed that domestic demand in the second half is
weak,"" said Gao Shanwen, chief economist with Essence Securities
in Beijing.
""In the next two months, import growth will trend up while
export growth will slow. The trade surplus will remain high,
bringing pressure on yuan appreciation.

 * APEC discusses vast free trade area for region
 * Japanese farmers vow to oppose U.S.-led trade initiative
 By Yoko Nishikawa
 YOKOHAMA Japan, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Japan on Wednesday urged
Asia-Pacific economies to trade more openly as a way to lift the
global economy, but immediately faced protests at home from
farmers worried their livelihoods would vanish in the process.
 Foreign and trade ministers from the 21-member Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum began talks in Yokohama, south
of Tokyo, on creating a vast free trade area that would link the
world's three biggest economies -- the United States, China and
Japan-- and some of its fastest-growing emerging markets.
 ""We need to further promote regional economic integration,
which is an important challenge for APEC, and improve the quality
of growth to seek sustainable growth in the region. APEC can
contribute to the global economy by doing so,"" Japanese Foreign
Minister Seiji Maehara said at the start of talks on Wednesday.
 The ministers are meeting ahead of a G20 summit of rich and
emerging economies in Seoul on Thursday and Friday, where leaders
will seek to soothe deep tensions over global economic imbalances
and competitive currency devaluations.
 Security tensions are also simmering ahead of the APEC summit
in Yokohama on Nov.13-14. Much of the region is wary of a newly
aggressive China, and Japan is locked in territorial feuds with
Beijing and Moscow.
 Besides pondering a future Free Trade Area of the
Asia-Pacific (FTAAP), the APEC ministers are expected to express
concern about trade protectionism and again declare their support
for the long-stalled Doha round of trade liberalisation talks.
 ""I would like to take one step further toward achieving a
FTAAP in Yokohama. To achieve a higher quality of growth, I would
like to compile an economic growth strategy with you to promote
economic policy harmony and cooperation in the region,"" Japanese
Trade Minister Akihiro Ohata said in an opening speech.
 Calls to revive the Doha round have been a feature of the
APEC meetings for years.
 ""I think APEC also needs to discuss how it can play a role in
strengthening a multilateral trade system through promoting the
WTO's Doha Round negotiations and in continuing to prevent
protectionism,"" Ohata said.
 Even as Ohata spoke in Yokohama, thousands of Japanese
farmers rallied back in Tokyo to demand their government steer
clear of a U.S.-led free trade initiative which would open the
heavily protected sector to fierce competition.
 They were joined by 140 lawmakers from ruling and opposition
parties, most of them -- like the farmers -- wearing headbands
saying ""Total opposition to the TPP!"".
 Japan has said it would start talks with other countries
about the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a U.S. initiative, but
stopped short of pledging to join formal negotiations due to
ruling party worries about damage to politically powerful
farmers.
 ""At this point in time, the Japanese government has no grand
design or anything for the farm sector, and if TPP becomes a
reality, there will be no more farming in Japan,"" Kiyoshi Ishii,
chairman of an agricultural cooperative, told Reuters at the
protest, where some 2,700 people gathered under blue skies.
 Japanese business lobbies have urged Prime Minister Naoto Kan
to make clear his intention to join TPP talks when leaders of the
Asia-Pacific Cooperation (APEC) gather in Yokohama, south of
Tokyo, on Nov. 13-14 to discuss a vision of a broad regional free
trade area that would link the fast-growing region.
 Japanese companies are eager for Tokyo to join the pact,
warning that their goods will lose competitiveness and jobs move
overseas if the country is left out of the deal.
 The TPP started as a trade pact between Singapore, New
Zealand, Chile and Brunei, who have since been joined in talks by
Australia, Peru, Vietnam, Malaysia, and the United States. It
would in principle eliminate all tariffs within the zone.
 There is no formal deadline for completing talks, but
supporters hope for a deal by the time that Obama hosts the
annual APEC leaders summit in Hawaii in November 2011.

 SINGAPORE, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose
marginally on Wednesday to hit its highest levels since late

extended its losses over worries about euro zone sovereign

 The dollar's strength boosted exporters in Japan, helping
to push the Nikkei average up to a four-month high, while gold

 Japanese banks also pushed the Nikkei higher on hopes they

their domestic focus. Mizuho Financial Group <8411.T> soared
5.9 percent.
 Japan's stock market has struggled to break decisively

grounded

failure

 By Harry Suhartono and Balazs Koranyi
 SINGAPORE/SYDNEY, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines
will replace engines on three of its Airbus A380 planes after
finding oil stains on them, almost a week after Australian
rival Qantas grounded its A380 fleet due to an engine failure.
 Qantas's six A380s have been grounded since Thursday, when
a Rolls-Royce engine partly disintegrated mid-flight, forcing
the fully laden Airbus A380 to make an emergency landing in the
biggest incident to date for the world's largest passenger jet.
 Investigations into that incident have focused on oil leaks
inside the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines, the same model used
to power Singapore Airlines' and German Lufthansa's A380 fleet.
Lufthansa said on Wednesday its A380 flights were on schedule.
 But Singapore Airlines stressed the problems on three of
its 11 A380s were precautionary and unrelated as the oil stains
were different from the oil leakage in the Qantas turbines.
 Singapore's findings may deal a fresh blow to Rolls-Royce,
which moved on Monday to contain a crisis of confidence, saying
it was making progress in understanding what caused last week's
blowout on the Qantas A380 flight.
 ""This is a precautionary move to find out what caused the
oil stains."" a Singapore Airlines spokeswoman said.
""Rolls-Royce recommended a detailed inspection of the engines.""
 Asked if Singapore Airlines was confident the engine maker
had identified the cause of the problem, CEO Chew Choon Seng
told reporters: ""I'm quite assured at the highest level that
Rolls Royce is doing all that it takes to get to that point.""
 Singapore Airlines said later its other Airbus A380
aircraft were still in service, but could not rule out further
engine changes. It said the engines on the affected aircraft
would be swapped in two days.
 ""At this stage there is no indication that more engines on
our A380 aircraft will need to have precautionary engine
changes carried out, but I would certainly not rule it out,""
airline spokeswoman Bryony Duncan-Smith told Australian radio.
 INVESTIGATION FOCUSES ON DESIGN FAULT
 Rolls-Royce shares have already lost more than 7 percent
since the Qantas incident, while Airbus and Qantas shares both
slipped 2.5 percent each. Singapore Airlines shares closed 1.2
percent lower on Wednesday.
 A spokesman for Rolls-Royce declined to comment.
 Experts said the Qantas investigation is pointing to a
design fault with the engine which may not be difficult to fix
but will take time.
 ""From information provided to date, it would appear to be a
design issue and not a power setting issue. Lower power
settings are not the solution,"" said Peter Marosszeky, an
aviation expert at the University of New South Wales.
 He added similar engine issues are not unknown to the
aviation industry and a fix could be relatively easy, but it
could take some time.
 ""Until then, what could happen is Airbus would allow
operators to fly the A380 on a limited basis with restrictions
on the engines,"" Marosszeky added.
 However, restriction could be a problem for Qantas, as its
routes from Los Angeles to Australia are the longest served by
the A380, and lower power limits would mean weight
restrictions, making flights less economical.
 Sources earlier told Reuters Qantas is reviewing the way it
operates its A380s engines and whether its higher power
settings on take-off contributed to the engine failure.
 Singapore Airlines' three affected airplanes, scattered in
London, Melbourne and Sydney, are being flown back to Singapore
to be equipped with similar Rolls-Royce engines.
 Chief Executive Chew told a media and analysts conference
that the aircraft should arrive in the city-state on Wednesday
evening and there were enough replacement engines available to
carry out the swap.
 Qantas is expected to give an update on its A380 fleet by
Thursday afternoon. The airline said on Monday it would ground
its six planes for at least 72 hours.
 ""We are still continuing with checks,"" a Qantas spokesman
said on Wednesday.
 On Tuesday, a Boeing 787 test flight made an emergency
landing in Texas with smoke in the cabin, the first incident of
its kind, putting additional scrutiny on the already delayed
programme.

(Adds report on draft communique)
 By Patricia Zengerle and Alister Bull
 SEOUL, Nov 10 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama sought to
swing the G20 spotlight back onto global imbalances and take his
own country's policies out of the glare as world leaders gathered
in Seoul on Wednesday.
 An early G20 draft statement cited by Dow Jones Newswires
echoed an earlier finance ministers' pledge to move towards more
market-determined currency rates and appeared to offer no new
proposals on how to ease tensions between struggling rich nations
and new economic powers such as China or Brazil.
 Obama, facing widespread criticism of U.S. easy-money policy
as he arrived for the two-day Group of 20 leaders summit, said a
strong U.S. economy was vital to the global recovery and urged
his G20 counterparts to put aside their differences and do their
part to bolster growth.
 ""When all nations do their part -- emerging no less than
advanced, surplus no less than deficit -- we all benefit from
higher growth,"" Obama said in a letter sent to G20 leaders on
Tuesday. A copy was obtained by Reuters on Wednesday.
 The bridge building came after a day of heated arguments as
negotiators struggled to hammer out a closing statement that all
G20 leaders could sign. Deep divisions have emerged over economic
policy, particularly the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision last
week to spend another $600 billion buying government bonds.
 Critics charge the Fed's policy weakens the dollar to the
detriment of other nations, but Obama said the dollar's strength
ultimately rests on the strength of the U.S. economy.
 Deputies clutching mobile phones to their ears shuttled in
and out of a hall as they tried to draft a final statement, to be
released on Friday, but remained far apart on pivotal issues,
including currency exchange rates, G20 spokesman Kim Yoon Kyung
said.
 ""We had to open the door because the debate was so animated
and the room was getting hot,"" he said, referring to day-long
talks on Tuesday.
 The Dow Jones report said that while an early draft repeated
the finance ministers' pledge to ""refrain from competitive
devaluations"" from two weeks ago, it also included an alternative
language on avoiding ""competitive undervaluation.""
 An Indian official close to the negotiations said discussions
on reducing current account imbalances were ""picking up"" after a
rocky start.
 ""SHARED GROWTH"" SLOGAN
 Group of 20 leaders had hoped this week's gathering, the
fifth since the financial crisis exploded in 2008, would mark the
beginning of a new era of global cooperation. Hosts South Korea
printed banners proclaiming a slogan of ""Shared Growth Beyond
Crisis.""
 But the unity forged in crisis has given way to diverging
national policies that reflect a multi-speed recovery from the
recession, prompting critics to question the effectiveness of the
G20 grouping itself.
 In his G20 letter, Obama sought to return the discussion to
global imbalances and insisted that the United States was not the
only country that must change its ways.
 ""Just as the United States must change, so too must those
economies that have previously relied on exports to offset
weaknesses in their own demand,"" he wrote in a thinly veiled
reference to China.
 Most major economies are grappling with sub-par growth,
leaving them reliant on exports, while emerging powers such as
China and Brazil have roared back to pre-recession strength.
 China's politically contentious trade surplus widened to
$27.1 billion in October, more than economists had expected,
according to trade figures released on Wednesday. U.S. trade
figures, due later on Wednesday, were expected to show a wide gap
for September. (For a graphic: http://link.reuters.com/rup64q)
 A Chinese official who has been helping draft the G20
communique said the leaders should not discuss the yuan or any
other currency specifically. The Indian official said the final
statement would not single out any currency.
 However, the yuan rose to a high of 6.6353 against the dollar
in the spot market on Wednesday, the highest level since the
currency's revaluation in July 2005, after the People's Bank of
China fixed a record yuan mid-point.
 Beijing typically loosens its tight grip on the yuan as a
goodwill gesture ahead of political events that apply pressure on
China for more yuan appreciation.
 The United States got some support from close ally Britain.
Finance Minister George Osborne said a strong U.S. economy was in
the best interest of Asia and the world, echoing Obama.
 Security was tight in Seoul, with police and armed forces on
high alert, but there have been no big demonstrations so far. Two
small protests, against a free trade deal with the United States,
and tax reform in South Korea, were staged on Wednesday morning.

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Investors pulled away from
speculative bets late on Tuesday, roiling U.S. stock and
commodities markets and pushing the dollar higher.
 Gold fell 1.14 percent after touching record highs earlier
in the day and silver dropped by 3 percent after hitting a
30-year high. Gold typically falls when the dollar strengthens,
and vice versa, as a firmer U.S. currency curbs the metal's
appeal as an alternative asset.
 U.S. government debt prices dropped as investors were
uncertain about demand for Wednesday's $16 billion auction of
30-year bonds.
 ""The markets in general are severely overbought and
something has to give,"" Troy Buckner, managing principal of
hedge fund NuWave Investment Management LLC of Morristown, New
Jersey.
 Investors fear the Federal Reserve's decision to undertake
more stimulus by printing more money to buy $600 billion in
U.S. bonds, will lead to high inflation.
 In addition, markets worry that low interest rates in the
United States risk fueling asset bubbles in other countries and
destabilizing currencies.
 Heavily indebted countries such as Ireland, Portugal and
Spain were back in the headlines, with the cost of protecting
their government debt against default rising substantially in
the past week.
 The renewed concerns weighed on the euro , which hit
its lowest in nearly two weeks versus the dollar. It was last
trading down 1.07 percent at $1.3772.
 The dollar was up against a basket currencies, with the
U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> rising almost 1 percent at 77.743.
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  rose 1 percent at
81.98.
 U.S. equities fell, led by sharp losses in bank and
precious metal stocks.
 An index of gold and silver miners' shares <.XAU> fell 2.6
percent after hitting an all-time high earlier in the day.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 60.09
points, or 0.53 percent, at 11,346.75. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was down 9.85 points, or 0.81 percent, at
1,213.40. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 17.07
points, or 0.66 percent, at 2,562.98.
 The December futures contract for the Nikkei 225 stock
index <0#NK:> trading in Chicago rose 20 points to 9,745.
 European shares <.FTEU3> shrugged off euro zone debt
concerns to close at their highest level in more than two years
with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares up 0.6 percent at 1,117.46 points, its highest close
since September 2008.
 The MSCI all-country world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS>
eased 0.17 percent. Emerging market stocks <.MSCIEF> were up
0.04 percent.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices fell after an auction of the
benchmark notes and ahead of the sale of 30-year bonds on
Wednesday.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 29/32, with the yield at 2.6613 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was down 3/32, with the yield at
0.4427 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was
down 2-1/32 in price, with the yield at 4.2505 percent.
 ""Bonds are selling off due to both inflationary fears
(commodity market bubbles), the idea that maybe the Fed won't
buy as many bonds, and due to the euro sovereign debt issues
resurfacing,"" Buckner at NuWave Investment Management said.
 Spot gold prices  fell $16.05, or 1.14 percent, to
$1,393.00 from an all-time high touched earlier at $1,420.90 an
ounce, while silver  fell 3 percent to $26.80 after
touching a 30-year high of $29.33 an ounce.
 U.S. crude oil  fell 34 cents, or 0.39 percent, to
$86.40 per barrel, after touching $87.63, its highest since
October 2008.

 * Proposals recommend changes, but do not scrap socialism
 * Experts see good first step but say wider changes needed
(Recasts, adds quotes)
 By Esteban Israel
 HAVANA, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Cuba's ruling Communist Party
will tinker with the island's socialist system at a party
congress in April, but its underlying task is to ensure the
system's survival when the current, aging leaders are gone.
 Whether the proposed changes detailed in a document
released by President Raul Castro on Monday will be sufficient
to achieve that goal remains an open question.
 The 32-page ""Guidelines of Economic and Social Policy"" that
will guide the congress paints a picture of a future in which
Cuba promotes foreign investment, expands the private sector
and dutifully pays off its debts.
 But it also makes clear that all reforms will come in the
context of the socialist system installed half a century ago
after Fidel Castro took power in a 1959 revolution.
 ""The economic policy in the new phase will correspond with
the principle that only socialism is capable of overcoming
difficulties and preserving the gains of the revolution, and
that in the updating of the economic model, planning will be
paramount, not the market."" it said.
 President Castro has already begun a number of the proposed
reforms, including his groundbreaking announcement in September
that the government will trim half a million jobs from its
payrolls by March and issue 250,000 self-employment licenses.
 His overarching goal is make the island's troubled economy
solid and self-sustaining by increasing productivity and
reducing state expenditures.
 The proposals before the party congress include the
elimination of the monthly food ration Cubans receive, a symbol
of decades of state paternalism and a particular target of Raul
Castro, who says handouts have discouraged productivity.
 There are provisions for bank credits for the newly
self-employed, but also provisions that require them to pay
taxes to finance public spending.
 FOREIGN INVESTMENT
 And the authorities will look to improve the country's
international credibility ""through the strict fulfillment of
contract commitments.""
 Cuba's standing with the international business community
has been damaged over the past two years as a cash crunch
forced the freezing of Cuban bank accounts held by foreign
businesses and of payments to many of them.
 The guidelines propose ""to continue encouraging the
participation of foreign capital in Cuba, complementing
national investment in those activities of interest to the
country.""
 The document mentions, for example, the development of golf
courses, marinas and luxury condominiums to attract wealthier
visitors to the Caribbean island.
 The changes are significant for Cuba, which is one of the
world's last Communist countries, but many experts say greater
economic opening may be needed to achieve Castro's goals.
 ""What they are talking about now is a good first step, but
ultimately it seems like they will have to open their economy
more like China and Vietnam have for socialism to work,"" said a
diplomat based in Havana.
 Before that, said another, Cuba needs to fill gaps in its
economic infrastructure to have a shot at success.
 ""They don't have many factories, they don't have money,
they don't have training. They'll need all of that and more to
make a go of it,"" the diplomat said.
 The congress is where Cuba's only legal political party
sets direction for the country, supposedly for the next five
years, although it last met in 1997.
 The April gathering is particularly important because it
will be the last for the generation that fought the revolution
and has held on to power, hewing hard to communist ideology.
 President Castro, 79, took office in 2008 after older
brother Fidel Castro, 84, ruled the island for 49 years and
finally resigned due to ill health. The elder Castro remains
head of the Communist party.
 There has been little discussion in Cuba of political
reform to accompany economic changes. Cuban expert Arturo
Lopez-Levy, at the University of Denver, said ""there is not a
crisis of governability in Cuba"" because the Communist party
has no serious rival.
But he said the party could become its own worst enemy if it
is too rigid. ""If the Communist Party has an enemy over the
long term, it's the force of some of its dogmas and
convictions,"" he said.

(Updates prices, adds comment)
 By Julie Haviv and Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rallied broadly
on Tuesday as debt risks in the euro zone's periphery weighed
on the euro and as U.S. bond yields jumped.
 The euro fell for a third straight session to a near
two-week low as investors worried about Irish and Portuguese
debt amid widening government bond spreads relative to Bunds.
The dollar gained as Treasury yields, which move inversely
to price, rose as higher U.S. bond yields make
dollar-denominated assets more attractive.
 ""I think it's led by the longer end of the Treasury curve
right now. It's really squeezing out a lot of the dollar
shorts, especially in the majors,"" said Mike Moran, senior
currency strategist at Standard Chartered in New York.
 ""More broadly, I think the markets are slowly, but surely
showing signs of Fed fatigue with all this talk of QE2. It's
been the only game in town for the last month or two,"" he said.
""We're starting to see this market shift back to this
eurocentric focus.""
 The euro last changed hands down 1.1 percent at $1.3774
after hitting a session low of $1.3751 on trading platform
EBS.
 Traders said an earlier slide below the 76.4 percent
retracement of a recent rally that peaked last week near $1.43
suggested it could fall as far as $1.3697 in the days ahead.
 Some analysts said comments from New Zealand Reserve Bank
Governor Alan Bollard also contributed to a sell-off in riskier
currencies and boosted the dollar. Bollard said financial
markets were interpreting NZ data more strongly than the
central bank had done.
 ""The last buying in the U.S dollar seems to have been
triggered by those Bollard comments out of New Zealand,"" said
John McCarthy, director of foreign exchange trading at ING
Capital Markets in New York.
 ""Those comments prompted selling of NZD, and other
commodity currencies, and then sterling and then the euro. That
tripped all the stop-losses on the way down for these
currencies,"" he added.
 The euro was down 0.3 percent at 112.59 yen while the
dollar rose 0.7 percent to 81.74 yen. Traders said the next key
resistance level for dollar/yen is 82, which is likely to
attract offers from Japanese exporters.
 Kathy Lien, director of research at GFT Forex in New York,
said investors were booking profits on their short dollar
positions, with moves exacerbated after the euro took out stops
at $1.3860 and $1.3800 and sterling broke through $1.60.
 ""With the Fed having announced more easing and some people
looking to take profits, it wouldn't be hard to see very choppy
trading for the rest of the year,"" she said.
 The cost of protecting government debt against default in
Ireland and Portugal has risen in the past week, although it
eased ahead of a Portuguese bond auction.
 RISK SELLOFF
 A Chinese credit rating agency Tuesday cut its rating on
the United States, citing doubts about the U.S. ability to
repay its debts, though the move had little impact on the
dollar.
 The major ratings agencies still give the United States the
top rating of AAA, although some have warned about pressures
from the rising debt burden on the rating's longer-term
outlook.
citing heavy selling from ""a U.S. investment house,"" while the
Australian dollar lost 1 percent at $1.0035, moving away from
its recent 28-year high at $1.0183. The New Zealand dollar was
down 1.3 percent at US$0.7772.
 Low interest rates in developed countries have stoked
demand for higher-yielding currencies and assets from
fast-growing emerging market economies.
 Emerging governments say this causes inflation in their
economies, and some have tried to stem foreign money inflows.
Analysts said that means investors should be wary of a sudden
pullback in high-yielding emerging market assets.
 Traders said some macro accounts and commodity trading
advisers, who are short-term players, were already closing
their long euro and short dollar forward and futures positions
ahead of their book closing at the end of this month or next.
 The dollar index was up 0.9 percent at 77.743, but
Citigroup said charts are ""highlighting the risk of a bounce,
possibly as far as 79.31, the 200-day moving average.""

 NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - A Chinese credit ratings agency
downgraded the United States' sovereign credit rating on
Tuesday, citing the Federal Reserve's controversial move last
week to pump more dollars into the U.S. economy.
 As Beijing and Washington locked horns on economic policy
ahead of a Group of 20 leaders summit this week, the Dagong
Global Credit Rating Co. Ltd cut the U.S. local and foreign
currency long-term sovereign credit rating to A-plus from AA.
 The ratings agency, which warned it might cut the U.S.
ratings further, said its move reflected the United States'
""deteriorating debt repayment capability and drastic decline of
the government's intention of debt repayment.""
 Tensions over economic policies between the United States
and China have been revived by the U.S. central bank's decision
last week to pump an extra $600 billion into the country's
struggling economy which has further weakened the U.S. dollar.
For details, [ID:nN03287174]
 ""The serious defects in the United States economic
development and management model will lead to the long-term
recession of its national economy, fundamentally lowering the
national solvency,"" Dagong said on its website.
 The Fed's move represented a deepening of the U.S. credit
crisis, it said.
 ""Such a move entirely encroaches on the interests of the
creditors, indicating the decline of the U.S. government's
intention of debt repayment,"" Dagong said in an
English-language statement.
 The downgrade had no discernible impact on the price of
U.S. government debt.
 The United States is rated Aaa by Moodys and AAA by
Standard & Poor's and Fitch, their highest ratings grade.
 Joseph Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX Solutions in
Saddle River, New Jersey, said the announcement by Dagong
appeared to be politically motivated ahead of the G20 summit.
 ""The Chinese government has interest on opinions on topics
like this which are expressed by ostensibly private
institutions,"" he said. ""So it's hard to believe such an
opinion does not reflect at least partial approval by the
Chinese government.""
 Dagong's analysis was not complete ""but some of the points
they raise are true,"" said Herbert Kaufman, professor emeritus
of the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State
University. ""It is not clear the policy tools used will be
sufficient"" to stimulate the U.S. economy.
 Kaufman emphasized, however, that Dagong's analysis failed
to take into account the United States' historical ability and
responsibility to repay debt.
 ""Either they don't appreciate it or they don't want to
appreciate it,"" he said.
 According to its website, Dagong Global Credit Rating Co
Ltd is a specialized credit rating and risk analysis research
institution founded in 1994 upon the joint approval of People's
Bank of China and the former State Economic & Trade Commission,
People's Republic of China.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The euro lost value against the
U.S. dollar for a third straight session on Tuesday as debt
risks grew in the periphery of the euro zone, spilling over
into foreign exchange markets and driving up the greenback.
 The euro gyrated between gains and losses as investors
worried about Irish and Portuguese debt and continued to hedge
sizable bets against the U.S. dollar. Widening government bond
spreads relative to bunds in the peripheral euro-area continued
to weigh on the single European currency.
 ""The problems in the euro zone that emerged this past
spring were never really addressed, and now they are coming
back to the surface,"" said Marc Chandler, global head of
currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 ""The foreign exchange market is only capable of focusing on
one thing at a time,"" he said. ""So during the time when the
focus was on the U.S. and Fed easing, problems were already
smoldering in Europe.""
 The euro last changed hands at $1.3835 , down 0.6
percent. Traders said an earlier slide below the 76.4 percent
retracement of a recent rally that peaked last week near $1.43
suggested it could fall as far as $1.3697 in the days ahead.
 Chandler said the euro will remain under pressure and
expects it to end the year in the $1.33 area.
 The euro hit its recent high after the U.S. Federal Reserve
said it would buy $600 billion of Treasuries by mid-2011 to
lower interest rates and reinvigorate a sluggish U.S. economy.
 The cost of protecting government debt against default in
Ireland and Portugal has risen in the past week, although it
eased ahead of a Portuguese bond auction. For details, see
[ID:nLDE6A8169]
 Irish debt came under pressure this week on fear the
government won't be able to cut spending as much as planned
next year, which could complicate efforts to sell fresh debt.

 A Chinese credit rating agency Tuesday cut its rating on
the United States, citing doubts about the U.S. ability to
repay its debts, though the move had little impact on the
dollar. The major ratings agencies still give the United States
the top rating of AAA, although some have warned about
pressures from the rising debt burden on the rating's
longer-term outlook.

 RISK TRADE GETTING LONG IN THE TOOTH
 The euro was little changed at 112.92 yen  while
the dollar rose 0.7 percent to 81.69 yen .
 Traders said rising U.S. bond yields helped lift the
dollar/yen. The U.S. 30-year Treasury bond yield rose above its
200-day moving average of 4.20 percent for the first time since
May. [ID:nNYD003725]
 Sterling also fell 0.7 percent to $1.6023 , with
traders citing heavy selling from ""a U.S. investment house,""
while the Australian dollar was down 0.5 percent at $1.0074
, still near a 28-year high at $1.0183.
 Low interest rates in developed countries have stoked
demand for higher-yielding currencies and assets from
fast-growing emerging market economies.
 Emerging governments say this causes inflation in their
economies, and some have tried to stem foreign money inflows.
 Analysts said that means investors should be wary of a
sudden pullback in high-yielding emerging market assets.
 Traders said some macro accounts and commodity trading
advisers, who are short-term players, were already closing
their long euro and short dollar forward and futures positions
ahead of their book closing at the end of this month or next.
 Such a pullback in risk occurred last November, and
Citigroup technical strategists said the a similar ""momentum
divergence"" on dollar index charts suggests a rerun of that
move may be in store.
 The dollar index <.DXY> was up 0.6 percent Tuesday at
77.475, but Citi said charts are ""highlighting the risk of a

 * EU may deny public tenders to third countries
 * EU importers warn EU threats may yield few results
 
 Bu Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The European Union said on
Tuesday it aimed to punish countries that hoard raw materials
and energy resources or restrict access to bidding for public
works contracts as part of its new long-term trade strategy.
 But the policy statement left vague what form the
restrictions might take, which drew criticism from industry and
EU diplomats.
 Unveiling the strategy, the EU's executive Commission
promised it would be assertive about securing access to foreign
markets and scarce natural resources, as part of a plan to help
the EU battle the economic crisis.
 The policy announcement was a shot across the bows of
emerging economic powers who have so far shrugged off EU
demands, but was also aimed at reassuring Europeans worried
about losing production and jobs to increased globalisation.
 It also addresses growing fears about global supply
shortages of raw materials from alloys to timber and minerals --
an issue that has emerged since the EU launched its last
long-term trade strategy in 2006.
 ""I am proposing a greater focus on enforcement, using all
appropriate means to stand up for our rights,"" said European
trade commissioner Karel De Gucht.
 ""Europe rejects protectionism,"" he told reporters.
 Legislation due to be proposed by mid-2011 could deny EU
public works contracts to countries that don't allow European
firms to bid in their public tenders.
 Canada, Brazil, Argentina, the United States and China are
among the EU's major trading partners that keep such lucrative
contracts -- from heavy construction to major infrastructure
projects -- reserved for local contractors.
 ""We have a broad understanding ... whereby we can react to
third countries when they don't effectively open their public
procurement markets to us,"" De Gucht said. 
 ""I don't believe that bluntly closing our procurement
markets would be a good idea but it should be sectoral, specific
and aimed at practices we cannot accept from third countries.""
 De Gucht said Europe would clamp down on countries that
restrict exports of raw materials and rare earths, commodities
that are critical to EU output and growth.
 ""We have to insist with the Chinese that they keep the
markets open ... and on the other hand we should also reopen our
deposits,"" he said.
 
 WHIFF OF COLONIALISM
 Industry experts and diplomats were unimpressed.
 ""How exactly are rules on public procurement supposed to
work? You can't just go beyond your borders and tell other
countries what to do,"" said Stefan Wengler, director at the
Foreign Trade Association, which represents European retailers
and importers.
 ""It's not really helpful to be wagging one's finger like
that, telling other countries the right way to do things. It has
a whiff of colonialism,"" Wengler said.
 EU diplomats who declined to be named said Tuesday's legal
threats could alienate major trading powers.
 Members of the WTO should negotiate new rules on export
restrictions to address raw materials shortages, Andre Sapir, a
senior fellow at Brussels think tank Bruegel, told Reuters.
 ""One needs to come to an agreement within the framework of
the WTO about improving the existing rules on export
restrictions in general, including for raw material.""

(Updates with European stocks' close)
 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Gold surged to another record
and oil rose to a two-year high on Tuesday, driven by inflation
expectations even as the dollar rebounded against the euro.
 The Federal Reserve's decision to undertake more stimulus
by printing more money to buy $600 billion in U.S. bonds has
hit the dollar of late, leading many to worry about inflation.
 Commodities, which are priced in dollars, benefit from the
weakness of the U.S. currency.
 With an economy that is growing at just a 2 percent
annualized clip and an unemployment rate that remains stuck at
9.6 percent, the Fed decided to flood more dollars into the
financial markets to boost the anemic recovery.
 Investors fear the Fed's policy will lead to high inflation
and worry that low interest rates in the United States risk
fueling asset bubbles in other countries and destabilizing
currencies.
 ""We have a combination: inflation fears, currency market
uncertainty, fears about the financial strength of some
countries,"" said Alexander Zumpfe of Heraeus Metals.
 Heavily indebted countries such as Ireland, Portugal and
Spain are back in the headlines, with the cost of protecting
their government debt against default rising substantially in
the past week.
 The renewed concerns weighed on the euro , which hit
its lowest in more than a week versus the dollar. It was last
trading down 0.37 percent at $1.3869.
 Heavy Asian and Middle Eastern buying helped lift the euro
off a $1.3823 session low, traders said, but it stalled below
$1.40. Some traders also closed long positions against the
dollar ahead of year-end book-closing.
 The dollar was up against a basket currencies, with the
U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> rising 0.21 percent at 77.183. Against
the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 0.04 percent at
81.13.
 U.S. equities slipped after five weeks of gains, but an
index of gold and silver miners' shares <.XAU> hit an all-time
high. Shares of Barrick Gold  rose 2.5 percent to
$52.50.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 35.27
points, or 0.31 percent, at 11,371.57. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was down 3.69 points, or 0.30 percent, at
1,219.56. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 4.89
points, or 0.19 percent, at 2,575.16.
 European shares <.FTEU3> shrugged off euro zone debt
concerns to close at their highest level in more than two years
with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares up 0.6 percent at 1,117.46 points, its highest close
since September 2008.
 The MSCI all-country world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS>
eased 0.03 percent. Emerging market stocks <.MSCIEF> were up
0.16 percent.
 ""Quantitative easing, decent macroeconomic data and
valuations have helped equities to move higher. Earnings have
also played a big role,"" said Klaus Wiener, head of research at
Generali Investments, in Cologne.
 ""We are in a year-end rally and I don't see any disturbance
from the macro data side. The only thing which could be a bit
of a problem is the situation in countries like Ireland but
this is not being perceived as something which could derail the
whole monetary union project.""
 COMMODITIES RISE, G20 EYED
 Gold's rise was assisted by the Fed's decision to print
dollars to buy U.S. government debt, which weakened the dollar
and spurred commodity prices higher. Gold has gained nearly 30
percent this year so far.
 Spot gold prices  rose $11.85, or 0.84 percent, to
$1,420.90 an ounce, while silver  touched $28.46 an
ounce, the highest since March 1980.
 U.S. crude oil  rose 4 cents, or 0.05 percent, to
$87.10 per barrel, after touching $87.63, its highest since
October 2008 following the release of the International Energy
Agency's long-term energy outlook, in which it said oil prices
might exceed $100 a barrel in 2015 and $200 in 2035.
 U.S. government bond prices fell after data on U.S.
wholesale inventories showed a larger than expected rise,
fueling questions about whether inventories were gathering dust
on shelves.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 11/32, with the yield at 2.5974 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was down 2/32, with the yield at
0.4228 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was
down 35/32, with the yield at 4.1915 percent.

 BRUSSELS, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Air France-KLM ,
British Airways  and nine other airlines were fined a
total of 799 million euros ($1.11 billion) by EU regulators on
Tuesday in a price-fixing case that could open the way for
private claims against the companies.
 The European Commission said in a statement the carriers
coordinated surcharges for fuel and security without discounts
between late 1999 to early 2006.
 ""It is deplorable that so many major airlines coordinated
their pricing to the detriment of European businesses and
European consumers,"" Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia
said.
 The European Commission slapped a 340 million-euro fine,
the biggest in the case, on the Franco-Dutch group Air
France-KLM, which was formed from a merger in 2004 and which
acquired Martinair in 2008.
 Air France-KLM said in reaction that the penalty was
disproportionate and it would appeal to the court.

 It already faces a claim for up to 500 million euros from a
group of companies that includes Ericsson  and
Philips , seeking compensation for alleged air cargo
price-fixing. [ID:nLDE68S225]
 HUNDREDS OF PRIVATE CLAIMANTS
 Litigation firm Claims Funding International (CFI) which
filed the lawsuit on behalf of the companies, said the number
of claimants could increase.
 ""We have hundreds of companies waiting for the Commission
decision before they sign up,"" said Peter Koutsoukis, CFI
managing director. A Dutch court is due to hear the case on
March 30.
 The EU regulator fined British Airways 104 million euros,
Singapore Airlines  74.8 million euros, Cathay Pacific
<0293.HK> 57.12 million euros, Qantas  8.9 million
euros and Japan Airlines  35.7 million euros.
 Luxembourg-based Cargolux Airlines was fined 79.9 million
euros and LAN Chile  8.2 million euros.
 Air Canada , which was fined 21 million euros, said
it may appeal the decision. It also said it had made a C$125
million provision related to the case in 2008 [nN09295430].
 SAS , which was fined 70.2 million euros, said it
would appeal, but would provide for the charge in its
third-quarter earnings to be announced on Wednesday.
 Lufthansa  was found guilty of taking part in the
cartel but received immunity from punishment because it had
alerted the Commission to the existence of the price-fixing
scheme. Swiss International Air Lines, acquired by Lufthansa in
2005, also escaped a fine.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The euro struggled for a third
straight session on Tuesday, swinging from gains to losses as
investors worried about Irish and Portuguese debt and hedged
sizable bets against the U.S. dollar.
 Heavy Asian and Middle Eastern buying helped lift the euro
off a $1.3823 session low, traders said, but it stalled below
$1.40 as investors worried that peripheral euro zone countries
may struggle in coming months to finance their deficits.
 The euro last changed hands at $1.3873, down 0.4 percent.
Traders said an earlier slide below the 76.4 percent
retracement of a recent rally that peaked last week near $1.43
suggested it could fall as far as $1.3697 in the days ahead.
 ""The rebound into the $1.40s was probably a bit too rich
for the euro. I don't see much point holding it above there,""
said Andrew Wilkinson, analyst at Interactive Brokers Group.
 The euro hit its recent high after the U.S. Federal Reserve
said it would buy $600 billion of Treasuries by mid-2011 to
lower interest rates and reinvigorate a sluggish economy.
 While that has pushed U.S. bond yields lower and dulled the
appeal of dollar investments, Wilkinson said it may boost U.S.
growth in 2011, leaving markets to focus on the budget problems
in euro zone countries such as Ireland and Portugal.
 ""I don't think those fears are overblown,"" he said.
 The cost of protecting government debt against default in
Ireland and Portugal has risen in the past week, although it
eased ahead of a Portuguese bond auction.
 Irish debt came under pressure this week on fear the

 The euro also fell 0.4 percent to 112.44 yen while the
dollar lost 0.1 percent to 81.10 yen.
 A pullback in risk-taking sentiment after China said it
would strictly manage company short-term foreign debt quotas
contributed to yen gains, traders said..

(Updates with closing figures)
 By Selcuk Gokoluk
 ANKARA, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The Turkish lira and stocks ended
higher on Tuesday on hopes the country's debt will be upgraded
to investment grade and on a successful Treasury debt auction,
erasing earlier falls on growing European debt worries.
 Bonds also held firm as next week's religious holiday
prompted investors to keep positions in the Turkish government
debt to benefit from relatively higher yields.
 ""London-based sales in the bond market were offset by local
banks and others. It appears that there was not very serious
profit-taking because when the sales reach a certain level,
many buyers emerge as the market is very strong,"" said Yagiz
Oral, an Istanbul-based dealer in Denizbank.
 Turkish markets are increasingly expecting a credit rating
agencies to upgrade Turkey's sovereign debt ratings to
investment grade, and many banks point to 1.37 as a target level
for the dollar/lira rate, he said.
 Moody's said last week Turkey could get a credit rating
upgrade if its fiscal fundamentals improve.
 Moody's rates Turkey Ba2 -- two notches below investment
grade -- and has an outlook ""positive"" on its rating. Moody's
last upgraded Turkey's rating in January. 
 Standard and Poor's rates Turkey on par with Moody's at BB,
while Fitch rates it the highest at BB+ -- or one notch under
investment grade.
 Hedge funds actively sold euro and purchased lira on
Tuesday.
 ""As long as something that does not change this sentiment,
we will not see serious sales neither in forex nor in bonds,""
Oral said.
 The lira weakened against the dollar in the morning session
but recouped its losses in the afternoon to close at 1.4055, a
touch stronger than the previous session's 1.4090 closing level.
 The yield on the benchmark Aug. 8, 2012 bond was a tick
higher at 7.65 percent from the previous day's 7.63 percent.
The Turkish Treasury confirmed on Tuesday it had raised 500
million euros at a yield of 4.25 percent by re-opening its
euro-denominated bond due May 18, 2020. Proceeds will be used to
help pre-finance the country's 2011 borrowing programme.
 The bond attracted 4.6 billion euros of orders from 13
countries and achieved the lowest cost of borrowing of any
euro-denominated bond by Turkey to date, the Treasury said.
 ""The amount and quality of the demand for the transaction
has reconfirmed investors' strong and continuing confidence in
the Turkish economy,"" the Treasury said.
 Proceeds from the issue will be transferred to the Treasury

 ""This is a very good price considering Spain's 10-year bonds
are trading around 4.4 percent yield. In other words, the debt
market already upgraded Turkey's credit rating,"" said Tera
Brokers in a note to clients.
 Bond investors await a central bank rate-setting meeting on
Thursday for clues on the interest rates in the coming months.
The bank has kept its benchmark interest rate at 7.0 percent
since May despite rising inflation.
 The National ISE 100 index edged 0.85 percent higher to
71,543.26 points, or its highest closing level, outperforming
the MSCI index of benchmark emerging stocks which rose 0.4
percent.
 Turkish stocks have risen 34 percent since the start of the
year, far exceeding most other emerging country stock markets.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The euro erased losses against
the dollar on Tuesday but stalled below $1.40, weighed down by
worries about Irish and Portuguese government debt.
 Heavy Asian and Middle Eastern buying helped lift the euro
off a $1.3823 session low, trader said, but euro long positions
established in recent months will cap gains in the short run,
particularly with markets worried about euro-zone debt levels.
 The euro was last at $1.3921, little changed from late
Monday in New York, but traders said a retreat to $1.3697 was
possible after the euro's overnight slide pushed it beyond the
76.4 percent retracement of a recent rally that culminated last
week just shy of $1.43, a 9-1/2-month high.
 ""The rebound into the $1.40s was probably a bit too rich
for the euro. I don't see much point holding it above there,""
said Andrew Wilkinson, analyst at Interactive Brokers Group.
 The euro hit its recent high after the U.S. Federal Reserve
said it would buy $600 billion of Treasuries by mid-2011 to
lower interest rates and reinvigorate a sluggish economy.
 While that has pushed U.S. bond yields lower and dulled the
appeal of dollar investments, Wilkinson said it may boost U.S.
growth in 2011, leaving markets to focus on the budget problems
in euro zone countries such as Ireland and Portugal.
 ""I don't think those fears are overblown,"" he said.
 The cost of protecting government debt against default in
Ireland, Portugal and Spain has risen substantially in the past
week, although it eased a bit on Tuesday ahead of a Portuguese
bond auction the following day.
 Irish debt came under pressure this week on fear the
government won't be able to cut spending as much as planned
next year, which could complicate efforts to sell fresh debt.
 The European Central Bank responded last week by
intervening in bond markets after a three-week layoff.
 RISK TRADE GETTING LONG IN THE TOOTH
 The euro fell 0.5 percent to 112.26 yen while the dollar
lost 0.7 percent to 80.60 yen, not far from a 1995 record low
of 79.75 yen. Stops were seen in around 80.60, with buying
interest clustered in the 80.20-30 area, traders said.
 A pullback in risk-taking sentiment after China said it
would strictly manage company short-term foreign debt quotas
contributed to yen gains, traders said.
 Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange, said the bias was still for a weaker dollar but said
the threat of Japan repeating its September intervention to
weaken the yen was limiting the dollar's downside.
 Some traders said intervention was unlikely ahead of a
Group of 20 nations meeting later this week, at which leaders
were expected to discuss ways of reducing global economic
imbalances.
 Emerging market governments have also complained that loose
monetary policy in developed countries, chiefly the United
States, is stoking inflation in their countries.
 Analysts said that means investors should be wary of a
sudden pullback in high-yielding emerging market assets and
commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian dollar.
 Traders said some macro accounts and commodity trading
advisers, who are short-term players, were closing their long
euro and short dollar forward and futures positions ahead of
their book closing at the end of this month or next.
 ""The 'risk-on' trade has come so far since the end of
August. It could have more to go, but I'm skeptical when you've
got the Australian and Canadian dollars at par with the U.S.
dollar and Asian leaders saying they won't stand for continued
inflows of hot money,"" he said. ""At some point, something will
crack.""

 * Trade secretary sees risk of trade war
 * Brazil taking specific measures but no broad ones
 * Brazil action will respect WTO rules
 By Ana Nicolaci da Costa and Isabel Versiani
 BRASILIA, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Failure by the Group of 20
nations this week to achieve a global solution to the problem
of currency imbalances could lead to a trade war, Brazil's
Foreign Trade Secretary Welber Barral said.
 Brazil is working towards a multilateral resolution to
imbalances which have resulted in massive capital flows going
into emerging markets, boosting their currencies and making
exports expensive, Barral said in an interview late on Monday.
 Attempts at restricting capital flows, such as those Brazil
adopted last month, have done little to curb large inflows of
dollars which are only likely to increase with the Federal
Reserve's decision last week to pour an additional $600 billion
into the world's largest economy.
 Leaders of emerging market economies said the Fed's move
made any substantive deal on cutting global economic imbalances
less likely at this week's G20 meeting in Seoul, South Korea.
 ""Our proposals ... are multilateral commitments. If (a
deal) is not reached there is a risk that every country seeks
individual solutions which can be costly for everyone,"" Barral
told Reuters, adding these could range from currency to trade
measures.
 Asked about the risks of a trade war, he said:
 ""If there is no compromise in Seoul, this could happen.""

 World leaders may be able to agree to new financial
regulations and praise an IMF power sharing deal at a G20
meeting in Seoul this week, but tensions over global imbalances
and how to deal with them are simmering. Reuters takes you to
the frontlines of this diplomatic battle with analysis,
commentary, scenarios, videos and graphics in this PDF:

 Countries around the world from Colombia to Japan are
acting to keep their currencies from appreciating as investors,
turning their back on low interest rates in developed
economies, pour money into higher-yielding markets. See
[ID:nSGE69503F] for factbox.
 Brazil has been among the boldest in its attempts to
contain the rise of its currency, the real , in an effort
to protect its exporters. Last month it tripled a tax on flows
of foreign capital into local bonds and increased a levy on
derivatives, while it has continued to regularly buy dollars in
the foreign exchange market.
 A rally in the real has already increased demand from the
private sector for more government action against dumping and
smuggling, Barral said. Brazil initiated 27 investigations into
anti-dumping in the year to October, against 19 for the whole
of 2009.
 ""(The strong currency) increases pressures from the private
sector in relation to problems that sometimes already exist,""
Barral said.
 ""Some sectors struggle with smuggling, for example, but pay
little attention to it. As the currency becomes a problem, the
smuggling issue becomes more central.""
 But trade restrictions are unlikely and any action would
abide by the norms of the World Trade Organization.
 ""We have been adopting some specific measures,"" he said.
""Brazil has not adopted, nor will it adopt -- it's extremely
unlikely that it will adopt measures across the board,"" Barral
said.

 * FRANCE: 
 -- France's Constitutional Council approved President
Nicolas Sarkozy's pension bill on Tuesday, clearing the last
hurdle to a reform that will raise the retirement age by two
years to stem a huge pension deficit.
 -- The law will raise the retirement age to 62 from 60 by

raise public sector contributions to private sector levels. The
reform will also raise the eligible age to receive a full
pension to 67 from 65. [ID:nLDE6A81QF]
 -- The budget aims to cut the public deficit to 6 percent of
gross domestic product in 2011 from an estimated 7.7 percent in
2010, in the first phase of a plan to trim the shortfall to the
EU's 3 percent ceiling in 2013, and 2 percent in 2014.
 -- Raising the top marginal rate of tax to 41 percent from
40 percent to fund pension reforms.
 -- Raising the tax on capital gains by one percentage point.
 -- The end of a one-off corporate tax break in 2010 will
increase revenues by 5.3 billion euros.
 -- The government aims to raise some 400 million euros from
the sale of property in 2011.
 -- The end of fiscal stimulus measures will cut 8.2 billion
euros from the deficit.

 * IRELAND:
 -- The Irish government side-stepped questions last Friday
about when it would unveil a four-year austerity plan.
[ID:nLDE6A405Z]
-- It said on Nov. 4 it would push through spending cuts and
tax hikes totalling 6 billion euros in 2011 to get its budget
deficit under control by a deadline of 2014.
 -- Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said he expected next
year's adjustment, which will be weighed more on the spending
side, would cut the deficit to 9.25-9.5 percent of GDP in 2011
and to 2.75-3 percent of GDP in 2014, the deadline he has agreed
with Brussels to get the shortfall under control.
 -- The budget deficit is set to blow out to 32 percent of
GDP in 2010 due to the one-off inclusion of a mammoth bill for
bailing out Ireland's banks. Excluding the bank bill, the
deficit will be nearly 12 percent of GDP this year.
-- Fitch cut Ireland's credit rating last month and consumer
morale slumped as the cost of cleaning up its banks hit home,
piling pressure on the government to bring forward the 2011
budget, the toughest on record, due on Dec 7.
 * PORTUGAL:
 -- Portugal's parliament on Nov. 3 approved the general
guidelines of the budget bill, clearing another hurdle for a
fiscal programme that aims to sharply cut the deficit.
 -- Portugal has promised to cut this year's budget deficit
to 7.3 percent of gross domestic product from 9.3 percent last
year and further reduce it to 4.6 percent in 2011.
 Here are some of the measures:
 -- Cuts of 5 percent in civil servant wages and increases in
taxes in an effort to save 5.1 billion euros ($6.93 billion)
next year.
 -- On the revenue side, the measures would add 1.7 billion
euros to state coffers, or one percentage point of gross
domestic product. They include:
 -- Value-added tax to be raised by 2 percentage points for
top level to 23 percent from 21 percent, expands on a 1
percentage point increase on all levels implemented in July.

 * GREECE:
 -- Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said this month he
was not bluffing about the possibility of calling snap elections
and needed support for policies meant to bring Greece's deficit
to under 3 percent of GDP by 2014 from over 15 percent in 2009.
 -- Greece unveiled its latest austerity budget on Oct. 4.
The budget targeted a deficit of 7.0 percent of GDP in 2011,
from a projected 7.8 percent in 2010 and below an initial 8.1
percent target under a baseline IMF/EU scenario.

502,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2010 09:28AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Ireland sneezes but little sign of globalised cold," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - About six months ago, the euro
zone debt crisis was hot enough to trigger headlines like ""Wall
Street falls on worries about Greece"".
 It was all about contagion, fears that default in economic
minnow Greece could spread not just to Portugal and Spain but
beyond, crushing the euro zone in its wake.
 Tensions are increasing again about debt in the euro zone
periphery -- particularly Ireland -- with some yield spreads and
debt-insurance costs at record levels.
 But to date there has been little sign of global contagion,
primarily because investors have been looking elsewhere --
mainly the Federal Reserve -- and because of crisis management
programmes that can now be employed by policymakers.
 The spread between Irish 10-year bonds  and
German Bunds  hit a record 571 basis points on
Tuesday, up from around 300 at the height of the crisis and a
good 200 above where it was in mid-October.
 Greece, too, is back up to uncomfortable levels, if not as
wide as at the height of the crisis, and Portugal's spread has
widened to a record as well.
 The impact further afield, however, has only been felt
mildly so far, mainly on the euro, and even then only in the
past day or so at a time when the dollar has been rising broadly
anyway.
 ""Markets fear of contagion has fallen,"" said Klaus Wiener,
head of research at Generali Investments in Cologne. ""In May,
the escalation of the debt crisis in Greece threatened to end in
a systemic crisis. This fear is not as pronounced any longer.""
 The 30-day correlation between the movement in peripheral
bond spreads and the euro was around -0.6 in May, meaning that
widening in spreads was usually matched by euro weakness.
 That correlation is now close to zero for Ireland and only
slightly negative for Greece, suggesting that at least over the
past month the debt problems have been isolated, having little
if any impact on the currency.
 It is more or less the same story with stocks. In the past
three weeks as the Irish spread has widened 200 basis points,
the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 stock index <.FTEU3> has
gained more than three percent. It was up three-quarters of a
percent on Tuesday as the spreads widened to another record.
 Globally, stocks have paid even less attention, with MSCI's
all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> rising around 4 percent
over the period.
Data from iTraxx, meanwhile, shows that investors are
pricing in the chances of default in European companies as less
than that for Western European sovereigns -- not good news for
sovereigns but hardly a thumbs down for corporates, which
suggests fear does not stretch to a systemic crisis which would
surely engulf companies as well.

 DIFFERENT CONDITIONS
 There are two main reasons why the market impact from the
renewed debt worries has been muted so far.
 One is simply that investors have had their minds on other
things, notably the $600 billion quantitative easing programme
launched by the Fed last week to stimulate the U.S. economy.
 The global economic picture has also improved, with even
lagging U.S. jobs creation ticking up.
 ""The big theme was quantitative easing, the economic cycle.
It is undeniable that the data has been positive, almost
globally,"" said Joost Van Leenders, investment specialist at BNP
Paribas Investment Partners in Amsterdam.
The second big reason is that investors believe lessons were
learnt in the earlier Greek crisis and policymakers stand ready
to stop disorderly default contagion.
 Since June, a European stabilisation mechanism has been in
place, funded by the European Union and International Monetary
Fund, to provide as much as 750 billion euros at relatively low
interest rates to euro zone countries needing them.
 No money has been taken, but it is seen by many as a safety
net.
 There are also plans afoot to create a permanent mechanism.
Although political differences will make agreement hard, the
mere fact that it is under discussion underlines the willingness
of authorities to act.
 None of this is to say that the current stresses in Ireland
and elsewhere are negligible. It is inconceivable, for example,
that a default or restructuring in Greece or Ireland would not
have wider impact.
 But the lack of sharp reaction outside the countries
concerned so far does suggest investors are not expecting a blow
up across markets similar to the one earlier this year.

percent
 * Essar expected to re-start ZISCO ops ""as soon as possible""

(Adds details, quotes)
 By Nelson Banya
 HARARE, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Zimbabwe has chosen Essar Africa
Holdings Ltd, an arm of India's Essar Group, to take majority
control of troubled state-owned steel maker ZISCO, a senior
official said on Tuesday.
 Industry and Commerce deputy Minister Mike Bimha said Essar
Africa would buy a 54 percent stake in the company, with
government keeping 36 percent. The remaining 10 percent is owned
by small private investors.
 Bimha told reporters the government had approved ""the
recommendation that Essar Africa Holidings be assigned the
responsibility of comprehensively revising the country's steel
giant"". He did not provide financial details of the deal.
 Zisco is the first privatisation under a power-sharing
government formed last year by bitter rivals Robert Mugabe and
Morgan Tsvangirai.
 Despite their rapprochement, Zimbabwe is struggling to
attract the $10 billion of foreign investment economists say is
needed to fix the economy after a decade of chronic decline and
hyperinflation.
 Bimha said Essar should be on the ground before the end of
the year and resume production ""as soon as possible"" at ZISCO,
once a major foreign currency earner but now saddled with debt.
 As part of the deal, it will take over Zisco's $240 million
debt.
 The government identified cash-starved ZISCO, with capacity
to produce 1 million tonnes of steel per year, as the first
state-owned firm to be sold to revive its operations.
 In May, it said Mugabe had rejected bids by the shortlisted
South African unit of ArcelorMittal and Jindal Steel, saying
they were too big and that Zimbabwe preferred medium-sized
investors..
 ZISCO stopped operations in 2008 at the height of Zimbabwe's
economic meltdown, weighed down by $300 million of debt.
 While the coalition has stabilised the economy, frequent
wrangles and an empowerment law seeking to localise control of
all foreign firms has discouraged many foreign investors.
 However, the government has said ZISCO's privatisation is
excluded from the empowerment law, which compels foreign-owned
firms including mines and banks eventually to sell an at least
51 percent shareholding to local blacks.

 * French retailer Casino confident full ban will succeed
 * Retailers admit some ""green"" palm oil targets difficult
 
 By Sybille de La Hamaide
 PARIS, Nov 9 (Reuters) - French retailers have promised to
ban palm oil or switch to sustainable sources after a public
outcry about links to deforestation and damage to health, but
some of them will struggle to achieve their targets.
 Green groups blame cultivation of palm oil, used in products
ranging from biscuits to cosmetics, for destroying rainforests
and threatening endangered species in the major producing
countries, mainly Indonesia and Malaysia, and have urged food
companies to stop using it in their products.
 Taking the lead, Casino said earlier this year it would
eliminate palm oil from all the group's own-brand food products
and replace it with other vegetable oils such as rapeseed or
sunflower.
 France's fifth-biggest food retailer said that in addition
to environmental issues, it was also motivated by concerns that
the high level of saturated fat in palm oil could raise
cholesterol and cause heart disease.
 Other retailers including Carrefour, Europe's biggest
retailer, and cooperative group E.Leclerc, the leader in the
French market with a 17 percent share, have not committed to ban
palm oil but have said all palm oil used in their products would
need to be ""green"" by 2015, which means it must be certified by
the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).
 RSPO experts, palm oil traders and food company executives
said some retailers' targets are so ambitious that they will be
tough to achieve.
 
 ""CLOSE TO IMPOSSIBLE""
 Casino's plan to ban palm oil is seen as hardly feasible.
 ""For a retailer to guarantee that their products are palm
oil-free could easily turn out to be its biggest challenge ever!
I would say close to impossible,"" said Bas Geerts, traceability
manager at UTZ Certified, which certifies sustainable palm oil.
 Not only is palm oil cheaper but also many products contain
it in different forms, making it difficult to trace. 
 Also as opposed to other vegetable oils, palm oil is solid
at ambient temperatures, which makes it hard to replace in
products such as margarine.
 But Casino said the firm and its suppliers had invested in
research to find new techniques to overcome such difficulties
and that it is ahead of its 2010 target to cut palm oil from 200
out of 571 products.
 ""I am confident, very confident. We gave ourselves three
years from the day of the announcement, and we are already ahead
of schedule,"" Philippe Imbert, head of quality at Casino, told
Reuters in an interview.
 ""For some products it is indeed more complex, but in the
light of what we see coming up, I am optimistic,"" Imbert said.
""I think that where there is a will, there is a way.""
 
 RSPO OIL OUTPUT UNKNOWN
 For retailers that aim to boost their green image, the RSPO
offers a variety of certificates.
 The cheap option is the so-called ""book and claim""
certificate, in which manufacturers continue to use conventional
palm oil but pay a premium, which is used to help finance
sustainable projects.
 Carrefour said it would buy book and claim certificates for
all palm oil used in its own-brand grocery products in France --
about 10,000 tonnes -- by 2015 to encourage suppliers to adopt
the scheme.
 Food companies such as Unilever and Nestle have also
committed to increasingly use this certified palm oil.
 Book and claim certificates are widely available, which
means these companies are likely to fulfil their commitments if
they are ready to pay the premiums.
 Another more difficult RSPO option is to use ""segregated
palm oil"", which is guaranteed as cultivated in a fully
sustainable way and traced from the field to the factory. These
certificates are more expensive, and there are fewer of them.
 E.Leclerc said it aimed at selling own-brand products
containing only segregated palm oil, or if it is not available,
so-called ""mass-balanced"", a sustainable palm oil that can be
blended with classical palm oil provided it can be traced.
 ""Our goal is that by 2015 all palm oil (in our own-brand
products) be substituted or RSPO,"" E.Leclerc's Quality and
Sustainable Development Director Catherine Gomy said, noting
that the aim was to use only segregated palm oil if possible.
 Both E.Leclerc and Casino have set the same target date for
the use of sustainable palm oil in non-food products.
 But the market for RSPO segregated palm oil may not be able
to supply the volumes needed by 2015 to meet this increasing
industry demand, making such objectives hard to achieve.
 ""For a retailer to guarantee that 100 percent of all its
products will be fully sustainable (segregated), that's huge,""
said Bob Norman, head of GreenPalm, a web-based platform
allowing certified palm producers to sell book and claim
certificates.
 ""Is it achievable in the next few years? I don't think so.
If you have 75 percent, that is fantastic,"" he added.
 The RSPO is holding a three-day conference that started on
Monday in Jakarta to discuss the industry's move toward
eco-friendly cultivation and to look at ways of getting buyers
to choose ""green"" palm oil.

* Chances of more QE in the UK recede slightly
* No rate hike seen in U.S., Japan until 2012
 * No ECB or BOE rate rise until Q4 2011 at earliest
 * Inflation view subdued, except in the UK
 
 By Ross Finley
 LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Growth prospects across the rich
world have not budged since the Federal Reserve announced a
second round of bond purchases worth $600 billion, according to
the latest Reuters poll of more than 200 economists.
 The latest consensus forecasts lend support to critics of
the Fed's hotly-debated policy of further expanding its balance
sheet to boost the economy who say it will do more to lift
already-soaring asset prices instead.
 Polling for the U.S., euro zone and Britain was conducted
after the Fed announced last week it planned to resume its
quantitative easing (QE) programme.
 The central bank itself appears split on the merits of more
QE, with several Fed policymakers vocally discussing it, on top
of numerous emerging market policymakers sniping at the Fed
ahead of the G20 summit in Seoul this week.
 Still, economists say that more Fed bond purchases provide
insurance against the risk that the world's largest economy
suffers another sharp slowdown, and should underpin growth in
the rest of the rich world, even with a weaker dollar.
 ""Over the next couple of quarters we still think the growth
pace is likely to fall short of the longer-term trend,"" said Jan
Hatzius, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs in New York.
 Some economists are becoming a bit more optimistic,
coinciding with a return to meaningful private sector payroll
growth in the latest month.
 ""But as we move through 2011, the lagged effects of the
renewed monetary easing combined with a gradual slowdown in the
pace of private deleveraging should result in a substantial
pickup in GDP growth,"" Hatzius said.
 The Reuters consensus was for 2.0 percent annualised U.S.
GDP growth in the current quarter, picking up to 2.5 percent in
the second quarter and 3.0 percent by the end of next year, all
unchanged from the October survey.
 These modest rates of growth stand in contrast with emerging
Asian economies like India and China, which analysts said in a
poll taken last month would expand more than 8 percent and close
to 9 percent in the coming year.
 ""We expect that the Fed's new large-scale asset purchase
program -- dubbed QE2 -- will likely boost growth only modestly,
perhaps by 0.2 percent to 0.3 percent in 2011,"" said Richard
Berner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.
 
 ASSET PRICES SPARKLE
 Not so for asset prices.
 Since Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke strongly hinted in late
August that QE2 was on its way, the Nasdaq Composite index of
mainly technology shares is up about 20 percent. The MSCI index
of emerging market equities is up about 15 percent. Gold is up
more than 12 percent. Copper is up 16 percent. Crude oil is up
16 percent. And silver is up about 50 percent.
 The growth outlook for Japan is slightly more pessimistic in
the short-term. Economists expect a slight contraction in the
current quarter, partly based on a persistently strong yen, set
to remain that way as the dollar comes under pressure from QE2.
 In the euro zone, where the biggest economies Germany and
France have been leading the way, leaving Spain, Italy and many
in the periphery behind, the overall growth picture has not
changed much either compared with last month.
 But policymakers in Europe, who are once again dealing with
a very strong euro and renewed concerns in markets about the
fiscal position of some of its weakest economies like Ireland
and Greece, have sharply criticised the Fed's latest round of
QE. The German finance minister called it ""clueless"" last week.
 Growth prospects have improved slightly in the UK, despite
draconian budget cuts on the horizon, thanks to a run of strong
economic growth figures. Business surveys are also pointing up
even if the labour market remains weak.
 That has reduced even further already receding chances that
the Bank of England embarks on another round of quantitative
easing after 200 billion pounds ($323 billion) worth of bond
purchases.
 It opted not to do so at its November policy meeting and a
bare majority of economists in the latest sample -- 12 of 23 --
say the BoE is likely now done expanding its balance sheet. The
median estimate of the 11 who said the bank would extend QE was
for a 50 billion pounds increase.
 Unlike the Fed, the BoE is grappling with inflation running
well above its 2.0 percent target, allowing less room for
manoeuvre.

increasingly difficult for the BoE to expand QE, regardless of
its dovish bias,"" said Matteo Carrozza, economist at British
building society Nationwide.

 BRUSSELS, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The European Union's chief trade
negotiator said on Tuesday he expected a successful conclusion
to the Doha round of international trade talks by the end of
next year.
 Speaking to the European Parliament's trade committee, Karel
De Gucht called for the summit of G20 leading economies in South
Korea this week to signal the restart of the trade talks, which
began in November 2001 and have continued intermittently.
 De Gucht said he expected a meeting of WTO trade ministers
to be convened during 2011, leading to the signing of a global
deal. Ministerial meetings are not usually called unless there
is an expectation of an accord being reached.
 De Gucht, who is not attending the G20 talks, said he
expected the leading emerging trade powers -- Brazil, China,
India, Mexico and South Africa -- to hold talks late this year
or nearly next, adding momentum to a possible deal.
 ""(I would envisage) a meeting of the G5 at ministerial level
after Seoul. I think there is some momentum to do that,"" he
said, referring to the five largest emerging economies.

 By David Milliken and Christina Fincher
 LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - British house prices fell last
month at their fastest pace in 18 months and manufacturing
growth slowed, according to data on Tuesday that flagged the
risk of a sharp slowdown in the coming months.
 Disappointing trade data and a downbeat assessment from the
British Retail Consortium added to worries that overseas demand
will be insufficient to compensate for domestic headwinds next
year as a result of hefty public spending cuts, and a rise in
value added tax.
 Britain's economy enjoyed its best six-month performance in
a decade between April and September, but few economists expect
that pace to be maintained.
 The Bank of England will publish new quarterly forecasts on
Wednesday that are likely to show growth slowing in the first
half of 2011. The BoE has indicated a willingness to pump more
money into the economy via asset purchases should economic
conditions deteriorate, but stubborn inflationary pressures
could limit its room for manoeuvre.
 The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' house price
index dropped to -49 in the three months to October, below even
the most pessimistic forecast in a Reuters poll, from -36 in the
three months to September. 
 Surveyors blamed a lack of mortgage finance and an uncertain
economic outlook for the weakness of buyer demand and predicted
further losses to come.
 
 MANUFACTURING GROWTH COOLS
 Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed
manufacturing output grew just 0.1 percent in September, its
weakest rate since April, after an upwardly revised 0.4 percent
increase in August.
 The broader measure of industrial output maintained a steady
pace of growth, at 0.4 percent, but only thanks to robust energy
and utilities production.
 ""We still doubt that the industrial sector on its own can
compensate for the effects of the fiscal squeeze on the rest of
the economy,"" said Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics.
 Britain's industrial output has bounced back strongly over
the past eight months after suffering heavily in the country's
worst recession since World War Two. Total industrial output in
the third quarter was up 4.1 percent on a year ago, the fastest
rate of growth since February 1995.
 Separate data on Tuesday showed the global goods trade gap
fell by less than expected in September to 8.228 billion pounds
-- not far off the all-time record of 8.506 billion pounds
struck in July.
 There were also signs of building price pressures. Excluding
oil and erratic items, import and export prices both rose on the
month by 0.9 percent.
 ""Although it is unwise to read much into what are volatile
monthly data, these reversals seem consistent with other signs
of incipient inflationary pressures in the global economy,"" said
Simon Hayes at Barclays Capital.

 By Leigh Thomas
 PARIS, Nov 9 (Reuters) - France will escape a sharp slowdown
in growth in the second half of the year with the second biggest
euro zone economy projected to expand 0.5 percent in the final
quarter of 2010, according to Bank of France data on Tuesday.
 The 1.9 trillion euro economy is picking up momentum thanks
to improving activity in industry and the service sector after
growth moderated in the third quarter to an estimate of 0.3
percent by the central bank.
 ""This basically is consistent with the idea that what we'll
have in the second half of 2010 is a super-soft landing, rather
than anything really nasty, which is good news,"" said Deutsche
Bank economist Gilles Moec.
 ""But for 2011 I remain quite prudent because we haven't yet
seen the impact of the fiscal consolidation and I don't think
we've seen all the impact of the reappreciation of the currency
since June,"" he added.
 According to a Reuters poll, economists expect official data
due on Friday to show that the French economy grew 0.4 percent
in the third quarter after expanding 0.7 percent in the second
quarter.
 Economists forecast that the economy is set to grow 1.5
percent this year after a 2.2 percent contraction in 2009, a
year of recession across the industrialised world.
 The French central bank said its monthly industry sentiment
index rose to 103 in October from 102 in September, while the
indicator for France's dominant service sector remained stable
at 96.
 For the months ahead, the central bank said it expected
activity to continue to grow in the services sector, while
industrial output was also set to improve.
 The data follow figures last month that showed business
confidence topping its long-term average in October
(ID:PISKLE6AT) and consumer morale rising three times faster
than expected in September (ID:LDE69P0CC).
 However, the most recent surveys of purchasing managers
suggested that France's factory upturn moderated in October
(ID:SLA1ME6GZ) while widespread strikes over pension reform
weighed on the dominant services sector (ID:SLA3ME6HJ).
 
 INVESTMENT SURVEY TEMPERS OUTLOOK
 A survey of industrial investment, often a volatile gauge,
added a less promising note to the stream of data.
 The rate of investment was seen falling two percent in 2010,
revised down from an increase of five percent in the last poll
in July, the INSEE national statistics office said.
 But investment was seen rebounding next year by nine
percent.
 BNP Paribas economist Dominique Barbet said the downward
revision was not alarming insofar as a strong recovery was
foreseen in 2011.
 ""But it does show a high level of hesitation and worry among
companies,"" he added.
 Separately, France's trade deficit narrowed less than
expected in September to 4.683 billion euros versus the previous
month, according to the customs office.
 An increase in the number of Airbus shipments, the sale of
two satellites and strong demand for French wheat in Africa
helped reduce the deficit.

 By Emily Kaiser
 SEOUL, Nov 9 (Reuters) - China kept up a drumbeat of
criticism of U.S. easy money policies on Tuesday, warning two
days before a G20 world economic summit that Washington could
destabilise the global economy and inflate asset bubbles.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel dismissed U.S. calls for
numerical limits for current account balances but said she hoped
to avoid a confrontation at the Seoul summit between China and
the United States over trade and currencies.
 ""I don't think much of quantified balance of payments
targets,"" Merkel told Tuesday's Financial Times, warning that
monetary tensions could fuel protectionism.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has already backed
away from the proposal to set targets for current accounts gaps,
and Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said it was not
likely that the G20 would agree on any hard numbers.
 ""It's more likely that countries will agree a common
approach, and finance ministers from the member countries will
debate the details later,"" he told reporters in Tokyo.
 The U.S. Federal Reserve's new $600 billion bond-buying
programme has drawn global scorn because of concerns it will
send a flood of cash into the world economy without doing much
to reinvigorate a lacklustre U.S. recovery.
 Ma Delun, a deputy governor of the People's Bank of China,
said he was concerned the Fed's spending spree may undermine
efforts to balance out global growth.
 The Fed's programme ""may add risks to the global economic
imbalance, put pressure on emerging markets to adjust their
international balance of payments and could also stir the
formation of asset bubbles, all of which require our vigilance"",
Ma said in Beijing.
 In the latest move by an emerging economy to brake inflows
of ""hot money"", Taiwan said on Tuesday it would bar foreign
investors from placing more than 30 percent of their funds in
Taiwan in local government bonds and money-market products,
reviving a curb scrapped in 1995.
 
 PROTECTIONIST WORRIES
 Leaders of the Group of 20 economies meet on Thursday and
Friday, eager to show they have not lost the cooperative spirit
forged during the depths of the financial crisis in 2008.
 But growing discontent over exchange rates and trade has
exposed deep international rifts, while Ireland's worsening debt
troubles have revived euro zone bond market jitters, a reminder
that global recovery remains vulnerable to financial turmoil.
 The risk premium investors charge for holding Irish and
Portuguese bonds reached new peaks on Tuesday amid concerns over
their ability to rein in ballooning budget deficits.
 If G20 leaders are unable to calm tensions this week, it
could intensify investor concerns that global cooperation is
giving way to national policies that may not be in the world
economy's best interest.
 High on the worry list is protectionism.
 Although G20 finance leaders pledged last month to shun
competitive currency devaluations, the Fed's bond-buying
programme has deepened concerns that the U.S. dollar is headed
lower, driving up exchange rates in other countries.
 ""The greatest danger that threatens us is protectionism, and
we are still not taking enough steps to ensure genuinely free
trade,"" Merkel told the Financial Times, voicing concern at
steps by the U.S. Congress to raise non-tariff barriers.
 China's tight grip on the yuan's rate means other
fast-growing emerging markets such as Brazil end up taking the
brunt of the currency adjustment.
 Taiwan is only the latest to act to counter that.
 World Bank President Robert Zoellick called for a new global
currency system, perhaps with gold as a reference point. The
idea drew criticism from many policymakers and economists and
there was no indication it was on the G20's agenda this week.
 Li Daokui, an academic adviser to China's central bank, said
China wanted a more ""reasonable"" global monetary system but its
objective was not to replace the dollar with the yuan.
 
 SECURITY TIGHTENS
 Seoul raised its security alert to its highest level due to
concerns of violent anti-capitalist protests -- a common feature
of past G8 and G20 summits -- and worries that rival North Korea
may try to stage an incident to embarrass it.
 A large number of protests are expected with the biggest
rally of unionists and anti-capitalists expected on Thursday.
Some 50,000 police officers have been dispatched.
 Authorities have set up a 2 km (1.25 mile) security zone
around the main summit venue, and a special law gives police
greater authority to thwart demonstrations and deploy troops.
 Keeping the political peace will be a priority for G20
leaders inside the security zone.
 Despite well-publicised differences, Geithner insisted there
was broad agreement among G20 members -- including China -- on
narrowing global imbalances between cash-rich exporters and
debt-laden consumer countries.
 G20 leaders agreed last year on a ""framework"" for more
balanced growth, which called on surplus countries such as China
to bolster domestic demand while the United States and other big
importers boosted savings and investment.
 ""I'm very confident that you're going to see very strong
consensus on this basic framework,"" Geithner told an audience of
Indian business leaders. ""The Chinese are very supportive of it.
It has a lot of benefits to them.""

 * Market watching G20 meeting
 
 By Maria Golovnina
 LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - World stocks gained and Wall
Street looked set to rise on Tuesday despite increasing concerns
in Europe about the state of some euro zone debt.
 The renewed concerns about peripheral euro zone economies
weighed on the euro, which hit its lowest in more than a week
versus the dollar before recovering to sit flat at $1.3928.
 Some players also closed long positions against the dollar
ahead of year-end book-closing.
 Jitters about potential default or restructuring in Ireland,
Portugal and Spain were evident.
 The cost of protecting Portuguese government debt against
default rose to a record high, with five-year credit default
swaps increasing by 15 basis points since Monday's New York
close to 480 bps.
 But European shares shrugged off concerns and climbed to new
two year highs, up almost three-quarters of a percent.
 The MSCI all-country world equity index rose 0.29 percent.
Emerging market stocks were up close to 0.2 percent.
 ""You've had the best of both worlds in equity markets.
You've had good data, particularly in jobs, earnings growth and
the Fed stimulus has brought bond yields down,"" said Bernard
McAlinden, investment strategist at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin.
 ""The background is right for markets to break above the
highs.""
 
 G20 AHEAD
 U.S. crude oil gained 44 cents to $87.53 a barrel.
 German government bond prices rose with funding and default
concerns pushing peripheral euro zone yield spreads wider.
 Investors were also watching this week's meeting of Group of
20 leaders in South Korea, pitched as a chance to prevent a
currency row escalating into a rush to protectionism that could
imperil the global recovery.
 There is little sign of consensus and the meeting has been
overshadowed by disagreements over the Fed's quantitative easing
policy.
 Gold extended earlier gains in European trade, hitting
$1,414.80 an ounce with buying fuelled by inflation concerns and
currency market uncertainty.
 Adding to the market's cautious tone, officials at the U.S.
Federal Reserve offered differing assessments of the central
bank's $600 billion bond-buying programme announced last week.
 One argued it was an effective way to offset deflation risks
and another warned it might need to be curbed to head-off
inflationary pressures.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The euro erased early losses
against the dollar on Tuesday as Asian accounts bought on dips,
but the single currency remained pressured on concerns about
peripheral euro zone debt.
 In choppy trade, the euro fell to its lowest in more than a
week against the dollar, to $1.3823 on trading platform EBS
early in the session, nearly a full cent below the day's highs.
 But buying from Asian sovereign accounts, particularly from
the Middle East, stemmed losses and sent short-term traders
scurrying to cover positions, which pushed the euro back to
around $1.3925 by 0947 GMT.
 Traders also mentioned buying interest around $1.3850 to
protect option barriers at $1.3800, and talk of a double
no-touch option at $1.38/$1.48.
 Analysts said there was still potential for a slide to more
important support at its Oct. 20 low of $1.3697, having fallen
below support at $1.3835, the 76.4 percent retracement of its
move up from the Oct. 20 low to $1.4283 on Nov. 4.
 ""We are bearish on the euro with spreads widening and
peripheral euro zone debt once again under pressure,"" said
Hans-Guenter Redeker, chief FX strategist at BNP Paribas. 
 The cost of protecting government debt against default in
Ireland, Portugal and Spain has risen substantially in the past
week, highlighting the difficulties Europe faces with its
sovereign debt and banking problems.
 Commerzbank analysts said bond investors had priced in a
more than 40 percent likelihood of a loss on Irish debt and of
more than 33 percent for Portugal over the next five years.
 Against this background, nervous investors will await the
outcome of a Portuguese issue of six-and 10-year bonds on
Wednesday. Any difficulties could see the euro fall more.

 The euro also shed losses against the yen, but was still
down 0.4 percent at 112.50 yen after falling to a one-week low
of 111.74 yen
 ""A more risk-averse environment would begin to favour a
dollar rebound alongside a corrective sell-off for equities,""
said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ.
 
 HEDGE FUNDS BOOK CLOSURE AND G20
 Traders said some macro players and Commodity Trading
Advisers, who are short-term players, were closing their long
euro and short dollar forward and futures positions ahead of
their book closing at the end of this month or next.
 The dollar fell 0.4 percent on the day to 80.78 yen
after earlier holding steady above 81.00, above its 1995 record
low of 79.75 yen and capped at 82 yen, where offers from
Japanese corporates were seen.
 A pullback in risk-taking sentiment after China said it
would strictly manage company short-term foreign debt quotas
prompted yen gains, traders said.
 The market was also watching this week's meeting of Group of
20 leaders in South Korea, as they attempted to agree on ways to
reduce global imbalances to bolster a fragile global economic
recovery.
 Meanwhile, The New Zealand dollar fell sharply on reports
the United States had stopped importing kiwi-fruit vine on

 LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Investors hungry for emerging
markets exposure but fearful of getting slammed by capital
controls are finding an attractive new option -- global bonds
that developing nations are issuing in their own currencies.
 Listed on overseas exchanges and subject to international
law, these bonds give investors exposure to emerging currencies,
yet skirt the exchange curbs that more and more countries are
mulling to stem the steady appreciation of their currencies.
 The capital controls hubbub looks set to grow after the U.S.
Federal Reserve last week effectively unleashed more cash onto
world markets, with Latin American and Asian policymakers vowing
more steps against the capital flooding their countries.
 For a U.S. fund manager, it may seem sensible to trade in
his rapidly-depreciating dollars for a Philippine peso bond that
is free of future exchange curbs and is payable in dollars.
 Buying a local bond in Manila necessitates opening a local
custody account there, but a global bond is easier to access --
the fund manager pays dollars to the exchange bank which does a
spot FX transaction on his behalf. On coupon dates, he gets
dollars, with the bank again doing the peso conversion.
 ""The advantage for investors is first, that these bonds are
easy to clear, and second, they are not subject to capital
controls as they are offshore deals,"" said Kieran Curtis, who
helps manage $1.4 billion in emerging debt at Aviva Investors.
 The threat of capital controls looks very real. While
Brazil's 6 percent tax on flows to local debt securities is by
far the most draconian, there are fears others may emulate it as
record flows into emerging markets -- over $80 billion this
year, according to EPFR Global -- show no sign of abating.
 ""(With global bonds), investors are protected from future
policy changes,"" Curtis said. ""They trade expensive (to local
debt) for the convenience, and also because investors are
worried there may be more capital controls coming in.""
 Volumes are still small -- $4.3 billion of global bonds have
been sold in 2010, by sovereigns including Colombia, Chile,
Brazil, Philippines and Croatia. That's just 1.5 percent of the
issuance projected for 2010 in the emerging hard currency space.
But the number is up from zero in 2009 and volumes could top
$10 billion if planned sales go ahead from Russia, Belarus and a
host of corporates. That would be the most since the 2007 peak
when $15.9 billion was issued, according to ING Bank data. 
 ""Appetite for emerging markets paper is generally very
high but the format is important. To get a bond with U.S. dollar
settlement is very attractive. Investors will pay a premium to
get bonds in a DTCC dollar-settleable format,"" said Spencer
Lake, head of debt capital markets and acquisition finance at
HSBC, which arranged bonds for Philippines and Chile.
The U.S. Depositary Trust and Clearing Corporation clears
and settles transactions between securities' buyers and sellers.
 
 WIN-WIN
 For borrowers, too, such issuance makes sense. First,
currency risk is held by investors and second, a wider investor
pool means yields are usually lower than on home bond markets.
 ""Emerging countries don't want more offshore capital in
their local jurisdiction but they do want to keep their
liabilities in local currency,"" said Jose Wynne, emerging debt
strategist at Barclays Capital in New York.
 Unlike traditional Eurobonds, which have restrictions on
selling to U.S. investors, global bonds can be sold anywhere.
They also appeal to more risk-shy investors.
 Chile for instance said its July global bond saved it $24
million in debt servicing. It placed the 10-year peso bond at a
5.5 percent yield, versus 5.7 percent for local five-year debt.
 Brazil's recent reais deal was 350 basis points tighter to
the local curve, and buyers of Philippines' debut peso bond were
happy to take 100 bps below domestic 10-year debt.
 And capital controls may also boost global issuance. That's
because taxing debt inflows leads to a jump in risk premia,
affecting the ability to raise longer-term funding at home. 
 ""You increase the barriers to entry to deter foreign
investors and then you don't have sufficient investors to buy
long-dated funding,"" RBS analyst Siobhan Morden said of Brazil's
decision last month to tap a global reais bond issued in 2007.
 ""To bypass this and to still continue to get investors for
long-dated funding they had to reopen the reais global market.""
 
 HOW SUCCESSFUL IN FUTURE?
 Obviously not all global issues will find ready buyers.
 For one, investing locally is usually more lucrative --
despite Brazil's 6 percent tax, holding 10-year local debt to
maturity yields better returns than similar-tenor global paper.
 And with demand for such debt rooted in currency
appreciation hopes, only issues denominated in strengthening
currencies are likely to do really well -- hence the success for
Chile or Colombia.
 That means weakness in Russia's weak rouble, despite high
oil prices, could make it tough for Moscow to place its upcoming
$3 billion issue at a significant discount to local bonds.
 Subsequent corporate issues may face more problems.
""The rouble has not been the best currency in emerging
markets,"" one fund manager said, explaining why he had not
touched recent corporate rouble bonds. ""You are doubling up on
your risk with a rouble bond -- corporate and currency.""

 * Data does not point to revision of Q3 GDP estimate
 
 By David Milliken and Christina Fincher
 LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - British manufacturing growth
slowed to its weakest pace in five months in September,
reinforcing fears of an economic slowdown despite a strong
performance from the broader industrial output measure.
 The figures will not alter the initial estimate of 0.8
percent GDP growth in the third quarter, but the reliance of
industrial output on robust power, gas and oil production raise
questions about the sustainability of growth going forward.
 Financial markets did not move on the data as Wednesday's
Bank of England Inflation Report is more likely to shed light on
whether a new bout of quantitative easing is still on
policymakers' agenda.
 The Office for National Statistics said industrial output
grew 0.4 percent on the month in September, in line with an
upwardly revised 0.4 percent for August and economists'
expectations.
 But manufacturing growth fell to its lowest since April,
dropping to a monthly rate of expansion of 0.1 percent from
August's upwardly revised reading of 0.4 percent.
 ""The reduced rise in manufacturing output in September fuels
suspicion that manufacturing activity will be pressurised
increasingly over the coming months,"" said IHS Global Insight
economist Howard Archer.
 Industrial output benefited from strong growth in output of
electricity, gas and water, which was up 1.4 percent on the
month, after falling 0.2 percent in August. Oil and gas
production expanded by a solid 0.9 percent.
 Britain's industrial output has bounced back strongly over
the past eight months after suffering heavily in the country's
worst recession since World War Two. Total industrial output in
the third quarter was up 4.1 percent on a year ago, the fastest
rate of growth since February 1995.
 But economists are worried that overseas demand may not be
enough to compensate for domestic headwinds next year as a
result of hefty public spending cuts, a rise in value-added tax
and job losses.
 Separate trade data also released by the ONS on Tuesday
showed the global trade gap for goods fell to its lowest since
June, but by less than expected. At 8.228 billion pounds, this
deficit is not much less than the all-time record of 8.506
billion pounds struck in July.
 ""The trade picture is not a good one,"" said Marc Ostwald, a
strategist at Monument Securities, describing the scale of the
deficit as ""still very, very ugly"".

such as Indonesia, Thailand and Mexico.
 The ministers are also expected to express concern about
trade protectionism, with the recovery from the 2008 global
financial crisis still uneven and uncertain, and once again
declare their support for the long-stalled Doha round of trade
liberalisation talks.
 ""It is time to move to the end game,"" Australian Trade
Minister Craig Emerson said on Tuesday about the Doha talks.
 An earnest call to urgently revive the comatose talks,
launched in 2001 and once targetted to end in 2005, has been an
annual feature of APEC meetings for years.
 Some APEC members see the FTAAP as the fallback option should
the Doha round ever be declared well and truly dead.
 It would be easily the world's biggest FTA. APEC economies
account for 53 percent of world economic output, 44 percent of
world trade, and 40 percent of the planet's population.
 Perry's historic voyages to Japan in the 1850s in
black-hulled steamships launched an unprecedented period of
trans-Pacific trade in the 19th century and brought Japan out of
its 200-year period of isolation.
 Proponents of an FTAAP say it would do something similar, by
preventing a line from being drawn down the middle of the Pacific
between an emerging East Asia trade group and NAFTA, or the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
 A Japanese government official said on Monday APEC officials
were debating whether to make the FTAAP a legally binding
agreement -- the first time the toothless organisation has ever
considered giving itself real powers.
 CURRENCY WARS
 The ministers are meeting ahead of a G20 summit of rich and
emerging economies in Seoul on Thursday and Friday and a weekend
summit of APEC leaders in Yokohama.
 The G20 leaders will be eager to show they have not lost the
cooperative spirit forged during the depths of the financial
crisis. The APEC leaders, for their part, always put on a show of
of solidarity and bonhomie even if their declarations are long on
rhetoric and short on substance.
 The goodwill may not last long. Plenty of fingers are being
pointed in the run-up to the meetings over what is being called
the ""currency wars"". China warned on Tuesday the U.S. Federal
Reserve's $600 billion bond-buying programme could destabilise
the global economy and inflate asset bubbles.
 Both U.S. President Barack Obama and China's President Hu
Jintao will be at the summits in Seoul and Yokohama.
 Host Japan has its own headaches with China.
 Ties have been strained since September when Japan detained a
Chinese trawler captain whose boat collided with Japanese coast
guard ships near a chain of disputed islands that are close to
vast potential oil and gas reserves.
 Japan's Prime Minister Naoto Kan has sought a bilateral
meeting with his Chinese counterparts to sort out the spat.
Beijing said on Monday it has made no plans for a meeting.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The euro extended losses on
Tuesday, under pressure over renewed concerns about peripheral
euro zone debt as some players closed long euro positions
against the dollar ahead of year-end book-closing.
 The euro fell to its lowest in over a week against the
dollar, at $1.3823, and was down 0.5 percent for the day to
trade at $1.3850. 
 Traders said there was potential for a slide to more
important support at its Oct. 20 low of $1.3697, having fallen
below support at $1.3835, the 76.4 percent retracement of its
move up the Oct. 20 low to $1.4283 on Nov. 4.
 ""We are bearish on the euro with spreads widening and
peripheral euro zone debt once again under pressure,"" said
Hans-Guenter Redeker, chief fx strategist, at BNP Paribas. 
 ""Under these circumstances the European Central Bank
speaking of normalising money market rates by January looks far
fetched. We expect the euro to fall to $1.34 by year end.""
 The cost of protecting government debt against default in
Ireland, Portugal and Spain have risen substantially in the past
week, highlighting the difficulties Europe faces with its
sovereign debt and banking problems.
 These struggles could prompt the ECB, whose President,
Jean-Claude Trichet said last week that money market conditions
were normalising, to postpone any withdrawal of emergency
measures put in place earlier this year. 
 That would reduce the scope of widening rate differentials
that could have triggered euro gains, given both the U.S.
Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan are still easing policy.
 Commerzbank analysts said bond investors had priced in a
more than 40 percent likelihood of a loss on Irish debt and of
more than 33 percent for Portugal over the next five years.
 Against this background, nervous investors will await the
outcome of the Portuguese issue of 6-and 10-year bonds on
Wednesday and any difficulties could see the euro fall more.

 HEDGE FUNDS BOOK CLOSURE AND G-20
 Traders said some macro players and Commodity Trading
Advisers, who are short-term players, were closing their long
euro and short dollar forward and futures positions ahead of
their book closing at the end of this month or next.
 Traders said Asian central banks were buying the euro
earlier in the session, but that had little impact.
 The European currency was under pressure against the yen,
shedding nearly 1 percent to 111.90 yen, triggering stop losses
at that level with more cited at 111.70 yen.
 The dollar fell 0.4 percent on the day to 80.84 yen after
earlier holding steady above 81.00, above its 1995 record low of
79.75 yen and capped at 82 yen, where offers from Japanese
corporates were seen.
 ""Unless we have new trading factors, it's hard to see the
dollar/yen rising above that level,"" said Daisuke Karakama,

 The market was also watching this week's meeting of Group of

on it. It was down 0.35 percent at $0.7842.

 * Cameron makes first visit to China since election win
 * UK won't lecture China on human rights
(Adds Cameron comments)
 By Keith Weir
 BEIJING, Nov 9, (Reuters) - British Prime Minister David
Cameron said on Tuesday he wanted to double bilateral trade with
China to more than $100 billion (62 billion pounds) a year by
2015, as he visited Beijing on Tuesday at the head of a major
trade mission.
 Cameron, making his first official visit to China since
taking office in May, said he would bring up human rights issues
with China but that it wasn't Britain's role to lecture or hector
China.
 Some rights groups have accused Britain of soft-pedalling on
sensitive political issues to avoid harming its trade prospects
with the world's second-largest economy.
 Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Cameron also called for
progress on the Doha round of world trade talks. Cameron's
36-hour visit to China comes ahead of a G20 summit in South Korea
later this week.
 ""Next year has to see the deal done, and that means action
now,"" Cameron wrote of the stalled trade talks. Britain sees a
trade deal as a way of kick-starting growth when budgets are
tight and monetary policy options limited.
 Cameron said he wanted British exports to China to account
for $30 billion of that $100 billion goal by 2015.
 Britain exported 7.7 billion pounds in goods and services to
China in 2009, while imports were 25.4 billion pounds -- a
yawning trade deficit with the world's second largest economy.
 RIGHTS ON AGENDA
 ""We want a stronger economic and business relationship with
China -- we are the fifth-largest economy in the world, but we
have only 2 percent of China's imports,"" Cameron said in a round
of interviews with British broadcasters after he arrived in
Beijing.
 ""But our dialogue is mature enough that we cover all of these
areas, including human rights,"" he added.
 Britain is competing with other Western nations in seeking to
sell more to China and its vast population.
 Cameron was meeting Premier Wen Jiabao on Tuesday and is
scheduled to have talks with President Hu Jintao on Wednesday
before travelling on to the G20 summit.
 Cameron is heading Britain's biggest ever trade delegation to
China, more than 40 business leaders seeking deals to fill order
books while the government cuts spending at home.
 A number of relatively small deals have already been
announced including measures to boost sales of Scotch whisky and
allow the import of breeding pigs into China.
 Cameron said he hoped deals worth billions of dollars would
be signed during the visit.
 He said British companies had also secured $5 billion worth
of business as part of a deal signed by China with Airbus in
France last week. Underlining the centrality of trade on the
trip, Cameron's first stop in the Beijing area was a visit to a
supermarket run by British retail company Tesco .
 Tesco plans $3 billion of investment to build new shopping
malls in China over the next 5 years. It competes with other
international food retailers such as Carrefour and Wal-Mart.
 Educational publisher Pearson also announced plans on Tuesday
to open 50 new English language centres in China, creating up to
2,000 jobs.

(Adds Hague comment on value of contracts, paragraph 6)
 By Keith Weir
 BEIJING, Nov 9 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister David
Cameron's efforts to double trade with China by 2015 received a
boost on Tuesday when aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce won a
$1.2-billion order from China Eastern Airlines.
 Cameron, making his first visit to the Asian powerhouse
since taking office in May, has targeted annual trade of more
than $100 billion with the world's second-largest economy within
five years.
 The prime minister told British reporters he would raise
human rights issues with Beijing but it wasn't Britain's role to
lecture or hector China, a one-party communist state.
 Some rights groups have accused London of soft-pedalling on
sensitive political issues to avoid harming its trade prospects.
 The Rolls-Royce order, signed in Cameron's presence, is for
Trent 700 engines to power 16 Airbus A330 aircraft and is by far
the biggest such deal sealed during a trip by the largest
British delegation ever to visit China.
 Foreign Secretary William Hague told Britain's parliament
that agreements to be signed during Cameron's trip ""may add up
to about 1.7 billion pounds of contracts."" ($2.75 billion).
 Britain is competing with other Western nations to sell more
to China and its vast population.
 China and France clinched deals valued at around $20 billion
last week during an overseas trip by President Hu Jintao, while
Germany remains by far Beijing's biggest European trade partner.
 British officials say UK-based companies would secure $5
billion worth of business as part of a deal signed by China with
Airbus in France last week.
 
 GLOBAL TRADE DEAL
 Writing in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, Cameron
called for progress on the Doha round of world trade talks, long
paralysed by disputes over farm trade centred on the United
States, China and India. His 36-hour visit to China comes ahead
of a G20 summit in South Korea starting on Thursday.
 ""Next year has to see the deal done, and that means action
now,"" Cameron wrote of the stalled trade talks. Britain sees a
trade deal as a way of kick-starting growth when budgets are
tight and monetary policy options limited.
 Cameron met Premier Wen Jiabao on Tuesday in the Great Hall
of the People and is scheduled to have talks with President Hu
on Wednesday before travelling on to the G20 summit.
 China will be hoping Britain does not bring up in public
thorny questions such as imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu
Xiaobo and other dissidents like Gao Zhisheng, and avoids too
much talk of the situation in Tibet.
 ""We want a stronger economic and business relationship with
China -- we are the fifth-largest economy in the world, but we
have only 2 percent of China's imports,"" Cameron said in a round
of interviews with British broadcasters.
 ""But our dialogue is mature enough that we cover all of
these areas, including human rights,"" he added.
 The prime minister is accompanied by four senior ministers
and more than 40 business leaders seeking deals to fill order
books while the government cuts spending at home.

524,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2010 04:24AM ET</span>","Yemen finances improved, currency to stabilise - IMF official"," * More spending, lower inflation seen
 * Economic challenges still enormous
 
 DUBAI, Nov 9 (Reuters) - An International Monetary Fund
official has praised Yemen, under U.S. pressure to battle al
Qaeda militancy in the impoverished country, over an improvement
in public finances, saying it would help stabilise its currency.
 ""Important progress was made this year to strengthen public
finances and the revenue base. This will contribute to low
inflation, greater exchange rate stability, and more investment
and pro-poor spending over the medium-term,"" Masood Ahmed,
Director of the IMF's Middle East and Central Asia Department,
said in a statement issued late on Monday.
 ""Nevertheless, the economic challenges facing Yemen are
enormous. These relate to Yemen's heavy reliance on declining
oil revenues, high unemployment, widespread poverty, and the
country's huge developmental needs.""
 The central bank has intervened several times this year to
support the rial, which hit 250 to the dollar in August, the
weakest level in its history..
 The rial has been undermined by the crippling of Yemen's
economy by constant insurgencies and a civil war as well as
massive unemployment.
 A year ago the currency stood at about 206 to the dollar.
The currency held stable in the past two months at around 215 to
the greenback, aided by central bank interventions.
 An IMF delegation met government officials, diplomats and
donor groups for regular annual consultations on Nov. 7, it
said.
 The IMF predicts real GDP growth of 8 percent in Yemen for
2010 but a drop to 4.1 percent in 2011.
 Yemen's central bank has said it expects inflation to remain
at 8 percent during 2010 and 2011. The IMF sees average
inflation of 9.8 percent in 2010 and 8.9 percent in 2011.
 The discovery last week of U.S.-bound parcels carrying bombs
from Yemen has added to investor concerns about security in the
the country which is the poorest in the Arab world. The bombs
are thought to be the work of al Qaeda's Yemen-based arm, al
Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). 
 A World Bank official told Reuters this month international
donors are finding it harder to locate investment projects in
the impoverished Arab state, crippling its efforts to diversify
its economy away from hydrocarbons. 
 Donor nations have voiced support for Yemen to help contain
the al Qaeda threat and tackle other security challenges
including conflicts with northern rebels and southern
secessionists. 
 One in three of the 23 million people suffer chronic hunger
in the Arabian Peninsula state, according to U.N. agencies.

 BEIJING, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Developing countries are facing
large inflows of capital and increasing inflationary risks,
Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan told the visiting British
finance minister George Osborne on Tuesday.
 ""The global economy is gradually recovering, but there are
still many uncertainties,"" Wang said at the opening of an

 ""Emerging economies are seeing large capital inflows and face
mounting inflationary risks. There is excessive liquidity in the
world and fluctuations in international financial markets. All

economic stimulus policies to create more money, saying they
could add pressure for more capital flows into China.

 Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced it would inject
an extra $600 billion into the U.S. banking system. Fed and
administration officials have defended the move, saying measures
to restore a strong U.S. economy were critical for global
financial stability.
 ""To promote a strong economic recovery is the top priority of
all countries,"" Wang said.
 ""The international community should continue to have a
constructive and cooperative attitude, strengthen macroeconomic
policy coordination, resist trade protectionism, avoid the
politicisation of economic issues and jointly promote strong,
sustainable and balanced growth.""
 Cameron is due to hold talks with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao
later in the day in Beijing after Osborne's meetings with Chinese
officials ahead of the G20 summit.
 ""We have a central objective to work together to resist
protectionism in all its forms, to reduce barriers to trade and
investment, to develop new markets, to expand world trade,""
Osborne said.
 The finance minister added that the G20 meetings would need
to discuss strengthening multilateral cooperation using a full
range of policies to reduce excessive imbalances.
 ""We need to move further forward in Seoul this week. I hope
that China will seize the opportunity to play a leading role on
this,"" Osborne said later after the meetings were over.

 * Deal adds to list of new customers as China exports
shrink
 * Lynas will start producing rare earths next year
(Adds details, closing share price)
 SYDNEY, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Australian rare-earths prospector
Lynas Corp  has signed a new long-term supply contract
with a European consumer, the firm said on Tuesday, amid
international concerns that China is curbing rare-earth
exports.
 China has a virtual monopoly on world supplies of rare
earths, used in everything from flat screens to defence
equipment, and its moves to restrict exports have prompted
consumer nations to look for alternative supply sources.
 Lynas said the new contract, with an unnamed buyer, was a
milestone for the company, which plans to start production next
year.
 ""Being the first new rare-earths project into production
outside China gives Lynas a significant advantage in developing
close relationships with the market consumers,"" Lynas Executive
chairman Nick Curtis said in a statement.
 Lynas has now signed six supply contracts, with the last
two struck in the past six weeks as a trade furore has erupted
over China's policy on rare-earth exports.
 Chinese customs officials have imposed broad shipment
restrictions on rare earth exports to Japan since a territorial
spat erupted in the East China Sea in September. In July, China
had said it would slash its global export quota by 40 percent.
 Lynas, which plans to refine its rare earths in Malaysia,
already has a contract with a ""major"" consumer in Japan, which
has no rare-earths resources of its own.
 The company said it was in talks with European, Japanese
and U.S. customers over additional deals.
 Lynas ended up 6 percent at A$1.26, with its announcement
of the European contract coming after the close of trading.
 China, producing 97 percent of the world's rare earths,
denies it is using the commodity as a trade weapon, saying it
needs to conserve its resources for future domestic
consumption.
 The United States and Australia are discussing how to
ensure supplies of rare earths, while South Korea, Japan and
Britain are looking as far afield as Vietnam and west Africa
for new sources.
 Another Australian prospector, Arafura Resources ,
recently signalled it was ready to press ahead on its Nolans
rare earths project after raising $88 million in a share
placement.

 * Yen gains across board, dollar back below 81.00 yen
 By Hideyuki Sano and Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The euro's losses deepened on
Tuesday as resurfacing concerns about peripheral euro zone debt
kept it under pressure, and as some players closed long euro
plays against the dollar ahead of year-end book-closing.
 The euro fell to its lowest in over a week against the
dollar, testing support at $1.3835 and with potential for a slide
to more important support at its Oct. 20 low around $1.3700.
 The dollar eased against the yen with Tokyo dealers saying
one foreign bank had been selling dollars, triggering stops
around 80.80 yen which pushed it down and wiped out some of its
strength.
 One trader said there was also talk of large accounts in Asia
selling the euro over the past day. The European currency was on
the back foot against the yen, shedding 0.7 percent after a drop
of 0.8 percent on Monday.
 The market became very short dollars ahead of last week's
Federal Reserve decision on additional bond buying and part of
the euro's falls stem from unwinding of dollar short positions,
while the market is turning whippy as liquidity thins.
 Gareth Berry, strategist at UBS in Singapore, said the market
was seeing concern about Ireland as a chance to get in and sell
the euro after its rally from $1.27 in September to a 10-month
high of $1.4283 last week.
 ""It could quickly become a dollar positive story given
positioning being the way it is,"" Berry said.
 A trader at a European bank said some macro players and
Commodity Trading Advisers, who are short-term players, are
closing their short positions in dollar forwards and futures
ahead of their book closing at the end of this month or next.
 However, they were still sticking to dollar bearish views and
were buying dollar puts at the same time to capitalise on any
further drop.

 Some say many players have not had an easy year and might
close their books earlier than normal, meaning liquidity could
thin out towards the end of the month and into early December.
 The euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.3872 , having found
some support near $1.3835, a 76.4% retracement of its move up
from $1.3697 on Oct. 20 to $1.4283 on Nov.4.
 A more important support is its Oct. 20 low of 1.3695, where
a break could signal that the currency has peaked near term.
 Against the yen, the euro shed 0.7 percent to 112.16 yen
, threatening a sustained break of major support around
112.20 yen -- the top of the cloud on the daily ichimoku chart.
 The euro also hit two-month lows versus the Aussie at
A$1.3685 .

 Worries about a political impasse in Dublin ahead of a key
budget vote saw 10-year Irish bond yields  shoot
above 8 percent on Monday -- much higher than the cost of
borrowing from the European Union's emergency fund.
 ""A clear-cut solution (and therefore a reversal in spread
widening) seems unlikely and as long as uncertainty prevails,
spreads will remain under pressure,"" said RBC Capital Markets
strategist Matthew Strauss.
 ""That is good news for USD bulls, but sombre news for risk
bulls as an escalation of these concerns could easily spill
over into broad-based risk aversion, adversely affecting
commodity currencies such as AUD and CAD.""
 The dollar index <.DXY><=USD>, a measure of its performance
against a basket of currencies, edged up 0.2 percent to 77.19.
 The dollar was still down 0.3 percent on the day at 80.95 yen
 after earlier holding steady above 81.00. It remains
within sight of its 1995 record low of 79.75 yen and capped at 82
yen, where offers from Japanese corporates were seen.
 ""Unless we have new trading factors, it's hard to see the
dollar/yen rising above that level,"" said Daisuke Karakama,
market economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank.
 The Australian dollar, which tends to suffer if risk appetite
retreats, fell 0.2 percent against the dollar  and 0.6
percent against the yen to 81.76 yen .
 But fellow high-yielder the New Zealand dollar plunged 0.8
percent to $0.7819  and 1.2 percent to 63.18 yen

kiwifruit orchard also weighed it down.

 But there is little sign of consensus and the meeting has

dollar and raised fears it may cause a destabilising flow of
money into emerging economies.
 Concerns that the Fed's aggressive easing could stoke more
inflation than it wants also helped to push spot gold  to a
record high of $1,412.75 an ounce.

 * Ireland central focus in euro zone periphery worries
 * Yen gains across board, dollar back below 81.00 yen
 By Hideyuki Sano and Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The euro's losses deepened on
Tuesday as resurfacing concerns about peripheral euro zone debt
kept it under pressure, and as short-term players closed dollar
short positions as they prepared for year-end book-closing.
 The euro dropped to its lowest in over a week against the
dollar, falling to $1.3847 with potential seen for a slide to
$1.3700, but then clawed back a bit as the yen rose suddenly on
the dollar in a move dealers said appeared driven by order flow.
 Tokyo dealers said one foreign bank had been selling the
dollar for yen, with stops around 80.80 yen triggered which
pushed it lower and wiped out some of its strength.
 Still, the euro remained on the back foot, shedding 0.7
percent on the yen after a drop of 0.8 percent on Monday.
 The market became very short dollars ahead of last week's
Federal Reserve decision on additional bond buying and part of
the euro's falls stem from unwinding of dollar short positions,
while the market is turning whippy as liquidity thins.
 Gareth Berry, strategist at UBS in Singapore, said the market
was seeing concern about Ireland as a chance to get in and sell
the euro after its rally from $1.27 in September to a 10-month
high of $1.4283 last week.
 ""It could quickly become a dollar positive story given
positioning being the way it is,"" Berry said.
 A trader at a European bank said some macro players and
Commodity Trading Advisers, who are short-term players, are
closing their short positions in dollar forwards and futures
ahead of their book closing at the end of this month or next.
 However they were still sticking to dollar bearish views and
were buying dollar puts at the same time to capitalise on any
further drop.
 The euro was down 0.2 percent at $1.3886 and 0.7 percent
lower at 112.24 yen. The euro also hit two-month lows versus the
Aussie at A$1.3692.
 EU Economics Commissioner Olli Rehn, on a visit to Ireland,
said he had not discussed any need for an EU bailout with the
country, and that he believed market confidence would be restored
once the country published its four-year plan to cut debt.
 Ireland is expected to publish details of its plan later this
month.
 Worries about a political impasse in Dublin ahead of a key
budget vote saw 10-year Irish bond yields shoot
above 8 percent on Monday -- much higher than the cost of
borrowing from the European Union's emergency fund.
 ""A clear-cut solution (and therefore a reversal in spread
widening) seems unlikely and as long as uncertainty prevails,
spreads will remain under pressure,"" said RBC Capital Markets
strategist Matthew Strauss.
 ""That is good news for USD bulls, but sombre news for risk
bulls as an escalation of these concerns could easily spill
over into broad-based risk aversion, adversely affecting
commodity currencies such as AUD and CAD.""
 The dollar index, measure of its performance against a
basket of currencies, edged up 0.2 percent to 77.09.
 The dollar was still down 0.4 percent on the day at 80.83 yen
after earlier holding steady above 81.00. It remains within sight
of its 1995 record low of 79.75 yen and capped at 82 yen, where
offers from Japanese corporates were seen.
 ""Unless we have new trading factors, it's hard to see the
dollar/yen rising above that level,"" said Daisuke Karakama,
market economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank.
 The Australian dollar, which tends to suffer if risk appetite
retreats, was steady on the day at $1.0133, having retreated from
a 28-year peak around $1.0180 set last week. But it fell 0.4
percent against the yen to 81.88 yen.
 The market is also watching this week's meeting of G20
leaders in South Korea.
 The summit has been pitched as a chance for leaders of the
countries that account for 85 percent of world output to prevent
a currency row escalating into a rush to protectionism that could
imperil the global recovery.
 But there is little sign of consensus and the meeting has
been overshadowed by disagreements over the Fed's quantitative
easing policy. The move has helped depress the dollar and raised
fears it may cause a destabilising flow of money into emerging
economies.
 ""I think they'll struggle to come up with any substantive
plan,"" said Grant Turley, strategist at ANZ in Sydney.

when their leaders meet this week at the Asia-Pacific Economic

 Production of rare earths, used in range of high-tech

States and Japan to loosen export constraints.
 ""The Japanese and U.S. foreign ministers have agreed that the

restrictions on rare earth exports to Japan since a spat over a

collided with Japanese patrol boats near disputed islands in the
East China Sea in September. He was later released and sent home.
 The incident followed China's announcement in July that it
would slash its export quota by 40 percent for rare earths.
 China, which accounts for 97 percent of the global output of

 By Daniel Magnowski
 SINGAPORE, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The euro extended its losses
on Tuesday on renewed concerns about high sovereign debt in the
euro zone, providing further respite for the dollar and
prompting some profit-taking in stocks.
 European shares were flat at the open, subdued by losses on
Wall Street and Asia as investors focused on a batch of
European corporate results due later in the day.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 and Britain's FTSE 100 were little
changed. Germany's DAX and France's CAC-40 were marginally
lower.
 Gold added to a record breaking run, hitting a new high
above $1,400 an ounce as investors sought safe havens in the
face of a number of uncertainties, including the euro-area debt
concerns and this week's G20 leaders' summit.
 The euro, trading down 0.2 percent at $1.3866 by 0735 GMT,
has dropped 3 percent against the dollar from a 9-½ month
high set last week and against the yen has slipped to a
one-week low, although some forecast limited downside.
""We've probably seen a short-term top in the euro,"" said Grant
Turley, strategist at ANZ in Sydney, adding it was a mild
corrective move and unlikely to worsen unless concerns over the
euro zone's sovereign debt intensify.
 Ireland is the latest country to rattle the single
currency, with Irish borrowing costs extending a month-long
climb on worries about a political impasse in Dublin ahead of a
budget vote.
 The yield on Irish 10-year bonds hit 8 percent for the
first time on Monday.
 Adding to the market's cautious tone, top officials at the
U.S. Federal Reserve offered differing assessments of the
central bank's $600 billion bond-buying programme announced
last week.
 One argued it was an effective way to offset deflation
risks and another warned it might need to be curbed to head-off
inflationary pressures.
 Another uncertainty for markets is a G20 leaders' meeting
this week in South Korea, where currency tensions loom large as
reflected in criticism of the Fed's monetary easing.
 ""The market is also going to be wary ahead of G20 but I
think they'll struggle to come up with any substantive plan,""
ANZ's Turley said.
 PROFITS
 Investors in stock markets, cautious after recent rises,
chose to bank gains.
 The benchmark Nikkei average closed down 0.4 percent after
it had risen more than 6 percent in the past four sessions and
to a three-month high on Monday.
 ""It's about time to take profits as the Nikkei has rapidly
climbed above 9,700, which is the upper end of its recent
range, so the market became cautious about buying further,""
said Tomomi Yamashita, a fund manager at Shinkin Asset
Management.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan eased
0.4 percent.
 Since September, when investors began to price in that the
Fed's efforts to print more cash would lead to more capital
inflows into fast-growing Asia, the index has outperformed the
MSCI world benchmark, with gains of 21 percent versus 18
percent.
 In market news, a source told Reuters that the founder of
China's largest e-commerce company Alibaba Group had been
approached by private equity investors to gauge his interest in
taking part in a bid for Yahoo Inc.
 The G20 summit has been pitched as a chance for leaders of
the world's advanced and developing economies to stop a
currency row from spiralling into trade-damaging protectionism,
but there is little sign of consensus.
 That is leading investors to seek out safe haven
investments.
 Gold hit a record high of $1,414.60 per ounce and palladium
rose to a nine-year peak.
 Spot silver hit a fresh 30-year high for a fourth straight
session, exceeding $28 per ounce, though support for the dollar
weighed on broader commodity markets.
 U.S. crude futures fell 21 cents to $86.85 per barrel
following six straight sessions of rises.

 * Brazil aims to boost ties in face of Asian competition
 * Lack of support from Mexican business could scuttle deal
(Adds comment from Mexican economy minister)
 By Ana Nicolaci da Costa and Michael O'Boyle
 SAO PAULO/MEXICO CITY, Nov 8 (Reuters)- Brazil and Mexico
said on Monday they would work towards a trade deal to tie
Latin America's top two economies more closely together, boost
tiny trade flows and confront rising global competition.
 The agreement follows more than a decade of attempts to
deepen ties between the two countries, whose business sectors
are separated by language and cultural differences - as well as
long-standing distrust and regional rivalries.
 The countries face tough negotiations ahead to hash out the
final agreement, but Brazil's Foreign Trade Secretary Welber
Barral said officials hoped to have a deal in place by 2012.
 ""The objective is economic integration between the two
countries,"" Barral told Reuters.
 Besides seeking to eliminate tariffs, the deal would also
include investment, government procurement and intellectual
property rights, the governments said in a joint statement.
 Agriculture, though, will remain outside the main
negotiations, said Mexican Economy Secretary Bruno Ferrari.
 Past efforts to lower tariffs have worried Mexican farmers,
who feel they can not stand up to Brazil's agricultural might.
 ""That will be a parallel discussion because it is a very
sensitive area,"" Ferrari told reporters, describing as
""sensitive"" the textile and footwear sectors.
 Ferrari said the chemical, electronics, tourism, energy,
banking and automotive industries are some of the areas of
opportunity for both countries.
 Bilateral trade between Mexico and Brazil totaled $5.9
billion in 2009 -- only a little more than 1 percent of
Mexico's total trade, which is primarily with the United
States.
 Brazil's commerce is focused on China, its South American
neighbors and Europe. Mexico and Brazil already have a limited
trade deal in place.
 Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva called the
size of the countries' trade balance ""a disgrace"" back in
February when he and Mexican President Felipe Calderon launched
the idea of a trade deal.
 Mexico is keen to diversify its trade after it suffered one
of the worst recessions due to its dependence on the U.S.
market, which buys about 80 percent of local exports.
 Lula worked to improve relations with Mexico during his
term, and analysts said the timing of the talks signaled
Brazil's desire to keep up relations with Mexico as
president-elect Dilma Rousseff prepares to take over in 2011.
 Brazil's Barral said Latin America needed to band together
to face off increasing competition from cheaper Asian goods.
 Mexico has fallen behind Brazil in part because a bitterly
divided Congress has failed to pass substantive reforms to
outdated tax, energy and labor laws, and an upcoming
presidential race could scuttle chances for a far-reaching
deal, analysts said.
 Any deal hashed out by the two administrations would still
have to be ratified by their respective national legislatures.
 Political parties in Mexico are already jockeying ahead of
presidential elections in 2012, and analysts said Calderon may
not be able to muster the political support to approve a

 SAO PAULO/MEXICO CITY, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Latin American
stocks fell on Monday as talk of government pressure on
Brazil's central bank to cut interest rates weighed on banking
and real estate shares.
 A pledge from the U.S. Federal Reserve to keep interest
rates near record lows was also viewed as hurting bank profits
in the United States. [ID:nN08222161].

 * Euro unglued on Irish debt concern
 * Gold tops $1,400 an ounce for fresh record high
(Updates with U.S. close)
 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - World stocks weakened on Monday
as renewed European debt concerns and a sign of recovery for
the U.S. labor market sent the euro reeling versus the dollar,
while gold surged on inflation worry.
 Newspaper reports raising fresh doubts about Ireland's
ability to fund itself internationally have weighed on the euro
and caused spreads between Irish and German government bond
yields to widen.
 Skepticism over Europe's fiscal troubles eased pressure on
the dollar, which had endured weeks of selling on expectations
of huge monetary easing by the Federal Reserve. Friday's
stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report eased concern that the
Fed would go beyond the $600 billion in Treasury purchases on
which it decided.
 ""We're finally seeing the market turn its gaze away from
Fed easing and toward these ongoing problems in peripheral
Europe,"" said Matthew Strauss, senior strategist at RBC Capital
Markets in Toronto.
 ""Even before the Fed meeting, spreads for Ireland, Greece
and Portugal were widening, and now that the Fed has indicated
what it will do, the market is starting to trade on these
worries.""
 While Ireland does not face any immediate liquidity demands
-- it is fully funded until the middle of next year -- there
are real concerns that if Prime Minister Brian Cowen fails to
get his 2011 budget passed in December, the country will be
unable to return to the bond markets, as planned, in January.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 0.2
percent after rising last week to levels last reached prior to
the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
 Trading in Tokyo was poised to open slightly lower, with
the December futures contract that trades in Chicago for the
Nikkei 225 <0#NK:> down 20 points at 9,705.
 Spot gold surged to a record high $1,410.30 an ounce as
investors bought the precious metal as an inflation hedge.
Gold has risen almost 6 percent since just before the Fed
detailed its plans for more ""quantitative easing.""
 ""People have gotten to the point that they have lost
confidence in the fiat currencies and they are choosing gold as
their currency of choice,"" said Michael Daly, gold specialist
at futures broker PFGBest.
 On Wall Street, stocks maintained an inverse relationship
with the dollar, which had slumped to a 9-1/2 month low against
the euro on concern the Fed stimulus would fuel inflation.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 37.24 points,
or 0.33 percent, to 11,406.84. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> edged lower by 2.60 points, or 0.21 percent, at 1,223.25
and the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> managed a gain of 1.07
points to 2,580.05.
 The S&P 500 had risen for five straight weeks and nine of
the past 10, supported by the Fed's efforts to lower interest
rates and reinvigorate a sluggish economy. With valuations at
recent highs, investors booked profits.
 U.S. financial stocks were among the biggest losers. The
S&P financial index <.GSPF> declined 0.77 percent, weighed down
by a 0.7 percent decline in shares of Wells Fargo & Co 
and a 1.6 percent drop in State Street Corp .
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
slipped 0.4 percent, with investors cashing in on six-month
high prices reached on Friday.
 ""Some degree of profit-taking doesn't come as a surprise
after a gain of about 15 percent since late August. The market
might lack a little bit of direction for the first day or two
of the week,"" said Keith Bowman, analyst at Hargreaves
Lansdown.
 Metals prices slipped as the dollar rose, while oil futures
 were little changed at $86.90 a barrel. Shares of Alcoa
Inc , the largest U.S. aluminum producer, fell 0.3
percent to $13.96.
 The dollar had been weakening as a result of the Fed's
money-printing stimulus.
 On Monday, however, the U.S. currency was up 0.63 percent
against major currencies <.DXY>, recouping recent losses
following the surprisingly strong U.S jobs data.
 The euro was notably weak, down 0.79 percent at $1.3920
. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down
0.11 percent at 81.16 yen.
 The premium that investors demand to hold Irish debt over
benchmark German bunds rose on Monday, extending a month-long
climb that has seen Irish borrowing costs reach record highs on
a near daily basis.
 U.S. government debt prices were mostly lower, with the
benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rising 0.01 percentage
point to 2.55 percent. Shorter-term yields rose as the Treasury
auctioned $32 billion in three-year notes.
 In other stock markets, the Athens bourse's banking index
<.FTATBNK> jumped 2.5 percent after results of local elections
ruled out a snap general election in the economically strapped
euro zone country.

 LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Greece is not considering
restructuring its debt, its finance minister said on Monday,
adding that regional elections the previous day showed the
government has the support needed to push on with fiscal
reform.
 ""We have said very clearly there is no issue of debt
restructuring on the table,"" Finance Minister George
Papaconstantinou told reporters following a speech in London.
 His comments came after Prime Minister George Papandreou
ruled out calling a snap election on Sunday after his party
eked out a narrow election victory. For more, see:
[ID:nLDE6A70Y7]
 Papandreou's win was seen as a sign that Greece does not
want another general vote as it struggles with debt issues.
 ""The election yesterday showed that we continue to have a
clear mandate for reform,"" Papaconstantinou said.
 The spread between 10-year Greek and German government
bonds was around 900 basis points on Monday, narrowing from
late last week as investors were heartened by the Greek vote
results.
 Yield spreads between 10-year periphery euro zone bonds and
benchmark German debt have blown out in the past week as
concerns resurface about fiscal problems in Ireland and
Portugal.
 Greek yield spreads also expanded last week, before
narrowing slightly on Monday.
 Papaconstantinou said the widening yield spreads reflected
concerns about the euro zone periphery in general, adding that
Greece is shielded from market volatility so long as it
fulfills its end of the IMF/EU's 110 billion euro rescue deal.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the U.S.
dollar for a second straight session on Monday as budget
problems in Ireland and euro zone debt issues prompted
investors to seek safety in the greenback.
 The euro, which fell Friday after a stronger-than-expected
U.S. jobs report, extended losses Monday on Europe's sovereign
debt concerns.
 The dollar had slipped to a 9-1/2-month low against the
euro after the Federal Reserve last Wednesday said it would buy
$600 billion of Treasuries by mid-2011 to lower interest rates
and reinvigorate a sluggish economy.
 The euro was last down 0.8 percent at $1.3917, and traders
said a break through support around $1.3860, its low so far
this month, could trigger a near-term move toward $1.37. It
also fell 0.9 percent to 112.95 yen.
 ""Fears are escalating over sovereign debt issues in the
euro zone, and the euro breaking below $1.40 is a substantial
move,"" said Camilla Sutton, currency strategist at Scotia
Capital in Toronto, Canada.
 ""Having said that, I believe the euro's weakness is only a
temporary move and we will revert back to dollar weakness,"" she
said. Fed easing ""will continue to put downward pressure on the
dollar into the year end as well as next year.""
 The shape of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, meanwhile, is
depicting concern over long-term U.S. dollar value, Sutton
added.
 The U.S. Treasury yield curve steepened to record levels
early on Monday amid continued fallout from the Federal
Reserve's plan to extend its bond buying program.
 But profit-taking eventually turned longer-dated debt
prices positive and narrowed the yield gap between long bonds
and 10-year Treasury notes.
 The steepness of the yield curve speaks to the longer-term
risks inherent in Fed easing and the building unattractiveness
of U.S. dollar denominated assets, she said.
 For now, though, markets were focused on debt problems in
Ireland. Although the government is funded until early 2011, an
Irish newspaper report questioned the government's ability to
cut spending next year, casting doubt on future demand for
Irish debt.
 The cost of protecting Irish government debt against
default rose on Monday as did equivalent insurance for Spain.
 China said over the weekend it would help Portugal, another
euro zone country with strained public finances, cope with the
crisis, but made no promises about buying Portuguese government
bonds. China has promised to buy Greek bonds in the future.
 Weak German industrial output data also hurt the euro,
while a general move away from risk weakened the Australian
dollar, which fell 0.3 percent to $1.0129, off Friday's 28-year
peak of $1.0183. The New Zealand dollar fell 1.1 percent to
$0.7876.
 The U.S. dollar was last down 0.1 percent at 81.16 yen.
 G20, IRELAND MAY ADD DRAMA
 Analysts said European debt fears also provided an
opportunity to trim bets against the dollar, which remained at
an elevated level in the latest week.
 Beyond short-covering, the dollar faces an uphill climb
against most major currencies and emerging market currencies.
 While recent jobs data was surprisingly strong, analysts
said the economy has yet to show it can sustain such strength.
 Sutton expects the euro to reach $1.43 at year-end.
 The Fed's decision to pump more money into the U.S. economy
has certainly irked developing and some developed countries who
fear the money will stoke inflation outside U.S. borders.
Germany's finance minister called U.S. monetary policy
""clueless.""
 The issue will probably feature at a Group of 20 meeting in
Seoul this week that may address global economic imbalances.
 But if worries about euro zone debt issues mount, Michael
Woolfolk, strategist at BNY Mellon in New York, said it could
be a repeat of events last November, when debt worries in Dubai
and Greece sparked a safe-haven rush into dollars.
 ""Last year, people closed their books early, took profits,
and bought dollars,"" he said. ""This year, Ireland suggests
there is still smoke emanating from the European sovereign debt
crisis, and if it turns into a fire, it's quite possible that
the overbought euro will suffer again.""

 * Bullard sees program as effective as traditional policy
 * Warsh: program could be curtailed if inflation threatens
 * Fisher: fiscal, regulatory ills need to be addressed
 By Kristina Cooke
 NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Top officials at the U.S.
Federal Reserve on Monday sounded differing notes on the
central bank's bond-buying program, with one arguing it was an
effective way to fight deflation risks and another warning it
might need to be curbed.
 The remarks from St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President
James Bullard, Dallas Fed chief Richard Fisher, Fed Governor
Kevin Warsh and Thomas Hoenig of the Kansas City Fed
underscored tensions within the central bank over the wisdom of
the decision to buy a further $600 billion in government debt.
 ""While this policy carries both risks and rewards ... the
benefits outweigh the risks,"" Bullard told a group of
securities analysts in New York.
 He said worries the policy could create high inflation down
the road were ""legitimate and important,"" but added that the
disinflationary trend ""is worrisome right now.""
 The central bank's decision has sparked an unusually vocal
public debate among Fed officials, while drawing the ire of
many other nations, which worry the United States is
deliberately undercutting the dollar.
 Warsh, who like Bullard backed the new Fed program in a
vote last week, expressed concern about the decision. He said
he would have preferred the adoption of ""pro-growth fiscal,
regulatory and trade policies"" to spur growth.
 Fisher said the program would only work if lawmakers
addressed the fiscal and regulatory uncertainties that he said
were holding back businesses from expanding.
 ""I would suggest that even if you share my cautious
perspective on this matter, you might be assuaged by looking at
this new initiative as a bridge loan to fiscal sanity,"" he told
a meeting of financial professionals in San Antonio.
 Warsh emphasized that the policy would be subject to
regular review and adjusted if needed, and he raised the
prospect that rising inflation risks could lead the central
bank to curb the program even with unemployment still painfully
high.
 ""If the recent weakness in the dollar, run-up in commodity
prices and other forward-looking indicators are sustained and
passed along into final prices, the Fed's price stability
objective might no longer be a compelling policy rationale,"" he
said.
 ""Policies should be altered if certain objectives are
satisfied, purported benefits disappoint, or potential risks
threaten to materialize,"" Warsh said.
 However, Bullard said his best guess was that the full
amount would be purchased by mid-2011, as announced. ""Given the
outlook now ... it looks like we will follow through on that
and reassess at that point,"" he said in an interview with
Market News International published on Monday.
 CRITICS ABOUND
 Many economists think the Fed could eventually decide to
push beyond the $600 billion in purchases announced last week,
notwithstanding differing views within the central bank.
[FED/R]
 Bullard said the U.S. recovery had slowed, putting it in a
disinflationary trend that needed to be addressed to avoid a
debilitating bout of deflation. He said the unconventional
bond-buying program should prove as effective as traditional
policy.
 Warsh, likewise, said the economy's performance has been
unimpressive. In contrast, Hoenig, the only official to vote
against the Fed's decision last week, emphasized his view that
the conditions were already in place for a quickening of
economic growth.
 The Fed's decision to add to the $1.7 trillion in
government and mortgage-related debt it has already bought has
driven down the value of the dollar and drawn scathing comments
from countries that see the United States pushing for an export
edge.
 In response to an audience question about complaints by
countries such as China and Germany about the Fed's decision,
Bullard said the U.S. central bank must act to fulfill its
mandate of price stability and full employment.
 ""You can't have other people around the world calling the
shots on that mandate,"" he said.
 Warsh, however, said heightened tensions in currency and
capital markets raised the risk of a more difficult and
protracted global economic recovery, and said these long-term
risks need to be taken into account.
 ""Should these risks threaten to materialize, however one
gauges the probabilities, I am confident that the (Fed) will
have the tools and conviction to adjust policies
appropriately,"" he said.

 NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the U.S.

problems in Ireland and euro zone debt issues prompted
investors to seek safety in the greenback.
 The euro, which fell Friday after a stronger-than-expected

$600 billion of Treasuries by mid-2011 to lower interest rates
and reinvigorate a sluggish economy.
 The Fed's asset purchases are tantamount to printing more
money, which pushes down the value of the dollar. However, some
say this factor is already priced into the market and that has
allowed investors to focus on other issues.
 The euro was last down 0.7 percent at $1.3935 , and
traders said a break through support around $1.3860, its low so
far this month, could trigger a near-term move toward $1.37. It
also fell 0.8 percent to 113.13 yen .
 ""Fears are escalating over sovereign debt issues in the

 The agreement caps more than a decade of attempts to deepen

 By Justyna Pawlak
 BRUSSELS, Nov 8 (Reuters) - European Union member countries
agreed on Monday to tighten aviation security measures after
bombs were found in air cargo bound for the United States.
 Home affairs ministers meeting in Brussels set up an expert
group to prepare specific recommendations that may include
drawing up a list of ""unsafe"" airports, as proposed by Germany.
 In recent weeks, parcel bombs have been sent from Yemen to
targets in the United States, and by militants in Greece to
embassies and EU governments, including German Chancellor Angela
Merkel's office.
 Belgium, which holds the rotating EU presidency until the
end of the year, said the threat of further attacks required a
coordinated approach.
 ""If you look at what happened in recent weeks, it is fair to
say there is still a threat. We have been lucky the attacks were
successfully thwarted,"" Belgian Home Affairs Minister Annemie
Turtelboom told reporters after the meeting.
 The expert group will draw up proposals by Dec. 2 to be
discussed by EU transport and interior ministers.
 Last week, EU Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas urged a
proportionate approach to air cargo screening to avoid stifling
trade.
 The EU's existing rules require extra security checks for
cargo not processed by firms that have passed a standards test.
 Germany proposed additional measures such as increased
coordination of security checks and a blacklist of airports.
 Turtelboom said the expert group would look into the
possibility of drawing up a security checklist for airports but
that there was no agreement on whether to create a blacklist.
 ""We are going to see who can help airports in non-EU
countries ... give them a checklist or a risk analysis to
determine which airport is clean,"" she said.
 Ten EU airports are among the 20 top cargo hubs in the
world.

 * Industry says new science is insufficiently robust
 * EU Commission says not yet time to change policy
 
 (Adds European Commission and Novozymes comments)
 By Pete Harrison
 BRUSSELS, Nov 8 (Reuters) - European plans to promote
biofuels will drive farmers to convert 69,000 square km of wild
land into fields and plantations, depriving the poor of food and
accelerating climate change, a report by green groups warned.
 That estimated area equals the size of the Republic of
Ireland.
 As a result, the extra biofuels that Europe will use over
the next decade will generate between 81 and 167 percent more
carbon dioxide than fossil fuels, the report said on Monday.
 Nine environmental groups reached this conclusion after
analysing official data on the European Union's goal of getting
10 percent of transport fuel from renewable sources by 2020.
 But the European Commission's energy team, which originally
formulated the goal, countered that the bulk of the land needed
would be found by cultivating abandoned farmland in Europe and
Asia, minimising the impact.
 New science has emerged this year casting doubt on the
sustainability of the 10 percent goal, but EU energy officials
have argued that only around two thirds of that target will be
met through biofuels, with the balance coming from the powering
of vehicles by renewable electricity.
 But 23 of the EU's 27 member states have now published their
national strategies for renewable energy, revealing that fully
9.5 percent of transport fuel will be biofuel in 2020, 90
percent of which will come from food crops, the report says.
 ""Most see quite a high level of contribution from biomass
and from biofuel,"" Philip Lowe, director general of the European
Commission's energy team, told Reuters. Lowe's team is currently
studying whether or not to tweak legislation to take account of
the emerging science.
 ""I think it's too early to judge whether the 10 percent
objective should be reviewed or not,"" he added.
 This year's fractious quest to understand the impact of EU
biofuels policy has already led to allegations of bias, court
action against the Commission and warnings that the probes will
kill the nascent industry.
 
 TRADE DISPUTE
 The debate centres on a new concept known as ""indirect
land-use change"".
 In essence, that means that if you take a field of grain and
switch the crop to biofuel, somebody, somewhere, will go hungry
unless those missing tonnes of grain are grown elsewhere.
 The crops to make up the shortfall could come from anywhere,
and economics often dictate that will be in tropical zones,
encouraging farmers to hack out new land from fertile forests.
 Burning forests to clear that land can pump vast quantities
of climate-warming emissions into the atmosphere, enough to
cancel out any of the benefits the biofuels were meant to bring.
 The indirect effects of the EU's biofuel strategy will
generate an extra 27-56 million tonnes of greenhouse gas
emissions per year, says the report. In the worst case, that
would be the equivalent of putting another 26 million cars on
Europe's roads, it added.
 The UK, Spain, Germany, Italy and France are projected to
produce the most extra greenhouse gas emissions from biofuels,
generating up to 13.3, 9.5, 8.6, 5.3 and 3.9 extra million
tonnes of carbon dioxide per year respectively.
 But the whole picture is far more complex.
 The European Commission's energy team says shortfalls in
grain can be avoided in several ways, including by improving
farming yields and cultivating abandoned land.
 Traditional biofuel producers also argue that EU officials
should not alter biofuel-promoting policies to take account of
the new science, because it is still too uncertain.
 ""Any public policy based on such highly debatable results
would be easily challengeable at the World Trade Organisation,""
says Emmanuel Desplechin, of the Brazilian Sugarcane Industry
Association (UNICA).
 Denmark's Novozymes said it had already created a biofuel
from straw, which is now available at Danish fuel pumps and does
less indirect damage.
 The EU should tweak policy to ensure the promotion of such
""second-generation"" biofuels, Novozymes added.

(Updates with European stocks' close)
 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Stocks fell on Monday as
renewed concerns about Ireland's resolve to address its debt
load dragged the euro lower and gave the dollar a reprieve from
weeks of drubbing, but gold surged on inflation worry.
 Newspaper reports raising fresh doubts about Ireland's
ability to fund itself internationally have weighed on the euro
and caused spreads between Irish and German government bond
yields to widen.
 This eased pressure on the dollar, which had endured weeks
of selling amid expectations that the Federal Reserve would
embark on a huge monetary stimulus in the form of U.S. debt
purchases. The Fed last week affirmed the speculation, with the
announcement of another $600 billion in quantitative easing.
 But a stronger-than-expected U.S. labor market report on
Friday eased concern of extensive Fed easing.
 ""We're finally seeing the market turn its gaze away from
Fed easing and toward these ongoing problems in peripheral
Europe,"" said Matthew Strauss, senior strategist at RBC Capital
Markets in Toronto.
 ""Even before the Fed meeting, spreads for Ireland, Greece,
Portugal were widening, and now that the Fed has indicated what
it will do, the market is starting to trade on these worries.""
 While Ireland does not face any immediate liquidity demands
-- it is fully funded until the middle of next year -- there
are real concerns that if Prime Minister Brian Cowen fails to
get his 2011 budget passed in December, the country will be
unable to return to the bond markets, as planned, in January.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 0.2
percent after rising last week to levels last reached prior to
the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
 On Wall Street, stocks maintained an inverse relationship
with the dollar, which had slumped to a 9-1/2 month low against
the euro on concern the Fed stimulus would fuel inflation. Spot
gold surged to a record high $1,402 an ounce as investors
bought the precious metal as an inflation hedge.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 43.90 points,
or 0.38 percent, at 11,400.18. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> declined 3.96 points, or 0.32 percent, at 1,221.89 and
the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was flat at 2,578.86.
 U.S. financial stocks were among the biggest losers. The
S&P financial index <.GSPF> declined 0.7 percent, weighed down
by a 1 percent decline in shares of Wells Fargo & Co 
and a 1.9 percent drop in State Street Corp .
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
ended a tad lower, with investors cashing in on six-month high
prices reached on Friday.
 ""Some degree of profit-taking doesn't come as a surprise
after a gain of about 15 percent since late August. The market
might lack a little bit of direction for the first day or two
of the week,"" said Keith Bowman, analyst at Hargreaves
Lansdown.
 Metals prices slipped as the dollar rose, while oil futures
 fell 0.21 percent to $86.67 a barrel, easing from
two-year highs earlier in the session. Shares of Alcoa Inc
, the largest U.S. aluminum producer, fell 0.9 percent to
$13.88.
 The dollar has been weakening as a result of the Fed's
quantitative easing, a form of money-printing stimulus.
 On Monday, however, the U.S. currency was up 0.53 percent
against major currencies <.DXY>, recouping recent losses
following the surprisingly strong U.S jobs data.
 The euro was notably weak, down 0.7 percent at $1.3934
. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down
0.14 percent at 81.14 yen.
 The premium that investors demand to hold Irish debt over
benchmark German bunds rose on Monday, extending a month-long
climb that has seen Irish borrowing costs reach record highs on
a near daily basis.
 U.S. government debt prices were mostly lower, with the
benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury down 4/32 and the yield at 2.55
percent. Shorter-term yields edged higher ahead of the
Treasury's $32 billion three-year note auction.
 In other stock markets, the Athens bourse's banking index
<.FTATBNK> jumped 2.5 percent after results of local elections
ruled out a snap general election in the economically strapped
euro zone country.
 The Nikkei average <.N225> climbed 1.1 percent to a

 * Sanofi still interested in working with Genzyme on deal
 * Sanofi shares up 0.1 percent, Genzyme down 0.9 percent

(Adds share prices, background)
 By Helen Massy-Beresford 
 PARIS, Nov 8 (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis
said it has called on bid target Genzyme not to use defensive
tactics to block a takeover of the U.S. biotech but to let
shareholders decide on its $18.5 billion offer.
 Sanofi Chief Executive Chris Viehbacher said in a letter to
Genzyme CEO Henri Termeer published on Monday that the board
should not stand in the way of shareholder choice if it was not
prepared to enter direct talks with the French group.
 ""You have publicly disclosed that Genzyme's board has
authorised management and the company's advisors to 'probe and
evaluate alternatives' for Genzyme and its assets, including
contacting third parties,"" Viehbacher said.
 ""We were encouraged to hear this, but to date, we have not
been contacted or included in this process,"" Viehbacher added in
the letter, which was dated Nov. 8.
 Viehbacher said certain comments made by Genzyme management
seemed to be inconsistent with its publicly stated aim of
maximising shareholder returns and listening to shareholders.
 Sanofi said the comments referred to three possible courses
of action for Genzyme: extending the terms of some of its
directors, using Massachusetts anti-takeover statutes to block a
deal or adopting a ""poison pill"" to stop Sanofi taking control.
 ""We believe it would be inappropriate for the board to take
these defensive actions,"" Viehbacher said.
 ""If we are unable to have a direct dialogue with you, in all
fairness you should allow your shareholders the opportunity to
decide for themselves whether or not to accept our proposal.""
Sanofi has stuck to its bid for Genzyme after the U.S.
company held a series of meetings to demonstrate it was worth
more than the $69 per share Sanofi has offered, citing sales of
$3 billion for its experimental multiple sclerosis drug.
Genzyme executives have said their earnings forecast for next
year implied a price as high as $89 per share, based on the
multiple underlying Sanofi's hostile $69 per share offer. Sanofi
has called $89 per share ""totally unrealistic"".
 ""This is still a game of cat and mouse. The group is putting
pressure on shareholders and indirectly on the board by making
this public. He who dares wins,"" said one analyst who asked not
to be named.
 Sanofi said in a statement accompanying the letter that it
remained interested in working with Genzyme on a constructive
basis and was committed to a mutually agreeable transaction.
 ""Let's be frank, what is the issue here, it's pricing,"" Kris
Jenner, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price Health Sciences
Fund, told the Reuters Health Summit in New York on Monday.
 ""It's going to be somewhere between what Sanofi wants to pay
and what Genzyme wants them to pay. My sense is that anywhere
between $75-$80 (per share) seems perfectly reasonable...I think
Sanofi will prevail but they will prevail at a higher price.""
 Genzyme officials have not been in contact with Sanofi since
the French drugmaker launched its hostile bid on Oct. 4.
Sanofi shares closed little changed at 51.03 euros, while
Genzyme shares were down 0.9 percent at $71.05 by 1644 GMT.

 * Euro down as worries resurface about Ireland

 * Friday's robust U.S. jobs numbers support dollar
 (Updates prices, adds comment, adds detail)
 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Monday as
investors fretted anew about budget problems in Ireland and
some of the euro zone's other weaker links and trimmed recent
bets against the U.S. dollar.
 Last week's surprisingly strong U.S. jobs data also
prompted investors to buy the dollar. The greenback has slipped
to a 9-1/2 month low against the euro after the Federal Reserve
said it would buy $600 billion of Treasuries by mid-2011 to
lower interest rates and reinvigorate a sluggish economy.
 The euro fell 0.9 percent to $1.3905, and traders said a
break through support around $1.3860, its low so far this
month, could trigger a near-term move toward $1.37. It also
fell 1 percent to 112.88 yen.
 ""We're finally seeing the market turn its gaze away from
Fed easing and toward these ongoing problems in peripheral
Europe,"" said Matthew Strauss, senior strategist at RBC Capital
Markets in Toronto. ""Even before the Fed meeting, spreads for
Ireland, Greece, Portugal were widening, and now that the Fed
has indicated what it will do, the market is starting to trade
on these worries.""
 Current market anxiety was focused mainly on Ireland.
Although the government is funded until early 2011, a local
newspaper report questioned its ability to cut spending next
year, casting doubt on future demand for government debt.
 The cost of protecting Irish government debt against
default rose on Monday, as did equivalent insurance for Spain.
 China said over the weekend it would help Portugal, another
euro zone country with strained public finances, cope with the
crisis but made no promises about buying Portuguese government
bonds. China has promised to buy Greek bonds in the future.
 Weak German industrial output data also hurt the euro,
while a general move away from risk weakened the Australian
dollar, which fell 0.4 percent to $1.0113, off Friday's 28-year
peak of $1.0183. The New Zealand dollar fell 1.1 percent to
$0.7881.
 The U.S. dollar was off 0.1 percent at 81.17 yen.
 G20, IRELAND MAY ADD DRAMA AS 2010 FADES
 The dollar still faces an uphill climb against most major
currencies and emerging market currencies, traders said.
 While recent jobs data as well as reports on manufacturing
and service sector growth were surprisingly strong, analysts
said the economy has yet to show it can sustain such strength.
 There's also the matter of the Fed's promised bond buying
to the tune of about $75 billion per month, which will keep
interest rates low and dull the dollar's global appeal.
 ""It's difficult to imagine a larger-than-expected easing
operation being viewed as anything but dollar-negative,"" said
BNY Mellon strategist Michael Woolfolk. ""But the short dollar
trade is overcrowded, so people may take some profits to set
themselves up to take another swipe at the dollar later."" 
 Commodity and Futures Trading Commission data last week
showed speculators had increased dollar short positions in
anticipation of more Fed easing.
 The Fed's decision to pump more money into the U.S. economy
irked developing and some developed countries who fear the
money will stoke inflation outside U.S. borders, where returns
on global investment are higher. Germany's finance minister
called U.S. monetary policy ""clueless.""
 But China appeared to temper its criticism over the
weekend, saying the Fed's policy would help the world economy
by boosting U.S. growth.
 The issue will probably feature at a Group of 20 meeting in
Seoul this week that may address global economic imbalances.
 But if worries about euro zone debt issues mount, some said
the dollar may rise as global investors exit riskier trades.
 Woolfolk said it could be a repeat of events last November,
when debt worries in Dubai and Greece sparked a safe-haven rush
into dollars.
 ""Last year, people closed their books early, took profits,
and bought dollars,"" he said. ""This year, Ireland suggests
there is still smoke emanating from the European sovereign debt
crisis, and if it turns into a fire, it's quite possible that
an overbought euro will suffer again.""

579,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2010 11:44AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Zoellick's currency plan highlights dollar angst," * Zoellick idea reflects global angst at weak dollar and QE2
 * Currency cooperation to loom large in French G20 agenda
 * Experts see gold anchor role as unfeasible
 By Paul Taylor
 PARIS, Nov 8 (Reuters) - World Bank President Robert
Zoellick's surprise call for a new global currency system with
gold as a reference point highlights the depth of unease about a
weakening dollar that is fuelling trade and currency tensions.
 It may be aimed more at drawing China into the international
monetary system than at actually reverting to an anchor role for
gold, which most economists and central bankers see as
unrealistic.
 Timed to fuel debate ahead of this week's G20 world economic
summit in Seoul, Zoellick's proposal for a coordinated system of
floating currencies, including China's yuan, is a departure from
20 years of U.S. dogma about leaving exchange rates to markets.
 It comes at a time when Washington and Beijing are at odds
over global economic imbalances, the yuan's exchange rate, and
the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank's renewed decision to
create more money to buy Treasury bonds. 
 This Fed policy, known as quantitative easing or QE2, has
helped depress the dollar, drawing international criticism.
 ""Bob Zoellick not only has got a lot of historical
perspective, but he also understands the global dynamics better
than most,"" said Jim O'Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset
Management. ""With the French about to take over the chair of the
G20, we're going to get a lot more about this sort of thing.""
 Zoellick, a veteran former U.S. policymaker, called for ""a
cooperative monetary system"" that would include the dollar, the
euro, the yen, the pound sterling and the yuan, which would move
""towards internationalisation and an open capital account.
 ""The system should also consider employing gold as an
international reference point of market expectations about
inflation, deflation and future currency values,"" he said.
 
 SDR ROLE FOR YUAN?
 French officials said some of his ideas, aired in an opinion
article in the Financial Times, mirrored initiatives that
President Nicolas Sarkozy aims to promote during France's 12
months in the G20 chair from next week.
 Paris wants to help integrate China, whose currency is not
yet convertible, into the international monetary system
gradually, enabling an orderly appreciation of the yuan to help
balance global trade flows.
 These ideas were at the centre of talks Chinese President Hu
Jintao held in France with Sarkozy last week. Little filtered
out in public, except for Chinese agreement to host a G20
experts' conference next year on reforming the international
monetary system.
 A French official involved in preparations for the G20
presidency said a key Paris aim was to achieve the inclusion of
the yuan in the basket of major currencies used to calculate the
International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Right.
 That would help turn this national accounting tool into a
real reserve currency by encouraging a market for it, including
bond issuance in SDRs, and encouraging central banks to use it
in their reserves, the official said.
 O'Neill of Goldman Sachs said that might be achieved very
soon, since the IMF is due to complete a five-year review of SDR
weightings by Jan. 1 and its board is due to discuss the matter
later this month.
 ""A really smart thing for the IMF to do now would be put the
(yuan) into the SDR today. Then the SDR would suddenly have some
obvious appeal to people in the private sector, and that could
quite rapidly open the door to less dependence on the dollar and
a more shared international monetary system,"" he said in a
telephone interview.
 
 GOLD DOESN'T GLISTEN
 However, there is more scepticism about any idea of a return
to even a modified gold standard.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet,
speaking after a meeting of central bankers from industrialised
and emerging countries in Basel, said they did not discuss the
gold standard.
 ""In my memory, such an idea was mentioned a long time ago by
Jim Baker when he was Secretary of the Treasury in the 1980s,""
Trichet said, adding that he had ""no particular comment"".
Zoellick was a senior Treasury official under Baker.
 One key reason for the collapse of the post-World War Two
Bretton Woods monetary system in 1971, when President Richard
Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard, was that there was
no longer enough gold to back world trade.
 That is even more true in the age of globalisation, when the
volume of international commerce has grown exponentially.
 The gold price has soared and become more volatile than in
previous decades since the start of the financial crisis in 2008
partly as a safe haven for risk-averse investors but chiefly
because interest rates in major economies at are historically
exceptional lows.
 Gilles Moec, senior European economist at Deutsche Bank,
said talk of a return to the gold standard cropped up each time
there was a crisis in the exchange rate system. But there was a
fundamental problem with using the gold price as a proxy for
inflation, when it reflected the supply and demand for an
underlying commodity.
 ""These discussions boil down to one thing: that people are
looking for an anchor. Since the Fed is now getting into some
uncharted territory with its QE2, the need for this kind of
anchor is getting stronger,"" Moec said.
 China is worried for the value of its huge holdings of U.S.
Treasurys, as well as its export competitiveness, while other,
more open emerging economies feared sudden inflows of hot money
into their markets, inflating their exchange rates.
 European nations are worried that they will be stranded with
an uncompetitively high euro exchange rate, and that the Fed's
money-printing may eventually stoke inflation.
 ""Without getting as grand as the Gold Standard, I think
everyone would be more comfortable if ... we had some idea where
things would be in five years from now, if we had some kind of
anchor,"" Moec said.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Monday as
investors fretted anew about budget problems in Ireland and
some of the euro zone's other weaker links.
 Last week's surprisingly strong U.S. jobs data also
prompted investors to buy the dollar, which had slipped to a
9-1/2 month low against the euro after the Federal Reserve said
it would buy $600 billion of Treasuries by mid-2011 to lower
interest rates and reinvigorate a sluggish economy.
 The euro was last down 0.7 percent at $1.3940, and traders
said a break through support around $1.3860, its low so far
this month, could trigger a near-term move toward $1.37. It
also fell 0.8 percent to 113.13 yen.
 ""We're finally seeing the market turn its gaze away from
Fed easing and toward these ongoing problems in peripheral
Europe,"" said Matthew Strauss, senior strategist at RBC Capital
Markets in Toronto.
 ""Even before the Fed meeting, spreads for Ireland, Greece,
Portugal were widening, and now that the Fed has indicated what
it will do, the market is starting to trade on these worries.""
 Current market anxiety was focused mainly on Ireland.
Although the government is funded until early 2011, a local
newspaper report questioned its ability to cut spending next
year, casting doubt on future demand for government debt.
 The cost of protecting Irish government debt against
default rose on Monday, as did equivalent insurance for Spain.
 China said over the weekend it would help Portugal, another
euro zone country with strained public finances, cope with the
crisis but made no promises about buying Portuguese government
bonds. China has promised to buy Greek bonds in the future.
 Weak German industrial output data also hurt the euro,
while a general move away from risk weakened the Australian
dollar, which fell 0.6 percent to $1.0097, off Friday's 28-year
peak of $1.0183. The New Zealand dollar fell 1.2 percent to
$0.7871.
 The U.S. dollar was little changed at 81.15 yen.
 DOLLAR PROBLEMS REMAIN, G20 AHEAD
 The dollar still faces an uphill climb against most major
currencies and will probably remain under pressure against
emerging market ones despite Monday's gains, traders said.
 While recent jobs data as well as reports on manufacturing
and service sector growth were surprisingly strong, analysts
said the economy has yet to show it can sustain such strength.
 ""We don't see a massive sell-off of the euro nor do we
expect a mad sell-off of the dollar. The market is caught
between the impact of the Fed's easing and euro-zone debt
problems,"" said Daragh Maher, deputy head of FX research at
Credit Agricole CIB.
 That will put the focus on other currencies. Among the
majors, Strauss said he likes the Canadian dollar, which has
struggled in the run-up to Fed easing. But he said the currency
stands to gain if the U.S. economy starts to gain traction and
the Bank of Canada is able to raise rates again in 2011.
 The U.S. dollar was last up 0.4 percent at 1.0045 Canadian
dollars.
 Analysts also said traders may be cautious about chasing
the dollar much higher ahead of the Group of 20 nations summit
meeting in Seoul later this week, which may address global
economic imbalances.
 The Fed's decision to pump more money into the U.S. economy
irked developing and some developed countries who fear the
money will stoke inflation outside U.S. borders, where returns
on global investment are higher. Germany's finance minister
called U.S. monetary policy ""clueless.""
 But China appeared to temper its criticism over the
weekend, saying the Fed's policy would help the world economy
by boosting U.S. growth.

(Adds details, quotes, background)
 By David Lawder
 NEW DELHI, Nov. 8 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner on Monday said China is supportive of the Group
of 20's framework for rebalancing the global economy, and he
expects broad consensus on it at a leaders' summit this week.
 Geithner, speaking in the Indian capital during a state
visit with President Barack Obama, earlier met with Indian
Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee in part to discuss the G20
agenda.
 ""I'm very confident that you're going to see very strong
consensus on this basic framework because it meets the basic
tests and it's better than the alternatives,"" Geithner told an
audience of Indian business leaders.
 ""The Chinese are very supportive of it. It has a lot of
benefits to them.""
 The run-up to week's G20 summit has been overshadowed by
disagreements over moves by the U.S. Federal Reserve to print
extra money to buy $600 billion of government bonds over coming
months.
 Critics led by China and Germany argue more quantitative
easing could depress the dollar and cause a potentially
destabilising flow of money into emerging economies. Obama
defended the policy on Monday, suggesting it was growth-friendly
for both the United States and the whole world. [ID:nTOE6A7067]
 Geithner reaffirmed a G20 plan to limit current account
surpluses and deficits does not contain numerical targets, which
he called economically unfeasible. Several countries had
objected to suggestions that such imbalances be limited to
around 4 percent of gross domestic product.
 ""What we have proposed is a framework which incorporates
early warning indicators of large surpluses or deficits which
can then be monitored,"" Geithner said.
 He said limiting current account imbalances was needed to
check excess volatility in financial markets and combat
protectionist pressures, adding that exchange rates were a key
part of the plan.
 
 CHINA STEPS TOWARD CONVERTIBILITY
 The U.S. Treasury chief said China was the early stages of
reforming its currency, a move that was ""overwhelmingly in its
interests"", as well as those of its trading partners.
 Washington blames Beijing for holding down the yuan at a
level it says is unfairly low, giving Chinese exporters a
pricing advantage that hurts U.S. jobs. Geithner has delayed the
delivery of a report on whether China manipulates its currency
until after the G20 summit in Seoul.
 ""It's beginning to start to make the changes that will allow
for broader convertibility over time, but those are in a very
very early stage,"" Geithner said of China.
 Geithner said the United States would work hard to improve
its economic relationship with China.
 A U.S. official in Delhi said that even with the currency
tensions between the United States and China, the two countries'
economic relationship was flourishing and producing a major
increase in U.S. exports to China.
 A key reason for Obama's trip to the region was to show the
importance of exports to the United States' future growth, and
to underscore the need to boost growth around the world.
 The U.S.-India relationship, the official said, does not
carry the same tensions as that with China.
 Geithner on Monday praised India's domestic-driven growth.
With stronger investment in infrastructure and financial
reforms, it was ""perfectly achievable"" for India to sustain an 8
percent to 9 percent annual growth rate for years to come.
 But with strong growth in emerging economies and capital
inflows from slower-growth advanced economies, Geithner said
signs of broader inflation pressure were starting to appear in
emerging economies.
 Geithner said there were signs the U.S. economy was
improving, and it could see stronger-than-expected growth rates
as it emerges from a period of slow growth rates. It could grow
twice as fast as Europe and Japan for a long time to come, he
added.
 On Wednesday, Geithner will travel to Abu Dhabi, to meet
with the crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahayan, to
discuss efforts to cut off financing for terrorism, and then
travel to Singapore for meetings with government officials.
 He will end up in Seoul on Thursday to join Obama for the
G20 summit.

Bretton Woods in paragraph 2)
 By Amanda Cooper and Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The president of the World Bank
has made a bold call on leading global economies to consider
readopting a modified gold standard to guide currency movements,
but the proposal has met with a wall of scepticism.
 Writing in the Financial Times, Robert Zoellick called for a
new system of floating currencies as a successor to the Bretton
Woods fixed-exchange rate regime, which broke down in the early
1970s and involved measuring currency rates against gold.
 Zoellick called for a system that ""is likely to need to
involve the dollar, the euro, the yen, the pound and (yuan) that
moves towards internationalisation and then an open capital
account"".
 The gold price, which is trading near record highs just shy
of $1,400 an ounce, has shown little reaction to Zoellick's
idea, at least so far.
 Following is a Q&A on the likelihood of such a development:
 
 WHAT IS THE GOLD STANDARD?
 The gold standard was effectively an exchange rate mechanism
created in 1944 by the Bretton Woods agreement, ratified by the
U.S. Congress in 1945. It involved setting par values for
currencies in terms of gold and the obligation of member
countries to convert foreign official holdings of their
currencies into gold at those par values.
 The system was set up to help rebuild the international
economy as World War Two still raged. It required each country
to adopt a monetary policy that maintained the exchange rate of
its currency within a fixed value (plus or minus 1 percent in
terms of gold).
 This system remained in place until August 1971, when U.S.
President Richard Nixon removed the dollar peg to gold, which
had been fixed at $35 an ounce.
 In its most basic form, the gold standard involves the
issuance of coinage in gold.
 A more sophisticated system involves paper currency that can
be converted to preset, fixed quantities of gold.
 Another gold standard allows for a specific amount of gold
to be used as standard unit of account for settling terms of
trade and so on.
 
 HOW MIGHT A NEW GOLD STANDARD WORK?
 Zoellick's comments were vague, but analysts say he may be
pushing for a system in which the World Bank's own currency --
Special Drawing Rights or SDRs -- is changed to reflect the
value of the dollar, euro, pound, yen and the yuan and somehow
incorporate gold. 
 The suggestion does not set out, for example, how such a
standard might work when monetary authorities need to make
extraordinary provisions such as quantitative easing or
sterilised currency intervention.
 It also does not make clear how it would prevent monetary
authorities from trading around or outside of any bands that
might be set.
 
 IS IT A REALISTIC PROPOSAL?
 The initial response, given the size of the gold market
alone, is no. Gold is a precious metal by virtue of its limited
supply, and annual gold supply could not keep pace with any
increase in money supply, especially if central banks make use
of quantitative easing to flush their economies with cash.
 ""Unlike the World Bank, we do not believe that a form of the
gold standard will return. Very simply, there is not enough gold
supply in the world for the metal to perform in this role,"" says
UBS precious metals strategist Edel Tully.
 ""As Paul Donavon, from UBS Global Economics points out, any
reserve currency needs a supply that can grow as rapidly as
global trade. Gold supply falls significantly short of this
basic requirement.""
 
 WOULD THERE BE INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR IT?
 Zoellick's suggestion that gold be used as an international
reference point of market expectations for price pressures and
future currency values comes in the middle of a virtual
international currency war.
 The U.S. dollar has fallen broadly this year, having lost
nearly 13 percent against a basket of major currencies in the
past five months. That has triggered an outcry from many key
emerging economies, which have seen the competitiveness of their
exports dwindle as well as a pick-up in so-called ""hot money""
inflows from speculative investors.
 The United States continues to exert pressure on China to
allow its yuan currency to appreciate and wipe out some of the
competitive edge of the world's biggest exporter, and members of
the G20 have rejected placing limits on currency and trade
surpluses as a means of rebalancing the global economy.
 With a distinct lack of accord over how to correct the
surpluses of the emerging world and the deficits of the
developed one, the chances of a deal on adopting a gold
standard, in any form, appear limited.
 ""It is conceivable for greater cooperation in the currency
region, but gold may not necessarily be at the heart of any
realignment of the currency system,"" says Daragh Maher, deputy
head of global foreign exchange research at Credit Agricole CIB.
 ""More cooperation, such as a (U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy) Geithner-like approach, but not specific target levels
(for current account imbalances) but something that would
involve not tolerating imbalances domestically may be something
to be considered,"" he says.
 With the Federal Reserve set to pump over half a trillion
dollars into the U.S. economy, the rise in money supply and
subsequent rise in inflation would make it difficult to hold
enough gold.
 Hans Redeker, global head of foreign exchange strategy at
BNP Paribas, says the supply of money would depend on the amount
of gold one holds. So an increase in money supply would have
nothing to do with economic circumstances. 
 ""It's a step in the right direction, but it is not going to
fly. People are desperately seeking ways to stem the wave of
liquidity (from U.S. monetary easing), but bringing back the
gold standard is not realistic,"" he says.
 Redeker adds that throwing gold into the global currency mix
would not help stem excess liquidity by the United States, which
is fuelling inflation especially in China and emerging Asia.

 By Patricia Zengerle and Krittivas Mukherjee
 NEW DELHI, Nov 8 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama
defended the Federal Reserve's policy of printing dollars on
Monday after China and Russia stepped up criticism ahead of this
week's Group of 20 meeting.
 The G20 summit has been pitched as a chance for leaders of
the countries that account for 85 percent of world output to
prevent a currency row escalating into a rush to protectionism
that could imperil the global recovery.
 But there is little sign of consensus.
 The summit has been overshadowed by disagreements over the
U.S. Federal Reserve's quantitative easing (QE) policy under
which it will print money to buy $600 billion of government
bonds, a move that could depress the dollar and cause a
potentially destabilising flow of money into emerging economies.
 ""I will say that the Fed's mandate, my mandate, is to grow
our economy. And that's not just good for the United States,
that's good for the world as a whole,"" Obama said during a trip
to India.
 ""And the worst thing that could happen to the world economy,
not just ours, is if we end up being stuck with no growth or
very limited growth,"" he said.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said all
participants at a meeting of the world's central bankers in
Basel, Switzerland had insisted they were not pursuing weak
currency policies.
 ""We're attached to avoiding excessive volatility. It's very
counterproductive for global growth and global stability,"" he
told a news conference.
 
 CHINA, RUSSIA ATTACK FED MOVE
 Washington has frequently criticised China, saying it
deliberately undervalues its currency to boost exports.
 China says the United States, via the Fed, is engaged in the
same thing that it stands accused of, and some emerging nations
have already acted to curb their currencies' rise.
 Resentment abroad stems from worry that Fed pump-priming
will hasten the U.S. dollar's slide and cause their currencies
to shoot up in value, setting the stage for asset bubbles and
making a future burst of inflation more likely.
 ""As a major reserve currency issuer, for the United States
to launch a second round of quantitative easing at this time, we
feel that it did not recognise its responsibility to stabilise
global markets and did not think about the impact of excessive
liquidity on emerging markets,"" Chinese Finance Vice Minister
Zhu Guangyao said on Monday.
 The Fed's quantitative easing policy was unveiled last week
to jeers from emerging market powerhouses from Latin America to
Asia. Russia renewed its assault on Monday.
 ""Russia's president will insist .... that such actions are
taken with preliminary consultations with other members of the
global economy,"" said Arkady Dvorkovich, a Russian official who
is preparing the country's position in Seoul.
 Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Hirohide Yamaguchi said on
Monday that it too was ready to boost its asset-buying scheme if
it saw clear signs of a downturn. Worth 5 trillion yen ($62
billion), it is so far just a tenth the size of the Fed's.
 
 U.S. DROPS KEY DEMAND
 India is Obama's first stop in a 10-day trip to Asia that
will include Indonesia and Japan.
 He will arrive in Seoul for the Nov. 11-12 summit weakened
by a crushing congressional election defeat for his Democratic
Party and under fire from all sides. Germany described U.S.
economic policy as ""clueless"" last week.
 The U.S. has already all but dropped its centrepiece
proposal for the G20 -- a measure that would cap current account
balances at 4 percent of gross domestic product, something
economists said was clearly aimed at China.
 At the weekend, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner
backed away from the numerical target that had been rejected by
China, Germany, Japan and others in a sign that global financial
power had slipped from U.S. hands.
 On Monday, he was putting on a brave face, saying China was
supportive of the G20's framework for rebalancing the global
economy, and that he expected broad consensus on it at the
summit.
 The risk of a negative outcome in Seoul appears to be
increasing, or at the very least, an agreement that merely
papers over the huge gaps and allows countries to pursue their
own economic policies whether it be intervening in currency
markets like South Korea and Japan or printing dollars.
 ""Judging by the critical response of emerging market
governments to QE, the likelihood of a ceasefire in the currency
war is slim,"" RBC Capital markets said in a report published on
Monday.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on Monday on
renewed concerns about euro zone peripheral debt, while
investors trimmed short dollar positions built up before the
U.S. Federal Reserve eased monetary policy last week.
 Solid U.S. jobs data on Friday [ID:nN04265378] also helped
the dollar recover as it assuaged concerns the Fed may opt for
more quantitative easing than it announced on Wednesday and led
many to conclude that bad news was fully priced into the dollar.
 With the Fed's decision to launch more QE out of the way,
euro zone debt worries have reappeared on traders' radars, while
weak German industrial output data [ID:nBZN8ME63Q] triggered
more euro selling.
 Concerns about Ireland's ability to fund its budget caused
the cost of protecting government debt against default in
Ireland to rise, while the equivalent debt insurance for Spain
also rose. [GVD/EUR]
 Analysts were not all convinced the euro's pullback against
the dollar would be too deep, however, with Fed QE remaining a
negative for the dollar. Although $1.40 may now provide stiff
resistance, support was seen at the November low of $1.3860.
 ""We've had a bit of a post-QE hangover and a refocusing on
strains in the euro zone,"" said Kit Juckes, currency strategist
at Societe Generale.
 ""This is a correction and not more. The dollar and the euro
have different problems, but they both have problems.""
 The euro  was down 0.8 percent against the dollar at
$1.3919, having hit a low of $1.3892, according to Reuters data,
its lowest in a week. Traders reported stop loss orders on a
break of $1.3880. 
 Below the $1.3860 November low, more support was seen at
$1.3835, the 76.4 percent retracement of the Oct. 20 to Nov. 4
rally to a 10-month high of $1.4283. Some saw a fall towards
$1.3750, just below the late October low of $1.3756.
 The latest positioning data, taken just before the Fed
decision, showed speculators had increased dollar short
positions in anticipation of more Fed easing. [IMM/FX]
 ""We don't see a massive sell-off of the euro nor do we
expect a mad sell-off of the dollar. The market is caught
between the impact of the Fed's QE and euro zone debt problems,""
said Daragh Maher, deputy head of FX research at Credit Agricole
CIB.

 Analysts also said traders may be cautious about chasing the
dollar much higher ahead of the Group of 20 summit meeting in

 ""Now that QE by the Fed has become a fact, the market is

at Unicredit in Milan.
 The euro fell 1.1 percent against the yen  to hit
the day's low of 112.65 yen, according to Reuters data. It also
fell 0.6 percent against the pound to 86.19 pence .
 The dollar fell 0.2 percent against the yen to 81.06 yen
 but remained above its 15-year low of 80.21 yen plumbed
last week as the U.S. currency gained broadly.
 Versus a currency basket, the dollar <.DXY> was up 0.7
percent at 77.102. The higher-yielding Aussie dollar  was
down 0.5 percent at $1.0110, off Friday's 28-year peak of

 * Opinion backs up criticism of plans from some EU states
 * Governments due to discuss legal opinion this week
 
 BRUSSELS, Nov 8 (Reuters) - EU legal experts ""seriously
doubt"" that plans to let European Union member states decide for
themselves to grow or ban genetically modified (GM) crops are in
line with global trade rules, officials said on Monday.
 The European Commission made legal proposals in July to let
governments to make their own decisions on the controversial
crops, in a bid to break a longstanding EU deadlock on new GM
product approvals.
 But a new opinion from the EU Council of Ministers' legal
service could deal a fatal blow to the plans, after several EU
governments already expressed fears that the draft law risks
breaching World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.
 ""Everything to do with WTO compatibility in the legal
opinion is not positive at all,"" one EU source told Reuters.
 A key concern raised by the legal experts is how governments
would justify a cultivation ban after the Commission had ruled
out environmental or health grounds for prohibitions.
 ""Economic arguments cannot be relied upon ... so the obvious
remaining candidate would therefore be ethical reasons,"" the
opinion stated, according to an EU official.
 But ethical arguments are unlikely to be accepted by the WTO
or the European courts as grounds for a ban, as livestock
farmers in most EU countries already feed animals with imported
GM products, thus undermining the argument, the opinion added.
 As a result, national cultivation bans based on ethical
criteria risk being either rejected by the European Courts or
challenged in the WTO, the experts concluded.
 The legal opinion will be presented to EU government experts
in Brussels on Thursday, in a meeting that could confirm
majority opposition to the plans among the bloc's 27 member
states.
 France, Italy and Spain have all expressed doubts over the
Commission's plans and want decisions on GM cultivation to
continue to be taken collectively at EU level.

rates, World Bank president Robert Zoellick said on Monday in a
surprise proposal before a potentially acrimonious G20 summit.
 Writing in the Financial Times, Zoellick called for a new
system of floating currencies as a successor to the Bretton
Woods fixed-exchange rate regime, which broke down in the early
1970s and involved measuring currency rates against gold.
 The former U.S. trade representative, who served in several
Republican administrations, said the new system ""is likely to
need to involve the dollar, the euro, the yen, the pound and (a
Chinese yuan) that moves towards internationalisation and then
an open capital account.
 ""The system should also consider employing gold as an
international reference point of market expectations about
inflation, deflation and future currency values,"" he added.
 Zoellick did not spell out in detail how this system might
work, but said it would help to rebuild the confidence of
financial markets and the general public in the global monetary
system after the financial crisis.
 However, policymakers appeared cool to the idea of returning
to a gold standard, while many analysts said they doubted it
would be implemented given practical difficulties.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said
central bankers from around the world did not discuss returning
to a gold standard at a meeting of the Bank for International
Settlements in Switzerland on Monday.
 ""In my memory such an idea was mentioned a long time ago by
Jim Baker when he was a (U.S.) Secretary of Treasury in the
1980s. I have no particular comment,"" Trichet told a news
conference.
 A German government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Zoellick was correct in worrying that currency
values were becoming too vulnerable to the whims of governments,
but added that the idea of a new gold standard was impractical.
 ""The diagnosis that Zoellick is making is correct: that
monetary policy is becoming overly politicised,"" the official
said. ""The system, as it is, is not functioning well.""
 But he added that it would not be practical to use modern
monetary policy tools in a system that was ""based on a commodity
whose availability is dictated by natural conditions"".
 Analysts said it would be very difficult to introduce any
new gold standard partly because the global supply of gold was
limited and might not be able to keep pace with the expansion of
global trade and money supply.
 ""Going forward, that would be something that we could look
towards, but it's not going to happen within a short period of
time,"" said Ong Yi Ling at Phillip Futures in Singapore.
 The price of gold barely moved in response to Zoellick's
proposal. It briefly hit a record high of $1,398.35 an ounce
early on Monday on concern about a weakening trend for the
dollar, after the U.S. Federal Reserve last week decided to
resume buying Treasury bonds to inflate its money supply.
 
 SUMMIT ACRIMONY?
 That policy has fed acrimony among leading economies in the
Group of 20 in the run-up to their summit in Seoul on Thursday
and Friday.
 China and Germany, major exporting nations, have both
criticised the Fed's quantitative easing -- effectively printing
money -- which is weakening the dollar.
 Investors are pumping dollars into emerging markets in
search of higher yields, and the potentially destabilising
impact of this, along with big current account deficits and
surpluses as well as China's reluctance to let the yuan
appreciate faster, are set to dominate the G20 debate.
 France, which takes over the G20 chair after this week's
summit, says it plans to work on a new international monetary
system to bring greater currency stability.
 Beijing's central bank chief has suggested an alternative
monetary system based on using the International Monetary Fund's
Special Drawing Rights, a notional unit of value based on a
basket of major currencies, instead of the dollar as the sole
global reserve currency.
 Zoellick was a senior official in the U.S. Treasury at the
time of the 1985 Plaza and 1987 Louvre Accords on rebalancing
currencies among major industrialised nations. He noted that
that phase of currency coordination helped launch the Uruguay
Round of world trade liberalisation negotiations.
 While his opinion article in the Financial Times did not
represent either U.S. or World Bank policy, it may reflect a
greater openness in Washington than in the last two decades to
some form of international currency cooperation.
 ""The dollar is losing its relevance especially with the
emergence of Asia economies, so a more neutral benchmark may be
required. Gold, amid all the recent uncertainty, is proving its
worth,"" said ANZ's senior commodity analyst Mark Pervan.
 Zoellick said a new monetary system would take time to
develop and should be part of a package approach including
possible changes in IMF rules to review capital as well as
current account policies, and linking IMF monetary assessments
to World Trade Organisation obligations.

599,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2010 06:28AM ET</span>",Industry groups lobby G20 on rare earth supply," * Global business urges G20 commitment to rare earth supply
 * Open letter warns of trade disputes following supply cuts
 * G20 leaders must commit to end export quotas and taxes
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Nov 8 (Reuters) - G20 leaders must address
bottlenecks in the global supply of rare earth elements or risk
blockages in economic growth and the fight against climate
change, industry groups from around the world said on Monday.
 ""Without adequate supply to open access to such elements,
global efforts to address climate change, promote innovation,
and advance global growth will be significantly hindered,"" the
industry groups said in an open letter ahead of this week's G20
summit in Seoul, South Korea.
 The letter was signed by representatives of automakers,
electronics manufacturers and energy producers, among other
sectors, from industrialised and developing countries.
 Uncertainty over access to rare earths -- elements used in
high-tech sectors from carmaking and electronics to Internet
fibre optics and renewable energy -- has caused alarm across the
world following a decision by China to curb exports in 2011.
 China controls about 97 percent of global rare earth
production, but says it wants to cut exports for environmental
reasons. New mining projects in the United States, Canada and
Australia will take several years to reach production.
 ""G20 leaders should work together to find pragmatic and
sustainable short-term solutions for a stable and secure rare
earth supply,"" said the letter, signed by 37 associations from
the United States, the European Union, Brazil, Japan, South
Korea and India.
 The groups warned of acute trade tensions between the
world's major economies resulting from supply cuts.
 The EU, United States and Mexico are currently challenging
Chinese export restrictions on raw materials, and EU officials
say they are monitoring the situation while deciding whether to
take more legal action against Beijing.
 ""Further trade disputes cannot be in the interest of all G20
nations,"" the letter said.
 G20 leaders should commit themselves to refraining from
export taxes or quotas, renouncing interference in the
commercial sale of rare earths, collaborating to diversify rare
earth mining and improving rare earth recycling, the groups
said.
 Among the letter's signatories were the Alliance of
Automobile Manufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute,
BusinessEurope, the Japan Electronics and Information Technology
Industries Association, the Federation of Korean Industries and
the Brazil-U.S. Business Council.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Gold hit a new high on Monday,
stoked by rising inflation expectations following the Federal
Reserve's return to asset buying, and the dollar gained in a
hang-over from last week's relatively upbeat U.S. jobs data.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were down
0.2 percent after last week hitting levels last reached prior to
the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Emerging market stocks
<.MSCIEF> were flat.
 Wall Street also looked set to open lower.
 Investors were digesting an idea floated in The Financial
Times by World Bank President Robert Zoellick that leading
economies should consider readopting a modified global gold
standard to guide currency movements. [ID:nSGE6A702V]
 Gold  [GOL/] briefly powered to a record above $1,398
an ounce in Asia, mainly driven by concerns that the Fed's
renewed quantitative easing programme will stoke underlying
inflation. The metal later was down about a quarter of a
percent.
 Ong Yi Ling, analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore, said
gold prices had barely reacted to Zoellick's comments. ""Going
forward that would be something that we could look towards, but
it's not going to happen within a short period of time.""
 The dollar is also widely seen weakening as a result of the
$600 'QE2' billion programme, which essentially entails printing
more money. Gold tends to rise when the dollar is weak.
 On Monday, however, the U.S. currency was up 0.6 percent
against a basket of major competitors <.DXY>, recouping recent
losses following better than expected U.S jobs data on Friday.
 ""As we've had a good run on positive U.S. data, the market
is buying back an oversold dollar,"" said Keiji Matsumoto,
strategist at Nikko Cordial Securities.
 The euro was notably weak, down 0.9 percent at $1.3920
.
 Some of the euro's fall against the dollar reflected renewed
concern about some of the single currency bloc's peripheral
economies.
 Newspaper reports raising fresh doubts about Ireland's
ability to fund itself internationally have weighed on the euro
and caused spreads between Irish and German government bond
yields to widen.
 ""Now that QE by the Fed has become a fact, the market is
paying attention to other factors that were overshadowed ahead
of the Fed meeting,"" said Roberto Mialich, currency strategist
at Unicredit in Milan.
 
 STOCKS MIXED
 European shares were slightly lower as investors cashed in
on six-month high prices reached on Friday.
 The Athens bourse's banking index <.FTATBNK> jumped 3.4
percent, however, after results of local elections ruled out a
snap general election in the economically strapped euro zone
country.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
was down 0.1 percent.
 ""Some degree of profit-taking doesn't come as a surprise
after a gain of about 15 percent since late August. The market
might lack a little bit of direction for the first day or two of
the week,"" said Keith Bowman, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
 Investors were more bullish in Japan, taking the Nikkei
average <.N225> up 1.1 percent to a three-month closing high.

 * To be matched by private funding
 * Priority areas for research are solar and biofuels
(adds financial details from statement)
 By Patricia Zengerle and Alister Bull
 NEW DELHI, Nov 8 (Reuters) - India and the United States
have agreed to cooperate on energy projects, including shale
gas and clean energy, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and
U.S. President Barack Obama told a press conference on Monday.
 The two countries will set up a research and development
centre for clean energy in India and will provide annual
funding of $5 million each for five years, with matching
investment from the private sector, they said in a joint
statement.
 ""We agreed to deepen our co-operation in pursuit of clean
energy technologies, including the creation of a new clean
energy research centre here in India, and continuing our joint
research into solar, biofuels, shale gas and building
efficiency,"" Obama said.
 The statement said initial priority areas for the research
centre would be ""solar energy, second-generation biofuels and
building efficiency."" The agreement initially runs for 10
years.
 India, which has one of the world's lowest power
consumption rates per capita, has set a power generation target
of 62,000 megawatts by March 2012. It now has around 165
gigawatts of installed generation capacity.
 Around two-thirds of the country's electricity is generated
from thermal power now, using coal, gas and liquid fuel.
 India is looking at alternative sources of energy to plug
gaps in its supply and demand for electricity which lead to
frequent power cuts.
 Nuclear and hydro electricity generation account for less
than a quarter of India's total output currently.
 Its crude oil needs are met largely through imports, with
make up around four-fifths, as near double-digit economic
growth gobbles up energy. So far, its own oil exploration has
provided insufficient flows.
 The agreement on shale gas calls for the United States to
carry out studies on resources and for cooperation on
identifying areas with shale gas potential. Indian personnel
will be trained in assessing resources.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on Monday on
renewed concerns about euro zone peripheral debt while Friday's
solid U.S. jobs data supported the dollar.
 With the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to launch more
quantitative easing out of the way, euro zone debt problems
seemed to have resurfaced on traders' radars.
 ""Now that QE by the Fed has become a fact, the market is
paying attention to other factors that were overshadowed ahead
of the Fed meeting,"" said Roberto Mialich, currency strategist
at Unicredit in Milan.
 ""Also, stronger-than-expected U.S. payrolls sparked more

consolidation of the euro between $1.38 and $1.40 during the
week.""
 He said traders may be cautious about chasing the dollar too
high ahead of the Group of 20 summit meeting in Seoul later this
weekend, which may address imbalances.
 By 0906 GMT, the euro had fallen 0.8 percent to $1.3921.
It earlier hit a session low of $1.3906 after falling through
support of $1.3920, the 61.8 percent retracement of its Oct. 20
to Nov. 4 rally to a 10-month high of $1.4283.
 More support was seen at $1.3835, the 76.4 percent
retracement, with some eyeing a fall toward $1.3750, the
currency having hit a late October low of $1.3756.
 ""Tensions have already resurfaced significantly with
increasingly unsustainable market funding costs for Ireland and
Portugal,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 The 10-year Irish bond yield spread over benchmark German
debt widened on Monday, while investors eyed a government bond
auction by Portugal this week.
 The euro fell 1.1 percent against the yen to hit the day's
low of 112.67 yen, according to Reuters data, taking it through
reported stop-loss orders at 112.70/80 which the market had been
 targeting, traders said. It also fell almost 0.5 percent
against the pound to 86.26 pence.
 Euro/yen selling weighed on other currencies against the
yen.
 The dollar fell 0.1 percent against the yen at 81.14 yen
but remained above its 15-year low of 80.21 yen plumbed last
week as the U.S. currency gained broadly.
 But traders said they expected the dollar's upside to be
limited as offers were lined up around 82 yen.
 Japanese finance ministry data on Monday showed Tokyo
stepped into the currency market to sell yen for dollars only
once in September, on Sept. 15.
 The dollar index, a measure of its performance against a
basket of currencies, rose 0.6 percent to 76.990 as the
greenback gained after U.S. jobs data blew past expectations on
Friday.
 The Australian dollar fell 0.5 percent to $1.0103, off a
28-year peak of $1.0183 scaled on Friday. The New Zealand dollar
fell more than 1 percent to a low of $0.7868.

 By Gleb Bryanski
 MOSCOW, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Russia sided with China ahead of
the Group of 20 summit, saying on Monday the United States
should consult other countries before pumping cash into its
economy, but stopped short of calling the policy a mistake.
 President Dmitry Medvedev will take part in the summit,
where conflict is brewing over the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest
allocation of $600 billion to buy Treasury bonds -- money that
investors are likely to redirect into emerging markets in search
of higher returns, potentially fuelling new asset bubbles. 
 ""Russia's President (Dmitry Medvedev) will insist .... that
such actions are taken with preliminary consultations with other
members of (the Group of 20 countries),"" said Russian G20
negotiator Arkady Dvorkovich. 
 China has been particularly vocal in criticism of the
policy, which U.S. President Barack Obama defended on Monday
during a trip to India, saying the Fed's mandate to grow the
U.S. economy was good for the world as a whole. 
 Dvorkovich said that the Fed's policy was an internal matter
but added that previous decisions by the G20 require
consultations on such issues. He said the Fed's move may even
benefit Russia because its current capital inflows were too
small. 
 ""Capital inflow for Russia now is a plus. It may not be a
plus for other emerging countries such as Brazil or China where
economies are overheated. Our economy is not overheated,""
Dvorkovich said. 
 
 NO LESS DANGEROUS
 Dvorkovich also said that Russia does not support the idea
of establishing numerical target limits for current account
balances, proposed by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner
when the G20 finance ministers met last month. 
 ""We're against such a simplified approach; it can create
other imbalances, no less dangerous,"" Dvorkovich told a news
conference. ""A system of criteria is possible, one criterion
cannot work.""
 Dvorkovich said Russia was not ""fully satisfied"" with the
reform of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed by G20
finance ministers, suggesting that emerging economies will push
for more voting rights in the near future. 
 Dvorkovich said the results of U.S. congressional elections
in which Democrats suffered heavy losses will not slow down the
""reset"" policy between the two countries. Medvedev is due to
meet U.S. President Barack Obama this week. 
 Dvorkovich said the United States and other developed
nations should open up their economies to investment from
developing countries. He added that such investment can offset
""hot"" money flows resulting from the Fed's policy.
""Now everyone is scared that this $600 billion will flow
into emerging markets but a counterflow can have a stabilising
effect,"" Dvorkovich said. ""Everyone wants to invest in the U.S.
economy, it is not so bad.""

 * Beijing says no plans now for bilateral meeting
 * APEC seeks free trade region, balanced growth
 By Linda Sieg and Chris Buckley
 YOKOHAMA, Japan, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Third time lucky, or three
strikes and you're out?
 On Monday, Japanese Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara said he
hoped Prime Minister Naoto Kan could meet Chinese President Hu
Jintao for talks at an Asia-Pacific summit, where leaders are to
lay out a path to free trade in the fast-growing region.
 It will be the third time in recent weeks that Kan has sought
a bilateral meeting with a Chinese leader. On the previous two
occasions, he had to settle for brief informal chats, a sign of
how deeply a territorial row has bruised ties between Asia's two
biggest economies.
 Leaders of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum will gather on Nov. 13-14 in Yokohama, south of
Tokyo to discuss how to free up trade and achieve balanced growth
in a region accounting for more than half of global economic
output.
 ""I hope that the leaders (of Japan and China) will have a
frank exchange of views from a broad perspective, despite small
differences, so as to nurture strategic, mutually beneficial
relations,"" Maehara told parliament in Tokyo.
 But China is still playing hard-to-get.
 In Beijing, Assistant Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin told a
news conference: ""There are no plans for a bilateral visit (when
Hu is in Japan). As to whether there is a chance of a bilateral
meeting (during APEC), I do not have the agenda yet.""
 Sino-Japanese ties have chilled since September when Japan
detained a Chinese trawler captain whose boat collided with
Japanese coast guard ships near a chain of disputed islands that
are close to vast potential oil and gas reserves.
 The diplomatic strains risk spilling over into business ties
between Asia's dominant economies, which together account for
about 17 percent of the world's economic output. China is edging
past Japan as Asia's biggest economy, and is Japan's biggest
trading partner with bilateral trade worth $270 billion in 2009.
 Both sides appear to be working towards a meeting this time
that would help ease the strains weighing on trade and political
ties, said Liu Jiangyong, a professor at Tsinghua University in
Beijing who specialises in ties with Japan.
 MUTUAL MISTRUST
 The sea dispute returned to the headlines on Friday after a
video, appearing to show the Chinese trawler colliding with the
Japanese vessels, was leaked to the Internet.
 Kan met Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao for a brief, informal chat
at an Asian summit in Hanoi in late October aiming to defuse the
territorial tensions, after expectations of a formal meeting were
dashed with China blaming Japan for ""damaging the atmosphere"".
 That meeting followed another short conversation in Brussels
on the sidelines of a Asia-Europe summit in Brussels.
 China has blamed Japan for scuppering the talks, although
analysts in Tokyo say Beijing is worried that any appearance of
coddling Japan would inflame its own citizens.
 ""If they have absorbed the lessons of the recent
multi-lateral meetings, then Japan won't use this one as a venue
to air bilateral disputes with China,"" said Liu, the professor.
 ""If they do, then again they will have to deal with an
unhappy guest.""
 Sino-Japanese ties have long been plagued by China's bitter
memories of Tokyo's wartime aggression and by regional rivalry.
 Public opinion in both countries reflects deep mutual
mistrust, limiting the ability of policy-makers to compromise.
 A recent survey by Japan's Yomiuri newspaper and China's
Xinhua news agency found 87 percent of Japanese said China could
not be trusted. In China, 79 percent said the same of Japan.
 Voter dissatisfaction with Kan's handling of the dispute --
he took office in June as Japan's fifth premier in three years --
has also helped to erode support for his government.
 Only 34 percent of voters backed his government, down from 53
percent in early October. A whopping 91 percent said they felt
anxiety about Kan's security and foreign policies, and 82 percent
took a negative view of his handling of the territorial feud.
 Kan, already struggling with a divided parliament and weak
economy, has come under heavy fire at home for seeming to cave
into Beijing's demands to free the Chinese skipper whose fishing
boat collided with two Japanese patrol boats, especially after a
video of the incident was leaked to the Internet on Friday.

 BEIJING, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The world must get better at
managing capital flows and imbalances, but this is not a
challenge that will be resolved overnight, British finance
minister George Osborne told Reuters on Monday.
 ""There's the debate about global imbalances and about the
relationship between deficit and surplus economies. That is a
huge economic challenge,"" Osborne said in an interview in Beijing
ahead of this week's G20 summit in South Korea.
 ""Anyone who thinks that can simply be solved by a sentence in
a communique, I think simply doesn't understand that this has
always been a challenge in managing the global economy,"" he
added.
 ""We have to get better as a world at managing capital flows
and managing imbalances,"" Osborne said. ""There's a growing
understanding that the root cause of our problems are these
imbalances and we need to address them.""
 Capital inflows into developing countries have been
increasingly strong. Flows into emerging market funds reached
$46.4 billion in the year to the fourth week of October compared
with $9.4 billion for all of 2009, according to Global fund
tracker EPFR.
 That has prompted some emerging economies to implement
capital controls.
 Among other measures taken around the world, Thailand has
imposed a 15 percent withholding tax on interest and capital
gains earned by foreign investors on Thai bonds, and South Korea
has asked banks not to lend in foreign currencies.
 ""We shouldn't be against capital inflows. There is a
particular challenge in very rapid capital inflows -- hot money,
so-called, that can lead to asset bubbles. That's what we've got
to manage,"" Osborne said.
 China has come under pressure, particularly in the United
States, to let its yuan currency appreciate faster.
 China has let the yuan  gain about 2.5 percent against
the dollar since it was depegged on June 19. [ID:nTOE69E04V]
 A stronger yuan is seen as a key component of China's reforms
to cut its trade surplus and contribute to the rebalancing of the
global economy. Critics say that an undervalued yuan gives
Chinese exporters an unfair advantage.
 But weak demand in developed economies including the U.S. and
Europe, where governments have a heavy debt burden, could put a
large strain on China's exports for some time to come.
 ""The pace of change in China is fast but nevertheless the
developments that we want to see are developments that will take
place over months and years. They don't need to happen by the end
of the week,"" Osborne said.
 ""There's been some appreciation and I think there is an
understanding in China as well as the rest of the world that this
is one part of the currency issue. It's one part of a broader
picture of imbalance,"" he added.
 ""It's been a good thing that we're not just focusing on
currencies. We're focusing on a broader range of things which
reflect imbalances in the world and need to be resolved, but
these things aren't going to happen overnight.""

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Monday as an
unwinding of dollar short positions that began with solid U.S.
jobs data gathered pace, while renewed concern over euro zone
peripheral debt hurt the euro.
 With the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to launch more
quantitative easing out of the way, euro zone debt problems
seemed to have reappeared on traders' radars.
 On Friday, the 10-year Irish bond yield spread over
benchmark German debt hit record highs, while the 10-year
Spanish/German spread rose to its highest level since mid-July.
 ""Now that QE by the Fed has become a fact, the market is
paying attention to other factors that were overshadowed ahead
of the Fed meeting,"" said Roberto Mialich, currency strategist
at Unicredit in Milan.
 ""Also, stronger-than-expected U.S. payrolls sparked more
position adjustments and profit-taking on the euro. I see a
consolidation of the euro between $1.38 and $1.40 during the
week,"" he said, adding traders may be cautious about chasing the
dollar too high ahead of the Group of 20 summit meeting in Seoul
this weekend, which may address imbalances.
 By 0828 GMT, the euro dropped 0.5 percent to $1.3953, after
triggering stops as it fell through $1.4010 and $1.3990, its low
of last Wednesday when the Fed said it would increase its asset
purchases.
 There was support at the day's low of $1.3920, the 61.8
percent retracement of its Oct. 20 to Nov. 4 rally to a 10-month
high of $1.4283, and more at $1.3835, the 76.4 percent
retracement. Some said the euro could fall towards $1.3750,
having hit a late October low of $1.3756.
 The dollar index, a measure of its performance against a
basket of currencies, rose 0.4 percent to 76.889, as the
greenback gained after U.S. jobs data blew past expectations on
Friday.
 Euro/yen selling out of Tokyo was also said to have helped
send the single currency lower, which in turn weighed on other
currencies against the yen.
 The dollar was flat against the yen at 81.20 yen and a full
yen above its 15-year low of 80.21 yen plumbed last week.
 Japanese finance ministry data on Monday showed Tokyo
stepped into the currency market to sell yen for dollars only
once on Sept. 15.
 ""I think dollar/yen will eventually rise given the backdrop
of a broad rebound in the dollar, though I suspect there will be
very heavy offers around 82 yen,"" said a trader at a Japanese
brokerage house.
 The Australian dollar fell 0.3 percent to $1.0128, off a
28-year peak of $1.0183 scaled on Friday. The New Zealand dollar
fell more than 1 percent to a low of $0.7868.

 * Asia ex-Japan shares retreat from 2-1/2-year highs
 By Koh Gui Qing;
 SYDNEY, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Gold hit a fresh record and
Japanese shares struck three-month highs on Monday as low
interest rates in advanced economies drove investors to seek
higher returns and protection against inflation.
 The dollar rose sharply as traders continued to unwind
short positions after stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs data on
Friday, and as worries about debt problems in Ireland and other
parts of the euro zone weighed on the euro.
 Major European shares eased 0.1 percent in early trade as
investors took profits on last week's strong rally, which had
pushed some markets into ""overbought"" territory.
 ""A liquidity bubble is emerging in global markets,"" said
Kenichi Hirano, operating officer at Tachibana Securities.
""Investors increasingly believe Japanese stocks, which have
lagged behind, will also reverse course.""
 Super-loose monetary policy and tepid economic growth in
most of the developed world has fuelled the hunt for better
yields. Friday's strong U.S. jobs report further encouraged the
drive into riskier assets, although the effect was muted in the
currency market by the bounce in the U.S. dollar.
 The U.S. dollar index against a basket of major currencies
rose 0.4 percent, extending its rebound from an 11-month low
hit last week, restraining the yen from 15-year peaks and
offering some respite to Japanese exporters.
 Japan's Nikkei average rose 1.1 percent to its highest
level since late July, and was the day's best performer in
Asia.
 The broader MSCI Asia ex-Japan index eased 0.1 percent but
was still a whisker from Friday's 2-1/2-year highs.
 Shanghai stocks struck seven-month peaks and the Indonesian
bourse rose to yet another record high as foreign funds
continued to flood into fast growing emerging markets, spurred
by expectations that U.S. interest rates would stay near zero
for a long time.
 Since the start of 2009, Indonesian shares have leapt 172
percent, dwarfing a mere 10 percent gain in the Nikkei over the
same period.
 INFLATION FEARS PUSH GOLD TO NEW HIGH
 Firm commodity prices led resource stocks higher across the
region, though the dollar's rebound pared gains in energy and
metals prices on Monday.
 In Japan, Sumitomo Metal Mining Co climbed 2.3 percent and
Mitsui Mining and Smelting gained 2.7 percent. Australia's Rio
Tinto rose 0.2 percent.
 Gold a traditional hedge against inflation, briefly powered
to a record above $1,398 an ounce on concerns that fresh policy
easing unveiled by the U.S. Federal Reserve last week would
inevitably fuel inflationary pressures that may prove hard to
snuff out.
 Crude oil held near two-year highs and silver hit 30-year
peaks.
 A TURN IN EURO?
 Even though the currency market seemed to shy from risk on
Monday after a drop in the euro below $1.40 dragged other
higher-yielding currencies down with it, some investors were
not sure if selling in the euro would last.
 In late trade, the euro was down at $1.3950, testing
support at $1.3920, the 61.8 percent retracement of its Oct. 20
to Nov. 4 rally to a 10-month highs.
 On one hand, resurging worries about debt problems in
Europe were weighing on the common currency once more. The
ten-year Irish bond yield spread over benchmark German debt hit
record highs on Friday.
 But many traders also conceded it was hard to be bullish on
the dollar given record low U.S. rates and its sluggish
economy.
 ""I think the euro could fall to around $1.37, though I
think its trading range since October will hold,"" said Keiji
Matsumoto, a strategist at Nikko Cordial Securities.

 BERLIN, Nov 8 (Reuters) - German exports grew twice as fast
as expected in September and the trade surplus to its widest in
nearly two years, data showed on Monday, pointing to solid
economic growth in the third quarter.
 Adjusted for seasonal swings, exports rose by 3.0 percent on
the month and imports fell by 1.5 percent, the figures from the
Federal Statistics Office showed.
 A Reuters poll had forecast exports would rise by 1.5
percent, with imports seen gaining 0.6 percent. 
 ""This clear rise is good news,"" said UniCredit economist
Alexander Koch, adding that foreign trade should make a positive
contribution to economic growth in the third quarter.
 ""We're expecting a good result that should be broad-based,
with GDP rising by 0.7 percent, because the retail figures and
domestic investment are pointing upwards,"" he said.
 The German economy, Europe's largest, grew by a record 2.2
percent in the second quarter, prompting Economy Minister Rainer
Bruederle to talk of an ""XL upswing"".
 Underlining German companies' success in tapping emerging
markets for growth, Linde  last week beat forecasts for
third-quarter profit, with its main gases division on track to
achieve record sales as demand in Asia for gases used in mining,
chemicals and petroleum refining rises sharply.
 The trade figures showed the adjusted trade surplus grew to
15.6 billion euros from 12.0 billion in August, its widest since
October 2008 and compared with expectations for 11.9 billion
euros.
 Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble defended Germany against
criticism over its export surplus in an interview with Der
Spiegel news magazine released at the weekend.
 ""The German export success is not due to any currency tricks
but rather due to the improved competitiveness of German
companies,"" said Schaeuble, who also renewed his criticism of
the U.S. Federal Reserve's move to buy $600 billion worth of
government bonds.
 ""The American growth model is stuck in a deep crisis,"" he
added.

(Recasts, adds quotes, details)
 BEIJING, Nov 8 (Reuters) - China ratcheted up pressure on
Washington over the U.S. Fed's latest moves to lift its economy
by printing more money, with a vice finance minister saying
resulting hot money inflows were a shock to global markets.
 In the run-up to this week's G20 and APEC meetings, a number
of leading economies have warned against the Federal Reserve's
decision last week to inject an extra $600 billion into the U.S.
banking system.
 ""As a major reserve currency issuer, for the United States to
launch a second round of quantitative easing at this time, we
feel that it did not recognise its responsibility to stabilise
global markets and did not think about the impact of excessive
liquidity on emerging markets,"" Chinese Vice Finance Minister Zhu
Guangyao said at a briefing on Monday.
 Zhu said that China plans ""frank discussions"" with the United
States over its money printing plans.
 China and the United States had turned down the heat in the
acrimonious dispute over currencies and trade imbalances at a
meeting of finance ministers from the 21-member Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum over the weekend.
 But Zhu said on Monday that the Fed's quantitative easing was
a poor decision. He said the United States must recognise its
role and responsibility in the global economy.
 A leading Chinese newspaper warned on Monday that
Washington's actions were a form of indirect currency
manipulation that could lead to a new round of currency wars and
even global economic collapse. [ID:nTOE6A601T]
 For his part, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in recent
days has been defending the bond-buying, saying the measures to
help restore a strong U.S. economy were critical for global
financial stability. [ID:nN06139568]
 Despite the heated rhetoric aimed at U.S. economic
policymakers, Zhu predicted on Monday that the G20 meeting would
send a positive signal to global markets.
 ""We, including the Federal Reserve, will strengthen
coordination of and communication about macroeconomic policies
and monetary policies.""
 He said the current global situation was different from that
at the height of the global financial crisis.
 ""Financial markets do not lack capital, but the capital lacks
confidence in the real economy,"" he said.

 * Yen crosses fall as euro/yen selling pressures, kiwi down
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The dollar rose sharply on Monday as
unwinding of dollar short positions that began with solid U.S.
jobs data snowballed, pushing down the euro to its lowest level
since the Federal Reserve embarked on fresh easing last week.
 Worries about debt problems in Ireland and other euro zone
countries -- while hardly new to markets -- were also cited as
hurting the common currency as markets look for trading factors
now that the Fed's quantitative easing has become reality.
 Traders said the euro triggered a succession of automatic
sell orders as it fell against the dollar, and euro/yen selling
out of Tokyo was also said to have helped send the euro lower,
which in turn weighed on other currencies against the yen.
 On the charts, euro support is expected first off at $1.3920,
the day's low, then at $1.3865, its November low, if the dollar
builds on gains made after U.S. jobs data blew past expectations
on Friday.
 ""As we've had a good run on positive U.S. data, the market is
buying back an oversold dollar,"" said Keiji Matsumoto, strategist
at Nikko Cordial Securities.
 The euro shed 0.4 percent to $1.3970 after triggering
stops as it fell through $1.4010 and then $1.3990, its low of
last Wednesday when the Fed announced plans to purchase $600
billion of Treasuries.
 The $1.3920 support is the 61.8 percent retracement of its
Oct. 20 to Nov. 4 rally to a 10-month high of $1.4283. It has
further support at $1.3835, the 76.4 percent retracement of the
same rally.
 ""I think the euro could fall to around $1.37, though I think
its trading range since October will hold,"" Matsumoto said.
 Many traders say debt problems in some euro zone countries
have reappeared on their radar. The euro was sold heavily earlier
this year as Greece struggled to finance its rising debt.
 On Friday, the cost of protecting Irish government bonds from
default and the 10-year Irish bond yield spread over benchmark
German debt hit record highs, weighing on the single currency.
 ""Given the broader spread widening on the periphery and some
ebbing in euro zone data and some pick-up in U.S. data, I'd
suggest the euro may be a sell this week,"" said Greg Gibbs,
strategist at RBS in Sydney.
 Short dollar positions built up ahead of the Fed's latest
measure to shore up the U.S. recovery and a bout of
short-covering was not unexpected.
 The dollar index, a measure of its performance against a
basket of currencies, rose 0.6 percent to 76.89, past resistance
at 76.60-70 and on course for a possible test of resistance at
77.10, where its 14-day moving average sits.
 The dollar was flat against the yen at 81.20 yen and a full
yen above its 15-year low of 80.21 yen plumbed last week.
 The market has been nervous that Japanese authorities could
intervene if the yen rises too rapidly, but data on Monday showed
they only stepped into the market once in September - on Sept.
15, the day they announced they were intervening.
 Dollar/yen's 21-day moving average is now at 81.25 yen and a
break above that could fuel more short-covering, though traders
expect it to be capped at 82 yen by sales from Japanese
exporters.
 ""I think dollar/yen will eventually rise given the backdrop
of a broad rebound in the dollar, though I suspect there will be
very heavy offers around 82 yen,"" said a trader at a Japanese
brokerage house.
 Selling in cross/yen also kept dollar/yen in check, some
traders said.
 AUSSIE DROP
 The Australian dollar dropped 0.2 percent to $1.0144, backing
off a 28-year peak of $1.0182 scaled on Friday. The New Zealand
dollar fell more than 1 percent to a low of $0.7868 at one point,
hit by investor buying into the Aussie/kiwi cross which fell to
two-month lows last week.
 Still, prospects for the greenback to perform against
higher-yielding currencies remain weak at best, as the market
sees the Fed's commitment to inject $600 billion to boost a
flagging recovery as greenlight to use the dollar as a funding
currency.
 Despite criticism from some G20 countries that the Fed's easy
stance is fuelling asset bubbles outside the United States, Fed
chairman Ben Bernanke on Saturday defended the move, saying it
was critical for global stability that the U.S. economy regains
its strength.
 Against the gloomy U.S. and euro zone backdrop,
commodity-based currencies such as the Australian dollar are
likely to remain favoured.
 Indeed, the euro dropped to a two-month low against the
Aussie to A$1.3746, not far from its record low around A$1.3654
hit in September.
 ""We see the Reserve Bank of Australia still looking to hike
rates over coming months and tentatively pencil in a
25-basis-point December hike,"" said Nomura analysts.

"
619,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2010 11:36PM ET</span>",Q+A-What's on the agenda for the G20 meeting," Nov 8 (Reuters) - The Group of 20 advanced and emerging
countries that represent 85 percent of global economic output
are meeting in Seoul on Nov. 11 and 12 to ink agreements
committing them to avoid ""competitive devaluations"" of their
currencies.
 The meeting follows on from last month's meeting of finance
ministers and central bank governors in South Korea.
 WHAT WILL BE AGREED?
 There was what the organisers termed a hardening of the
rhetoric on currencies in the final communique of the finance
ministers last month, with a shift to ""market determined""
exchange rates from ""market oriented"" in the agreement at the
previous summit in Toronto. It also called for countries to
avoid ""competitive devaluations"".
 The language of the communique agreed by leaders is
unlikely to go beyond that agreed by finance ministers and
financial markets are not pricing in any dramatic shift.
 World leaders including U.S. President Barack Obama and
Chinese President Hu Jintao will also sign a pact to agree what
will be presented as a comprehensive framework in which to
address global economic imbalances.
 The Basel III rules on bank capital and liquidity will be
endorsed by the leaders and hailed as a milestone in financial
regulation.
 There are unlikely to be firm targets on fiscal
consolidation, monetary policy, and exchange rate policies.
Optimists say the framework will be refined and that this is a
good starting point. Pessimists say the communique is just
words that are unlikely to be matched by action.
 WILL THERE BE FIRM NUMERICAL CURRENT ACCOUNT TARGETS?
 This has been dropped by the U.S. after vocal opposition
from China and Germany among others.
 The idea was a non-starter and setting a numerical target
of 4 percent of gross domestic product for a country's current
account balance was unenforceable in any case.
 A GREATER ROLE FOR EMERGING MARKETS?
 Enhancing the role of developing countries by giving them
greater voting and quota rights in the International Monetary
Fund could make them share the burden of resolving global
economic problems instead of indulging in unilateral action.
That said, this issue will be difficult to police and countries
from Brazil to South Korea are all taking measures.
 PROGRESS IN FINANCIAL REGULATION?
 Aside from endorsing Basel III world leaders will also sign
off on the Financial Stability Board's proposals on dealing
with ""too big to fail"" banks.
 However these proposals are expected to be fairly broad
with disputes over details, such as the need for additional
capital surcharges for large, inter-connected banks, unlikely
to be resolved.
 France, which takes over as G20 host after Korea, is
expected to push for new global rules that curb speculation in
commodity markets but some regulators say there is no big
appetite among many of the leaders for further reform.
 WILL THERE BE A TRADE DEAL?
 G20 members have trumpeted their commitment to free trade
and generally have not introduced new protectionary measures.
However, some of the fiscal expansion plans recently
implemented by countries as they clawed their way out of the
global economic slowdown in 2008 and 2009 directly targeted
domestic industries. There have also been some non-tariff
measures.
 In general, it has been surprising that there has not been
much protectionism, although a range of G20 economies from
Brazil to Indonesia and South Korea have imposed capital
controls.
 They are unlikely to make sufficient progress to reignite
the Doha trade round talks.
 WHAT IS SOUTH KOREA'S DEVELOPMENT AGENDA?
 It is fairly uncontentious for the countries here, although
some of the ""excluded"" 172 countries do not feel the same. That
said, the G20 represents a big step up as a more inclusive
group for development than the G7.
 Seoul has advanced an eight-pillar development agenda and
multi-year action plan for the G20 that has been generally
well-received as moving beyond the aid debate and financial
targets for donor countries that are rarely met.
 Some observers have said that poor developing economies
simply cannot mimic South Korea's turbo-charged surge to become
a high income economy and that watering down aid's importance
will let rich nations off the hook.

 SEOUL, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Tensions over exchange rates,
global economic imbalances and aggressive U.S. monetary easing
form an inauspicious backdrop to the Nov. 11-12 summit of the
Group of 20 major economies in the South Korean capital.
 Following is the roadmap that the G20 might take as it
strives to put the world economy on a sounder footing and
dampen the risk of a proliferation of currency and trade
disputes.
 WILL THE SEOUL SUMMIT BE DEEMED A SUCCESS
 Probability: high
 The acrimony over currencies and trade policy is real.
 But leaders already have two important accords in the bag
that they will endorse and brandish as evidence that they are
making the world safe from a re-run of the 2008 financial
crisis that brought the world economy to the verge of collapse.
 First, regulators have agreed on a comprehensive package of
measures to phase in tougher capital requirements for banks so
they could ride out a big shock without the need for taxpayer
bailouts.
 The G20 will also approve a related menu of options on how
to ensure the failure of a major global bank does not bring the
entire financial system to its knees
 Second, G20 finance ministers last month agreed to a
shake-up of voting power at the International Monetary Fund
that gives more say to fast-growing emerging economies such as
China.
 The deal, ratified by the IMF board on Friday, will make
the fund more representative, thus enhancing its credibility.
IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn called the change historic.
G20 leaders will surely concur.
 WILL ROWS OVER CURRENCIES SPOIL THE ROSY GLOW
 Probability: diminishing
 If G20 leaders seek in Seoul to highlight divisions over
exchange rates and monetary policy, they will have an easy
task.
 Washington blames Beijing for holding down the yuan,
China's currency, at a level it says is unfairly low, making it
impossible for U.S. firms to compete in global markets and so
destroying U.S. jobs.
 China and other emerging markets counter that the Federal
Reserve's plan to print money to buy U.S. government bonds to
try to boost growth will send footloose capital pouring their
way.
 They fear the result will be to inflate asset bubbles and
push up their exchange rates to uncompetitive levels against a
dollar that can only depreciate. German Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaueble agrees. Last week he called U.S. policy
""clueless"".
 But one of the purposes of international summits is to
instil confidence in markets by putting on a show of cohesion.
 So at a meeting of Asia-Pacific finance ministers in Kyoto
at the weekend, it was noteworthy that U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner backed away from a controversial proposal to
put a figure on how big a surplus or deficit a country may run
on its current account, the broadest measure of trade.
 The question of underlying imbalances will probably still
dominate debate in Seoul. But leaders are likely to kick the
issue down the road by instructing their officials to work on
defining ""indicative guidelines"" for current account imbalances
-- a lowest common denominator outcome that will allow everyone
to claim victory -- and asking the IMF to oversee the process.
 DO PROTECTIONIST RISKS GROW IF THE G20 SIDESTEPS BIG ISSUES
 Probability: likely, but within limits
 Slow growth and high unemployment in the United States and
most of Europe, coupled with a renewed rise in China's trade
surplus, make a fertile breeding ground for protectionism.
 Economic nationalism is in the air. Witness Canada's
rejection of a $39 billion hostile bid by BHP Billiton for
Potash Corp, or China's restrictions on exports of valuable
rare earths.
 Currency market intervention by Japan in September to hold
down the yen, and capital controls imposed by Brazil and
Thailand also smack of selfishness, purists say. The risk as
they see it is of tit-for-tat responses that distort and
destabilise markets.
 ""G20 countries have to respect the letter as well as the
spirit of the anti-protectionist pledges they have made,"" Angel
Gurria, secretary-general of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD), said.
 Julian Jessop, chief international economist at Capital
Economics in London, doubts that current account targets, while
a good idea in many respects, would amount to much in practice.
 ""But without tangible commitments from the major surplus
countries, a lurch towards protectionism and a global trade war
will be increasingly likely,"" he said in a report.
 Indeed, since their summit in June, G20 governments have
implemented 111 new measures that harm foreign commercial
interests, bringing the total to 511 since the crisis began,
according to Simon Evenett, coordinator of the Global Trade
Alert monitoring group.
 But Evenett, an economics professor at St. Gallen
University in Switzerland, said protectionism had been
contained so far.
 ""Recent currency disputes have not led to an outburst of
across-the-board tariff protection, and countries with large
current account surpluses have not been disproportionately
targeted with murkier -- that is, less transparent -- forms of
protection either,"" he said.
 WILL THE PACE QUICKEN WITH FRANCE IN THE G20 CHAIR?
 Probability: guaranteed
 France takes over the presidency of the G20 after the Seoul
summit and President Nicolas Sarkozy is itching to develop
ambitious plans to reform the international monetary order. He
also wants to make currencies and commodities less volatile.
 ""France's ambition is that everybody agrees to sit around
the table to set down the bases of a new system that guarantees
stability in the world,"" Sarkozy said last week after talks
with visiting Chinese President Hu Jintao.
 Sarkozy persuaded Hu to host a high-level seminar of
experts on these issues early in 2011. The dollar's dominance
irks both leaders, who arrived at a ""real convergence of views""
on the objectives to achieve, a French official said.
 What short-term achievements are practicable is another
matter: France has been unhappy with the dollar's hegemony
since Charles de Gaulle was president half a century ago.
 For a start, history shows that reserve currencies take a
long time to lose their status. China has proposed the IMF's
Special Drawing Right as an alternative, but most experts are
dismissive. The SDR, they object, is not even a currency but
the IMF's synthetic in-house unit of account.
 As for tackling trade imbalances, if there was an easy
solution, policy makers would have found it by now.
 And the G20 is such a broad, disparate group that the
chances of a ""grand bargain"" of new policy commitments must be
low -- at least in the absence of a new crisis that
concentrates the minds of leaders in a way that the collapse of
Lehman Brothers did in 2008 and catapulted the group to
prominence in the first place.

 * To meet Chinese leadership on eve of G20
 * Human rights criticism expected to be muted
(Adds comments by Chinese ambassador in London, details)
 By Keith Weir
 LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Prime Minister David Cameron
leads a heavyweight group of British politicians and business
chiefs on a visit to China this week which will focus squarely
on expanding trade ties with the world's second-largest
economy.
 Cameron, who took office in May, leaves London on Monday
for talks with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and President Hu
Jintao as he stops in Beijing en route to the G20 summit in
South Korea, where China's role in the global economy will be
centre stage.
 Featuring more than 40 business leaders and four senior
ministers from Cameron's Conservative-Liberal Democrat
coalition government, it is the biggest such delegation Britain
has ever sent to China.
 However, Cameron is expected to tread softly on the issue
of human rights during his 36-hour visit, disappointing critics
of China's policies.
 ""This is a vitally important trade mission. Our message is
simple: Britain is now open for business, has a very
business-friendly government, and wants to have a much, much
stronger relationship with China,"" Cameron said.
 ""I'm delighted we've got such a wide range of institutions
and businesses coming with us. This visit will mark another
step to making Britain the successful, open, trading and
pro-business country that I want it to be.""
 Liu Xiaoming, the Chinese ambassador in London, told
Communist Party mouthpiece the People's Daily that the visit
was important as both nations ""shouldered a heavy
responsibility towards promoting the global economic recovery"".
 Both countries should also join hands to fight trade
protectionism, Liu added, a call likely to be welcomed by
Britain, which has strongly espoused open markets and free
trade.
 Finance Minister George Osborne and Business Secretary
Vince Cable arrived in Beijing over the weekend.
 The visit mirrors a trip to India earlier this year when
Cameron courted business there and fits with the Conservative
leader's pledge to give a greater commercial edge to diplomacy.
 The British government has announced sharp spending cuts
and businesses are looking to overseas demand to help fill
their order books. Britain seeks to woo inward investment.
 Diplomatic ties between Britain and China have become
stronger since the British handed back Hong Kong in 1997 but
previous trade missions to the world's most populous nation
have brought relatively limited rewards.
 Trade between Britain and China is increasing, totalling
more than $35 billion in the first nine months of the year, up
by 30 percent on the previous year.
 However, officials note that Britain still does more
business with its small neighbour Ireland than it does with
Brazil, Russia, India and China combined.
 RIGHTS CRITICISM SEEN MUTED
 Western nations are competing with each other to sell more
to China's 1.3 billion people as part of efforts to rebalance
the global economy.
 Visiting France in recent days, President Hu oversaw the
signing of $20 billion worth of corporate investment contracts
and pledged to double China's annual trade with France to $80
billion over the next five years.
 China is keen to learn from Britain's experience as it
develops Shanghai into a global economic hub, and also looks to
British banks to provide know-how as Chinese banks increasingly
step out onto the global stage.
 China will be hoping that Britain does not bring up in
public thorny questions such as imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize
winner Liu Xiaobo and other dissidents such as Gao Zhisheng, as
well as avoiding too much talk about the situation in Tibet.
 Britain has called for Liu to be released and Foreign
Secretary William Hague called for greater autonomy in Tibet
during a visit earlier this year.
 Ties were also strained last year after China executed a
Briton who was caught smuggling heroin.
 ""Cameron needs to make clear to his Chinese hosts that the
UK won't soft-pedal human rights as the price for improved
trade and business ties with China,"" said Phelim Kine, Asian
researcher with New-York based Human Rights Watch.

 By Koh Gui Qing;
 SYDNEY, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Gold hit a fresh record and
Japanese shares struck three-month highs on Monday as low
interest rates in advanced economies drove investors to seek
higher returns and protection against inflation.
 The dollar rose sharply as traders continued to unwind
short positions after stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs data on
Friday, and as worries about debt problems in Ireland and other
parts of the euro zone weighed on the euro.
 Major European shares <.FTEU3> eased 0.1 percent in early
trade as investors took profits on last week's strong rally,
which had pushed some markets into ""overbought"" territory.
 ""A liquidity bubble is emerging in global markets,"" said
Kenichi Hirano, operating officer at Tachibana Securities.
""Investors increasingly believe Japanese stocks, which have
lagged behind, will also reverse course.""
 Super-loose monetary policy and tepid economic growth in
most of the developed world has fuelled the hunt for better
yields. Friday's strong U.S. jobs report further encouraged the
drive into riskier assets, although the effect was muted in the
currency market by the bounce in the U.S. dollar.
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY> against a basket of major
currencies rose 0.4 percent, extending its rebound from an
11-month low hit last week, restraining the yen  from
15-year peaks and offering some respite to Japanese exporters.
[USD/]
 Japan's Nikkei average <.N225> rose 1.1 percent to its
highest level since late July, and was the day's best performer
in Asia.
 The broader MSCI Asia ex-Japan index <.MIAPJ0000PUS> eased
0.1 percent but was still a whisker from Friday's 2-1/2-year
highs.
 Shanghai stocks <.SSEC> struck seven-month peaks and the
Indonesian bourse <.JKSE> rose to yet another record high as
foreign funds continued to flood into fast growing emerging
markets, spurred by expectations that U.S. interest rates would
stay near zero for a long time.
 Since the start of 2009, Indonesian shares have leapt 172
percent, dwarfing a mere 10 percent gain in the Nikkei over the
same period.

 INFLATION FEARS PUSH GOLD TO NEW HIGH
 Firm commodity prices led resource stocks higher across the
region, though the dollar's rebound pared gains in energy and
metals prices on Monday.
 In Japan, Sumitomo Metal Mining Co <5713.T> climbed 2.3
percent and Mitsui Mining and Smelting <5706.T> gained 2.7
percent. Australia's Rio Tinto  rose 0.2 percent.
 Gold  [GOL/], a traditional hedge against inflation,
briefly powered to a record above $1,398 an ounce on concerns
that fresh policy easing unveiled by the U.S. Federal Reserve
last week would inevitably fuel inflationary pressures that may
prove hard to snuff out.
 Crude oil  [O/R] held near two-year highs and silver
 hit 30-year peaks.
 A TURN IN EURO?
 Even though the currency market seemed to shy from risk on
Monday after a drop in the euro  below $1.40 dragged
other higher-yielding currencies down with it, some investors
were not sure if selling in the euro would last.
 In late trade, the euro was down at $1.3950, testing
support at $1.3920, the 61.8 percent retracement of its Oct. 20
to Nov. 4 rally to a 10-month highs.
 On one hand, resurging worries about debt problems in
Europe were weighing on the common currency once more. The
ten-year Irish bond yield spread over benchmark German debt hit
record highs on Friday.
 But many traders also conceded it was hard to be bullish on
the dollar given record low U.S. rates and its sluggish
economy.
 ""I think the euro could fall to around $1.37, though I
think its trading range since October will hold,"" said Keiji
Matsumoto, a strategist at Nikko Cordial Securities.

 * Analysis of EU biofuels shows negative climate impact
 * Industry says new science is insufficiently robust
 * EU Commission says will change policy if needed
 
 By Pete Harrison
 BRUSSELS, Nov 8 (Reuters) - European plans to promote
biofuels will drive farmers to convert 69,000 square km of wild
land into fields and plantations, depriving the poor of food and
accelerating climate change, a report warned on Monday.
 The impact equates to an area the size of the Republic of
Ireland.
 As a result, the extra biofuels that Europe will use over
the next decade will generate between 81 and 167 percent more
carbon dioxide than fossil fuels, says the report.
 Nine environmental groups reached the conclusion after
analysing official data on the European Union's goal of getting
10 percent of transport fuel from renewable sources by 2020.
 But the European Commission's energy team, which originally
formulated the goal, countered that the bulk of the land needed
would be found by recultivating abandoned farmland in Europe and
Asia, minimising the impact.
 New science has emerged this year casting doubt on the
sustainability of the 10 percent goal, but EU energy officials
have argued that only around two thirds of that target will be
met through biofuels, with the balance being vehicles powered by
renewable electricity.
 But 23 of the EU's 27 member states have now published their
national strategies for renewable energy, revealing that fully
9.5 percent of transport fuel will be biofuel in 2020, 90
percent of which will come from food crops, the report says.
 The EU's executive Commission is now considering whether to
tweak legislation to take account of the emerging science.
 This year's fractious quest to understand the impact of EU
biofuels policy has already led to allegations of bias, court
action against the Commission and warnings that the probes will
kill the nascent industry.
 
 TRADE DISPUTE
 The debate centres on a new concept known as ""indirect
land-use change.""
 In essence, that means that if you take a field of grain and
switch the crop to biofuel, somebody, somewhere, will go hungry
unless those missing tonnes of grain are grown elsewhere.
 The crops to make up the shortfall could come from anywhere,
and economics often dictate that will be in tropical zones,
encouraging farmers to hack out new land from fertile forests.
 Burning forests to clear that land can pump vast quantities
of climate-warming emissions into the atmosphere, enough to
cancel out any of the benefits the biofuels were meant to bring.
 The indirect effects of the EU's biofuel strategy will
generate an extra 27 to 56 million tonnes of greenhouse gas
emissions per year, says the report. In the worst case, that
would be the equivalent of putting another 26 million cars on
Europe's roads, it added.
 The UK, Spain, Germany, Italy and France are projected to
produce the most extra greenhouse gas emissions from biofuels,
generating up to 13.3, 9.5, 8.6, 5.3 and 3.9 extra million
tonnes of carbon dioxide per year respectively.
 But the whole picture is far more complex.
 The European Commission's energy team says shortfalls in
grain can be avoided in several ways, including by improving
farming yields and cultivating abandoned land.
 ""The EU has a sufficient amount of land previously used for
crop production and now no longer in arable use to cover the
land needed,"" said a statement from the Commission's energy
department. ""It makes sense to bring this land into use.""
 Biofuels producers also argue that European Union officials
should not alter biofuel-promoting policies to take account of
the new science, as it is still too uncertain.
 ""Any public policy based on such highly debatable results
would be easily challengeable at the World Trade Organisation,""
says Emmanuel Desplechin, of the Brazilian Sugarcane Industry
Association (UNICA).

631,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2010 03:04PM ET</span>",GLOBAL ECONOMY WEEKAHEAD-G20 finds common ground opposing U.S.," (Repeat of item initially transmitted Sunday, Nov 7)
 By Emily Kaiser
 WASHINGTON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The Group of 20 is beginning
to look more like the G19 plus 1 as emerging and rich countries
alike accuse the United States of breaking a vow of unity.
 This week's G20 summit will require every bit of President
Barack Obama's diplomacy skills after the Federal Reserve
embarked on a new $600 billion bond-buying spree, sparking
criticism from four continents that the U.S. central bank was
ignoring the global repercussions.
 Officials from Germany, Brazil, China and South Africa were
among those expressing concern that the Fed's money printing
could weaken the dollar, drive up commodity prices and send
uncontrollable waves of investor cash into emerging markets.
 If the G20 fails to defuse these global tensions, it may
heighten investor concerns that policymakers are drifting
further apart, leaving the world economy vulnerable to another
bout of upheaval.
 Domestic politics and policies make Obama's job tougher.
 He arrives in Seoul for the Nov. 11-12 summit weakened by a
crushing congressional election defeat for his Democratic
Party. His primary task will be to convince his peers the Fed's
actions do not run counter to a U.S.-led push for global
cooperation to even out economic imbalances.
(For a graphic on G20 economies, see
http://link.reuters.com/tah43q)
 South African Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said the
Fed's move ""undermines the spirit of multilateral cooperation
that G20 leaders have fought so hard to maintain during the
current crisis.""
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble was less
diplomatic. He called U.S. policy ""clueless.""
 It was less than five months ago that G20 leaders gathered
in Toronto, talking in warm and fuzzy terms about ""collective
well-being"" and ""shared objectives.""
 ""G20 members have a responsibility to the community of
nations to assure the overall health of the global economy,""
the leaders said in their closing statement in June.
 ""If we act in a coordinated manner, all regions are better
off, now and in the future.""
 G20 PLUS QE2 = CATCH 22
 Since that Toronto meeting, the dollar has dropped 11
percent against a basket of currencies, driving up currencies
in Japan, Brazil, the euro zone and elsewhere. The biggest
exception is China, where the tightly managed yuan has gained a
relatively modest 2 percent versus the dollar since late June.
 Obama's response to G20 criticism is expected to be that
the world needs a healthy U.S. economy, and the U.S. economy
needs healthier exports.
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke himself said a strong U.S.
economy was critical for the global recovery, and his central
bank was well aware of the dollar's ""special role"" in the
global economy and monetary system.
 Indeed, G20 members all seem to agree that the world needs
a better balance between cash-rich exporters such as China and
Germany and heavily indebted consumer countries like the United
States. The difference lies in how best to accomplish that.
 For emerging markets fearful that the Fed's flood of cash
will swamp their economies, the United States does not seem to
be keeping up its end of the ""shared objectives"" bargain.
 That makes it harder for Washington to push for policy
changes elsewhere, particular in Beijing, which insists the
yuan is not the primary culprit behind big global trade gaps.
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's proposal to set numerical
targets limiting current account imbalances was roundly
rejected at a G20 finance ministers meeting last month.
 The Obama administration was the driving force behind a
proposal adopted by the G20 in Pittsburgh last year to promote
more balanced global growth.
 That framework may be the best bet for G20 consensus at
this week's Seoul summit.
 Unlike Geithner's numerical targets, the framework for
balanced growth calls for mutual assessments to ensure domestic
policies don't disrupt global growth.
 G20 countries submitted their medium-term economic plans
for International Monetary Fund review last month. Leaders may
agree to keep this process going beyond Seoul, keeping the IMF
as arbiter.
 The Fund told the G20 nations in June that if they adopt
mutually supportive policies, they could raise global output by
$4 trillion and create 52 million jobs in the medium term.
 Unless leaders can put on a convincing show of cooperation
in Seoul this week, those loftier economic goals may remain
well out of reach.

 * Says Telenor has not been ""motivated""

(Adds Orascom confirmation, Telenor no comment, details)
 OSLO, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris
said the chances of completing a $6.6 billion merger between his
company Orascom and Russian mobile operator Vimpelcom were at
best 50 percent.
 Sawiris said Norway's Telenor -- which owns nearly 40
percent of Vimpelcom -- was ""not motivated"" to see out the
merger, which faces hurdles in Algeria as well as regulatory
issues in other countries.
 ""Now, I doubt anything will come from the merger. Telenor is
not motivated, as I see it. It's 50-50 at best that anything
will come of it,"" Sawiris told Norwegian newspaper Dagens
Naerinsliv.
 A spokeswoman at Orascom's headquarters in Cairo confirmed
the comments to Reuters on Sunday. Telenor said it had no
further comment until the merger issue returned to Vimpelcom's
board.
 Algeria has asked Orascom's local unit Djezzy -- the parent
firm's single biggest source of revenue -- to pay hundreds of
millions of dollars in back-taxes, which Orascom disputes, and
has blocked the firm from transferring money out of the country.
 Algiers derailed an earlier plan to sell Djezzy to South
Africa's MTN and is now preparing to nationalise the unit.
Analysts expect any offer from the government to be below
Djezzy's fair value.
 Orascom has assets in Bangladesh and Pakistan where Telenor
also has mobile operations, raising worries a deal with
Vimpelcom could face regulatory hurdles in those countries.
 Telenor has repeatedly aired doubts over the
Vimpelcom-Orascom deal. Late last month it asked for
clarification of the merger parameters before Vimpelcom's board
makes a final decision on the deal.

 * Tries to fend off foreign criticism on yuan

(Adds details, background)
 By Kevin Yao
 LISBON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - China hopes this week's G20 summit
in Seoul will help promote recovery in the global economy and
deepen reforms of the world's financial systems, Chinese
Commerce Minister Chen Deming said on Sunday.
 ""We hope the G20 can play a big role in promoting global
monetary reforms and governance, and help the global economy to
have strong, sustainable and balanced growth,"" Chen told Reuters
during President Hu Jintao's state visit to Portugal.
 China's trade surplus in 2011 ""will be manageable"" as the
country's foreign trade still faces global uncertainties, Chen
said.
 ""I believe China's foreign trade will continue to grow next
year but the growth will not be very strong,"" he added.
 Chinese trade officials have forecast the trade surplus in
2010 could fall to $180 billion from $196 billion in 2009.
 Concerns over global trade imbalances, largely China's huge
trade surpluses with Western nations, and the threat of
""currency war"" will top the agenda at the meeting of G20 leaders
on Nov. 11-12.
 G20 countries will try to resolve at least some of their
differences over how best to reduce the imbalances that are
destabilising the world economy.
 China has been trying to fend off foreign pressures on its
currency policy, arguing that the country has taken measures to
boost its imports to help reduce the trade surplus.
 During President Hu Jintao's recent visit to France, China
signed of around $20 billion worth of airline, petrochemicals
and nuclear fuel deals, including contracts to buy 102 Airbus
planes.
 Chen said on Friday that Beijing was not deliberately
targeting a trade surplus and would welcome a more balanced
relationship, but Europe must play a role by ensuring its own
markets were open for Chinese investment.
 Hu has given his support to President Nicholas Sarkozy's
initiatives to reform the global financial system, but the pace
of changes should be gradual, Vice Foreign Minister Fu Ying told
Reuters on Saturday.
 France, which takes up the G20 baton after the Seoul summit,
wants to build common ground for its ambitious agenda of
reforming the global monetary system, while avoiding alienating
China by harping on about the yuan.
 China has won France's understanding that the Chinese trade
surplus was mainly caused by structural factors rather than the
exchange rate, Fu said.
 ""We have gained common ground on the exchange rate issue.
China's view is that every country should take responsibilities
in maintaining stable exchange rates,"" she said.

 * Poorest countries badly hit
 * Protectionism as a whole has been contained
 
 (For release at 0001 GMT Monday, Nov. 8)
 GENEVA, Nov 8 (Reuters) - G20 states are continuing to carry
out protectionist policies in contrast to repeated pledges to
keep markets open, and developing countries have been among the
main victims, a study by independent economists said on Monday.
 The report by Global Trade Alert (GTA) finds that G20
countries have implemented 111 measures that harm foreign
commercial interests since their last summit in June this year.
 The total number of harmful measures implemented by G20
governments during the crisis and subsequent recovery has
crossed 500 to reach 511, it said in the report, brought out in
advance of this week's G20 summit in Seoul.
 ""The crossing of this dubious threshold casts further doubt
on the quality of G20 leadership on protectionism,"" Simon
Evenett, an economics professor at St. Gallen University in
Switzerland and one of the founders of GTA, said in a statement.
 The report follows a warning last week by the World Trade
Organization, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development and United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development that the global economy is threatened by increasing
protectionism, caused in part by tension over exchange rates.
 GTA, a website on which economists monitor and rate trade
measures, has been consistently more pessimistic about
protectionism than the WTO.
 In its latest report, GTA takes a more upbeat view, saying
protectionist tensions have been contained -- for now -- and
that currency tensions had not led to protectionism across the
board, but says governments continue to close their markets to
foreign competition.
 Policy-makers in rich and emerging economies generally talk
about the need to help developing countries, but GTA said that
world-wide, since the crisis began, 141 government measures have
hurt the traders and migrant workers of the 50 poorest Least
Developed Countries (LDCs).
 Of these, G20 countries were responsible for 101 of the
harmful measures, with developing country members of the G20
most active, it said, noting that India had hit LDC commercial
interests 21 times, more than other G20 members.
 GTA urged the G20 to ensure that any initiative on trade and
development revised government measures so that they do not harm
the poorest countries.
 ""Otherwise the Seoul G20 summit risks introducing yet more
incoherence into trade and development policy -- reviving
long-standing concerns that what governments give with one hand
(aid and other support) they take away with the other
(protectionism),"" Evenett said.

 * President-elect Rousseff wants fast reduction in rates
 * Meirelles could be appointed ambassador to the U.S.
 SAO PAULO, Brazil, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Brazil's
President-elect Dilma Rousseff is unlikely to ratify central
bank President Henrique Meirelles in his post, mainly because
of Meirelles' aversion to cut interest rates rapidly, O Estado
de S. Paulo newspaper reported on Sunday, citing a person with
direct knowledge of Rousseff's plans.
 Rousseff, who won a runoff vote last Sunday with about 56
percent of valid votes, wants the central bank to signal that
borrowing costs will decline during her first year of
government without risking Brazil's economic stability, the
newspaper reported, citing the source.
 According to O Globo newspaper, which cited people with
direct knowledge of her plans, Rousseff will likely resist
pressure from allies to name an austere policymaker with strong
inflation-fighting credentials. Rousseff wants someone more in
line with her pro-growth policy stance at the helm of the bank,
Globo added.
 A central bank spokesman in Brasilia declined to comment on
both reports. Rousseff's campaign advisors sought by Reuters
for comment could not be immediately reached.
 Incumbent President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva appointed
Meirelles early in 2003 to help reassure investors that his
government would not allow inflation to gather momentum.
Meirelles lifted the so-called Selic rate  shortly
after his appointment and quickly won the trust of markets.
 The role of the central bank president has been a frequent
center of controversy during Lula's almost eight years in
power. Lula allies, while praising Meirelles' efforts to keep
consumer prices in check, have claimed that higher interest
rates put the brakes on economic growth.
 Brazil has the highest borrowing costs in the world among
the world's 20 biggest economies, a fact that makes it
expensive for consumers and businesses to take on new credit to
spend.
 Critics also say that those high rates are attracting
speculative capital from overseas, boosting the value of the
country's currency, the real , and hurting Brazilian
exports overseas.
 Neither newspaper mentioned any possible candidates for the
central bank job.
 Meirelles could be offered the post of Brazil's ambassador
to the United States, the newspaper reported. Meirelles, a
former global president of Fleet Boston Corp., seems to like
the idea, Estado said.

from the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) meet
this week in Japan's port city of Yokohama to discuss
stratetgies to sustain a fragile recovery from the global
financial crisis.
 Here are some key facts about the Pacific rim group.
 MEMBERSHIP
 -- APEC's 21 member economies account for 40 percent of the
world's population (almost 3 billion people), 53 percent of
world GDP, and 44 percent of global trade.
 -- The group includes the world's three biggest economies
-- the United States, China and Japan -- and some of the
fastest growing emerging ones, such as Indonesia, Thailand and
Mexico. The other members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile,
Hong Kong, Malaysia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru,
Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan (under the
name Chinese Taipei), and Vietnam.
 MISSION
 -- APEC was launched in 1989 in Australia as an informal
dialogue among 12 members. Its leaders have met annually since
1993 focusing mainly on promoting free trade. The group
operates by consensus with no framework to negotiate binding
agreements. But it has a permanent secretariat in Singapore and
sponsors more than 100 formal and informal meetings a year.
 MATTERS
 -- The leaders are expected to adopt a new growth strategy
that emphasizes balanced, inclusive, sustainable, innovative
and secure economic growth.
 -- One of the most contentious issues in that strategy is
how to achieve balanced growth because that could include the
touchy issue of global currency realignments to ease trade
imbalances. The topic will likely dominate a summit of the G20
rich and emerging economies in Seoul just before APEC.
 -- The ministers and leaders will look at various ways of
creating a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific, which if it is
achieved, would become, by far, the world's largest.
 -- The leaders are expected to declare that the first stage
of the ""Bogor goals"" -- agreed at the 1994 summit in Bogor,
Indonesia -- has been achieved. These call for industrialised
nations to realize free and open trade and investment by 2010,
and by 2020 for developing economies.
 MODE
 -- APEC tradition calls for all participants to don native
attire for a photo shoot on the meeting's last day, which is
often the most memorable event from these annual
confabulations. Previous meetings have seen the leaders don
Chilean ponchos, U.S. bombardier jackets, Chinese silk jackets,
batik shirts, Korean Hanboks, Vietnamese silk tunics, New
Zealand sailing jackets, and Australian Drizabone raincoats.
 Japanese organisers have been tight-lipped about this
year's APEC fashion show, though speculation is that it will
have a kimono theme. The one previous time Japan hosted an APEC
summit was Osaka in 1995, when the leaders simply wore business
suits for the summit-ending class photo.

 * Sees low pound volatility vs other emerging currencies
 * Denies talk bank building reserves before elections

(Adds analyst comments, new foreign reserve figures)
 By Edmund Blair
 CAIRO, Nov 7 (Reuters) - The central bank did not intervene
last week to help the Egyptian pound recover from a five-year
low against the U.S. dollar and is not targeting exchange rate
levels for the currency, the deputy governor said on Sunday.
 The pound fell to its lowest levels since June 2005 last
week against the dollar but rebounded on Thursday after the U.S.
Federal Reserve said it would buy $600 billion of government
debt to spur the U.S. economy.
 The pound slid to 5.7770 to the dollar, around 5 percent
weaker than at the start of the year. It is now trading around
5.7140 to the greenback.
 ""There were rumours in the market on Thursday that we did
intervene, which was not the case. We did not intervene, the
market was very active,"" Deputy Governor Hisham Ramez told
Reuters, confirming comments carried in an Egyptian newspaper.
 ""We don't really target levels,"" he said when asked if the
bank had exchange rate targets. ""We care about an orderly market
and a market where the supply and demand is reflected in the
price.""
 Some investors had been unnerved by the sharp drop in the
pound because there was no sign of central bank support, and
analysts said Ramez's statement indicated the central bank would
not be upset if the pound slid even further.
 ""He has made a very confident statement. In his view he
doesn't need to intervene,"" said Angus Blair, head of research
at Beltone Financial.
 ""It indicates that the government seems content to let the
pound slip slightly further to let exports become more
competitive.
 The lack of support prompted talk that the bank might be
building up reserves to defend the pound, if needed, because of
political uncertainty ahead of a parliamentary election this
year and presidential poll next.
 When asked if the bank was seeking to boost its reserves,
Ramez said: ""Of course not. You can look at our reserves number.
We don't manage our market according to this kind of talk.""
 Official foreign reserves have climbed steadily, though
undramatically, in 2010. Reserves climbed to $35.55 billion at
end-October from $35.53 billion at end-September and $34.16
billion at the end of 2009, the central bank said on Sunday.
 However, analysts say the bank seems to have been building
up separate funds that did not immediately appear in official
figures.
 ""It is possible that the central bank has been using its
hidden reserves to counter the outflows from the fixed income
market,"" Blair said.
 Traders say the central bank often intervenes indirectly to
maintain the EGP at preferred levels via Suez Canal Bank, which
receives dollar receipts from the Suez Canal Authority, and Arab
African International Bank, whose capital is partly held in
dollars.
 Ramez played down the pound's slide, saying the bank had
announced an intervention in March 2009 when the pound was
around 5.70 to the dollar. It then strengthened to around 5.45
this year before starting to weaken again, he added.
 ""This is not very volatile if you look at the time frame,""
he said. ""If you look at volatility in the dollar-Egyptian pound
it is still very low compared to currencies in emerging
markets.""
 Ramez also said the central bank did not have concerns about
inflation, despite the pound's weakness. ""We still see inflation
under control. We are not worried about it,"" he said.
 Concerns about Egypt's future leadership have risen up the
agenda for foreign investors. President Hosni Mubarak, 82, who
has no designated successor, has not said if he will run again
in 2011, although officials suggest he will.
 The parliamentary election on Nov. 28 will be watched to see
how much space the authorities give the opposition, who complain
voting is stacked against them. Officials says voting is fair.

 * Japan says ""falling behind"", to seek more free trade pacts
 * Opposition from farmers seen behind caution on TPP deal
 * PM Kan to present trade policy to leaders at APEC meeting

 By Sumio Ito
 TOKYO, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Japan said on Saturday it would
start talking with other countries about a U.S.-led free trade
deal, but stopped short of pledging to formally join
negotiations, reflecting its worries over fallout for farmers.
 Business leaders have been urging Prime Minister Naoto Kan
to offer to join talks on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP),
warning Japanese goods could lose their competitiveness if they
are left out of the Asia-Pacific trade pact.
 But many lawmakers in the ruling Democratic Party fear an
adverse impact on Japan's long-protected and politically
powerful farmers, and have pressed for further deliberations
before formally entering talks.
 Unveiling its basic policy on free trade on Saturday, the
government said it would gather information and begin consulting
with member countries of the proposed TPP framework, but did not
say it would enter official negotations if invited.
 Kan will present this policy to other leaders at an
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit on Nov 13-14,
which Japan hosts and U.S. President Barack Obama will attend.
""We will seek to realise both the opening of our country and
the revitalisation of the agricultural sector,"" Kan said at
meeting of cabinet ministers, according to Kyodo news. ""This is
the start of our big strategy to create Japan's new prosperity.""
 
 EXPANDING GROUP
 The TPP started as a trade pact between Singapore, New
Zealand, Chile and Brunei, who have since been joined in talks
by Australia, Peru, Vietnam, Malaysia, and the United States.
 Adding Japan's $5 trillion economy would greatly increase
the potential market-opening gains of the proposed pact. But it
could also complicate the negotiations, since Tokyo would not
only have to free up agriculture but address U.S. concerns that
planned postal system reforms will hurt private competitors in
the insurance, banking and express delivery sectors.
 In a statement outlining its strategy, the government
acknowledged that it was ""falling behind"" as other countries
raced to form trade deals, and stressed the need to forge new
alliances to spur economic growth.
 It said Japan would step up efforts to finalise talks on
Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) with Australia and Peru
and restart suspended negotiations with South Korea on an EPA.
 It would also work towards a three-way free trade pact with
China and South Korea as well as other economic alliances in
Asia, while looking to enter talks soon with the European Union.
 Japan's previous trade deals have left out the heavily
protected farm sector, which holds considerable political clout
due to an electoral system that places a greater weight on rural
votes.
 Supporting farmers is a sticking point with the TPP, which
would in principle eliminate all tariffs within the zone.
 The government said it would set up a task force chaired by
the prime minister to reform and support the agricultural
sector, with a basic strategy to be hammered out next year.

 * IMF chief calls it most fundamental shift in IMF history
 * Legislative approval needed for changes to be adopted
(Adds quotes, details on board changes, G20)
 By Lesley Wroughton
 WASHINGTON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - In a historic decision, the
International Monetary Fund board agreed on Friday to boost the
voting power of big emerging economies and make China the third
leading voice in the global lender.
 ""This historic agreement is the most fundamental governance
overhaul in the fund's 65-year history and the biggest ever
shift of influence in favor of emerging market and developing
countries to recognize their growing role in the global
economy,"" IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn told a
news conference.
 Under the deal, first clinched by finance ministers of
Group of 20 leading economies in South Korea last month, 6
percent of IMF voting shares will be transferred to ""dynamic""
emerging market countries from industrial economies.
 The move would vault China over Germany, France and Britain
into third spot behind the United States and Japan. It would
also lift other large emerging powers India, Brazil and Russia
into the top 10 of the 187-member institution.
 Emerging economies have gained more clout in the IMF over
the past five years, but Friday's shift is by far the most
significant, amounting to an overhaul of the global economic
order established when the IMF was set up after World War Two.
 The IMF's member countries will vote on the reforms in the
coming weeks, with 85 percent of support needed for the changes
to pass. Some countries will also require legislative approval,
including the United States.
 Strauss-Kahn said he did not believe this week's
congressional elections in the United States, where Republicans
won control of the House of Representatives, would delay
approval in Washington.
 The move doubles IMF member quotas, or subscriptions,
boosting the lender's resources by about $755.7 billion at
current exchange rates, the fund said.
 The board also endorsed changes in its own makeup to reduce
Europe's influence on the 24-member decision-making body.
European countries will give up two of the eight or nine seats
they hold at any given time to emerging countries at the end of
two years.
 BIGGER SAY, BIGGER RESPONSIBILITY
 U.S.-China tensions have flared this year over business and
trade, but especially over China's undervalued currency that
Washington argues gives Beijing an unfair trade advantage.
 Analysts believe that unless China allows its currency to
rise significantly, the Obama administration may wait to submit
the IMF vote changes to Congress for approval.
 Strauss-Kahn said having a bigger say in the IMF came with
greater responsibility in the global economy and China
recognized that.
 ""I think (IMF reforms) may have an influence on the
behavior of the Chinese authorities. They were willing to have
this position, they were willing to be better represented in
the IMF, which shows they do care about multilateral
institutions,"" he said. ""I expect they will behave, or have in
mind the importance of their role.""
 The IMF board's approval on Friday came before next week's
G20 leaders' summit in South Korea where the United States is
seeking agreement to limit global trade imbalances.
 Emerging economies are unlikely to be sympathetic after the
U.S. Federal Reserve embarked on a new $600 billion bond-buying
spree this week, sparking criticism from Brazil, China and
South Africa that the Fed's money printing could weaken the
dollar and send a surge of investor cash into their economies.

 * China agrees to host seminar on monetary reform
 * France seeks ""gentle"" dialogue on human rights

(Adds detail)
 By Emmanuel Jarry and Kevin Yao
 NICE, France, Nov 5 (Reuters) - France and China have
reached a ""real convergence"" over the need to reform the global
financial system after two days of talks between President
Nicolas Sarkozy and his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao.
 France told China that balanced trade and close cooperation
was the best way to shield the world from future crises and the
menace of protectionism, and China promised its support for
Paris as it takes over the G20 presidency this month.
 Sarkozy has big ambitions for his year at the helm of the
Group of 20 leading economies and would score a coup if he can
get Beijing to back his goals of finding ways to reduce
volatility in commodity markets and diversify currency reserves.
 A close aide to Sarkozy said Beijing had agreed to organise
a seminar of experts in 2011 on reviewing the international
monetary system.
 Between talks with Hu in the Riviera resort of Nice and
taking him for dinner near the city's promenade, Sarkozy told
reporters the two leaders also discussed human rights and added
that he hoped France could encourage progress in that area
through ""gentle"" dialogue with Beijing.
 Of Sarkozy's aim to improve economic stability, the aide
said there was a ""real convergence of views between China and
France on the objectives to achieve.""
 ""France's ambition is that everybody agrees to sit around
the table to set down the bases of a new system that guarantees
stability in the world,"" Sarkozy later told reporters.
 
 NO TABOOS
 The statement came as global anger at a fresh round of
liquidity injections into the U.S. economy grew, notably from
emerging nations and a highly critical Germany.
 On human rights, Sarkozy said: ""Hu Jintao is somebody with
whom one can talk. There are many differences between the
Chinese and the French but we covered all subjects.""
 ""There is no taboo, notably on the issue of human rights,""
added Sarkozy, who also sat down with Hu in Paris on Thursday.
 ""To resolve the big problems in the world we need China, and
a frank, constructive, amicable dialogue,"" Sarkozy said. ""This
is what we have been doing for two days.
 Before Hu flew to Nice, French Economy Minister Christine
Lagarde told Chinese officials and business leaders that Paris
wanted much more balanced trade relations with Beijing.
 Concerns over global trade imbalances, largely China's huge
surpluses with Western nations, and the threat of ""currency
wars"" will top the agenda at next week's G20 leaders' summit in
Seoul, after which France takes on the group's presidency.
 ""The strength of our trade is the best defence against the
real risks from the financial, economic and social crises which
have struck all economies, including France of course and China,
of which protectionism is the most ugly threat,"" Lagarde said.
 France has not mentioned China's yuan currency, whose
weakness has upset Washington and the European Commission,
adopting a conciliatory approach it hopes will win over Beijing.
 But Lagarde, who said on Thursday that the U.S. monetary
easing had reinforced the need for a shake up of the global
financial system, raised French concerns over China's handling
of intellectual property rights and the openness of its markets.
 ""We're not necessarily very proud to owe China our largest
commercial deficit, 22 billion euros,"" Lagarde said. ""We must
pass to a sustainable economic cooperation founded on both a
fruitful friendship and responsibilities.""
 In response, Chinese Trade Minister Chen Deming said Beijing
was not deliberately targeting a trade surplus and would welcome
a more balanced relationship, but Europe must play a role by
ensuring its own markets were open for Chinese investment.
 
 RIGHTS CAMPAIGNERS ARRESTED
 Hu's two-nation visit to France and Portugal comes at a time
when EU leaders have closed ranks with Washington in urging
China to let the yuan appreciate more quickly, unsettling
relations between Beijing and Brussels. China hopes this week's
trip will ease those strains before the Seoul summit.
 Hu also oversaw with Sarkozy the signing of around $20
billion worth of airline, petrochemicals and nuclear fuel deals,
including contracts to buy 102 Airbus planes.
 Human rights groups have accused Sarkozy's government of
selling out to win Chinese favour. 
 The Reporters Without Borders group said six people were
arrested when protesters called for the release of a jailed
Chinese dissident awarded the 2010 Nobel peace prize as Hu's car
passed them on the Champs Elysees. Police snatched away their
big white umbrellas with ""Free Liu Xiaobo"" written on them.
 ""It is unthinkable that France, the country of human rights,
is saying nothing about the situation of China's dissidents,""
said Reporters Without Borders head Jean Francois Julliard.
 In Beijing, a senior Chinese diplomat warned European
nations against supporting Liu.
 Sino-French relations have only slowly recovered since
Sarkozy outraged Beijing in 2008 by meeting the exiled Dalai
Lama, prompting some Chinese citizens to boycott French goods.
 Sarkozy accompanied Hu on Friday for a short walk along
Nice's grand seafront promenade, a favourite spot for foreign
tourists, as several dozen Chinese students from nearby
universities waved French and Chinese flags and cheered.

 * Recovery will strengthen fundamentals for dollar
 * Inflation expectations contained, pricing power lacking
 * Fed dissenter Hoenig renews call for higher rates
 * Most dealers see Fed extending easing program
 By Pedro Nicolaci da Costa
 JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Nov 5 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday defended the U.S. central
bank's bond-buying against beggar-thy-neighbor criticism,
saying the return to a strong U.S. economy was critical for
global stability.
 He suggested doing so would bolster a dollar whose weakness
has sparked cries of foul from Bogota to Beijing.
 The Fed's decision to buy $600 billion of government debt
has drawn scathing comments from nations which contend it is
generating global instability by strengthen their currencies
against the dollar, inflating asset bubbles and fueling
inflation in their economies.
 From Berlin German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble
pronounced, ""With all due respect, U.S. policy is clueless.""
For more see [ID:nTOE6A403Y].
 Bernanke, answering questions from college students in
Florida, stressed that Fed policies aimed at giving a boost to
the weak U.S. recovery would pay dividends around the world.
 ""I think it's important to emphasize ... that a strong U.S.
economy, a recovering economy, is critical, not just for
Americans, but it's also critical for the global recovery,""
Bernanke said.
 G20 TENSIONS
 The Fed's easy monetary policy, made even looser on
Wednesday with the new bond-buying plan, has rankled emerging
market economies and others, and it looks set to be a bone of
contention at a Group of 20 nations summit in Seoul next week.
 South African Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said Fed
policy ""undermines the spirit of multilateral cooperation"" that
the G20 had sought to achieve. The money will find its way into
financial markets of emerging nations with potentially
devastating impact on their exports, he charged.
 Bernanke said U.S. policymakers were fully aware of the
dollar's importance in the global economy as a reserve
currency. The dollar has weakened sharply and did so again
after this week's decision on a new round of so-called
quantitative easing.
 ""The best fundamentals for the dollar will come when the
economy is growing strongly,"" Bernanke said. ""That's where the
fundamentals come from.""
 He told the students that while commodity prices have risen
sharply, they were the exception amid generally muted prices
for other products and should not cause a serious problem.
 Bernanke said there was ample slack in the U.S. economy
that will prevent producers from being able to fully price
costlier commodities into finished products that consumers
buy.
 ""Globally traded commodities like energy, food ... have
been going up pretty sharply,"" he said. ""Where there's a lot of
slack in the economy ... it's very, very difficult ... for
producers to push through those costs to the final consumer.""
 SLACK TO SPARE
 He added that once inflation pressures become visible, the
U.S. central bank will be ready to modify its current stance of
accommodative monetary policy to block inflation.
 Official interest rates have been near zero for nearly two
years.
 ""It's going to take some further growth and some further
reduction in slack before we begin to see any kind of inflation
pressure,"" he said.
 Not all Fed officials share Bernanke's confidence that
inflation can be held in check. Kansas City Federal Reserve
Bank President Thomas Hoenig renewed his call for higher
interest rates on Friday, saying in a speech to real estate
agents that the new bond-sales program risks igniting inflation
and another boom and bust cycle. [nN05193069]
 Critics of the Fed's easy money policy might point to signs
of improvement in the U.S. employment market, where employers
added jobs for the first time since May, as evidence the new
asset purchases are unnecessary. [nN04265378] But analysts said
the pace of job creation as not enough to pull down the
unemployment rate.
 ""It's still probably not enough to get the Fed convinced
the unemployment rate is going to go down or inflation is going
to go up,"" said John Canally, an economist at LPL Financial in
Boston.
 Most dealers polled by Reuters said they expect the Fed to
have to expand or extend its program to boost the economy with
asset sales. Economists at firms that deal directly with the
Fed said they did not expect unemployment go below 9.3 percent
before July 2011. [nN0598294]

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The dollar soared and stocks
posted modest gains on Friday after better-than-expected U.S.
jobs data fueled hopes of faster economic recovery.
 News that nonfarm payrolls rose by 151,000 in October --
more than double the expected increase -- supported the gains
seen in stock markets during the past two sessions, after the
Federal Reserve announced a second round of monetary stimulus.
 Nikkei futures traded in Chicago  were up 115 points
to 9,600 points.
 The U.S. dollar rallied against the euro and yen on the
jobs data, which showed private companies hired workers at the
fastest pace since April. For details see: [ID:nN04265378]
 The dollar rose versus a basket of major currencies, with
the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.96 percent.
 Crude oil hit a two-year high above $87 a barrel before
turning lower while gold hit a fresh record above $1,397 an
ounce, also before paring its gains. Investors bought gold on
fears the Fed's move announced Wednesday to buy more government
bonds will spur inflation and weaken the dollar going forward.
 The strong U.S. labor report helped copper flirt with
record highs as it raised confidence in the prospects for
increased demand in the world's largest economy.
 Analysts had forecast a gain of 60,000 jobs in October,
according to a Reuters poll. But the U.S. unemployment rate
remained unchanged from the previous month at 9.6 percent, a
reminder that stronger jobs growth was needed.
 ""It's both better than people had been looking for, and
it's another nail in the coffin of a double dip,"" said Nigel
Gault, chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington,
Massachusetts, referring to fears the economy would slide back
into recession.
 However, the data was ""still within the realm of a moderate
recovery,"" Gault said, a view that seemed to be reflected on
Wall Street, where markets hovered near break-even, in contrast
to better gains in Europe and elsewhere.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose
0.15 percent while the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of
leading European shares advanced 0.38 percent to 1,111.28.
 Miners ranked among Europe's best performers as metal
prices rallied sharply, with Shanghai zinc jumping 5 percent
and London copper rising to fresh 27-month highs, within $200
of a fresh record. Copper  rose to $8,655.00 per tonne.
 U.S. stocks hovered near break-even as investors mulled a
recent advance that had pushed the benchmark Dow Industrials
and S&P 500 to their highest levels since September 2008, when
markets posted their deepest slide since World War II.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 9.24
points, or 0.08 percent, to 11,444.08, while the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose 4.79 points, or 0.39 percent, to
1,225.85. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> edged up 1.64
points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,578.98.
 ""Markets got a little boost from the jobs report, but the
strengthening dollar is offsetting. In addition, the markets
have been up all week and may be running into a little
profit-taking,"" said Tom Bentz, broker at BNP Paribas Commodity
Futures Inc in New York.
 Markets jumped earlier in the week on the Fed's decision to
pump an additional $600 billion into the U.S. economy through
government bond purchases in hopes of pushing interest rates
down further and stimulating demand.
 While the jobs report will help bolster so-called risk
markets and push oil prices higher, investors want to see
sustainable gains in unemployment, said Mohamed El-Erian, who
helps oversee more than $1.1 trillion as co-chief investment
officer at Pacific Investment Management Co, or PIMCO.
 ""The longer-term impact will depend on the strength of the
all-important hand-off to permanent sources of employment
growth,"" El-Erian said.
 Spot gold  hit a fresh record of $1,397.80 an ounce,
before paring much of that gain. Gold was up $1.10 at
$1,393.30.
 U.S. crude futures  rose 36 cents to $86.85 a barrel,
having touched $87.22 earlier, the highest intraday price since
October 2008.
 The euro  was down 1.20 percent at $1.4027. Against
the Japanese yen, the dollar  was up 0.67 percent at

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The dollar could be near a
bottom versus the euro and yen after strong jobs data raised confidence in the U.S. economy, but the greenback is set to remain
weak against high-yielding and emerging market currencies. 
 The dollar soared on Friday after data showed U.S.
employers added 151,000 jobs in October, blowing past
expectations of a 60,000 rise and marking the fastest pace of
hiring since April. For details, see [ID:nN04265378]
 The report followed two days after the Federal Reserve
committed to inject $600 billion to boost the flagging recovery
and left some investors open to the possibility the dollar
may have carved a bottom against the euro and yen, despite the
prospect of more monetary easing.
 Any signs the U.S. economy is gaining momentum could prompt
investors to close out some of their massive short dollar bets
accumulated in recent weeks, lifting the greenback.
 Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on
Friday showed the value of the dollar's net short position
stood at $24.53 billion in the week ended Nov. 2, slightly up
from a net short of $23.11 billion the previous week.
[ID:nN0537627]
 ""It is very unclear if the U.S. dollar will sustain this
weakness against the yen or euro,"" said Michael Hasenstab,
portfolio manager of Templeton Global Bond Fund and co-director
of Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group's international bond
department.
 ""It is important to note that within the G-3 economies the
U.S. is not alone in its easy monetary policy,"" he added. ""The
European Central Bank continues to provide large amounts of
liquidity within its financial system to address bank and
sovereign credit vulnerabilities, and Japan continues to embark
on equally aggressive monetary easing.""
 Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group has more than $280
billion in assets under management.
 In late trading, the euro was down 1.2 percent at $1.4031
, a day after hitting a 9-1/2-month high of $1.4283 on
trading platform EBS.
 ""We're having indications that the economy is turning in
the right direction. The U.S. is regaining some traction,"" said
Thomas Kressin, senior vice president and lead portfolio
manager of Pimco's Global Investor Series FX Strategy Fund in
Munich, Germany.
 The currency fund has assets under management of about 100
million euros (roughly $140 million).
 DIVIDED VIEWS
 Concerns about the euro have also risen after Ireland's
austerity budget prompted a widening in peripheral euro zone
bond spreads. [ID:nLDE6A40HF]
 Pimco's Kressin said ""it's just a matter of time before the
market refocuses on the domestic issues in the region.""
 Investors in the options markets also turned increasingly
bearish on the euro. The euro/dollar risk reversal, a barometer
of currency sentiment, has indicated a growing negative view on
euro/dollar and the euro's ""put"" bias has deepened. On Friday,
euro/dollar risk reversals traded at -1.5 , with a
bias to euro puts, down from about -0.55 in mid-October.
 But Jonathan Xiong, director and global investment
strategist at Mellon Capital Management, said his firm recently
reversed its bearish view on the euro.
 ""We're now fairly bullish on the euro. It's actually one of
our largest overweight positions,"" he said. ""The U.S. is
heading down a very inflationary path. But in the euro zone,
they're holding up the currency value fairly well because
they're controlling inflation.""
 Xiong is part of a team that oversees $28.6 billion in
assets in San Francisco.
 The dollar rose 0.7 percent against the yen to 81.31
. The Bank of Japan concluded a policy review without
easing further. See [ID:nTOE6A400Q]
 While the dollar's fortunes may improve somewhat versus the
euro and yen, analysts expect to see it continue to weaken
versus emerging market and high-yielding currencies such as the
Australian dollar.

 * Calls bankers ""shameless"" with short memories
 * G20 and IMF looking to have closer ties
 HALIFAX, Nova Scotia, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Global financial
reforms will make the banking industry less profitable,
Canada's central bank chief said on Friday, while calling
bankers ""a little shameless"" for forgetting their past errors
so quickly.
 Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney said G20 policy makers
had already asked the financial industry to adopt stricter
rules on capital and liquidity, adding ""we're going to do more
of it.""
 ""We're going to change the way it functions. They're going
to make lower returns. It's going to be safer,"" Carney said in
a panel discussion at a security forum in the East Coast
Canadian city of Halifax.
 Carney, a former Goldman Sachs banker himself, predicted
banks would resist pressure to adopt tougher rules, especially
in countries where they did not need taxpayer-funded bailouts.
 ""Plus ... their memories are incredibly short, in terms of
what they did wrong, and they're also a little shameless. I
used to be a banker so I can say all this,"" he said.
 In order to make the reform process more inclusive, Carney
said the G20 advanced and emerging economies were in very early
stages of discussing a closer working relationship with the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank, the so-called
Bretton Woods institutions.
 ""There are very valid discussions about the fusion of the
membership or the structure for the G20 with the the Bretton
Woods institutions, so you would have a more constituency-based
approach as you do with the IMF, so everyone is actually
represented,"" Carney said in the panel discussion.
 ""It is ultimately probably going to be needed for this to
be fully successful,"" he said.
 Carney said the current mix of fixed and floating
currencies globally was a top threat to financial
stability.
 ""It's a mixture of fixed and floating currencies that is
beginning to foster not just disinflationary or deflationary
risks in some advanced countries but inflationary risks in
emerging markets ... in a post-crisis environment of tremendous
debt, obviously the former is a great great risk.""

 By Pedro Nicolaci da Costa
 JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Nov 5 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday defended the U.S. central
bank's bond-buying against beggar-thy-neighbor criticism,
saying it was ""critical"" for global stability that the U.S.
economy regain its strength.
 Doing so, he suggested, would bolster a dollar whose
weakness has sparked cries of foul from Bogota to Beijing.
 The U.S. central bank's decision to buy $600 billion of
government debt has drawn scathing comments from a host of
nations who contend it is generating global instability by
ramping up their currencies against the dollar, inflating asset
bubbles and stoking inflation in their economies.
 ""With all due respect, U.S. policy is clueless,"" German
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said in Berlin. For more
see [ID:nTOE6A403Y].
 Bernanke, answering questions from college students,
stressed that Fed policies aimed at giving a boost to the weak
U.S. recovery would pay dividends around the world.
 ""I think it's important to emphasize ... that a strong U.S.
economy, a recovering economy, is critical, not just for
Americans but it's also critical for the global recovery,""
Bernanke said.
 The Fed's easy monetary policy, ramped up on Wednesday with
the new bond-buying plan, has rankled, especially among
emerging market economies and it looks set to be a bone of
contention at a G20 summit in Seoul next week.
 South African Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said Fed
policy ""undermines the spirit of multilateral cooperation"" that
the G20 had sought to achieve. The money will find its way into
financial markets of emerging nations with potentially
devastating impact on their exports, he charged.
 Bernanke said U.S. policymakers were fully aware of the
dollar's importance in the global economy as a reserve
currency. The dollar has weakened sharply and did so again
after this week's decision on a new round of so-called
quantitative easing.
 ""The best fundamentals for the dollar will come when the
economy is growing strongly,"" Bernanke said. ""That's where the
fundamentals come from."" For a full text on his comments on the
focus of U.S. policy and the dollar see [ID:nWEN2671].
 He told the students that while commodity prices have risen
sharply, they were the exception amid generally muted prices
for other products and should not cause a serious problem.
 Bernanke said there was ample slack in the U.S. economy
that will prevent producers from being able to fully price
costlier commodities into finished products that consumers
buy.
 He added that once inflation pressures become visible, the
U.S. central bank will be ready to modify its current stance of
accommodative monetary policy to block inflation. Official
interest rates have been near zero for nearly two years.
 For the moment, inflation expectations appear to be quite
low, Bernanke said, adding the Fed was committed to keeping
them that way and expressing confidence it had the tools to do
so.

 * Says China currency moves should be gradual, not sharp
 OTTAWA, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Canada wants a G20 summit next
week to make more progress on the sensitive questions of
currency flexibility and current account balances, a senior
government official said on Friday.
 Leaders of the Group of 20 rich and emerging nations will
hold a summit in South Korea next week amid increasing tensions
over foreign exchange rates and fears that a so-called currency
war could break out.
 Developed countries are upset with China's policy of
keeping its yuan artificially low and want Beijing to let it
float higher.
 And, in recent days, some G20 members criticized the United
States for driving down the value of its dollar by announcing a
plan to pump more cash into the sluggish economy.
 ""Canada fundamentally is looking for more progress on the
whole question of currencies,"" the official told a briefing.
 Canada also wants the G20 to agree to targets for current
account imbalances as a central part of an action plan due to
be adopted in Seoul next week.
 ""We fully support the adoption of a current account
target,"" an official said, but did not give a specific number.
 Prime Minister Stephen Harper has sent a letter to his G20
counterparts about ""the role played by the persistence of large
and unsustainable current account imbalances in deficit and
surplus countries"", said spokesman Dimitri Soudas.
 ""In Seoul, we should have a frank discussion on how to
narrow these imbalances and facilitate the required rotation in
global demand,"" he quoted the letter as saying.
 The officials said the tensions over currencies showed the
importance of the G20, an organization that some critics says
is too large and divided to work effectively.
 ""Canada's top priority at the Seoul summit will be to
secure agreement on an action plan ... (which) in the short
term encourages greater exchange rate flexibility,"" said
Soudas. Another official said Canada did not want large and
potentially disruptive moves in the yuan.
 ""We think in the Chinese context -- domestic as well as
international -- that a sustained modest appreciation of their
exchange rate is in both their interest and in ours,"" he said.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The dollar could be near a
bottom versus the euro and yen as optimism about the U.S.
economy grows after Friday's surprisingly strong jobs data,
even though it's set to remain weak against high-yielding and
emerging market currencies.
 The dollar soared on Friday after data showed U.S.
employers added 151,000 jobs in October, blowing past
expectations of a 60,000 rise and marking the fastest pace of
hiring since April. For details, see [ID:nN04265378]
 The report came two days after the Federal Reserve
committed to inject $600 billion to boost the flagging recovery
and left some investors open to the possibility that the dollar
may have carved a bottom against its biggest rivals, despite
the prospect of more monetary easing.
 ""It is very unclear if the U.S. dollar will sustain this
weakness against the yen or euro,"" said Michael Hasenstab,
portfolio manager of Templeton Global Bond Fund and co-director
of Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group's international bond
department.
 ""It is important to note that within the G-3 economies the
U.S. is not alone is its easy monetary policy,"" he added. ""The
European Central Bank continues to provide large amounts of
liquidity within its financial system to address bank and
sovereign credit vulnerabilities, and Japan continues to embark
on equally aggressive monetary easing.""
 Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group has more than $280
billion in assets under management.
 In afternoon trading, the euro was down 1 percent at
$1.4057 , a day after hitting a 9-1/2-month high of
$1.4283 on trading platform EBS.
 ""We're having indications that the economy is turning in
the right direction. The U.S. is regaining some traction,"" said
Thomas Kressin, senior vice president and lead portfolio
manager of Pimco's Global Investor Series FX Strategy Fund in
Munich, Germany.
 The currency fund has assets under management of about 100
million euros (roughly $140 million).
 DOLLAR MAY END STRUGGLE WITH EURO
 Concerns about the euro have also risen after Ireland's
austerity budget prompted a widening in peripheral euro zone
bond spreads. The premium investors demand to hold 10-year
Irish government bonds rather than German benchmarks rose to a
euro lifetime high after Dublin proposed a budget that some
traders said was ""unrealistic."" [ID:nLDE6A40HF]
 ""It's just a matter of time before the market refocuses on
the domestic issues in the region,"" said Pimco's Kressin.
 Investors in the options markets also turned increasingly
bearish on the euro. The euro/dollar risk reversal, a barometer
of currency sentiment, has indicated a growing negative view on
euro/dollar and the euro's ""put"" bias has deepened.
 On Friday, euro/dollar risk reversals traded at -1.425
, according to GFI data, with a bias to euro
puts.
 The dollar rose 0.7 percent against the yen to 81.28
. Traders cited talk of huge stop-loss buy orders
above 82.00. On previous runs to that level, the pair saw heavy
selling from Japanese corporates and U.S. institutional funds.
 The Bank of Japan concluded a policy review without easing
further. The yen earlier firmed slightly on disappointment that
the central bank did not unveil any expansion of its asset
buying in response to that of the Fed.
 The dollar was up around 0.8 percent versus a currency
basket <.DXY> at 76.479, bouncing from an 11-month low of
75.631 touched on Thursday.
 While the dollar's fortunes may improve somewhat versus the
euro and yen, analysts expect to see it continue to weaken
versus emerging market and high-yielding currencies such as the
Australian dollar.
 ""Continued and aggressive quantitative easing by the U.S.
is one of the factors that will likely lead to a further fall
of the U.S. dollar versus the currencies of countries that are
not pursuing such lax monetary policy, such as those in
non-Japan Asia,"" Hasenstab said.

(Adds detail, context)
 By Raymond Colitt
 BRASILIA, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Brazil will ask the World Trade
Organization to open a dispute panel over European Union
poultry regulations it considers illegal, a senior government
official told Reuters on Friday.
 ""We've concluded that we have a strong case and will
proceed,"" said Carlos Marcio Cozendey, head of the foreign
ministry's department of economics.
 Latin America's largest country has become a major player
in international trade negotiations in recent years in line
with the growing importance of its booming economy.
 Brazil's poultry exports are the largest in the world and
generated revenues of around $7 billion in 2008, before the
financial crisis tempered global demand.
 The EU, which adopted new regulations in May restricting
the sale of certain thawed poultry products, is Brazil's
third-largest market.
 Brussels says that the measures apply also to its own
poultry producers. But Brazil argues they discriminate against
non-EU suppliers, who mostly ship frozen, not fresh poultry.
 In the first half of the year, Brazil's chicken exports to
the EU fell to 206,000 tonnes, down 19.2 percent from 2009.
 The government could present its case to the WTO before the
end of the year, but was still detailing its report and
calculating estimated damages to the industry, Cozendey said.

 NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The dollar rose but global
stocks wavered on Friday after U.S. employers added more jobs
than expected last month in a surprising gain that fueled hopes
the U.S. economy is on a faster pace to healthier growth.
 News that nonfarm payrolls rose by 151,000 in October --
more than double the expected increase -- initially lifted
markets that had leveled off after a Federal Reserve move to
spur growth had fueled gains earlier this week in risk assets.
 The U.S. dollar rallied against the euro and yen on U.S.
Labor Department data that showed private companies hired
workers at the fastest pace since April. For details see:
[ID:nN04265378]
 The dollar rose versus a basket of major currencies, with
the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.84 percent at 76.517.
 Crude oil hit a two-year high above $87 a barrel before
turning lower while gold hit a fresh record above $1,397 an
ounce, also before paring its gains. Investors bought gold on
fears the Fed's move announced Wedneday to buy more government
bonds will spur inflation and weaken the dollar going forward.
 The strong U.S. labor report helped copper flirt with
record highs as it raised confidence in the prospects for
increased demand in the world's largest economy.
 Analysts had forecast a gain of 60,000 jobs in October,
according to a Reuters poll. But the U.S. unemployment rate
remained unchanged from the previous month at 9.6 percent, a
reminder that better jobs growth was needed.
 ""It's both better than people had been looking for, and
it's another nail in the coffin of a double dip,"" said Nigel
Gault, chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington,
Massachusetts, referring to fears the economy would slide back
into recession.
 However, the data was ""still within the realm of a moderate
recovery,"" Gault said, a view that seemed to be reflected on
Wall Street, where markets hovered near break-even, in contrast
to better gains in Europe and elsewhere.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose
0.1 percent while the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of
leading European shares advanced 0.3 percent to 1,110.06.
 Miners ranked among Europe's best performers as metal
prices rallied sharply, with Shanghai zinc jumping 5 percent
and London copper rising to fresh 27-month highs, within $200
of a fresh record. Copper  rose to $8,769.50 per tonne.
 U.S. stocks hovered near break-even as investors mulled a
recent advance that had pushed the benchmark Dow Industrials
and S&P 500 to their highest levels since September 2008 when
markets accelerated their deepest slide since World War II.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 14.68
points, or 0.13 percent, at 11,420.16. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 2.41 points, or 0.20 percent, at
1,223.47. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 2.19
points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,575.15.
 ""Markets got a little boost from the jobs report, but the
strengthening dollar is offsetting. In addition, the markets
have been up all week and may be running into a little
profit-taking,"" said Tom Bentz, broker at BNP Paribas Commodity
Futures Inc in New York.
 Markets jumped earlier in the week on the Fed's decision to
pump an additional $600 billion into the U.S. economy through
government bond purchases in hopes of pushing interest rates
down further and stimulating demand.
 While the jobs report will help bolster so-called risk
markets and push oil prices higher, investors want to see
sustainable gains in unemployment, said Mohamed El-Erian, who
helps oversee more than $1.1 trillion as co-chief investment
officer at Pacific Investment Management Co, or PIMCO.
 ""The longer-term impact will depend on the strength of the
all-important hand-off to permanent sources of employment

franchise by developing a long-term, top-tier presence in the

global capital markets, said in a statement.
 Scotiabank, like Canada's other lenders, emerged from the

 Now, with the industry rebounding, Scotiabank and some of
its domestic rivals are pushing to build share in foreign

 By Stella Mapenzauswa
 JOHANNESBURG, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The United States' decision
to launch a second round of monetary easing was made without
consideration for its negative impact on other countries, South
African Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said on Friday.
 Signalling a tougher stance from South Africa, which has
urged countries to refrain from weakening their currencies and
undermining economies global, Gordhan said the move would force
developing states to ""take more steps to mitigate the impact of
the increased flows into their financial markets"".
 ""Developing countries, including South Africa, will bear the
brunt of the U.S. decision to open its flood gates without due
consideration of the consequences for other nations,"" he said in
a statement.
 ""The decision undermines the spirit of multilateral
cooperation that G20 leaders have fought so hard to maintain
during the current crisis. It also runs contrary to the spirit
in which G20 Finance Ministers and central bank governors met
recently in South Korea.""
 Gordhan urged nations to find ""the right balance between
measures aimed at protecting national interests and globally
coordinated policies"".
 The  traded at 6.7980 to the dollar at 1557 GMT, up
0.33 percent on the day and hovering close to its highest level
in nearly three years.
 The currency's gains this week were triggered by the Federal
Reserve's decision on Wednesday to buy more government debt to
help stimulate the ailing U.S. economy. [ID:nnN03290614]
 Gordhan said most of the $600 billion the Fed would pump
into the U.S. economy would find its way into the financial
markets of emerging market countries, strengthening their
currencies ""with devastating consequences for exports from
developing countries"".
 Emerging market currencies, including the rand, have soared
in value as investors faced with minimal interest rates in
crisis-hit developed economies seek higher returns elsewhere.
 In its medium term budget statement last week, the Treasury
said Africa's biggest economy had few options to devalue the
rand in the face of increased capital inflows.
 
 MORE FUNDS TO BUY RESERVES
 Gordhan also told a media briefing at that time the
government would give further funds to the central bank for
reserves accumulation. [ID:nLDE69Q1Q1]
 Data on Friday showed South Africa's net reserves rose more
than expected to $43.112 billion at the end of October from
$40.854 billion in September, pointing to more aggressive
intervention in the market by the central bank.
 The Treasury has also said it will further relax exchange
controls, with individuals allowed to take more money abroad.
 But South Africa had yet to move decisively to implement
most of the options spelt out in the budget statement, said
Nomura International analyst Peter Attard Montalto.
 ""They should hurry up and do that, particularly on the
capital control front, the earlier the better,"" he told Reuters.
 ""I continue to think we see more (in the main budget speech)
in February as the government will not be happy with the rand
still roughly where it is now.""

 SAO PAULO/SANTIAGO, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The currencies of
Chile and Mexico firmed on Friday after strong U.S. jobs data
raised hopes about demand for both countries' exports.
 But Brazil's real traded flat as the dollar recovered from
sharp losses in the wake of U.S. stimulus measures.
 The Chilean peso  gained 0.6 percent to 476.7 per
dollar as the price of copper, the country's main export, hit a
2-year high. [ID:nSGE6A4055]
 Data showing the United States added more jobs than
expected in October lifted hopes about the global recovery,
boosting the price of many industrial metals. [ID:nN0528209]
 After soaring as much as 2.1 percent on Thursday, the peso
was set for a weekly gain of 2.6 percent, its biggest since
February this year.
 Like many other Latin American currencies, Chile's peso has
soared in recent months, putting pressure on the country's
exporters.
 The peso barely budged after the country's central bank on
Thursday announced fresh measures to encourage outflows and
ease the peso's recent rally.[ID:nN04221079]

currency plays in Latin America,"" they said.
 The Mexican currency  also fared slightly better
thanks to improved U.S. jobs data. The United States buys about
80 percent of Mexico's exports and the peso is very sensitive
to the changing outlook for the U.S. economy.
 The peso firmed 0.28 percent to 12.198 per dollar and was
heading for a weekly gain of 1.18 percent.
 BRAZIL'S REAL PAUSES FOR BREATH
 Brazil's real struggled as the dollar gained in global
markets. The U.S. data had less direct impact on Brazil, which
counts China as its top trading partner.
 The dollar had plummeted on Thursday following the U.S.
Federal Reserve's decision to pump $600 billion into the
economy, boosting Brazil's real to a two-week high and giving
Chile's peso its biggest one-day gain in more than a year.
 On Brazil's local spot market, the bid quote for the real
 opened weaker on Friday but was later flat at 1.677
against the dollar. The currency was set to have firmed 1.4
percent over the week thanks to the post-Fed boost, its biggest
weekly gain in five weeks.
 ""The slight appreciation of the dollar in international
markets should allow for a technical adjustment to the local
exchange rate after the strong moves yesterday,"" said Luciano
Rostagno, chief strategist for CM Capital Markets in Sao Paulo.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The dollar rallied on Friday as
unexpectedly strong U.S. job gains in October suggested the
economy may well be on a stable road to recovery.
 The nonfarm payrolls data came two days after the Federal
Reserve committed to inject $600 billion to boost the flagging
economy and gave the greenback temporary relief from a broad
sell-off.
 The strong jobs data left some investors open to the
possibility that the dollar may have carved a bottom against
the euro, despite the prospect of more quantitative easing.
 The Labor Department reported the U.S. economy added
151,000 jobs in October, blowing past expectations for a 60,000
rise and marking the fastest pace of hiring since April.
 ""Given that we have seen improving numbers since June and
combine that with better business sentiment numbers, we're
having indications that the economy is turning in the right
direction. The U.S. is regaining some traction,"" said Thomas
Kressin, senior vice president and lead portfolio manager of
Pimco's Global Investor Series FX Strategy Fund in Munich,
Germany.
 The currency fund has assets under management of about 100
million euros (roughly $140 million).
 In midday trading, the euro was down 1.1 percent at
$1.4035, a day after hitting a 9-1/2-month high of $1.4283. It
earlier fell to a session low at $1.4027, according to EBS
data, in the wake of the jobs data..
 Market participants had been selling the euro anyway as
concerns over Ireland's austerity budget prompted a widening in
peripheral euro zone bond spreads. The premium investors demand
to hold 10-year Irish government bonds rather than the
perceived safety of German benchmarks rose to a euro lifetime
high after Dublin proposed a budget that some traders said was
""unrealistic.""
 DOLLAR MAY END STRUGGLE WITH EURO
 ""I have a difficult time believing that the dollar will
continue to underperform vis-a-vis the developed world,
especially the euro, given the problems we have in the euro
zone,"" said Pimco's Kressin. ""It's just a matter of time before
the market refocuses on the domestic issues in the region.""
 Kressin added that the quantitative-easing theme has been
played out in the market the last several months, and the
dollar would need a new driver for it to weaken further. ""It's
tough to see that right now,"" he said.
 Traders said stop-losses in the euro were hit all the way
down while a surprise drop in German manufacturing orders also
dented euro sentiment.
 Investors in the options markets have also turned
increasingly bearish on the euro following the jobs report.
 The euro/dollar risk reversal, a barometer of currency
sentiment, has been indicating a decline in the curve or a
growing negative view on the pair the last few weeks. But the
euro's ""put"" bias deepened on Friday.
 Euro puts are being traded at a mid-market of -1.125 vols,
according to GFI data, with bids at -1.50. A week ago, the
mid-market level was at -0.925.
 Some strategists, however, do not expect the euro to fall
significantly versus the dollar even with sovereign debt
concerns in the euro zone and the robust U.S. payrolls report.
 ""The FX reaction is remarkable for the initial negative
euro/dollar response, but this is not seen leading to a serious
challenge of key downside levels,"" said Alan Ruskin, global
head of currency strategy at Deutsche Bank.
 ""We need a string of these kinds of numbers before it is
realistic to flirt with the Fed terminating the QE2 exercise
before the Q2 2011 'due date.'""
 The dollar rose 0.7 percent against the yen to 81.29, not
far from session highs at 81.48. Traders cited talk of huge
stop-loss buy orders above 82.00. On previous runs to that
level, the currency pair had faced heavy selling from Japanese
corporates and U.S. institutional funds.
 The Bank of Japan earlier concluded a policy review without
easing further. The yen firmed slightly after the announcement
on disappointment that the central bank had not unveiled any
expansion of its asset buying plan in response to that of the
Fed.
 The dollar was up around 0.9 percent versus a currency
basket at 76.527, bouncing from an 11-month low touched on
Thursday of 75.631.

 * Hu pledges backing for France as G20 president 
 * Sarkozy to entertain Hu in upscale Riviera resort

(adds Hu's arrival in Nice, activists' arrests 12, 14-16)
 By Kevin Yao and Emmanuel Jarry
 NICE, France, Nov 5 (Reuters) - France told China on Friday
that balanced trade and close cooperation was the best way to
protect world economies from future crises and the menace of
protectionism.
 Shortly before Chinese President Hu Jintao and his French
counterpart Nicolas Sarkozy were to hold talks in the
Mediterranean resort of Nice, France's Economy Minister
Christine Lagarde told Chinese officials and business leaders
Paris wanted much more balanced trade relations with Beijing.
 Concerns over global trade imbalances and the threat of
""currency wars"" will top the agenda at next week's G20 leaders
summit in Seoul, after which France will assume the group's
presidency with ambitious plans to push global financial reform.
 ""The strength of our trade is the best defence against the
real risks from the financial, economic and social crises which
have struck all economies, including France of course and China,
of which protectionism is the most ugly threat,"" Lagarde said.
 Sarkozy, who held earlier talks with Hu in Paris on
Thursday, is using the visit to build relations and gauge
China's position on his G20 agenda. French officials have said
Beijing's backing will be crucial for its plans to diversify
global currency reserves and stabilise commodity markets.
 France has avoided any reference to sensitive issues such as
human rights or China's yuan -- the weakness of which has
affected trade flows and upset Washington and Brussels --
adopting a conciliatory approach it hopes will win over Beijing.
 But Lagarde, who on Thursday said US monetary easing this
week had reinforced the need for a shake up of the global
financial system, raised French concerns over China's handling
of intellectual property rights and the openness of its markets.
 ""We're not necessarily very proud to owe China our largest
commercial deficit, 22 billion euros,"" Lagarde said. ""We must
pass to a sustainable economic cooperation founded on both a
fruitful friendship and responsibilities.""
 In response, Chinese Trade Minister Chen Deming said Beijing
was not deliberately targeting a trade surplus and would welcome
a more balanced relationship, but Europe must play a role by
ensuring its own markets were open for Chinese investment.
 
 RIGHTS CAMPAIGNERS ARRESTED
 Hu's two-nation visit to France and Portugal comes at a time
when EU leaders have closed ranks with Washington in urging
China to let the yuan appreciate more quickly, unsettling
relations between Beijing and Brussels. China hopes this week's
trip will ease those strains ahead of the Seoul summit.
 Hu pledged on Thursday his backing for France's G20 agenda
and together with Sarkozy oversaw the signing of around $20
billion worth of airline, petrochemicals and nuclear fuel deals,
including contracts to buy 102 Airbus planes.
 On Friday, he arrived in Nice to be greeted by Mayor
Christian Estrosi, who is also France's industry minister.
 Afternoon talks with Sarkozy were due to focus on
international affairs, including Iran's nuclear programme,
Afghanistan and Pakistan, and Africa, where resource-hungry
Chinese firms are investing heavily in many French ex-colonies.
 Human rights groups have accused Sarkozy's government of
selling out to win Chinese favour. Reporters Without Borders
said six people were arrested when protestors called for the
release of a jailed Chinese dissident awarded the 2010 Nobel
peace prize as Hu's car passed them on the Champs Elysees after
he laid a wreath on the tomb of France's unknown soldier.
 Police snatched away their big white umbrellas with ""Free
Liu Xiaobo"" written on them.
 ""It is unthinkable that France, the country of human rights,
is saying nothing about the situation of China's dissidents,""
said Reporters Without Borders head Jean Francois Julliard.
 Sino-French relations have only slowly recovered since
Sarkozy outraged Beijing in 2008 by meeting the exiled Dalai
Lama, prompting some Chinese citizens to boycott French goods.
 Later on Friday, Sarkozy will show Hu Nice's grand
palm-fringed seaside promenade, one of the most-visited spots in
France outside of Paris, and take him to dine at a downtown
restaurant known for its fresh seafood.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Global stocks, the dollar and
crude oil rose on Friday after U.S. employers added more jobs
than expected last month in a surprising gain that fueled hopes
that the U.S. economy is on a faster pace to healthier growth.
 News that nonfarm payrolls rose by 151,000 in October --
more than double the expected increase -- lifted markets that
had leveled off after a Federal Reserve move earlier in the
week to spur faster growth had fueled gains in risk assets.
 The U.S. dollar rallied against the euro and yen, while oil
hit a two-year high above $87 a barrel on U.S. Labor Department
data that showed private companies hired workers at the fastest
pace since April. For details see: [ID:nN04265378]
 The dollar rose versus a basket of major currencies, with
the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.68 percent at 76.395.
 Analysts had forecast a gain of 60,000 jobs in October,
according to a Reuters poll, even as the U.S. unemployment rate
remained unchanged from the previous month at 9.6 percent.
 ""It's both better than people had been looking for, and
it's another nail in the coffin of a double dip,"" said Nigel
Gault, chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington,
Massachusetts, referring to fears the economy would slide back
into recession.
 However, the data was ""still within the realm of a moderate
recovery,"" Gault said, a view that seemed to be reflected on
Wall Street, where markets hovered near break-even, in contrast
to better gains in Europe and elsewhere.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose
0.2 percent while the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of
leading European shares advanced 0.5 percent to 1,112.97.
 ""It was a stunning turnaround but you have to question
whether it is sustainable,"" said Peter Dixon, an economist at
Commerzbank. ""But for now, with the quantitative easing
announced on Wednesday, it is a 'win-win' for equities.""
 Dixon referred to the Fed's decision to pump an additional
$600 billion into the U.S. economy through government bond
purchases in hopes of pushing interest rates down further and
stimulating demand. Markets jumped Thursday on the decision.
 Miners ranked among Europe's best performers as metal
prices rallied sharply, with Shanghai zinc jumping 5 percent
and London copper rising to fresh 27-month highs, within $200
of a fresh record. Copper  rose to $8,769.50 per tonne.
 On Wall Street, the S&P 500 edged higher as banking stocks
surged following reports in the last session that the Fed would
allow some stronger banks to increase dividend payments.
[ID:nN05189917] But the Dow dipped a day after closing at its
highest level since Lehman Brothers' demise in September 2008.
The Nasdaq also slipped.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 13.88
points, or 0.12 percent, at 11,420.96. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 2.23 points, or 0.18 percent, at
1,223.29. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 3.08
points, or 0.12 percent, at 2,574.26.
 While the jobs report will help bolster so-called risk
markets and push oil prices higher, investors want to see
sustainable gains in unemployment, said Mohamed El-Erian, who
helps oversee more than $1.1 trillion as co-chief investment
officer at Pacific Investment Management Co, or PIMCO.
 ""The longer-term impact will depend on the strength of the
all-important hand-off to permanent sources of employment
growth,"" El-Erian said.
 Gold hit a fresh record, with spot gold prices  up
$4.95 at $1,397.20 an ounce.
 U.S. crude futures  rose 22 cents at $86.70 a barrel,
having touched $87.22 earlier, the highest intraday price since
October 2008.
 ICE Brent futures  rose 1 cent to $88.10.
 The euro  was down nearly 1 percent at $1.4060, and
against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was up 0.62 percent

yield to its highest level since June, as the jobs data erased
the safe-haven appeal of government debt. [ID:nN05330484]
 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  slid 29/32 in

 By Louise Egan
 OTTAWA, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Canadian employment numbers
barely inched higher in October as the sputtering economy
created far fewer jobs than forecast, and left expectations
intact for interest rates to stay on hold.
 About 3,000 people -- a number considered negligible --
found work in the month, according to Statistics Canada data
released on Friday. That was not enough to offset the 6,600
jobs lost in September and well below the 15,000 employment
gain forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll.
 Job gains in recent months have been a fraction of those
seen earlier this year. Statscan said the average monthly
employment growth was 5,700 in the past four months compared
with 51,000 in the first half.
 ""I think there might be a trace of disappointment on the
headline number, but I think on balance this doesn't move the
needle in a major way,"" said Doug Porter, deputy chief
economist at BMO Capital Markets.
 All the gains were in full-time jobs and private sector
hiring outpaced that of the public sector, suggesting the
recovery was becoming more entrenched.
 The unemployment rate eased to 7.9 percent from 8 percent
in September mainly because fewer people were in the labor
force actively looking for work.
 Other reports on Friday on the construction and housing
sectors were mixed. Statscan said building permits soared 15.3
percent in September, largely due to a resurgence in plans for
single-family housing.
 But the Canadian Real Estate Association issued gloomy
forecasts for home resales this year, predicting a decline of
4.9 percent versus its previous estimate of a 1.2 percent
decline.
 RATES ON HOLD
 The data cocktail did little to change analysts' view that
the Bank of Canada will stand pat on interest rates until well
into 2011. The bank kept its key rate on hold last month at 1
percent after three straight increases.
 ""We expect the bank to stay on the sidelines for the
remainder of the year with the next hike likely only after
there is solid evidence that concerns about both the external
and domestic developments have abated,"" said Dawn Desjardins,
assistant chief economist at RBC Economics.
 Markets see a 97 percent probability the central bank will
hold rates steady on Dec. 7 and expect no further hike until
roughly mid-2011, according to a Reuters calculation of yields
on overnight index swaps. 
 The Canadian dollar  fell to a session low of
C$1.0095 to the U.S. dollar, or 99.06 U.S. cents, immediately
after the Canadian employment report, but it quickly pared
losses as markets digested the details. The currency shot up
again after the U.S. data to hit parity against the greenback.
 DETAILS ENCOURAGING
 The heaviest hiring took place in the information, culture
and recreation sector, followed by construction, manufacturing
and agriculture. Retail and wholesale trade let go workers.
 Some details in the report were more encouraging. All the
gains were in full-time jobs, while part-time employment fell
for a third straight month. In the first half of this year
part-time jobs grew almost three times as fast as full-time
ones.
 Similarly, private sector hiring outpaced that of the
public sector, suggesting a more deeply entrenched recovery.
 The average hourly wage of permanent employees, closely
watched by the Bank of Canada for inflation pressures, rose 2.1
percent in October from a year earlier. The equivalent figure
for September was 2.5 percent.
 Unlike in the United States, Canadian employment levels
have returned to pre-recession levels. But Statscan said the
jobless rate has stayed stubbornly above the pre-crisis 6.2
percent level largely because the working-age population has
grown 2.9 percent and the labor force -- those looking for work
-- has risen 1.9 percent.
 Despite the gains, full-time employment remains well below
its peak, prompting concerns about the quality of jobs.
 A report by CIBC this week said the public sector and
construction industry, helped by stimulus spending, have
accounted for one-third of all jobs created during the
recovery.

 * Delbeke: Debate may resume on carbon tariffs on imports
 
 By David Stanway and Pete Harrison
 BEIJING/BRUSSELS, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The European Union sees
the United States ""disappearing as a partner"" in international
climate talks after President Barack Obama suffered setbacks in
midterm elections, the EU's top climate official said on Friday.
 Obama has conceded that big Republican gains in Tuesday's
elections undermined prospects for comprehensive legislation to
tackle climate change.
 ""We're very disappointed about the United States going that
way and dropping climate legislation,"" said Jos Delbeke,
director general of the European Commission's climate team.
 ""We see the U.S. disappearing as a partner in achieving
meaningful climate action,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
 Obama's election in 2008 and his talk of saving a ""planet in
peril"" briefly encouraged some countries to anticipate
significant progress in talks on a new U.N. treaty to slow
rising emissions of greenhouse gases.
 The U.S. election results have dented the few remaining
expectations for a significant result at the next climate talks
in Cancun, Mexico, from Nov. 29-Dec. 10.
 Obama said at last December's Copenhagen summit that he
wanted to cut U.S. emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by
2020, a cut passed by the U.S. House of Representatives but not
by the Senate.
 ""We wonder how they can achieve their 2005 commitments
without going for a cap and trade scheme,"" said Delbeke. ""It
will make it even more problematic for international climate
negotiations.""
 Cap and trade schemes cap carbon emissions by power plants
and factories by issuing a fixed quota of emissions permits
which companies can trade among themselves.
 The U.S. reluctance to curb planet-warming emissions may
also hit plans to raise a promised $100 billion a year by 2020
to help poor nations cope with climate change.
 That plan partly hinges on curbs on emissions to push up the
price of carbon in mechanisms such as the EU's Emissions Trading
Scheme.
 But Delbeke remained upbeat that the Cancun talks could
achieve something.
 ""Cancun can still deliver, for example decisions on
adaptation and deforestation, while progress should be made on
the monitoring, reporting and verification question, but beyond
that, the outlook is worrying.""
 
 BORDER TARIFFS
 If countries such as the United States continue to avoid
climate cuts, while the EU keeps making its industry pay for
permits to emit carbon dioxide, trade imbalances will start to
occur. Some EU companies are already calling for border tariffs
to be slapped on imports to restore the balance.
 ""In the long term that may be a possibility,"" Delbeke told
reporters at a briefing earlier in the day.
 ""If we live in a world where the EU is the only one that has
made a commitment and the U.S. is doing nothing, and other
countries including China are doing nothing, then we would have
a problem and I see this debate coming up. So far we have been
holding back,"" he said.
 ""If China were to implement a cap and trade system that
would be extremely helpful to help prevent such trade mechanisms
coming into place.""

683,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2010 10:40AM ET</span>","GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Goodbye QE and elections, hello G20"," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Two down and one to go. Having
navigated past QE2 and the U.S. mid-term elections, investors
have another biggie in the coming week -- a Group of 20 summit
meeting that threatens a global clash of currencies.
 The result could have broad implications for the flow of
money into emerging markets and the returns on current holdings.
 Not that, from a risk standpoint, you could tell in the
aftermath of the Federal Reserve's decision to spend $600
billion in a quantitative easing (QE) asset-buying programme.
 The Fed managed the neat trick of beating expectations but
not in a way that spooked the markets by implying that the U.S.
economy was in a worse state than feared.
 So it was risk on, with MSCI's all-country world stock index
rising to levels last seen before Lehman Brothers collapsed,
the seminal September 2008 event that turned a bear market into
a rout.
 Emerging market debt spreads against U.S. Treasuries shrank
to their narrowest in three years.
 The prospect of massive dollar-printing to fund the Fed
programme, however, hit the dollar. The week's losses took the
U.S. currency's depreciation against other majors to nearly 15
percent since June, when global fears about euro zone sovereign
debt began to ease.
 Which brings us back to the coming week's G20 summit in
South Korea, where currency disagreements are likely to dominate
and the pre-meeting rhetoric has been far from diplomatic.
 At its simplest, the row involves Washington accusing
Beijing of keeping the yuan low, versus a lot of other countries
angry about what they see as deliberate dollar devaluation
risking their export growth and fuelling domestic inflation.
 Jeremy Armitage, global head of research at State Street
Global Markets, said the immediate risk for investors might be
for some emerging market economies to increase barriers to
investment flows to cool their currencies.
 ""I would expect to see more calls for capital controls,"" he
said.
 Longer-term, however, the fear is that the row will prompt a
protectionist trade war, which would have wide, negative
implications for many global investments.
 In a joint report to the G20, the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development and U.N trade body UNCTAD warned
that tensions over current account imbalances could slow
investment or degenerate into a protectionist spiral.
 ""Capital controls and regulations to buffer ... economies
from foreign exchange volatility and capital flows ... could
lead to a fragmentation of international capital markets along
national lines, and may be difficult to dismantle once in
place,"" they said.
 END-OF-YEAR RALLY
 Whether any of this currency stress is enough to derail what
is shaping up to be a big end-of-year risk rally remains to be
seen. Heading into the new week, there is little evidence to
suggest anything more than the odd daily adjustment is coming.
 There are underlying supports for the rally behind QE.
 MSCI's all-country index, for example, may have risen nearly
32 percent last year and be en route for 10 percent this year,
but some still think stocks are cheap.
 Thomson Reuters Datastream shows one-year forward
price-to-earnings at 12.2 times versus a 10-year average of 15.
 In a similar vein, Reuters asset allocation polls showed
that even though investors had moved into equities compared with
earlier months, they still had a lot of cash to pour in.
 In addition to this, global manufacturing activity has
accelerated for the first time in six months, creating a
situation in which an already improving world economy has been
given a sharp monetary stimulus.
 U.S. jobs data added to the mix on Friday with a
better-than-expected rise in non-farm payrolls, the first
increase since May.
 All this has left a lot of investors relatively bullish. Max
King, strategist and multi-asset portfolio manager at Investec
Asset Management, for example, sees three reasons why the end of
the equity rally is not nigh: 
 -- too much money has been flooding into bonds;
 -- value, earnings, sentiment and issuance make equities a
long-term buying opportunity; and
 -- economic growth could turn out better than expected.
 Even investors who withdrew from the market to avoid
volatility around the QE decision have a longer-term faith.
 ""Global equities are priced to deliver attractive returns,""
wealth managers at Ashburton said in a recent briefing.
 
 EURO ZONE STRESS
 There are always risks, of course, and the kind of debt
stress that sent global markets into conniptions earlier this
year has raised its head again.
 Borrowing costs in the euro zone's weaker economies rose
sharply in the past week with Ireland's troubles particularly in
focus. Plans to cut spending and raise tax totalling 6 billion
euros in 2011 were seen as ""unrealistic"" by some market players.
 There was a bit of a spill over into others such as Spain
and Italy, but the impact has mostly been contained.
 The issue may have become more localised as a result of
international support mechanisms.
 But the risk is there, so maybe it is two down, two to go.

 * President faces Republican threat to stall his agenda
 (Adds quotes and details)
 By Matt Spetalnick
 WASHINGTON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama,
still smarting from his Democrats' big losses in congressional
elections, said on Friday the United States cannot afford to
get mired in legislative gridlock for the next two years while
countries like China forge ahead.
 Three days after voters punished Obama's party for the weak
economy, he called for ""putting politics aside"" as he struck a
conciliatory tone with victorious Republicans, saying he was
open to hearing their ideas for tackling stubbornly high
unemployment.
 Obama now faces a threat by Republican leaders to try to
roll back his signature policies, including a healthcare
overhaul and Wall Street reform, and to block his agenda for
the rest of his term.
 ""We can't spend the next two years mired in gridlock. Other
countries like China aren't standing still so we can't stand
still either. We've got to move forward,"" Obama told reporters before
departing on a 10-day Asia tour.
 Voters unhappy with the sluggish economy delivered a
stinging rebuke to Obama and his Democrats in Tuesday's
congressional elections, handing Republicans control of the
House of Representatives and trimming the Democratic majority
in the Senate.
 Obama spoke after the government reported a
bigger-than-expected increase in employment in October but not
enough to budge the 9.6 percent jobless rate.
 He called the latest unemployment figures ""encouraging
news"" but said there was still much more work to be done to
boost jobs, and he urged Republicans to work with him. But he
gave no sign of ceding ground on any specific issues.
 ""I am open to any idea, any proposal, any way we can get
the economy growing faster so that people who need work can
find it faster,"" Obama said.
 OBAMA PUSHES PROPOSALS
 Obama pushed for progress on several of his proposals that
have faced resistance from Republicans, including tax breaks to
encourage businesses to purchase new equipment and to invest in
research and development and extending unemployment benefits.
 He also repeated his call for making permanent the
middle-class tax cuts. The White House signaled on Thursday it
was willing to negotiate with Republicans on extending expiring
Bush-era tax cuts but Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell took a
hard line against compromises with Obama.
 Obama has invited top leaders from both parties to a meeting and
a dinner at the White House on Nov. 18.
 Turning to his Asia trip, Obama said: ""I'm looking very
much forward to helping to pry some markets open, help American
businesses, and put people back to work here at home during the
course of this trip.""
 He has set a goal of doubling U.S. exports in the next five
years.
 ""This is a reminder as well that the most important
competition that we face ... will not be Democrats and
Republicans,"" he said, citing foreign competition.
 ""Our future depends on putting politics
aside to solve problems, to worry about the next generation instead
of the next election.""

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The dollar rallied on Friday
after an unexpectedly strong U.S. nonfarm payrolls report
suggested the economy may well be on a stable road to
recovery.
 The U.S. data came two days after the Federal Reserve
committed to inject $600 billion to boost a flagging economy
and gave the greenback temporary relief from a broad sell-off.
 Some investors, however, remained unconvinced that the
employment numbers were sufficient to turn the dollar's
fortunes around.
 Data on Friday showed that the U.S. economy added 151,000
jobs in October, blowing out expectations for a 60,000 rise and
the fastest pace of hiring since April 2010. For more see
[ID:nN04265378].
 ""I don't want to draw over-hasty conclusions because I
think it all depends on how sustainable these gains are,"" said
Fabian Eliasson, vice president of currency sales at Mizuho
Corporate Bank in New York.
 ""I want to see several months of these kind of numbers ...
but the dollar is strengthening nicely and we could see a
little bit of a reversal from recent dollar selling heading
into the weekend.""
 In early trading the euro fell to session lows at $1.4032
, according to EBS data. It last traded down 0.8
percent at $1.4078, retreating from a 9-1/2-month high of
$1.4283 reached the previous day.
 Market participants had been selling the euro anyway as
concerns over Ireland's austerity budget prompted a widening in
peripheral euro zone bond spreads. The premium investors demand
to hold 10-year Irish government bonds rather than German
benchmarks rose to a euro lifetime high after Dublin proposed a
budget some traders said was 'unrealistic'. [ID:nLDE6A40HF]
 Ireland is planning to push through spending cuts and tax
hikes worth six billion euros next year, the toughest budget in
its history, in a last-ditch effort to convince investors it is
not on the verge of a financial meltdown. [ID:nLDE6A3168]
 Traders said stop-losses in the euro were hit all the way
down while a surprise drop in German manufacturing orders also
dented euro sentiment. [ID:nLDE6A40WR]
 Some strategists believe, however, that even with sovereign
debt concerns in the euro zone and a strong U.S. payrolls
report, the euro's support levels against the dollar would not
be challenged.
 ""The risk trade looks like it is being partially expressed
through short euro/Australian dollar,"" said Alan Ruskin, global
head of currency strategy at Deutsche Bank.
 ""The data response is the clearest sign yet that traders
are looking to use the euro as well as the dollar as a funder
for risk trades.""
 The dollar rose 0.5 percent against the yen to 81.13
, not far from session highs at 81.48. Traders cited
talk of huge stop-loss buy orders above 82.00. On previous runs
to that level, the currency pair had faced heavy selling from
Japanese corporates and U.S. institutional funds.
 The Bank of Japan earlier concluded a policy review without
easing further. The yen firmed slightly after the announcement
on disappointment that the bank had not unveiled any expansion
of its asset buying plan in response to that of the Fed.
 The dollar was up around 0.7 percent versus a currency

 NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose while the

increased more than expected in October in a fresh sign that
the sluggish U.S. economy remains in a moderate recovery.
 The U.S. dollar rose against the euro and yen after the

last month and private companies hired workers at the fastest
pace since April. For more details, click [ID:nN04265378]

according to a Reuters poll. The unemployment rate remained
unchanged from the previous month at 9.6 percent.
 ""It's a lot stronger than people were anticipating,"" Nigel
Gault, chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington,

690,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2010 09:00AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Austerity measures around the euro zone," Nov 5 (Reuters) - Here are details of some austerity
measures around the euro zone:
 * IRELAND:
 -- The Irish government side-stepped questions on Friday
about when it will unveil a four-year austerity plan.
-- It said on Thursday it would push through spending cuts
and tax hikes totalling 6 billion euros in 2011 to get its
budget deficit under control by a deadline of 2014.
 -- Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said he expected next
year's adjustment, which will be weighed more on the spending
side, would cut the deficit to 9.25-9.5 percent of GDP in 2011
and to 2.75-3 percent of GDP in 2014, the deadline he has agreed
with Brussels to get the shortfall under control.
 -- The budget deficit is set to blow out to 32 percent of
GDP in 2010 due to the one-off inclusion of a mammoth bill for
bailing out Ireland's banks. Excluding the bank bill, the
deficit will be nearly 12 percent of GDP this year.
-- Fitch cut Ireland's credit rating last month and consumer
morale slumped as the cost of cleaning up its banks hit home,
piling pressure on the government to bring forward the 2011
budget, the toughest on record, due on Dec 7.
 * PORTUGAL:
 -- Portugal's parliament on Nov. 3 approved the general
guidelines of the budget bill, clearing another hurdle for a
fiscal programme that aims to sharply cut the deficit.
 -- Portugal has promised to cut this year's budget deficit
to 7.3 percent of gross domestic product from 9.3 percent last
year and further reduce it to 4.6 percent in 2011.
 Here are some of the measures:
 -- Cuts of 5 percent in civil servant wages and increases in
taxes in an effort to save 5.1 billion euros ($6.93 billion)
next year.
 -- On the revenue side, the measures would add 1.7 billion
euros to state coffers, or one percentage point of gross
domestic product. They include:
 -- Value-added tax to be raised by 2 percentage points for
top level to 23 percent from 21 percent, expands on a 1
percentage point increase on all levels implemented in July.
 * GREECE:
 -- Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said this month he
was not bluffing about the possibility of calling snap elections
and needed support for policies meant to bring Greece's deficit
to under 3 percent of GDP by 2014 from over 15 percent in 2009.
 -- Greece unveiled its latest austerity budget on Oct. 4.
The budget targeted a deficit of 7.0 percent of gdp in 2011,
from a projected 7.8 percent in 2010 and below an initial 8.1
percent target under a baseline IMF/EU scenario.
 -- Greek lawmakers have already approved a pension reform
bill which raises the retirement age and curbs early pensions, a
key element of an EU/IMF bailout aimed at pulling the country
out of a debt crisis. For more details, click on [ID:nLDE65N0KS]
 -- Public sector wages were cut by an average 15 percent in
2010 and will be frozen until 2014. Private sector wages were
frozen for this year and will rise in line with euro area
inflation in 2011 and 2012.
 -- The main VAT rate was increased by 4 percentage points to
23 percent.
 * SPAIN:
 -- Spain revealed full details of its 2011 budget on Oct. 7
before parliament, including its estimates for bond issuance in
2011. Announced measures include:
 -- Public spending, excluding autonomous regions, to be cut
by 7.9 percent to 122 billion euros ($165.7 billion) in 2011.
 -- Income tax rate on those earning more than 120,000 euros
rises up to 22.5 pct from 21.5 pct. Government hopes to raise
170-200 mln euros from tax hike on high earners.
 -- Forecasts additional 1.2 billion euros savings from
regional and local governments.
 * FRANCE:
 -- The budget aims to cut the public deficit to 6 percent of
gross domestic product in 2011 from 7.7 percent in 2010, in the
first phase of a plan to trim the shortfall to the EU's 3
percent ceiling in 2013, and 2 percent in 2014.
 -- France finally passed its planned rise in the retirement
age to 62 from 60 by 2018, making people work longer for a full
pension and raised public sector contributions to private sector
levels. The reform will also raise the age to receive a full
pension to 67 from 65.
 -- Raising the top marginal rate of tax to 41 percent from
40 percent to fund pension reforms.
 -- Raising the tax on capital gains by one percentage point.
 -- The end of a one-off corporate tax break in 2010 will
increase revenues by 5.3 billion euros.
 -- The government aims to raise some 400 million euros from
the sale of property in 2011.
 -- The end of fiscal stimulus measures will cut 8.2 billion
euros from the deficit.
 * ITALY:
 -- Although Italy kept its budget deficit down to 5.3
percent of GDP in 2009, well below the EU average, the budget
aims to cut the deficit to 2.7 percent by 2012.
 -- Delaying retirement dates by three to six months, a state
salary freeze and pay cuts for high public sector earners.
 -- Regional and local governments will be pressed to
contribute some 13 billion euros of spending cuts in 2011-2012.
 -- There will be a 10 percent cut per year in 2011 and 2012
in spending by all government ministries.
 * GERMANY:
 -- Chancellor Angela Merkel said her government aims to save
around 80 billion euros between 2011 and 2014 and get the German
budget deficit below European Union limits by 2013. The cabinet
backed a bill covering the bulk of the 80 billion euro ($101
programme over the next four years on Sept 1.
 -- The budget, due before parliament by end of November,
will cut spending to 307.4 billion euros in 2011, a 3.8 percent
decrease from 2010, and reduce the deficit to 60 billion.

 VIENNA, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The euro has not become a victim
in the wake of the U.S. central bank's decision to pump fresh
stimulus into the economy, European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said on Friday.
 ""The euro is certainly not a victim,"" Nowotny, who also

asked if the euro was a victim of the Federal Reserve's decision
this week to spend another $600 billion to boost the economy.

 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said on Thursday he did
not think the United States was actively trying to weaken the
dollar by printing money, despite criticism from emerging
economic powerhouses.
 Nowotny added that the ECB had no foreign exchange targets
and that it had to live with currency market moves.
 ""What we want to avoid is abrupt currency moves but
altogether we have to accept what comes from the markets,"" he
said, stressing the ECB's goal was instead price stability.
 Nowotny also said he did not expect to see a major plunge in
economic growth in the euro zone next year. ""We believe that
growth rates in 2011 will be somewhat lower than in 2010 but not
a lot lower,"" he said.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Friday as
concerns over Ireland's austerity budget prompted a widening in
peripheral euro zone bond spreads, in turn allowing the dollar
some respite from a run of heavy losses.
 The premium investors demand to hold 10-year Irish
government bonds rather than German benchmarks rose to a euro
lifetime high after Dublin proposed a budget some traders said
was ""unrealistic"".
 Ireland is planning to push through spending cuts and tax
hikes worth 6 billion euros next year, the toughest budget in
its history, in a last-ditch effort to convince investors it is
not on the verge of financial meltdown.
 ""The euro is down as real-money accounts are starting to
take a negative view on the euro zone periphery and the
potential impact that any restructure would have on European
banks,"" said Stephen Gallo, head of market analysis at Schneider
Foreign Exchange.
 European Central Bank Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini
Smaghi said on Monday the issue of a country being in a position
where it cannot repay debt could not be excluded.
 Gallo said that with the Federal Reserve's announcement on
further quantitative easing measures out of the way the market
was again focusing on the euro zone's structural problems.
 The euro was down 0.7 percent at $1.4097 versus the dollar,
retreating from a 9 1/2-month high of $1.4283 reached the
previous day.
 Traders said stop-losses were being hit all the way down,
while a surprise drop in German manufacturing orders also dented
euro sentiment.
 The dollar was up around 0.5 percent versus a currency
basket at 76.235, bouncing from an 11-month low touched on
Thursday of 75.631 when investors took the Federal Reserve's
decision to implement fresh QE on Wednesday as a reason to dump
the greenback.
 The focus turned to U.S. monthly jobs data, with a weaker
number having the potential to reignite dollar selling.
 ""The Fed has made it clear that quantitative easing will
remain in place and there is enough slackness in the U.S.
economy. So any strong number is unlikely to offer much support
to the dollar,"" said Ian Stannard, senior currency strategist at
BNP Paribas.
 Economists polled by Reuters expect 60,000 jobs were created
in October after 95,000 were lost in September. That is seen as
too feeble a signal to imply any meaningful shift in the
stagnant labour market. As a result the unemployment rate is
expected to remain sticky at 9.6 percent..
 The Australian dollar fell 0.4 percent to $1.0094, having
risen to a 28-year high of $1.0183 earlier after a robust
quarterly bulletin from the Reserve Bank of Australia.
 That contrasted with the Fed's commitment to buy more
Treasuries, implying ultra-loose monetary policy, which renewed
the focus on the dollar as a funding currency for purchases in
commodities, emerging markets and higher-yielding currencies.
 The dollar was flat against the yen, at 80.85 yen after the
Bank of Japan (BOJ) concluded a policy review without easing
further. The yen firmed slightly after the announcement on
disappointment that the bank had not unveiled any expansion of
its asset buying plan in response to the Fed.

 * Greece, Ireland, Portugal in focus so far

 By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent
 LONDON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - On the Eurozone's troubled fringe,
governments bluntly offer voters, MPs and oppositions a stark
choice -- either back us or face early elections, political
collapse and a financial market rout.
 That leaves investors facing the threat of periodic
political crises across any or all of the group insultingly
dubbed the PIIGS -- Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain
-- that could push out bond yields and the euro .
 ""Obviously, from a political point of view it makes sense to
dare the opposition or electorate to bring you down -- and hope
they won't because the alternative is too horrible,"" said David
Lea, Western Europe analyst for Control Risks.
 ""But it's always going to worry investors.""
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou is making what
analysts say is a risky play for support in upcoming local
polls, threatening to call early general elections if voters
punish ruling Socialists heavily in Nov 7 and 14 local votes.
 In Ireland, the government will use every political trick in
its armoury to make sure that 2011 budget sneaks through in
December despite its coalition majority likely falling to just
two after an upcoming by-election.

 Portugal's government cleared most of its budget hurdles
winning a vote on general guidelines on Wednesday, with the
centre-right opposition social democrats agreeing to abstain.
But the party's parliamentary leader warned it would still
scrutinise the bill carefully before a final vote on Nov 26.
 All three governments hope to be able to use the threat of
swift and damaging investor flight to push through tough
reforms. No one, they hope, will be willing to spark a crisis
that could drive a country to the brink of bankruptcy or beyond.
 But some of the votes are far from foregone conclusions and
markets have been spooked anyway. The worry has helped to push
the spread between Irish and German bonds out to record levels.
Greek-German debt spreads have also risen sharply.
 Weakened, battered and unpopular as many governments are in
the Eurozone's most indebted states, analysts say new elections
in particular could make things worse.
 
 RISKING A ""MEDITERRANEAN BELGIUM""
 ""If there was an election in almost any one of those
countries, I wouldn't bet on an outright opposition victory,""
Lea said. ""You could end up with a Mediterranean Belgium -- and
that wouldn't be good for anybody.""
 Belgium has been without a government since parliamentary
elections in June, slightly unnerving investors who want to see
it also rein in its budget deficit.
 But it has been under much less immediate market pressure
than the PIIGS.
 There are clear differences between the countries.
Portugal's centre-left Socialist party survived its election
last year, but lost its ruling majority.
 Greece's Socialists were only elected late last year,
leaving them in part able to blame their predecessors for
Greece's financial misfortunes and resulting need for austerity.
 Ireland's ruling Fianna Fail has no such luxury. In power
since 1997, opinion polls suggest it will be swept from power
when elections are finally held next year.
 The prospect of an orderly Irish election and transition of
power leaves markets largely unfazed -- the key 2011 budget
would already have passed and all three major parties are
committed to deficit reduction. But a budget vote failure,
government collapse and policy hiatus in the run-up to
unexpectedly early polls would be a different matter.
 Still, most analysts expect the government to survive -- in
part because the opposition Fianna Gael might well prefer the
current government to take the political hit for new austerity. 
 While political tensions in those three countries look set
to continue to affect asset prices -- particularly government
bonds -- in the coming months, some believe the real danger
comes the following year.
 
 ITALY, SPAIN NEXT?
 ""The politics look bad in Portugal, Greece and Ireland right
now but this is mainly posturing and noise,"" said Ian Bremmer.
""In a macro European terms, these three countries are small and
containable in the event of a crisis. The two that pose systemic
risk are Spain and Italy. Both are fine for now but 2011 could
be very turbulent.""
 Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero cleared
a major hurdle bypassing the 2011 budget with support from the
Basque National Party, avoiding the threat of a no-confidence
vote and early elections.
 Tensions may rise again next year in the run-up to polls in
2012, although again some suspect the opposition would rather
avoid forcing early elections and leave austerity to Zapatero.
 Italy has largely avoided the kind of market pressure so far
inflicted on other fringe Eurozone borrowers, and hope its
austerity package will help avoid similar crises.
 But that too could change particularly if a lingering
stand-off between Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and key
former ally Gianfranco Fini erupts once more, perhaps bringing
early elections next year.
 For now, both Italy and Spain remain under much less
pressure than the PIIGS, with the spread between Italian and
German 10 year bonds around 165 basis points and Spanish-German
spreads 205, compared to 550 for Ireland and 900 for Greece.
 But most analysts expect all to be buffeted by political
stories in the year to come.
 ""In terms of the Eurozone, it looks like the Greek story
will always be with us and the spotlight will move around the
other troubled countries,"" said Control Risks' Lea. ""Last week
was Portugal, this week Ireland. Next week, who knows?""

 * Euro zone peripherals' borrowing costs up on Ireland
 * Dollar recovers from an 11-month low
 * European banks struggle
 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - World stocks on Friday pulled back
from a two-year high reached after the Fed's stimulus package,
with investors cautious ahead of U.S. jobs data and on concerns
over Ireland's budget, while the dollar recovered from an
11-month low.
 Borrowing costs in euro zone's weaker economies rose sharply
after some traders said Ireland's budget to cut spending and
raise tax totalling 6 billion euros next year was ""unrealistic"".
 Irish stocks also fell sharply, with the country's benchmark
down 1.8 percent and Bank of Ireland shares falling more than
11 percent.
 ""This is concerning, the spread of contagion to Spain and
Italy given their structural significance in the euro zone and
potential for broader financial shock,"" said Lena Komileva, head
of G7 market economics at Tullet Prebon.
 Banks were the top stocks losers in Europe, down 1.1
percent, while Wall Street looked set for a softer opening.
 Spanish and Italian bond spreads over equivalent 10-year
German Bunds were around five basis points wider, while the
Irish/German 10-year yield spread hit a new high at 553 bps.
 The cost of protection against Irish credit default rose 28
bps to 610 bps to a record high.
 The Thomson Reuters Peripheral Eurozone Countries Index
fell 2.5 percent, while the Spanish share benchmark lost 2
percent.
 Event risk remains high for the periphery with the Greek
Prime Minister threatening to call early general elections if
disgruntled voters do not back his austerity plans in local
elections this weekend and with Portugal planning to issue up to
1.5 billion euros of bonds next week.
 The Federal Reserve's decision on Wednesday to spend $600
billion buying longer-term Treasury bonds to reflate the
flagging economy has helped boost risk appetite, with investors
piling into emerging market assets and commodities in search of
higher returns. The dollar, on the other, has suffered.
 Investor focus now turns to the U.S. monthly jobs data, due
at 1230 GMT, and traders said any upside surprise from the
numbers is likely to offer only a fleeting respite to the
greenback. A weaker number could see the dollar-selling trend
gather pace.
""The Fed has made it clear that quantitative easing will
remain in place and there is enough slackness in the U.S.
economy. So any strong number is unlikely to offer much support
to the dollar,"" said Ian Stannard, senior currency strategist at
BNP Paribas.
 Economists polled by Reuters expect 60,000 jobs were created
last month after 95,000 were lost in September, with jobless
rate seen static at 9.6 percent month-on-month.

 * U.S. bond buying, deficit spending ""clueless"" 
 * EU, G20, G11 must coordinate economic policy

 By Brian Rohan and Annika Breidthardt
 BERLIN, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Europe needs to strengthen
economic governance and agree on a permanent crisis resolution
mechanism, all the more so given current U.S. economic weakness,
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Friday.
 Speaking at a conference in Berlin, Schaeuble took issue
with the European Central Bank's reluctance to support both a
permanent structure to prevent future economic crises and
strengthen the European Union's budget rules.
 ""I am of the opinion, and I know (ECB President Jean-Claude)
Trichet doesn't agree with me, we in Europe cannot do without a
crisis management mechanism on top of a strengthened stability
and growth pact,"" Schaeuble said.
 Replacement of the current mechanism, set up in the wake of
the Greek debt crisis to prevent it from spreading and to help
stabilise the euro currency, was on track and would likely not
disturb financial markets, he argued.
 ""I believe we are on track to developing a reasonable
mechanism in the EU ... Market participants have long
anticipated and are expecting it, Schaeuble said.
 Germany has pushed for a replacement of the programme, which
expires in 2013, and increased economic coordination in the EU
-- a goal advanced last month when plans it put forward with
France to make limited changes to the bloc's treaty and tighten
budgetary rules gained approval.
 France and Germany should maintain their leadership role in
Europe, Schaeuble said, especially in order to harmonise its
economic policy and bolster stability given current economic
uncertainties.
 These are being worsened by reckless policy in part from the
the United States, Schaeuble said, sharpening his criticism of
the Federal Reserve's programme to buy an additional $600
billion worth of U.S. government bonds.
 Pumping more money into the economy will not solve the
country's problems, he said, adding that the world needed U.S.
leadership that was currently lacking. 
 ""With all due respect, U.S. policy is clueless,"" Schaeuble
said. ""(The problem) is not a shortage of liquidity. It's not
that the Americans haven't pumped enough liquidity into the
market.""
 Late on Thursday, Schaeuble said Germany would take up this
point critically with the United States both bilaterally and at
next week's G20 summit of industrialised and emerging nations.
[ID:nLDE6A32NJ]
 Aside from the G20, international economic coordination
could prove nimbler in a smaller framework, Schaeuble said.
 ""The G11, a combination of the G7 (industrialised) and BRIC
countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) could become an
instrument with which we gain capability to act.""

 (Adds fresh quote, background)
 PARIS, Nov 5 (Reuters) - China will keep up its exports of
rare earths next year, Trade Minister Chen Deming said on
Friday, adding that trade in the highly sought minerals should
not be made into a political issue.
 China dominates the production of rare elements used in
high-tech devices, batteries and wind turbines, and keeps strict
controls on their trade, despite pressure from the United States
and Japan to loosen export constraints.
 A Chinese decision to slash rare earth export quotas
generally has pushed up prices and raised concerns in the West
that it could use its supply dominance as a political lever.
 ""The rare earth issue should not be made political. China
will maintain its existing rare earth exports next year,"" Chen,
in Paris accompanying President Hu Jintao's official visit, told
reporters.
 China produces about 90 percent of the world's output of
rare earths, used in lasers, superconductors, computers and
other electronics.
 Chen said a drop in Chinese rare earth production in recent
years was due to measures taken to protect the environment, and
rather than criticise China the world should look at
alternatives to the minerals, which are a limited resource.
 ""Today China is paying more attention to environmental
protection,"" Chen said. ""Our action is based on environmental
concerns, it is not economic or commercial, it is not
political.""
 ""We are currently in talks with rare earth consuming
countries and coutries with rich rare resources on how to
produce rare earth in a more environmentally friendly way and
put pressure on countries with richer rare earth resources to
start producing,"" Chen said. ""We also need to find new rare
earth resources.""

 LONDON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The dollar was mired near 11-month
lows against a basket of currencies on Friday, while the
Australian dollar hit 28-year highs as the Federal Reserve's
stimulus package spurred investors appetite for risk.
 Investor focus now turns to U.S. monthly jobs data and
traders said any upside surprise from the numbers is likely to
offer only a fleeting respite to the dollar. A weaker number
could see the dollar-selling trend gather pace.
 ""The Fed has made it clear that quantitative easing will
remain in place and there is enough slackness in the U.S.
economy. So any strong number is unlikely to offer much support
to the dollar,"" said Ian Stannard, senior currency strategist at
BNP Paribas.
 Economists polled by Reuters expect 60,000 jobs were created
in October after 95,000 were lost in September. That is seen as
too feeble a signal to imply any meaningful shift in the
stagnant labour market. As a result the unemployment rate is
expected to remain sticky at 9.6 percent. [ID:nN02101041].
 The dollar index <=USD><.DXY> was flat at 75.90, having hit
an 11-month low of 75.63 on Thursday and opening the way for a
possible test of its 2009 low of 74.17.
 The euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.4222 , not far from
$1.4283, its strongest since late January, struck on Thursday.
Traders reported options barriers at $1.43.
 The Australian dollar was up 0.3 percent at $1.0173
, having risen to a 28-year high of $1.0183 earlier in
the session. Apart from buoyant risk appetite, the Aussie was
supported by upbeat comments from the central bank on Friday.
[ID:nSGE6A4018].
 Australia's central bank raised rates by 25 basis points
this week to 4.75 percent, amongst the highest in the developed
world.
 That was in sharp contrast to the Fed's commitment this week
to buy more Treasuries, implying ultra-loose monetary policy.
That has renewed the focus on the dollar as a funding currency
for purchases in commodities, emerging markets and
higher-yielding currencies.
 Highlighting the risk-on sentiment, share markets around
Asia and Europe extended gains on Friday.

 BOJ UNMOVED SO FAR
 The dollar was flat against the yen, at 80.70 yen, paring
small early gains, and edging closer to its 1995 post-war record
low of 79.75 yen . Traders said Japanese exporters lined
up with offers at 80.80-81 yen levels.
 The Bank of Japan (BOJ) concluded a policy review without
easing policy further. The yen firmed slightly after the
announcement on disappointment that the bank had not announced
any expansion to its asset buying plan in response to the Fed.
 BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said on Friday he saw upside
and downside risks to Japan's economy as evenly balanced.
[ID:nTOE6A4080].
 Analysts expect some weakening in Japan's economic
indicators ahead and say more easing through asset-buying will
be needed.
 ""Yen strength feels as if it is coming home to roost,"" said
Robert Rennie, chief strategist at Westpac in Sydney. ""Now is
the time for the BOJ to start to stand up and deliver.""
 On the crosses, the yen lost ground this week against the
euro and the Aussie dollar, falling to its lowest since May at
82.15 yen per Australian dollar  on Thursday.
 A fall in yen option volatilities has helped boost the
crosses, as it encourages carry trades by suggesting less risk
of currency market swings, a trader at a European bank said.
 One-month dollar/yen  option volatility has fallen
after the Fed decision but it still remains above the levels
seen earlier in the decade, the trader noted.
 The latest rise in cross yen pairs was more likely a
knee-jerk reaction to falling volatilities than a real increase
in carry trade flows, he added.

(adds quotes, background)
 By Aileen Wang and Simon Rabinovitch
 BEIJING, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve's launch
of more quantitative easing is understandable, but the decision
may pose problems for the global economy and illustrates why the
international monetary system must be reformed, China's central
bank governor said on Friday.
 Zhou Xiaochuan, head of the People's Bank of China, made
waves last year in suggesting that the Special Drawing Right, the
IMF's unit of account, should eventually displace the dollar as a
global reserve currency.
 He revisited the central element of his argument in a speech
on Friday, saying that there was an intrinsic conflict in the way
the United States manages its economy.
 ""We can understand the Fed's QE2 policy, from the angle that
it wants to revive the U.S. economy and increase employment. But
the problem is the dollar is the global reserve currency,"" he
told a forum.
 ""It may not be the right choice for the global economy,
though it is a good option for the U.S. economy,"" he said.
 Rather than just criticising the Fed, Zhou said that thought
should be given to more fundamental reform.
 ""If we oppose this policy, we probably need to rethink
problems in the international monetary system, how to improve the
system when the U.S. domestic role and global role conflict with
each other.""
 In an essay last year, Zhou said that reserve
currency-issuing countries would get tripped up by the so-called
Triffin Dilemma -- the idea that they cannot issue enough money
to satisfy the global appetite for reserves without eventually
depreciating their own currency.
 In the near term, economists have warned that large-scale
monetary easing in the United States could push a wave of
liquidity into global markets that will threaten fast-growing
developing economies with speculative inflows and asset bubbles.
 WARDING OFF INFLOWS
 The World Bank said this week that China was in a better
position than most to resist such inflows, and Zhou concurred.
 ""As for whether hot money will come into China, I think that
our existing foreign exchange controls are able to ward off
irregular capital inflows,"" he said.
 Turning to China's own economic policies, which themselves
have been the subject of fierce global criticism, Zhou defended
the county's approach to reform.
 China wants to reduce its whopping trade surplus, but will
not rely on its exchange rate policy alone to do so, he said.
 ""We have different medicines. Exchange rate policy is only
one of them. China does not want to emphasise only one single
medicine,"" he said.
 Zhou said that China had decided to largely give up one kind
of medicine: tax breaks for exporters.
 ""We are not using as many export tax rebates as before,
because we saw that their side-effect was to trigger trade
frictions,"" he said.
 China has pledged to reform its exchange rate to make it more
flexible, but other countries, especially the United States, say
that it deliberately keeps its currency undervalued to give its
exporters an unfair advantage.
 Beijing has let the yuan rise about 2.5 percent since
depegging it from the dollar in June.

707,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2010 03:20AM ET</span>",NEWSMAKER-Feisty minister gives teeth to India's green laws," By Krittivas Mukherjee
 NEW DELHI, Nov 5 (Reuters) - To some, he is an
environmental crusader, and to others he is the ""Dr. No"" of
development.
 But everyone agrees India's environment minister Jairam
Ramesh is setting new standards in compliance that often bring
him in conflict with industry.
 He has scrapped or delayed clearance for hundreds of
projects, including by UK-based miner Vedanta, feeding a raging
national debate about a global challenge -- finding the balance
between growth and environmental protection.
Next week, an experts' panel will give its view on whether a
$12 billion steel mill by South Korea's POSCO can be given
green clearance.
 That will set the stage for Ramesh to make a final decision
on India's biggest foreign direct investment proposal that is
being seen as a reflection of the country's investment climate.
 POSCO, the world's third-largest steelmaker, wants to build
the mill in India's eastern Orissa state but has faced delays
over environmental clearance and from protests by local
residents who stand to be affected by the plant.
Whether or not he ultimately clears POSCO's plans, Ramesh is
setting an agenda of compliance unseen in a hitherto
rubber-stamping ministry, sometimes putting him on a collision
course with cabinet colleagues backing mines, roads and
industry.
 Underlying all this is a realisation in India that
enforcing environmental rules does not have to hurt growth, can
boost the idea of rule of law and make government policies
transparent.
 The challenge is not unique to India -- developing economy
Brazil and old hand Australia are also facing these issues.
 ""Let us all accept the reality that there is undoubtedly a
trade-off between growth and environment,"" Ramesh wrote in an
article for the Economic and Political Weekly magazine.
 ""In arriving at decisions to untangle the trade-off, three
options present themselves - 'yes', 'yes, but' and 'no'"".
 Given the antipathy between the growth and environment
lobbies, Ramesh wrote, maximise the 'yes, but' where possible.
 GREEN FUNDAMENTALIST?
 Like many of his decisions, a touch of drama permeates
everything about this U.S.-educated
technocrat-turned-politician, mostly seen in a flowing Indian
white shirt rolled up at the sleeves. Outdoors, he is rarely
seen without his dark glasses.
 Once he discarded a convocation gown at a school calling
the practice of wearing it a ""barbaric colonial relic"". Another
time he picked up old toxic waste from an industrial accident
site to drive home the point the remains were not dangerous any
more.
 In most of what he does, Ramesh has the backing of his
ruling Congress party chief Sonia Gandhi, a left-leaning
centrist who can ill afford to antagonise millions of rural
voters most affected by huge mining and manufacturing
projects.
Apart from being a political issue, disaffection in the
countryside risks fanning support for Maoist rebels who want to
overthrow the Indian state - a concern Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh has termed as India's biggest internal security
challenge.
 But Ramesh's stand in a country focused on development and
raring to move to the global high table has meant he is also
scoffed at by some as an inflexible green fundamentalist.
 Apart from hundreds of industry projects, he has held up
construction of a second airport in the commercial hub of
Mumbai and dozens of road and dam projects await clearance.
 Ramesh, 56, is one of a handful of political leaders seen
able to push an agenda of modernising India against
conservative figures in the Congress who focus more on
political expediency.
 When Singh appointed him environment minister last year,
months ahead of the Copenhagen climate conference, Ramesh
created a flutter by suggesting that India could be more
flexible in its negotiating stance at the summit.
 He soon backed down, and even seemed contrite.
 ""In our country, you are not accepted if you start thinking
out of the box,"" Ramesh, a U.S.-educated former civil servant,
said after the controversy.
 ""You have to be inside the box. You can go out of the box
occasionally but be sure you return quickly.""

708,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2010 03:20AM ET</span>",Q+A-POSCO's proposed $12 bln steel mill in east India," By Krittivas Mukherjee
 NEW DELHI, Nov 5 (Reuters) - South Korea's POSCO wants to
build a $12 billion steel mill in eastern India, but the
project has faced delays because of environmental worries and
protests by local residents concerned about the mill's impact
on their agriculture-based livelihoods.
 Here are some questions and answers about the project,
which has already been delayed by three years:
 WHAT IS THE PROJECT?
 The world's third-largest steel company wants to set up a
mill in the eastern state of Orissa to produce 12 million
tonnes of steel every year. POSCO also has plans to build a 6
million tonnes-a-year plant in the southern Karnataka state and
another mill to produce 3 million tonnes a year in central
India.
 But the Orissa plant has faced problems, mainly over
clearance from the environment ministry.
 WHY IS THE PROJECT IMPORTANT?
 The plant in Orissa is billed as India's biggest foreign
direct investment, and its progress is being watched by
prospective investors as a reflection of India's investment
climate. The prime minister's office is monitoring the project,
signalling the importance the government accords it.
 The South Korean company is among several corporations,
including London-listed Vedanta Resources, whose Indian
projects have come under scrutiny by an environment ministry
that has been tightening rules.
 That has often brought it into conflict with other
government departments pushing for rapid industrialisation.
 WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF THE MILL BEING CLEARED?
 Highly likely. Optimism for the project has risen, given
its progress is being monitored by the office of pro-reform
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
 Ramesh has also said POSCO's project was ""fundamentally
different"" from Vedanta, whose mining plans were scrapped by
him along with a proposal to expand its alumina refinery.
 One of the earlier panels had also said POSCO's mill would
not displace tribespeople.
 WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS FACING THE PLANT?
 POSCO signed the agreement for the Orissa mill in 2005 and
was scheduled to begin production by end-2011, but local
protests, environmental worries and litigation over the related
mining concession have delayed the project.
 In August, India's environment ministry ordered a halt to
all work on the project, including land acquisition, while a
panel investigated if the Forest Rights Act that seeks to
protect forest land and settlers had been violated.
 That panel gave a split verdict after which Environment
Minister Jairam Ramesh asked a new expert panel to review
whether the proposed mill can be given green clearance.
 The committee's findings are not binding and the final
decision lies with Ramesh.
 POSCO faces another problem: a local firm also seeking a
concession has challenged the concession granted to the South
Koreans, and is proceeding with a legal case against the Orissa
state government.
 The decision on the mining concession lies with Supreme
Court, but the litigation is unlikely to hold back the mill's
construction once the green nod is given.

709,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2010 03:20AM ET</span>",PREVIEW-POSCO's India steel mill may get key support next week," By Krittivas Mukherjee
 NEW DELHI, Nov 5 (Reuters) - A much-delayed $12 billion
steel mill project by South Korean firm POSCO, India's biggest
foreign direct investment and a barometer of its business
climate, may receive a boost next week when an experts' panel
meets to review its environmental clearance.
 The panel meets on Nov. 9-10 to agree on a recommendation
for Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh, whose push for
ecological compliance has forced the delay, or outright
scrapping, of many big-ticket projects, including some by
London-listed miner Vedanta Resources Plc.
 The panel's advice is not binding, but the proposed plant
by POSCO, the world's third-largest steel company, is being
monitored by the office of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who
appears keen to forge strong political ties with Seoul, raising
the odds that the project will eventually be given the
go-ahead.
 Ramesh has also said the POSCO project was ""fundamentally
different"" from Vedanta's plans to expand an alumina refinery
and a mining concession, which were rejected by his ministry.
 ""Once the Experts Appraisal Committee gives me its report,
I will take a comprehensive decision,"" Ramesh told reporters
when asked about a final decision.
 POSCO wants to build the mill in eastern Orissa state, but
has faced delays arising from green clearance issues and
protests by local residents who say the plant will disrupt
their largely agriculture and forest-based livelihoods.
 A previous panel had said POSCO's mill would not displace
any tribespeople.
 The South Korean company is among several corporations,
including Vedanta, that have come under scrutiny from an
environment ministry that has been tightening rules, as opposed
to other rubber-stamping entities in the government.
 That stance has often sparked conflict with other
government departments pushing for rapid industrialisation.
 Next week's panel recommendation on POSCO will precede a
visit by Singh to South Korea, where he will attend a Group of
20 summit. But it was unlikely that Ramesh would make a final
decision before Singh's trip, government sources said.
 ""The matter is being followed at the highest level.
Something like this cannot be timed just because the prime
minister is going to a particular country which is investing in
this project,"" a government source told Reuters.
 POSCO faces another hurdle: a court case filed by a local
firm against the Orissa state government, contesting its
decision to grant a mining concession to the South Koreans, as
the company had also bid for it.
 The decision on this case lies with the Supreme Court. But
the litigation is unlikely to hold back the start of the POSCO
mill's construction if the central government approves it.
 POSCO was scheduled to begin production from its plant in
Orissa's Kujanga region by the end of 2011. The pact for the
mill was signed in June 2005 and also included captive iron ore
mining rights in the state's Khandadhar area.

"
710,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2010 02:32AM ET</span>",Business groups want G20 to press China on rare earths," By Ken Wills
 BEIJING, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Major business groups from the
United States, Japan and other rare earth consumers have urged
the G20 group of major economies to press China to end export
curbs of the metal ores.
 The demand for world leaders to address underscores how
quickly access to this niche of China's mining output has risen
as a business and political issue.
 The letter, signed by the Alliance of Automobile
Manufacturers, the Consumer Electronics Association,
BUSINESSEUROPE, Japan's Nippon Keidanren business lobby and 33
other groups urges the G20 summit in Seoul next week to make
unfettered access to rare earths ""a top priority"".
 Though the letter does not name China, it is clearly the
target as supplier of about 97 percent of the world's rare
earths, which are used in a variety of hi-tech and clean energy
industries.
 A copy of the letter was given to Reuters on Friday by a
person involved in organising it, who demanded anonymity.
 Rare earths are a range of 17 metals with magnetic,
luminescent and other properties, and China's quota reductions
and recent supply blockages, especially to Japan, have rattled
companies and governments dependent on those supplies.
 ""Rare earth elements are essential to the clean energy,
automotive, petroleum refining, chemical and electronics
industries or today and tomorrow,"" said the letter.
 ""There is a substantial and growing risk, however, that
without adequate supply and open access to such elements, global
efforts to address climate change, promote innovation, and
advance global growth will be significantly hindered.""
 U.S. President Barack Obama, Chinese President Hu Jintao and
other leaders should agree to ""refrain from export taxes, quotas
and other market-distorting measures on rare earth elements that
restrict global supply and unnecessarily contribute to price
volatility,"" says the letter, which was dated Wednesday.
 Governments should also ""renounce interference with
commercial sale of rare earth elements, domestically or
internationally,"" says the letter.
 The letter was sent to governments attending the Seoul summit
next Thursday and Friday, said the source who provided it.
 This year, Beijing slashed rare earth ore export quotas by
around 40 percent from 2009 levels, saying it needs to protect
reserves from reckless exploitation. Disruptions of shipments to
Japan, in a diplomatic row with China, have raised the prospect
of Beijing using its hold on supplies for political leverage.
 China mined about 120,000 tonnes of rare earths in 2008.
 Chinese commerce officials have said those export quotas will
be pared a little more next year.
 China holds about a third of known, exploitable global
reserves of rare earths, but it worries that its supplies will be
depleted within decades at current rates of mining.
 President Obama could take up the rare earths issue when he
meets President Hu in Seoul, the White House has said.

 BEIJING, Nov 5 (Reuters) - China on Friday gave a briefing
ahead of the G20 summit in Seoul next week. Following are the
comments of Vice Foreign Minister Cui Tiankai on a range of
economic and financial issues.
 For a story, click on: [ID:nnTOE6A403F]
 ON G20 AGENDA
 ""The G20 should revolve around common issues facing the
global economy, rather than be narrowly focused on the technical
issues of certain countries or certain areas, and still less the
specific issues facing emerging market economies.""
 ""If any issues about a specific country are to be discussed,
they should discuss the issues of the main reserve
currency-issuing country, because their policies have a big
impact on the global economy.""
 ""There are indeed many imbalances in the global economy, such
as in north-south development, the development of the
international financial system and representation in global
financial decision making. All these are structural imbalances.""
 ""So we believe a discussion on current account targets misses
the whole point.""
 ""If you look at the current global economy, there are many
issues that merit more attention -- for example, the question of
quantitative easing. In recent days, the issue has raised great
concern among all economies in the world.
 ""In addition, some major economies have implemented an
almost-zero interest rate policy for a long period, and the
impact that this will have on other countries' economic stability
is another issue of wide concern.""
 ""These are the issues that have systemic and structural
implications for the world economy, and they are worthy of our
attention.""
 CURRENT ACCOUNT TARGETS
 ""As for current account targets, of course, we hope to seem
more balanced current accounts. But we believe it would not be a
good approach to single out this issue and focus all attention on
it. The artificial setting of a numerical target cannot but
remind us of the days of planned economies.""
 ""China has carried out market-oriented reforms in its
economic system over many years, but now there are some people in
the world who want us to go back to the days of a planned
economy. This really surprises us.
 ""In addition, for both the academic and business communities,
such a target lacks a concrete basis in either theoretical or
practical terms.
 ""Therefore, we believe that it is inappropriate to discuss
such a topic at the G20. This would send the wrong message to the
world that the G20 cares about unimportant issues. That will do
no good for the world economic recovery.
 YUAN REFORM
 ""As for China's exchange rate, we have steadily moved ahead
with reform.""
 ""But if anyone or any country gives China a specific target,
requiring the yuan to appreciate to a designated level during a
given period, that would indeed be asking us to manipulate the
renminbi's exchange rate, and it is something that we will of
course not do.""
 THE FED'S QUANTITATIVE EASING
 ""They owe us some explanation.
 ""I've seen much concern about the impact of this policy on
financial stability in other countries. As the main issuer of a
reserve currency, we would hope that it (the United States)
adopts a responsible position.
 ""It is fair to say that all emerging economies and developing
countries, including China, are influenced by macro-economic
policies from the major reserve currency-issuing country, and we
certainly will keep a close eye on how these policies impact us.
 ""In economic terms, such policies will have a spillover
effect. But I am afraid, if such policies continues, the
spillover may turn into a flood. So I think the international
community has reason to be concerned.
 ""The Federal Reserve has the right to make its own decisions,
and it need not consult with any other country beforehand. And
there is no one to impose a specific target on it.
 ""But we hope they can consider the impacts on other countries
in the world when they make decisions, not just their own
economy.
 ""We are willing to have a discussion with the United States
about the impact of such a policy on the Chinese economy and the
world economy.""
 IMF REFORM
 ""We note that the recent G20 finance ministers' and central
bank governors' meeting set targets for reform. That represented
progress.
 ""The essence of IMF quota reform is to reflect more
accurately the current reality in the global economy. The
distribution of quota shares in the IMF has long lagged behind
global economic realities. This situation should be addressed as
soon as possible.
 ""It is most reasonable and sensible to increase China's quota
share in the IMF, but on this issue China does not seek to
maximise its own self-interest. Rather, we hope to see a win-win
situation for all emerging market economies and other members of
the IMF.
 ""The completion of quota reform does not signify the end of
IMF reform. Many countries have said that the quota system itself
needs to be reformed, and the IMF governance structure also needs
to be reformed. These are tasks for further IMF reform going
forward.""
 ""This is not the end, not even the beginning of the end, but
the end of the beginning.""

 By Yoko Nishikawa
 Nov 5 (Reuters) - Japan is having trouble forging a
consensus on joining an Asia-Pacific free trade initiative, a
pact that business lobbies want the government to pursue but
that long-protected and politically powerful farmers are
resisting.
 The government is set to finalise basic guidelines for
Japan's future course on free trade deals generally ahead of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit on Nov
13-14, which Japan hosts and U.S. President Barack Obama will
attend.
 Following are key facts about the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific
Partnership (TPP) and its possible impact on Japan.
 WHAT IS THE TPP?
 It would in principle eliminate all tariffs within the
zone.
 Singapore, New Zealand, Chile and Brunei agreed on a free
trade deal in 2006, and have since been joined in talks by
United States, Australia, Peru, Vietnam and Malaysia.
 There is no formal deadline for completing talks, but
supporters hope for a deal by the time that Obama hosts the
annual APEC leaders summit in Hawaii in November 2011. The
Obama administration sees TPP as a key element of its plan to
double U.S. exports over the next five years.
 For a new country to join the talks, it needs to get
approval from all the member nations. Canada, for one, has been
assessing the possibility of entering the TPP negotiation.
 WHY IS JAPAN CONSIDERING JOINING
 Japanese business lobbies worry that the nation is lagging
behind rivals such as South Korea, whose recent free trade deal
with the European Union in particular has given them the
jitters, and China, now replacing Japan as the world's
second-largest economy.
 Japan's free trade deals with 11 countries and regions
account for only 16 percent of its overall trade in value
terms, compared to 36 percent for South Korea.
 Japan's Cabinet Office estimates TPP participation would
boost real GDP by about half a percentage point annually after
taking into account the adverse impact on the farm sector.
 WHAT ARE HURDLES FOR JAPAN'S PARTICIPATION?
 Japan's previous free trade deals have left out the heavily
protected agriculture sector, but that would not be possible in
the TPP, so many farmers are opposed.
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan has said he wants to open up
Japanese markets but many lawmakers in his own Democratic Party
fear negative fallout for farmers so the party is split.
 Adding Japan's $5 trillion economy would greatly increase
the potential market-opening gains of the proposed pact. But it
could also complicate the negotiations, since Tokyo would have
to free up not only agriculture but address U.S. concerns that
planned postal system reforms will disadvantage private
competitors in the insurance, banking and express delivery
sectors.

 * Beijing concerned about flood of money after U.S. easing
 * China again restates commitment to yuan reform
(Adds more quotes, details)
 By Simon Rabinovitch and Zhou Xin
 BEIJING, Nov 5 (Reuters) - China on Friday pushed back
strongly against U.S. policies ahead of a G20 summit,
ridiculing Washington's plan to set current account targets and
warning of risks in the Fed's monetary easing.
 The remarks by Cui Tiankai, a vice Chinese foreign
minister, were the first high-level expression of Beijing's
stance on the issues.
 ""We believe a discussion about a current account target
misses the whole point. If you look at the global economy,
there are many issues that merit more attention -- for example,
the question of quantitative easing,"" he said.
 The United States proposed at the G20 finance ministers'
meeting last month that countries should cap current account
surpluses or deficits at 4 percent of GDP as part of efforts to
rebalance the global economy.
 The idea of numeric targeting met strong resistance from
Japan and Germany, though some Chinese advisers had said that
Beijing might be able to see eye-to-eye with Washington. Cui
put these suggestions to rest.
 ""Of course, we hope to see more balanced current accounts,""
Cui said. ""But we believe it would not be a good approach to
single out this issue and focus all attention on it. The
artificial setting of a numerical target cannot but remind us
of the days of planned economies.""
 In a briefing on China's outlook for the G20 summit in
Seoul next week, Cui also rejected attempts by other countries
to set targets for yuan appreciation.
 ""That would indeed be asking us to manipulate the
renminbi's exchange rate, and it is something that we will of
course not do,"" he said. The yuan is also known as the
renminbi.
 The United States and European countries, among others,
have accused China of keeping its currency artificially cheap
to give its exporters an unfair advantage. Beijing has
repeatedly stated a commitment to reform the yuan and insisted
that it alone will decide how to do so.
 U.S. EASING
 Cui said China would closely monitor the impact of the
Federal Reserve's plan announced this week to buy $600 billion
of U.S. government bonds to stimulate the economy.
 ""They owe us some explanation,"" he said. ""I've seen much
concern about the impact of this policy on financial stability
in other countries. As the main issuer of a reserve currency,
we would hope that it (the United States) adopts a responsible
position.""
 Cui added that Beijing would appreciate the chance to have
a discussion with the United States about the global
consequences of its quantitative easing.
 ""The Federal Reserve has the right to make its own
decisions, and it need not consult with any other country
beforehand. And there is no one to impose a specific target on
it,"" he said.
 ""But we hope they can consider the impacts on other
countries in the world when they make decisions, not just their
own economy.""
 Emerging market economies said the Fed's move made a
substantive deal on cutting global economic imbalances less
likely at the G20 summit next week.
 GOVERNANCE REFORM
 Despite discord over the Fed's policy and China's slow pace
of currency reform, the Seoul meeting should at least mark a
breakthrough in one area of global monetary reform: the
recalibration of power at the International Monetary Fund.
 The IMF's board will meet on Friday to discuss a G20
proposal to transfer 6 percent of voting power to
under-represented emerging countries, such as China, India and
Brazil, from developed economies.
 ""This is not the end, not even the beginning of the end,
but the end of the beginning,"" Cui said. ""Many countries have
said that the quota system itself needs to be reformed, and the
IMF governance structure also needs to be reformed.""
 The G20 was at a crucial juncture, evolving from an
emergency mechanism to deal with the financial crisis to one
that promotes global governance reform, Cui said.
 With many uncertainties still facing the global economy, a
spirit of cooperation was essential, he said.
 ""China has a saying to describe selfishness, namely
'destroy the bridge once the river has been crossed'. But the
problem is, we have not crossed the river yet, so if someone
wants to destroy the bridge, does he not see the risk of
falling into the water?""

 * Dollar index edges off 11-month low but rebound small
 * Dollar/yen slips after BOJ keeps asset fund size steady
 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The dollar paused near fresh lows on
Friday after breaking down to a new 2010 trough against a basket
of currencies, but investor appetite for risk was expected to
continue and grind the low-yielding greenback down.
 The dollar index hit an 11-month low on Thursday in the
aftermath of a decision by the Federal Reserve to buy government
bonds, opening the way for a possible test of its 2009 low of
74.17. It edged up on Friday but still looked vulnerable.
 The euro was holding above $1.4200 after soaring as far as
$1.4283, its strongest since late January, while the dollar pared
small early gains on the yen, edging closer to its 1995 postwar
record low of 79.75 yen.
 The Fed's commitment this week to open-ended purchases of
Treasuries, implying low funding costs, has renewed the focus on
the dollar as a funding currency for purchases in commodities,
emerging markets and higher-yielding currencies.
 Highlighting the risk-on sentiment that has characterised
markets' reaction to the Fed's plan to pump in more money, share
markets around Asia rose on Friday, while gold hit a record high
and palladium a nine-year high.
 One senior trader at a bank in Hong Kong said the money
flowing into higher yielders and Asian markets was real
investment flow rather than short-term speculative funds.
 ""I think there's still quite a lot of money sitting in cash
around the world and people realise that you've just got to be
invested so that cash has to find a home somewhere,"" he said.
 ""It's generally going to end up in equities and people are
worried about the inflationary implications of QE over the long
term, so I think money is going out of bonds into equities as
well.""
 The dollar stood at 80.82 yen, up 0.1 percent from late New
York levels but well within range of its latest 15-year low of
80.21 set on Monday and perilously close to the record low.
 The Bank of Japan concluded a policy review without easing
policy further after the Fed's decision and the yen firmed
slightly after the announcement on slight disappointment there
was no expansion to its asset buying plan in response to the Fed.
 Analysts expect some weakening in Japan's economic indicators
ahead and some say more easing through asset-buying will be
needed.
 ""Yen strength feels as if it is coming home to roost,"" said
Robert Rennie, chief strategist at Westpac in Sydney. ""Now is the
time for the BOJ to start to stand up and deliver.""
 On the crosses, the yen lost ground this week against the
euro and the Aussie dollar, falling to its lowest since May at
82.15 yen per Australian dollar on Thursday.
 A fall in yen option volatilities has helped boost the
crosses, as it encourages carry trades by suggesting less risk of
currency market swings, a trader at a European bank said.
 One-month dollar/yen option volatility has fallen after the
Fed decision but it still remains above the levels seen earlier
in the decade, and the latest rise in cross/yen was more likely a
knee-jerk reaction to falling volatilities than a real increase
in carry trade flows, the trader said.
 U.S. monthly jobs data is in focus later in the day, after
the Fed's asset-buying decision was accompanied by a pledge to
review the programme regularly ""in light of incoming information""
and adjust it to better foster employment and price stability.
 Economists in a Reuters poll expect 60,000 jobs were created
in October after 95,000 were lost in September. Brian Kim at UBS
said numbers broadly in line with its forecast for a rise in
nonfarm payrolls of 70,000 were unlikely to help the dollar at
the moment.
 ""But if the data surprises strongly on the upside, the dollar
could temporarily strengthen and both risk-seeking positions and
dollar shorts could face some profit-taking into the weekend,"" he
wrote in a client note.
 The euro was steady at $1.4207. Traders report options
barriers at $1.43 and bids around $1.4200-$1.4220.
 Technical strategists also flagged as next targets the
$1.4370 area, a 78.4 retracement of the euro's fall from November
to June, and then $1.4580, the euro's January high.
 The Australian dollar was flat at $1.0151 after climbing as
far as $1.0177, a 28-year peak. The central bank, which raised
rates by 25 basis points this week to 4.75 percent, sounded
upbeat in quarterly remarks but offered no surprises.

 By Kevin Plumberg
 HONG KONG, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose for a fifth
day on Friday, with commodity-related shares helping regional
markets outperform other parts of the world this week after
U.S. Federal Reserve action revived a move into riskier assets.
 Major European stocks followed Asia higher, rising 0.2
percent in early trade ahead of key U.S. jobs data.
 The October U.S. payrolls report due later on Friday is
expected to reflect growth of 60,000 jobs, which while a
relatively small amount would be the first increase since May
and probably enough to keep the risk rally going.
 The Fed's $600 billion bond-buying scheme unveiled on
Wednesday, dubbed QE2 by traders and investors, has resulted in
a scramble to buy laggard equity sectors, especially in
emerging markets, and commodities.
 It has also spurred a shift out of really long-dated debt
on bets that the injection of cheap dollars will keep a
reflation trade going.
 ""What QE2 has done is that it added confidence to our
view,"" said Shane Oliver, director of investment strategy and
chief economist for AMP Capital in Sydney.
 ""We further increased our exposure to Asia and emerging
markets. QE2 provides more confidence that the flow of capital
into emerging markets will continue and add more liquidity into
asset markets,"" said Oliver, who helps manage investments of
some $100 billion.
 The ultimate consequences of QE2 are clear to many
analysts, namely greater risks of capital controls in emerging
markets, asset price bubbles and quickening inflation.
 For now, though, investors have been putting cash to work
in search of higher returns and worrying about the backlash
later.
 Japan's Nikkei share average led gains in Asian stocks a
second day, rising 2.9 percent, with big exporters among the
supporting factors for the index.
 ""Short-covering is the main driver of today's gains, but
foreign investors appear to be picking up shares of companies
that are sensitive to economic cycles such as trading houses
after rallies in oil and gold,"" said Hiroaki Kuramochi, chief
equity marketing officer at Tokai Tokyo Securities in Tokyo.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan was up
0.9 percent, led by 2 percent gains in both the materials and
energy sectors
 The index is up around 5.6 percent so far this week, on
course for the biggest weekly rise since July 2009. For the
year to date, it has risen more than 15 percent, with much of
the gains made in the last few months.
 HIGHER AND HIGHER IN HONG KONG
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng index climbed nearly 1.4 percent on
strong turnover, extending its rise this week to 7.6 percent,
the largest weekly gain since May 2009.
 Investors in Hong Kong have been ploughing money into large
cap stocks such as HSBC Holdings Plc after focusing on small
caps for much of the year, convinced the current rally has
staying power.
 The U.S. dollar index a measure of its performance against
a basket of six other major currencies, held near an 11-month
low, while the euro slipped to $1.4191 having risen to the
highest since January overnight at $1.4283.
 Chronic weakness in the dollar has been a prime factor
lifting commodity prices across the board.
 Three-month copper futures traded on the London Metal
Exchange was up 1.5 percent to the highest since July 2008,
having risen an unrelenting 20 percent since August.
 Crude oil futures were also in the midst of a bull run,
with the December contract up 0.5 percent to $86.88 a barrel
December oil may try to hurdle the May 3 high of $87.15 a
barrel throughout the global day, above which oil would be at
its highest since October 2008.
 Gold advanced to a fresh record high of $1,394 an ounce and
then speculators took profits, causing the metal to reverse
course and fall 0.3 percent on the day to $1,387.96.
 Gold is up some 27 percent so far this year, benefiting
from inflation hedges and a recurring inverse relationship to
the dollar's performance.
 Dealers were not convinced the precious metal's run this
year was over.

 TOKYO, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The dollar struggled near fresh lows
on Friday after breaking down to a new 2010 trough against a
basket of currencies as a Federal Reserve decision this week to
buy government bonds renewed investor appetite for risk assets.
 The dollar index hit an 11-month low on Thursday in the
aftermath of the Fed decision, opening the way for a possible
test of its 2009 low of 74.17, and the euro was holding above
$1.4200 after soaring as far as $1.4283, its strongest since late

 The dollar was also under renewed pressure against the yen,
trading one yen above its 1995 post-war record low of 79.75.
 The Bank of Japan concludes a policy meeting on Friday and is
expected to hold off on further monetary easing, as the Fed's
decision did not immediately trigger sharp yen gains, but it may
discuss the damage of sustained yen strength to the economy.
 The market will pay close attention to U.S. monthly jobs data
later in the day, after the Fed's asset-buying decision was
accompanied by a pledge to review the programme regularly ""in
light of incoming information"" and adjust it to better foster
employment and price stability.

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Nov 4 (Reuters) - World stocks soared to highs
last seen before Lehman Brothers' collapse in 2008 and the
dollar fell sharply on Thursday on rising risk appetite in the
afterglow of the Federal Reserve's asset buying plan.
 The Fed on Wednesday said it would spend $600 billion
buying longer-term Treasury bonds through the end of next June
as part of a renewed quantitative easing program.
 Energy and commodity prices rose, with gold touching record
highs as markets concluded the Fed's move to increase the
supply of dollars would likely weigh the currency down further.
But it also benefits dollar-priced commodities, as it cuts
their cost for other currency holders.
 U.S. government bond prices rose after a $10 billion sale
of reopened Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and after
claims for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last
week, dimming expectations for growth in non-farm payrolls
numbers to be released on Friday.
 The Fed's move was a little more than expected, but not
enough to spook markets with worries about a
worse-than-anticipated U.S. economic picture.
 ""What you achieve with quantitative easing is that you
signal to investors not to buy U.S. government securities, take
the money elsewhere, which in turn will weaken the dollar and
spur economic growth,"" said Axel Merk, president and portfolio
manager at Merk Investments in Palo Alto, California.
 A weaker dollar is viewed as inflationary, but should help
boost a flagging U.S. export sector.
 ""The Fed in my view is trying to debase the dollar because
printing all that money is not going to spur growth on its own.
The risk is that the money doesn't stick and it doesn't go to
where it's supposed to go,"" said Merk, who runs the company's
$500 million currency mutual fund.
 Stocks in general benefit because of the impact of a huge
wave of liquidity flowing into the financial system. For Fed QE

 The prospect of more market intervention by the Fed is
again pushing U.S. bond yields lower, reducing the cost of
borrowing dollars and encouraging investors to use those funds
to buy assets such as commodities, stocks, and higher-yielding
currencies.
 Investors have been plowing into more risky emerging market
sovereign debt. The yield spread between emerging market debt
and U.S. Treasuries as measured by JPMorgan <11EMJ> narrowed to
levels last seen nearly three years ago.
 The Fed's move came as global manufacturing activity
accelerated for the first time in six months, creating a
situation in which an already improving world economy has been
given a sharp monetary stimulus. [ID:nLDE6A115S]
 DOLLAR DUMPED
 The U.S. dollar slumped to a 28-year low versus the
Australian currency and a more than nine-month trough against
the euro as a result of the Fed's decision.
 The dollar fell against a basket currencies, with the U.S.
Dollar Index <.DXY> down 0.83 percent at 75.849.
 The euro  was up 0.54 percent at $1.422 after
touching a nine-month high. Euro gains are being restrained by
concerns over euro zone debt, particularly in Ireland and
Greece.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 0.38
percent at 80.73, close to its 1995 postwar record low of
79.75. Traders remained on alert for yen-selling intervention
by Japanese authorities.
 U.S. government bond prices rose after the $10 billion sale
of TIPS. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note 
rose 27/32, the yield at 2.48 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury
note  was flat, the yield at 0.3276 percent. The
30-year U.S. Treasury bond  rose 7/32, its yield at
4.037 percent.
 The Fed's strategy is to prevent a slide in inflation from
becoming a deflationary spiral of falling wages, growth and
business activity, and market players say a dramatically
steeper yield curve may be the new norm.
 In energy and commodities trading, U.S. light sweet crude
oil  rose $1.97, or 2.33 percent, to $86.66 per barrel,
and spot gold prices  rose $43.74, or 3.25 percent, to
$1391.30 an ounce, touching an all-time high.
 Silver climbed 6 percent to its highest since 1980,
palladium was up nearly 5 percent to a 9-1/2 year peak and
platinum reached its strongest price since 2008.
 ""The dollar got hammered, and a lot of people are concerned
that we are headed for the winds of inflation. It's a perfect
storm for gold today,"" said Bill O'Neill, partner of New
Jersey-based commodities firm LOGIC Advisors.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Nov 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell to a
28-year low against the Australian currency on Thursday and
over a nine-month trough versus the euro after Federal Reserve
plans to buy more Treasuries pushed U.S. yields lower and
prompted investors to seek returns elsewhere.
 The Fed's commitment on Wednesday to open-ended purchases
of Treasuries, implying low funding costs, brings into focus an
expected increased use of the dollar in carry trades. In such
trades, the greenback is used to fund purchases in commodities,
emerging markets and higher-yielding currencies.
 ""As soon as the Fed starts pushing that button and printing
money, that money immediately leaves the U.S. because there are
a lot of more compelling investments overseas than there are in
the U.S. right now,"" said Ihab Salib, senior portfolio manager
and head of international fixed-income at Federated Investors
in Pittsburgh.
 ""My expectation is for a steady trend of a weaker dollar,""
Salib said, adding he expects the dollar to decline more
against currencies of emerging markets and peripheral countries
such as Australia, Canada and Norway than the yen or euro.
 Federated Investors manages $341 billion in assets.
 The euro was last up 0.5 percent at $1.4209, having touched
a 9-1/2-month high at $1.4283 on trading platform EBS and
taking out option barriers at $1.4250. Traders reported more
barriers at $1.43 and bids around $1.4200-$1.4220.
 Technical strategists also flagged the $1.4370 area, the
78.4 retracement of the euro's fall from November to June. The
next target is around $1.4580, the euro's January high.
 Investors awaited a key U.S. jobs report and the outcome of
a policy meeting by the Bank of Japan, both due out on Friday.
 EURO MAY HIT $1.50
 In contrast to the Fed, the Bank of England on Thursday
said it made no changes to its asset purchasing plan. Analysts
had expected the BoE to follow the Fed. The European Central
Bank, meanwhile, kept interest rates unchanged at 1 percent.
 Some market participants are forecasting the euro will hit
$1.50 in short order. Others are skeptical given renewed
worries about the euro zone's sovereign debt woes.
 Salib said he would not be surprised to see the euro at
$1.45 to $1.50 by the end of year. But he added: ""I don't see
it going much beyond that just because what's happening
domestically within Europe.""
 Christian Broda, managing director at the $12 billion hedge
fund Duquesne Capital Management noted ""$1.50 is not what it
used to be in 2006-2007"" in real exchange rate terms. He said a
euro at $1.50 would be the equivalent of $1.35 in 2007 terms.
 ""The euro is in a secular trend which is an appreciation
... Asia is a positive force for the euro's appreciation. It is
in a stage of development that needs a lot of capital goods,""
Broda said, adding Germany -- the biggest euro zone member --
is a beneficiary of Asia's need for capital goods.
 WEAK DOLLAR POLICY?
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said Fed policy actions
do not suggest the United States was actively seeking a weaker
dollar. For details, see
 But policymakers in Latin America and Asia criticized the
U.S. central bank move, saying it made any substantive deal on
cutting global economic imbalances less likely at next week's
Group of 20 meeting in Seoul.
 ""In reality, everything that the Fed is doing -- even
though the U.S. has a strong dollar policy -- is really more of
a weak dollar policy. How they defend themselves within the G20
is going to be interesting,"" Salib said.a basket of six

 By Antonio de la Jara
 SANTIAGO, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Chile's central bank said on
Thursday it would gradually raise foreign investment limits for
pension funds to 80 percent from 60 percent as it seeks to
counter the recent sharp appreciation of the peso .
 The bank said the limits on the pension system, which
manages more than $138 billion, would begin rising in December,
with three more increases coming in the following nine months.
Greater investment abroad would increase demand for dollars,
helping to weaken the peso or at least offset capital inflows.
 Chile's peso has soared nearly 14 percent since the end of
June, prompting intervention warnings from Chilean authorities
concerned about the competitiveness of local exporters.
 The peso was broadly stable after the announcement, closing
up 1.9 percent at 479.90/480.40 per dollar following the
Federal Reserve's unveiling of new monetary stimulus after the
local market close on Wednesday.
 After the Fed announcement, policymakers from the world's
economic powerhouses in Latin America and Asia said they would
consider fresh capital controls.For more, see: [ID:nTOE6A300V]
 Chile's pension fund announcement appeared to be the first
concrete foreign exchange measure adopted after the Fed
announcement, which involves massive debt purchases to lower
long-term interest rates. That makes emerging market
investments more attractive.
 Santiago-based Banchile economist Fernando Soto said the
impact of the new pension policy would not be immediate, as the
local market remains attractive for many investors.
 ""This establishes a cap for the exchange rate to some
degree, although not in the short-term, given that authorities
are taking measures focused on the currency it means we are
already near that cap,"" Soto said.

------------------------------------------------------->
 Chile has held off so far on buying dollars in the local
market, like Colombia, or raising taxes on foreign investment
in local assets, as Brazil did twice last month.
 ""We view the measure as not particularly aggressive,"" said
Jimena Zuniga, with Barclays Capital in New York. ""Despite the
government's concern about ... appreciation pressures, it seems
inclined to concentrate all the efforts on market-friendly
measures at this stage.""
 President Sebastian Pinera said last month that he is not
planning capital controls, and he would like to stem the peso's
appreciation by encouraging more Chilean investment abroad.
 Finance Minister Felipe Larrain told reporters after the
announcement that he had asked the central bank to revise the
pension funds' investment limits.
 The central bank has said it constantly weighs direct
intervention in the foreign exchange market, but fundamentals
do not justify action at the peso's current levels.
 The bank cited the peso's strength when it slowed the pace
of increases to its benchmark interest rate last month. Higher
interest rates have attracted foreign investors in recent
months, adding to the peso's appreciation. [ID:nN14173354]
 Chile's last market intervention came in 2008, when the
peso was trading around 430 per dollar and the central bank
began a program of dollar purchases to increase international
reserves and weaken the peso.
 The bank previously lifted the limits on investment abroad
for Chile's privately administered pension funds beginning in
October 2008, from 45 percent to 60 percent.
 At that point, amid the global financial crisis, fund
administrators were slow to take advantage of the new freedom.
But within 18 months the pension system's most aggressive funds
had expanded their foreign portfolios by more than 12
percentage points.
 Now as then, few of the funds in the privately managed
pension system are investing in foreign assets to the maximum
extent allowable. But the new limits may open possibilities, as
the highest-risk funds will soon be able to invest entirely
overseas.
 ""Just the fact of being authorized to invest a greater
percentage is a very good signal,"" Guillermo Arthur,
association president for Chile's pension fund administrators,
told local media last week after the government said it was
looking at raising the limits.
 ""It allows us to be alert for opportunities to invest
abroad that we couldn't even consider if we didn't have that
margin.""

 By Samantha Pearson and Froilan Romero
 SAO PAULO/SANTIAGO, Nov 4 (Reuters) - The currencies of
Brazil, Chile and Colombia surged on Thursday after the United
States said it would print billions of dollars to rescue its
economy, pressuring Latin American countries to take
counter-measures.
 Much of Latin America is already struggling with sharply
appreciating currencies that make exports less competitive and
threaten growth. The U.S. Federal Reserve's latest plan to pump
another $600 billion into the economy, announced on Wednesday,
is likely to encourage even more inflows and make these
problems worse. For details, see [ID:nTOE6A300V]
 The Brazilian real and the Colombian peso rallied more than
1 percent on Thursday, while Chile's currency soared as much as
2.1 percent in early trading, its biggest one-day percentage
gain in more than a year.
 Chile was quick to fight back, but with little initial
success.
 The country's central bank said on Thursday it would raise
foreign investment limits for pension funds to 80 percent from
60 percent in an effort to encourage outflows. [ID:nN04221079]
 But the peso  still closed 1.9 percent stronger at
479.90 per dollar.
 The problem is that pension funds have chosen for many
months to invest less than this amount outside Chile, said
Flavia Cattan-Naslausky, a strategist at RBS Securities.
Allowing them to invest even more abroad will not necessarily
encourage them to do so, she said.
 ""This measure was very conservative and very much in line""
with recent indications to the market, she said.
 Minutes later, Brazil's finance minister also spoke out
against the Fed's decision, saying his country would protest
the move at the upcoming G20 meeting. [ID:nN04255229]
 BRAZIL ON ALERT AGAIN
 The Brazilian real  bid 1.43 percent stronger at
1.676 reais per U.S. dollar on the local spot market -- its
strongest level in about two weeks and its biggest daily gain
since June.
 ""If Brazil's central bank wants to maintain the real around
1.70 per dollar, it will have to be even more aggressive with
its dollar purchases,"" said Miriam Tavares, currency director
at brokerage AGK Corretora in Sao Paulo.
 Brazil also introduced tax increases last month in an
effort to curb a rally in the real, which is beginning to have
a damaging effect on the real economy.
 Data released on Thursday showed Brazil's industrial
production continued to slow -- a trend some analysts attribute
to the stronger currency. [ID:nN04172855]
 Colombia's peso  also rallied in the wake of the
Fed's decision, gaining 1.1 percent to 1,817.25 per dollar.
 ""It was a blow to the measures that were put forward here
last week,"" said Ana Vera, an analyst at Banco Popular in
Colombia.
 The country's government announced last Friday it would buy
up to $3.7 billion in forwards markets during 2011, among other
measures designed to curb the peso. [ID:nN29291838]
 MEXICAN PESO SET TO OUTPERFORM?
 The Mexican currency  lagged the region's main
currencies, strengthening only 0.2 percent to 12.2351 per
dollar.
 It was boosted late in the previous session when most of
the other currency markets had already closed, leaving the peso
less room for appreciation on Thursday.
 The peso was also shaken slightly by data showing new U.S.
claims for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last
week. [ID:nN03139160]
 Mexico is more susceptible to changes in the outlook for
the U.S. economy due to the two countries' strong trade links.
 But analysts have begun to recommend the Mexican peso as
one of the only currencies in the region that is not currently
at risk from government intervention.

 * Kimberley Process says no agreement yet
 
 (Recasts, adds comments from Kimberley Process, Zimbabwe
minister, background)
 By Steven Scheer
 JERUSALEM, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Zimbabwe said on Thursday it
would soon start selling millions of carats of diamonds from its
controversial Marange fields, even though the global body that
regulates conflict diamonds said it had not yet approved the
sale.
 Officials of Zimbabwe and of the Kimberley Process, the
regulator that certifies diamonds to ensure they are not used to
finance wars, gave conflicting views on what had been the
outcome of a closed-door, four-day meeting in Jerusalem.
 Boaz Hirsch, chairman of the Kimberley Process, said no
agreement had been reached on exports from Marange.
 But Obert Moses Mpofu, Zimbabwe's mines and mining
development minister, when asked whether there was an agreement
for Zimbabwe to sell diamonds from Marange, said: ""Yes"".
 He told reporters after the meeting ended, ""Zimbabwe will
sell diamonds without any conditions. There is no opposition to
that.""
 Mpofu said sales would start immediately but could not say
exactly when. ""Our people have been waiting years,"" he said.
""This will be a major achievement for the economy.""
 But Hirsch said an agreement had not been reached, although
one is expected in the coming days.
 ""We are still working with Zimbabwe and other countries,"" he
said at a news conference. ""We were unable at this stage to
reach a consensus.""
 He added that a few unidentified countries still needed to
approve certification.
 ""It's safe to say we will be engaging with them heavily as
of tomorrow,"" Hirsch said, noting that it took extra time to
reach an earlier agreement this year after another meeting in
Tel Aviv.
 
 POLITICS
 He warned Zimbabwe to wait until it receives certification,
saying: ""We expect each country to act in accordance with the
Kimberley Process.""
 Hirsch declined to say what action the body would take if
Zimbabwe were to start selling Marange diamonds without an
agreement.
 Mpofu earlier this week told Reuters that Zimbabwe had a
stockpile of as much as 4.5 million carats of diamonds to sell.
Mining, he added, accounts for some 30 percent of the economy.
 In June, Zimbabwe's government agreed that diamonds from
Marange would be sold only under the Kimberley Process.
 Marange became involved with the Kimberley Process after
30,000 illegal diggers descended on the fields in 2006,
prompting the government to deploy the army to stop rampant
panning and smuggling.
 Civil rights groups accused the security forces of
committing atrocities during the crackdown.
 Zimbabwe has accused the West of a plot to stop it from
benefitting from diamonds, but it received approval for two
shipments of diamonds in July. The Marange mine -- at 66,000
hectares (163,100 acres) -- is largely untapped.
 Mpofu said some Western countries used the Kimberley Process
as a forum to air their political frustrations and, ""this is
unacceptable"". He rejected the notion of human rights abuses in
Zimbabwe.
 ""We're not benefitting from being a member of the Kimberley
Process, but we are still a member. We believe in doing things
the orderly way,"" Mpofu said.
 In addition to Marange, Zimbabwe exports diamonds through a
domestic unit of global miner Rio Tinto.

US$1.0152, up 1 percent. The New Zealand dollar rallied to its
highest since mid-2008 at US$0.7976, and was last up 2.1
percent at US$0.7954.
 Currency volatility, a gauge of market sentiment, fell in a
variety of currencies including the Australian and New Zealand
dollars on Thursday. Lower volatility tends to improve risk
appetite and are usually a go-signal to increase carry trades.
 Against the yen, the dollar eased to 80.63 yen, close to
its 1995 postwar record low of 79.75. Traders remained on alert
for yen-selling intervention by Japanese authorities.

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Nov 4 (Reuters) - World stocks reached over
two-year highs last seen before Lehman Brothers' collapse and
the dollar fell sharply on Thursday on rising risk appetite in
the afterglow of the Federal Reserve's asset buying plan.
 The Fed on Wednesday said it would spend $600 billion
buying longer-term Treasury bonds through to the end of next
June as part of a renewed quantitative easing (QE) program.
 Energy and commodity prices rose as the markets concluded
the Fed's move to increase dollar supply would likely weigh the
currency down further, benefitting dollar-priced commodities as
it cuts their cost for other currency holders.
 U.S. government bonds rose after claims for unemployment
benefits rose by more than expected last week, dimming
expectations for growth in non-farm payrolls numbers to be
released on Friday.
 The Fed's move was a little more than expected, but not
enough to spook markets with worries about a
worse-than-anticipated U.S. economic picture.
 ""What you achieve with quantitative easing is that you
signal to investors not to buy U.S. government securities, take
the money elsewhere, which in turn will weaken the dollar and
spur economic growth,"" said Axel Merk, president and portfolio
manager at Merk Investments in Palo Alto, California.
 A weaker dollar is viewed as inflationary, but should help
boost a flagging U.S. export sector.
 ""The Fed in my view is trying to debase the dollar because
printing all that money is not going to spur growth on its own.
The risk is that the money doesn't stick and it doesn't go to
where it's supposed to go,"" said Merk, who runs the company's
$500 million currency mutual fund.
 Stocks in general benefit because of the impact of a huge
wave of liquidity into the financial system. For Fed QE PDF

 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
European shares closed up 1.6 percent to hit levels not seen
since April and Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed up 2.17 percent.
The prospect of more market intervention by the Fed is again
pushing U.S. bond yields lower, reducing the cost of borrowing
dollars and encouraging investors to use those funds to buy
assets such as commodities, stocks, and higher-yielding
currencies.
 Investors have been ploughing into more risky emerging
market sovereign debt. The yield spread between emerging market
debt and U.S. Treasuries as measured by JPMorgan <11EMJ>
narrowed to levels last seen nearly three years ago.
 The move to QE also came as global manufacturing activity
accelerated for the first time in six months, creating a
situation in which an already improving world economy has been
given a sharp monetary stimulus. [ID:nLDE6A115S]
 DOLLAR DUMPED
 The U.S. dollar slumped hitting a 28-year low versus the
Australian currency and a more than nine-month trough against
the euro as a Federal Reserve decision to print more money and
buy $600 billion in Treasuries prompted investors to seek
returns elsewhere.
 The dollar, seen as ""the victim"" fell against a basket
currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> down 0.83 percent
at 75.849.
 The euro  was up 0.54 percent at $1.422 after
touching a nine-month high. Euro gains are being restrained by
concerns over euro zone debt, particularly in Ireland and
Greece.
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 0.43
percent at 80.69 from a previous session close of 81.040.
 U.S. government bonds were higher yet appetite for Treasury
supply in the post-Fed announcement world will be gauged later
in the day in an auction of $10 billion of reopened 10-year
Treasury inflation-protected securities.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
27/32, with the yield at 2.48 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury
note  was up /32, with the yield at 0.3276 percent.
The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was up 7/32, with
the yield at 4.037 percent.
 The Fed's strategy is to prevent a slide in inflation from
becoming a deflationary spiral of falling wages, growth and
business activity, and market players say a dramatically
steeper yield curve may be the new norm.
 In energy and commodities prices, U.S. light sweet crude
oil  rose $1.50, or 1.77 percent, to $86.19 per barrel,
and spot gold prices  rose $31.65, or 2.35 percent, to
$1379.30 an ounce, within a few dollars of its recent record at
$1,347.15 as the dollar weakened.
 Silver climbed 3 percent to its highest since 1980,
palladium was up nearly 5 percent to a 9-1/2 year peak and
platinum reached its strongest since May.

 By Christina Fincher
 LONDON, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Stubbornly high inflation has
deterred the Bank of England from following the Federal Reserve
down the path of printing more money, and looks set to limit its
room for manoeuvre even if the economy slows next year.
 Over the past six months growth and inflation in Britain
have both surprised on the upside. While many of the factors
driving the recovery may be short-lived -- a rebound in
construction for example -- inflation is likely to prove a more
protracted problem.
 Commodity, energy and food prices have all risen strongly
over the past two months. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, which
measures 19 different commodities <.CRB>, showed prices rose by
4.5 percent in October after a whopping 8.5 percent gain in
September.
 A rise in UK sales tax in January will give a further leg-up
to consumer prices.
 While the BoE would normally be prepared to ignore a
""one-off"" tax change, it is the second rise in VAT in two years
and could add to concern among investors that the central bank
is taking its eye off the inflation ball.
 Inflation in the United States is running at 1.1 percent and
falling, but in Britain it is 3.1 percent and could rise close
to 4 percent early next year.
 A Reuters poll taken after surprisingly strong third quarter
GDP data last week showed 26 out of 48 economists polled still
expected the BoE to expand its quantitative easing programme,
adding to the 200 billion pounds of assets purchased between
March 2009 and January this year.
 Those predicting an increase tipped February as the most
likely time. By then, however, the BoE still will not have
enough data to gauge how the economy has started the year.
 ""The Bank of England has consistently underestimated
inflation in recent quarters and this remains a risk going
forward,"" said Simon Hayes, UK economist at Barclays Capital.
 ""I think more QE is not as likely as people think.""
 
 INFLATION MANDATE
 Unlike the Federal Reserve which has a dual mandate to
control inflation and support employment, Britain's central bank
is charged solely with keeping inflation near a 2 percent target
-- a goal it has missed every month so far this year.
 BoE Governor Mervyn King has argued that spare capacity in
the economy will be enough to push inflation back to target in
the medium term. He is likely to reiterate that message when he
presents the bank's quarterly growth and inflation forecasts
next Wednesday.
 But King is now at the dovish end of the nine-member
committee and comments from those in the centre ground suggest a
growing preoccupation that inflation pressures might not subside
as previously hoped.
 One, Andrew Sentance, has called for interest rates to rise
for some months.
 Since the BoE's August forecasting round, GDP growth and
inflation have turned out higher than the expected, equity
prices have risen and the pound has fallen almost 3 percent in
trade-weighted terms.
 With government bond yields -- which dictate borrowing costs
more broadly -- already near record lows, it is questionable
what an expansion of the BoE's 200 billion pound gilt pile would
achieve.
 Expectations of more bond purchases from the Fed, as well as
hopes the BoE might follow suit, pushed five-year gilt yields
 to an all-time low of 1.4 percent at the end of
October.
 ""Since most government debt markets react to the trend in
U.S. Treasuries, gilt yields have fallen without the BoE having
to act,"" said Brian Hilliard, UK economist at Societe Generale.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Nov 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar slumped on
Thursday, hitting a 28-year low against the Australian currency
and a more than nine-month trough against the euro as a Federal
Reserve decision to buy more Treasuries pushed U.S. yields
lower and prompted investors to seek returns elsewhere.
 The Fed's commitment to open-ended purchases of Treasuries,
implying low funding costs, brings into focus an expected
increased use of the dollar in carry trades in which the U.S.
dollar is used to fund purchases in commodities, emerging
markets and higher-yielding currencies.
 ""What you achieve with quantitative easing is that you
signal to investors not to buy U.S. government securities, take
the money elsewhere, which in turn will weaken the dollar and
spur economic growth,"" said Axel Merk, president and portfolio
manager at Merk Investments in Palo Alto, California.
 A weaker dollar is viewed as inflationary, but should help

 ""The Fed in my view is trying to debase the dollar because
printing all that money is not going to spur growth on its
own,"" said Merk, who runs the company's $500 million currency
mutual fund.
 In contrast to the Fed, the Bank of England on Thursday
said it made no changes to its asset purchasing plan. Analysts
had initially expected the BoE to follow the Fed.
 The European Central Bank, meanwhile, kept interest rates
unchanged at 1 percent on Thursday with ECB President
Jean-Claude Trichet making no major announcement.
 He did, however, say that Fed policy actions do not suggest
that the the United States was actively seeking a weaker
dollar. For details, see [ID:nLDE6A3217
 In midday New York trade, the euro  was at
$1.4220, up 0.5 percent on the day, having touched a
9-1/2-month high at $1.4273, according to EBS data. Traders
reported that an option barrier at $1.4250 was taken out. There
are more barriers at $1.43.
 Bids on the euro are also expected around $1.4200-$1.4220.
 Technical strategists also flagged the $1.4365 level, the
78.4 retracement of the move from the November high of $1.5140
to the June $1.1875 slide.
 EURO AT $1.50 NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE
 Some market participants are forecasting the euro to hit
$1.50 in short order.
 But Christian Broda, managing director at the $12 billion
hedge fund Duquesne Capital Management noted ""$1.50 is not what
it used to be in 2006-2007"" in real exchange rate terms.
 He also said that a euro at $1.50 today would be the
equivalent of $1.35 in 2007 terms.
 ""I think the euro is in a secular trend which is an
appreciation ... Asia is a positive force for the euro's
appreciation. It is in a stage of development that needs a lot
of capital goods,"" Broda said, adding Germany -- the biggest
euro zone member -- is a beneficiary of Asia's need for capital
goods.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, a gauge of its performance against
a basket of six currencies, fell to an 11-month low at 75.698,
taking out trendline support from its March 2008 lows. The
index was down 0.9 percent at 75.768.

 The Australian dollar, whose central bank raised rates by
25 basis points to 4.75 percent this week, hit a post-float
high at US$1.0148 . It was last at US$1.0136, up 0.8
percent. The New Zealand dollar rallied to its highest since
mid-2008 at US$0.7976 , and was up more than 2 percent
on the day at US$0.7961.
 Currency volatility, a gauge of market sentiment, fell in
a variety of currencies on Thursday. One-month implied
volatility for the Australian dollar fell to 13.55 vols from
14.05 on Wednesday, while that of the New Zealand dollar slid
to 12.95 vols from 13.65 the previous session.
 Lower volatility tends to improve risk appetite and are
usually a go-signal to increase carry trades, particularly long
positions in the Aussie or New Zealand dollars.
 Against the yen, the dollar eased to 80.63 yen ,
close to its 1995 postwar record low of 79.75. A major Asian
sovereign account was a seller in European trade. Traders
remained on alert for possible yen-selling intervention by
Japanese authorities.

 * Gas production can cover 15 percent of Bulgarian needs
 
 (Adds energy minister quote in paragraph 8)
 SOFIA, Nov 4 (Reuters) - British oil and gas explorer
Melrose Resources started natural gas production from two fields
in Bulgaria on Thursday and the government said they could meet
about 15 percent of the country's annual gas needs.
 Melrose is developing the Kaliakra and Kavarna gas fields in
the Black Sea, offshore northeastern Bulgaria, with estimated
combined reserves of 74 billion cubic feet (bcf), it said in a
statement.
 ""Commissioning activities on the fields started on November
1 and the fields are today being officially opened to commercial
production. The combined field production plateau rate is
expected at approximately 45 mcf (million cubic feet) per day,""
Melrose said.
 Melrose said the recent discovery of the 12 bcf East Kavarna
field would supplement the production from the two new fields
and has the potential to extend the combined production plateau
to around three years.
 The Bulgarian energy ministry said Melrose's gas could
secure about 15 percent of the natural gas consumption in the
country over the next few years. The European Union country's
annual needs stand at 4 billion-5 billion cubic metres.
 The new gas production will also allow cheaper natural gas
prices for industries and households, the ministry said.
 It will also help Bulgaria lower its almost full dependence
on Russian gas supplies and improve its position at pending
talks over new gas deals with Russia's pipeline gas export
monopoly Gazprom.
 ""This is a small but certain step towards a diversification
and our desire not to depend on a sole natural gas supplier,""
Economy and Energy Minister Traicho Traikov said after attending
the symbolic start of gas production.
 Recession-hit Bulgaria was forced to increase the natural
gas price by 24.6 percent in July to reflect the higher prices
for imports from Russia.
 Since then, Sofia has negotiated a minor drop in the price
the Russian gas giant sells gas to Bulgaria and hopes to ensure
more significant price cuts as of next year.

747,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2010 11:08AM ET</span>","Global trade picks up in October, led by U.S. -PMIs"," LONDON, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Global trade growth picked up for
the first time in six months during October with the United
States charging ahead but is still only running at half the rate
it was in May, according to surveys published this week.
 The strongest rise in new export orders during the last
month came in the U.S., with other developed countries hot on
its heels, but emerging markets saw a near stagnation of
exports, according to a summary report.
 Markit, who compiled the data, said the figures were
consistent with global trade growing at an annual rate of 14
percent -- half what it was earlier this year but a vast
improvement on the 28 percent plunge seen in 2009.
 The strong growth in U.S. exports is likely to have been
stimulated by the weakness of the dollar, Markit said. The
greenback may have further to fall after the Federal Reserve
committed on Wednesday to buying $600 billion of government
bonds.
 The dollar slumped to a 2010 low against a basket of
currencies in the middle of October, around the time the surveys
were taken, on expectations the Fed would start printing money
through further quantitative easing, buying government bonds.
 The prospect of ultra-low returns in the U.S. has driven
investors into higher-yielding emerging markets, pushing those
currencies higher and sparking anxiety over a loss of export
competitiveness.
 ""We are all under attack by the relaxed monetary policy of
the United States,"" Colombian Finance Minister Juan Carlos
Echeverry told investors on Tuesday.
 The surveys suggested China and India's growth was only
modest compared to many developed countries, while Taiwan, South
Korea, Russia and Brazil all saw a drop in exports during the
month, Markit said.

 MILAN/MUMBAI, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Waning investor interest in

Thursday as shares in Enel Green Power fell on their debut while
Coal India's soared.
 Enel Green Power (EGP), which generates clean energy from

a cut price offered to lure investors.
 Shares of Coal India, a similar sized share sale at around

quite capital-intensive, in a world that is capital-constrained,

upper end of their price guidance.
 But EGP's parent company Enel, an Italian power giant that
also controls Spain's Endesa, struggled to woo professional
investors for the sale of up to a third of its renewable unit
against a backdrop of underperforming green energy stocks
 It was forced to cut the price to 1.6 euros a share from a
price range of 1.8-2.1 euros, and early guidance of 1.8-2.4
euros, raising only 2.5 billion euros ($3.5 billion) compared
with the 3 billion euros it had wanted to help reduce debt.
 Institutional investors had raised concerns over EGP's lower
growth rate versus peers, its lack of a track record and
uncertainty on green energy incentives, despite its wider
geographical footprint and technology mix.
 The Italian power giant, which also controls Spanish utility
Endesa, eventually managed to get the deal away thanks to
interest from retail investors, but it will raise less than its
3 billion euro ($4.2 billion) target, key to cut debt.
 Even after the price cut, shares fell over four percent both
in Milan and Madrid on the first day of trading.
 """"In any jumbo IPO you want it to trade up so that you can
say the market has a good feeling about it, but I don't think a
lot of people expected this to trade well given how much went to
retail,"" said a source close to the deal.
 By contrast, an attractive IPO valuation for India's
dominant coal miner spurred demand from investors who applied
for more than 15 times the number of shares on offer in the
country's largest-ever IPO. Enel Green Power IPO was just 1.1
times covered.
 The Coal India listing comes at a time of record foreign
fund inflows into Indian stocks and in one of the best years for
IPO fundraisings for the country.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Nov 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar slumped on
Thursday, hitting a 28-year low versus the Australian currency
and a more than nine-month trough against the euro as a Federal
Reserve decision to buy more Treasuries pushed U.S. yields
lower and prompted investors to seek returns elsewhere.
 The Fed's commitment to open-ended purchases of Treasuries,
implying low funding costs, brings into focus an expected
increased use of the dollar in carry trades in which the U.S.
currency is used to fund purchases in commodities, emerging
markets and higher-yielding currencies.
 ""What you achieve with quantitative easing is that you
signal to investors not to buy U.S. government securities, take
the money elsewhere, which in turn will weaken the dollar and
spur economic growth,"" said Axel Merk, president and portfolio
manager at Merk Investments in Palo Alto, California.
 A weaker dollar is viewed as inflationary, but should help
boost a flagging U.S. export sector.
 ""The Fed in my view is trying to debase the dollar because
printing all that money is not going to spur growth on its own.
The risk is that the money doesn't stick and it doesn't go to
where it's supposed to go,"" said Merk, who runs the company's
$500 million currency mutual fund.
 In contrast to the Fed, the Bank of England on Thursday
said it made no changes to its asset purchasing plan. Analysts
had initially expected the BoE to follow the Fed.
 The European Central Bank, meanwhile, kept interest rates
unchanged at 1 percent on Thursday with ECB President
Jean-Claude Trichet making no major announcement. See Trichet
comments [ID:nFAT007162].
 In early New York trade the euro  was at $1.4254,
up 0.8 percent on the day, having touched a 9-1/2-month high at
$1.4273, according to EBS data. Traders reported an option
barrier at $1.4250 was taken out, and options with strike
prices of $1.4300 set to expire later in the day.
 Bids on the euro are also expected around $1.4200-$1.4220.
 Technical strategists also flagged the $1.4365 level, the
78.4 retracement of the move from the November high of $1.5140
to the June $1.1875 slide.
 POTENTIAL EURO HURDLE
 Other currency strategists such as Tom Levinson at ING
Capital Markets, on the other hand, said the $1.43 area could
serve as a cap for the euro. Levinson cited this weekend's
Greek local elections as a potential challenge.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, a gauge of its performance against
a basket of six currencies, fell to an 11-month low at 75.698,
taking out trendline support from its March 2008 lows. The
index was down 0.9 percent at 75.768.

 The Australian dollar, whose central bank raised rates by
25 basis points to 4.75 percent this week, hit a post-float
high at US$1.0148 . It was last at US$1.0136, up 0.8
percent. The New Zealand dollar rallied to its highest since
mid-2008 at US$0.7976 , and was up more than 2 percent
on the day at US$0.7961.
 Currency volatility, a gauge of market sentiment, in a
variety of currencies fell on Thursday. One-month implied vols
for the Australian dollar fell to 13.55 vols from 14.05 on
Wednesday, while that of the New Zealand dollar slid to 12.95
vols from 13.65 the previous session.
 Lower vols tend to improve risk appetite and are usually a
go-signal to increase carry trades with long positions in the
Aussie or New Zealand dollars.
 Against the yen, the dollar eased to 80.68 yen ,
close to its 1995 postwar record low of 79.75. A major Asian
sovereign account was a seller in European trade. Traders
remained on alert for possible yen-selling intervention by
Japanese authorities.

754,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2010 10:04AM ET</span>","G20 warned of protectionism, currency tension"," * Protectionism intensifying
 * Exchange rate tensions threaten global economy
 
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Nov 4 (Reuters) - The global economy is threatened
by ""dark clouds"" of intensifying protectionist pressures, the
heads of three international organisations said on Thursday in a
warning to leaders of the G20.
 These pressures are driven by high unemployment,
macroeconomic imbalances and tensions over foreign exchange
rates, said the heads of the World Trade Organization (WTO),
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
 ""The stability of the trading system will be put at
considerable risk if currencies move in what some perceive as
the pursuit of an exchange-rate-induced comparative advantage,""
they said in a summary of reports ordered by the G20 for its
summit in Seoul next week.
 ""We urge G20 governments to address these risks,"" WTO
Director-General Pascal Lamy, OECD Secretary-General Angel
Gurria and UNCTAD Secretary-General Supachai Panitchpakdi said
in the summary, whose message was reported by Reuters on
Wednesday.
 
 SHIFT IN TONE
 The G20 committed to keeping markets open at its first
summit in Washington two years ago to deal with the financial
crisis and also at subsequent meetings. It commissioned regular
reports from the three organisations to monitor trade and
investment policy for protectionism.
 Previous reports from the three had concluded that
protectionism was being held in check, so Thursday's warning
marks a significant shift in tone.
 The WTO forecasts that global export volumes will rebound by
an unprecedented 13.5 percent this year. But trade, both a motor
and reflection of recovery, has slowed in recent months and is
at risk from economic uncertainty and protectionism.
 WTO chief Lamy and UNCTAD officials have warned in recent
weeks specifically of the risks to the economy of currency
tension, but the direct warning from the three heads to the G20
in the report shows just how strong these concerns have become.
 Tensions over exchange rates and monetary policy have
bedevilled U.S.-Chinese relations for months and many other
countries, including G20-host South Korea, Japan and Brazil have
also sounded the alarm about their partners' policies.
 The Federal Reserve launched a new effort on Wednesday to
support the U.S. economy by printing money to buy bonds, but
critics fear the policy will lead to high inflation and worry
low interest rates in the United States could fuel asset bubbles
in other countries and destabilise currencies. 
 In a report on trade, the WTO said G20 countries had
continued to exercise restraint in imposing new restrictions
since their last summit in Toronto at the end of June.
 New measures, increasing but at a slower rate, covered 0.3
percent of G20 imports and 0.2 percent of total world imports.
 But the steady accumulation of measures since the financial
crisis burst in 2008 meant restrictions now covered 1.8 percent
of G20 imports, and only 15 percent of them had been withdrawn.
 ""This is too low. G20 governments need to give priority to
removing those measures,"" the three heads said.
 On foreign investment, UNCTAD and the OECD said the G20
countries were resisting protectionism, with the majority of
measures taken by 17 G20 states since the last summit aiming to
facilitate and encourage investment flows.
 But James Zhan, who heads UNCTAD's investment and enterprise
division, said this assessment did not include the protectionist
way in which governments were handling existing rules.
 ""We do observe a kind of covert investment protectionism in
the implementation of existing investment policies,"" he told a
news conference. He noted approval of new investment projects
was particularly subject to obstacles -- an apparent reference
to Canada's decision to block BHP Billiton's $39 billion bid for
Potash Corp.
 The share of restrictive measures in total investment
policies had risen to 30 percent in 2009 from 2 percent in 2008.
 Flows to G20 countries of foreign direct investment such as
cross-border mergers and greenfield investments plunged 36
percent in the second quarter of this year.
 Zhan said this included a rise of 20 percent of investment
flows to China and 30 percent to Russia.
 But overall UNCTAD was sticking to its view that global FDI
flows would stagnate at about $1.2 trillion this year -- still
25 percent below the average in 2005-2007, the three years
before the crisis -- with no significant recovery in sight.

 * Warns of risk of speculation
 * Downside risk to OPEC oil demand, more non-OPEC supply
 * OPEC spare capacity 6-7 million bpd to 2014

 By Barbara Lewis and Alex Lawler
 LONDON, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Global oil demand next year could
bounce back to levels last seen in 2007 as recovery from the
deepest recession in decades drives fuel use, but OPEC does not
plan to add extra capacity as more non-OPEC supply curbs the
need.
 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries also
added its voice to the clamour for regulation in an annual
report published on Thursday -- the day after the U.S. announced
a new round of quantitative easing, raising the prospect of a
deeper dollar decline and waves of cheap money flowing across
asset classes.
 ""While the worries surrounding excessive price volatility
and the role of speculation have somewhat diminished over the
past 12 months or so, it is essential we do not forget the price
extremes that the market witnessed back in 2008,"" OPEC wrote.
 Its World Oil Outlook said demand growth of 1 million
barrels per day (bpd) in 2010 had been more than double that
predicted in last year's outlook and would next year edge up by
1.1 million bpd, taking absolute consumption to 86.6 million
bpd.
 For the medium term to 2014, it said world oil consumption
would rise to 89.9 million bpd, an increase of 5.4 million bpd
from 2009 and an upward revision from its forecast in last
year's report of 89.1 million bpd.
 At the same time, OPEC assumed an oil price of $75-to-$85 a
barrel to 2020 -- below Thursday's session high of more than $86
-- and said there was too much uncertainty to justify further
expansions to OPEC output capacity.
""Current investments should be enough to satisfy both demand
for OPEC crude and provide a comfortable cushion of spare
capacity, which already exceeds the very high level of 6 million
bpd,"" OPEC Secretary General Abdullah al-Badri wrote in an
introduction to the 281-page report.
 ""Downside demand risks for OPEC oil are substantial,
suggesting that rising levels of unused capacity are a real
concern,"" the report said.
 Non-OPEC supply would increase by 2.2 million bpd between
2009 and 2014, while demand for OPEC crude would reach only 30.6
million bpd by 2014 from 28.7 million bpd in 2009, less than
last year's forecast.

 STABILITY AND UNCERTAINTY
 Sluggish recovery from global recession and weak demand has
helped to hold international benchmark U.S. crude in a $70-$80
range for much of the year.
 It broke above that level in the weeks ahead of Wednesday's
announcement of further U.S. quantitative easing and as the U.S.
dollar fell.
 A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated commodities
cheaper, but also reduces the value of petrodollars for resource
holders.
 In that context, Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi on
Monday said oil in a $70-to-$90 range was comfortable for
consumers, marking a shift upwards from the $70-to-$80 the top
exporter had previously said was ideal for producers and
consumers.
 However, a senior Gulf source on Thursday said $70-to-$80
was still a fair price.
 Leading exporter Saudi Arabia and OPEC in general have been
careful to state they are not setting official price targets,
but they also make clear carrying spare capacity can be a huge
financial risk.
 ""The recent contraction in economic activity and the
accompanying dramatic fall in global oil demand have highlighted
the concerns surrounding the risks of over- or under-investing,""
OPEC said.
 ""The implications for OPEC investment needs are startling:
the difference between the higher and lower growth scenarios
over the next decade reaches $230 billion in real terms. This
emphasises the fact that concerns over security of demand are
genuine.""
Demand can be destroyed by an overly high price and it
collapsed after the record rally of 2008 when oil peaked at
nearly $150 a barrel before crashing to just above $30.

 OSLO, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Norway's $500-billion-plus sovereign
wealth fund said on Thursday the potential introduction of
capital controls across the world was a leading risk factor as
the global economy remains unbalanced.
 ""If you look at the risk spectrum of a fund of our size
which invests globally, the potential for restrictions for
capital flows is very high on the radar,"" the Norwegian fund's
chief executive Yngve Slyngstad told Reuters in an interview.
 Slyngstad declined to comment directly on the U.S. Federal
Reserve's decision to extend its quantitative easing, which has
triggered calls for measures to curb capital inflows in emerging
economies in Asia and Latin America.
 ""World imbalances seem not to go away, they are still with
us and consequences are starting to appear, also in the
countries (that) are looking on how they can potentially control
these capital flows,"" Slyngstad said.
 Slyngstad said the fund was a big buyer of Spanish debt
early in the third quarter, while its other Eurobond holdings
remained largely unchanged over July-September. 
 The bulk of new inflows to the fund were invested in U.S.
assets, partly as a result of the U.S. dollar's weakening
against the euro.
 Norway's wealth fund, the world's second largest after its
peer in the United Arab Emirates, published strong third quarter
results on Thursday and picked a prime London retail site for
its first ever real estate purchase.

 BERLIN, Nov 4 (Reuters) - German Economy Minister Rainer

 ""I view that not without concern,"" Bruederle said, adding
that a variety of measures were needed to solve the problem and
it was not enough to pump in liquidity alone.
 ""We hope the U.S. economy gets back up stronger on its

 Bruederle also said there was some truth to the criticism
that the United States was influencing the dollar's exchange
rate with monetary policy and voiced concern about increased

 Its action lifted riskier assets around the world despite
concerns the programme could do more harm than good.
 Bruederle said China had been criticised for having an
undervalued currency but Beijing argues that U.S. monetary
policy is also artificially influencing its currency. The German
minister said there was some truth to that.
 He said a currency war would be a ""disaster"" which must be

 Bruederle dismissed criticism from some countries that
Germany had not done enough to fight economic imbalances. He
said Germany has already done its homework to fight imbalances.

 By Renee Maltezou and Angeliki Koutantou
 ATHENS, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Greek police detonated a parcel
bomb on Thursday addressed to the French embassy in Athens and
were investigating others packages at a courier company in a
city suburb.
 A police source said it was too early to say whether they
were part of a new wave of devices sent to foreign governments
and embassies since Monday by what the government has described
as Greek ""extreme left, anarchist groups"".
 But a Transport Ministry source said authorities had no
plans to extend a 48-hour suspension on air freight abroad of
mail and packages from Greece imposed on Wednesday.
 ""Greece is not planning for the time being to extend the
suspension. The reason for the 48-hour pause was to check all
parcels destined for delivery abroad,"" the official, who
declined to be named, said.
 ""The checks will be concluded later tonight,"" the official
said. The suspension is set to end shortly after midnight Greek
time (2200 GMT). Another official said, however, that a final
decision would be taken after consultation with police.
 Small bombs exploded at the Swiss and Russian embassies in
Athens on Tuesday, a parcel with explosives was intercepted at
the German chancellor's office and another package addressed to
Italy's prime minister caught fire when it was checked.
The devices may be intended to spur an anti-government vote
in Sunday's local elections in protest against Prime Minister
George Papandreou's austerity plan, agreed with the EU and
International Monetary Fund to deal with Greece's debt mountain.
 After more than twenty arrests among their ranks, urban
guerrillas may also want to show that they can still strike.
 ""All evidence shows this is a clear domestic case, with no
connection with international terrorism,"" Greek Foreign Minister
Dimitris Droutsas has said. ""The evidence so far shows we are
dealing with extreme left, anarchist groups.""
 Police carried out Thursday's controlled explosion outside a
courier company, a Reuters witness said. A police source said
the bomb had been concealed in a large book.
 ""It was an explosive device,"" a police spokesman said. 
 Police said the package addressed to Italy's Silvio
Berlusconi was also a book containing an explosive device.
Police say most of the parcel bombs burst into flames when they
are opened rather than exploding in transit.
 Police were also investigating suspicious parcels at a
courier company in the Athens suburb of Markopoulo. 
 ""We are checking them,"" a police spokesman told Reuters,
without saying how many suspect packages there were.

 TORONTO, Nov 4 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar rose to a
near three-week high against the U.S. dollar on Thursday as
risk appetite was whetted by the U.S. Federal Reserve's plan to
buy more U.S. government debt, but was undermined by Ottawa's
decision to block BHP Billiton's bid for Potash Corp .
 The Canadian dollar, like most other major currencies, was
on the rise as investors jettisoned the greenback after the Fed
said on Wednesday that it would buy $600 billion more in U.S.
Treasuries. [FRX/]
 But as Ottawa rejected BHP Billiton's bid for Potash Corp
late on Wednesday, the Canadian dollar snapped about 50 basis
points lower to C$1.01 to the U.S. dollar. [ID:nN03272751]
 While it steadily recovered during the overseas session and
hit its highest since Oct. 15 against the greenback, the
Canadian dollar trailed on the crosses, except against the
yen.
 ""It's lagging because of Potash,"" said Jack Spitz, managing
director of foreign exchange at National Bank Financial.
 ""The decision with respect to Potash is not a positive
story for the Canadian dollar...certainly from an immediate
perspective.""
 Still, as riskier assets such as commodities and equity
markets bask in the Fed's asset buying plan, it will likely put
a floor under any Canadian dollar weakness in the short term
and keep parity with the greenback firmly in view, Spitz
added.
 At 8:20 a.m. (1220 GMT), the Canadian dollar reached a
session high at C$1.0013 to the U.S. dollar, or 99.87 U.S.
cents, up from Wednesday's close at C$1.0068 to the U.S.
dollar, or 99.32 U.S. cents.
 Canadian government debt prices were steady the day after
the Fed's decision, with investors saying the Fed's plan had
already been priced in.
 The two-year bond  was unchanged to yield 1.419
percent, while the 10-year bond  was up 2 Canadian
cents to yield 2.859 percent.
 The Fed's debt purchase program was the marquee event in a
crammed week of other notable concerns. Policy decisions from
the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, as well as
Canadian and U.S. jobs data for October are still to come over
the remainder of the week.

 * Crown slightly up, broke 2-yr high earlier
 * News conference at 1330 GMT
 
 (Adds crown, quote, background)
 PRAGUE, Nov 4 (Reuters) - The Czech central bank kept
interest rates flat on Thursday as expected, reflecting weak
demand-led inflation pressures, strong currency, and fiscal cuts
that will hold back household spending.
 The bank's governing board voted to keep the key two-week
repo rate used to drain excess liquidity at a record low of 0.75
percent where it has been since May.
 The Czech rate is the third lowest in Europe and below the
euro zone's where the ECB was expected to leave its benchmark
rate unchanged at 1 percent on Thursday.
 Eighteen out of 19 analysts in a Reuters poll expected the
bank to keep rates flat. One forecast a 25 basis point rise.
 Bets on interest rate markets also suggested no change, with
forward rate agreements  pricing stable rates until
May 2011 when they start pricing in a quarter point hike.
 The crown slightly firmed to 24.395 to the euro 
from 24.425 following the decision. The unit hit a two-year high
of 24.36 per euro earlier on Thursday.
 Most analysts said the bank would raise inflation and GDP
outlooks in the quarterly update of its staff forecast, pushing
the time of an expected rate hike to the first or second quarter
next year from the third quarter implied in the August forecast.
 ""If the central bank has given up its expectations for a
second bottom, then it is possible to expect that the interest
rate path (hike) will move from the middle of 2011 close to the
beginning of 2011,"" said Vojtech Benda, a senior analyst ING
Commercial Banking said.
 But the U.S. Federal Reserve committed on Wednesday to buy
more government debt, which economists said could boost the
crown as investors ditch low-yielding assets in developed
economies for higher yields in emerging markets.
 This, some argued, spoke against any quick rate hikes, as
well as worries about the strength of the recovery and the
government's fiscal retrenchment.
 The bank called a news conference for 1330 GMT to spell out
reasons for the decision and give details of its updated staff
forecast.

 By David Milliken
 LONDON, Nov 4 (Reuters) - The Bank of England added no more
stimulus to the economy on Thursday after its November policy
meeting, seeming to want evidence of a sharper economic slowdown
before it considers the U.S. path of more quantitative easing.
 The BoE's decision contrasts with a move by the U.S. Federal
Reserve on Wednesday to buy $600 billion of bonds with new money
over the next eight months, after what it called
""disappointingly slow"" progress towards its economic targets.
 Economists had seen an outside chance the BoE might choose
to add to the 200 billion pounds ($322.7 billion) of assets
purchased between March 2009 and January this year, in a
pre-emptive move against the effects of hefty public spending
cuts due next year.
 But above-target inflation and robust third quarter growth
appear to have stayed the Monetary Policy Committee's hand for
now. This pushed sterling to a 9-month high against the dollar
 and taking gilt futures to a 3-day low .
 ""With inflation remaining well above target and higher VAT
from January next year likely to keep it there through 2011, the
BoE will be looking for clear signs that the recovery is
stalling before embarking on additional QE,"" said ING economist
James Knightley.
 The BoE's decision to keep rates at their record low of 0.5
percent had been anticipated by all 63 analysts in a Reuters
poll last week. The only analyst who had forecast more QE when
polled revised his call on Wednesday after firmer-than-expected
data from purchasing managers in the services sector.
 British inflation at 3.1 percent is 2 percentage points
higher than in the United States, and well above the BoE's 2
percent target, while the UK unemployment rate is 2 percentage
points lower.
 But there is a chance Britain's central bank may eventually
decide more stimulus is needed to shore up the economy against
deep government spending cuts, and a significant number of
analysts reckon that could come in February.
 ""Despite the MPC's no-change decision, I doubt that we will
have to wait much longer to see the launch of so-called 'QE2',""
said Roger Bootle, an economic advisor to accountants Deloitte.
 ""Further support is needed to see the economy through the
biggest government spending cuts in decades, with extra asset
purchases the only option left,"" Bootle said, adding that
government spending had added an average of 1 percent a year to
British output over the past decade.
 One Monetary Policy Committee member, Adam Posen, voted in
October for a 50 billion pounds expansion of the BoE's asset
purchase programme and is likely to have done the same this
month, while Andrew Sentance will probably have reiterated his
call for higher rates.
 Minutes to the Nov. 3-4 meeting published on Nov. 17 will
reveal whether either man was able to win broader support on the
MPC.
 ""Of key interest will be whether any of the other seven MPC
members came off the monetary policy fence. We suspect not,""
said Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight.

 * Fed sparks investor binge on world stocks
 * Emerging market debt in demand
 * Dollar weaker against major currencies
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Nov 4 (Reuters) - World stocks rose strongly,
touching new two-year highs, demand for emerging sovereign debt
increased and the dollar fell on Thursday as the afterglow of
the Federal Reserve's asset buying plan spread across markets.
 Wall Street looked set to join in the stock rally.
 The Fed on Wednesday said it would spend $600 billion buying
longer-term Treasury bonds through to the end of next June as
part of a renewed quantitative easing (QE) programme.
 This was a little more than expected, but not enough to
spook markets with worries about a worse-than-anticipated U.S.
economic picture.
 ""The result was slightly pleasantly surprising,"" said
Jonathan Schiessl, investment manager at wealth managers
Ashburton in Jersey. ""The risk trade is back on.""
 The trade, which has been running on and off since QE was
first anticipated in late August, essentially involves buying
emerging markets for their better growth prospects and potential
currency appreciation.
 But stocks in general also benefit because of the impact of
a huge wave of liquidity into the financial system.
 MSCI's all-country world stocks index was up 1.2 percent on
the day at new two-year highs and within reach of its levels
just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers. MSCI's emerging
market index gained 1.1 percent.
 Investors were also ploughing into traditionally more risky
emerging market sovereign debt. The yield spread between
emerging market debt and U.S. Treasuries as measured by JPMorgan
narrowed to levels last seen nearly three years ago.
 Developed market stocks were also much in demand. The
pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 was up 1.3 percent and Japan's
Nikkei closed up 2.17 percent.
 The move to QE also came as global manufacturing activity
has accelerated for the first time in six months, creating a
situation in which an already improving world economy has been
given a sharp monetary stimulus.

 DOLLAR DUMPED
 The main ""victim"" of QE is the U.S. dollar which is
effectively devalued by the printing of new money to buy the
$600 billion in assets.
 The dollar was down sharply, hitting a 28-year low versus
the high-yielding Australian dollar, and losing around three
quarters of a percent against a basket of major currencies.
 The Fed's commitment to purchases of Treasuries, implying
low funding costs, brought into focus an expected increased use
of the dollar in carry trades, in which the U.S. currency is
used to fund purchases in commodities, emerging markets and
higher-yielding currencies.
 The euro traded at $1.4226, up around 0.6 percent on the
day, having touched a nine-month high at $1.4243.
 Euro gains are being restrained by concerns over euro zone
debt, particularly in Ireland and Greece.
 Euro zone government bond yields rose as investors pondered
the impact of U.S. QE on inflation.

 Romanian inflation rose in September to 7.8 percent year-on-
year from 7.6 percent in August, mainly due to the impact of the
VAT hike, introduced in July to comply with terms of a 20
billion euro International Monetary Fund-led bailout.
 The bank held interest rates on Tuesday, suggesting
political uncertainties and price pressures meant
growth-boosting rate cuts might be further away than some

 * Malawi set to take the biggest hit
 * WHO says proposals are in the interests of public health
 
 By Ed Cropley and Kate Kelland
 JOHANNESBURG/LONDON, Nov 4 (Reuters) - An international push
to ban burley tobacco, a key ingredient in Marlboro and Lucky
Strike cigarettes, could threaten the livelihoods of 3.6 million
African tobacco workers, an industry body said on Thursday.
 The 170 countries and the European Union that have signed up
to the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Framework Convention on
Tobacco Control (FCTC) are to debate the ""guidelines"" to ban
burley at a meeting in Uruguay later this month.
 If approved, states will have to decide for themselves
whether to outlaw the variety, which goes into the ""American
blend"" cigarette tobacco preferred by smokers in most Western
markets.
 However, farmers' groups say it will have an immediate and
huge impact on demand for a crop that is vital to many poor
southern African countries -- most notably Malawi, where a third
of the economy and 70 percent of exports come from tobacco.
 ""For southern Africa, this would be a catastrophe,"" said
Antonio Abrunhosa, chief executive of the International Tobacco
Growers Association (ITGA). ""The biggest chunk of burley
production comes from Africa, especially Malawi,"" he said. 
 At a summit in Swaziland in September, the 19-country Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), voiced its
opposition to the mooted burley ban and said the WHO's thinking
about alternative crops was based on ""wrong assumptions"".
 Canada and Norway are leading the push for a burley ban as
part of a plan to make cigarettes taste less smooth, thereby
hoping to dent their attractiveness and help reduce the enormous
public health costs of smoking.
 While smoking rates are falling in U.S., Japan and western
Europe, they are still rising in much of the developing world
and health officials say this will cause a wave of cancer and
other chronic illnesses in coming decades that health systems in
poorer countries are ill-equipped to deal with.
 
 SMOKING COULD KILL A BILLION THIS CENTURY
 According to the WHO and the World Lung Foundation, smoking
currently kills around 5 million people a year worldwide and is
expected to kill a billion people this century if trends hold.
 ""The idea is to look into ingredients and to look at
restricting or inhibiting those which increase the
attractiveness of tobacco products,"" said Tarik Jasarevic, a
spokesman for the WHO's FCTC. ""Countries are working hard in the
best interests of public health.""
 Growers argue a burley ban would be likely to make a
difference only in rich countries that like ""American blends"".
 The WHO says it has noted the concerns of burley farmers,
and says the Uruguay meeting will also discuss ideas for
economically sustainable alternatives to growing tobacco.
 But the ITGA cites a study by South African consultancy NKC
Independent Economists that suggests a worst-case scenario of
3.6 million tobacco-related jobs being lost in nine African
countries.
 In Malawi, a country of 13 million people with one of the
world's heaviest HIV/AIDS burdens, the independent study says
700,000 farmers could go to the wall and the economy could
contract by 20 percent next year if burley demand disappeared.
Mozambique would lose 100,000 farmers, Uganda 77,000 and
Zimbabwe 55,000, it added.
 Abrunhosa said few of these farmers would have the means to
switch to growing other more capital-intensive tobaccos than
burley, and he argues there are no good substitute crops.
 ""The WHO lives on a different planet. It is not taking into
account the huge impact it will have on developing countries'
economies, especially in Africa,"" he said.
 Marlboro cigarettes are made by Philip Morris International
and Lucky Strike by British American Tobacco. Abrunhosa said
the ITGA had received ""some support"" from the tobacco industry
for its campaign against the burley ban.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Nov 4 (Reuters) - The dollar fell sharply on
Thursday, hitting a 28-year low versus the Australian dollar, as
a Federal Reserve decision to buy more U.S. government debt
triggered demand for risk and undermined the U.S. currency.
 The market concluded that the Fed's decision to buy $600
billion more in Treasuries by the middle of next year was in
line with expectations, spelling more dollar supply that would
be likely to weigh it down further.[ID:nFEDAHEAD]
 The Fed's commitment to open-ended purchases of Treasuries,
implying low funding costs, brings into focus an expected
increased use of the dollar in carry trades, in which the U.S.
currency is used to fund purchases in commodities, emerging
markets and higher-yielding currencies.
 As a result, the dollar slid to a 28-year low against the
higher-yielding Australian dollar and plumbed a fresh 10-month
trough against the euro.
 ""The risk now into year-end is that the dollar will go
lower, but I don't think the euro can go too much further due to
problems that still exist in the euro zone,"" said Tom Levinson,
currency strategist at ING.
 Levinson said the $1.43 area could act as a cap for the euro
and highlighted this weekend's Greek local elections as a
potential banana skin for the single currency.
 The euro  traded at $1.4237, up around 0.7 percent on
the day, having touched a nine-month high at $1.4243. Traders
reported an option barrier at $1.4250.
 The dollar index <=USD> <.DXY>, a gauge of its performance
against a basket of currencies, fell more than 0.7 percent to an
11-month low of 75.908, taking out trendline support from its
March 2008 lows.

following suit to trade up around 1.3 percent <.FTEU3>. U.S.

 The Australian dollar, whose central bank raised rates by 25
basis points to 4.75 percent this week, hit a post-float high
above $1.0099 , with the New Zealand dollar rallying to
its highest since mid-2008 at $0.7896 .
 The dollar fell 0.2 percent against the yen, easing to 80.90
yen per dollar  and still close to its 1995 postwar record
low of 79.75 yen. A major Asian sovereign account was a seller
in European trade.
 For dollar/yen, the key issue would be to see how far the
Fed's bond purchases pushed down U.S. yields.
 ""If they push down U.S. yields in the belly of the curve
then it could create downward pressure on the dollar/yen,"" said
Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist Japan at Barclays.
 Yields on medium-term Treasuries fell after the Fed decision
on the view they would benefit most from the bond purchase
programme, while 30-year yields jumped in a sharp curve
steepening.
 Still, traders remain on alert for possible yen-selling
intervention by Japanese authorities to weaken the yen.
 The Bank of Japan meets on Nov. 4-5, having brought forward
its policy review from mid-November to speed up the launch of a
5 trillion yen ($62 billion) asset buying scheme.
 Analysts had said the timing of the meeting gave the BOJ the
chance to act quickly if the Fed surprised the market and
triggered a new wave of dollar selling.
 The European Central Bank, meeting on Thursday, was not
expected to show any signs of veering off its crisis exit path,
but there was an outside chance of more quantitative easing by
the Bank of England. [ID:nLDE6A00KZ] [ID:nLDE6A00ZO]

 * Service sector backlogs of work falls
 * Firms hire fewer new workers in October than month before
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Growth in the euro zone's dominant
service sector slowed down last month, with Germany still in the
fast lane but many smaller economies just chugging along, key
private sector business surveys showed on Thursday.
 The Markit Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers' Index
(PMI), which monitors the performance of thousands of companies
ranging from banks to hotels, fell in October to an eight-month
low of 53.3 from 54.1 in September.
 While that was revised up slightly from a flash estimate of
53.2 and still well above the 50 mark that divides growth and
contraction, the survey showed activity was likely supported by
a reduction in backlogs of work.
 ""The recovery also remains all too dependent upon France and
Germany, and the steep slowing in the rate of expansion in
France is therefore a concern,"" said Chris Williamson at Markit.
 ""Spain's problems seem to be escalating, with its service
sector falling deeper back into recession.""
 Earlier data showed French service sector growth slowed
dramatically last month and Italy's slowed as well.
 But in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, the pace of growth
accelerated on stronger client demand and improved conditions in
the wider economy.
 The euro zone composite PMI, a broader measure of private
sector activity that combines both the services and the
manufacturing PMI which on Tuesday showed a fall, slipped to an
eight-month low in October of 53.8 from 54.1 in September.
 The flash reading was slightly lower, at 53.4.
 Survey compiler Markit said the composite PMI data suggested
quarterly euro zone economic growth of 0.3 percent, down from
0.6 percent in the third quarter and a peak of 1 percent in the
second quarter.
 WORKING DOWN BACKLOGS
 The report showed, however, that a significant contributor
to growth in the past month came from working down existing
orders rather than meeting new ones.
 The service sector backlog of work index fell below 50 for
the first time since the start of the year, down to 48.8 last
month from 51.6 in September.
 ""The fact that this growth was partly achieved through
backlogs of orders falling for the first time in nine months
suggests that firms are struggling to maintain activity levels
in the face of weakened inflows of new orders,"" Williamson said.
 ""If this continues, firms are likely to consider job cuts,
meaning employment in the sector could soon start falling
again.""
 The composite employment index fell further last month,
slipping to 51.1 from September's 51.4, indicating firms were
taking on new workers at the slowest pace since June.
 Data released last week showed euro zone unemployment rose
to 10.1 percent in September from a downwardly revised 10
percent in August despite a fall in the number of jobless in the
euro zone's biggest economy Germany.

 By Alistair Scrutton
 NEW DELHI, Nov 4 (Reuters) - A weakened U.S. President
Barack Obama visits India this week to counter perceptions he
has relegated the Asian power behind rivals China and Pakistan,
but he may struggle to seal deals to help usher in billions of
dollars of business.
 Economic ties are booming but Obama's visit from Saturday
to Monday may fail to live up to President Bill Clinton's 2000
trip that helped break the diplomatic ice, or President George
W. Bush's visit in 2006 when a civil nuclear deal was hailed as
a landmark in ties.
 Obama's drubbing in the mid-term elections may also tie his
political hands when it comes to bold policy moves on India as
growing worries emerge that outsourcing in cities such as IT
hub Bangalore is worsening mass unemployment in the United
States.
 It was a sign of the times that Obama told the Press Trust
of India that India should open up its markets to U.S.
companies, a stance that may dominate a 10-day trip of Asia
aimed at boosting U.S. exports and jobs, crucial for his
presidency's fate.
 ""Obama is going to be too preoccupied domestically, and you
won't see a more aggressive foreign policy going forward,"" said
Amitabh Mattoo, professor of international politics at
Jawaharlal Nehru University.
 ""On his upcoming trip, I think that the best India can hope
for is a consolidation of the relationship established under
President Bush.""
 An increasingly confident India wants recognition of its
global weight. It wants a permanent seat on the U.N. Security
Council and for the United States to allow exports of dual-use
technology, banned after India's nuclear tests in 1998.
 India's booming trillion-dollar economy is one of the few a
stars in a struggling world economy, offering U.S. investors
massive opportunities. There are reportedly more than 200
executives accompanying Obama on his visit to Mumbai and Delhi.
 On the agenda will be lucrative defence ties. The United
States has held more military exercises with India in the past
year than any other country, and U.S. firms Boeing and Lockheed
Martin Corp are bidding for a $11 billion deal for 126 fighter
jets.
 NO BIG BREAKTHROUGHS
 A bilateral trade boom has seen total flows treble to $36.5
billion in goods in the decade to 2009-10, but the United
States slipped from number one to three in India's trade
partners. India lags China, the United States' third-biggest
trading partner.
 Washington faces a host of hurdles, including Indian
worries that signing defence pacts -- which are necessary for
the U.S. arms sales to go through -- may land New Delhi in a
wider entanglement with the U.S. military.
 The civil nuclear deal with the United States was signed to
great fanfare, but it struggled through parliament and now the
accord has sparked criticism that U.S. companies in the sector
will be discouraged to invest due to high liabilities.
 Obama has already played down ending a ban on U.S. exports
of dual-use technology, telling the Press Trust of India it was
""very difficult and complicated"" to meet Indian expectations.
 Obama may offer some support for India's place for a
permanent seat on the U.N Security Council, but he will likely
step short of a full endorsement.
 ""It will be the opportunity to consolidate all that we have
built in the past decade,"" Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao was
quoted as saying in the Indian Express. ""We are not in a stage
in our relationship for dramatic breakthroughs and big-bang.""
 For its part, India will be wary of perceptions it is
putting its eggs into one U.S. basket despite Obama's personal
ties with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Any sign of India's
sovereignty being undermined can rally political opposition
against Singh.
 Singh leads a coalition of fickle regional allies and his
Congress Party has had its roots in statist and non-alignment
policies since independence in 1947, policy vestiges that still
remain among some of its most powerful politicians.
 Singh toured east Asia in October before Obama and
announced he would be meeting the Chinese premier in India in
December.
 In the absence of a Doha trade deal, India spread its wing
to negotiating trade deals with the likes of the European Union
and, in a mark of economic power moving from west to east, the
ASEAN bloc of Southeast Asian nations, Japan and Malaysia.
 ""India will never put all its eggs in one basket, although
the U.S may be the biggest basket of all,"" said Naresh Chandra,
a former Indian envoy to Washington.
 India's reluctance to embrace Washington further was
perhaps hindered by Obama's first year, when there was a
perception his administration was focused more on shoring up a
chaotic Pakistan or dealing with China's rise than getting
close to the world's largest democracy.
 Early campaign talk from Obama that disputed Kashmir should
be discussed as part of a wider thrust to bring peace to
Afghanistan and Pakistan sparked a storm of criticism in India.
He later backed down on the idea.
 ""Past projects remain incomplete, few new ideas have been
embraced by both sides, and the forward momentum that
characterised recent cooperation has subsided,"" the Center for
a New American Security said in a report.
 ""There remains a sense among observers in both countries
that this critical relationship is falling short of its
promise. (Additional reporting by Henry Foy and Matthias

kept the hunt on for growth and higher yields.
 European stock futures were up across the board, with the
STOXX Europe 50 futures up 1.1 percent in early trade.
 Japanese equities rose 2 percent and led the region after
fears of a much stronger yen in the wake of the Fed decision
were eased by a moderate market reaction, prompting foreign
investors to cover their bets against stocks.
 After falling overnight, the U.S. dollar stabilised, with
dealers hesitant to add to sizable bets against the currency
after the euro touched a 10-month high, though traders pushed
up copper and oil prices anyway.
 There was still a plethora of events coming up this week
that could inject volatility into asset markets, including
policy meetings of the Bank of England, Bank of Japan and
European Central Bank as well as the October U.S. payrolls
report.
 For Asia, after the Fed pledged to buy $600 billion of
mostly mid-maturity Treasury debt, increased capital flows into
the region will probably accelerate a process of reflation but
also heighten the risk of more stringent capital controls.
 ""By undertaking more Treasury bond purchases, the hope is
that risk appetite will provide the catalyst for people to
spend, particularly corporates,"" Sean Darby, Asia strategist
with Nomura in Hong Kong, said in a note.
 ""We expect Asian equities to remain well bid but the
additional QE will raise the spectre of capital controls in
ASEAN and parts of North Asia.""
 Japan's Nikkei share average was up 1.9 percent, with
shares of big exporters among the biggest lifts to the index
after the yen sold off overnight.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan rose
1.1 percent, led by the commodity and technology sectors.
 Since September when speculation grew the Fed would have to
print more cheap money and a chunk of those dollars would come
to high-growth Asia, the index has risen 19 percent, exceeding
returns on the MSCI all-country world index of 15 percent.
 Hong Kong's stock market remained electric this week, with
the Hang Seng up 1 percent on the day and extending gains so
far this week to 5.6 percent compared with returns of 3.6
percent on the MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan index.
 COPPER, CRUDE OIL GAIN
 In currency markets, many dealers did not want to upset a
weak U.S. dollar trend already in place before the Fed meeting,
but quickly found other themes on which to trade.
 The Canadian dollar was a big mover, with the U.S. dollar
climbing 0.2 percent to C$1.0066 after the Canadian government
surprised markets by blocking BHP Billiton's $39 billion bid
for Potash Corp.
 The euro was at $1.4130, largely unchanged on the day,
after hitting a high around $1.4175 on Wednesday.
 Some investors were beginning to reassess the risks of
keeping such negative bets on the dollar after the Fed decision
was largely in line with expectations.
 For example, fund managers at Edmond de Rothschild Asset
Management said they were maintaining their short euro versus
the dollar position after the Fed news.
 ""After rallying so strongly in the recent past, risky
assets might inspire more caution. This would benefit the USD
and provide overall protection for our positions,"" the firm
said in a note.
 Economic reflation trades were rampant in the commodities
market, with three-month copper traded on the London Metal
Exchange up 1.4 percent to $8,440.00 a tonne, creeping back
toward a two-year high reached last week.
 Crude prices were poised for a fourth day of gains, up 1
percent on the day at $85.53 a barrel.
 Ten-year U.S. Treasury futures rose 0.5 percent to a
one-month high, while in the cash market, 5-year Treasury
yields slipped 3 basis points to 1.08 percent, with 43 percent
of the Fed's new plans for bond buying falling between 4 and 7
year maturities.

 By Gwladys Fouche
 OSLO, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Norway's sovereign wealth fund has
agreed to buy a 25 percent stake in the UK Crown Estate's Regent
Street properties in London for 448 million pounds ($719
million), the Norwegian central bank said on Thursday.
 The acquisition is the first property investment for the
fund, which has been allowed since March to invest as much as 5
percent of its assets in real estate through a corresponding
decrease in fixed-income investments.
 The Regent Street properties, 113 buildings spread over 39
blocks, are a major shopping district in the heart of London
named after the Prince Regent, later to become King George IV,
with the architecture dating from the early 19th century.
 It is owned by The Crown Estate on behalf of the United
Kingdom.
 The Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global is the world's
second-largest sovereign wealth fund, with about $500 billion in
assets. It saves Norway's oil and gas revenues for when the oil
runs out.
 ""A move into real estate will strengthen the fund, which
today is solely invested in stocks and bonds,"" said Yngve
Slyngstad, chief executive officer of the fund.
 The fund said it planned to invest mainly in unlisted real
estate properties, well-developed property markets and
traditional property types, initially in Europe.

(Adds comments from another c.bank adviser, paragraphs 4-6)
 BEIJING, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Unbridled printing of dollars is
the biggest risk to the global economy, an adviser to the
Chinese central bank said in comments published on Thursday, a
day after the Federal Reserve unveiled a new round of monetary
easing.
 China must set up a firewall via currency policy and
capital controls to cushion itself from external shocks, Xia
Bin said in a commentary piece in the Financial News, a
Chinese-language newspaper managed by the central bank.
 ""As long as the world exercises no restraint in issuing
global currencies such as the dollar -- and this is not easy --
then the occurrence of another crisis is inevitable, as quite a
few wise Westerners lament,"" he said.
 Li Daokui, another academic adviser to the central bank,
said loose money in the United States would translate into
additional pressure on the Chinese yuan to appreciate.
 ""A certain amount of capital will flow into China, either
through Hong Kong or directly into the mainland,"" Li said.
 But he added that Beijing would stick to its own gradual
pace in managing the yuan's rise. He also said that big gains
in U.S. midterm elections by Republicans, who are seen as more
friendly to free trade, had made him ""a bit relieved"" because
political calls for China to let the yuan rise would likely
quiet down.
 The Federal Reserve launched a fresh effort on Wednesday to
support the struggling U.S. economy, committing to buy $600
billion in government bonds despite concerns the programme
could do more harm than good.
 Policymakers from emerging market powerhouses in Latin
America and Asia said they would come up with fresh measures to
curb capital inflows following the Fed policy.
 Wang Zihong, a U.S.-focused economist at the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, a top government think tank, said
the U.S. quantitative easing could add to inflationary concerns
in China.
 ""It will put pressure on the dollar to weaken, thus pushing
up global commodity prices, including oil. So it will increase
imported inflation pressure in some countries, including
China,"" he said.
 WHAT IS GOOD FOR US?
 But Wang dismissed suggestions that China might sell some
of its vast stock of U.S. Treasuries as a way of punishing the
United States and cutting Beijing's exposure to dollars.
 ""This is an emotional proposal. What will China buy after
selling Treasuries? Do we have any idea? No, we are unable to
think out an idea,"" Wang said.
 Xia, the central bank adviser, said that it will take a
long time for the global monetary system to improve and that
China must be ready to hold the line on its currency policy and
capital controls.
 ""We must keep a clear mind. We must not lead the world in
financial regulation, nor simply follow the deeds of mature
economies. We must think 'what is good for us',"" he said.
 China already has a regime of tight capital controls in
place, limiting its vulnerability to the wave of liquidity that
analysts say could be pushed towards emerging markets by easier
U.S. monetary policy.
 By closely managing the yuan's exchange rate, Beijing has
also been able to blunt appreciation pressure in the face of a
weakening dollar.
 To better coordinate its policies, China should establish a
team in charge of broad economic and financial supervision
above its current network of financial regulators, Xia said.
 As an academic adviser on the central bank's monetary
policy committee, Xia does not have decision-making powers but
does provide input to the policy-making process.

 * Aussie pauses after fresh 28-year high, euro 10-mth peak
 * ECB, BoE meeting outcomes next in focus
 By Masayuki Kitano and Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, Nov 4 (Reuters) - The dollar held near recent lows
against the euro and Australian dollar on Thursday after dropping
following a Federal Reserve decision to buy more government debt,
and it edged back down towards a 1995 record low on the yen.
 The market concluded that the Fed's decision to buy $600
billion more in Treasuries by the middle of next year was
ultimately in line with expectations, spelling more dollar supply
that would be likely to weigh it down further.
 The Fed's commitment to open-ended purchases of Treasuries,
implying low funding costs for a while, also plays into carry
trades, in which the dollar is used to fund purchases into
commodities, emerging markets and higher-yielding currencies.
 As as result, the dollar remained close to a 28-year low hit
against the higher-yielding Australian dollar after the Fed
decision and not far off a 10-month trough against the euro at
$1.4200.
 The dollar index, a gauge of its performance against a basket
of currencies, eased 0.1 percent to 76.31, just above its 2010
low set in October at 76.144 and trendline support at 76.10.
 ""We're still seeing buyers of Asian currencies as well so the
continued dollar weakness story still holds,"" said Robert Reilly,
co-Head of flow fixed income and currencies at Societe Generale
CIB in Hong Kong.
 Asian share markets rose on Thursday and metal prices
rallied, while gold futures jumped more than 1 percent.
 The Australian dollar, whose central bank raised rates by 25
basis points to 4.75 percent this week, hit a post-float high
above $1.0060 after the Fed decision before pulling back to
$1.0059 on Thursday.
 The dollar fell 0.3 percent against the yen, which
strengthened on the crosses after falling on the Fed decision,
and it eased back below 81.00 yen per dollar, taking it within
range of its 1995 postwar record low of 79.75 yen.
 A trader said it was falling on selling by Japanese banks,
possibly reflecting orders from Japanese exporters.
 For dollar/yen, the key issue would be to see how far the
Fed's bond purchases actually pushed down U.S. yields.
 ""If they push down U.S. yields in the belly of the curve then
it could create downward pressure on the dollar/yen,"" said
Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist Japan at Barclays.
 Medium-term Treasury yields fell after the Fed decision on
the view they would benefit most from the bond purchase
programme, while 30-year yields jumped in a sharp steepening of
the curve.
 Still, traders remain on alert for possible yen-selling
intervention by Japanese authorities to weaken the yen.
 The Bank of Japan meets on Nov. 4-5, having brought
forward its policy review from mid-November to speed up the
launch of its 5 trillion yen ($62 billion) asset buying scheme.
 Analysts had said the timing of the meeting gave the BOJ the
chance to act quickly if the Fed surprised the market and
triggered a new wave of dollar selling.
 Koji Fukaya, chief currency strategist at Credit Suisse
Securities in Tokyo, expected the Bank of Japan to stand pat on
Friday, however.
 He said the dollar could see a correctional bounce ahead of
the year-end due to the potential for short-dollar position
unwinding, and was likely to trade in a range between 80 yen to
82 yen as it found support towards the year-end.
 The euro, which hit 10-month highs at $1.4200 after the Fed
decision, was unchanged from late U.S. trade at $1.4139.
 Chartwise, it is seen as having scope to rise to $1.4375, a
76.4 percent retracement of its fall from above $1.5140 late last
year to its June low of $1.1876.
 The European Central Bank meets on Thursday. The ECB is not
expected to show any signs of veering off its crisis exit path,
but there is an outside chance of more quantitative easing by the
Bank of England.
 Sterling hit a peak at $1.6180 on Wednesday, a high last seen
in late January, before easing back to $1.6126.
 ""We may be in for a period of consolidation. We've got the
ECB and Bank of England meetings tonight, so we'll see how
those pan out. In the more medium term, for the dollar to
regain a stronger tone you'll need to see the jobs data,"" said
Grant Turley, a strategist at ANZ in Sydney.
 On Friday, the influential non-farm payrolls data is
expected to show the U.S. economy generated 60,000 jobs in
October.

 * Won't comment directly on policy, post-Fed market move
 * BOJ kicks off rescheduled two-day rate review ending Friday
 * BOJ likely to keep policy on hold with yen gains subdued
 By Leika Kihara and Rie Ishiguro
 TOKYO, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Inflexible currency regimes
maintained by emerging economies may delay necessary adjustments
in global imbalances, Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa
said on Thursday.
 Shirakawa also warned that Japan's economy will experience
some slowdown in exports and output ahead, suggesting the central
bank will keep monetary conditions loose and consider further
easing if risks to growth increase.
 The BOJ starts its two-day meeting later on Thursday and many
analysts expect the central bank to keep policy settings
unchanged after the Federal Reserve's monetary easing the day
before broadly met expectations and had little impact on the yen.
 ""Japan's economy appears to be heading toward a moderate
recovery. But improvements are weakening due to slowing growth in
exports and output,"" Shirakawa told a seminar before attending
the BOJ's rate review.
 The Japanese central bank pushed forward its meeting from
mid-November to speed up the launch of its 5-trillion-yen ($61.88
billion) asset buying scheme announced early last month.
 The governor did not comment directly on the outlook for
monetary policy or market moves following the Fed's announcement
that it would buy $600 billion in government debt to support a
struggling U.S. economy.
 Shirakawa said the difference between sluggish growth in rich
economies, which are still struggling with balance sheet
adjustments, and fast-growing emerging nations was heightening
uncertainty over the global economic outlook.
 ""If currency rates, which serve as a means for adjusting
imbalances, lack flexibility, that could delay necessary
adjustments"" he said.
 The United States and European countries have criticised
Beijing for keeping its currency, the yuan, artificially low to
give the country's exports an unfair trade advantage.
 China and other emerging countries, in turn, have blamed
extremely loose monetary policies in advanced economies for
triggering a flood of capital into their economies and pushing up
their currencies.
 Group of 20 finance leaders last month agreed on the need to
reduce ""persistently large"" current account surpluses and
deficits, but failed to agree on specific targets as a percentage
of gross domestic product.
 The topic will likely gain centre stage this weekend when
APEC finance leaders gather in Japan and next week, when G20
leaders hold a summit in South Korea.

 * Boasts another hefty trade surplus on high commodity
prices
 * RBA focused on trade boom, tightening bias still in place
 By Wayne Cole
 SYDNEY, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Australian retail sales rose a
modest 0.3 percent in September while inflation-adjusted sales
undershot expectations by some way, suggesting consumption
added less to economic growth than many had hoped.
 Yet, other data out Thursday showed the country recorded
its sixth straight sizeable trade surplus in September at $1.76
billion ($1.76 billion), a boon to profits, investment and
jobs.
 The surge in export earnings this year is a major reason
the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) raised rates to 4.75
percent this week in a pre-emptive strike against inflationary
pressures.
 ""It's all about a massive positive shock coming through
from the terms of trade extending to investment spending,"" said
Stephen Roberts, an economist at Nomura. ""The RBA is looking
forward, not backward.""
 Interbank futures continue to imply only a slender chance
of another hike as soon as December, and about a 30 pct chance
of a move at the RBA's following meeting in February.
 The Australian dollar dipped on the soft sales number,
though it was still above parity to the U.S. dollar, having
earlier touched a 28-year peak of $1.0064.
 The U.S. currency took a beating after the Federal Reserve
announced a fresh burst of stimulus on Wednesday as it
struggles with high unemployment and the risk of deflation.
 That was a stark contrast to the RBA which has lifted rates
seven times in the past year as a once-in-a-century boom in
export earnings and investment could fuel future inflation.
 Voracious Asian demand for Australia's resource exports led
to huge price increases for iron ore and coal which have put an
end to years of trade deficits. Since April, the country has
racked up a total trade surplus of A$12.6 billion.
 DEMAND HIGH ABROAD, LESS AT HOME
 The outlook for demand remains positive with figures
earlier this week showing China's massive manufacturing sector
sped up in September, with India not far behind. China is
Australia's largest single export market, taking over 70
percent of its iron ore, while India is a major buyer of coal.
 ""Early indications are of firmer benchmark commodity prices
next quarter and thus sustained high levels of the terms of
trade,"" said Michael Turner, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
 ""As business investment ramps up over 2011 and draws on
scarce labour, the case remains for further action by the RBA
through 2011,"" he added
 The run of rate hikes has taken a toll on some sectors of
the economy, with home building subsiding and house prices
cooling.
 The consumer has also been more cautious, paying off loans
and cutting back on some discretionary spending. Thursday's
figures showed retail sales rose 0.3 percent in September from
August, when the market had looked for a 0.4 percent increase.
 For a graphic on sales see: http://link.reuters.com/myf73q
 When adjusted for inflation, sales for the third quarter
were up only 0.7 percent from the previous quarter to A$60.16
billion, well below the 1.1 percent increase expected.
Since retail sales account for around 23 percent of
Australia's gross domestic product (GDP), that subdued result
could lead analysts to trim forecasts for economic growth.
""That takes the sheen off Q3 GDP -- it means we could be
looking at growth of 0.6 or 0.7 percent rather than 0.9 percent
or more,"" said Brian Redican, a senior economist at Macquarie.
 ""Of course, the RBA wants the consumer to be subdued, so
this won't bother them.""
 The RBA has long been counting on consumers to spend less
and save more to make room for mining investment to boom
without creating inflation.

the Hang Seng up 1 percent on the day and extending gains so
far this week to 5.6 percent compared with returns of 3.6

 In currency markets, many dealers did not want to upset a
weak U.S. dollar trend already in place before the Fed meeting,
but quickly found other themes on which to trade.
 The Canadian dollar was a big mover, with the U.S. dollar
climbing 0.3 percent to C$1.0076 after the Canadian government

policy meetings of the Bank of England, Bank of Japan and
European Central Bank as well as the October U.S. payrolls
report.

 For Asia, after the Fed pledged to buy $600 billion of
mostly mid-maturity Treasury debt, increased capital flows into
the region will probably accelerate a process of reflation but
also heighten the risk of more stringent capital controls.
 ""By undertaking more Treasury bond purchases, the hope is
that risk appetite will provide the catalyst for people to
spend, particularly corporates,"" Sean Darby, Asia strategist
with Nomura in Hong Kong, said in a note.
 ""We expect Asian equities to remain well bid but the
additional QE will raise the spectre of capital controls in
ASEAN and parts of North Asia.""
 Japan's Nikkei share average was up 1.9 percent <.N225>,
with shares of big exporters among the biggest lifts to the
index after the yen sold off overnight.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan rose
1.1 percent <.MIAPJ0000PUS>, led by the commodity and
technology sectors.
 Since September when speculation grew the Fed would have to
print more cheap money and a chunk of those dollars would come
to high-growth Asia, the index has risen 19 percent, exceeding
returns on the MSCI all-country world index of 15 percent.
 Hong Kong's stock market remained electric this week, with
the Hang Seng up 1 percent on the day <.HSI> and extending
gains so far this week to 5.6 percent compared with returns of
3.6 percent on the MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan index.
 COPPER, CRUDE OIL GAIN
 In currency markets, many dealers did not want to upset a
weak U.S. dollar trend already in place before the Fed meeting,
but quickly found other themes on which to trade.
 The Canadian dollar was a big mover, with the U.S. dollar
climbing 0.2 percent to C$1.0066 after the Canadian government
surprised markets by blocking BHP Billiton's  
$39 billion bid for Potash Corp . [ID:nN03272751]
 The euro was at $1.4130 , largely unchanged on the
day, after hitting a high around $1.4175 on Wednesday.
 Some investors were beginning to reassess the risks of
keeping such negative bets on the dollar after the Fed decision
was largely in line with expectations.
 For example, fund managers at Edmond de Rothschild Asset
Management said they were maintaining their short euro versus
the dollar position after the Fed news.
 ""After rallying so strongly in the recent past, risky
assets might inspire more caution. This would benefit the USD
and provide overall protection for our positions,"" the firm
said in a note.
 Economic reflation trades were rampant in the commodities
market, with three-month copper traded on the London Metal
Exchange up 1.4 percent to $8,440.00 a tonne , creeping
back toward a two-year high reached last week.
 Crude prices were poised for a fourth day of gains, up 1
percent on the day at $85.53 a barrel .
 Ten-year U.S. Treasury futures rose 0.5 percent to a
one-month high , while in the cash market, 5-year
Treasury yields  slipped 3 basis points to 1.08
percent, with 43 percent of the Fed's new plans for bond buying
falling between 4 and 7 year maturities.

By Ian Chua and Masayuki Kitano
 SYDNEY/TOKYO, Nov 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was on the
back foot on Thursday after the Federal Reserve launched a
controversial policy to buy more government debt, hovering near
its 2010 low against a basket of currencies and a 28-year trough
against the Australian dollar.
 The Fed said on Wednesday it would buy $600 billion more in
Treasuries by the middle of next year in an attempt to
reinvigorate a flagging recovery, slightly more than the $500
billion markets were generally positioned for.
 The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performance
against a basket of currencies, was holding at 76.41 after
falling 0.4 percent on Wednesday, just above its 2010 low set in
October at 76.144 and trendline support at 76.10.
 The euro, which hit 10-month highs at $1.4200 on trading
platform EBS after the Fed decision, stood at $1.4121 from around
$1.4000 before the announcement.
 ""Setting aside the immediate reaction in the FX market, we
expect that this will ultimately prove to be bearish for the
USD against other currencies and against a broad basket of
commodities,"" analysts at JPMorgan said in a note to clients.
 Analysts expect investors to take the Fed's commitment to
open-ended purchases of Treasuries as a green light to use the
dollar as a funding vehicle for carry trades into commodities,
emerging markets and higher-yielding currencies.
 The dollar softened to 81.02 yen after rising as far as 81.59
on Wednesday.
 The all-time low of 79.95 yen was still in focus and
traders remained on alert for possible yen-selling intervention
by Japanese authorities to weaken its currency.
 The Bank of Japan meets on Nov. 4-5, having brought
forward its policy review from mid-November to speed up the
launch of its 5 trillion yen ($62 billion) asset buying scheme.
 Analysts had said the timing of the meeting gave the BOJ the
chance to act quickly if the Fed surprised the market and
triggered a new wave of dollar selling.
 Koji Fukaya, chief currency strategist at Credit Suisse
Securities in Tokyo, said he expected the Bank of Japan to stand
pat on Friday, however.
 He said the dollar could see a correctional bounce ahead of
the year-end due to the potential for position unwinding, and was
likely to trade in a range between 80 yen to 82 yen as it found
support towards the year-end.
 The dollar has lost nearly 8.0 percent versus a basket of
major currencies since September on expectations that
more monetary easing from the Fed would pressure U.S. yields
and diminish the return on dollar-denominated assets.
 Medium-term U.S. Treasury debt yields fell on views they
would benefit most from the Fed bond purchase programme, while
30-year yields jumped in a sharp steepening of the curve.
 With the Fed out of the way, there is still plenty this week
for markets to chew on.
 On Friday, the influential non-farm payrolls data is
expected to show the U.S. economy generated 60,000 jobs in
October.
 Before that however, the European Central Bank meets on
Thursday. The ECB is not expected to show any signs
of veering off its crisis exit path, but there is an outside
chance of more quantitative easing from the Bank of England.
 Sterling hit a peak at $1.6180 on Wednesday, highs last seen
in late January, before easing back to $1.6093.
 ""We may be in for a period of consolidation. We've got the
ECB and Bank of England meetings tonight, so we'll see how
those pan out. In the more medium term, for the dollar to
regain a stronger tone, you'll need to see the jobs data,"" said
Grant Turley, strategist at ANZ in Sydney.
 The Australian dollar was one of the main beneficiaries of
renewed dollar weakness, hitting a post-float high above $1.0060
before pulling back to $1.0031.
 ""We still favour those (like the Canadian, Australian and
New Zealand dollars) where upward pressure on interest rates
will increase as downside global economic risks abate,"" said
Kit Juckes, strategist at Societe Generale.

 * Threat of lost support in heartland too big to ignore
 * Harper has masterful record of staying in power
 By David Ljunggren
 OTTAWA, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Canada let politics trump the
business community's interests when it rejected a foreign bid
for Potash Corp  on Wednesday and instead put efforts
to stay in power at the top of the government's agenda.
 The decision to block Anglo-Australian mining giant BHP
Billiton 's $39 billion bid came as a surprise, given
how methodically Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his
government have broadcast a pro-business, anti-protectionist
message.
 Yet regardless of the damage that vetoing the bid could do
to Canada's reputation in the international business community,
Harper preferred to neutralize political pressures ahead of an
election expected in the first half of next year.
 Industry Minister Tony Clement insisted the decision was
his, but Harper's famously tight control over government means
he certainly had significant impact on the decision.
 Killing the bid removes two political obstacles for the
minority Conservative government.
 It sidelines two opposition parties, who wanted a ""no"" vote
and would have used approval as a campaign weapon.
 And it helps maintain support for the Conservatives in
their heartland in the west of Canada.
 Harper was clearly taken aback by ferocious opposition from
the ruling Saskatchewan Party in the Prairie province of
Saskatchewan, where Potash is based. The party shares its roots
with the federal Conservatives and is usually very friendly.
 The 13 federal Conservative legislators from Saskatchewan
also began to worry. Had even a few of them lost their seats in
the next election, it could have made a difference between
Harper maintaining or losing power.
 Harper, in power since early 2006, knows the pitfalls of
crossing a friendly provincial leader.
 In the run-up to the 2008 election, the populist premier of
Newfoundland and Labrador was so angry with Harper about a
dispute over oil revenues that he urged the province to vote
against the federal Conservatives. Support for the party
collapsed and it lost all of its three seats in the province.
 Few believe that Saskatchewan premier Brad Wall -- the most
vociferous opponent of the deal -- would have taken such a
dramatic step, given his close ties with Harper.
 But a tepid backing for the Conservatives from Wall in the
next election could have had a political price.
 The affair could also have become a national unity issue --
always a sensitive concept in a country which has spent three
decades trying to deal with separatists in French-speaking
Quebec, one of five provinces worried about the BHP bid.
 Harper is a masterful political operator who exceeded all
expectations after coming to power in early 2006 with a weak
minority government, which relied on the support of opposition
legislators to pass budgets and survive confidence votes.
 He has used guile, skill and threats to stay in power and
twice had Parliament shut down to avoid the threat of defeat.
 Yet he remained vulnerable to opposition campaigns to paint
him as arrogant and controlling, and he never attracted the
support of enough Canadians to make a majority win likely.
 Blocking the BHP bid may improve his short-term chances of
staying in office.

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Global equities rose modestly,
with the Dow and Nasdaq at levels not seen since 2008, while
the dollar fell on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said it
would buy $600 billion more in government bonds by mid-2011 in
an attempt to boost the anemic U.S. economy.
 The December futures contract for the Nikkei 225 stock
index <0#NK:> trading in Chicago fell 5 points to 9,305.
 On Wednesday afternoon, longer-dated U.S. government bond
prices fell sharply and commodities rose as the dollar's value
weakened before the Fed's decision to buy Treasuries in a move
seen as ""printing money."" A flood of dollars on the market
debases the currency's value.
 ""All in all, it means more dollars. The debt's going to
expand. It should lead to a weaker dollar,"" said Sterling
Smith, an analyst at Country Hedging Inc, in Minnesota.
 ""In general, it's going to be bullish for all commodities.
Any commodity that has a good fundamental story is going to
have legs on this.""
 The decision, which takes the Fed into largely uncharted
waters, is aimed at further lowering borrowing costs for
consumers and businesses still suffering in the aftermath of
the worst recession since the Great Depression.
 The U.S. central bank said it would buy about $75 billion
in longer-term Treasury bonds per month. It said it would
regularly review the pace and size of the program, and adjust
it as needed, depending on the recovery's path.
 In its post-meeting statement, the Fed described the
economy as ""slow,"" and said employers remained reluctant to add
to payrolls. It said measures of inflation were ""somewhat
low.""
 ""I don't think the Fed overdelivered. Strictly speaking,
$75 billion a month is less than $100 billion,"" said Richard
Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac in New
York.
 ""Some were suggesting that the Fed may change the 'extended
period' language into an even more extended period, but the Fed
didn't,"" Franulovich added. ""And beyond June, there's nothing,
there is no outlook. I am slightly underwhelmed. The dollar did
sell off, but I don't think this spike in the euro has legs.""
 The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, with the
U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> down 0.51 percent at 76.333.
 The euro  rose 0.69 percent to $1.4134 after briefly
hitting a session peak of $1.42 immediately after the Fed's
announcement.
 But the greenback remained higher against the Japanese yen
in volatile trading after the Fed's statement. The dollar
 gained 0.62 percent to 81.12.
 DOW HIGHEST SINCE SEPTEMBER 2008
 U.S. stocks ended higher in volatile trade after the Fed's
statement as analysts had already priced in an injection of
around $500 billion by the Fed.
 The Dow closed at its highest since late September 2008.
In perspective, September 2008 is remembered on Wall Street as
a painful month, when the credit crisis deepened and Lehman
Brothers filed for bankruptcy.
On Wednesday, the Nasdaq finished at its highest mark since
June 2008, while the S&P 500 ended at a six-month high.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 26.41
points, or 0.24 percent, to end at 11,215.13. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose 4.39 points, or 0.37 percent, to
finish at 1,197.96. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> gained
6.75 points, or 0.27 percent, to close at 2,540.27 -- just off
its intraday high at 2,541.42.
 ""The Republican victory and quantitative easing are both
net positives for the market,"" said Alec Young, equity
strategist at S&P Equity Research in New York.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> edged up 0.1
percent to 319.60. Earlier, the index had risen intraday to as
high as 320.53, bringing gains this year to about 7.5 percent
and posting the strongest level since mid-2008.
 In the energy markets, U.S. oil futures  settled at
$84.69 per barrel -- not far below a six-month intraday high of
$85.36. For the day, oil gained 79 cents, or 0.9 percent.
 In contrast, spot gold  fell $12.75, or 0.94 percent,
to $1,344.20 an ounce.
 Meanwhile, the 30-year Treasury bond  sank
nearly 2 full points, falling 1-27/32 in price to yield 4.05
percent -- up sharply from 3.94 percent late on Tuesday. In
late afternoon, though, the 30-year bond's yield hit 4.08
percent, the loftiest level since early August.
But the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note 
gained 3/32, with the yield slipping to 2.579 percent. The
2-year U.S. Treasury note  was up 1/32, with the
yield at 0.34 percent.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell against
the euro but rose versus the yen in volatile trade on Wednesday
after the Federal Reserve unveiled plans to buy $600 billion in
government bonds to help stimulate the economy.
 The euro soared to a session peak of $1.42 on the EBS
trading platform immediately after the Fed's announcement, the
highest level since Jan. 20, as some investors said the total
size of bond purchases was slightly bigger than expected.
 Markets were generally priced for the Fed initially to
commit to buying at least $500 billion in Treasury debt over
five months.
 ""This is negative for the dollar,"" said Michael Woolfolk,
senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon in New York. ""Overall
we are very much bearish on the dollar and there is absolutely
no way you can look at today's Fed action as a positive.""
 The euro  last traded 0.7 percent higher at
$1.4136. It earlier hit a session peak of $1.42 on EBS, the
highest level since Jan. 20.
 The euro then briefly surrendered gains to trade below
$1.40 as some investors reassessed the Fed's decision to buy
about $75 billion in longer-term Treasury bonds per month until
the second quarter of 2011. For details, see [ID:nN03287174]
 ""I don't think the Fed over-delivered."" said Richard
Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac in New York.
 ""And beyond June, there's nothing, there no outlook. I am
slightly underwhelmed. The dollar did sell off, but I don't

 The Fed said it would regularly review the pace and size of
the program and adjust it as needed depending on the path of
the recovery. In its post-meeting statement, the Fed described
economic growth as ""slow"", and said measures of inflation were
""somewhat low.""
 MORE DOLLAR DOWNSIDE
 ""After the dust settles, with the Fed the only major
central bank with a bias toward easing, the dollar is
vulnerable going forward,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market
analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington D.C.
""Over the near-term, a dollar/euro near $1.45 is within the
realm of possibilities.""
 Some analysts believe the euro can climb even higher. BNY
Mellon's Woolfolk said ""a euro/dollar at 1.50 by the middle of
next year is not out of the question.""
 But some remained skeptical about the euro's outlook given
renewed worries about the region's sovereign debt issues.
 The dollar has lost nearly 8.0 percent versus a basket of
major currencies <.DXY> since September on expectations that
more monetary easing from the Fed would pressure U.S. yields
and diminish the return on dollar-denominated assets.
 Alan Ruskin, head of G10 currency strategy at Deutsche Bank
in New York, said the Fed is ""being pretty aggressive"" at a
time when recent economic data has beat expectations and global
growth is still strong.
 ""The core medium-term strategy to look at long risk trades,
particularly in the (emerging markets) world still funded with
the U.S. dollar will remain unchanged,"" he said.
 The dollar rose 0.6 percent against the yen to 81.13
, hitting a high of 81.59 on EBS and taking out
options barriers at the 80.50 level.
 The all-time low of 79.95 yen was still in focus and
traders remained on alert for possible yen-selling intervention
by Japanese authorities to weaken its currency.
 The Bank of Japan meets on Nov. 4-5. The bank said it
brought forward its policy review to this week from
mid-November to heed calls to speed up the launch of its
5-trillion yen ($62 billion) asset buying scheme.
 ""Provided you see dollar weakness sustained against the
major currencies, I think the yen is likely to participate, so
we'll get another shot at 80 yen and below,"" Deutsche Bank's
Ruskin said.
 The Fed announcement followed a day after the widely
expected outcome of U.S. midterm elections -- where the
Republicans took control of the House of Representatives while
the Democrats were set to hang on to the Senate.

(Updates to close)
 By Claire Sibonney
 TORONTO, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar rose against
its U.S. counterpart in a volatile session on Wednesday,
keeping parity in sight after a brief slip, as markets absorbed
the Federal Reserve's bold push to breathe life into a
struggling U.S. economy.
 After months of speculation, the Fed launched a risky new
policy to buy $600 billion more in government bonds, aimed at
further lowering borrowing costs for consumers and businesses
still suffering from the financial crisis. [ID:nN03287174]
 Markets were generally priced for the Fed initially to
commit to buying at least $500 billion in U.S. Treasuries over
several months.
 While U.S. stocks got a small lift and the greenback
softened in reaction, longer-dated Treasuries sold off.
 ""There doesn't seem to be a lot of conviction here,"" said
Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at TD Securities.
 Osborne noted that with U.S. bond yields grinding higher
it's going to be difficult for the U.S. dollar to sustain its
current weakness.
 ""While the (U.S.) dollar might stay quite soft in the short
run, I don't think this is perhaps the trigger for a further
immediate selloff,"" he said.
 The Canadian dollar see-sawed in erratic trade following
the announcement, hitting both session highs and lows.
 The currency finished at C$1.0068 to the U.S. dollar, or
99.32 U.S. cents, up from Tuesday's close of C$1.0095 to the
U.S. dollar, or 99.06 U.S. cents.
 ""We'll see what the overnight market does but I won't be at
all surprised to see some (U.S. dollar) short-covering pushing
us back towards the C$1.01 area over the course of the next few
hours,"" Osborne added.
 Overall, the Canadian dollar is expected to gain momentum
against its struggling U.S. counterpart and trade around parity
for much of the next year, supported by strong fundamentals, a
Reuters poll showed on Wednesday. [ID:nN03102293]
 Earlier, investors were also assessing the potential impact
of U.S. midterm election results on riskier investments, after
Republicans took control of the House of Representatives and
weakened the Democratic majority in the Senate. [ID:nUSVOTE]
 ""With the Republican victory there are some positives for
the U.S. dollar, mostly being fiscal restraint,"" said Tom
Nakamura, fixed-income portfolio manager at AGF Investments.
 ""On the negative side ... it might mean that the Fed has to
do more of the heavy lifting in terms of stimulus for longer,
which would weigh on the U.S. dollar. What it comes down to for
the Canadian dollar is what is good for the U.S. economy in the
long term.""
 BONDS UNMOVED
 Canadian government debt prices were little changed as
investors bet the Fed's decision had already been priced in.
 ""This is potentially the last sort of pump of the bond
bubble inflating here so it's hard to see long term rates in
the U.S. dropping significantly further than they have
already,"" said Osborne.
 The two-year bond  gained half a Canadian cent to
yield 1.421 percent, while the 10-year bond  was flat
to yield 2.874 percent.
 In new issues, Canada's auction of five-year bonds met with
firm demand before the Fed's announcement even as the belly of
the curve, which has benefited from easier monetary policy, is
seen getting expensive for investors. [ID:nN03110651]

 * Business inventory behaviour critical to tracking cycle
 * Looming budget cuts mean private growth now sorely needed
 
 By Mike Dolan
 LONDON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Whisper it, but the private sector
of the world's major economies may be rebounding in the nick of
time -- just before the hammer comes down on public finances in
many countries next year.
 Amid all the angst this week over policy exhaustion and
mounting debt burdens in developed nations, factories around the
globe appear to have revved up in October for the first time in
six months.
 Surprisingly strong readings of manufacturing sentiment from
the United States, Britain, Germany and China -- bellwethers of
world economic growth -- all offered hope that the heavy burden
of economic support may at last be passing from public to
private hands.
 After a mid-year funk in which a ""double-dip"" recession was
the big fear for households, firms and investors worldwide, the
upbeat October business polls offer a glimmer of hope that
governments can at least start to tackle bloated budgets next
year without delivering a double-whammy to their economies.
 Economists at JPMorgan aggregate national manufacturing
surveys into a global index and they estimate this showed an
acceleration in factory growth in October for the first time
since April.
 Their index rose 1.2 points to 53.7, well above the 50 level
dividing overall expansion from contraction, and consistent with
4 percent annualised global industrial production growth -- well
off the 10 percent peaks of the March 2009-March 2010 recovery
but double the 2 percent lull of the past three months.
 They also point out this advance was led by a near 2-point
jump in new manufacturing orders, one of the forward-looking
components of the so-called Purchasing Managers Indices (PMI).
 But most encouraging of all, a critical ratio of orders to
inventories -- signalling relative changes in new business
relative to accumulation of unsold stock -- also popped higher.
""This month's survey hints that the industry cycle is
bottoming and that better times lie around the corner in early
2011,"" JPMorgan said, stressing its own in-house caution until
further data next month. ""It suggests that the inventory
correction and the consequent drag on manufacturing output are
beginning to lose intensity.""
 
 PLAYING THE INVENTORY STORY
 But it's this manufacturing inventory story that has been
crucial in deciphering the twists and turns of businesses'
reaction to the financial shocks of the past three years.
 The deep global recession triggered by Lehman Brothers'
collapse in 2008 was largely due to factories, racked by
uncertainty about future demand, suddenly shutting down
production in the face of the uncertainty and then running down
existing inventory to meet whatever final sales persisted.
 This production shutdown and hiring freeze caused a gross
domestic product shock that reverberated around the world during
the winter of 2008/09 and led to one of the steepest world
recessions since World War Two.
 Yet, final demand did not collapse nearly as much as
expected -- in large part due to huge monetary and fiscal
stimuli loosely coordinated by the top world economies.
 Fast forward to March 2009 and factories realised they had
already run dangerously low of inventory and quickly rebooted
production, and eventually hiring, through the remainder of last
year. The financial market and GDP surge that followed showed
just how valuable tracking this behaviour can be.
 ""Double-dip"" worriers, however, feared this inventory
rebuilding had run its course by the second quarter of this year
and were correct in predicting an economic retreat over the past
six months as inventory production ebbed again without a
countervailing pick-up in orders. Economies began to splutter.
 So October's quick rebound, coming as it does in the final
quarter of 2010, could be another defining moment.
 And the pop in the critical orders/inventory ratio, which
had been falling steadily since April, could mark a major turn
if sustained.
 Moreover, the October manufacturing burst is also remarkable
in its widespread nature. The German and Chinese sectors had
already been accelerating through recent months but big gains in
the United States and Britain were more startling.
 Even euro zone laggards Ireland and Spain saw their factory
sectors move back to expansion last month from contraction.
 JPMorgan's own caution stems from concern about the speed
with which a $115 billion annualised rate accumulation of U.S.
businees inventories in the third quarter can be worked off and
from weakness in manufacturing readings from South Korea and
Taiwan.
 But the positive tilt to the surveys tally with other
leading barometers of the global economic recovery.
 Goldman Sachs' ""Global Leading Indicator"" slowed to 4.3
percent year-on-year growth last month from 5.1 percent in
September, but it remains robust above historical averages into
the fourth quarter of 2010.
 ""This supports our expectation that global growth will
remain strong going forward,"" Goldman economists told clients.
 If so, the private sector recovery will be vital next year
as austerity budgets in Europe and elsewhere kick in.
 Cornell University Professor and Brookings scholar Eswar
Prasad this week sketched the fiscal mess in advanced economies.
 Based on International Monetary Fund forecasts, he
calculated aggregate net government debt in the world will more
than double from $23 trillion, or 44 percent of world GDP, in
2007 to $48 trillion, or 65 percent of GDP, in 2015.
 And advanced economies, where aggregate debt-to-GDP ratios
will rise from 48 percent in 2007 to 71 percent this year and a
whopping 85 percent in 2015, are the root cause.
""Advanced economies had better get their fiscal act together
once the recovery is better entrenched,"" he wrote, warning of
the risk of global instability if debt piles are left untouched.

 * Fed intends to buy $600 bln of bonds by end of Q2 2011
 * Stocks, commodities rise after volatile moves
 * Dollar, Treasuries fall after Fed's decision
(Updates with FOMC decision)
 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose slightly
and the dollar fell on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve
said it would buy $600 billion more in government bonds by
mid-2011 in an attempt to boost the anemic U.S. economy.
 Longer-dated U.S. government bond prices fell sharply and
commodities rose as the dollar's value weakened ahead of the
Fed's decision to print more money to buy Treasuries. A flood
of dollars on the market debases the currency's value.
 ""All in all, it means more dollars. The debt's going to
expand. It should lead to a weaker dollar,"" said Sterling
Smith, an analyst at Country Hedging Inc, in Minnesota.
 ""In general, it's going to be bullish for all commodities.
Any commodity that has a good fundamental story is going to
have legs on this.""
 The decision, which takes the Fed into largely uncharted
waters, is aimed at further lowering borrowing costs for
consumers and businesses still suffering in the aftermath of
the worst recession since the Great Depression.
 The U.S. central bank said it would buy about $75 billion
in longer-term Treasury bonds per month. It said it would
regularly review the pace and size of the program, and adjust
it as needed, depending on the path of the recovery.
 In its post-meeting statement, the Fed described the
economy as ""slow,"" and said employers remained reluctant to
add to payrolls. It said measures of inflation were ""somewhat
low.""
 ""I don't think the Fed overdelivered. Strictly speaking,
$75 billion a month is less than $100 billion, said Richard
Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac in New
York.
 ""Some were suggesting that the Fed may change the
'extended period' language into an even more extended period,
but the Fed didn't,"" Franulovich added. ""And beyond June,
there's nothing, there is no outlook. I am slightly
underwhelmed. The dollar did sell off, but I don't think this
spike in the euro has legs.""
 The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, with the
U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> down 0.32 percent at 76.477.
 The euro  rose 0.51 percent to $1.4107 after briefly
hitting a session peak of $1.42 immediately after the Fed's
announcement.
 But the greenback remained higher against the Japanese yen
in volatile trading after the Fed's statement. The dollar
 gained 0.81 percent to 81.27.
 STOCKS EDGE HIGHER AFTER THE FED
 U.S. stocks zigzagged in volatile trade after the Fed's
statement as analysts had already priced in an injection of
around $500 billion by the Fed.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 4.50
points, or 0.04 percent, to 11,193.22. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> rose 1.81 points, or 0.15 percent, to
1,195.38. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> inched up 0.70
of a point, or 0.03 percent, to 2,534.22 Earlier, the Nasdaq
touched a fresh 52-week intraday high at 2,541.42.
 ""The Republican victory and quantitative easing are both
net positives for the market, but it's not surprising that we
would sell on the news,"" said Alec Young, equity strategist at
S&P Equity Research in New York. ""I don't think there's a
break in the trend, however, which remains up.""
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> was up 0.16
percent at 319.79 in late afternoon trading after rising to an
intraday high of 320.42, bringing gains this year to 7.5
percent and posting the strongest level since mid-2008.
 In energy and commodities markets, U.S. oil futures 
rose 79 cents, or 0.94 percent, to settle at $84.69 per barrel
-- not far below a six-month intraday high of $85.36. In
contrast, spot gold  fell $12.75, or 0.94 percent, to
$1,344.20 an ounce.
 Meanwhile, the 30-year Treasury bond  sank more
than 2 full points, trading 2-17/32 in price to yield 4.08
percent -- the loftiest since early August -- and sharply
higher than 3.94 percent late on Tuesday.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note 
slipped 4/32, with the yield rising to 2.607 percent. The
2-year U.S. Treasury note  was up 1/32, with the
yield at 0.34 percent.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell against
the euro but remained higher versus the yen in volatile trade
after the Federal Reserve unveiled plans to buy $600 billion in
government bonds to help stimulate the economy.
 The euro briefly hit a session peak of $1.42 on trading
platform EBS immediately after the Fed's announcement as some
investors said the total size of bond purchases was slightly
bigger than expected.
 Markets were generally priced for the Fed initially to
commit to buying at least $500 billion in Treasuries over
several months.
 But the euro quickly fell back as investors reassessed the
Fed's decision to buy about $75 billion in longer-term Treasury
bonds per month until mid 2011.
 ""I don't think the Fed over-delivered. Strictly $75 billion
a month is less than $100 billion,"" said Richard Franulovich,
senior currency strategist at Westpac in New York.
 ""And beyond June, there's nothing, there no outlook. I am
slightly underwhelmed. The dollar did sell off, but I don't
think this spike in the euro has legs,"" he added.
 The euro last traded 0.1 percent higher at $1.4052. It
earlier hit a session peak of $1.42, the highest level since
late January.
 Some analysts believe the dollar should continue to see
pressure.
 ""After the dust settles, with the Fed the only major
central bank with a bias toward easing makes the dollar
vulnerable going forward. Over the near-term, a dollar/euro
near $1.45 is within the realm of possibilities,"" said Omer
Esiner, chief market analyst, commonwealth foreign exchange,
Washington D.C.
 The dollar has lost nearly 8 percent versus a basket of
currencies since the start of September on expectations for
more monetary easing from the Fed, a move that would pressure
U.S. yields and diminish the return on dollar-denominated
assets.
 The Fed announcement followed a day after the widely
expected outcome of U.S. midterm elections -- where the
Republicans took control of the House of Representatives while
the Democrats were set to hang on to the Senate.
 The dollar rose 0.9 percent against the yen to 81.36,
hitting a high of 81.59 on EBS and taking out options barriers
at the 80.50 level.
 The U.S. Dollar Index, a measure of the greenback versus a
basket of six currencies, was flat at 76.743.

 * Government spending seen up in 2011
 * For Q+A on oil range change implications:
 
 By Martin Dokoupil and Ulf Laessing
 DUBAI/RIYADH, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's shift to a
higher oil price comfort range reflects a desire to make up for
a weaker dollar rather than strain on the kingdom's budget and
government spending is seen staying strong in the coming year.
 The world's top crude exporter moved its preferred price up
a notch this week, saying $70-$90 a barrel was an acceptable
range for consumers, driving oil prices higher.
 ""I do not think it has a budget connection. The dollar's
weakness is the most significant factor,"" said Andrew Gilmour,
senior economist at Samba Financial Group in London.
 Until this week, Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi had said
the ideal range for producers and consumers was $70-$80 a
barrel, the line held for the past two years.
 His comments on Monday helped drive benchmark U.S. crude to
a session high of $83.86 a barrel. The price firmed further and
touched a six-month high above $85 on Wednesday.
 The U.S. currency has weakened in anticipation the Federal
Reserve would opt for a new round of quantitative easing.
 ""They see that double-dip concerns are no longer at the
forefront of people's thinking and prospects for quantitative
easing two mean a weaker dollar globally,"" said Reinhard Cluse,
EMEA economist at UBS in London.
 ""Thinking that they would like to fix their budget by
manipulating the oil price is too far fetched. They have the
influential position but they are not a price maker,"" he said.
 The Saudi finance ministry declined to comment.
 As oil is priced in dollars, a weakening of the currency
reduces revenues for non-U.S. producers and also contributes to
a perception that oil prices have scope to rise.
 Key OPEC member Saudi Arabia ramped up spending to help its
crude-reliant economy sail through the global crisis, launching
a $400 billion five-year plan in 2008, the largest stimulus
relative to gross domestic product among 20 leading nations.
 This jump in spending raised the budget break-even oil price
by nearly $40 between 2006 and 2010, Banque Saudi Fransi
estimates, with $70 a barrel seen as a comfort level.
 ""The absolute minimum OPEC oil price basket that Saudi
Arabia needs is around $60 per barrel. Below that level they are
very unhappy and even at $60, they are not covering a number of
costs, debt interest, capital expenditure and contingencies,""
said Leo Drollas, deputy executive director and chief economist
at the Centre for Global Energy Studies. 
 ""Altogether, Saudi needs around $74 per barrel and this year
the price is likely to average around $75,"" he said.
 
 HIGH SPENDING
 Last month, Finance Minister Ibrahim Alassaf said the top
Arab economy expects to spend more than initially budgeted for
2010.
 ""I do not believe that Saudi Arabia needs higher oil prices.
However, the falling dollar is becoming a concern,"" said Khan
Zahid, chief economist at Riyad Capital.
 The dollar, which is moving near its softest levels against
the euro since the end of January, is expected to stay weak as
the course of U.S. and European monetary policies diverges.
 A surge in oil receipts has encouraged the OPEC member to
exceed budgeted spending on a regular basis. The kingdom
overspent its plan by 26 percent last year, posting a deficit of
6.2 percent of GDP, nearly double its original plan.
 Riyadh drafted its 2010 budget with a 70 billion riyal gap
($18.7 billion) and spending of 540 billion riyals with an
expansionary mode seen continuing next year.
 ""The higher spending does not seem to be moderating and 2011
will be characterized by another expansionary budget,"" said John
Sfakianakis, chief economist at Banque Saudi Fransi.
 Despite its wealth Saudi Arabia is facing rising
unemployment of its citizens and is spending on building
universities and industrial projects to create jobs.

 MEXICO CITY/SAO PAULO, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Latin American
stocks rose on Wednesday as investors kept bets that more
liquidity will flood markets after a monetary policy
announcement from the U.S. Federal Reserve later in the day.
 The Fed is expected to announce a plan to buy around $500
billion in government bonds in an attempt to keep rates low and
breathe new life into a struggling U.S. economy.
 The MSCI Latin American stocks index <.MILA00000PUS> added
0.25 percent. The index has gained 13.1 percent since Aug. 31
as investors searched for higher yields in emerging market
assets on expectations the new Fed policy will hold down U.S.
rates.
 ""We could see a correction after the announcement - a form
of 'buy the rumor sell the news,'"" said Gerardo Roman, head of
stock trading at Actinver exchange in Mexico City.
 Mexico's benchmark IPC stock index <.MXX> rose 0.4 percent,
boosted by gains in Cemex , the world's No. 3 cement
maker, which rose 4.48 percent to 11.2.
 ""Once the share price broke 11 pesos with conviction the
stock became quite interesting technically speaking,"" Roman
said. ""And investors are more confident in the stock now that
Cemex has renegotiated its debt payment.""
 The northern Mexico-based company announced on Oct. 27 that
it had renegotiated debt covenants with its bankers.

 Mexican miners also gained on the IPC. Grupo Mexico
 added 1.23 percent while miner Penoles
 jumped 3.3 percent.
 Brazil's Bovespa <.BVSP> gained 0.25 percent, led by
preferred shares of state-run oil company Petrobras ,
which added 1.52 percent.
 BTG Pactual analyst Gustavo Gattass cited more disclosure
on the Campos Basin finds, a strong real and the potential for
lower refining expenses as reasons to resume coverage of the
company's American Depositary receipts  with a buy
recommendation.
 BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research also predicted global
oil demand will hit a record high in 2011 in a report on
Wednesday due in part to effects of expected monetary easing
from the Fed.
 ""We believe that oil is only starting to reflect a weak
dollar,"" the report said.
 Investors also judged the first policy remarks by
President-elect Dilma Rousseff as market-friendly, supporting
the Sao Paulo index gains.
 ""The first impression she left among local and foreign
investors is that there's a strong sense of equilibrium, or
prudence that should guide policy actions through 2014,"" said
Marcio Macedo, who helps manage $38 million in assets for Sao
Paulo-based Humaita Investimentos.
 Homebuilders rose on the Bovespa, led by a 1.71 percent
gain in PDG Realty  after local media reported that
Rousseff will focus policy efforts on bringing down borrowing
costs and improving access to mortgage lending by taming
inflation and streamlining government spending.

 * Unions will keep up pressure until talks opened
 * CGT's Thibault sees no change with new cabinet

(Adds fresh quotes, background, story links) 
 By Geert De Clercq and Catherine Bremer 
 PARIS, Nov 3 (Reuters) - France's CGT trade union will
propose a new national day of protests against an unpopular
pension reform, even as the government hopes to move on from the
issue, the union's head told Reuters on Wednesday.
 CGT head Bernard Thibault said protests over a two-year
increase in the retirement age would not end until President
Nicolas Sarkozy invites unions for talks on modifying the
legislation, which should be signed into law in the coming days.
 ""Whatever the government thinks, the issue of pension reform
is far from over,"" Thibault said in an interview at the union's
headquarters in eastern Paris.
 ""Even when it signs this into law, the protests will drag on
the government like a ball and chain for a very long time.""
 Unions will meet on Thursday to agree on further action
against the pension reform and how to proceed after Saturday,
when they have scheduled another day of countrywide
demonstrations, the eighth day since the summer of joint action
between the CGT, the more moderate CFDT union and other unions.
 Thibault said the CGT, the more militant of France's two
main unions, wanted to call a further day of protests later in
November.
 Sarkozy's flagship pension reform prompted French unions to
organise some of the biggest protest demonstrations in Europe
since the start of the financial crisis.
 Yet despite drawing millions of marchers to the street,
badly disrupting fuel supplies with strikes and enjoying broad
support in opinion polls, the unions have not stopped parliament
from approving the reform.
 The reform will raise the minimum retirement age to receive
a state pension to 62 from 60, and the age to receive a full
pension to 67 from 65. Sarkozy says the unpopular measure is
necessary to save France's public finances from disaster.
 Thibault said Sarkozy was mistaken in thinking he could turn
the page on the pension showdown with a cabinet reshuffle later
this month. French media are speculating that Energy Minister
Jean-Louis Borloo, a popular centrist with good union relations,
could be elevated to prime minister to restore social dialogue.
 ""The movement is not finished,"" Thibault said. ""It will take
much more than just a reshuffle, or the appointment of this
person or that person, it will take content.""
 A lack of concessions made under the pension law to people
working in physically hard sectors, like construction, meant
localised strikes could break out on a company-by-company basis
in the weeks and months ahead, Thibault added.
 Sarkozy's refusal to negotiate over the retirement age had
damaged the relationship between unions and the government, and
only a review of the pension system could mend it, he added.

 By Walker Simon
 NEW YORK, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Stronger-than-expected U.S.
economic data helped lift the long-battered dollar, knocking
world stocks off two-year highs on Wednesday and spurring oil
prices' retreat from a six-month peak.
 The latest batch of data pointed to a U.S. recovery, but
markets remained focused on the Federal Reserve, expected
within hours to announce it would seek to stimulate business
activity via hefty debt purchases that may cut long-term
interest rates.
""The market's concern about the recovery will remain and
the Fed later today may look at this as still a sign they need
to ease further on monetary policy,"" said Subodh Kumar, chief
investment strategist of Subodh Kumar & Associates in
Toronto.
 The uncertainty about the scope of the Fed's announcement,
expected at 2:15 p.m. (1815 GMT), kept many investors on the
sidelines and pushed U.S. stocks modestly lower.
 In the latest round of economic data, the Institute for
Supply Management index showed the U.S. services sector grew
more quickly than expected in October and the Commerce
Department reported that September factory orders posted their
largest gain in eight months. A report from payrolls processor
ADP said U.S. private-sector employers added more jobs than
expected in October. For more see ]ID:nN03287204]
 The helped the dollar regain its poise and strengthen
against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, with the
U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.14 percent at 76.832.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  shot up almost
1 percent to 81.40 yen from 80.62 on Tuesday. The euro 
fell 0.19 percent to $1.4011 from Tuesday's close of $1.4037.
 Since last Wednesday, the dollar index has fallen about
0.5 percent as the Fed's expected push to buy assets and lower
bond interest rates drove investors into other currencies
whose debt offers higher returns.
 BONDS RALLY BEFORE THE FED
 U.S. Treasury debt prices rose for a second straight day
as investors prepared for the Federal Reserve's announcement,
which markets have priced in as $500 billion in debt purchases
over five months, with an open-ended commitment to buy more --
if necessary.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note 
gained 14/32, with the yield falling to 2.541 percent from
2.954 percent late on Tuesday.
 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  climbed 29/32,
with the yield at 3.8801 percent, down from Tuesday's 3.94
percent.

points, or 0.50 percent, to 2,520.82.
 Wall Street's dip weighed on top European shares <.FTEU3>,
which fell 0.49 percent to 1,087 points.
 Before the U.S. stock market opened trading, the MSCI
world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose as high as 320.42,
bringing gains this year to 7.5 percent and posting the
strongest level since mid-2008. It was helped by the MSCI
emerging equities index <.MSCIEF>, which hit its highest point
since June 2008.
 At midday in New York, the MSCI world index was down 0.23
percent at 318.57 points.
 The stronger dollar made oil, metals and other commodities
more expensive for non-U.S. investors, diluting their
investment appeal.
 U.S. sweet light crude futures  touched a six=month
high of $85.36 a barrel, partly on the belief that the Fed's
expected moves will spur the U.S. economy and increase energy
demand.

percent, at $84.53 per barrel.

 (adds quotes, background)
 By Nick Vinocur
 PARIS, Nov 3 (Reuters) - French Economy Minister Christine
Lagarde said on Wednesday that volatility in foreign exchange
markets was hitting exporters such as aircraft manufacturers and
was having an even greater impact in emerging economies.
 France takes over the presidency of the G20 industrialised
and developing nations in less than two weeks with an ambitious
agenda of reforming the global monetary system, reducing
volatility in commodities markets and improving international
economic governance.
 ""The level of volatility that we have observed lately is
certainly not helping exporters, and here I'm obviously thinking
about some of our key manufacturers including aircrafts. But
it's even more difficult for developing countries,"" she said in
a speech in English to the American Bar Association in Paris.
 One symptom of foreign exchange volatility has been the
value of the dollar, which has lost ground against trading
partners in recent months on mixed economic signals and
speculation over how much money the Federal Reserve will print
under a new stimulus plan to be unveiled later on Tuesday.
 World leaders converging in Seoul for this month's G20
summit are expected to discuss means of limiting swings in
foreign exchange rates, following US accusations that China is
keeping its currency artificially weak to promote its exports.
 Although Washington is expected to press Beijing to speed up
the revaluation of the yuan, Lagarde said the G20 should ""try
not to corner anybody but effectively have the general interest
transcend.""
 Lagarde, a former head of American law firm Baker &
McKenzie, also said that abrupt changes in the price of
commodities were another source of economic instability that
France would try to address during its G20 presidency.
 ""If you are drilling oil, if you are refining oil, if you
are setting up a paper mill ... you need to have a level of
certainty because your business model is going to rely heavily
on that stability of prices,"" she said.

on from the issue, the union's head told Reuters on Wednesday.
 CGT head Bernard Thibault said protests over a two-year
increase in France's retirement age would not end until
President Nicolas Sarkozy invites unions for talks on modifying
the law.
 ""Whatever the government thinks, the issue of pension reform
is far from over,"" Thibault said in an interview. ""Even when it
signs this into law, the protests will drag on the government
like a ball and chain for a very long time.""
 Unions will meet on Thursday to agree on further joint
action against the pension reform. Thibault said the CGT, the
more militant of France's two main unions, could continue with
localised strikes and protest actions on a company-by-company
basis in the weeks and months ahead.

828,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2010 12:28PM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Economic issues at heart of Obama Asia trip," Nov 3 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama's upcoming trip to
Asia will be focused on efforts to open up new markets for
American goods and strengthen the U.S. economy, administration
officials said.
 Here are some economic items that will be on Obama's agenda
on the trip to India, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan, which
includes a G20 summit in Seoul and an Asia-Pacific leaders
summit in Yokohama.
 The president leaves for India on Friday and returns to
Washington on Nov. 14. The trip begins three days after the
midterm congressional elections in which voters punished his
fellow Democrats for the sputtering U.S. economy and high
unemployment.
 GLOBAL IMBALANCES
 Obama and his team will push hard during his trip and
especially at the G20 to limit ""excessive imbalances"" in the
global economy by encouraging countries such as Germany and
China to boost domestic demand and reduce their reliance on
exports to fuel economic growth.
 U.S. officials warn that American consumers cannot remain
the engine of growth for the world economy and must save more.
Obama is seeking to double U.S. exports within five years.
 ""Many Asian economies in particular have strong potential
to fuel domestic demand either through domestic consumption in
some cases, through major infrastructure investments in other
cases, and through both, in other countries,"" Treasury Under
Secretary for International Affairs Lael Brainard told
reporters at the White House.
 ""This provides important opportunities for America's
dynamic exporters, and it also boosts growth more broadly.""
 CURRENCY
 The U.S. wish for China to let its yuan currency rise is
well known. Obama will have a chance to discuss the issue
further when he meets with Chinese President Hu Jintao on the
G20 sidelines in Seoul.
 Brainard said the United States wants more progress from
emerging market economies on the currency issue and urged them
to cooperate so others would feel encouraged to move.
 U.S. officials say China holds the value of the yuan
artificially low against the dollar to support exports, adding
to a massive trade surplus Washington would like to ease by
getting Beijing to let the yuan rise.
 UNLOCKING INDIAN COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL
 Despite its size, India is only the United States' 14th
biggest trading partner, and the White House would like Obama's
three-day visit to Mumbai and New Delhi to be a step toward
unlocking its commercial potential, which could help ballast
the rise of China.
 The White House expects several commercial deals between
U.S. and Indian companies to be finalized during the visit, and
says it is making progress in ironing out existing obstacles to
greater trade between the two nations.
 Obama will also speak at a summit of U.S. and Indian
business leaders in Mumbai.
 Obama is not visiting India's technology hubs Hyderabad and
Bangalore, favorite targets of U.S. politicians who say
offshoring jobs is partly to blame for high U.S. unemployment.
 Indian officials have protested a recent hike in U.S. visa
fees that is expected to hit India's IT industry, and proposed
tax changes -- supported by Obama -- that would end breaks for
U.S. firms that create jobs and profits overseas.
 SOUTH KOREA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT
 Washington and Seoul signed a free trade agreement in 2007,
but the deal has languished in the face of opposition in the
U.S. Congress. Negotiators are putting ""maximum effort"" toward
resolving objections to the agreement before Obama arrives in
Seoul on Nov. 10.
 One major sticking point is South Korea's refusal to allow
imports of all cuts of U.S. beef, irrespective of cattle age,
lifting a restriction imposed after the discovery of mad cow
disease in the U.S. cattle herd in 2003.
 The United States also wants South Korea to do more to open
its market to U.S. automobiles. Many U.S. lawmakers complain
the 2007 agreement does too little to change South Korean
regulatory and tax policies that have long kept U.S.
automobiles out of the Korean market.
 Prospects for the pact could improve now that Republicans
have won control of the House of Representatives, because some
of the stiffest opposition to the FTA came from Obama's fellow
Democrats.
 U.S. TRADE WITH ASIA-PACIFIC
 On Obama's first trip to Asia in 2009, he announced the
United States would join with seven other countries -- Chile,
Peru, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Brunei and Vietnam --
to negotiate a regional free trade agreement to be called the
TransPacific Partnership.
 Since then, Malaysia has joined the talks.
 Other countries such as Japan and Canada have expressed
interest in joining the negotiations, but current members worry
adding too many countries could complicate the goal of reaching
a high-quality ""21st Century"" pact to liberalize agriculture,
manufacturing and services trade in the region.
 At the conclusion of the annual Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum summit in Japan on Nov. 13, the United States
takes over leadership of 21-nation grouping for the next year.

 * U.S. private payrolls report helps dollar
 * FOMC in focus; open-ended approach key to dollar outlook
 * Dollar/yen trades above 81 yen
(Adds comment, U.S. data, updates prices)
 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The dollar gained against the
euro and yen on Wednesday on better-than-expected data on
private payrolls and the service sector, though trading was in
tight ranges ahead of a Federal Reserve decision that was
widely expected to further ease monetary policy.
 The much anticipated announcement by the Federal Open
Market Committee later in the session may push Treasury debt
yields lower and diminish the appeal of some U.S. assets.
 Analysts, however, said the negative impact on the dollar
may not be all that significant, with many convinced the Fed
action has been pretty much priced in the last few sessions.
 ""Seeing a strengthening dollar/yen we think could be an
early sign that the Fed is not going to be as aggressive as
some people were forecasting and that they're not going to do
$500 billion,"" said Greg Salvaggio, senior vice president for
capital markets at Tempus Consulting in Washington.
 ""One would think if the Fed was going to do $500 billion
this afternoon, you would see dollar/yen challenging 80 right
now and euro/dollar in the mid-$1.41 and gold about $40 to $50
higher than where it is right now.""
 Markets were generally priced for the Fed initially to
commit to buying at least $500 billion in Treasuries over five
months, but traders were eager for details of the scope and
pace of bond purchases.
 At midday the euro  was 0.2 percent lower at
$1.4011, held in a $1.4000-50 range for much of the session.
 The dollar rose 0.9 percent against the yen to 81.13
, hitting a high of 81.51 and taking out options
barriers at the 80.50 level. The all-time low of 79.95 yen was
still in focus as the market stayed sensitive to the potential
for fresh Japanese intervention to stem the yen's rise.
 POSITIVE U.S. DATA
 Gains in dollar/yen were helped by U.S. data showing a
43,000 rise in private sector payrolls last month, a
higher-than-expected reading for an index of services sector
activity, and an increase in factory orders. For an economic
wrapup, click on [ID:N03287204].
 Sterling  hit a nine-month high of $1.6157 after
stronger-than-expected UK services sector activity data added
to the view that the Bank of England may not implement more QE
any time soon. [ID:nLDE6A20TQ] Sterling last traded up 0.2
percent at $1.6096.
 Traders also said liquidity had dried up since the start of
the week, with one trader in London saying his turnover in the
past two days had been the lowest in five years.
 Market participants are expecting the Fed announcement to
offer more clarity on whether the dollar's latest sell-off
since September would continue through the end of 2010.
 ""The extent of QE2 (quantitative easing) and whether there
is talk of a further sequel will determine dollar direction for
the remainder of the year,"" said Mikkel Thorup, chief
investment officer of Capricorn, a Switzerland-based currency
management firm.
 ""We are not far from the $1.4160 previous (euro) high and
we would expect a dovish outcome to see us explode through
there. Alternatively a conservative outcome will disappoint the
dollar shorts out there and dampen global risk appetite - a
move through $1.3860 and a test of $1.3730 should result.""

 * Chile's peso weakens 0.3 on intervention fears
(Adds context about Brazil, updates prices)
 By Samantha Pearson and Froilan Romero
 SAO PAULO/SANTIAGO, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Brazil's currency
surged on Wednesday while Mexico's peso hit a 6-month high
ahead of a likely announcement on monetary stimulus measures in
the United States.
 The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce after
2:15 p.m. EDT (1815 GMT) asset purchases of at least $500
billion via quantitative easing -- in effect printing money to
buy bonds and lower borrowing costs. For more, see:
[ID:nLDE6A2062]
 That should keep yields on U.S. Treasuries close to record
lows, encouraging investors to buy Latin America's
higher-yielding bonds.
 Brazil is a prime target because the country's benchmark
interest rate of 10.75 percent is one of the highest in the
world.
 The Brazilian real  surged as much as 1.1 percent in
early trading on Wednesday and was later up 0.70 percent at
1.694 reais per U.S. dollar on the local spot market.
 The real was also pricing in the region's gains on Tuesday,
when Brazil's markets were closed for a public holiday.
 ""The market was shut yesterday, so there was a movement in
other currencies that the real wasn't able to follow. But to a
great extent, (the real is stronger) in anticipation of the
results of the Fed meeting,"" said Marianna Costa, an economist
with Link Investimentos in Sao Paulo.
 ""Anything close to $500 billion is already priced into the
market. If it was something closer to $1 trillion, there could
be some more space for appreciation. If it is less (than $500
billion), the market, like everywhere else in the world, is not
going to take it well.""
 The Mexican currency  edged up to its strongest level
since May 3, later trading 0.10 percent stronger at 12.2927 per
dollar.
 ""I believe the Fed will move to purchase the expected $500
billion in bonds and the peso won't see a huge move after the
announcement,"" said Alfredo Puig, a trader at Vector brokerage
in Monterrey, Mexico.
 But if the amount is less than expected, the currency could
rapidly weaken to 12.38, he added.
 Some economists say the peso could outperform the region's
other currencies in the months ahead because of the country's
hands-off approach to its currency market. [ID:nN0147422]
 WAITING TO STRIKE
 Other governments across the region have taken a series of
intervention measures, such as dollar purchases and capital
controls, to slow rallies in their local currencies.
 A stronger currency makes exports more expensive abroad and
can cause long-term damage to a country's economy.
 For example, data this week is expected to show that
Brazil's industrial output slowed again last month because of
the strong real.
 Fears of new measures hit the Chilean peso  on
Wednesday. It weakened 0.33 percent to 488.6 per dollar.
[ID:nN30113748]
 ""There are rumors in the market that after the Fed's
decision, some new measures will be taken here to curb the
peso,"" said one trader in Santiago.
 The peso has strengthened 12 percent since the end of June
as the country has recovered rapidly from a devastating
earthquake in February.
 President Sebastian Pinera said last week his government is
working to open capital accounts and relax limits on
investments abroad to battle the peso's appreciation.
 Analysts say the central bank may also go back to buying
dollars in the market or find others ways to encourage capital
outflows. [ID:nN20242719]

 By Walker Simon
 NEW YORK, Nov 3 (Reuters) - World stocks hit a two-year
high on Wednesday and oil climbed to a six-month peak as
investors anticipated that the U.S. central bank would within
hours announce hefty debt purchases to spur the flagging U.S.
economy.
 Stronger-than-expected data on U.S. job creation as well
as on factory orders and the service sector helped the dollar
rally against the yen and rise against the euro. Against a
basket of major trading-partner currencies, the dollar<.DXY>
rose 0.16 percent,
 ""The data reinforces the fact that the U.S. economy is
bottoming, if not gradually beginning to recover,"" said
Greg Salvaggio, vice president of trading of Tempus
Consulting in Washington. ""We're obviously at the bottom of
the U in the recovery.""
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  jumped 0.9
percent to 81.37 from a previous session close of 80.620.
The euro  dipped 0.2 percent to $1.4008.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices rose for a second straight day
as investors prepared for the Federal Reserve to announce at
2:15 p.m. (1815 GMT) what markets have priced in as $500
billion in debt purchases over five months, with an open-ended
commitment to buy more -- if necessary.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note 
gained 14/32, with the yield slipping to 2.539 percent from
2.954 percent late on Tuesday. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond
 shot up 31/32, with the yield dropping to 3.879
percent from 3.94 percent the previous day.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose as high
as 320.42, bringing gains this year to about 7.5 percent and
marking the highest level since mid-2008. By late morning,
though, the index had given up the gains to trade at 318.71,
down 0.2 percent.
 WALL ST REFLECTS UNCERTAINTY
 But the uncertainty about the scope of the Federal
Reserve's imminent announcement kept many investors on the
sidelines and U.S. stocks softened.
On Wall Street, The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI>
declined 15.36 points, or 0.14 percent, to 11,173.36. The
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> shed 2.73 points, or 0.23
percent, to 1,190.84. The Nasdaq Composite Index<.IXIC> fell
8.78 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,524.74.
 In contrast, the MSCI emerging equities index <.MSCIEF>
hit its highest since June 2008. With the prospect of the Fed
seeking to push long-term interest rates even lower, investors
have flocked to emerging markets for higher, though riskier
returns.
 An index of top European shares <.FTEU3> hit a session
high at 1,098.83, but then gave up its gain to trade at
1,089.86, down 0.4 percent.
In commodities markets, U.S. sweet light crude futures
 touched a six=month high of $85.04 a barrel, partly due
to the perception that the Fed's expected moves will spur the
U.S. economy and increase energy demand.
 But oil later pulled back some as the dollar rose higher,
with the front-month U.S. crude futures contract up 54 cents,
or 0.6 percent, at $84.44 per barrel in late morning trading.
 Gold prices slipped as the dollar's rally advanced, with
spot gold prices  off $2.30, or 0.17 percent, at
$1,354.70 an ounce.
 The dollar has a marked inverse relationship to gold and
oil as a weaker dollar makes it cheaper for non-U.S. investors
to buy them,
Some economists said the latest batch of U.S. economic data
released on Wednesday reinforced that the view the economy was
poised for further growth.
 In data seen as a prelude to the government's monthly
non-farm payrolls report on Friday, payrolls processor ADP
said in a report on Wednesday that U.S. private-sector
companies added 43,000 jobs in October.
 The U.S. government also said new orders received by U.S.
factories rose more than expected in September to post their
largest gain in eight months.
 The U.S. services sector grew more quickly than expected
in October, its 10th straight month of expansion, according to
the Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing sector
index. The sector, which comprises mostly service-sector
firms, accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic
activity.

 * Investors ""complacent"" on Hungarian politics
 By Sebastian Tong
 LONDON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Huge gaps in growth and interest
rates have turned the flow of money from mature into emerging
economies into a torrent, but the truism that some markets are
riskier than others should give investors pause for thought.
 Currencies and asset prices have hit multi-month highs in a
broad swathe of emerging markets, suggesting a degree of
complacency in the finance industry that could, in some cases,
exacerbate familiar risks posed by inflation, politics and trade
imbalances.
 ""The thinking is 'out of West, into rest'. It's much more
indiscriminate than what we've seen before,"" said Michael Power,
global strategist Investec Asset Management in Cape Town.
 ""People will eventually have to wake up to the fact that
emerging markets are not born equal.""
 A consequence of the ultra-low interest rates in much of the
developed world, the wave of money heading to these markets is
also part of a longer term trend precipitated by their
relatively robust economic growth rates.
 Record amounts ploughed into the asset class have sent the
emerging markets equities benchmark <.MSCIEF> to 2-1/2 year
highs, up 14 percent this year, double its global peer's gains
<.MIWD00000PUS>.
 A second round of asset buying to be unveiled this week by
the U.S. Federal Reserve could drive emerging markets higher.
 But as witnessed during Asia's late 1990s crash, such
investor optimism can evaporate quickly.
 And evidence that a range of risk factors are being
underplayed -- from inflation pressures in India and rand
strength South Africa to potential trade imbalances in Turkey
and unorthodox fiscal policies in Hungary -- suggests conditions
are ripe for history to repeat itself.
 
 RISK UNPRICED
 The extra money pumped in by the Fed to spur economic
recovery could also push commodity prices up, amplifying price
pressures that many governments already strain to cope with.
 India this week raised interest rates for the sixth time
this year to try to tame stubbornly high inflation.
 Runaway inflation threatens social stability in emerging
economies such as Indonesia and Nigeria which tend to hold a
larger proportion of their consumer price baskets in food.
 Monetary policy slippages could upend the rally in emerging
sovereign debt <11EMJ> <11EMJ> <.JGEGDCM> that has so far
returned over 16 percent for investors this year.
 ""I don't think inflation is a risk that's fully priced into
market now. There's a good chance that things become
unmanageable a little while from now,"" said Bhanu Baweja, global
head of emerging-markets currency research at UBS. 
 Investors could also be underplaying the risks in Turkey and
South Africa, two of 2010's best performing emerging markets.
 The lira  is at its strongest in two years and Turkish
shares <.XU100> hit historic heights late last month.
 But the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD) has warned that Turkey's current account deficit -- some
6 percent of its output on an annualised basis -- leaves it
exposed to any reversal in capital flows.
 Portfolio flows comprised the bulk of net capital flows into
Turkey in the first half of 2010 while more stable foreign
direct investment amounted to a mere 9 percent, EBRD data shows.
 Turkish bonds yields <0#TRTSYSUM=IS> are trading at historic
lows after the central bank said it would hold rates steady
until late 2011 in line with a dovish inflation outlook.
 But the central bank has a patchy track record on inflation
targets, observers say. The country also remains reliant on
commodity imports and wage costs there are rising.
 
 'SHEER COMPLACENCY'
 South Africa is also likely to struggle with inflation next
year as wages rise as part of labour union settlements.
 The strength of the rand currency , now trading at
three-year highs to the dollar, is also hurting its
manufacturing sector, making it harder for the government to
wrestle down unemployment that stands stubbornly at a quarter of
the labour force.
 Consumer demand remains shaky and business confidence is
slipping. [ID:nLDE6A20V1]
 These stresses are barely reflected in market pricing: local
shares <.JTOPI> are up nearly 10 percent this year.
 ""Flows are so strong that the market seems not to be
concerned. But there are a lot of crowded positions at this
stage. Investors will take any shocks badly,"" said David Hauner,
fixed income strategist at BA-Merrill Lynch.
 In Hungary, such flows have also cushioned markets from the
immediate impact of controversial policies recently announced by
the government to cut the budget deficit.
 Led by the centre-right Fidesz party, which swept into power
this year pledging to manage the economy based on ""the popular
democratic will"", Hungary has spurned the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and drawn the ire of the European Commission with an
unorthodox policy mix that includes the rechannelling of private
pension fund assets to state coffers.
 But the cost of insuring Hungarian sovereign debt against
default has fallen to 285 bps from a mid-year high of 420 bps
for five years  while the currency has managed to
rise 5 percent  since July.
 Local shares <.BUX> trade at a forward price-to-earnings
ratio just above the 10-year average.
 ""There is sheer complacency in the markets now"", said Luis
Costa, emerging markets strategist at Citi.

 * Could try to regain support by actions in foreign affairs
 * Faces tough challenges, struggle to make a mark 
 
 By Timothy Heritage
 BRUSSELS, Nov 3 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama
could turn to foreign policy as a way to claw back popularity
after his midterm elections setback, which has left him weakened
in domestic politics.
 Obama will face pressure to adopt a more aggressive foreign
policy, such as using more force in Afghanistan and keeping
troops there longer, after Republicans made gains in the Senate
and captured the House of Representatives.
 But foreign policy is also an area where Obama could have a
relatively free hand and he is likely to start efforts to
rebuild his image abroad when he begins a trip to Asia on
Friday.
 Bill Clinton fought back to win a second term as president
after heavy Democrat losses in midterm elections in 1994, but
Obama can expect no easy victories in the foreign policy arena.
 ""One classic scenario would be that the president, having
lost his majority in Congress, would focus more on foreign
policy. This is something that Clinton did to an extent. The
problem for Obama is that there is no low-hanging fruit on
foreign policy,"" said Thomas Klau, a Paris-based analyst with
the International Council on Foreign Relations think tank.
 ""Afghanistan remains very difficult, more difficult
domestically. Neither Iran or the Middle East conflict or indeed
Pakistan or other geographical places suggest that a stronger,
more sustained personal engagement from Obama would be very
likely to usher in short-term breakthroughs or benefits.""
 Global intelligence company STRATFOR said the United States
remained the global superpower and a president who is weak at
home is not by default weak abroad.
 ""In fact, a weak president often has no options before him
except foreign policy,"" it said.
 
 WHAT ARE OBAMA'S FOREIGN POLICY OPTIONS?
 It is not clear where Obama might choose to make his mark
but he faces challenges and pressure to adopt tougher policies
almost wherever he looks.
 Waheed Omer, a spokesman for Afghan President Hamid Karzai,
said the relationship with Washington would continue regardless
of the elections and Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said
the outcome would not affect its intention to keep fighting
until all foreign forces leave Afghanistan.
 But Daoud Sultanzoy, a U.S.-educated Afghan analyst, said
Obama may have to take another look at strategy in Afghanistan,
where U.S.-led NATO troops are bogged down fighting the Taliban.
""Obama will need to reverse from some of the policies, use
some of the Republicans' values and basically reach out to them
for a bipartisan (deal),"" he said. ""The Republicans want use of
more force, longer (troop) presence and intense confrontation
with terrorism.""
 Other analysts said the Republicans could also push for a
review of policy on Pakistan.
 Pakistani political analyst Hasan Askari Rizvi said
Pakistan's government would face new pressure to crack down
harder on Afghan militants who cross the border to attack NATO
troops in Afghanistan.
 ""They will be raising more questions about the government's
performance, about cross-border movements and about why the
situation is not improving in Afghanistan,"" he said.
 Talat Masood, a retired Pakistani general and analyst, said:
""The only fear that I have is that Republicans have a far more
aggressive foreign and defence policy, which has already been
demonstrated in (former President George W.) Bush's time.""
 ""Expectations from Pakistan will increase and I expect there
will be greater demands from Pakistan to take tough action
against militants and there will be greater scrutiny,"" he said.

 MIDDLE EAST HEADACHE
 The Republicans could also try to push North Korea's nuclear
capabilities up the agenda.
 ""If anything, North Korea might find it more difficult to
get back into the negotiating framework with a stronger
Republican representation in Congress,"" said Paik Hak-soon of
the Sejong Institute near Seoul in South Korea.
 A headache looms for Obama in the Middle East, where former
Israeli diplomat Yoram Ettinger said the election outcome had
strengthened pro-Israeli elements in Washington.
 ""This is going to constrain immensely the manoeuvrability of
the president, who is generally pretty critical (even) negative
towards Israel, which would require the president, in my mind,
to limit his pressure on Israel,"" he said.
 One country where the heat could be turned down is China
because the elections delivered a business-friendly Congress.
Democrats accused China during the campaign of taking U.S. jobs
by suppressing the value of its currency and rigging its economy
to favour Chinese state firms.
 In Europe, the Republican gains could help sharpen the
divergence with the U.S. government on financial regulation,
climate change and aspects of foreign policy.
 Ruprecht Polenz, head of the lower house of parliament's
foreign affairs committee in Germany, said it would now be more
difficult to secure U.S. ratification of the START disarmament
treaty with Russia and Washington would be more self-absorbed.
 ""It is on the whole not a good thing for the world. No major
international conflict can be resolved without the United
States. So we must be ready for Europe to engage more boldly (in
global diplomacy),"" he said.

 By Samantha Pearson and Froilan Romero
 SAO PAULO/SANTIAGO, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Brazil's currency
surged on Wednesday while Mexico's peso hit a 6-month high
ahead of a likely announcement on monetary stimulus measures in
the United States.
 The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce after
2:15 p.m. EDT (1815 GMT) asset purchases of at least $500
billion via quantitative easing -- in effect printing money to
buy bonds and lower borrowing costs. For more, see:
[ID:nLDE6A2062]
 That should keep yields on U.S. Treasuries close to record
lows, encouraging investors to buy Latin America's
higher-yielding bonds.
 Brazil is a prime target because the country's benchmark
interest rate of 10.75 percent is one of the highest in the
world.
 The Brazilian real  surged as much as 1.1 percent in
early trading on Wednesday and was later up 0.76 percent at
1.693 reais per U.S. dollar on the local spot market.
 The real was also pricing in the region's gains on Tuesday,
when Brazil's markets were closed for a public holiday.
 ""The market was shut yesterday, so there was a movement in
other currencies that the real wasn't able to follow. But to a
great extent, (the real is stronger) in anticipation of the
results of the Fed meeting,"" said Marianna Costa, an economist
with Link Investimentos in Sao Paulo.
 ""Anything close to $500 billion is already priced into the
market. If it was something closer to $1 trillion, there could
be some more space for appreciation. If it is less (than $500
billion), the market, like everywhere else in the world, is not
going to take it well.""
 The Mexican currency  edged up to its strongest level
since May 3, later trading 0.14 percent stronger at 12.2875 per
dollar.
 ""I believe the Fed will move to purchase the expected $500
billion in bonds and the peso won't see a huge move after the
announcement,"" said Alfredo Puig, a trader at Vector brokerage
in Monterrey, Mexico.
 But if the amount is less than expected, the currency could
rapidly weaken to 12.38, he added.
 Some economists say the peso could outperform the region's
other currencies in the months ahead because of the country's
hands-off approach to its currency market. [ID:nN0147422]
 WAITING TO STRIKE
 Other governments across the region have taken a series of
intervention measures, such as dollar purchases and capital
controls, to slow rallies in their local currencies.
 A stronger currency makes exports more expensive abroad and
can cause long-term damage to a country's economy.
 Fears of new measures hit the Chilean peso  on
Wednesday. It weakened 0.12 percent to 487.6 per dollar.
[ID:nN30113748]
 ""There are rumors in the market that after the Fed's
decision, some new measures will be taken here to curb the
peso,"" said one trader in Santiago.
 The peso has strengthened 12 percent since the end of June
as the country has recovered rapidly from a devastating
earthquake in February.
 President Sebastian Pinera said last week his government is
working to open capital accounts and relax limits on
investments abroad to battle the peso's appreciation.
 Analysts say the central bank may also go back to buying
dollars in the market or find others ways to encourage capital
outflows. [ID:nN20242719]

 * Too many costs, too few taxpayers
 * Money returned due to lack of planning
 
 By Jon Herskovitz
 JOHANNESBURG, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The massive funds South
Africa sets aside to fix its schools and heal its health care
system might be more effective if bureaucrats spent the money on
properly run programmes and not on luxury cars.
 In its three-year budget policy statement last week, the
National Treasury said too much money was lost due to
incompetence, suspected corruption and inefficiency, harming the
long-term prospects for Africa's largest economy.
 ""South Africa needs a culture of responsible stewardship of
public resources geared toward obtaining better quality
frontline services for every rand spent,"" it said.
 The Treasury, widely praised by economists for its fiscal
prudence, has tried to set an example of efficient operations
and the government has set up a task force to cut costs, but few
think the country can quickly change its ways.
 ""There is not enough management skill or general policy
implementation skill in government ministries and local
departments to effectively use the money,"" said Gary van Staden,
political analyst with NKC, a group of independent economists.
 But the Treasury needs maximum efficiency because some basic
numbers do not stack up in its favour.
 It has to provide money for the nearly 14 million receiving
social grants and welfare services. But with about 13 million in
the workforce and only about 6 million earning enough money to
pay income taxes, its sources of revenue are constrained.
 It spends about 40 percent of its tax revenue on personnel
costs for state employees, leaving little over for other
priorities.
 Even so, the government has spent hundreds of billions of
dollars since the end of apartheid 16 years ago to provide
houses, electricity and basic schools to millions living in
crippling poverty. The results have not been promising.
 The African economic power ranks near last in the world in
terms of the quality of its education system, health care
provision and its police, according to the World Economic
Forum's Global Competitiveness Report.
 ""There are too many departments where administrative
capacity is excessive or inefficient,"" Finance Minister Pravin
Gordhan told parliament last week.
 
 COSTLY RIDES
 The committee to slash state spending said it sees
low-hanging fruit of at least 27 billion rand a year it can cut,
with additional savings coming from greater fiscal discipline.
 The country has also had its share of white elephants
costing billions of dollars, such as a post-apartheid plan to
overhaul the curriculum at its schools that was dropped earlier
this year despite the hefty spending on its implementation.
 Wasteful spending by ministers has caused outrage among the
public, and President Jacob Zuma earned some praise this week by
sacking seven ministers seen as not up to the job or as being
financially irresponsible.
 Those removed included Siphiwe Nyanda, a communications
ministers who has been lambasted in the media for spending more
than 1.1 million rand ($160,000) each on two, top of the line
German sedans for his use.
 Even when the Treasury allocates money, it still faces the
problem of having some of the funds returned because local
officials cannot draw up plans to spend the cash.
 During 2009/10, some 12.4 billion rand allocated for capital
projects was unspent, the Treasury said.

 By Leigh Thomas
 PARIS, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Central banks in the United States
and the euro zone should only return monetary policy to more
normal settings in 2012 due to weak economic growth, the OECD
said on Wednesday.
 The United States and the 16-country euro area should wait
even longer to normalise interest rates if growth turned out
weaker than expected, the OECD said in a set of policy
recommendations.
 ""Because of weak growth in the U.S. and euro area, and
provided that inflation expectations remain well anchored, the
normalisation of interest rates should only proceed in earnest
from the first half of 2012, at a pace that allows monetary
policy to remain accommodating,"" said a statement published by
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
 Turning to Japan, the OECD said in its recommendations that
if the country remained mired in deflation then ""rates could
remain at current low levels throughout 2011 and 2012, and
further exceptional easing should be implemented to give
stimulus to the economy.""
 Japan cut interest rates virtually to zero last month.
 ""The immediate challenge for the monetary authorities is to
get the timing for the exit from exceptional stimulus right,""
OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria told a news conference hours
before the U.S. Federal Reserve was expected to announce plans
to buy billions dollars more of government bonds with new money
in a bid to revive a struggling economy.
 In a preview of detailed forecasts for its members'
economies, which it will issue on Nov. 18, the Paris-based
organisation estimated that the United States economy was set to
grow 2.5-3.0 percent this year before slowing to a rate of
1.75-2.25 percent next year.
 The euro zone economy was projected to grow 1.5-2.0 in both
2010 and 2011.
 Japan's economy was forecast to grow 2.75-3.25 percent this
year and slow to growth next year of 1.5-2.0 percent in 2011.
 The OECD said ultra-low interest rates at the biggest
central banks were driving flows of capital into faster growing
emerging markets, lifting their exchange rates and prices for
real estate and stocks.
 OECD chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan told the news
conference that some governments' efforts to keep capital from
flooding in could ""generate a non-cooperative environment and
possibly also protectionist measures that add a drag on growth"".
 With its members' economies still weak, the organisation
said governments' efforts to improve strained public
finances should focus on cutting unproductive spending, although
""it may be impossible to avoid tax increases"".
 The OECD also recommended governments adopt targets for
limiting their debt as a percentage of gross domestic product
and setting up independent fiscal watchdogs to track their
efforts.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Wednesday,
boosted by better-than-forecast U.S. private payrolls data, but
trading was confined to narrow ranges as markets awaited a
Federal Reserve decision to further ease monetary policy.
 The expected Fed announcement may push Treasury debt yields
lower and diminish the appeal of some U.S. assets, although
analysts said the decision has been pretty much priced into the
market the last few sessions.
 ""I don't think many people would want to make waves ahead
of the Fed announcement this afternoon,"" said Ron Simpson,
director of currency research at Action Economics in Tampa,
Florida.
 ""For the most part, some form of quantitative easing has
been priced in by the market. In my mind, the risk after the
announcement for the dollar is to the upside only because the
the dollar has been sold so much against most currencies.""
 Markets were generally priced for the Fed initially to
commit to buying at least $500 billion in Treasuries over five
months in a fresh bout of quantitative easing, but traders were
eager for details of the scope and pace of bond purchases.
 Ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee statement,
traders said option expiries are expected to dictate price
action.
 In early morning trading, the euro  was slightly
lower at $1.4016, held in a $1.4000-50 range for much of the
session. Option expiries at $1.4000 and $1.4050 later in the
day were seen influencing intraday price action.
 The dollar rose 0.7 percent against the yen to 81.13
, within striking distance of this week's 15-year low
of 80.21, according to electronic trading platform EBS. The
all-time low of 79.95 yen was also in focus as the market
stayed sensitive to the potential for fresh Japanese
intervention to stem the yen's rise.
 Gains in dollar/yen were helped by U.S. data showing
private sector payrolls rose 43,000 last month, with
September's figures revised upward. For the report click on

 Sterling  hit a nine-month high of $1.6157 after
stronger-than-expected UK services sector activity data added
to the view that the Bank of England may not implement more QE
any time soon. [ID:nLDE6A20TQ] Sterling last traded up 0.3
percent at $1.6096.
 Traders also said liquidity had dried up since the start of
the week, with one trader in London saying his turnover in the
past two days had been the lowest in five years.
 He added the market was expecting the Fed announcement to
offer more clarity on whether the dollar's latest sell-off
since September would continue through the end of 2010.
 ""Irrespective of recent ratcheting down of Fed QE2
expectations from $1 trillion to $500 billion, a likely
open-ended approach (of say $100 billion per month) should in
our view keep (the dollar) on a depreciation path,"" said Tom
Levinson, currency strategist at ING in a note to clients.
 ""An absence of BOJ asset purchases of a similar scale
together with USD/JPY's strong correlation with U.S. Treasury
yields will keep the former biased lower.""

 By Mia Shanley
 REYKJAVIK, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Iceland's central bank cut
interest rates more than expected on Wednesday and signalled it
would not ease capital controls further until at least next
March as it tries to drag the economy back onto its feet.
 Analysts had expected the central bank to cut rates to give
further relief to a domestic economy still struggling to recover
in the aftermath of the country's worst-ever recession.
 But the 75 basis point cut, bringing the main rate to 5.50
percent, was more than many had expected. 
 It came after a further stabilisation of the country's crown
currency and a fall off in price increases in the hard-hit north
Atlantic nation, still suffering from weak economic activity and
high levels of debt.
 ""The inflation outlook and the slack in the economy ...
indicate that there is continued scope for reduction of central
bank interest rates,"" the Sedlabanki said in a statement.
 It also cut its deposit rate to 4.00 percent from 4.75
percent.
 There had been some speculation of a further easing of
capital controls -- put in place during the crisis to protect
the crown -- but the bank said no fundamental changes would be
made to current rules on outflows before March 2011.
 That gives it time to assess whether the currency is strong
enough to live with the lower risk premium for investing in
Iceland implied by lower official interest rates.
 ""Given that the issue of a potential shortfall in the
capital position of the banking system might not be fully
addressed until year-end, it is not realistic that any other
steps than those described ... will be taken to lift the
controls on outflows this year,"" Sedlabanki said.
 PREPARATION
 Still reeling from its worst-ever financial downturn after
its top banks collapsed under a mountain of debt, Iceland is
grappling with high corporate and household debt.
 Many companies have had good cash flow thanks to a rebound
in exports but are still highly indebted and wary of making
investments while many homeowners are struggling to pay down
inflation-linked mortgages which have surged in line with a
higher consumer price index.
 As looser controls on capital edge closer two years after
the collapse of the country's financial system, Sedlabanki said
it could take certain steps to prepare for a more comprehensive
lifting of controls on outflows.
 These could include measures to allow offshore crowns to be
swapped in auctions with foreign assets held by domestic
residents. They could also allow investments in targeted
long-term ventures or specific projects in Iceland.
 Analysts said it appeared there was still not enough trust
in the country's banking sector, which some say have been too
slow to restructure household and corporate balance sheets.
 ""In our opinion this means that the central bank will
continue to lower interest rates to try and stimulate the
economy and avoid deflation, whilst also lowering the appeal of
the ISK to carry-trade speculators before capital controls are
removed,"" IGM said in a note to clients.
 The bank has loosened monetary policy gradually over the
past several quarters from a record 18 percent last year as the
North Atlantic island recovers.
""They have been quite aggressive, so they are continuing on
that path,"" said a forex dealer in Stockholm.

 By Aija Braslina
 RIGA, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Latvia's parliament approved on
Wednesday a second term for Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis as
he seeks to push through harsh budget cuts to restore economic
health under the terms of an international bailout plan. 
 Latvia's economy contracted by 18 percent last year, making
it the worst-affected in Europe by the global downturn.
 To stabilise its finances Latvia secured a 7.5-billion-euro
($10.5 billion) rescue package led by the International Monetary
Fund and the European Union, under which it pledged to implement
harsh austerity measures.
 ""There are hard and unpopular decisions ahead for the next
government,"" Dombrovskis told parliament.
 ""A vote to approve the government is also a decision about
further implementation and successful completion of Latvia's
economic stabilisation programme.""
 His previous government slashed public sector pay by 50
percent, reduced pensions and closed hospitals and schools to
bring government finances under control. 
 The economy is now recovering and ratings agency Fitch
recently upgraded its credit rating outlook. But the new
government still needs to bring down spending.
 The first priority for the new government, which controls 55
seats in the 100-seat assembly after the Oct. 2 election, will
be to draft a 2011 budget which could include cuts of around 400
million lats ($790 million). 
 ""We will start work on the budget already next week,""
Dombrovskis told journalists after getting the nod from
parliament. 
 He said the latest batch of macroeconomic data will be
released next week, after which the government will be able to
decide how much it has to cut to bring the budget deficit down
to 6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) from a planned 8.5
percent this year. 
 Dombrovskis said the government would cut the budget deficit
further to 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2012 as it
aims to join the eurozone in 2014. 
 The road ahead is likely to be tough.
 ""This partnership for both -- Unity bloc and Union of
Farmers and Greens -- will be hard because 55 seats is a slim
majority,"" Unity bloc board member Dzintars Zakis told
journalists on Wednesday.
 However, opposition parties have said they may back some of
the government's initiatives. The Nationalist bloc, with eight
seats in parliament, said in a press release they supported
Dombrovskis and the targets set by the new government.

 By Jack Kim
 SEOUL, Nov 3 (Reuters) - South Korean President Lee
Myung-bak said on Wednesday the United States will be sending
an important message on its commitment to free trade if it
finally advances a pact it signed with Seoul on opening their
markets.
 The two sides are working to conclude discussions
addressing U.S. industry concerns that a free trade deal signed
three years ago does not do enough to open South Korean markets
to U.S. autos and beef.
 ""I believe concluding the South Korean-U.S. FTA carries an
important message on free trade as far as the U.S. position is
concerned,"" Lee told a news conference.
 The pact is the largest signed by the United States since
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that went into
force in 1994, and some South Korean studies said it could
boost $78 billion U.S.-South Korea bilateral trade by as much
as a quarter.
 Lee added that he and U.S. President Barack Obama were in
agreement it would be in the two countries' interest to
conclude discussions as soon as possible.
 Lee and Obama hoped to resolve outstanding issues by the
time the two leaders meet in Seoul next week on the sidelines
of a two-day G20 summit, he said.
 ""We already have an agreement so I don't believe it should
be very complicated,"" Lee said. ""If the trade ministers of the
two countries look at what is in our mutual interest, then I
think there is a chance. I'm positive about this.""
 The United States and South Korea must thrash out issues
connected with trade in beef and autos that have blocked U.S.
congressional approval of the pact, which has been delayed
because of some U.S. lawmakers' objections.
 Senior trade officials from the two sides will meet in
Seoul beginning on Thursday to try to resolve outstanding
issues, and the talks now scheduled for two days could go on
for more, South Korea's trade ministry said later on Wednesday.
 The two sides are also planning to arrange a meeting for
South Korean Minister for Trade Kim Jong-hoon and U.S. Trade
Representative Ron Kirk, it said.
 South Korean officials have said Seoul was opposed to
making any changes to the pact itself but was willing to listen
to U.S. industry concerns.
 The deal has broad support among South Korea's ruling Grand
National Party but has yet to be approved by the country's
unicameral assembly. The country's small but politically
powerful farm lobby is opposed to the deal.
 The U.S. International Trade Commission has estimated the
pact would boost annual U.S. exports to South Korea by about
$9.7 billion to $10.9 billion, primarily in agricultural
products, machinery, electronics and transportation equipment,
including passenger vehicles and parts.
 It projected U.S. imports from South Korea to increase $6.4
billion to $6.9 billion, primarily in textiles, apparel,
leather products, footwear, machinery, electronics, and
passenger vehicles and parts.
 U.S. exports to South Korea totalled $28.6 billion in 2009
and its imports from that country were $39.2 billion.

 LONDON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The dollar edged lower on
Wednesday as the Federal Reserve looked set to add more stimulus
to spur a flagging recovery, a move analysts said would weigh on
U.S. yields and ultimately put more pressure on the greenback.
 Currency movements were subdued as investors were unwilling
to make new bets ahead of the U.S. central bank's policy
decision due at around 1815 GMT, with option expiries expected
to dictate price action.
 Markets were generally priced for the Fed initially to

 ""There is uncertainty over the details of the Fed

Schmidt, currency strategist at Lloyds Banking Group.
 The dollar slipped as much as 0.2 percent versus a currency

 Against the yen, the dollar stood at 80.62 yen, unchanged on
the day, as a Japanese holiday led to subdued trading, but the
outlook was still skewed to the downside.

elections was relatively muted as investors have largely priced
in the outcome and shifted focus to the Fed meeting.
 U.S. Treasuries also extended gains in European trading as
market participants anticipated the Fed resuming asset
purchases. The T-note future  rose by as much as 8/32 on

 LONDON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The dollar held steady on
Wednesday as the Federal Reserve looked set to add more stimulus
to spur a flagging recovery, a move analysts said would weigh on
U.S. yields and ultimately put more pressure on the greenback.
 Traders said the market was unwilling to make new bets ahead
of the U.S. central bank's policy decision due at around 1815
GMT, with option expiries expected to dictate price action.
 Markets are generally priced for the Fed initially to commit
to buying at least $500 billion in Treasuries over five months,
although much uncertainty surrounds the scope and pace of bond
purchases.
 ""There is uncertainty over the details of the Fed
announcement but ultimately QE leads to lower yields and should
mean the dollar goes down in the long-term,"" said Adrian
Schmidt, currency strategist at Lloyds Banking Group.
 The dollar was flat versus a currency basket at 76.714. The
euro was also steady around $1.4030, with traders highlighting
option expiries at $1.3990, $1.4000 and $1.4050 which they said
were likely to influence price action on the day.
 Against the yen, the dollar stood at 80.62 yen, unchanged on
the day, as a Japanese holiday led to subdued trading, but the
outlook was still skewed to the downside.
 ""Irrespective of recent ratcheting down of Fed QE2
expectations from $1 trillion to $500 billion, a likely
open-ended approach (of say $100 billion per month) should in
our view keep (the dollar) on a depreciation path,"" said Tom
Levinson, currency strategist at ING in a note to clients.
 ""An absence of BOJ asset purchases of a similar scale
together with USD/JPY's strong correlation with U.S. Treasury
yields will keep the former biased lower.""
 Dollar/yen hovered close to this week's 15-year low of
80.21, with all-time lows at 79.75 also close by, as the market
stayed sensitive to potential for fresh Japanese intervention to
stem the yen's rise.
 After a fall overnight, however, the U.S. dollar showed
signs of steadying, with traders saying the Republicans' seizing
control of the U.S. House of Representatives in midterm
elections would provide some support. The Democrats were set to
hang on to the Senate, according to television projections.
 Some analysts said a split Congress may act as a curb on
government spending and lead to less government regulation. 
 The high-flying Australian dollar retreated after a surprise
6.6 percent drop in building approvals, a day after the Reserve
Bank lifted interest rates in a pre-emptive strike against
inflation.
 The Aussie, which hit a 28-year high of $1.0025 on Tuesday,
recoiled to $0.9979.
 Immediate support was seen at the $0.9910 area, Monday's
high, a breach of which could see the currency back in
consolidation mode between $0.9650 and $0.9850.

 * Villagers complain of sickness, lost crops
 * Export quotas alone not staunching pollution
 By Chris Buckley
 BAOTOU China, Nov 3 (Reuters) - China's quest for a green
future built on rare earths metals seems a world away from Ren
Limin as he casts lumps of one of the metals in a
chemical-spattered shed thick with acrid fumes.
 Ren tends cauldrons of sputtering acid, additives and ore
in a shed in north China's Inner Mongolia region, smelting
lanthanum, one of the 17 rare earths that Beijing hopes will
power the nation up the clean technology ladder.
 Yet Ren and a workmate use few safety protections as they
stir and poke the red-hot cauldrons. Holes in the roof and
windows act as main ventilation.
 ""This place doesn't have anything but it's got mines. We
live off the rare earth mines,"" Ren, who gave his age as 32 but
looked years older, told Reuters journalists who visited
Baotou, a city of 1.8 million people about 650 kilometres (404
miles) west of Beijing that calls itself the ""capital of rare
earths"".
 ""It's not that dangerous. You get used to the smells, but
there's also the heat,"" he said.
 China says it must curb rare earth ore sales abroad for the
sake of its environment, though its own rare earths industry is
marked by pollution and primitive production that tightening
export quotas alone appears unlikely to staunch.
 China supplies 97 percent of the world's rare earths, used
in computers and clean energy technology such as wind turbines
and electric cars. The battery of a Toyota Prius hybrid car
uses 10 to 15 kg (22-33 lb) of lanthanum.
 Beijing has sparked international concerns by curbing
exports of rare earths which it says it needs for its own green
growth.
 Ren was unaware of the diplomatic fuss and met questions
about environmental and health problems linked to production
with gruff bemusement.
 ""We sell it on. That's all I know. I'm not sure who buys it
or what it's for,"" he said of a pile of lanthanum bricks lying
on the floor, among discarded cotton gloves and scrap.
 He worked without a mask but wrapped a towel around his
face and donned a visor when pouring the molten compound into
molds.
 He said they made 1,100 yuan ($165) a tonne, working
12-hour days, with a few days off every two weeks.
 The plant he works in lies in a northern corner of Baotou,
a city and surrounding expanse of Inner Mongolia that produces
more than half of the world's rare earths, especially the
lighter ones, from the fenced-off Bayan Obo mines.
 The government says it wants to end unfettered exploitation
of rare earths, and has been shutting unlicensed mines and
smelters. But China's biggest producers still pollute at levels
far beyond what would be allowed in the United States,
Australia and other countries now looking to ramp up production
as Beijing curbs exports.
 Near Baotou city, where Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Group
processes the metals on a vast scale, villagers said the
resulting toxins were poisoning them, their water and air,
crops and children. At least one official has backed that
claim.
 ""If we take into account the resource and environmental
costs, the progress of the rare earths industry has come at a
massive price to society,"" Su Wenqing, a Baotou rare earths
industry official wrote in a study published last year.
 THE ""MIDDLE EAST"" OF RARE EARTHS
 Baotou wants to remake itself as a crucible of China's
ambitions to turn its rare earths into green-tinged gold.
 The city has a rare earths high-tech zone, a shiny Rare
Earths Tower for officials and investors, and Rare Earths
Street.
 The city's Rare Earths Park features carvings of scientists
and leaders who pushed China to turn its reserves into an
engine for economic growth, including Deng Xiaoping, the
revolutionary veteran who guided the nation to market economic
reforms.
 ""The Middle East has oil, and China has rare earths,"" a
carving records Deng as saying in 1992.
 ""China's rare earths resources can be likened in importance
to the Middle East's oil. They have immense strategic
significance and we must certainly deal with rare earths issues
with care, unleashing the advantages they bring.""
 The Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Group is at the heart of
China's ambitions to turn rare earths into a lucrative
ingredient of growth. It dominates rare earths production in
Inner Mongolia, where most of the ores come out of the ground
mixed with iron ore, which is the parent company Baotou Steel's
main business.
 China wants enough rare earths for its expansion into clean
technology, especially advanced wind turbines, hybrid and
electric vehicles and other innovations.
 Minutes from the mines of Bayan Obo north of Baotou city,
hundreds of wind turbines jut above the grasslands, their three
blades and parts using rare earths in compounds that give them
strength and lightness.
 ""MOTHER SHIP"" BESET BY POLLUTION
 At the heart of Baotou's rare earths smelting, those
environmental aspirations are blighted by pollution that can
cut visibility around the main plants to a few dozen metres.
 Su Wenqing, the Baotou industry official, wrote that
companies there had dumped tailings, including mildly
radioactive ore scrap, into local water supplies and farmland
and the nearby Yellow River, ""creating varying levels of
radioactive pollution.""
 Repeated faxes and phone call inquiries to Baogang city
authorities and Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Group were not
answered.
 The outer walls of the Huamei plant proclaim its ambitions
to become the ""mother ship"" of Chinese rare earths production.
 But villagers near the rare earths plant live in a blanket
of fumes, a constant reminder of how much China still allows
near-unfettered industrial growth.
 Separating out the minerals is usually done by dousing the
rare earths in acids and other chemicals. The tailings from
Huamei and other nearby metals plants end up at a 10 square
kilometre dam.
 The reservoir can hold 230 million cubic metres of the
dark, acrid waste. That, according to a sign on its banks, is
equal to 92,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.
 The residents of Xinguang village said the chemicals from
the dam have been seeping into the underground waters that feed
their wells, crops and livestock, including fluoride.
 They complained of nausea, dizzy spells, arthritis,
migraines, wobbly joints and slow-healing injuries.
 ""The pollution is too much for even our crops to grow, and
a lot is from the rare earths plants,"" said Wu Leiji, a
ruddy-faced farmer. ""It's not getting any better. In fact, it's
worse.""
 ""Look at the kids. They're the worst off. What will all
this pollution do them?""
 A report last month in a Chinese newspaper, the Yangcheng
Evening News, cited experts supporting the villagers'
complaints of damaged health from rare earths and other
smelting pollution.
 ""When we boil the water to drink, this white scum forms on
top and it tastes bitter,"" said Guo Gang, a 58-year-old farmer.
 ""We used to grow vegetables, but now all we can grow is
corn, and even the crops for that are far smaller than 10 years
ago.""

870,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2010 10:32PM ET</span>",S.Korea's Lee says trade deal key test of U.S. will," SEOUL, Nov 3 (Reuters) - South Korean President Lee
Myung-bak said on Wednesday the United States will be sending
an important message on its commitment to free trade if it
finally advances a pact it signed with Seoul on opening their
markets.
 The two sides are working to conclude discussions
addressing U.S. industry concerns that a free trade deal signed
three years ago does not do enough to open South Korean markets
to U.S. autos and beef.
 ""I believe concluding the South Korean-U.S. FTA carries an
important message on free trade as far as the U.S. position is
concerned,"" Lee told a news conference.
 Lee added that he and U.S. President Barack Obama were in
agreement it would be in the two countries' interest to
conclude discussions at the earliest.
 Lee and Obama hoped to resolve outstanding issues by the
time the two leaders meet in Seoul next week on the sidelines
of a two-day G20 summit.
 ""We already have an agreement so I don't believe it should
be very complicated,"" Lee said. ""If the trade ministers of the
two countries look at what is in our mutual interest, then I
think there is a chance. I'm positive about this.""
 The United States and South Korea must thrash out issues
connected with trade in beef and autos that have blocked U.S.
congressional approval of the pact, which has been delayed
because of some U.S. lawmakers' objections.
 South Korean officials have said Seoul is opposed to making
any changes to the pact itself but is willing to listen to U.S.
industry concerns.
 The deal has broad support among South Korea's ruling Grand
National Party but has yet to be approved by the country's
unicameral assembly. The country's small but politically
powerful farm lobby is opposed to the deal.

 By Yoo Choonsik and Jeremy Laurence
 SEOUL, Nov 3 (Reuters) - South Korean President Lee
Myung-bak said on Wednesday he hopes G20 leaders will agree on
how to draw up current account ""guidelines"" aimed at easing
global imbalances but admitted a severe standoff between the
major economies.
 Lee, who will host the Nov. 11-12 summit of leaders from
the Group of 20 major economies in Seoul, praised China's
cooperation in reaching an agreement between the finance
ministers and central bank governors last month to avert a
""currency war"".
 ""I think countries that are having a severe standoff such
as the United States, Europe and China will be able to reach an
agreement on the basis of the principles adopted in Gyeongju,""
Lee told a televised news conference.
 Finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the G20
economies agreed late last month in the South Korean city of
Gyeongju to shun competitive currency devaluations although
they stopped short of setting targets to reduce trade
imbalances.
 The United States had proposed limiting each country's
current account surplus or deficit within 4 percent of its
annual gross domestic product, but this was resisted by big
exporters like Germany and Japan.
 Analysts say however that U.S. President Barack Obama's
room to negotiate will be severely hampered by losses in the
U.S. mid-term elections where Democrats were swept from power
in the House of Representatives.
 A senior U.S. Treasury official said on Tuesday that U.S.
would seek support from Pacific Rim finance ministers for
""concrete guidelines"" to limit trade imbalances this weekend in
hopes that G20 leaders can hammer out final language.
 He said the leaders would try to adopt detailed plans on
strengthening the global financial safety nets by diversifying
the funding mechanisms away from the International Monetary
Fund's lending facilities and helping poor nations develop.
 ""The development agenda (promoted by South Korea) is aimed
at helping strengthening the growth potentials and the ability
to grow,"" he said, referring to his country's proposal to find
alternative ways of helping develop poor nations.
 On the pending ratification of a free trade agreement with
the United States, Lee said the U.S. would be sending an
important message on its commitment to free trade if the two
countries finally advance a pact signed three years ago.
 ""I believe concluding the South Korean-U.S. FTA carries an
important message on free trade as far as the U.S. position is
concerned,"" he said, while reaffirming that he hopes to
finalise the deal through a meeting with Omaba on the sidelines
of the G20 summit.

 By Magdalena Morales
 BUENOS AIRES, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Brazil's strong currency is
giving a competitive edge to the export sector in neighboring
Argentina, helping to fuel an economic boom that could hit 9.0
percent this year.
 Brazil's currency, the real , has risen about 6.0
percent since June to two-year highs against the U.S. dollar,
making Argentine manufactured goods such as cars and auto parts
more attractive to Brazilian buyers.
 Some 85 percent of Argentina's auto exports go to Brazil.
 Pushed by sectors such as steelmaking, oil and banking,
Argentina's Merval <.MERV> stock index rose 1.85 percent on
Tuesday to an intraday record of 3,133.95 points. The index is
up 33.8 percent so far this year.
 The one-two punch of strong Brazilian demand -- the economy
there is set to grow more than 7.0 percent in 2010 -- and
Argentina's policy of keeping its peso relatively weak is seen
compensating for high consumer prices that are jacking up
company costs.
 ""The only thing that the Argentine economy would not be
able to handle would be a weakening of the real. And I don't
think that will happen,"" said economist Javier Gonzalez Fraga,
an Argentine economist and former central bank chief.
 Indeed, all of Brazil's efforts at controlling the strength
of the real, including tax increases on foreign capital, have
failed so far.
 On the Brazil's side of the border, officials worry that
the strong real is opening the floodgates to cheap Chinese
imports. The government has sought to curb the real's rally by
tripling a tax on foreign purchases of local bonds aimed at
slowing the flow of foreign capital into Brazil.
 But the measures have had little effect.
 Brazil is expected to take more steps in the weeks ahead to
tame the local currency. Incoming president Dilma Rousseff,
elected on Sunday, admits that the strong real is a problem for
Brazil but says her government will not ""manipulate"" the
foreign exchange market to control the local currency.
 Brazil and Argentina are the two biggest members of South
America's Mercosur trade block, under which tariffs have been
lowered, giving Argentina another advantage when it comes to
importing into Brazil.

 Argentina's economy is expected by the government to expand
9 percent in 2010, driven by a boom in agricultural commodities
prices.
 Argentina has issued billions of dollars in GDP warrants,
which repay investors at a rate linked to the country's gross
domestic product growth. The boom is making the warrants more
attractive and providing higher returns for holders.
 The country's inflation rate has increased in recent months
and could reach 27 percent this year, according to private
estimates, which would be the highest rate in Latin America
after Venezuela.
 As inflation rises, the government may be tempted to push
the peso even lower. But the risk of excessive currency
weakness would be capital flight, which could cut into bank
deposits and reduce the ability of financial institutions to
lend money and act as a motor for investment and growth.
 The peso trades at about 4.00 to the dollar, controlled by
central bank interventions, while the real has flown to 1.7 per
greenback as Brazil emerges as one of the world's top
investment destinations thanks to sky-high interest rates.
 ""Argentina has a huge competitive advantage due to the
difference in exchange rates. But, eventually, high inflation
in Argentina will make that advantage go away,"" said Jim
Barrineau, a New York-based strategist for ICE Canyon, a $2
billion emerging markets hedge fund.
 Argentina has long backed state intervention in the economy
to stoke growth and avoid volatility. Argentina's central bank
buys or sell dollars on the local market nearly every day to
keep the peso  steady and help spur exports.
 ""We are doing well thanks to Brazil,"" said Buenos
Aires-based trade expert Raul Ochoa, ""But that's not a
sustainable policy over time.""
 Last month Argentine central bank President Mercedes Marco
del Pont said Argentina will continue to protect its economy in
2011 by intervening in foreign exchange markets, accumulating
foreign reserves and controlling capital flows.
 For now, the trade numbers look good. The Argentine
government forecasts the trade surplus of $12.73 billion this
year and a surplus of $9.68 billion in 2011.
 ""Exchange rate stability is the only variable that is
containing the rest of the big distortions that Argentina has
on the fiscal and monetary side,"" said local economist Jorge
Todesca.

(Updates to close)
 Claire Sibonney
 TORONTO, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Canada's currency climbed to
within a cent of parity with the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, as
markets bet the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon deliver a hefty
dose of monetary easing, which could further weaken the
greenback.
 Markets are generally priced for the U.S. central bank on
Wednesday to commit to buying between $80 billion and $100
billion worth of assets per month under a new program to
bolster the struggling economy. [ID:nNLLRLE6LL]
[ID:nN02172993]
 ""If it's significantly more aggressive than that, we could
see another round of U.S. dollar selling, and that could very
easily push dollar/CAD back to parity or even beyond,"" said
Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital
Markets.
 The Canadian dollar  rose as high as C$1.0081 to
the U.S. dollar, or 99.20 U.S. cents, its strongest level in
more than two weeks. It eased slightly to finish at C$1.0095 to
the U.S. dollar, or 99.06 U.S. cents, up from C$1.0161 to the
U.S. dollar, or 98.42 U.S cents, at Monday's close.
 Earlier, the Canadian dollar got an extra lift from
Australia's surprising interest rate hike and some positive
economic news in the euro zone, as well as media speculation
regarding BHP Billiton's  hostile $39 billion bid for
Potash Corp . [ID:nN02206060]
 The currency pushed above parity with the U.S. dollar last
month but had no staying power, partly because the Bank of
Canada's last policy statement was more dovish than some had
expected.
 ""We're just a penny shy of parity once again. What's going
to push us over? There's no shortage of event risks and
developments over the next few days that could,"" said Eric
Lascelles, chief Canada macro strategist, at TD Securities.
 Fears over a further U.S. dollar selloff were also
accentuated by Bill Gross, the manager of Pimco, the world's
largest bond fund, who told Reuters the U.S. currency is in
danger of losing 20 percent of its value over the next few
years if the Fed creates huge amounts of new money in a bid to
revive the economy. [ID:nN01175131]
 Investors also awaited the results of U.S. midterm
elections on Tuesday and some analysts said a Republican win
could be positive for the U.S. currency on hopes for more
fiscal austerity and reduced government regulation.
 ""The market has already largely priced in a House that will
be in Republican control, maybe even a Senate in Republican
control, so I think the impact from the elections on the
markets will be very limited,"" Strauss noted.
 ""Going forward ... it will have implications for 2011
regarding fiscal policy and the likelihood of another stimulus
package,"" he said.
 This week's events pose strong potential for market swings
as investors will also absorb policy decisions from other
central banks and U.S. and Canadian monthly jobs data, due on
Friday.
 Strauss said, near term, a key support level for the U.S.
dollar versus Canada was C$0.9981, and resistance is seen at
C$1.0157.
 BONDS DIP
 Canadian government bond prices were mostly lower, taking a
wait-and-see approach ahead of Wednesday's Fed's decision. U.S.
Treasury prices rose in light volume as investors took
advantage of a recent rise in yields and covered short
positions. [US/]
 Fixed income strategists have said that while the prospect
of quantitative easing has recently pushed yields lower, that
has largely already been priced in. Although a more aggressive
move than anticipated should be met with another rally in
bonds.
 The two-year bond  fell 5 Canadian cents to
yield 1.436 percent, while the 10-year bond  shed 38
Canadian cents to yield 2.883 percent.

 By David Lawder
 WASHINGTON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The United States will seek
support from Pacific Rim finance ministers for ""concrete
guidelines"" to limit trade imbalances this weekend in hopes
that Group of 20 leaders can hammer out final language next
week in Seoul, a senior U.S. Treasury official said on
Tuesday.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner will arrive on
Saturday in Kyoto, Japan, for the meeting of finance ministers
from the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation countries.
 He will encourage APEC exporters to contribute to
rebalancing the global economy by adopting structural changes
to help reduce their current account surpluses. Buy-in from
APEC, which includes several G20 members, will make a deal on
specific goals more likely at the Seoul summit, the Treasury
official said.
 ""It's unlikely that you're going to see a major
breakthrough in terms of public commitments at APEC,"" the
official told a news briefing. ""Seoul is the main destination.
APEC is a very important step on the road.""
 G20 finance ministers in Gyeongju, South Korea, late last
month sought to defuse rising currency tensions by agreeing to
shun competitive devaluations. They also agreed on the need to
reduce ""persistently large"" current account surpluses and
deficits, but failed to agree on specific targets as a
percentage of gross domestic product.
 The United States had proposed a goal of 4 percent of GDP,
but this was resisted by several export-driven economies, such
as Germany and Japan.
 The Treasury official declined to say directly whether the
United States believes it can achieve specific numerical target
ranges for sustainable current account surpluses and deficits
at the Nov. 11-12 Seoul summit. He expects a ""vigorous debate""
on the topic.
 ""We are pushing for concrete guidelines that will provide a
basis for countries to commit to, and to provide a basis for
effective monitoring by the IMF,"" the official said. ""We would
like to have guidelines that are as concrete as possible.""
 STIFF OPPOSITION
 The United States faces stiff opposition for specific
targets. Last week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel rejected
the idea of current account targets in a speech to Germany's
parliament. Some estimates have Germany's current account
surplus rising to 6 percent next year.
 ""First of all we have to understand, that quantitative
targets for current-account imbalances can be no solution""
Merkel said. ""Current-account imbalances are an expression of
the competitiveness of economies, are the result of market
developments, and one should not interfere into these
artificially"".
 China has shown somewhat more receptiveness to the idea. Yi
Gang, a People's Bank of China vice governor, told a conference
last week that there was a ""foundation to reach agreement"" but
that China would only set targets of its own volition.
 Yi has said that China is drafting a plan to limit its
current account surplus to less than 4 percent of GDP over the
next three to five years.
 The U.S. Treasury official repeated Geithner's language
that Beijing views a more balanced economy in its interests.
 ""They understand the need to contain their current account
surplus. Their overall strategic orientation is fully
consistent with what we're trying to reach agreement on,"" the
official said.
 However, he said other nations with current account
surpluses, without citing any specific countries, must start to
consider how their policies affect the global economy and
recognize the need to limit their surpluses.
 Between the APEC meeting in Kyoto and the G20 summit in
Seoul on Nov. 11-12, Geithner will visit Delhi to join
President Barack Obama for meetings with India's leaders and
make stops in Abu Dhabi and Singapore.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell on Tuesday
after Australia's surprising interest rate hike and positive
economic news in the euro zone, but analysts warned of a
possible rebound if the Federal Reserve disappoints markets at
the end of its policy meeting on Wednesday.
 Investors also awaited the results of U.S. mid-term
elections on Tuesday. Some analysts said a Republican victory
could be positive for the U.S. currency on market hopes for
increased fiscal austerity and less government regulation.
 But most investors have looked beyond the elections and
focused instead on a two-day meeting of the U.S. central bank's
Federal Open Market Committee, which looks set to announce a
second round of monetary easing on Wednesday. For details, see
[ID:nN01141530]
 Expectations have centered around an initial commitment
from the Fed to buy at least $500 billion in Treasuries over
five months, which was less than the $1 trillion size some
traders had initially estimated. However, much uncertainty
surrounds the scope and pace of the purchases.
 ""There's every chance of a rebound in the dollar as I think
its weakness has been directly correlated to fear the Fed was
going to do something of shock-and-awe nature,"" said Alan
Wilde, head of fixed-income and currency at Baring Asset
Management in London. Baring oversees $50 billion in assets.
 Analysts said the risk of a dollar recovery is building
after the greenback has lost about 8 percent against a basket
of major currencies since the start of September on
expectations the Fed will purchase more assets, a move that
would pressure U.S. yields and diminish the return on
dollar-denominated investments.
 The U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>, which tracks the greenback
against a basket of six currencies, hit a two-week low of
76.636 and was last down 0.7 percent at 76.724.
 The euro  traded as high as $1.4058 on trading
platform EBS, buoyed by a pick-up in euro zone manufacturers'
output. [ID:nLDE6A10TX] It was last up 1.1 percent at $1.4038.
 Traders said hourly momentum in euro/dollar is bullish, but
very overbought, suggesting $1.4045/$1.4080 resistance will
likely hold in the near term. Renewed worries about euro zone's
sovereign debt issues could also limit the euro currency's
upside.
 Also on Tuesday, the Australian dollar hit a peak of
US$1.0025 , the highest since the currency was floated
in 1983. The Reserve Bank of Australia raised its cash rate by
25 basis points to 4.75 percent as a preemptive strike against
inflation.
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent to 80.68 yen , not far
from the record low of 79.75 set in 1995.
 MORE CONDITIONAL
 Aroop Chatterjee, currency strategist at Barclays Capital
in New York, said the dollar's reaction will depend not just on
the size of asset purchases, but also on the commitment of
policymakers to make the asset purchases.
 ""If the level of commitment is more conditional than what
the market expected, that would disappoint,"" he said, adding:
""U.S. data has been quite strong of late.""
 In the event of a dollar rebound, Chatterjee expects to see
""bigger"" gains against the euro, which has been ""primarily
driven by the negative dollar sentiment, rather than euro
positive news.""
 Chatterjee sees euro/dollar at $1.35 in six months and
$1.30 in 12 months.

 Steven Englander, Citigroup's head of G10 FX strategy in
New York, said another uncertainty surrounding the Fed's
program is ""what the trade-off between dissents and QE2
commitments is.""
 No dissent, he said, even with a lower-than-expected
initial commitment, will likely eventually be seen as U.S.
dollar negative as it suggests ""an agreement in principle with
respect to the need for QE2 and debate over the size.""
 In contrast, Englander said two dissents at a moderate
headline quantitative easing level will be a positive for the
dollar as it would suggest that ""there is much more internal
opposition to QE2 than the market anticipated.""

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The Colombian peso slightly
weakened on Tuesday on a series of government measures to curb
currency gains, while expectations of more U.S. monetary easing
drove Argentine and Chilean equity markets to all-time highs.
 Trading volumes were subdued, however, as financial markets
in Latin American powerhouses Brazil and Mexico were closed for
a holiday. Markets in Chile and Colombia did not operate on
Monday.
 The Colombian peso  lost 0.2 percent to 1,843.70
per U.S. dollar after the government announced on Friday it
would buy up to $3.7 billion in forwards markets during 2011,
among other measures designed to curb the strength of its
currency. For details, see [ID:nN29291838].
 ""We expected to a certain extent stronger measures by the
government on short-term foreign debt,"" said Juan Carlos
Suarez, head of research at Profesionales de Bolsa in Bogota.
 Colombia's currency has gained some 13 percent so far this
year as ultra-loose monetary policy in developed countries has
encouraged investors to seek higher yields in emerging
economies.
 The Chilean peso , on the other hand, gained 0.41
percent to 487.00 per dollar, as the greenback posted losses
globally due to prospects of further monetary easing by the
U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday.
 Expectations that the Fed may pump more liquidity into
global markets also drove stocks higher across the globe,
sending benchmark equity indexes to record highs in Argentina
and Chile.
 Chile's blue-chip IPSA index <.IPSA> jumped 1.51 percent to
a record 4.986.74 points, also boosted by prospects of strong
third-quarter earnings.
 Shares of energy and wood pulp conglomerate Copec ,
the index's top-weighted stock, jumped 3.39 percent to 9,521.00
Chilean pesos.
 ""Since last week retail and commodity companies have been
responding to expectations that those sectors will lead
(profits in) the third-quarter earnings season,"" said Paulina
Barahona, senior analyst with Cruz del Sur brokerage in
Santiago.
 Argentina's MerVal <.MERV> edged up 0.1 percent after
jumping as much as 2 percent earlier in the session. The
indicator has posted gains in the previous eight sessions.

 * Doha deal would be insurance against protectionism

(Recasts with comments from ambassadors, Lamy)
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Major trade powers sparred on
Tuesday over what needed to be done to finish the long-running
Doha round amid a flurry of recent activity to revive the
stalled talks.
 Ambassadors to the World Trade Organization from Brazil,
China, the European Union, India and the United States agreed
that much valuable work had already been done on Doha.
 But they disagreed whether a lot or a little was needed to
finish the talks, launched nine years ago this month to open
global commerce and help developing countries prosper through
more trade.
 All restated long-standing positions, indicating how hard it
will be to break out of the current impasse, but also suggesting
they were readying for a final round of bargaining.
 ""They're just positioning themselves. They're marking out
territory,"" said one senior trade official.
 The ambassadors, speaking at a WTO workshop on the
impact of the Doha round, all agreed that give and take on all
sides was needed to finish the job.
 Discussions by key WTO ambassadors in recent months to
brainstorm on Doha have brought a sense of movement to the
talks, stuck since a meeting of ministers in July 2008 broke
apart over differences over the core areas of farming and
manufacturing.
 WTO officials and negotiators hope that leaders of the G20
will reinvigorate the talks when they discuss trade over lunch
at the G20 summit in Seoul on Nov. 12.
 The main features of a Doha deal would be a cut in
distorting farm subsidies by rich countries to end trade
distortions that hurt developing nations, while emerging
economies would open up their markets for industrial goods. All
would liberalise services such as telecoms and banking, which
now account for the bulk of economic activity in most states.
 
 VARYING ESTIMATES
 Estimates of the value of a deal like that vary widely, and
the WTO workshop brought together leading trade economists to
discuss the analyses.
 Relatively modest forecasts of a boost to the global economy
of $50 billion a year from opening up farming and manufacturing
could be improved significantly with more ambitious negotiations
and liberalisation of services.
 But the main benefit from a Doha deal could be locking in
cuts in tariffs that countries have undertaken unilaterally,
preventing protectionist backsliding and providing businesses
with certainty for their investments, they found.
 In any case, EU ambassador John Clarke said EU member states
and the European Parliament would make a hard-headed political
assessment of whether a deal created opportunities in different
sectors, and created fairer conditions for developing countries,
rather than looking at macro-economic studies.
 Chinese ambassador Sun Zhenyu said China, which joined the
WTO when Doha was launched, was not pushing for any particular
concessions in the talks, but would benefit from a strengthening
of the global trading system, and warned that the round was not
primarily about opening markets for rich countries. 
 The fact that businessmen were now coming to Geneva to
discuss the talks with negotiators was a sign of hope, he said.
 ""People are talking about a possible window in 2011,"" he
said.
 U.S. ambassador Michael Punke said what had been achieved
was not insignificant -- but nor was it sufficient, reiterating
Washington's call for big emerging economies to do more to open
their markets.
 ""For us, what is very clear is the pain and what is not so
clear is the gain,"" he said, encapsulating a view voiced by most
of the others, but which WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy said
was a classical negotiating stance.
 Ultimately the fate of the Doha round will depend on what
the United States agrees with China and the other big emerging
countries, although China and the United States have not so far
got down to serious bilateral talks, diplomats said.
 Brazil had nothing to gain from the industrial goods talks,
and the proposals in farming were still disappointing for the
world's agriculture superpower, ambassador Roberto Azevedo said.
 ""In agriculture we're not convinced we're getting a lot but
we're moving in the right direction,"" he said.

 NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell on Tuesday
after Australia's surprising interest-rate hike and
somepositive economic news in the euro zone, but analysts
warned of
a possible rebound if the Federal Reserve disappoints markets
at the end of its policy meeting on Wednesday.

 Traders, however, were skeptical that the euro will be able
to sustain gains above this level, given renewed worries about
the region's sovereign debt issues.
 Analysts also noted the S&P 500 stock index's inability to
break through the 1,195-1,197 area as a sign that the euro is
losing momentum ahead of the $1.41-1.42 congestive resistance.
The euro and the S&P 500 have closely tracked each other, with
a 15-day correlation coefficient of 0.711 on Tuesday. With less
than an hour to go in Tuesday's regular U.S. stock trading

program is ""what the trade-off between dissents and QE2
commitments is.""
 No dissent, he said, even with a lower-than-expected
initial commitment to an expected second round of quantitative
easing, will likely eventually be seen as U.S. dollar negative
as it suggests ""an agreement in principle with respect to the
need for QE2 and debate over the size.""
 In contrast, Englander said two dissents at a moderate
headline quantitative easing level will be a positive for the
dollar as it would suggest that ""there is much more internal
opposition to QE2 than the market anticipated.""
 The Australian dollar hit a peak of US$1.0025, the highest
since the currency was floated in 1983. The Reserve Bank of
Australia raised its cash rate by 25 basis points to 4.75
percent as a pre-emptive strike against inflation.
 The dollar edged up 0.3 percent to 80.75 yen, though it was
still close to the record low of 79.75 yen set in 1995. The
risk of Japanese intervention to weaken the yen was expected to
increase if the dollar slips below 80 yen.

 * Rival Boeing says China to triple fleet in 20 years
 * Early talks with Dassault on business jet co-operation
 
 By Tim Hepherand Cyril Altmeyer
 PARIS, Nov 2 (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus is in
negotiations that could lead to the sale of around 100 passenger
planes to China during a Nov. 4-5 visit to France by President
Hu Jintao, sources familiar with the matter said.
The potential $10 billion deal dominates a list of contracts
sought by French-based companies in a week which could also see
preliminary contacts between China and Dassault Aviation over
co-operation in business jets, the sources said.
 EADS subsidiary Airbus declined to comment on the prospect
of an aircraft deal to mark the summit.
 ""The summit is a political event between governments. Airbus
is a corporate company,"" a spokesman said on Tuesday. ""As a
principle we never comment on negotiations with our customers.""
 Sources familiar with the matter said there have been
intense negotiations in the days leading up to the summit,
reflected in a wide range of estimates of the number of planes
involved, which would depend in turn on narrowing differences
over price.
 One source said the number of planes to be pencilled into a
final batch of economic agreements set to be announced on
Thursday ranged anywhere from zero to the ""usual range."" 
 That phrase is a reference to deals involving about 150
aircraft each struck at two previous state visits to China by
President Nicolas Sarkozy and his predecessor Jacques Chirac.
 Airbus's arch-rival Boeing grabbed a similar deal during a
visit by former President George Bush, with big-ticket orders
often described as a tool to maintain balanced relations.
 Along with most customers, China has been shy of placing
orders during the economic crisis but its state airplane buyers
are said to be back in the market on the back of a surge of
interest from plane leasing companies this year.
 
 CHINA GROWTH
 Boeing predicted on Tuesday China would triple its airplane
fleet size over the next 20 years, adding 4,330 new planes worth
$480 billion.
 The U.S. planemaker is betting that new Chinese wealth and
government spending on infrastructure will bolster travel in the
country, where the domestic passenger traffic is estimated to
grow an average of 7.9 percent annually.
 Tying plane orders into state visits is not merely a
diplomatic device but it can also make shrewd economic sense,
according to people involved in past negotiations.
 Airbus was said at late-night Beijing talks in 2007 to come
under pressure not only from Chinese negotiators but also from
French aides who wanted to secure a headline-grabbing sale.
 Analysts say it is not always clear from the protocol at
such summits whether there has been double-counting of jets or
whether all planes ordered eventually get delivered.
 If a deal on the scale envisaged is confirmed it would be
the first major purchase from China since the economic crisis,
and the first since Airbus started assembling planes for the
world's fastest-growing market at Tianjin near Beijing in 2009.
 Airbus has so far assembled 32 A320 single-aisle planes
there including 21 in 2010, a spokesman said. It now produces
two planes a month and aims to double this by the end of 2011.
 While scooping up aircraft, China is challenging both Airbus
and Boeing with plans to build its own passenger jets.
 State-backed Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China
(COMAC) is developing its own single-aisle C919 jet in an effort
to challenge the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 models from 2016.
 French companies hope Hu's visit will yield more interest in
parts for the C919 after COMAC agreed to buy French-American
engines made by Safran and General Electric.
 A Chinese delegation was also expected to visit Dassault
Aviation's Paris headquarters this week to talk about
co-operation in business jets, but there were no immediate signs
of a concrete deal, sources familiar with the matter said.
 Dassault declined to comment.

 * Finmin sees economic growth in 2011
 * Says informal Icesave talks progressing in good spirit
 
 By Mia Shanley
 REYKJAVIK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Iceland is almost ready to ease
emergency capital controls put in place after its 2008 financial
meltdown, while much-needed economic growth finally appears to
be at hand, the island's finance minister said on Tuesday.
 ""Everything points to some growth in 2011, but the question
will be how much will it be?"" Finance Minister Steingrimur
Sigfusson told Reuters. ""Is it a mild, slight recovery or a
better one?""
Sigfusson, in an interview, also said talks with creditors
Britain and the Netherlands were going well as Iceland tries to
settle a nagging dispute that has complicated its recovery
efforts.
 Iceland's economy went into a tailspin after its top three
banks collapsed under a mountain of debt in late 2008.
 Since then, the battered crown has recovered some losses,
interest rates have been chopped by more than half from a record
high 18 percent, and foreign reserves have been built up to
comfortable levels thanks to aid from the International Monetary
Fund and Nordic neighbours.
 Sigfusson said one of the final preconditions for the
further easing of capital controls -- a sound financial system
-- was within sight.
 ""We are pretty close to the end of that,"" he said. ""We are
close to having the most important preconditions in place.""
 The island's banks probably don't need fresh capital, but
they do need to restructure corporate and household debt more
quickly if the economy is to gain momentum, he said.
 ""In terms of economic growth, this is one of the most
important issues,"" he said. ""There are a lot of businesses that
are ok, that have good cash flow, but they are too indebted to
really start to move to invest or speed up production.""
 ""They have by and large been doing well through the crisis
and could speed up and invest and gear up their production as
soon as they have their balance sheets in order.""

 DEALING WITH DEBT
 Measures to help debt-laden individuals could also soon be
introduced, but he was dismissive of calls for wide-scale
write-offs of mortgage debts.
 ""I think that is more or less off the table. It is too
expensive, it is too ineffective and the arguments are not very
sound when you go into the root of the problem.""
 The country has its own massive debts to deal with. Iceland
owes Britain and the Netherlands some $5 billion for money lost
in high-interest ""Icesave"" deposit accounts.
 The minister said informal discussions with Britain and the
Netherlands had been taking place in good spirit, helped by
improving prospects for assets held by the failed banks.
 ""The returns are moving upwards, not downwards, and the
uncertainty regarding the recovery rate is going down as more
and more capital is already gathered,"" he said.
 Iceland's foreign minister said on Tuesday in Oslo that an
Icesave resolution could be reached this year. [ID:nLDE6A125G]

 * Further steps towards integration necessary
 
 By Daniel Flynn
 PARIS, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Europe's future depends on the
success of the euro, and tougher political measures are needed
to guarantee the stability of the single currency, German
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Tuesday.
 In a speech delivered at the Sorbonne University in Paris,
Schaeuble defended Franco-German efforts to draw up tougher
sanctions against countries who fail to uphold the budgetary
rules designed to underpin the euro.
 Urged by Berlin and Paris, European Union leaders last week
agreed to make limited changes to the bloc's treaty and tighten
budgetary rules, but Schaeuble reiterated the German position
that the planned measures did not go far enough.
 ""If we want a lasting, strong euro then we must be ready to
take further steps towards integration in the euro zone. If we
don't rescue the euro in the crisis, we will lose Europe and the
European idea,"" Schaeuble said in the text of a speech.
 The minister added that all 16 members of the euro area
needed to get their budget deficits back below three percent of
gross domestic product ""as quickly as possible"".
 EU leaders have set about trying to draft a permanent
mechanism for the bloc to replace a 440 billion euro ($610
billion) safety net for indebted euro zone countries due to
expire in mid-2013.
 For this to work, it would have to be possible to impose
political and financial sanctions including the suspension of
voting rights, Schaeuble said. Other EU member states have
rejected the idea of allowing voting rights to be frozen.
 ""A key element of the mechanism must be the inclusion of the
private sector,"" he said, noting that public bailouts had so far
protected private investors from the risk of defaults.
 ""I'd like to remind those who still have a problem with this
kind of mechanism that the currency union was never intended as
a model for allowing financial speculators to get rich.
 ""And it's not a system to redistribute (wealth) from so
called rich countries to poorer ones in the framework of a
transfer union either,"" Schaeuble added.
 Last week's agreement among EU leaders in Brussels followed
an earlier deal between Paris and Berlin which some smaller
states saw as a stitch-up by the EU's biggest member states.
 The Franco-German partnership was crucial for the future of
the union, the 68-year-old minister said.
 ""Only when Germany and France act together and apply the
rules we impose on ourselves in an exemplary fashion will we
ultimately manage to convince all member states of embarking on
a collective road towards a future Europe,"" he said.
 Schaeuble, one of the architects of German reunification,
also dismissed the suggestion that Germany had agreed to give up
the mark for the euro to get the backing of other nations for
the postwar division of the country to end in 1990.
 ""Economic and monetary union was never a quid pro quo for
German reunification. It was and is a conscious, logical step
towards deeper European integration, which is in the interests
of all the member states concerned,"" he said.

 NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Oil rose on Tuesday as the
dollar slipped ahead of an expected decision by the Federal
Reserve to inject more money into the economy, and as more
members of OPEC signaled a tolerance for higher prices.
 The U.S. central bank is expected to announce a second
round of quantitative easing totaling around $500 billion of
government debt purchases over several months at the end of its
two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.
 U.S. crude for December delivery  rose $1.20 to
$84.15 at 1:20 p.m. EDT (1720 GMT), putting it within sight of
its highest closing price since May.
 ICE December Brent crude  rose $1.08 to $85.70.
 The dollar weakened broadly and Wall Street rallied, both
factors that have helped propel oil and commodity prices higher
this year, as investors awaited the expected Federal Reserve
attempts to support a faltering recovery and the results of
Tuesday's U.S. mid-term elections.
 ""The dollar is being sold and equities are higher, lifting
oil, but there is some caution ahead of the elections and the
Fed announcement,"" said Chris Dillman, analyst at Tradition
Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
 Crude spiked in reaction to the top official for OPEC
member Libya telling Reuters he thought oil prices would get
closer to $100 by year's end. [ID:nWLA6884]
 Shokri Ghanem, chairman of Libya's National Oil Corp, said
producers' income for dollar-denominated oil had declined while
the cost of food and other commodities had risen due to the
slump in the dollar, which has declined 1.5 percent against a
basket of currencies this year but plunged about 8 percent
since September.
 The Libyan comments came a day after Saudi Oil Minister Ali
al-Naimi said oil prices in a $70-$90 range were comfortable
for consumers, signaling a higher acceptable range from the
$70-$80 range the kingdom has previously said was comfortable.
[ID:nLDE6A10FW]
 Qatar's oil minister also said $70-$90 per barrel would be
reasonable for consumers and producers. [ID:nSGE6A102C]
 The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, the
Australian dollar jumped to a 28-year high against the
greenback and the euro traded above $1.40, buoyed by a pick up
in euro zone manufacturers' output. [USD/]
 The weak dollar lifts oil and other dollar-denominated
commodities as it lowers the value of currency paid to oil
producers and can attract investment seeking better returns
than found in other markets.
 SELL THE NEWS
 Several traders and analysts voiced caution ahead of the
Federal Reserve's move, with some expecting a ""sell the news""
reaction in oil markets if the Fed's actions are not as
substantive as expected.

 By Walker Simon
 NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - World stocks neared a 2-year
high on Tuesday after stronger-than-expected economic data
while the dollar fell as investors anticipated the U.S. central
bank will open the money spigot to spur the flagging U.S.
economy.
 U.S. stocks also got a boost from investors' expectations
of strong Republican gains in Congress halfway through the term
of Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama. Shares in sectors
such as healthcare, deemed likely to benefit from the
rebalancing of power, advanced.
 In campaigns, Republicans accused Democrats of stifling
business with regulations and failing to extend tax cuts, while
Democrats countered with claims that Republicans blocked
economic recovery programs.
 ""I think it is people trying to get in front of what they
think will be the election results,"" said Rick Meckler,
president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in
New York, in reference to expectations of Republicans' gains.
 The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies, with
the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> down 0.78 percent. A drop in the
greenback makes dollar-denominated commodities, including oil,
cheaper for non-U.S. investors. U.S. crude oil futures gained
1.2 percent to nearly $84 a barrel.
 European equities hit a six-month closing high on Tuesday,
lifted by energy companies after the price of oil rose.
 Euro-zone manufacturing picked up its pace last month, a
business survey showed Tuesday, one day after
better-than-expected U.S. and Chinese factory data increased
optimism about the global economy and revived risk appetite.
For details, see [ID:nLDE6A10TX]
 ""From a global perspective, the growth outlook looks solid
and that's feeding some appetite for risk,"" Omer Esiner, chief
market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington,
said.
 The euro traded above $1.40, buoyed by the European
economic data. But traders doubted the euro would be able to
stay above this level, with uncertainty over the extent of the
Fed's asset purchases. The Fed announcement is expected on
Wednesday at the end of a two-day policy meeting.
 Markets have priced in Fed asset buying of $100 billion a
month for five months in an attempt to bring long-term interest
rates evem lower and stimulate a sluggish U.S. economy.
 SIZE MATTERS
 The program's size is key. A larger-than-expected program
of asset buying, which has been described as printing money,
would weigh on the dollar and boost commodity prices, while a
smaller round of purchases could curb investors' appetite for
risk.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.87
percent to 319.54, a whisker shy of the two year-high of 319.84
hit on Oct. 25.
The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
rose 0.6 percent to end the day provisionally at 1,093.96
points, its highest close since late April.
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average<.DJI>
advanced 77.61 points, or 0.70 percent, to 11,202.23. The
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose 9.53 points, or 0.80
percent, to 1,193.91. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC>
climbed 24.65 points, or 0.98 percent, to 2,529.49.
 Most gains came from sectors expected to benefit from a
rebalancing of power in the U.S. Congress. Among those expected
to thrive if Republicans regain control of Congress are the
health insurers, a sector hurt by the Democrats' push to reform
healthcare. Republicans have vowed to repeal the healthcare
reform law.
 On Monday, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found Republicans are
poised to take control of the House, gaining at least 50 seats,
but they are unlikely to win a majority in the Senate.
 In foreign currency trade, the euro  rose 1.07
percent to $1.4037 from a previous session close of $1.3889.
 Against the Japanese yen, though, the dollar  was up
0.34 percent at 80.75 from a previous session close of 80.480.
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  rose $1.01, or 1.22
percent, to $83.96 per barrel, gaining after OPEC member Libya
said oil producers would find prices of $100 a barrel more
comfortable, due to higher food prices and a weaker dollar.
 Spot gold  benefited from the dollar's decline
against a basket of major currencies, with the price of gold
rising to $1,354.36 an ounce from $1,351.51 late on Monday.
 Prices of U.S. Treasuries climbed on talk about the size
of the Fed's expected bond-buying program. The benchmark
10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up 7/32, with the
yield at 2.603 percent.
 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was up 31/32, or
almost a full point, with the yield at 3.946 percent.
 In Asian trading hours, Japan's broad-based Topix index
fell to its lowest in 19 months on Tuesday as the yen's
strength against the dollar earlier in the day hurt exporters'
shares. The Topix <.TOPX> dipped 0.02 percent to end at 803.12,
a 19-month low, while the benchmark Nikkei <.N225> inched up
0.06 percent to end at 9,159.98, off a seven-week low.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell on Tuesday
after a surprise interest rate hike from Australia and positive
euro zone economic news but analysts warned of a possible
rebound if the Federal Reserve disappoints markets at the end
of its policy meeting on Wednesday.
 Investors also awaited the results of U.S. midterm
elections on Tuesday and some analysts said a Republican win
could be positive for the U.S. currency on hopes for more
fiscal austerity and reduced government regulation.
 But most investors have looked past elections and instead
focused on a two-day meeting by the Federal Open Market
Committee, which looks set to announce a second round of
monetary easing on Wednesday.
 Markets widely expect the Fed to commit to buying at least
$500 billion in Treasury debt in the coming months. Much
uncertainty surrounds the scope and pace of purchases, however,
as well as the level of commitment by policymakers.
 ""It's not just a question of the size of asset purchases,
but also the commitment they (the Fed) have to purchases. If
the level of commitment is more conditional than what the
market expected, that would disappoint markets,"" said Aroop
Chatterjee, currency strategist at Barclays Capital in New
York.
 ""U.S. data has been quite strong of late. Our economists
think the Fed will take a more incremental approach and will
make QE conditional on economic data,"" he added, referring to
quantitative easing under which the Fed floods the economy with
cheap money in a bid to spur a stubbornly sluggish recovery.
 Analysts said the risk of a dollar recovery is building
since the currency has sold off 8 percent against a basket of
currencies since September on expectations of the Fed printing
more money via large purchases of U.S. government debt.
 Short speculative dollar positions have stayed above $20
billion in recent weeks.
 David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at money
management firm Gluskin Sheff in Toronto, expects the dollar to
strengthen after the Fed announcement. ""Its hugely oversold,""
he said.
 In midday trading, the dollar index, which tracks the
greenback against a basket of six currencies, was down 0.8
percent at 76.687.
 The euro traded as high as $1.4052 on EBS, buoyed by a
pick-up in euro zone manufacturers' output.
 Traders, however, were skeptical that the euro will be able
to sustain gains above this level given renewed worries about
the region's sovereign debt issues.
 Ashraf Laidi, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in
London, said the S&P 500 stock index's inability to break
through the 1,195 level suggests euro/dollar will be unlikely
break out of its $1.41-1.42 congestive resistance.
 ""The intermarket dynamics (are) increasingly set up for a
stabilizing greenback and reluctant equities,"" he said.
 DISSENTS A FACTOR
 Citigroup's head of G10 FX strategy Steven Englander wrote
in a note that another uncertainty that could come from the Fed
statement is ""what the trade-off between dissents and QE2
commitments is.""
 No dissent, he said, even with a lower than expected
initial commitment to an expected second round of quantitative
easing, will likely eventually be seen as U.S. dollar negative
as it suggests ""an agreement in principle with respect to the
need for QE2 and debate over the size.""
 By contrast, Englander said two dissents at a moderate
headline quantitative easing level will be a positive for the
dollar as it would suggest that ""there is much more internal
opposition to QE2 than the market anticipated.""highest since
the currency was floated in 1983. The Reserve Bank of Australia
raised its cash rate by 25 basis points to 4.75 percent as a
preemptive strike against inflation. That highlighted the
contrast with the Fed which is widely seen as easing policy
further to help revitalize the U.S. economy and extended the
differential between the two economies' two-year yields to
their widest since early 2008.
 The dollar edged up 0.3 percent to 80.75 yen, though it was
still close to the record low of 79.75 yen set in 1995. The
risk of Japanese intervention to weaken the yen was expected to
mount if the dollar slips below 80 yen.

 On Monday, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found Republicans are
poised to take control of the House, gaining at least 50 seats,
but they are unlikely to win a majority in the Senate.

 By Krisztina Than
 BUDAPEST, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Hungary has turned its back on
austerity and is gambling on economic growth to get its finances
back in order, but analysts say its policies could backfire in a
couple of years.
 While governments across Europe have slashed spending to
reduce budget shortfalls, Hungary's centre-right Fidesz
government plans to divert assets in private pension funds back
into state coffers to meet its deficit target next year.
 It has also imposed big temporary windfall taxes on its
banking, retail, energy and telecoms sectors.
 After these taxes expire in 2012, Hungary -- which only two
years ago needed a massive IMF/EU rescue package to save it from
financial meltdown -- is pinning everything on rising exports
and tax cuts to fuel rapid economic growth from 2013.
 But analysts say that while its plans, which the IMF has
dubbed ""bold but risky"", may help massage its deficit down in
2011, they could also lead to long-term sustainability risks.
 ""From the longer term perspective, the government is just
rescheduling the repayment of its debt, and this operation
resembles liability management, not debt reduction,"" Goldman
Sachs said in a note on the budget plans.
 Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who came to fame in 1989 when
he urged Hungarians to elect a government that would send
occupying Russian troops home, has never shied away from bold
moves.
 With a two-thirds majority in parliament, his Fidesz party
can rewrite any law it wants, and last week it proposed
legislation to strip the nation's top court of the right to
review bills on budget issues. That would remove the last
obstacle to Fidesz' plans for boosting growth.
 The government also plans to rechannel billions of dollars
from private pension funds to state coffers next year, plugging
a hole in the state pension fund and giving it room to cut
income taxes sharply -- but also creating serious future fiscal
sustainability risks.
 ""These flows do not improve the net worth of the government
sector, as the new inflows of pension contributions are
accompanied by a new inflow of liabilities to future
pensioners,"" CSFB analysts said in a note.
 They added that without the changes to the pension system,
Hungary's deficit would deteriorate in 2011 compared with 2010.
 Hungary has one of the highest debt to GDP ratios in central
Europe at slightly above 80 percent.
 Its pension fund asset-grab follows the EU's refusal earlier
this year to let the country loosen its deficit targets or take
into account the cost of pension reform when calculating its
deficit and debt numbers.
 That would have given Fidesz room to implement tax cuts, a
key plank of its campaign before it took power in April.
 The pension move, which pension funds have said amounts to
nationalisation, combined with short-term windfall taxes will
ensure that the deficit falls to 2.94 percent of GDP next year
-- below the 3 percent required by the EU -- from 3.8 percent
this year.
 The assets taken over from private pension funds in
particular will help reduce the deficit next year and will also
cut its debt by several percentage points of GDP.
 ""Assuming, as the government does, that 90 percent of
participants leave (private pension funds), this could result in
7.4 percent of GDP available for debt reduction,"" Goldman Sachs
said in its note.
 Rating agencies Moody's and S&P -- which said in July that
they might downgrade Hungary's sovereign rating if the
government does not present credible fiscal plans -- have yet to
give their views on the 2011 budget and recent measures.
 
 GROWTH HOPES
 Uncertainties will grow beyond 2012, when Hungary's
financing needs rise due to redemptions and the repayment of the
emergency loans it secured from international lenders in 2008.
 Gillian Edgeworth at Unicredit said that the impact of the
pension plans was negative for bonds in the mid-term, partly due
to lower domestic demand from pension funds, while Hungary's
long-term financing risks have increased.
""Although the measures will undoubtedly improve the near-term
deficit outlook and effectively ensure that the 2010 and 2011
deficit targets are met... there are significant long-term risks
as the government has so far failed to present meaningful
reductions on the expenditure side,"" Edgeworth said.
 ""In order to compensate for this the government will need to
adjust its expenditures and/or hope for a significant
acceleration of GDP growth. Local estimates put this required
growth rate in the range of 5-6 percent.""
 The Economy Ministry projects that GDP growth could pick up
to 5 percent by 2013, and 5.2 percent in 2014.
 That could be tough to achieve, however. Hungary's economy
is expected to grow about 1 percent this year and analysts
project 2.6 percent growth for next year.
 While the windfall taxes on banks and some companies are
seen as a short-term negative for investor sentiment and growth,
the impact of income tax cuts and tax breaks for families on
household consumption is hard to estimate.
 The government's plans also hinge on a rapid rise in exports
to western Europe, mainly Germany, and do not allow for any
break in the global recovery.
 ""Without specific moves to reduce the structural deficit,
government plans for fiscal consolidation are ultimately
unlikely to result in a lasting reduction in the risk premia and
long-term rates,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Magdalena Polan said.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar raced to
a 28-year high against the greenback on Tuesday after a
surprise Australian interest rate hike, while the U.S. currency
fell ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting expected to produce a
fresh round of monetary easing.
 The euro traded above $1.40, buoyed by a pick-up in the
euro zone manufacturers' output. For more see [ID:nLDE6A10TX].
 Traders, however, were skeptical that the euro will be able
to sustain gains above this level given uncertainty surrounding
the Fed's decision on Wednesday and the renewed escalation in
sovereign debt worries.
 The Reserve Bank of Australia, meanwhile, raised its cash
rate by 25 basis points to 4.75 percent as a preemptive strike
against inflation. That highlighted the contrast with the Fed
which is widely seen as easing policy further on Wednesday to
help revitalize the U.S. economy and extended the differential
between the two economies' two-year yields to their widest
since early 2008. Benchmark U.S. rates are close to zero.
 Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange, said Australia's rate hike along with
better-than-expected economic data out of the United States,
Britain, and China the last few days have increased optimism
about the global economy and revived risk appetite,
 ""We're seeing elevated stocks, commodities, and stronger
performance of higher-yielding assets. From a global
perspective, the growth outlook looks solid and that's feeding
some appetite for risk,"" Washington-based Esiner said.
 In mid-morning trading, the dollar index <.DXY> was down
0.8 percent at 76.669 against a currency basket. The Australian
dollar traded 1.3 percent higher on the day at US$1.0011, with
near-term gains seen limited by stop-loss orders around
$1.0015. It hit a peak of US$1.0025 , the highest since
the currency was floated in 1983.
 FOCUS REMAINS ON FOMC
 The euro  gained 1.1 percent to $1.4041, with talk
of demand of a semi-official European name helping boost the
European single currency.
 Aside from the RBA rate hike, the flavor of the day remains
the Federal Open Market Committee, which starts its two-day
meeting on Tuesday and looked close to embarking on a second
round of monetary easing. [ID:nN01141530]
 Markets generally expect the Fed to commit to buying at
least $500 billion in Treasury debt in the coming months. Much
uncertainty surrounds the scope and pace of purchases, however,
leaving the dollar vulnerable to choppy moves in prevailing
ranges.
 Robert Lynch, senior currency strategist at HSBC in New
York, suggested that if the Fed meets the market's
expectations, the negative impact on the dollar may not be all
that dramatic as the currency's decline since the summer seemed
to price in much of that outcome.
 He added that the ""anticipation of the Fed outcome in the
run-up to Wednesday's announcement is more likely to work
against, rather than for, the dollar.""
 Investors were also keeping an eye on the results of U.S.
mid-term elections being held on Tuesday. Polls continue to
indicate Republicans will take over the House of
Representatives, close the gap on Democrats' lead in the Senate
and take over a majority of the country's governorships.
 Some analysts have said this could be positive for the
dollar since the Republicans were running on a campaign of
fiscal austerity and reduced government regulation.
 HSBC's Lynch, however, said that is a ""gross
oversimplification of what could actually happen.""
 But he pointed out that in an ""environment where there is
already a good amount of bad news priced into the dollar, we
would not dismiss the potential for those sentiments to work to
the currency's advantage in the coming days, providing it is
not countered by the Fed and upcoming U.S. economic data.""

 The dollar edged up 0.2 percent to 80.66 yen , though

The risk of Japanese intervention to weaken the yen was
expected to mount if the dollar slips below 80 yen.

 * Base pay will rise, will be harder to hire in U.S., Asia
 * Could also impact cross-border M&A
 By Steve Slater
 LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Europe's banks face a frantic last
few weeks of the year to determine bonus payouts radically
changed by tough new rules, which they say may hurt their
ability to recruit overseas and win cross-border takeovers.
 European regulators last month unveiled far-reaching curbs
on bonuses, which go far beyond new global guidelines and aim to
align pay with risks and curb bankers chasing short-term
rewards. But a one-month consultation period means the rules
will not be finalised until Dec. 9-10.
 ""The timing of the final rules is causing a genuine headache
as it's all running up to the end of the year,"" said Alistair
Woodland, a partner at law firm Clifford Chance in London.
 The rules take effect from the start of January, and cover
bonuses for 2010 performance for thousands of senior bankers.
 Woodland saw limited scope for banks to avoid the new rules,
as specific rules are backed up by broader guidelines.
 ""The EU has come out with a prescriptive set of rules that
have to be applied. That goes a long way beyond what anyone else
is doing,"" he said at a briefing on Tuesday. 
 ""It's difficult to think of ways in which you can avoid
them. If you found your way around one of the little rules you
may be in breach of the principles.""
 Bankers have said knock-on effects from the new rules are
already being seen and more will occur.
 Already base pay is rising as banks see the need to reward
star rainmakers with more in fixed pay to compensate for lower,
deferred bonuses.
 The rules will be applied to all the global operations of a
European-domiciled bank, thus making it more difficult for
European lenders to hire and retain bankers in Asia and the
United States compared with more free-wheeling rivals.
 In a takeover battle an EU firm could also be disadvantaged
if its target is concerned about being subjected to the new
rules, Clifford Chance said.
 Other risks include a lack of consistency across all EU
countries and limited resources for regulators to police them.
 Banks and lobby groups have said the rules need to be
applied consistently. 
 Under the rules bonuses will be capped on the basis of
earnings and liable for repayment if shown to have been awarded
for risky actions.
 Only a portion of a bonus will be payable upfront, with 40
to 60 percent deferred over 3-5 years, depending on the risk
profile of the staff member, and half of the bonus must be in
shares or other securities. 
 As a result, if 60 percent of a bonus is deferred and half
is paid in shares, the banker will only receive 20 percent of
the overall bonus in cash immediately.
 The guidelines are tougher than a remuneration code being
applied in Britain, the EU's biggest banking centre, and also
wider, with an expected 2,500 UK financial firms seen affected.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - World stocks rose towards last
week's two-year high on Tuesday while the dollar fell broadly as
expected monetary easing from the Federal Reserve and a recent
upturn in global economic data underpinned risk appetite.
 The Australian dollar hit its highest level against the
dollar since 1983 after Australia surprised with an interest
rate hike just before the Fed began a two-day meeting.
 The U.S. central bank is expected to announce a large-scale
asset purchases on Wednesday to spur economic recovery, with
dealers expecting asset buying of up to $100 billion per month
under a quantitative easing programme.
 The size of the programme is key as a bigger than expected
asset buying -- or money printing -- will weigh on the dollar
and boost commodity prices, while smaller buying would hit
investor risk appetite.
 ""The main story is what the Fed will do tomorrow and what it
will do to the dollar,"" Commerzbank commodities analyst Carsten
Fritsch said.
 ""The risk is that the markets are disappointed in the scale
of QE2, that it is less than some people are expecting.""
 The MSCI world equity index rose a quarter of one percent,
and the Thomson Reuters global stock index gained 0.9 percent.
 Positive economic data on Monday also underpinned investor
morale. U.S. factory activity in October expanded and
construction spending rose unexpectedly in September while
manufacturing in China expanded at the fastest pace in six
months in October.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.4 percent while emerging
stocks rose 0.2 percent.
 U.S. crude oil gained 0.5 percent to $83.33 a barrel.
 Bund futures rose 64 ticks. The spread investors pay to hold
the Irish 10-year government bonds rather than German benchmarks
hit a new high around 486 basis points as investors remained
concerned about peripheral euro zone debt.
 The dollar fell 0.3 percent against a basket of major
currencies.
 Earlier, the Reserve Bank of Australia raised its cash rate
by 25 basis points to 4.75 percent as a pre-emptive strike
against inflation, sending the Aussie above parity to $1.0013,
its highest since the currency was floated in 1983.
 ""We're entering uncharted territory, but the Aussie has
staying power up here,"" said Carl Hammer, chief currency
strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 ""We see it trade above parity in the mid term, as there's
also the issue of general dollar selling.""
 Investors are reluctant to take huge positions, with
Tuesday's U.S. mid-term elections also a factor. A Reuters/Ipsos
poll found on Monday Republicans will take control of the U.S.
House of Representatives from President Barack Obama's
Democrats.
 Republicans are poised to gain at least 50 seats in the
House and take control of the chamber but are unlikely to take
the Senate, polls indicate.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar hit a
28-year high against the greenback on Tuesday after a surprise
Australian interest rate hike, while the U.S. currency stayed
weak on expectations of fresh monetary easing.
 The Reserve Bank of Australia raised its cash rate by 25
basis points to 4.75 percent as a pre-emptive strike against
inflation, sending the Aussie above parity to $1.0013. It was
the second time the currency has scaled parity since it was
floated in 1983.
 The RBA's move increased the interest rate differential
between Australia, where rates are rising, and the United
States, where the Federal Reserve is widely seen as easing
policy further on Wednesday to help stimulate the economy.
 Analysts said this view would support the Australian
currency while providing one more reason to sell the dollar,
which has already suffered on speculation that more Fed easing
will further weaken the currency.
 ""We're entering uncharted territory, but the Aussie has
staying power up here,"" said Carl Hammer, chief currency
strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 ""We see it trade above parity in the mid term, as there's
also the issue of general dollar selling.""
 Investors also anticipated results of U.S. midterm
elections, with analysts saying the dollar may initially gain
slightly on relief after clearing a hurdle in a week piled high
with event risk.
 The dollar index was down 0.34 percent at 77.03 against a
currency basket. The Australian dollar traded 1.1 percent higher
on the day at $0.9980 with near-term gains seen limited by
stop-loss orders around $1.0015.
 The euro gained 0.5 percent to $1.3959, with talk of demand
of a semi-official European name helping boost the single
European currency. The single currency was also helped by strong
German PMI numbers..
 Jeremy Stretch, head of currency strategy at CIBC World
Markets said the strong German PMI data and uncertainty before
the U.S. elections and the Fed meeting could push the euro back
above $1.40.
 The Federal Open Market Committee starts its two-day meet on
Tuesday and looked close to embarking on a second round of
monetary easing..
 
 MID TERM ELECTION AND FED
 The euro was expected to run into resistance at $1.40,
traders said. With the euro's triangle holding pattern since
mid-October in place, the lower end of the triangle around
$1.3750-70 was seen as a support and a good entry point for
those betting on a break above the triangle after the Fed
meeting.
 Markets are generally priced for the Fed to commit to buying
at least $500 billion in Treasury debt over the coming months.
 Much uncertainty surrounds the scope and pace of bond
purchases, however, leaving the dollar vulnerable to choppy
moves in prevailing ranges.
 ""If the Fed's purchase is smaller than $500 billion, there
will be more dollar buying in the near term, though I suspect
the dollar will remain under pressure on expectations that the
Fed will eventually expand its asset purchases,"" a trader at a
U.S. bank said.
 The dollar edged up 0.3 percent to 80.74 yen, though
still close to the record low of 79.75 yen set in 1995. The risk
of Japanese intervention to weaken the yen was expected to mount
if the dollar slips below 80 yen.

 * Tariffs already lower, unlikely to be reduced much further
 * Membership should boost predictability, attract investors
 
 By Toni Vorobyova
 MOSCOW, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Russian entry into the World Trade
Organisation, expected as soon as 2011, should boost its appeal
to investors but is unlikely to lead to big new cuts in tariffs,
the World Bank's Lead Economist for Russia told Reuters.
 Russia has been seeking WTO membership since 1993 and its
accession process has gained momentum after a June summit in
Washington.
 ""That is the expectation right now (that Russia will join
next year) and it seems to be not unrealistic,"" Zeljko Bogetic
said in an interview.
 ""There is obviously renewed political momentum ... But we
... would want a few more steps before we could declare
victory.""
 With gross domestic product of $1.2 trillion, Russia is by
far the largest economy outside the 153-member WTO. Its
membership talks are due to resume at the start of December.
 Moscow is no stranger to stimulating the economy with
subsidies -- such as in the agricultural sector -- or with
preferential taxes for domestically produced goods like cars.
 But Bogetic cautioned against expecting a big reduction in
tariffs as a result of WTO membership.
 ""The tariff levels in Russia have already been adjusted from
the old levels significantly, even considering the crisis. So
any gains will be limited in that sense, in my view,"" he said.
 
 PREDICTABILITY
 The main benefits -- both for Russia and for the world --
will come from greater predictability, which should aid plans by
President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to
attract more foreign investment into the country.
 Russia -- which banned grain exports earlier this year --
would have to act under WTO rules once a member, reducing the
scope for one-sided, unexpected measures on trade.
 ""The gains will be more in locking in the institutional
environment and the whole trading system that Russia will have,""
Bogetic said.
 That ""will enhance the predictability of foreign trade for
domestic and foreign investors and, by doing so, make Russia
more attractive and more predictable for doing business.""
 Russia is seeking to reduce its economic dependence on
natural resources and says WTO membership will improve access to
global markets for its goods.
 The World Bank has estimated WTO entry could increase the
size of the Russian economy by as much as 3.3 percent in the
medium term and 11 percent in the long term.
 It has also said it expects Russian import tariffs would
fall from 14 percent on average to 8 percent after entry.
 Russia's bid to join the WTO is the longest-running in
history, with issues over duties and tariffs on goods from meat
to timber, and at-times hostile relations with Europe and the
United States having hampered past negotiations.
 The White House said on Monday the United States had
resolved its issues with Moscow on Russia's entry, however, and
would work with international partners to move the membership
process forward.

918,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2010 05:56AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Euro zone factories pick up pace in October," * Euro zone manufacturing growth rebounds in October
 * Factory jobs growth hits highest since March 2008
 * German strength again offsets weaker bloc members

(Adds details, comment)
 By Andy Bruce
 LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Euro zone manufacturers boosted
their output in October at a faster pace than previously
estimated, a business survey showed on Tuesday, with Spain and
Ireland both recovering while Greece continued to struggle.
 The Markit Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index
(PMI) rose to 54.6 in October, revised up from the earlier
estimate of 54.1 and comfortably higher than the final reading
of 53.7 for September.
 The survey showed factories across the currency area hired
staff at the quickest rate since March 2008 last month. But
worryingly for policymakers, there was still a growing
divergence among member states' recovery rates.
 Germany once again led the upturn, with growth accelerating,
and while Spain saw a return to positive territory France's
factory upswing moderated as output slowed to a 14-month low.
 Greek manufacturing stayed firmly in the grip of recession,
with the pace of contraction accelerating as output, jobs and
new orders fell but Ireland saw a modest return to growth.
 Financial markets were little moved by the numbers.
 ""It is welcome news to see euro zone manufacturing picking
up in October and the sector looks like it can make a decent
contribution to GDP growth in the fourth quarter,"" said Howard
Archer at IHS Global Insight.
 ""The concern is that going forward it will be held back by
inventory corrections drawing to a close in some countries,
slower global growth and domestic demand being limited in most
euro zone countries by tighter fiscal policy increasingly
kicking in.""
 
 SLOWING
 While still firmly above the 50 mark that divides growth
from contraction, the headline reading is still some way off
April's post-recession high of 57.6. 
 Manufacturers reported improved output last month and they
took on staff at the fastest rate in around 2-1/2 years, the
survey of about 2,000 companies showed. 
 But euro zone unemployment is still running at more than 10
percent and any optimism over manufacturing may also be tempered
by surveys on the services sector on Thursday, expected to
confirm a picture of slowing growth.
 A Reuters poll of economists published last month showed the
16-nation euro zone economy growing 1.6 percent in 2010, before
slowing to 1.4 percent next year as countries step up budget
austerity measures.
 The uneven economic recovery will force the European Central
Bank to keep interest rates on hold at their record low of 1.0
percent until fourth quarter of next year, a Reuters poll last
week predicted.
 The manufacturing output sub-index saw a strong upward
revision to 54.7 from the flash reading of 53.8, up from
September's final number of 54.0. The jobs sub-index rose to
52.2 from 51.5 in September.

 (Adds comment, updates throughout)
 
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar hit its
highest against the dollar since 1983 on Tuesday after a
surprise Australian interest rate hike, while the U.S. currency
stayed weak on expectations of fresh monetary easing.
 The Reserve Bank of Australia raised its cash rate by 25
basis points to 4.75 percent as a pre-emptive strike against
inflation, sending the Aussie above parity to $1.0013, its
highest since the currency was floated in 1983.
 The RBA's move increased the interest rate differential
between Australia, where rates are rising, and the United
States, where the Federal Reserve is widely seen as easing
policy further on Wednesday to help stimulate the economy.
 Analysts said this view would support the Australian
currency while providing one more reason to dump the dollar,
which already has suffered on speculation that more Fed easing
will further weaken the currency.
 ""We're entering uncharted territory, but the Aussie has
staying power up here,"" said Carl Hammer, chief currency
strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 ""We see it trade above parity in the mid term, as there's
also the issue of general dollar selling.""
 Investors also anticipated results of U.S. midterm
elections, with analysts saying the dollar may initially gain
slightly on relief after clearing a hurdle in a week piled high
with event risk.
 By 0855 GMT, the Australian dollar traded 1.4 percent higher
on the day at $1.0001. Near-term gains were seen limited by
stop-loss orders seen around $1.0015.
 The euro rose 0.4 percent to the day's high of $1.3966, with
talk of demand of a semi-official European name helping boost
the single European currency.
 The U.S. currency fell roughly half a percent to 76.957
versus a currency basket.
 The euro crept closer to $1.40, a level which has provided
key resistance in past weeks.
 While the market remains extremely short of dollars,
participants believe those positions have been pared back in the
lead-up to the midterm elections, whose results start to come in
later on Tuesday, and the Fed's policy decision the next day.
 Markets are generally priced for the Fed to commit to buying
at least $500 billion in Treasury debt over the coming months.
 Much uncertainty surrounds the scope and pace of bond
purchases, however, leaving the dollar vulnerable to choppy
moves in prevailing ranges.
 ""If the Fed's purchase is smaller than $500 billion, there
will be more dollar buying in the near term, though I suspect
the dollar will remain under pressure on expectations that the
Fed will eventually expand its asset purchases,"" a trader at a
U.S. bank said.
 With the euro's triangle holding pattern since
mid-October firmly in place, the lower end of the triangle
around $1.3750-70 is seen as a support and a good entry point
for those betting on a break above the triangle after the Fed
meeting.
 The dollar edged up 0.1 percent to 80.56 yen, though still
in sight of the record low of 79.75 yen set in 1995. The risk of
Japanese intervention to weaken the yen expected to mount if the
dollar slips below 80 yen.

 * New orders grow, factory output slows
 * Employment stabilises after 29-month contraction
 
 PARIS, Nov 2 (Reuters) - France's factory upturn moderated
in October as output slowed to a 14-month low, but robust new
order growth and a stabilisation in jobs suggested the sector's
recovery was broadly on track, a survey showed on Tuesday.
 The Markit/CDAF final purchasing manager's index (PMI) for
the factory sector fell to 55.2 in October from 56.0 in
September, in line with an earlier flash estimate.
 The output index dipped to its lowest level since August
2009 at 55.2, versus 58.0 in September, as manufacturers
liquidated their inventories at the fastest rate in eight
months.
 But rosier data on unemployment and new orders offset the
slowdown in factory output, Markit said.
 The index of manufacturing jobs rose to 50.0, marking the
stabilisation of headcount levels after 29 consecutive months of
contraction, while new orders rose to their highest level since
April..
 ""PMI data signal a further robust expansion of the French
manufacturing sector in October,"" Jack Kennedy, an economist at
Markit, said in a statement.
 While the manufacturing sector's recovery lost steam in
October, a boost in new orders from domestic and foreign buyers
hinted the slowdown was only a blip as French firms switch to
more efficient production techniques, he said.
 ""Furthermore, a stabilisation of employment... suggests that
firms are becoming more confident in the sustainability of the
upturn,"" Kennedy added.
 With trading partners in Europe, Asia and the United States
in better shape, a larger portion of new orders came from
abroad, Markit said. Export orders accelerated to a four-month
high, extending an expansion period to 16 months.
 Data published this week showed French consumers regaining
confidence in September, as spending on manufactured goods rose
1.5 percent compared to August, fuelled by a jump in car
purchases.
 Consumer confidence also rose last month, driven partly by a
slight improvement in the labour market. Though job creation was
sluggish in September, French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde
said the recovery picture was intact.
 Overall, October's PMI data offered upbeat signals for the
French manufacturing sector, with the promise of increased
demand and an improving view for jobs.

 TOKYO, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar leapt after
Australia's central bank surprised markets with a rate hike on
Tuesday, leading the U.S. dollar to give back gains in ranges
that tightened ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting.
 The Reserve Bank of Australia raised its cash rate by a
quarter of a percentage point to 4.75 percent as a pre-emptive
strike against inflation, sending the Aussie dollar up 1 percent
on the day to re-test parity with the U.S. dollar.
 The Aussie is expected to struggle around $1.0004, a peak in
October which was its highest since its 1983 float. With
uncertainty before Wednesday's Fed decision, it might not make
much headway near term, but analysts expect the RBA to increase
rates again next year, keeping the Aussie buoyant.
 ""Ahead of the (Fed) decision we're going to see some
reduction in risk and if you were to pick out crowded positions
in the market, the Aussie and Treasuries are probably the two big
ones,"" said Robert Ryan, FX strategist at BNP Paribas in
Singapore.
 ""So there may be a bit of a pullback in Aussie between now
and the Fed, but probably a resumption of the move upwards after
that.""
 The Australian dollar rose 1.1 percent on the day to $0.9980,
charging up as far as $0.9993 at one point, and it gained 1.2
percent to 80.37 yen.
 The Fed is widely expected to announce a second round of
monetary easing on Wednesday, with markets generally priced for
the central bank to commit to buying at least $500 billion in
Treasury debt over the coming months to spur a flagging economy.
 Much uncertainty surrounds the scope and pace of bond
purchases, however, leaving the dollar vulnerable to choppy moves
in prevailing ranges.
 ""If the Fed's purchase is smaller than $500 billion, there
will be more dollar buying in the near term, though I suspect the
dollar will remain under pressure on expectations that the Fed
will eventually expand its asset purchases,"" said a trader at a
U.S. bank.
 The dollar edged up 0.1 percent to 80.56 yen, though still in
sight of the record low of 79.75 yen set in 1995.
 ""The market is turning cautious ahead of the Fed's meeting.
As the market position has been overwhelmingly short in the
dollar, the psychology at work here is that you should unwind
your position,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 Japanese investors and importers are also said to be bidding
the dollar, viewing its current level near a record low as
suitable for bargain-hunting.
 Markets kept a wary eye on the currency pair, with the risk
of Japanese intervention to weaken the yen expected to mount if
the dollar slips below 80 yen.
 EURO IN TRIANGLE
 The euro, which again failed to hold above $1.4000 overnight,
retreated to $1.3933, still up 0.3 percent on the day.
 Some traders cited simmering concerns on euro zone countries'
debt problems as weighing on the euro after the Irish bond yield
jumped almost 30 basis points on Monday, bringing its spread over
German bonds to a euro lifetime high.
 Still, with its moderate triangle holding pattern since
mid-October firmly in place, the lower end of the triangle around
$1.3750-70 is seen as a support and a good entry point for those
betting on a break above the triangle after the Fed meeting.
 The euro fetched 112.24 yen, up 0.3 percent on the day but
not far from a five-week low of 111.53 yen hit on Friday.
 The dollar index, a measure of its performance against six
major currencies, slipped 0.3 percent to 77.087.

 TOKYO, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The dollar extended tenuous
overnight gains on Tuesday after surprisingly strong U.S.
manufacturing data prompted more short-covering but rises were
seen limited ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting.
 The Fed is widely expected to announce a second round of
monetary easing on Wednesday, with markets generally priced for
the central bank to commit to buying at least $500 billion in
Treasury debt over the coming months to spur a flagging economy.
 Much uncertainty surrounds the scope and pace of bond
purchases, however, leaving the dollar vulnerable to choppy moves
in prevailing ranges.
 ""If the Fed's purchase is smaller than $500 billion, there
will be more dollar buying in the near term, though I suspect the
dollar will remain under pressure on expectations that the Fed
will eventually expand its asset purchases,"" said a trader at a
U.S. bank.
 Data on Monday showed surprisingly strong growth last month
in the U.S. manufacturing sector.
 Alan Ruskin, global head of G10 currency strategy at Deutsche
Bank, said it would provide fuel for Fed hawks who are dubious
about more easing and ""will tend to add to expectations that the
Fed will want maximum flexibility to turn off the printing press""
should strong economic data warrant it.
 The dollar rose to 80.71 yen, up about 0.3 percent from late
U.S. levels, though it remains within sight of the record low of
79.75 yen set in 1995.
 ""The market is turning cautious ahead of the Fed's meeting.
As the market position has been overwhelmingly short in the
dollar, the psychology at work here is that you should unwind
your position,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 Japanese investors and importers are also said to be bidding
the dollar, viewing its current level near record low as suitable

 Markets were keeping a wary eye on the currency pair, with
the risk of Japanese intervention to weaken the yen expected to
mount if the dollar slips below 80 yen.
 The U.S. congressional election on Tuesday is unlikely to
have any immediate impact on currencies, analysts said.
 EURO IN TRIANGLE
 The euro, which again failed to convincingly break above
$1.4000 overnight, retreated to $1.3890, flat on the day.
 Some traders cited simmering concerns on euro zone countries'
debt problems as weighing on the euro after the Irish bond yield
jumped almost 30 basis points on Monday, bringing its spread over
German bonds to a euro lifetime high.
 Still, with its moderate triangle holding pattern since
mid-October firmly in place, the lower end of the triangle around
$1.3750-70 is seen as a support and a good entry point for those
betting on a break above the triangle after the Fed meeting.
 The euro fetched 112.10 yen, up 0.3 percent on the day but
not far from a five-week low of 111.53 yen hit on Friday.
 The Australian dollar moved little from late U.S. levels at
US$0.9882 ahead of a policy announcement at 0330 GMT by the
Reserve Bank of Australia. It hit a post-float high of US$1.0004
on Oct. 15.
 In contrast with the Fed, the Australian central bank is
deciding whether to lift interest rates to dampen the risk of
price pressures building up due in part to an export boom.
 While official data showing tame inflation last week has
prompted markets to put chances of a hike in the 4.5 percent cash
rate on Tuesday at a slim 27 percent no one is ruling out
entirely the chance of a move.
 Should the RBA raise rates and signal more tightening to
come, the Australian dollar could retest parity against the
greenback.
 A decision to keep rates unchanged would probably see only
limited declines for the Aussie, as attention turns to the risk
of a rate hike at the December meeting.
 The Australian dollar ""has proven bullet-proof, and strong
Australian and Chinese PMIs suggest that dip-buying on 'no move'
is what everyone wants to do,"" said Kit Juckes, an analyst at
Societe Generale.

 SINGAPORE, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Asian stocks edged up after an
early fall while the dollar kept a tenuous grip on overnight
gains in Asia on Tuesday ahead of U.S. elections and a Federal
Reserve meeting that is expected to ease monetary policy.
 European markets opened a tad weaker after rising for three
consecutive sessions.
 The Australian dollar leapt after Australia's central bank
surprised markets and raised interest rates as a pre-emptive
strike against inflation.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside of Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> recovered after early falls to rise 0.4 percent
on gains in energy and materials and Hong Kong's Hang Seng
Index <.HSI> was also up after Chinese banks extended gains.
 Japan's Nikkei share average <.N225> closed up 0.1 percent
after touching a seven-week low though the broader-based Topix
index <.TOPX> shed 0.02 percent to a 19-month closing low,
under pressure from the yen's strength as it hovers close to a
record high against the dollar.
 They are down 13 percent and 12 percent so far this year,
respectively.
 Analysts said the Topix has been hit particularly hard by a
downbeat performance in the banking sector, on worries about
stricter global banking regulations, and by a series of equity
financings.
 ""The market is of course cautious until it sees the outcome
of the Fed meeting and the U.S. election, but Japanese stocks
are being pressured more by selling from real money investors,""
said Hiroaki Kuramochi, chief equity marketing officer at Tokai
Tokyo Securities.

 MONETARY EASING
 The dollar gave up some overnight gains in ranges that
tightened ahead of the Fed's policy meeting where it is widely
expected to announce a second round of monetary easing.
 Markets generally have priced in for the central bank to
commit to buying at least $500 billion in Treasury debt over
the coming months to spur a flagging economy. The Fed is also
expected to announce a programme of large-scale asset
purchases.
 The Fed will announce the outcome on Wednesday.

 The Australian dollar  surged 1.1 percent on the
day after the central bank raised interest rates by 25 basis
points to 4.75 percent.
 Most investors had expected the Reserve Bank of Australia
to hold rates steady at 4.5 percent after last week's benign
inflation report. The Australian dollar rallied as far as
$0.9981, from $0.9885 before the rate decision was announced.
 India's central bank raised interest rates for the sixth
time this year to tame inflation, and indicated that the
increase was likely to be its last in the near term. The
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised its lending and borrowing
rates by 25 basis points each, as expected by most analysts.
 Gold ticked up after a drop from a two-week high spurred
bargain hunting, but investors were reluctant to make big bets
ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, which could
determine the fate of the dollar.
 Gold  was up $5.1 to $1,355.35 by 0504 GMT, after
hitting a two-week high at $1,365.49 in Asia on Monday. Gold
struck a record around $1,387 last month.
 Oil also edged higher with investors cautious ahead of the
expected monetary easing from the U.S. Federal Reserve, capping
gains from Saudi Arabia's upward shift in price tolerance.
 U.S. crude for December  rose 12 cents to $83.07 a
barrel at 0258 GMT, while ICE Brent  nudged two cents
higher to $84.64.

Myung-bak and U.S. President Barack Obama have pledged to
settle their differences on a free trade deal before next
week's G20 summit, Lee's office said on Tuesday.
 The two countries are trying to resolve concerns raised by
U.S. auto and beef industries that are blocking congressional
approval of the pact that some studies said could boost their
$78 billion trade by as much as a quarter.
 The agreement was signed more than three years ago, and is
the largest signed by the United States since the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that went into force in
1984.
 ""The two leaders pledged on a telephone call to work to
agree on FTA before the G20 summit as a role model of promoting
free trade in the world and upgrading the alliance between the
two countries,"" Lee's office said in a statement.
 The White House said on Monday that negotiators would put
""maximum effort"" to resolve U.S. concerns on autos and beef by
the time Obama goes to Seoul. The pair are due to meet on the
sidelines of the summit on Nov. 11.
 Some U.S. lawmakers have said the deal does not do enough
to open South Korea's auto and beef markets. Sales of U.S.
autos have lagged behind European and Japanese cars despite
imported brands' growing acceptance in the market that is home
to the world's number-five carmaker, Hyundai Motor.
 South Korean officials have rejected the idea of reworking
the deal, saying it already offers a balanced way of expanding
bilateral trade that benefits both sides.
 Prime Minister Kim Hwang-shik told parliament on Tuesday
that the bottom line for South Korea is there cannot be any
revision or renegotiation of the deal that has already been
signed.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Oil prices and the dollar rose
on Monday, spurred by strong U.S. and Chinese manufacturing
data, as investors awaited mid-term U.S. congressional
elections and more monetary easing from the Federal Reserve in
the days ahead.
 U.S. factory activity in October expanded and construction
spending rose unexpectedly in September, reports showed. Other
data showed manufacturing in China expanded at the fastest pace
in six months in October. For details, see [ID:nEAP101100]
[ID:nCLA1ME66Q].
 Traders have for months been singularly focused on the Fed,
which appears very close to resuming an ambitious program of
large-scale asset purchases to stir the sluggish U.S. economic
recovery out of its doldrums. [ID:nN01161195]
 But investors were reluctant on Monday to make big bets
ahead of the election and the Fed's policy-setting meeting that
ends on Wednesday, events that could dictate the market's
direction well into new year.
 The Dow and S&P 500 posted slight gains while the Nasdaq
edged lower. Gold futures ended down a half percent,
 ""We had a handful of positive macroeconomic data points
which contributed to the better tone in markets today,"" said
Barry Knapp, managing director of equity research at Barclays
Capital in New York.
 ""But the lack of follow-through underscores that Republican
gains and an expansion of the Fed balance sheet are expected.""
 Republicans are poised to take control of the U.S. House of

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Monday
against the euro and yen as investors prepared for a midterm
U.S. congressional election and more monetary easing from the
Federal Reserve in the days ahead.
 Currency traders, like their brethren across markets, have
been singularly focused on the Fed for months now, and few
expect Tuesday's election to change that.
 The poll certainly had little impact on exchange rates on
Monday, when a surprisingly strong report on the U.S.
manufacturing sector that helped push the dollar higher. For
details, see [ID:nN01133257]]
 Yet if a fresh round of Fed easing is already priced in on
currency markets, some analysts say a big Republican election
victory, while widely predicted by opinion polls, may not be.
 Most agree the election will not have much immediate impact
on currencies. But some say enmity between Republicans and
Democratic President Barack Obama could paralyze U.S. fiscal
policy, leaving the Fed on its own to improve a weak economy.
 ""I think the election result is going to sneak up on the
currency market after the fact, because if we get a very
unhealthy stalemate on the fiscal side, I think it will have a
longer-term negative impact on the dollar,"" said Boris
Schlossberg, director of research at GFT Forex in New York.
 The dollar has lost 7.5 percent <.DXY> against major
currencies since September in anticipation of Fed easing. Most
economists expect the Fed to buy $80 billion to $100 billion in
assets per month, according to a Reuters poll, with total
purchases seen at anywhere from $250 billion to $2 trillion.

 But its decline has slowed in recent weeks, as traders
pared expectations of how aggressive the Fed might be and as
bets against the dollar swelled. [IMM/FX]
 The dollar was up 0.2 percent at 80.59 yen  while the
euro  slipped 0.4 percent to $1.3882.
 FED DOING HEAVY LIFTING
 Schlossberg said he thinks the Fed has opted to launch a
second round of easing -- it bought $1.7 trillion of Treasury
and mortgage debt in a first round -- partly because political
hurdles have made it harder to rely on fiscal stimulus.
 Congress passed a stimulus package of tax cuts and
government spending in 2009 now valued at $814 billion,
according to the Congressional Budget Office, but Republicans
and some Democrats have said it did little to help the economy
and have been hostile to talk of more federal spending.
 ""The Fed is not so naive as to think quantitative easing
will be a silver bullet,"" he said. ""But I think the reason
they're doing it is partly because they see a vacuum on the
fiscal side. That could get worse if we have gridlock and hurt
the dollar if markets view U.S. politics as unstable.""
 Some analysts, however, said the dollar could rally if a
new Congress succeeds in extending Bush-era tax cuts set to
expire in 2011.
 STRETCHED SHORT DOLLAR TRADE
 Nearer-term, the dollar's fortunes are very much dependent
on what the Fed does on Wednesday.
 ""Markets are expecting about $500 billion total over the
next two quarters, so if we get close to that, I think the
dollar struggles,"" said UBS strategist Amelia Bourdeau. ""But if
the Fed offers less, I think people will cover dollar shorts.""
 Dean Popplewell, chief strategist at FX brokerage OANDA in
Toronto, said he thinks the smart money is on more gradual
Fed approach, which should give the dollar a near-term boost.
 He said concern about the global impact of super loose U.S.
policy would also keep the Fed cautious.
 Dollar weakness forced Japan to intervene in currency
markets to weaken the yen last month for the first time since
2004, and intervention fears rose again on Monday after the
dollar spiked against the yen briefly in overnight trade.
 The dollar hit a 15-year low of 80.21 yen  and was
close to an all-time low around 79.75 yen.
 Once the Fed meeting is over, Popplewell said markets may
renew their focus on still lingering debt problems in Ireland,
Greece and other peripheral euro zone countries.
 ""I'd want to be changing tactics to start looking at Europe
more carefully, as the cracks are still there and that's not
good for the euro,"" he said. He predicted the currency could
retreat to the $1.3350-$1.35 range by year end but said further
losses would be capped by a weak U.S. holiday spending season.

 * Says he wants balanced economic growth
 * Hu to weigh global economic issues with Sarkozy this week

(Adds quotes, background, possible Areva contract)
 PARIS, Nov 1 (Reuters) - China is ready to work with other
countries to achieve balanced economic growth and will seek to
perfect its exchange rate system to increase the flexibility of
its yuan currency, President Hu Jintao told the French daily Le
Figaro in an interview published on Monday.
 Hu, who will discuss global economic issues with President
Nicolas Sarkozy during a Nov. 4-6 state visit to France, was
quoted by Le Figaro as saying it was important to promote fair,
balanced trade by fighting protectionism.
 ""In the future we will continue to perfect, according to the
principles of autonomy, controllability and progressiveness, our
floating and regulated exchange rate system to make the laws of
supply and demand work better and increase the yuan's
flexibility, to maintain a relative stability of our currency at
a fair and balanced level,"" Hu was quoted as saying.
 He said China's exchange rate policy was ""coherent and
responsible"", adding: ""We have always worked to advance the
reform of the mechanism of the yuan exchange rate.""
 Sarkozy is keen to engage China in global talks on economic
imbalances and currency fluctuations when France takes over the
presidency of the Group of 20 economic powers following a Nov.
10-12 summit of G20 leaders in Seoul.
 China holds the world's biggest foreign currency reserves,
having accumulated vast amounts of U.S. dollars and euro assets,
leading to criticism by U.S. officials that Beijing holds the
yuan artificially low against the dollar to support exports.
 Asked what China expected to come out of the Seoul summit,
Hu said he expected progress in four areas: reinforcing economic
policy coordination; pushing for a reform of the global
financial system and reinforcing market regulation; working on
global imbalances and fighting protectionism.
 ""To correct trade imbalances, the parties concerned must
transform their mode of development, restructure their economies
and promote fair and balanced trade by fighting any form of
protectionism,"" Hu said.
 The United States, which runs a huge trade deficit with
China, has played down expectations for major progress on
resolving imbalances.
 White House deputy national security adviser Michael Froman
said on Monday Washington did not foresee China bowing to
pressure in Seoul over the yuan, which remains weak even after
Beijing scrapped a peg to the dollar on June 19 and moved to a
more flexible exchange rate.
 Beijing has so far rejected Western efforts to draw it into
multilateral foreign exchange cooperation.
 Separately, Les Echos daily reported in a preview of its
Tuesday edition that French nuclear reactor maker Areva may sign
a $3 billion contract during Hu's visit to supply 20,000 tonnes
of uranium to the China Guangdong Nuclear Power Corp (CGNPC)
over 10 years.

 * Britain bans printer toners as passenger hand luggage

(adds Netherlands freight ban)
 By Tim Castle
 LONDON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Governments tightened aviation
security on Monday after two U.S-bound bombs sent in air cargo
from Yemen were intercepted in Dubai and Britain.
 The devices, discovered on Friday, were hidden in printers
and would have been powerful enough to destroy the planes
carrying them, Britain said.
 The plot highlighted what appeared to be a loophole in air
cargo security after Qatar Airways confirmed the Dubai parcel
had been transported on its passenger planes from the Yemeni
capital Sanaa via Doha. 
 Britain said it believed the attempt was organised by al
Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), but said it had no
information the organisation was planning further attacks.
 A U.S. official has said Saudi bomb maker Ibrahim Hassan
al-Asiri, believed to be working with AQAP, is a key suspect.
 As a precaution, Britain said it was banning air passengers
from taking large toner cartridges onto planes as hand luggage,
while Nigeria said it would improve the scanning of cargo bound
for the United States.
 Airline security in Africa's most populous country has come
under heightened scrutiny after a failed Christmas Day bombing
attempt on a U.S. airliner blamed on a Nigerian passenger with
explosives concealed in his underwear and claimed by AQAP.
 The Dutch anti-terrorism agency banned all airborne post and
freight from Yemen entering the Netherlands. Germany said it had
suspended passenger flights from Yemen, and was considering
expanding a cargo flight ban to other unnamed countries.
 Britain said it was also banning all air freight sent from
Somalia, adding to a ban on Yemen cargo flights imposed at the
weekend.
 
 EXPLOSIVES
 British Prime Minister David Cameron thanked the police and
intelligence operation whose efforts ""clearly prevented the
terrorists killing and maiming many innocent people whether here
or elsewhere in the world"".
 One of the packages was found on a United Parcel Service
cargo plane at East Midlands Airport, north of London, on
Friday. The other bomb was discovered in a parcel at a FedEx
facility in Dubai.
 The bomb found in Britain was hidden in a Hewlett Packard
printer and contained 400 grams of the highly potent explosive
pentaerythritol trinitrate (PETN), with the Dubai package
holding 300 grams, a German government source said. The
Christmas Day attack also used PETN.
 British authorities intervened after a tip-off from Saudi
intelligence was passed on by German authorities, the German
source added.
 The BBC, citing unidentified British officials, said the
information came from an al Qaeda member who turned himself into
Saudi authorities.
 The plot could fuel calls for the wider use of imaging
technology designed to detect explosives, which is not standard,
but freight firms are reluctant to bear the full cost.
 Tighter international air cargo security rules could deal a
blow to trade and the world economy as it recovers from the
global recession. According to airlines association IATA, about
35 percent of the value of world trade is carried by air.
 Freight firms clashed with U.S. and European policy makers
last year over calls for 100 percent scanning of sea containers.
Plans to introduce full scanning from 2012 were postponed.
 Airlines could also face pressure to put less cargo on
passenger planes or improve blast protection.
 An Israeli security expert said it would have been ""nearly
impossible"" to spot the Yemeni bombs using standard X-ray
machines.
 ""The structure of a printer is so dense that it is very
difficult to spot explosives or a detonator through visual
screening,"" said Yuval Amsterdam of Tamar Explosive Simulants
Technologies, which produces dummy bombs for security drills.
 
 FREIGHT SECURITY
 Philip Baum, editor of Aviation Security International
magazine, said new technology would not eliminate the risk or
airline attacks.
 ""The only thing that has prevented things has either been
good luck or people,"" he told Reuters.
 Interior minister Theresa May said Britain would review all
aspects of air freight security.
 ""At this stage we have no information to suggest that
another attack of a similar nature by al Qaeda in the Arabian
Peninsula is imminent,"" May told parliament.
 ""But this organisation is very active. It continues to plan
other attacks in the region, notably against Saudi Arabia.
 ""We therefore work on the assumption that this organisation
will wish to continue to find ways of also attacking targets
further afield.""
 Britain's toner ban adds to the list of items passengers are
already barred from carrying on board.
 Restrictions on the carrying of liquids on planes were
introduced in 2006 after the discovery of an al Qaeda-inspired
plot to blow up transatlantic flights with explosive materials
concealed as soft drinks.
 In Sanaa, cheering Yemenis greeted the student detained
briefly on suspicion of having sent the bombs.
 Yemeni police arrested computer science student Hanan
al-Samawi on Friday after tracing her through a telephone number
left with a freight company but released her the next day,
saying she had been a victim of identity theft.
 A U.S. technical team has arrived in Yemen to train Yemenis
in the use of sophisticated airport screening equipment, a
government official told Reuters.

Monday renewed U.S. sanctions against Sudan's government,
keeping pressure on Khartoum to stick to the timetable for
holding a referendum that could split the country in two.
 But Washington also held out for the prospect for
reconsidering its tough approach if Sudanese leaders make
progress in resolving the country's bitter north-south dispute
and improving the situation in the troubled Darfur region.
 Sudan is 10 weeks away from the scheduled start of a
referendum that could lead to independence for its
oil-producing south. If mishandled, the referendum could
destabilize the region.
 The White House issued a letter from Obama to Congress
saying he was extending long-standing economic sanctions, a
notice required by law each year to keep them in place.
 The measures restrict trade and investment in Sudan and
also block the assets of the Sudanese government and certain
officials, among other things.
 With trust low as both sides in the referendum exchange
recriminations, progress has slowed on resolving volatile
disputes such as the status of the oil-producing Abyei region,
determining citizenship and forging an oil-sharing accord.
 White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said the United States
hoped Sudan's leaders ""will make the urgent and difficult
choices necessary to secure peace for the Sudanese people.""
 ""As we work to support these choices, the United States
will review the Sudanese government's progress on resolving
outstanding (peace agreement) implementation issues as well as
other relevant circumstances, to include improving security and
humanitarian access in Darfur,"" he said.
 ""If the government of Sudan acts to improve the situation
on the ground and advance peace, we stand ready to work with
Sudan to ensure its rightful place in the international
community.
 Obama last week stressed the need to go ahead with the vote
as scheduled when he spoke to former South African President
Thabo Mbeki, who has tried to overcome obstacles in the
north-south peace process as head of an African Union panel.

 SAO PAULO/MEXICO CITY, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Latin American
stocks rose on Monday on upbeat U.S. and Chinese manufacturing
data while investors reacted favorably to Dilma Rousseff's
decisive victory in Brazil's presidential election.
 Data showed U.S. manufacturing activity and construction
spending increased in September while industrial activity in
China rose in October. [ID:nEAP101100] and [ID:nCLA1ME66Q]
 China is a primary buyer of Latin American commodities and
Brazil's leading trade partner, while Mexico sends roughly 80
percent of its exports to the United States.
 The MSCI Latin American stocks index <.MILA00000PUS> added
0.6 percent. Brazil's Bovespa <.BVSP> rose 1.43 percent.
 ""The gains are being supported by ... China's good showing

 By Walker Simon
 NEW YORK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Stocks, commodities and the
dollar rose on Monday after manufacturing strengthened in the
United States and China, the world's two largest economies,
while gold and U.S. Treasury debt prices fell.
 The pace of growth in U.S. manufacturing quickened in
October, suggesting a sluggish economic recovery may be gaining
some traction, according to an industry report. For details
see, [ID:nN01133614].
 China's official purchasing managers' index, or PMI, for
manufacturing blew past expectations in October to hit a
six-month high. [ID:nTOE6A001P]. The benchmark Shanghai
Composite Index <.SSEC> of shares rose 2.5 percent.
 The dollar gained against the euro and yen after the
Institute of Supply Management said its index of U.S. factory
activity for last month rose to the highest since May and
separate data showed U.S. construction spending rose in
September to a one-year high.
 The euro  fell 0.46 percent against the dollar to
$1.3883. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was up
0.34 percent at 80.66 yen.
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY>, which measures the greenback
against major currencies, rose 0.05 percent to 77.3016.
 ""The dollar is starting to rebound a little bit off the
better-than-expected ISM data. But we're still within the
ranges we have seen the last couple of days,"" said Greg
Michalowski, chief currency analyst at the New York-based
online broker FXDD.
 The greenback came under pressure in past sessions against
most major currencies, albeit within recent ranges, as the
market geared up for the Federal Reserve to step up money
printing after its two-day policy meeting ends on Wednesday.
 Reflecting gains in global equities markets, the MSCI's
all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.37
percent.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares rose 0.13 percent to close at 1,088.01 -- a near
one-week closing high. But the index had pared gains from
earlier in the session when it hit a high of 1,094.74 points.
 A POSITIVE WIND ON WALL STREET
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
up 50.86 points, or 0.46 percent, at 11,169.35. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 4.64 points, or 0.39 percent, at
1,187.90. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 3.83
points, or 0.15 percent, at 2,511.24.
 ""The (U.S.) data today reinforces that we have a
sustainable"" U,S. expansion, said Henry Smith, chief investment
officer of Haverford Trust Co. in Philadelphia.
 ""It's good to see the market reacting to the positive data,
although our expectation is that ... this might be short-lived
because it has the feel that we're buying into the two big
pieces of news this week,"" he said referring to U.S. midterm
elections on Tuesday and the Fed's announcement on Wednesday.
 Financial markets are gearing up for the Federal Reserve's
Wednesday announcement, expected to spell out how much it will
stimulate the economy via quantitative easing, a process
expected to involve the Fed's purchases of Treasury debt.
 How much QE the Fed will do is a major uncertainty for
markets. A recent Reuters poll found most economists expect the
Fed to buy $80 to $100 billion in assets per month.
 Adding to uncertainty are U.S. elections on Tuesday. Polls
show control of the U.S. House of Representatives is expected
to pass into Republican hands.
 Bucking the global uptrend for equities: Japan's Nikkei
<.N225> lost 0.52 percent to end at 9,154.72, a seven-week
closing low. During Tokyo's trading session, the yen briefly
jumped to nearly a record high against the dollar. A strong yen
hurts Japan's exporters' shares because it makes their goods
more expensive abroad.
 CHINA SYNDROME LIFTS OIL
The data from China, which has a voracious appetite for oil
and is the world's biggest consumer of metals, helped lift
energy and commodities prices. More demand is anticipated from
China.
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  rose $2.02, or 2.49
percent, to $83.46 per barrel,
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index <.CRB>, a gauge of
commodities and energy prices, was up 0.53 percent,
 But gold prices  fell $5.70, or 0.42 percent, to
$1,353.30. A stronger dollar usually weighs on gold since the
precious metal, which is priced in greenbacks, becomes less
attractive to non-U.S. purchasers.
 U.S. Treasuries fell after stronger-than-expected data on
manufacturing and construction spending bolstered stocks and
undermined the safe-haven appeal of government debt.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 8/32, with the yield at 2.638 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was down 1/32, with the yield at
0.3475 percent.
 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was down 18/32,
with the yield at 4.025 percent.

 * Too early to judge cost impact, industry says
 * Pressure seen to move cargo off passenger planes
 
 By Tim Hepher
 PARIS, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Airlines could face pressure to put
less cargo on passenger planes or improve blast protection after
one of the parcels in the Yemen bomb plot was found to have
flown in a passenger jet, analysts said on Monday.
 Market reaction to Friday's discovery of bombs hidden in two
U.S.-bound parcels showed some signs of 'scare fatigue' compared
with the jitters caused by a failed plot to blow up a passenger
plane over Detroit in 2009 or April's volcanic ash crisis.
 But concerns over a possible weak link in air security grew
after Qatar Airways confirmed on Saturday that it had carried an
explosive package that was later seized in Dubai. The parcel had
been flown from Yemen with a stopover in the Qatari capital
Doha.
 ""This certainly reinforces the desire to get cargo,
including packages, off passenger airplanes,"" said George
Hamlin, president of Hamlin Transportation Consulting in
Fairfax, Virginia.
 ""That's not a piece of economic good news for the passenger
carriers, particularly the international ones whose making of a
profit very often depends on carrying cargo in the belly on long
haul international flights. 
 ""Cargo on domestic flights in the U.S. is a fraction of what
it used to be because FedEx and UPS have taken that market over,
but it's still very important in the economics of the
international passenger business.""
 According to airines association IATA, about 35 percent of
the value of world trade is carried by air.
 Airbus says approximately 60 percent of global freight tonne
kilometres (the amount of freight times the distance flown) are
carried in dedicated freighter aircraft.
 Many airlines said on Monday they were already implementing
tough security standards or stepping them up.
 
 'SECURITY WORKING'
 Shares in United Parcel Service and FedEx both rose with
other stocks in early New York trading despite the discovery of
the two parcel bombs in their networks.
 ""The market hasn't reacted to this latest security scare
because this isn't a new threat from a new group. It is an
ongoing threat from the same enemy, which has worked out how to
do things differently,"" said Howard Wheeldon, Senior Strategist
at BGC Partners in London.
 Other airline stocks were mixed with narrow changes.
 ""We think the interception of these packages shows that
security is working, and think new heightened security measures
will ease public fear and improve chances at further detection,""
said Jim Corridore at Standard & Poor's Equity Research.
 Companies like UPS, FedEx and European competitors like TNT
use a combination of their own planes and other airline
networks or else road-trucking to deliver parcels door-to-door.
 During the global economic crisis companies around the world
bought fewer goods for delivery by air, hurting airline profits.
 However, in recent months companies had to restock inventory
in a rush when demand for goods and services picked up again
after the economic crisis. British Airways' mid-year cargo
sales, which are 8 percent of its total, rose 39 percent.
 Cargo carried in passenger planes must be scanned but
governments have for years debated whether to expand this to
all-cargo planes. A 2007 Congressional report said the
technology did not exist to do this affordably for all freight.
 Officials have focused on a mixture of x-ray scanning and
risk assessments based on evaluating shippers.
 Officials have also considered using tougher materials like
kevlar to replace the aluminium containers used to load cargo.
But the Congressional report found increased costs may prevent
passenger airlines from competing with all-cargo carriers.
 ""It's not clear at this stage whether (governments) will
require cargo and freight operators to acquire and use a lot of
new equipment,"" said Rob Stallard of RBC Capital Markets.
 ""With that in mind, I don't expect that there will be a
major impact on specific U.S.S stock prices at this stage, and
certainly not something that will buck the underlying trends.""
 Still, expectations of demand for new security equipment
lifted shares in Britain's Smiths Industries and France's Safran
, which make advanced explosives scanners. 
 Dutch logistics group TNT played down the costs. ""I don't
expect much for the short term but we will have to see what
measures get imposed longer term,"" Finance Director Bernard Bot
told Reuters Insider. (http://link.reuters.com/suz2)

 By Ann Saphir
 CHICAGO, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Nasdaq OMX Group's  two
options trading venues together handled more traffic than rival
markets for a second straight month, figures from the Options
Clearing Corp showed on Monday.
 But those bragging rights came under immediate fire from
Deutsche Boerse -owned International Securities
Exchange, which repeated its view that Nasdaq unfairly inflates
its market share with trades linked to bets on stock
dividends.
 More than a quarter of the 77.8 million contracts traded in
October at Nasdaq's PHLX, formerly known as the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange, were so-called dividend trades, ISE estimates
released on Monday showed. The trades provide little economic
value and pose a threat to market stability, ISE said.
 Nasdaq, which gets almost no revenue from the trades, says
they are legitimate and should not be treated differently. The
exchange operator, which also runs the smaller NOM venue,
handled 92.9 million contracts in October, or 27.2 percent of
all U.S. stock and stock-index trades.
 CBOE Holdings Inc, which launched its own second exchange
on Friday, handled 26.6 percent of all trading, while NYSE
Euronext , which operates Amex and NYSE Arca options,
handled 24.3 percent.
 ISE trailed at No. 4 with just 18 percent of the total,
highlighting concerns that its Frankfurt-based parent will be
forced to write down a large chunk of the value of the New
York-based options market.
 Deutsche Boerse warned last week that such a write-off was
likely, following an earlier charge taken a year ago.
[ID:nLDE69R1LY]
 ISE, the only major options-exchange operator to have just
one venue, is considering starting its own second market to win
back customers.
 All nine U.S. options exchanges together handled 342
million contracts last month, up 3.5 percent from last year.

 * US ISM manufacturing report spurs dollar short-covering

 * Euro down vs dollar, euro/sterling weighs
(Recasts lead, adds quote, U.S. data, updates prices)
 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The dollar firmed against the
euro and yen on Monday after stronger-than-expected U.S.
manufacturing data, though gains were fleeting as markets
braced for more monetary easing from the Federal Reserve this
week.
 The Fed is likely to announce on Wednesday a fresh round of
quantitative easing under which the U.S. central bank would buy
bonds and essentially flood the economy with dollars in an
attempt to revitalize it. That should push Treasury yields
lower and diminish the allure of some U.S. assets, forcing
investors to seek higher returns elsewhere.
 An above-forecast October reading of U.S. manufacturing
conditions from the Institute for Supply Management on Monday
did nothing to significantly change the market's view on the
expected easing.
 Most economists expect the Fed to buy $80 billion to $100
billion in assets per month, according to a Reuters poll.
Estimates of total purchases ranged from $250 billion to $2
trillion.
 ""The dollar is starting to rebound a little bit off the
better-than-expected ISM data. But we're still within the
ranges we have seen the last couple of days,"" said Greg
Michalowski, chief currency analyst at the New York-based
online broker FXDD.
 ""I think the market was expecting a weaker ISM to keep the
dollar on the defensive going into all the events this week.
But the data came in strong so traders were forced to cover
some of their short positions.""
 Japanese intervention fears came to the fore again on
Monday after a spike in the dollar versus the yen following the
pair's fall to a fresh 15-year low. That further added
uncertainty to a market already jittery about Wednesday's Fed
decision, although trades were confined to a narrow price
range.
 In midday trading, the dollar was up less than 0.1 percent
against a basket of six currencies at 77.285.
 DOLLAR PULLBACK?
 Some analysts said dollar short positions have become
overstretched as investors priced in aggressive Fed easing,
leaving scope for a pullback in the dollar if the Fed announces
a smaller round of purchases.
 ""The dollar is clearly oversold, and it's possible we could
see a rally in the dollar index maybe up to 79 or 80. But it's
pretty clear that we want a lower dollar to help our exports,""
said Tom Samuelson, chief investment officer at Advanced
Equities Asset Management in Scottsdale, Arizona.
 The firm, a global asset allocation company, has assets
under management of $740 million, investing as well in fixed
income and commodities.
 Analysts said the market remained fairly short dollars
heading into the Fed meeting but short-term players have
lightened some positions, latest CFTC data showed.
 There are also significant events this week, leaving most
investors sidelined, traders said. As well as the Fed, there
are four other major policy decisions this week -- in
Australia, the euro zone, UK and Japan -- with key U.S. jobs
data due Friday.
 The euro was down 0.5 percent at $1.3879 after climbing to
$1.4012 overnight.
 The euro was also weighed down by gains in the pound,
traders said, after UK data showed an above-consensus
manufacturing index. The recent strength in UK data, including
a stronger-than-expected gross domestic product reading for the
third quarter, has pushed out expectations the Bank of England
will engage in quantitative easing.
 The euro was down 0.4 percent at 0.8660.
 The dollar rose 0.4 percent to 80.68 yen, mostly on the ISM
data. It earlier spiked more than one yen to 81.60 yen in Asian
trade.
 The Australian dollar was up 0.3 percent at US$0.9865,
buoyed by strong data from China, the biggest buyer of
Australian commodities..
 Australia's central bank is expected to leave rates on hold
on Tuesday following recent below-forecast inflation data, but
there is a risk of a 25 basis-point hike.

 NEW YORK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Stocks, commodities and the
dollar rose on Monday after manufacturing strengthened in the
United States and China, the world's two largest economies,
while U.S. Treasuries prices and gold fell.
 The pace of growth in U.S. manufacturing quickened in
October, suggesting a sluggish economic recovery may be gaining
some traction, according to an industry report. For details
see, [ID:nN01133614].
 China's official purchasing managers index (PMI) for
manufacturing, for October blew past expectations to rise to a
six-month high. [ID:nTOE6A001P]. The benchmark Shanghai
Composite Index <.SSEC> of shares rose 2.5 percent.
 ""There's been a lack of good economic news and this is
certainly helpful with the market particularly up here and
earnings expectations remaining high,"" said Bruce Bittles,
chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co in
Nashville.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose
0.77 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst <.FTEU3> index of
top shares rose 0.5 percent to 1091 points.
 The dollar gained against the euro and yen on Monday after
Institute of Supply Management said its index of U.S. factory
activity for last month rose to the highest since May.
 The euro  fell 0.37 percent against the dollar at
$1.3896. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  rose 0.24
percent at 80.58 from a previous session close of 80.390.
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY>, which measures the greenback
against major currencies, rose 0.15 percent to 77.386.
 The dollar has come under pressure recently as markets
geared up for the Federal Reserve's meeting on Tuesday and
Wednesday, which is expected to end in a decision to stimulate
the economy via quantitative easing.
 How much QE the Fed will do is a major uncertainty for
markets. A recent Reuters poll found most economists expect the
Fed to buy $80 to $100 billion in assets per month.
 Also adding to uncertainty are U.S. elections on Tuesday.
Polls show control of the U.S. House of Representatives is
expected to pass into Republican hands.
 U.S. stocks rose, helped by advances in commodities
companies. Separate data showed U.S. construction spending rose
in September, driven by a one-year high in investment in public
projects.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 45.82
points, or 0.41 percent, at 11,164.31. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 5.26 points, or 0.44 percent, at
1,188.52. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 2.29
points, or 0.09 percent, at 2,509.70.
 The data from China, the world's biggest consumer of metals
with a voracious appetite for oil, helped lift energy and
commodities prices, with more anticipated demand seen.
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  rose $2.11, or 2.59
percent, to $83.54 per barrel,
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index <.CRB>, a gauge of
commodities and energy prices, was up 0.84 percent.
 But gold prices  fell $5.70, or 0.42 percent, to
$1353.30. A stronger dollar usually weighs on gold since the
precious metal, which is priced in greenbacks, becomes less
attractive to non-U.S. purchasers.
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> lost 0.52 percent, hurt by a weaker
dollar during its trading session, which makes the country's
exports less competitive.
 U.S. Treasuries prices briefly turned negative on Monday
after stronger-than-expected data on manufacturing and
construction spending bolstered stocks and undermined the
safe-haven appeal of government debt.
 After briefly trading lower, benchmark 10-year notes
 slipped 6/32 in price to yield 2.63 percent, while
the 30-year bond  was 17/32 lower to yield 4.02
percent.

 By Patricia Zengerle
 WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Negotiators will put ""maximum
effort"" toward resolving objections in the U.S. Congress to a
U.S.-South Korean free-trade agreement by the time President
Barack Obama goes to Seoul on Nov. 10, an administration
official said on Monday.
 The United States and South Korea are trying to resolve
beef and auto concerns blocking U.S. congressional approval of
the trade pact by Nov. 10. Obama meets with President Lee
Myung-bak in Seoul on Nov. 11.
 The trade deal was signed in June 2007 but has languished
in the face of opposition in Congress. Obama pledged at the
last G20 meeting, in Toronto in June, to push to remove
obstacles to the deal by this month's trip.
 ""The president has long said we want to try and address the
outstanding issues regarding the FTA in order to bring it
forward for approval,"" Mike Froman, deputy national security
advisor for international economic affairs, said. ""Those
outstanding issues fall largely in the area of autos and beef.
 ""Those discussions are under way. I can't predict at this
point how they will proceed but we're going to put every effort
into achieving ... an acceptable agreement, a satisfactory
agreement, by the time the president comes to Seoul,"" he told a
news conference in advance of Obama's departure for Asia on
Friday.
 The pact has been stalled in the U.S. Congress by many U.S.
lawmakers from Midwestern auto states who say it does not do
enough to tear down non-tariff barriers that they blame for low
U.S. autos sales in the South Korean market.
 Other farm state lawmakers want Seoul to completely open
its market to U.S. beef by accepting beef from all ages of
cattle, not just those under 30 months.
 Obama's 10-day trip will take him to India, Indonesia,
South Korea and Japan. It will include a G20 summit in Seoul
and an Asia-Pacific leaders summit in Japan.
 Froman declined to discuss specifics when asked whether
Washington had a target in mind for U.S. auto sales to South
Korea or whether U.S. negotiators had proposed that Seoul allow
imports of autos that meet U.S. safety and emissions
standards/
 ""We've had a series of discussions about a range of issues
in the auto sector,"" he said. ""Those discussions will continue
over the next week and a half or so in the run-up to the
president's visit.
 ""We're going to put maximum effort into trying to resolve
the outstanding issues by the time of the president's trip,"" he
said.

 By Lamine Ghanmi
 AGADIR, Morocco, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The Group of 20 leading
economies must do more to strengthen international supervision
of the financial sector, International Monetary Fund chief
Dominique Strauss-Kahn said on Monday.
 G20 leaders are due to meet in South Korea on Nov. 11-12 for
a summit which is expected to focus on tackling imbalances in
the world economy and reducing the risk of a currency war.
 Speaking at a conference on human development in the
Moroccan city of Agadir, Strauss-Kahn said the financial sector
-- blamed by many for triggering the global economic downturn --
also remained a preoccupation.
 ""The G20 heads of state who met in London, Pittsburgh,
Toronto and shortly in South Korea, said strongly and loudly for
the population of the world to hear them, they will fix it (the
financial sector),"" Strauss-Kahn said.
 ""The reality is unfortunately more complex than this. The
most difficult part in the field of regulation has been done.""
 ""But more and more has to be done in the area of
international supervision. You can have the best regulation in
the world but if its implementation is not supervised, it will
not be of any use,"" he said.
 
 ""NEW COLONIALISM""
 In a question-and-answer session at the conference about
development in Africa, the IMF chief said the world needed to
guard against a new form of colonialism as emerging powers
increase their influence on the continent.
 He did not single out any countries, but some rights
campaigners and opposition movements in Africa have accused
China of exploiting African resources. Beijing says it brings
investment and aid to areas ignored by other countries.
 ""If we don't pay enough attention, it will be like we ended
one century-and-a-half of unequal trade, and we will enter
another era of unequal trade, this time spearheaded by emerging
countries,"" Strauss-Kahn said.
 ""We have to guard against another form of colonialism taking
root by other superpowers who have the wind in their sails in
Africa, who are, I don't want to use the word colonialism, but
who are setting up a form of dominance.""
 These emerging powers were pursuing their objectives in
Africa ""using interference with national policy in these
countries, using the size of their state compared to the smaller
ones in Africa"". Strauss-Kahn said.

 By Alister Bull
 WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The United States said on
Monday it does not foresee China bowing to pressure over its
yuan currency during a Group of 20 summit in Seoul, playing
down expectations for major progress on global economic
imbalances.
 ""We do not expect the China currency issue, or the
imbalance issue to be solved once and for all in Seoul. This is
part of an ongoing effort,"" Michael Froman, White House deputy
national security adviser, told reporters.
 President Barack Obama's will attend the G20 in South Korea
Nov. 10-12 during a 10-day tour of Asia, when he will also
visit India, Indonesia and Japan on a mission to deepen trade
ties to boost U.S. exports and jobs back home.
 His departure on the longest foreign trip of his presidency
so far will be just three days after U.S. congressional
elections, in which Obama's Democrats are expected to be
punished by voters for stubbornly high U.S. unemployment.
 The G20 forms a central part of the president's economic
efforts in Asia, which also includes a meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Japan, and a speech
to a U.S.-India business summit to promote corporate America.
 U.S. officials say they are also working hard to remove
remaining obstacles to advancing a long-stalled free trade pact
with South Korea in time for Obama's meeting with South Korean
President Lee Myung-bak during his visit to Seoul.
 G20 played a vital coordination role during the 2008 global
financial crisis. But that spirit of collaboration has frayed
since growth resumed, amid concern some countries might aid
exports through competitive currency devaluations, and
officials said Obama would emphasize cooperation.
 ""The risk is increasingly clear that uncoordinated and
unilateral actions could undermine the strong, sustained and
balanced growth that we all need in the G-20,"" said Treasury
Under Secretary for International Affairs Lael Brainard.
 ECONOMIC IMBALANCES
 U.S. officials say China holds the value of the yuan
artificially low against the dollar to support exports, adding
to a massive surplus in trade with the United States that
Washington would like to ease by getting Beijing to let the
yuan rise.
 ""It is very important to see China move forward on its
commitment to a market-determined exchange rate that reflects
market fundamentals,"" Brainard said.
 ""We saw an accelerated pace of appreciation between early
September and the time that we released a statement on October
15. If we continue to see progress of that nature, it would
make a material difference,"" she said.
 Obama will hold a face-to-face meeting with Chinese
President Hu Jintao on the sidelines of the G20, giving them an
opportunity to discuss the matter further.
 The U.S. president will press other G20 leaders to endorse
a framework already laid out by finance ministers to get
countries to push their current account balances toward more
sustainable levels -- but will not aim for numeric targets.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner had initially
suggested adopting a current account target of 4 percent of GDP
for both trade deficit and surplus countries.
 But this got little support from the big surplus nations
and Chinese officials flatly say a fixed target will not work
for them, although they stress that the two countries should
continue to work with each other to ease the imbalances issue.
 What Washington wants is for the big surplus countries like
China and Germany to use ""all the tools at their disposal"" to
boost domestic demand to suck in more exports, Brainard said.
 Economists say the main tool to achieve this goal is
currency adjustment.

(Adds comments, updates prices)
 By Samantha Pearson and Caroline Stauffer
 SAO PAULO/MEXICO CITY, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Brazil's real
firmed on Monday, the day after Dilma Rousseff of the ruling
Workers' Party won the country's presidential election, with
the dollar broadly weaker.
 In her victory speech, she vowed to maintain job and credit
growth, encourage Brazilians to save more and maintain
discipline in the government budget. [ID:nN01120007]
 The Brazilian real  bid 0.29 percent stronger at
1.696 reais per U.S. dollar on the local spot market.
 Analysts said the move was largely in line with the rest of
global markets. Many emerging market currencies also firmed on
Monday due to the broadly weaker dollar and strong Chinese
factory data. [ID:nTOE6A0044]
 The presidential election has largely been considered a
""non-event"" on trading floors across the world. Rousseff, who
had been widely expected to win, is likely to continue the
current economic policies that have transformed Brazil into one
of the world's hottest emerging markets. [ID:nN01120007]
 ""It's having absolutely no effect. Dilma was already priced
into the market. This is not news,"" said Rodrigo Nassar, head
of trading at brokerage Hencorp Commcor in Sao Paulo.
 But parts of Rousseff's victory speech did catch the
attention of some analysts.
 ""She gave the impression in her speech that she might
follow more aggressive economic policies, that she would take a
harsher line against the appreciation of the real,"" said Andre
Perfeito, an economist at Gradual Investimentos in Sao Paulo.
 Brazil has already introduced a series of tax hikes this
month in an effort to curb a jump in the real that is hurting
exporters and widening the current account deficit.
 The speech also included some tough talk about government
spending, which some traders took as a sign that interest rates
may eventually fall under her watch. [ID:nN01259153]
 But investors will be reluctant to make any hard bets on
the new government until it becomes clear who will make up
Rousseff's economic team, Perfeito said.
 Others said the speech gave few clues about what lies
ahead. ""She indicated nothing, she gave absolutely no sign of
any type of (currency) intervention,"" said Commcor's Nassar.
""It's way too early to speculate about this.""
 EYES ON THE FED
 Volume was expected to be low on Monday, one day ahead of a
public holiday in Brazil. Given that Rousseff's victory was
largely expected, many investors extended their weekend and
took Monday off.
 Trading volumes were also down across the region because of
public holidays in Chile on Monday and in Mexico on Tuesday.
 The Mexican currency  was initially boosted by the
weak dollar but later traded flat at 12.3350 per dollar.
 The dollar has suffered heavy losses recently, boosting
many currencies around the world, as investors prepare for a
fresh round of monetary easing in the United States.
 The Federal Reserve is expected to announce a round of
asset-buying this week, which should keep returns on U.S.
Treasuries close to record lows and encourage investors to buy
more of Latin America's higher-yielding debt.
 Brazil is likely to be a prime target given that the
country's benchmark interest rate of 10.75 percent is one of
the highest in the world.

 * Defence, tech firms vulnerable if euro breaches $1.50
 
 By Harpreet Bhal and Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - European exporters have so far
survived the euro's recent gains, with German industrials among
the most resilient, but a break above $1.50 will likely hit
defence and technology firms hard.
 Currency volatility has prompted firms to employ more active
strategies to absorb foreign exchange-related shocks to their
profits, particularly as the dollar is expected to continue
suffering on speculation of further U.S. quantitative easing.
 The euro hit a nine-month high against a broadly weak dollar
around $1.4150 last month. So far this year, the single currency
has traded in a volatile range of roughly $1.19 hit in June and
$1.46 struck at the beginning of the year.
 ""We have to bear in mind that Europe is very used to dealing
with a strong euro, but if we go back up to say $1.50 that will
start to cause quite a bit of pain for selected companies,"" said
Thomas Beevers, a fund manager at Newton Asset Management.
 Analysts said defence firms which have a large euro cost
base would be hit hardest by the euro's rise to $1.50, a level
last seen in late 2009, with technology firms also at risk due
to fierce competition from the United States.
 ""The (European) sectors that are most at risk are the ones
where the Americans are actually strong like defence, IT and
software but not in machinery or cars,"" said Lothar Mentel,
chief investment officer at Octopus Investments.
 EADS, which earns around 75 percent of its revenue in U.S
dollars, looks particularly vulnerable as a weak dollar hurts
competitive pricing and margins at its Airbus unit.
 ""Given that each 1 U.S cent movement in the effective rate
(after hedging) impacts (EADS) EBIT by 100 million euros... the
recent 10 cent movement is worrisome,"" Citigroup analysts wrote.
 In the tech space, firms such as SAP and Nokia are
vulnerable to competition from U.S. counterparts Apple and
Oracle, Mentel said, and could lose out in terms of pricing to
emerging markets. 
 
 GERMAN RESILIENCE
 Analysts see the larger German exporters as more resilient
to FX fluctuations, having adapted their businesses to absorb
currency strength from the days of the deutschemark.
 ""German firms have had many decades of dealing with a strong
currency. In the last 10 years they have remained competitive in
a global market place by keeping a lid on wages and
cost-cutting,"" Beevers said, citing Siemens as an example.
 Despite the euro having some room to appreciate before
exporters start feeling a real pinch, investors may be swayed to
reassess their holdings as valuations creep up.
 ""The exporters have had a strong run this year. We think the
currency is a reason for some caution so wouldn't put more money
into the names but we wouldn't aggressively sell either,"" said
Graham Secker, European equity strategist at Morgan Stanley.
 Thomson Reuters data shows EADS's forward price-to-earnings
(P/E) is at 17, and Safran at 17.2, greater than STOXX Europe
600 industrial goods and services index's 15.45.
 SAP and Nokia trade at forward P/E of 17.16 and 13.73,
against the STOXX Europe 600 technology index's 15.85.
 
 MORE ACTIVE HEDGING
 The euro's rebound versus the dollar since June caught many
in the market off guard, and analysts said its 17 percent rally
through October is causing a headache for some exporters.
 ""It's the move that hurts, rather than the level,"" said
Stacy Williams, director of FX quantitative strategy at HSBC,
adding that firms have become more active about hedging.
 Traditionally, this has meant using forward contracts to
lock in specific currency rates, but some are turning to more
sophisticated methods that enable them to deal more effectively
with sudden market movements higher or lower.
""A large portion of the increase in hedging that we've seen
has been in derivatives and structured products, rather than
'vanilla' forwards,"" said Alex Sullivan, global head of
corporate foreign exchange at currency broker World First.
 As the euro climbs, companies are forced to pick up euros at
less-than-favourable rates, while also scrambling to buy
protection before the currency rises even more.
 Given the market's tendency of sharp turnarounds this year,
some firms are buying products which allow them to act on
reverse moves in the euro, rather than being locked in at
specific levels under forward contracts.
 Mark Thompson, senior dealer at corporate currency services
provider CorporateFX, said firms which hedged when the euro was
weaker are in a relatively safe position at the moment.
 At the same time, he said other exporters hurting from euro
strength are waiting for a pullback from current levels to put
on positions to protect themselves from a further euro rally.
""Exporters who haven't had structures in place are trying to
get in once the market gets back to $1.35,"" he said, adding that
he sees the psychological level of $1.50 as a ""danger zone"".

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The dollar slipped against a
major currency basket on Monday as markets braced for expected
Federal Reserve easing this week that could push Treasury
yields lower and diminish the allure of U.S. assets.
 Japanese intervention fears came to the fore once again
after what seemed like an erroneous spike in the dollar versus
the yen following the pair's fall to a fresh 15-year low. That
further added uncertainty to a market already jittery about
Wednesday's Fed decision although price action remained
confined to narrow trading ranges.
 ""The market is probably still expecting that quantitative
easing will be bigger than what has already been priced into
the market and that is dollar-negative,"" said Boris
Schlossberg, director of FX research at GFT in New York.
 ""You're just seeing these rangebound movements between
$1.39 and $1.40 in the euro because I don't think there is any
consensus yet on how the Fed is going to react on Wednesday.""
 A recent Reuters poll found that most economists expect the
Fed to buy $80 to $100 billion in assets per month, with totals
ranging widely from $250 billion to $2 trillion.
 ""The fact that the Fed will use further QE is a burden for
the dollar, whatever the volume they announce,"" said Ulrich
Leuchtmann, head of FX research at Commerzbank.
 More dollar-selling is unlikely before the announcement,
however, and the recent $1.37-1.41 euro/dollar range should
hold for now, he added.
 Analysts said the market remained fairly short dollars
heading into the Fed meeting but short-term players have
lightened some positions, latest CFTC data showed. [IMM/FX]
 Some analysts believe dollar short positions have become
overstretched as investors priced in aggressive Fed QE, leaving
scope for a pullback in the dollar if the Fed announces QE at
the lower end of expectations. Others, however, believe any QE
will be negative for the dollar.
 CENTRAL BANK MEETINGS, U.S. JOBS DATA
 There are also significant event risks this week, leaving
most investors sidelined, traders said. As well as the Fed,
there are four other major policy decisions this week -- in
Australia, the euro zone, UK and Japan -- with key U.S. jobs
data due Friday.
 In early morning trading, the greenback was down 0.3
percent against a basket of six currencies at 77.059 <.DXY>.
 Weaker-than-expected U.S. consumer spending and personal
income data had little impact on the currency market, but a
manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management
at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) should provide clues on how the U.S.
economy is faring ahead of the Fed meeting.
 The euro  was down slightly at $1.3933 after
climbing to $1.4012 overnight.
 The euro was weighed down by gains in the pound, traders
said, after UK data showing an above consensus PMI
manufacturing print. The recent strength in UK data, which
included a stronger-than-expected gross domestic product data
for the third quarter, has pushed out expectations the Bank of
England will engage in quantitative easing.
 The euro was down 0.3 percent at 0.8667 .
 The dollar gave up its gains against the yen and slid back
within sight of its 1995 record low of 79.75 yen, after spiking
more than one yen to 81.60 yen in early Asian trade. Talk of
dollar sales related to redemptions of U.S. Treasuries weighed
on the currency pair.
 The dollar was flat at 80.36 yen  after leaping
from 80.35 yen to 81.60 yen very rapidly at about 0000 GMT.
Before this, it had slipped to a 15-year low of 80.21.
 Dealers said the spike made many suspect possible Japanese
intervention, but it quickly gave up gains as talk circulated
the spike was caused by a miss-hit or technical glitch.
 With the dollar close to the 80.00 yen level some see as a
possible threshold for intervention, the sudden rise prompted
others to jump on the move, sending the dollar even higher.

 * Country has stockpile of about 4.5 million carats
 * Regulators to determine level of compliance
 
 (Repeats to add PIX tag in header field)
 By Steven Scheer
 JERUSALEM, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Zimbabwe plans to resume
selling diamonds from its controversial Marange fields within
days, saying it fully meets the standards required by the body
that regulates trade in conflict diamonds.
 Obert Moses Mpofu, Zimbabwe's minister of mines and mine
development, said a report that will be unveiled at this week's
Kimberley Process meeting in Israel shows the African country
should no longer be subject to industry sanctions.
 ""We have done everything in our power to meet the minimum
standards of the Kimberley Process certification scheme,"" Mpofu
told Reuters on the sidelines of the four-day meeting in
Jerusalem that began on Monday.
 ""This puts us in a position to resume exports without
sanctions. We will start selling diamonds again immediately
after the meeting,"" he said.
 Mpofu said Zimbabwe, in which 30 percent of the economy
comes from minerals, has a diamond stockpile of about 4.5
million carats that are due for export.
 ""We can't continue to hold them with no reason,"" he said.
 In June, Zimbabwe's government agreed that diamonds from
Marange would only be sold under the Kimberley Process -- a
certification scheme aimed at preventing the diamond trade from
financing violence.
 Marange became involved with the Kimberley Process after
30,000 illegal diggers descended on the fields in 2006,
prompting the government to deploy the army to stop rampant
panning and smuggling. 
 Rights groups accused the security forces of committing
atrocities during the crackdown.
 Zimbabwe has accused the West of a plot to stop it from
benefitting from diamonds but it received approval for two
shipments of diamonds in July. The Marange mine -- at 66,000
hectares (163,100 acres) considered the largest diamond find in
the last century -- is largely untapped, making its potential
huge.
 ""There is recognition that there have been marked
improvements in Marange,"" said Stephane Chardon, chairman of the
Kimberley Process working group on monitoring. ""But only some
parts are compliant and in other parts, less progess has been
made.""
 During this week's meeting, the main item on the agenda of
the some 75 countries participating will be Zimbabwe's
compliance with the Kimberley Process.
 Chardon told Reuters that Zimbabwe still needs further
action to curb illicit trade and smuggling of diamonds.
 He said that by the end of the meeting, the Kimberley
Process will issue conclusions on how much more of compliance,
if any, will be required from Marange.
 ""Do we still need closer monitoring or can they export
freely?"" Chardon said.
 Boaz Hirsch, chairman of the Kimberley Process, said there
is agreement that Zimbabwe has implemented its rules to a
certain extent but there were disputes as to whether the
implementation was 50 percent or 90 percent.
 In addition to Marange, Zimbabwe exports diamonds through a
domestic unit of global miner Rio Tinto.
 The Kimberley Process was formed eight years ago and
officials believe it has succeeded in virtually ending wars
financed by conflict diamonds.
 Another issue to be discussed at the meeting is how the
Kimberley Process can deal with human rights issues, a key
demand by its partner, Civil Society.

further to help its transition towards a consumption-based
economy, although there is no clear evidence the currency is
undervalued, a senior executive at Goldman Sachs said on Monday.
 Higher inflation in China had contributed to rises in the
yuan's real exchange rate, said Jim O'Neill, chairman of Goldman
Sachs asset management.
 ""To allow further modest appreciation may make some sense,""
he told reporters.
 It was not in China's own interest to keep accumulating
foreign exchange reserves, the world's largest stockpile at
$2.65 trillion at the end of September, he said.
 O'Neill said he suspected China would link the yuan's
appreciation to a target on its current account balance.
 Yi Gang, a central bank vice-governor, has said that China
is drafting a plan to limit its current account surplus to less
than 4 percent of GDP over the next three to five years.
 China's current account surplus is getting close to 4
percent and such a promise will help make Beijing's stance more
acceptable to other countries, particularly the United States,
O'Neill said.
 ""It seems to me that it would be quite a good idea for China
to agree to this idea of a 4 percent current account surplus
target,"" he said.
 At a G20 meeting in South Korea last month, the United
States proposed that countries set a target of capping either
their current account surplus or deficit at 4 percent of gross
domestic product. But there was no consensus on the U.S.
proposal.

 KAMPALA, April 1 (Reuters) - The path appears clear for
President Yoweri Museveni to lead Uganda through a fourth term
in office after planned opposition protests failed to
materialise.
 East Africa's third largest economy took a step closer to
becoming a significant oil producer in March. British oil
explorer Tullow Oil agreed to sell stakes in its Ugandan
operations to France's Total and China's CNOOC for $2.9 billion,
bringing in big partners to develop the oil fields. 
 Museveni, who won February's election with more than
two-thirds of the vote, was for years considered one of Africa's
standout leaders, astute on the economy and able to stabilise a
country with a long history of strife.
 He has come under increasing fire, however, for what critics
see as an authoritarian streak and mounting levels of
corruption.
 Those allegations of corruption will worry investors
watching the soon-to-be newest oil producer, set to start
producing and exporting during Museveni's new tenure.
 Here are some of the factors to watch:
 
 PROTEST THREAT GONE, NEW CABINET
 Opposition leader Kizza Besigye's calls for protests seem to
have fallen on deaf ears. The stage is now set for Museveni to
push forward with his programme for the next five years.
 Museveni, in power for 25 years, will appoint a cabinet in
April. Most analysts expect him to try to distribute seats
fairly among the country's ethnic groups and regions, though
some fear he may reward areas that supported him the most.
 If there is a perception that plum jobs have been awarded to
close allies and those from Museveni's home region, discontent
could simmer.
 What to watch:
 -- The cabinet reshuffle and the reaction to it.
 -- A proposal by a member of the ruling National Resistance
Movement to extend the presidential term to seven years from
five years. If parliament passes such an act, it will fuel
suspicions that Museveni wants to remain president for life,
worrying potential oil and gas investors.
 
 OIL DISPUTE RESOLVED?
 Tullow has agreed to sell each of Total and CNOOC a one
third interest in fields around Lake Albert, which Tullow
estimates to contain 1 billion barrels of oil, and potentially
as much as 3.5 billion barrels. Tullow will retain a third
share. 
 But the deal appears to leave a massive tax dispute with the
government unresolved.
 Uganda's Energy Minster Hilary Onek said the country would
receive a total of $472 million in taxes from the farmdown deal.
 Tullow, however, said this figure was calculated incorrectly
and that it believes the total liability to be ""significantly
less"" than the $141 million it has agreed to deposit with the
government pending discussions on the matter. 
 Tullow brought in Total and CNOOC to help develop the fields
in a $10 billion project. This will involve the construction of
a pipeline to the east African coast and other infrastructure.
 Tullow said it expected production of around 20,000 barrels
per day for the local market by 2015. Total said full scale
production could exceed 300,000 bpd. 
 With the Tullow's new partners onboard, Uganda's oil
industry is set to power forward, though worries persist over
potential corruption and the fact the deals Uganda struck with
oil firms remain secret.
 A leaked U.S. diplomatic dispatch revealed America's
Ambassador Jerry P. Lanier had proposed travel bans on certain
Ugandan cabinet ministers following allegations by Tullow the
politicians had taken bribes from Italian oil group Eni.
 What to watch:
 -- Closure on the tax spat. How much will Uganda get?
 -- Any impact from the windfall on Uganda's shilling? Most
traders doubt Uganda will use its new petrodollars to prop up a
currency the central bank considers undervalued. But will
government spending surge, strengthening the shilling and
possibly easing inflation concerns.
 -- Renewed allegations of corruption around oil industry.
 -- Uganda plans to open a new petroleum exploration
licensing round for blocks in its oil-rich Albertine Rift basin
in 2011. Investors will be watching how the tax dispute plays
out and any changes to legislation.
 -- Sustained post-election calm might help engineer a rally
in the shilling, helping to check a rising inflation rate in the
import-heavy economy.
 
 SECURITY THREAT
 Somalia's al Shabaab rebels have threatened more attacks on
Uganda after their twin suicide-bomb attack on Kampala in July
last year claimed 79 lives. The latest warning came on Dec. 23.
 Three days earlier, one person was killed in a grenade blast
on a Kampala-bound bus in Nairobi. Kenyan and Ugandan police
said the explosion may have been linked to al Shabaab's threats.
 On Dec. 10, Ugandan police, acting on intelligence, seized
suspected bomb making materials from another bus in Kampala.
 Al Shabaab has vowed to strike Uganda and nearby Burundi
until they withdraw their peacekeeping troops from Somalia's
capital, Mogadishu. The troops are all that stop insurgents from
toppling the weak Somali government, many experts say.
 Uganda tightened security in Kampala before the elections
and has had a number of intelligence successes against al
Shabaab.
 What to watch:
 -- More attacks by al Shabaab. Further strikes could deter
foreign investment inflows, send the shilling south, disrupt the
business tempo, hurt tourism and knock the economy.
 -- Continued foiling of al Shabaab plans by Ugandan security
forces may convince some that they are on top of the threat.

 LONDON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against a basket

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Robust economic data from China
and the nearing of Federal Reserve asset-buying combined to lift
emerging market stocks and weaken the dollar on Monday, with
Wall Street looking set to open higher.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> was up
a third of percent, mainly due to its emerging market component.
The emerging market benchmark <.MSCIEF> gained 1.2 percent.
 The dollar index <.DXY> -- which tracks the U.S. currency
against its major counterparts -- lost nearly 0.4 percent.
 On the data front, investors in risk were lifted by China's
factories ramping up their production last month, buoyed by an
influx of new business.
 This highlighted the strength of the world's second-largest
economy -- driving funds into emerging markets and stocks
exposed to Chinese growth -- but also pointed to price
pressures. [ID:nTOE6A001P]
 Equities were also generally lifted by the prospect of more
quantitative easing from the Fed on Wednesday. There is little
question in investors' minds that the U.S. central bank will
act, but there are worries about how much. [ID:nLDE69S0EN]
 The risk is that what the Fed ends up doing will not justify
the huge investment plays that have already been put in place in
the run up to the meeting.
 ""The China data was good. You want demand strong. It's the
demand rather than the dollar you'd be worrying about,"" said
Philip Isherwood, European equities strategist at Evolution
Securities. ""The market is expecting QE, whether it is a large
dollop or in smaller amounts.""
 European stocks, however, failed to hang on to early gains.
The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was flat. Japan's Nikkei <.N225>
lost half a percent, mainly because of yen strength against the
dollar.
 QE HITS DOLLAR
 The dollar came under pressure against most other major
currencies as the market geared up for the Fed's meeting. QE
essentially means printing more dollars, undermining their
value.
 ""The fact that the Fed will use further QE is a burden for
the dollar, whatever the volume they announce,"" said Ulrich

 A recent Reuters poll found most leading economists expect
the Fed to buy between $80 billion and $100 billion in assets
per month, but totals range widely, from $250 billion to as high

 The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.3965  while the
dollar was flat against the yen  at 80.42 yen.

 The dollar was close to flat at 80.38 yen after leaping from
80.35 yen to 81.60 yen very rapidly at about 0000 GMT. It had
earlier slid to a 15-year low of 80.21.
 Dealers said the spike came as dollar/yen jumped straight
from about 80.40 yen to 80.70 yen on trading platform EBS,
making many suspect possible Japanese intervention.
 With the dollar trending ever closer to the 80.00 yen level
that some see as a possible threshold for intervention, the
sudden rise prompted others to jump on the move, sending the
dollar even higher.
 But it quickly gave up its gains as talk circulated that the
spike was caused by a miss-hit or technical glitch. A Japanese
Ministry of Finance official declined to comment on the sudden
move.
 Japan intervened to sell yen for the first time since 2004
on Sept. 15, intervening repeatedly through the Asian, European
and U.S. trading day to drive the dollar up from a 15-year low.
 But Japanese authorities did not conduct any foreign
exchange intervention between Sept. 29 and Oct. 27, the Ministry
of Finance said on Friday. 
 While players remain on guard against possible intervention,
many traders think such steps are unlikely.
 Yunosuke Ikeda, senior FX strategist at Nomura Securities,
said the likelihood of intervention was fairly low in particular
after the G20 meetings, where countries agreed to shun
competitive currency devaluations.
 ""As long as the dollar/yen's fall is mainly attributable to
the weakness of the U.S. dollar, any justification of unilateral
Japanese intervention will be very difficult,"" he said.
 The greenback dropped 0.4 percent against a basket of six

(Adds CFO comments, updates shares)
 By Greg Roumeliotis
 AMSTERDAM, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Third-quarter operating profit
at Dutch logistics group TNT NV fell by a fifth despite higher
revenues, missing expectations, as the margin at its troubled
mail unit deteriorated. 
 TNT shares hit a 12-month low and were trading down 3.4
percent at 18.445 euros at 1145 GMT, the worst performers in
Amsterdam's blue-chip index, which was up 0.5 percent.
 TNT was complying with security steps after two parcel bombs
on U.S.-bound planes were intercepted last week, its finance
chief said, but he would not comment on costs to arise from new
measures governments may take.
 ""We have restricted activities with regards to Yemen. We are
sticking to all safety restrictions and the embargo,"" CFO
Bernard Bot told a conference call with reporters. 
 ""The question is what the governments will be doing now and
then we'll also be on board, but I cannot be more specific than
that.""
 TNT, which is separating its express and mail units and
preparing the mail business for a possible sale, said cost
savings in mail were insufficient to offset volume declines,
price pressures and a rise in pension and other costs.
 ""The results were surprisingly bad in mail, which was going
down (steadily) in terms of volumes. The operating result is way
below consensus. In express, we expected higher operating income
on such volumes,"" said Rabobank analyst Philip Scholte.
 Faced with the rise of electronic communications and
declining postal volumes, TNT has been trying to restructure its
mail unit. Trade unions have threatened to strike over
redundancies as TNT seeks to axe 11,000 jobs.
 ""This is the first year where we have full liberalisation in
mail. But one quarter of the decline (in addressed mail volumes)
is due to competition and three quarters are due to (electronic
communication) substitution effects,"" Bot said.
 TNT said it was on track for an internal separation of mail
and express by Jan. 1 and that the preferred capital markets
transaction to separate the equity of mail and express was in
the process of final evaluation. Bot said the capital markets
operation could be delayed if there was no union agreement.
 Banking sources told Reuters on Friday that TNT was
considering a capital increase and had asked banks to put
forward proposals. The company plans to provide more details on
the separation at its analyst day on Dec. 2.
 It posted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 143
million euros ($199.8 million) on revenues up 11.4 percent
year-on-year to 2.766 billion. Analysts in a Reuters poll had
projected EBIT of 169 million on revenues of 2.673 billion.
 
 GOOD BUT NOT GREAT
 ""Business conditions in Q3 have generally followed the
trends we experienced in the first half of the year -- good but
not great -- with a continuation of the general recovery of
activity levels held back by a difficult pricing environment,""
Chief Executive Peter Bakker said in a statement.
 Air freight traffic -- a bellwether for global trade and
economic activity -- lagged expectations in September, with
volumes 6 percent below May's post-crisis peak.
 In October, UPS, the world's largest package delivery
company, beat quarterly profit forecasts and raised its
full-year outlook, saying it expected modest holiday season
growth in a slowly recovering U.S. economy.
 TNT said traffic in express, which accounted for 54.5
percent of operating profit in the third quarter, rose both in
terms of kilos carried and the number of consignments but that
the yield in the division continued to be negative.
 TNT has taken measures to improve profitability in express,
such as increasing prices in Europe by an average 3.5 percent,
but has warned the full effect would not be felt until 2011.
 TNT trades at 11.2 times 12-month forward earnings, at a
discount to UPS and FedEx, which trade at over 15 times, but a
premium to Deutsche Post, which trades at 10.7 times, according
to Thomson Reuters StarMine.

 BEIJING, Nov 1 (Reuters) - An intensifying ""currency war""
will cast a shadow over the global economy next year, but it is
unlikely to escalate into a full-blown trade war, China's
commerce ministry said on Monday.
 The ministry said China would try to play its part to balance
global trade flows by boosting imports of advanced technology and
resources. The country's yawning trade surplus is a key source of
international tension, with critics accusing Beijing of keeping
its currency undervalued to support its exporters.
 ""The currency war is intensifying,"" the ministry said in a
report published on its website (www.mofcom.gov.cn). ""In the
mid-term, the U.S. dollar will continue to weaken and gaming
between major currencies will escalate, increasing risks for
businesses and affecting global trade development.""
 But it said tensions would be held in check while nations
look to increase exports to boost their economies and global
bodies such as the World Trade Organisation contain disputes.
 ""Generally speaking, there is no one country that is willing
to or will dare to stoke trade conflicts,"" it added.
 The ministry also pledged to maintain its current policy
stance to achieve the goal of stabilising exports while expanding
imports next year.
 The total volume of exports and imports this year was
expected to reach $2.8 trillion, up about 25 percent from a year
earlier, it said.

 By Hideyuki Sano and Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against a basket of
currencies on Monday and, after a brief spike against the yen on
intervention speculation, quickly lost height there as well as
talk circulated the jump had been caused by a miss-hit or
technical glitch.
 The greenback came under pressure against most other major
currencies, with the euro testing resistance at $1.4000, as the
market gears up for the Federal Reserve to step up money printing
after its policy meeting on Nov. 2-3.
 After spiking more than 1 yen to 81.60 yen in early Asian
trade, the dollar gave up its gains and slid back within range of
its 1995 record low of 79.75 yen, with talk of dollar sales
related to redemptions of U.S. Treasuries weighing it down.
 Analysts say the market remains fairly short dollars as it
heads into the Fed meeting but short-term players who have
lightened positions recently have room for moving intra-day.
 ""The market doesn't want to take a big position but if
there's a move, for example on some certain information about QE,
then the market may follow,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX
strategist Japan at Barclays Capital.
 The dollar was flat at 80.38 yen after leaping from 80.35
yen to 81.60 yen very rapidly at about 0000 GMT.
 Dealers said the spike came as the dollar/yen price jumped
straight from about 80.40 yen to 80.70 yen on trading platform
EBS, making many suspect possible intervention by Japanese
authorities, who intervened for the first time in more than six
years in September.
 With the dollar trending ever closer to the 80.00 yen level
that some see as a possible threshold for intervention, the
sudden rise prompted others to jump on the move, sending the
dollar even higher.
 But it quickly gave up its gains as talk circulated that the
spike was caused by a miss-hit or technical glitch, while a
Japanese Ministry of Finance official declined to comment on the
sudden move.
 ""I think there was (dollar) buying by people who thought
there was intervention,"" said a trader for a major Japanese bank.
 But he said: ""Judging from the price action (after that), the
market probably doesn't think right now that there has been any
intervention.""
 Japan intervened to sell yen for the first time since 2004 on
Sept. 15, intervening repeatedly through the Asian, European and
U.S. trading day to drive the dollar up from a 15-year low.
 But most traders think Tokyo has refrained from intervention
since then even as Japanese policymakers continue to warn of
""decisive actions"" on currencies if needed.
 While players remain on guard against possible intervention,
many traders think such steps are unlikely.
 Yunosuke Ikeda, senior FX strategist at Nomura Securities,
said the likelihood of intervention is fairly low in particular
after the G20 meetings, where countries agreed to shun
competitive currency devaluations.
 ""As long as the dollar/yen's fall is mainly attributable to
the weakness of the U.S. dollar, any justification of unilateral
Japanese intervention will be very difficult,"" he said.
 Unless dollar/yen falls decisively below 80.00 yen and the
yen is appreciating against all other currencies, intervention is
unlikely, Ikeda added.
 EURO, AUSSIE RISE
 The greenback dropped 0.6 percent against a basket of six
currencies. The dollar index, now at 76.83, has major support at
76.67-70, which is its Oct. 25 low as well as the 76.4 percent
retracement of its rebound in mid-October.
 The euro climbed 0.4 percent to $1.3998. Resistance lies in a
band from $1.4000 to about $1.4018, which is the upper limit of a
corrective triangle by Elliot Wave analysis in which the first
leg is the fall from $1.4161 on Oct. 15 to the Oct. 20 $1.3697
low.
 Failure at $1.4018 could open the way to a move down to
$1.3750, the lower boundary of the triangle.
 The Australian dollar rose 0.6 percent to $0.9894 after
China's official purchasing managers' index for manufacturing
beat market expectations and hit a six-month high.
 Chinese data helped to lift regional currencies and shares.
 ""It's a bit like the tail is wagging the dog but recently
we've seen the strength in Asian currencies often precedes the
dollar's decline against other majors. Today's is one of those
days,"" said Koichi Yoshikawa, head of FX trading at BNP Paribas
in Tokyo.
 The dollar is also broadly under pressure after U.S. Treasury
yields dropped on Friday, ahead of the Fed's policy meeting. The
yield on U.S. two-year notes fell near a record low.
 A recent Reuters poll found that most leading economists
expect the Fed to buy between $80 billion and $100 billion in
assets per month, with totals ranging widely, from $250 billion
to as high as $2 trillion.

 * Not considering changing HKD-USD peg - HKMA
 * Peg contributing to growing asset bubbles - analysts
 By Saikat Chatterjee and Lee Chyen Yee
 HONG KONG, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Hong Kong will see more
issuances of yuan-denominated corporate bonds this year, its
central bank said, after China loosened the reins on the use of
its currency in trade and investment in the territory.
 Yuan-denominated bond issuances this year were forecast to
reach 17.8 billion yuan ($2.67 billion), Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) Chief Executive Norman Chan told legislators on
Monday.
 Yuan bond sales in Hong Kong have been intermittent since
China sanctioned them in 2007, but have picked up pace since a
landmark announcement in July.
 China removed restrictions on business loans in yuan,
permitted companies and individuals globally to open yuan
accounts, and allowed for the sale of yuan-denominated financial
products. [ID:nTOE69R07Y]
 Multinationals including McDonald's Corp  and Hopewell
Highway Infrastructure Ltd <0737.HK> sold bonds in August and
supranationals such as the International Finance Corp have plans
to do so in coming weeks.
 ""The renminbi business in Hong Kong is developing rapidly. We
are very concerned about this development. Many bond issuers have
come to Hong Kong to issue renminbi bonds and the amount has been
increasing,"" Chan said.
 HKD PEG TO STAY
 At an HKMA briefing to the legislative council, Chan also
said Hong Kong remained committed to the Hong Kong dollar's peg
to the U.S. dollar, amid market speculation that the rising pace
of yuan deposits in the territory may encourage them to abandon
the 27-year old peg in favour of the Chinese currency.
 September data showed yuan deposits grew 15 percent from a
month earlier to 149.3 billion yuan. It has more than doubled
since the end of 2009 and Goldman Sachs said it expected total
yuan deposits to grow to 3-5 trillion yuan in the next 3-5 years.
 Hong Kong faces increasing inflationary pressures as the peg
would mean interest rates remain near record lows following
near-zero interest rates in the United States, prompting
borrowers to raise cheap funds to buy property and other assets,
and raising concerns of a buildup in asset price bubbles.
 While low mortgage rates have led apartment buyers to snap up
property, analysts said a switch to a peg of the Chinese yuan was
not feasible for now its currency was not fully convertible.
 ""We have to wait for the Chinese yuan to become fully
convertible, so for now the HKMA will have to bear any negative
impact from the peg,"" said Frances Cheung, an analyst at Credit
Agricole in Hong Kong.
 ""For asset price bubbles, the HKMA may choose to use other
tools such as tightening credit,"" she said.

commerce official said on Monday, adding to Beijing's efforts to
soothe foreign companies and governments worried about supply.
 A Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce, Chen Jian, made the

jitters about whether China could use its hold on 97 percent of
global rare earths production to sharply curtail exports of the

 Chen's comment came after Vietnam and Japan, a major consumer
of rare earths from China, agreed at an Asian regional meeting in
Hanoi on Sunday to partner on mining the minerals in Vietnam.
[ID:nSGE69U00S]
 Japan and other countries, including the United States, have
said they are seeking to diversify their access to rare earth
supplies away from China, following indications that Chinese
exports have been disrupted or blocked.
 Beijing has repeatedly said it is within its rights to
control exports and its foreign customers should not be alarmed.
 ""I don't think there will be a big cut in export quotas,""
Chen said, when asked whether China would slash rare earth
exports next year.
 ""China has a management system, but China has no embargoes"",
he said. ""But that does not mean you can buy freely, there will
be a quota system -- the quota system is a way of management.""

 TOKYO, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The dollar jumped against the yen on
Monday in a market wary of Japanese intervention but quickly gave
up its gains as traders cited talk that there might have been a
miss-hit or technical glitch rather than intervention.
 The greenback came under pressure against most other major
currencies as the market gears up for the Federal Reserve to step
up money printing after its policy meeting on Nov. 2-3.
 The dollar rose more than 1 percent to as high as 81.60 yen
after hitting a fresh 15-year low of 80.21 yen in early Monday
trade. But the currency pared much of its gains to trade around
80.70 yen, up 0.4 percent on the day.
 A Japanese Ministry of Finance official declined to comment
on the sudden move in dollar/yen.
 ""Everybody was nervous. There's been lots of conflicting
information,"" said a trader at a European bank.
 Traders said the market was becoming cautious about
intervention as dollar/yen came within a whisker of its post-war
record low of 79.75 yen.
 Traders said there was also talk in the market of a miss-hit
or technical problem as the dollar jumped to 80.70 yen from 80.40
yen around 0000 GMT, which initially led traders to believe that
Japanese authorities had intervened.
 ""I think there was (dollar) buying by people who thought

 SYDNEY, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Asian shares rose the most in
seven weeks on Monday, driven higher by surprisingly strong
China manufacturing data and hopes that super-easy U.S.
monetary policy will loosen even further this week.
Investor demand for riskier assets was palpable across
markets. Government bonds fell, commodity prices and currencies
rose, and the U.S. dollar plumbed a 15-year low against the
yen.
 Europe's stock markets picked up Asia's baton. The
FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> rose 0.5 percent in opening deals,
while the main indexes in Britain, Germany and France gained
0.5 percent to 0.8 percent. <.FTSE> <.FCHI> <.GDAXI>
 A spike in the U.S. dollar against the yen in early Asian
trade stirred speculation that Tokyo had intervened to sell the
yen. But the currency's rise was brief, so traders quickly
suspected the spike was caused by a trading glitch. [USD/]
 Still, investors were nervous that Japanese authorities
might intervene soon given that the dollar was changing hands
at 80.45 yen, within spitting distance of its post-war record
low of 79.75 .
 Surveys pointing to healthy manufacturing expansion in both
China and India prompted the MSCI index of Asian shares outside
Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> to rally 1.7 percent by early afternoon
Asia time, its biggest gain in any single day since September
13.
 China's manufacturing growth hit a six-month high in
October, purchasing managers' indexes showed, suggesting the
world's second-biggest economy was powering ahead even as the
United States and most of Europe languished.
 Investors expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to give the U.S.
economy a shot in the arm on Wednesday with an injection of
cash, a policy known as quantitative easing. Many expect the
Fed to offer to buy $500 billion of Treasury debt over five
months.
 ""Quantitative easing is what the market's focused on.
That'll lift all boats,"" said James Holt, a Sydney-based
investment specialist at BlackRock, the world's biggest fund
manager.
  [ID:nTOE6A0044]

 The Fed risk encouraged investors to sell the U.S. dollar
and buy commodities, in part on the belief the move will fuel
growth.
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY> was under pressure at 76.838.
A break below its Oct 25 low of 76.709 could herald more
losses, analysts say.
 The prospect of more dollar weakness made dollar-based
commodities attractive. Spot silver  jumped to 30-year
peaks, palladium  to nine-year highs, gold hit a two-week
high [GOL/] and oil rose towards $82 a barrel [O/R].
 ""Sentiment is cautiously bullish before the Fed meeting,""
said a gold dealer in Hong Kong. ""People are still talking
about the price target of $1,400.""
 Commodity currencies joined the rally, led by the
Australian  and New Zealand dollars .
 The preference for risk saw buying demand in U.S. and
Japanese government bonds taper off. [US/] [JP/]
 Still, the performance in U.S. Treasuries is by no means
dismal this year, with U.S. two-year yields  near a
record low.
 LANGUID JAPAN
 For all the economic growth in Asia, Japan is bucking the
trend. Asia's second-largest economy is struggling with
deflation and growth is elusive.
 A 13 percent rally in the yen this year against the dollar
has weighed on the exports sector, a major driving force behind
the economy.
 The economic woes underlined a 0.5 percent fall in the
Nikkei average <.N225> on Monday. For the year, it is Asia's
worse performing stock market, having fallen 13 percent
compared with an 11 percent rise in the MSCI ex-Japan index.
 Starmine data shows Japanese stocks trade at a forward
price-to-earnings ratio of 6.9 times, the lowest in Asia, and
less than half of the 15 times in China and Indonesia.
 To be sure, Japan is not alone. For the year, data from
EPFR Global showed investors have pulled cash from European,
Japanese and U.S. share markets, with the U.S. market worst
hit. Emerging markets, on the other hand, have pulled in over
$60 billion worth of funds.

yen. But the currency's rise was brief, so traders quickly
suspected the spike was caused by a trading glitch.
 Still, investors were nervous that Japanese authorities
might intervene soon given that the dollar was changing hands
at 80.45 yen, within spitting distance of its post-war record
low of 79.75.
 Surveys pointing to healthy manufacturing expansion in both
China and India prompted the MSCI index of Asian shares outside
Japan to rally 1.7 percent by early afternoon Asia time, its
biggest gain in any single day since September 13.
 China's manufacturing growth hit a six-month high in
October, purchasing managers' indexes showed, suggesting the
world's second-biggest economy was powering ahead even as the
United States and most of Europe languished.
 Investors expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to give the U.S.
economy a shot in the arm on Wednesday with an injection of
cash, a policy known as quantitative easing. Many expect the
Fed to offer to buy $500 billion of Treasury debt over five
months.
 ""Quantitative easing is what the market's focused on.
That'll lift all boats,"" said James Holt, a Sydney-based
investment specialist at BlackRock, the world's biggest fund
manager.
 The Fed risk encouraged investors to sell the U.S. dollar
and buy commodities, in part on the belief the move will fuel
growth.
 The U.S. dollar index was under pressure at 76.838. A break
below its Oct 25 low of 76.709 could herald more losses,
analysts say.
 The prospect of more dollar weakness made dollar-based
commodities attractive. Spot silver jumped to 30-year peaks,
palladium to nine-year highs, gold hit a two-week high and oil
rose towards $82 a barrel.
 ""Sentiment is cautiously bullish before the Fed meeting,""
said a gold dealer in Hong Kong. ""People are still talking
about the price target of $1,400.""
 Commodity currencies joined the rally, led by the
Australian and New Zealand dollars.
 The preference for risk saw buying demand in U.S. and
Japanese government bonds taper off.
 Still, the performance in U.S. Treasuries is by no means
dismal this year, with U.S. two-year yields near a record low.
 LANGUID JAPAN
 For all the economic growth in Asia, Japan is bucking the
trend. Asia's second-largest economy is struggling with
deflation and growth is elusive.
 A 13 percent rally in the yen this year against the dollar
has weighed on the exports sector, a major driving force behind
the economy.
 The economic woes underlined a 0.5 percent fall in the
Nikkei average on Monday. For the year, it is Asia's worse
performing stock market, having fallen 13 percent compared with
an 11 percent rise in the MSCI ex-Japan index.
 Starmine data shows Japanese stocks trade at a forward
price-to-earnings ratio of 6.9 times, the lowest in Asia, and
less than half of the 15 times in China and Indonesia.
 To be sure, Japan is not alone. For the year, data from
EPFR Global showed investors have pulled cash from European,
Japanese and U.S. share markets, with the U.S. market worst
hit. Emerging markets, on the other hand, have pulled in over
$60 billion worth of funds.

 TOKYO, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The dollar jumped against the yen on
Monday in a market wary of Japanese intervention but quickly gave
up its gains as traders cited talk that there might have been a
miss-hit or technical glitch rather than intervention.
 The dollar rose more than 1 percent to as high as 81.60 yen
after hitting a fresh 15-year low of 80.21 yen in early Monday
trade. But the currency pared much of the gains to trade around
80.60 yen, up 0.3 percent on the day.
 A Japanese Ministry of Finance official declined to comment
on the sudden move in dollar/yen.
 ""Everybody was nervous. There's been lots of conflicting
information,"" said a trader at a European bank.
 Traders said the market was becoming cautious about
intervention as the dollar/yen came within a whisker of its
post-war record low of 79.75 yen.
 Traders said there was also talk in the market of a miss-hit
or technical problem as the dollar jumped to 80.70 yen from 80.40
yen around 0000 GMT, which initially led traders to believe that
Japanese authorities had intervened.
 ""I think there was (dollar) buying by people who thought
there was intervention,"" said a trader for a major Japanese bank.
 But he said: ""Judging from the price action (after that), the
market probably doesn't think right now that there had been any
intervention.""
 Japanese authorities intervened to sell yen for the first
time since 2004 on Sept. 15, intervening repeatedly through the
Asian, European and U.S. trading day to drive the dollar up from
a 15-year low.
 But most traders think Tokyo has refrained from intervention
since then even as Japanese policymakers continue to warn of
""decisive actions"" on currencies if needed.
 The euro was little changed at $1.3953.
 The dollar is broadly under pressure after U.S. Treasury
yields dropped on Friday, with the two-year yielding falling near
a record low ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting
this week.

 * Shippers worried about pressure for 100 percent scanning
 * Global logistics costs expected to rise 
 
 By Tim Hepher
 PARIS, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Security fears triggered by the
air freight bomb plot could increase the costs of global trade
and fuel debate over the technology needed to screen packages
and who should pay for it, transport officials said on Sunday.
 Two air packages containing bombs -- both sent from Yemen
and addressed to synagogues in Chicago -- were intercepted in
Britain and Dubai on Friday.
 One of the packages was found on a United Parcel Service
cargo plane at East Midlands Airport, north of London. The
other was discovered in a computer printer cartridge in a parcel
at a FedEx facility in Dubai.
 The plot could speed up calls for wider use of sophisticated
imaging technology designed to detect explosives, which is not
standard, but freight firms are reluctant to bear the full cost.
 ""The technology used for screening of cargo, typically by
X-ray, ... doesn't have explosive detection capacity, but it
does enable them to find most things,"" said Norman Shanks, a
former head of security at the British airports operator BAA.
 ""But cleverly concealed devices like this might suggest that
there will have to be an ability for an explosive detection
capacity such as CT (computed tomography),"" said Shanks, who now
works as a specialist aviation security consultant.
 Tomography is a medical scanning technology designed to
display sectional images. Its attraction for security firms was
highlighted when France's Safran paid $580 million a year ago
for 81 percent of GE Homeland Protection, which supplies the
technology.
 British Home Secretary (interior minister) Theresa May said
security around air cargo arriving in Britain was being
reviewed, but stopped short of saying a tighter system was being
planned.
 Marco Sorgetti, director-general of CLECAT, a European
association of freight-forwarding companies, said there were
fears of a knee-jerk reaction to the security scare.
 ""Although this is a clear example where targeted
investigation pays, some will say this is why we need 100
percent scanning. What happened doesn't make it (100 percent
scanning) one inch better in terms of risk analysis, but
emotionally people will say we have to do this.""
 Freight firms clashed with U.S. and European policymakers
last year over calls for 100 percent scanning of sea containers.
Plans to introduce full scanning from 2012 were postponed.
 Shippers say targeted intelligence work is more effective
than faith in a blanket technological approach with no guarantee
of success, given the minute quantities needed to pose a threat.
They say the intelligence tip-offs linked to Friday's discovery
demonstrate that existing systems work.
 But some analysts say the cargo industry has for long enough
escaped the stringent attention given to passenger security, or
freight carried in the cargo holds of passenger airliners.
 ""Although there has been a lot of talk about the air cargo
security regulations, most of these regulations affect the cargo
that is placed on commercial passenger aircraft, not all-cargo
operators,"" said Jeff Price, lead author of ""Practical Aviation
Security: Predicting and Preventing Future Threats"".
 
 TWO-TIER SYSTEM
 The World Customs Organization distinguishes between
screening -- risk assessment based on the origin and other
information; scanning -- which involves X-ray or gamma-ray
machines scanning closed packages; and full physical inspection.
 Shanks said introducing full scanning globally would be
unaffordable -- but authorities may toughen a two-tier approach:
 ""I think it will have to be affordable for packages of cargo
coming out of countries that are known in the past to have
caused problems. This will have to be a cost that is either
picked up by the state itself or added onto the shipment.""
 FedEx and UPS, respectively the world's largest and second
largest carriers of air freight by volume, are just the tip of a
multi-billion-dollar logistics industry responsible for keeping
global supply chains running smoothly.
 ""In the past five or six years we saw logistics costs go up
due to the movement of production plants to other areas in the
world. A big security focus might put the costs up further,""
said Nicole Geerkens, top executive at the European Logistics
Association.
 ""Now there is a trend where people are considering whether
to in-source,"" or repatriate production, she added.
 Analysts say logistics represent up to 15 percent of the
value of goods, depending on the type of business and economy.
 ""Depending on how you look at it, logistics probably cover
about 10 percent of everyone's lifestyle,"" Sorgetti said.
 The plot puts worldwide attention on security just as cargo
companies struggle to maintain a recovery in air shipments seen
over the past year.
 Any lasting economic damage may be felt more widely.
 ""It's our response that achieves the true outcomes of the
attack, not the attack itself,"" said Price.
 ""Recall the after-effects of 9/11. Economic recession,
airline bailouts, the largest governmental bureaucracy created
since World War Two. We now spend billions of dollars a year on
homeland security, and the attacks have forever changed the way
in which we travel.""

1010,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2010 01:08PM ET</span>",Qatar Airways urges more access to Canadian market," By Regan E. Doherty
 DOHA, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Qatar Airways' chief executive
called on Sunday for greater access for the fast expanding Gulf
carrier to the Canadian market, saying the development of
bilateral trade ties may depend on it.
 ""We have Canadian companies trying to sell us equipment. But
trade is a two-way street. We will give them trade, in return we
want to access their markets,"" Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker
told a conference in the capital, Doha.
 The rapid expansion of Qatar Airways, Dubai's Emirates, and
Etihad of Abu Dhabi has unnerved older airlines and fuelled
mutual accusations of protectionism. Many carriers fear
Gulf-based superjumbos will drain their own hubs.
 Canada's military lost access this month to a military camp
near Dubai, which it used to support troops in Afghanistan,
after Ottawa refused to allow Emirates and Etihad to increase
flights to Canada.
 ""They just want to throw peanuts at us. But the genie is out
of the bottle. They will not be able to restrain our capacity,""
Baker said.
On Saturday, Qatar Airways confirmed that it had carried an
explosive package that was later seized in Dubai. The parcel had
been flown from Yemen with a stop-over in the Qatari capital
Doha, it said.
 Without referring to the security scare over the explosive
packages bound for the United States, Baker said security was a
problem for all airlines .
 ""It is everybody's problem, because we are all in the same
boat. But we are overreacting sometimes by putting passengers
through excessive inconvenience,"" he said, citing the removal of
belts, flat shoes and laptop computers as excessive.
 Baker said he was less than impressed with security on
internal U.S. flights recently.
 ""Quite frankly, I found it very lax. But you cannot make
anything 100 percent. No matter how many checks you do, there
will still be cracks. The only way to fill the cracks is to
invest in technology.""
 Baker said he expected more consolidation in the industry.
 ""There has been over the last 40 years a fashion to launch
airlines. Then the recession came, and some folded. We are
expecting more to fold. So there will be automatic and natural
consolidation, without having to spend money on this,"" he said.
 ""Air France, Lufthansa-- they all want to protect their
turf. But they do not have the capacity to grow. They are trying
to blame us for their shortcomings. Instead they should fix
their own inefficiencies.""
 Qatar, the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural
gas, is building a new airport with the capacity to accommodate
50 million passengers per year.
 Construction on the New Doha International Airport (NDIA)
will be partially completed by October of next year, with total
completion slated for February 2012, Bernardo Gogna, director of
the NDIA, said at the conference.
 Air Canada's chief executive this year accused Emirates of
wanting to ""flood"" Canadian skies with airline seats so it can
scoop up travellers and divert them through Dubai.

 * UK says Merkel, Cameron agree need for EU to curb spending

(Adds details, background)
 By Adrian Croft
 LONDON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Britain, Germany, Indonesia and
Turkey are setting up an experts' group to suggest ways to boost
global trade, Britain and Germany said on Sunday.
 The group's creation, announced after talks between British
Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela
Merkel, comes at a time when some economists fear that currency
strains could escalate into trade wars.
 The experts have been asked to make recommendations in early
2011 on boosting global trade in the short and medium term by
tackling tariff, regulatory, administrative and physical
barriers to trade.
 ""Trade is the engine of global growth. That is why we have
put boosting trade and tackling trade barriers high on our
governments' agendas and want to see a strong political
commitment to liberalising trade at the Seoul G20 summit,""
Cameron and Merkel said in a statement.
 Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies meet in Seoul on
Nov 11-12.
 The experts' group will be led by Peter Sutherland, a former
head of the World Trade Organisation, and Jagdish Bhagwati, a
trade expert and professor at New York's Columbia University.
 It will include experts from advanced, emerging and
developing economies, including G20 members Germany, Britain,
Indonesia and Turkey, which are co-sponsoring the group.
 The EU has set a goal of completing the Doha round of global
trade talks in 2011, according to a draft document obtained by
Reuters this month.
 
 SUPPORT FOR OPEN MARKETS
 Cameron and Merkel underlined that open markets and free
trade should be at the heart of the global economic recovery,
according to Cameron's spokesman.
 G20 finance ministers agreed this month to shun competitive
currency devaluations but stopped short of setting targets to
reduce trade imbalances that cloud global growth prospects.
 In talks at the British prime minister's residence at
Chequers outside London, Cameron updated Merkel on the probe
into package bombs from Yemen intercepted in Dubai and Britain.
 Germany's federal crime office said it had tipped British
authorities about the parcel bomb found in Britain. Merkel and
Cameron agreed to maintain close counter-terrorism cooperation.
 The two leaders also agreed on the need for restraint in
European Union spending, Cameron's spokesman said.
 ""The 2011 EU budget should increase by no more than 2.9
percent and the EU budget in future years should reflect the
spending cuts that national governments were having to make,""
the spokesman said, summarising the leaders' discussion.
 Cameron claimed a victory last week when he won support from
France, Germany and others at a European Union summit to limit
the rise in next year's EU budget to 2.9 percent, lower than the
5.9 percent increase backed by the European Parliament.
 But more important from the British government's point of
view is to build alliances with other EU states to fight an
increase in the EU's long-term budget.
 Britain, slashing spending at home to rein in a record
peacetime budget deficit, wants a cut in the EU's long-term
spending for 2014-2020, on which talks are just beginning.
 Merkel and Cameron also called on Iran to return to
negotiations on its nuclear programme, Cameron's spokesman said.

 * Banking sector quite strong with high capital

(Releads, adds more comments)
 By Eman Goma
 KUWAIT, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Turkey's central bank has to
brake credit growth after the country's economy recovered
rapidly from the global crisis, and new policy tools may be
needed, Deputy Governor Erdem Basci said on Sunday.
 ""We have to use instruments to slow down (credit) growth,""
Basci told a financial conference in Kuwait on Sunday.
 Last month, Turkey raised its reserve requirement rate for
banks, removing around $3 billion of spare cash from the economy
as part of a withdrawal of extra stimulus pumped in during the
financial crisis.
 When asked by Reuters what policy tools the central bank
could be using, he said: ""We have to have some new instruments
if needed (to slow down lending).""
 ""Now with our exit strategy, we are coming back to
pre-Lehman levels. But now we have taken an extra step... We are
not paying interest on required cash reserves.""
 He did not provide more details.
 Total bank loans increased 26 percent in August from the
same period a year earlier. The rate of loan growth is seen
easing as the pace of Turkish economic growth slows.
 Basci also said the country's banking system was quite
strong and highly capitalised.
 ""Banks have strong capital. They are liquid and there is
demand for credit as well,"" he said.
 The central bank said on Oct. 26 its base scenario was that
interest rates would remain at their current levels until late
2011, when it expects a modest hike. It said it expected rates
to remain in the single digits.
 The central bank left its policy rate unchanged at 7 percent
on Oct. 14 as expected, but cut its overnight borrowing rate by
a surprisingly large 50 basis points.

(Adds Bahrain, Qatar central bank comments, background)
 KUWAIT, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Bahrain's central bank is
concerned about volatility in global currency markets as well as
rising food costs, its governor said on Sunday.
 Meanwhile Qatar's economy will expand strongly this year,
the head of its central bank said.
 ""I am concerned on the global side, there is a lot of
uncertainty. There is a great deal of volatility in the market
which caused certain anxiety within markets,"" Bahrain Central
Bank Governor Rasheed al-Maraj told Reuters.
 ""The fluctuation in currencies from time to time is a
reflection of the global economy and we have to recognise and
take into consideration these movements, but it will not
influence our decisions in the short term,"" he said.
 The uncertainty surrounding a fresh round of U.S. monetary
easing weighed on the dollar on Friday, pushing it just shy of a
15-year low against the Japanese yen.
The island kingdom pegs its dinar currency to the dollar --
as do most of its fellow Gulf Arab crude producers -- which
keeps its monetary policy closely aligned to that of the United
States.
 Maraj also said an increase in global food prices was
another source of worry.
 ""I do not think inflation is a problem for us. The increase
in food prices globally is a concern as it transpires into
higher prices on the local market,"" he said on the sidelines of
a financial conference in Kuwait.
 Inflation in the small non-OPEC oil producer slowed to a
six-month low of 2.0 percent on an annual basis in September,
but rose 0.7 percent month-on-month, the fastest rate in a year
as food prices soared.
 Separately, Qatar's central bank expects the economy of the
world's largest liquefied natural gas exporter to perform
strongly this year, its governor told the same conference.
 ""According to our expectations ... growth in GDP this year
is going to be 16 percent,"" Sheikh Abdullah bin Saud al-Thani
said.
 Analysts polled by Reuters expected Qatar's gross domestic
product to jump 15.5 percent this year, after slowing to 8.7
percent in 2009, due to a massive expansion of gas facilities
and government infrastructure spending.

 MOSCOW, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
will sign agreements to help build Vietnam's first nuclear power
plant and a hydroelectric power station during a visit to the
Soviet-era ally starting on Saturday, Kremlin sources said.
 Bolstering economic cooperation has been Russia's main focus
in recent years in relations with Vietnam, site of a Cold War

Union's biggest naval base abroad.
 Trade between Russia and Vietnam increased to $1.56 billion
last year from $1.4 billion a year ago and was up another 16.6
percent year-on-year in the first half of 2010, according to
Russian government figures.
 Medvedev's visit will start with meetings with the leaders
of the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)
in Hanoi, the first Russian-ASEAN summit since the inaugural one
in 2005.
 The bilateral agenda with Vietnam included the signing of an
agreement to launch the construction of a nuclear power plant,
and Russia might loan money to help build it, a Kremlin source
told reporters on Thursday.
 Russia and Vietnam agreed to cooperate on Vietnam's first
nuclear power plant in a memorandum of understanding signed
after talks between Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and
his Vietnamese counterpart last December.
 Russia has been actively pursuing deals to build nuclear
power plants abroad. It recently completed the reactor at Iran's
first nuclear power plant and signed a deal to build a powerful
two-reactor station in Venezuela earlier this month.
 Russia's Rushydro company and Vietnam's state-owned oil
group Petrovietnam would sign an agreement to build a
hydroelectric power station, the Kremlin source said.
 The power station on the Da river will be upstream from
another one already being built by Rushydro.
 The Kremlin source both countries would also sign a
memorandum to help set up the acquisition of British oil group
BP's assets in Vietnam by Russian oil firm TNK-BP, which is half
owned by BP.
 TNK-BP said earlier this month it would acquire BP's
production and pipeline assets in Vietnam and Venezuela for $1.8
billion.

 NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Bond prices jumped and the
dollar eased on Friday after data showed the U.S. economy grew
in the third quarter but not briskly enough to alter
expectations of Federal Reserve monetary easing next week.
 U.S. Treasuries gained after the government's estimate of
gross domestic product was in line with analysts' forecasts of
a 2.0 percent rise. But a bigger-than-expected gain in business
inventories pointed to underlying weakness in the U.S. economy.

 Trading was subdued in anticipation of a Fed announcement
next Wednesday and the outcome of U.S. elections on Tuesday,
with polls indicating Republicans will wrest control of the
U.S. House of Representatives. [ID:nUSVOTE]
 Treasuries also rallied as the GDP reported showed core
inflation under 1 percent, which supported expectations the Fed
would try to support the economy by buying assets.
 The 30-year bond  outperformed shorter
maturities, gaining 38/32 in price to yield 3.99 percent. The
benchmark 10-year note  rose 18/32 in price to yield
2.60 percent.
 ""We're going to be in a prolonged period of relatively low
interest rates,"" said James Sarni, managing principal and
senior portfolio manager at Los Angeles-based Payden & Rygel,
with $55 billion in assets under management.
 Fed policymakers are expected to announce new bond
purchases to push borrowing costs lower and energize a sluggish
recovery when their two-day meeting ends on Wednesday. A recent
Reuters poll of economists found they expected the Fed to buy
between $80 billion and $100 billion a month. [ID:nNLLRLE6LL].
 The dollar index, a gauge of its performance against six
major currencies, edged lower while the Japanese yen hovered
near its record peak in 1995 of 79.75 yen to the dollar.
 Investors bet the Bank of Japan will not intervene to
weaken the yen before the Fed's announcement next week. The
dollar  slipped 0.65 percent at 80.47 against the yen and

percent.
 Investors are betting volatility will rise and have hedged
against unexpected outcomes from the Fed meeting and the

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Uncertainty over a fresh round
of U.S. monetary easing weighed on the dollar on Friday,
prompting investors in the options market to hedge against any
volatility arising from the Federal Reserve decision.
 The dollar fell against the yen and was just shy of a
15-year low hit on Monday, with lackluster U.S. gross domestic
product data failing to shake expectations of further stimulus
for the economy from the Fed. Quantitative easing is viewed as
negative for the greenback as it increases the supply of
dollars, diminishing its value. For an economy wrapup, click on
[ID:nN28207235].
 In late afternoon trading, the dollar was down 0.6 percent
at 80.42 yen, on track for its lowest close on record,
according to Reuters data.
 At the same time, signals emanating from the currency
options market on Friday are flagging concern about next week's
events, which also include U.S. elections and a non-farm
payrolls report for October.
 ""There's a little anxiety in the market, and this may be
about quantitative easing,"" said Simon Smollett, senior
currency options strategist, at Credit Agricole in London.
 ""This may also be about the fact that most currencies have
been overbought against the dollar. There is a whole load of
factors here, and the bottom line is that the 'risk off'
hedging behavior has crept back into the market even if the
price action in spot has been relatively modest.""
 One important gauge showing increased worry is the
euro/dollar risk reversal, a barometer of currency sentiment,
which is indicating a decline in the curve or a growing bearish
view on the currency pair.
 The euro this past year has become a proxy for risk
appetite in the developed world, rising when there is increased
risk-taking in the market and falling when investors become
averse to risk.
 The single currency's ""put"" bias has deepened. On Friday,
puts are being traded at a mid-market of -0.925
vol, according to GFI data, with bids at -1.30.
This was a steep drop from bids of -0.55 vol on October 14.
 ""There is clearly an interest to buy the downside in
euro/dollar. The market seems to be warning of a move lower in
spot (price of the euro),"" Smollet said.
 Euro gains so far this month have slowed to around 2
percent from a steep 7.5 percent rise in September. On the
week, the euro was down 0.3 percent, its worst weekly
performance since mid-September.
 This week's decline in the euro versus the dollar is
consistent with the pullback in U.S. dollar shorts to $23
billion in the week ended Oct. 26. The euro, sterling, and yen
all saw small declines in the extent of their net long
positioning against the dollar, while the Swiss franc saw a
small increase. See report [IMM/FX].
 RISING PUTS, IMPLIED VOLS
 The options market has also been increasingly wary of the
Australian dollar, the euro versus the yen, and Korean won,
currencies that thrive in global expansions and rising equity
and commodity markets. Their risk reversals have shown an
increasing put bias as well.
 Implied volatility, another market sentiment gauge, has
also spiked in recent sessions. One-week euro/dollar vols have
gained over 4 vols the last couple of days to hit the 17.0
handle on Friday although one-month vols remained confined in
the upper-13 range.
 Sone analysts suggest nervousness about quantitative easing
seemed misplaced since most believe the Federal Reserve will
err on the side of caution and announce next week a figure that
is more in line with market expectations. According to a
Reuters poll, most leading economists expect the Fed to buy
between $80-$100 billion worth of assets per month.
[ID:nNLLRLE6LL].
 ""The FOMC might end up with a QE3 and a QE4 if the economy
really sours, but it can't reasonably announce much more than a
half-trillion for QE2 at this point,"" said Avery Shenfeld,
chief economist at CIBC World Markets in Toronto.
 ""Expectations for more than a trillion in one fell swoop
have rightly dwindled, so we don't see much of a market shock
from the coming week's Fed announcement.""
 But congressional elections on Tuesday could have
implications for fiscal policy, and Shenfeld thinks the market
could well focus on this vote instead of the Fed.
 Betting websites suggested that Republicans have a 90
percent chance of taking the House of Representatives. A
Republican victory should be positive for the dollar, Westpac
senior currency strategist Richard Franulovich said.
 The Republicans, he said, have been campaigning on a
platform of fiscal prudence and this is a ""confidence-building
event"" for the dollar because it undermines the long-run
bearish arguments against the greenback with respect to
structural imbalances.

 TORONTO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar rose against
its U.S. counterpart on Friday, thanks to healthy economic data
from both sides of the border, while doubts about further
monetary easing by the Federal Reserve weighed on the
greenback.
 The combination of the GDP data and a softer U.S. dollar
helped lift the Canadian currency  to a high of
C$1.0168 to the U.S. dollar, or 98.35 U.S. cents.
 Government data showed Canada's economic recovery picked up
speed again in August after stalling in July. Gross domestic
product climbed 0.3 percent, bolstered by wholesale trade,
manufacturing and oil and gas extraction. GDP shrank 0.1
percent in July, the first contraction in a year.
[ID:nN29223306]
 As well, U.S. data showed economic growth edged up as
expected in the third quarter but not enough to chip away at
high unemployment or change perceptions of more monetary easing
from the Federal Reserve next week. [ID:nN28207235]
 Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital
Markets, said the Canadian currency got a boost from the data,
which helped to reduce investor risk aversion.
 ""As we entered the North American session, the data came in
either in line with expectations or beating expectations,"" he
said.
 ""It was a paring of risk aversion. This morning, the
futures were significantly negative. Throughout the North
American trading session they became less negative.""
 The currency ended at C$1.0202 to the U.S. dollar, or 98.02
U.S. cents, up from Thursday's close at C$1.0215 to the U.S.
dollar, or 97.90 U.S. cents.
 In the background, ""the dominate debate and issue is
quantitative easing next week,"" added Strauss.
 The uncertainty surrounding a fresh round of U.S. monetary
easing ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting
weighed on the U.S. dollar on Friday and prompted investors in
the options market to hedge against any possible volatility.
[FRX/]
 Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia
Capital, said ""there's a lot of risk going into the FOMC,""
referring to the U.S. central bank's policy-setting meeting
next week.
 ""The potential was that we saw a stronger than expected GDP
print and then that would create fears that the FOMC wouldn't
be as aggressive as the market thinks they're going to be right
now, and that would cause U.S. dollar short covering. With the
relief of that out of the way, the U.S. dollar is weakening off
again,"" she said.
 Investors have been reassessing their estimates of how much
money the Federal Reserve may commit to a second round of
monetary stimulus -- widely dubbed ""QE2"" -- when it meets.
[FRX/]
 BONDS HIGHER
 Canadian government bond prices were flat to higher,
tracking U.S. Treasuries where debt prices rose ahead of next
week's Fed meeting at which the U.S. central bank is expected
to announce large-scale purchases of assets. [US/]
 RBC's Strauss said bonds were following a recent trend that
has seen them push higher.
 ""It's a realization that the Fed will engage quantitative
easing, although in a not too aggressive way. I think the
uncertainty is that it could continue with this program well
into 2011, which could delay the resumption of the Bank of
Canada's tightening or normalization campaign,"" he said.
 The Bank of Canada said last week it would have to consider
any further rate hikes carefully, given the patchy global
recovery, a weak U.S. outlook and expected curbs on Canadian
growth. For Take a Look, please see: [ID:nN27276109]

 * Month-end positioning helps real recoup some losses
(Updates prices, adds comments)
 By Samantha Pearson
 SAO PAULO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The Brazilian real rose on
Friday but still recorded its biggest monthly loss since May as
efforts by the government to curb its strength started to take
effect.
 Meanwhile, uncertainty over an expected announcement next
week about U.S. stimulus measures prompted volatile trading
across the region, keeping a lid on gains in the Mexican and
Chilean pesos.
 The real recorded a loss of 0.65 percent for October. That
compared with a 1.1 percent monthly loss for the Chilean peso
and a gain of 1.8 percent by the Mexican peso.
 Brazil has introduced a series of tax rises this month in
an effort to curb a recent rally in the real that is hurting
exporters and widening the current account deficit.
 Foreign investors have responded by sharply reducing
positions in the currency derivatives markets. [ID:nN28128305]
 Brazil's treasury also reduced its local bond issuance even
further on Thursday, reflecting reduced demand from investors
for the country's debt. [ID:nN28152112]
 Some analysts think the government may be waiting until the
Brazilian presidential election is over this weekend before
announcing further measures.
 Still, the real  closed 0.64 percent stronger at
1.701 reais per U.S. dollar on the local spot market on
Friday.
 Local traders were bidding up the currency on the last day
of the month in order to secure a higher so-called Ptax rate -
the average rate taken from the spot market every day that is
used as a reference to settle futures contracts. The higher the
rate, the more money they can potentially make on these
contracts.
 Last month, the central bank announced it would crack down
on this type of manipulation by calculating the rate as a
simple average of the day's trading, rather than a
volume-weighted average, as is currently the case. But the rule
change does not take effect until July 2011. [ID:nN23234691]
 ""There is the battle over the Ptax as always and flows keep
coming in,"" said Carlos Gandolfo, a partner at Sao Paulo's
Pioneer brokerage.
 However, he said volumes were very low ahead of the holiday
weekend. A public holiday on Tuesday means many people will
also take Monday off, even though it is the first trading day
after the election, he said.
 FED WAITING GAME
 The main focus on trading floors remained stimulus measures
in the United States.
 The Federal Reserve is expected to announce next week a
fresh round of monetary easing, which should keep returns on
U.S. Treasuries close to record lows and encourage investors to
buy more of Latin America's higher-yielding debt.
 But doubts about how big that stimulus package will be have
contributed to volatile trading in recent sessions.
 The Mexican currency  was flat at 12.3705 per dollar
on Friday as the U.S. currency traded in a narrow range against
a basket of the world's major currencies <.DXY>.
 The country's central bank has a very light presence in the
foreign exchange market, compared with other countries in the
region. On Friday it sold dollar put options at auction worth
$600 million. [ID:nMEX003885]
 The Chilean peso , which has suffered heavy losses
this month due to the threat of intervention, also traded flat
at 489 per dollar.
 Chile has moderated the pace at which it has hiked interest
rates in an effort to slow the peso's gains.
 Minutes from the central bank's October policy meeting
released on Friday said the peso's sharp appreciation, along
with slower inflation, points to a more gradual pace of
interest rate hikes.[ID:nSAG002645]

 * Few problems remain to be solved
 * Georgia wants new trade talks with Russia
 
 By Gleb Bryanski
 MOSCOW, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Russia's negotiations to join the
World Trade Organisation (WTO) are gathering momentum, the
country's top negotiator said on Friday after the country
wrapped up the latest round of accession talks in Geneva. 
 Russia has been seeking WTO membership since 1993 and with a
gross domestic product of $1.2 trillion is by far the largest
economy outside the 153-member organisation. 
 U.S. President Barack Obama will discuss the Russian bid
with President Dmitry Medvedev on the sidelines of Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation meeting in Japan on Nov. 14. 
 ""The talks are gathering momentum. The number of issues to
be solved is very insignificant compared with the number of
issues that were solved already,"" Maxim Medvedkov told Reuters
in a telephone interview from Geneva. 
 ""It does not mean that problems cannot arise but we have a
common understanding with our partners about how to solve them,""
Medvedkov said. 
 Medvedkov said the remaining issues in negotiations on
tariffs included timber and meat tariffs while there were no
serious issues in negotiations on services. The talks will
resume at the start of December. 
 Talks on Russia's WTO entry accelerated after a June summit
in Washington when Obama and Medvedev urged negotiators to reach
a deal by the end of September 2010.
 White House National Economic Council director Larry Summers
visited Moscow last week for a meeting with government officials
saying ""end is in sight"" for Russia's bid. 
 Medvedkov said the accession working party, which includes
62 states, was working on changes to its report, which will
serve as the basis for membership, linked to creation of the
customs union between Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus this year. 
 Medvedkov said that Georgia, which fought a brief war with
Russia in August 2008 and is objecting to the Russian
membership, had requested additional talks with Russia. He said
Georgia did not specify what it wants to discuss. There was no
immediate comment from Georgia.
As an existing member of the trade bloc, Georgia can veto
Russia's long-delayed accession. But to do that risks irritating
ally the United States, which backs Russia's entry to the WTO as
part of a plan to ""re-set"" troubled relations with Moscow. 
 Georgia says Moscow should not be admitted to the
organisation until it has agreed to a deal with Tbilisi over
customs controls on the internationally recognised border
between the two countries.
 Medvedkov said Russia had also yet to agree with the working
party members its agricultural subsidies which it wants increase
to $9 billion next year but gradually reduce back to the current
level of about $4.4 billion between 2013 and 2017.
 ""Members of the working group are treating our proposals
positively but it is early to predict the final outcome. I do
not think we will face big problems there,"" Medvedkov said.

 MEXICO CITY/SAO PAULO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Latin American
stocks rose on Friday on positive corporate earnings reports
and sustained bets the U.S. Federal Reserve will move to inject
funds into the U.S. economy next week.
 Earnings season has ended in Mexico, with companies
collectively posting an 8 percent increase in third-quarter
profit from the same period a year ago.
 ""Today the market is primarily riding on upbeat company
earnings,"" said Tulio Chavez, a trader at brokerage Actinver in
Mexico City. ""But we also continue to see liquidity from the
Fed speculation.""
 The MSCI Latin American stocks index <.MILA00000PUS> added
0.87 percent. Expectations of a cash injection from the U.S.
central bank have helped Latin American stocks pack on nearly
12 percent since Sept. 1.
 Mexico's IPC <.MXX> added 0.5 percent.
 Retailer Elektra , which is controlled by media
and telecom baron Ricardo Salinas, jumped 4.44 percent after
third-quarter earnings beat expectations.
 ""Elektra turned in the best results of the industry,""
Fernando Olvera, an analyst at BBVA Bancomer, wrote in a
research report on Friday. ""Recovering consumer demand in
Mexico should favor the company in 2011.""
 Elektra specializes in selling big-ticket appliances to
low-income clients and charges high interest rates.
 In Brazil, the BVSP <.BVSP> gained 0.45 percent.
 ""On balance, earnings reports have been positive,"" said

 But investors could turn cautious before the market's close
ahead of Sunday's presidential election in Brazil, he added.
 The most commonly traded shares of Petrobras 
edged up 0.08 percent. The shares gained 8.13 percent during
a six-session rally.
 Most of those gains came on trader speculation the
state-run company was preparing to unveil a large oil find.
 The ANP oil regulator said on Friday that the Libra oil
prospect could hold as much as 15 billion barrels of oil
equivalent. [ID:nN29160461]
 Nonvoting shares of Usiminas , the most commonly

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The uncertainty surrounding a
fresh round of U.S. monetary easing has weighed on the dollar
on Friday and prompted investors in the options market to hedge
against any volatility arising from it.
 The dollar fell against the yen, just shy of a 15-year low
hit on Monday, with lackluster U.S. GDP data in the second
quarter failing to shake expectations of further stimulus for
the economy. Quantitative easing is viewed as negative for the
greenback as it increases the supply of dollars in the
financial system, diminishing its value.
 At the same time, signals emanating from the currency
options market on Friday are flagging concern about next week's
events, which also include U.S. elections and a non-farm
payrolls report for October.
 ""There's a little anxiety in the market and this may be
about quantitative easing,"" said Simon Smollett, senior
currency options strategist, at Credit Agricole in London.
 ""This may also be about the fact that most currencies have
been overbought against the dollar. There is a whole load of
factors here and the bottom line is that the 'risk off' hedging
behavior has crept back into the market even if the price
action in spot has been relatively modest.""
 One important gauge showing increased worry is the
euro/dollar risk reversal, a barometer of currency sentiment,
which is indicating a decline in the curve or a growing bearish
view on the currency pair.
 The euro this past year has become a proxy for risk
appetite in the developed world, rising when there is increased
risk-taking in the market and falling when investors become
averse to risk.
 The single currency's ""put"" bias has deepened. On Friday,
puts are being traded at a mid-market of -0.925 vol, according
to GFI data, with bids at -1.30. This was a steep drop from
bids of -0.55 vol on October 14.
 ""There is clearly an interest to buy the downside in
euro/dollar. The market seems to be warning of a move lower in
spot (price of the euro),"" Smollet said.
 Euro gains so far this month have slowed to around 2
percent from a steep 7.5 percent rise in September. On the
week, the euro was down 0.3 percent, its worst weekly
performance since mid-September.
 RISING PUTS, IMPLIED VOLS
 The options market has also been increasingly wary of the
Australian dollar, the euro versus the yen, and Korean won,
currencies that thrive in global expansions and rising equity
and commodity markets. Their risk reversals have shown
increasing put bias as well.
 Implied volatility, another market sentiment gauge, has
also spiked in recent sessions. One-week euro/dollar vols have
gained over 4 vols the last couple of days to hit the 17.0
handle on Friday although one-month vols remained confined in
the upper-13 range.
 Sone analysts suggest nervousness about quantitative easing
seemed misplaced since most believe the Federal Reserve will
err on the side of caution and announce next week a figure that
is more in line with market expectations. According to a
Reuters poll, most leading economists expect the Fed to buy
between $80-$100 billion worth of assets per month.
 ""The FOMC might end up with a QE3 and a QE4 if the economy
really sours, but it can't reasonably announce much more than a
half-trillion for QE2 at this point,"" said Avery Shenfeld,
chief economist at CIBC World Markets in Toronto.
 ""Expectations for more than a trillion in one fell swoop
have rightly dwindled so we don't see much of a market shock
from the coming week's Fed announcement.""
 On the other hand, U.S. congressional elections on Tuesday
could have implications for fiscal policy and Shenfeld thinks
the market could well focus on this vote instead of the FOMC.
 Online prediction markets suggested that Republicans have
an overwhelming 90 percent chance of taking the House of
Representatives. A Republican victory in next week's U.S.
mid-term elections should be positive for the dollar, Westpac
senior currency strategist Richard Franulovich said.
 The Republicans, he said, have been campaigning on a
platform of fiscal prudence and this is a ""confidence-building
event"" for the dollar because it undermines the long-run
bearish arguments against the greenback with respect to
structural imbalances.

 By Caroline Copley
 LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - A British court turned down
French engineering firm Alstom's request to block Eurostar from
finalising a 600 million euros ($832.7 million) high-speed train
order with Germany's Siemens.
 Alstom remained defiant after the refusal, saying in a
statement late on Friday it was pursuing legal alternatives and
had already submitted its case to the European Commission.
 Eurostar, the sole operator of passenger trains through the
Channel Tunnel, has traditionally relied on Alstom for its
rolling stock. Its decision to order 10 trains from Siemens has
threatened to engulf France and Germany in a protectionist row.
 Alstom had asked the court to issue an injunction against
the order, arguing Eurostar had breached procurement laws and
that the trains it was ordering from Siemens would not comply
with safety rules.
 The French government has said the proposed Siemens trains
are not long enough in case passengers need to be evacuated, and
that their engine and power-supply layout pose a safety risk in
case of fire.
 But Judge Geoffrey Vos said that if the injunction was
granted and Alstom's case went to trial, it would probably not
be resolved until Spring 2011. A delay to Eurostar of that
nature would be costly to the travelling public, he added.
 ""Public interest is served by the introduction of timely
competition for Channel Tunnel services,"" Vos told Britain's
High Court in London on Friday.
 Alstom responded by saying in a statement Judge Vos had
recognised that it had shown the case was ""serious"". It added it
would pursue ""alternative legal options"" to uphold its position.
 Alstom is a market leader in high-speed rolling stock and
the French government has expressed misgivings about its
national champion losing out in its own backyard.
 Its shares extended losses following the ruling and closed
down 0.85 percent at 36.26 euros while the Paris CAC 40 index
ended flat. Siemens shares closed down 0.4 percent to 82.08
euros, with Germany's DAX up 0.1 percent.
 ""We are very pleased that the situation has been resolved
and we can proceed to signing the contract for our new fleet of
trains with Siemens,"" Eurostar said in a statement.
 Deutsche Bahn, which also plans to run services through the
Channel Tunnel in a bid to link London directly to Frankfurt and
Amsterdam, has a 500 million euros order with Siemens for 15 ICE
3 trains similar to those ordered by Eurostar.
 ""We have every confidence in the legal integrity of our bid
and we remain delighted that we won the (Eurostar) tender,""
Siemens said in a statement.
 The Franco-British Intergovernmental Commission (IGC),
governing the operation of the Channel Tunnel, is reviewing
safety regulations on the line.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Bond prices rose and the
dollar eased on Friday after data showed the U.S. economy grew
last quarter but not briskly enough to alter expectations of
Federal Reserve monetary easing next week.
 U.S. Treasuries and German bund futures gained after the
government's estimate of gross domestic product was in line
with analysts' forecasts of a 2.0 percent rise. But a
bigger-than-expected jump in business inventories pointed to
underlying weakness in the U.S. economy. For details see:
[ID:nN28207235]
 Still, the GDP report took a backseat to expectations Fed
policymakers at their two-day meeting ending on next Wednesday
will announce new bond purchases of at least $100 billion a
month to push borrowing costs lower and energize a sluggish
recovery.
 While the dollar index, a gauge of its performance against
six major currencies, was little changed, the yen hovered close
to the record peak in 1995 of 79.75 yen to the dollar.
 Investors bet the Bank of Japan will not intervene to
weaken the yen before the Fed's announcement next week. The
dollar  was down 0.62 percent at 80.50 against the yen
and the Dollar Index <.DXY> down 0.15 percent at 77.189.
 ""There's big news next week and most of it is built into
the market,"" said Richard Sichel, chief investment officer at
Philadelphia Trust Co.
 Forecasts for fourth-quarter and first-quarter GDP growth
will be cut by up to half a percentage point because of the
build-up in U.S. inventories, said Cary Leahey, an economist at
Decision Economics in New York.
 ""Bond prices jumped because the huge increase in
inventories will have to be worked off in the fourth quarter of
2010 and the first quarter of 2011,"" Leahey said.

14/32 in price to yield 2.62 percent.

pointing towards a double dip. Overall, it doesn't change the
expectation of more monetary easing from the Fed,"" BNP Paribas

 * Objections to many of the suggestions
 * Cash to help poor curb emissions, tackle drought or floods
 
 By Alister Doyle, Environment Correspondent
 OSLO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Carbon markets and taxes on foreign
exchange deals or plane tickets are among suggested sources for
a promised $100 billion a year from 2020 to help poor nations
fight climate change, a draft report by U.N. advisers said.
 The draft, obtained by Reuters on Friday, showed that the
group co-chaired by Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg
and Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi reckoned that both the
public and private sectors would have to be tapped for cash.
 Industrialised nations promised at the U.N. Copenhagen
summit last year to a goal of raising $100 billion a year from
2020 to help developing nations combat climate change and adapt
to impacts such as droughts, floods or rising sea levels.
 The U.N. expert group was set up to suggest how.
 Among their suggestions are to raise between $2 and $27
billion from financial transaction taxes on foreign exchange,
$4-$9 billion from shipping, $2-$3 billion from aviation, $3-$8
billion from removal of fossil fuel subsidies or $8-38 billion
from auctioning carbon allowances.
 The 35-page draft, written just before the final meeting of
the group on Oct. 12 in Ethiopia, lays out a wide range of
options. It says that loans, rather than outright grants, may be
part of the cash.
 But it said there were objections to many suggestions, such
as imposing a 0.001 to 0.01 percent tax on projected 2020
foreign exchange transactions estimated at $756 trillion.
 ""The lack of political acceptability and unresolved issues
of developing countries incidence makes it ... difficult to
implement universally,"" it said. 
 
 STALLED TALKS
 It also said there was limited ""political acceptability"" for
a possibility, suggested last year by billionaire George Soros,
of raising money based on Special Drawing Rights, the reserve
asset of the International Monetary Fund.
 And it relies heavily on carbon. The draft said that ""new
carbon-based public instruments and a carbon price in the range
of $20-$25 a tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2020"" were
""key elements"" to reach the $100 billion goal.
 The group will submit its final report on Nov. 4 to U.N.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as part of efforts to revive
stalled U.N. talks on a new climate treaty. Rich nations have
been reluctant to promise cash amid budget cuts at home.
 The report concludes that the target of $100 billion a year
is ""challenging but feasible"" -- a phrase used by Stoltenberg
after the final meeting in Addis Ababa.
 Some developing nations and environmental groups want all
the cash to be government grants, rather than from the private
sector or in the form of loans.
 ""The report misses the mark in not stating clearly that $100
billion can all be raised by public finances,"" said David Waskow
of Oxfam International. He said it was wrong to suggest lending
to poor nations suffering from emissions by richstates.
 ""If you damage your neighbour's house or car you wouldn't
lend them money to fix it. You would pay them,"" he said. Still,
he said the report was a platform for talks among environment
ministers who will meet in Cancun, Mexico, from Nov. 29-Dec. 10.
 The draft report gives an overview of sources without a
clear blueprint of how to raise the cash. Under varying
assumptions, it said the public sector could mobilise more than
$100 billion and the private sector up to $500 billion a year.

 (Adds details, updates prices)
 NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The dollar was down against
the yen but edged up against the euro on Friday after U.S.
economic data did nothing to reduce expectations that the
Federal Reserve will commit to a new round of monetary stimulus
next week.
 The dollar index, a measure of the dollar's performance
against a basket of six currencies, was flat as investors
positioned for an initial debasement of the currency on the Fed
announcement.
 The yen hovered close to the record peak value of 79.75 yen
to the dollar from 1995 with investors betting that the Bank of
Japan will not intervene to weaken the yen before the Federal
Reserve makes its announcement.
 The Fed has telegraphed its intent to boost growth by
pumping more money into the economy through direct government
bond purchases. The only uncertainty is how much money the Fed
is willing to spend.
 A survey by the New York Federal Reserve of dealers and
investors included scenarios of up to $1 trillion, a figure
larger than recent estimates. [ID:nLDE69R15M]
 Analysts say possible scenarios include the Fed starting at
$80 billion to $100 billion a month but leaving itself the
option to buy more. [FED/R]
 U.S. economic reports included an advance read on U.S.
third quarter gross domestic product, which expanded at a 2.0
percent annual rate, as expected. [ID:nN28207235].
""With growth steady but unimpressive and inflation pressures
very benign, it underscores the Fed's most recent message and
their concern with the inflationary readings,"" said Vassili
Serebriakov of Wells Fargo in New York. ""I do think it confirms
and perhaps reinforces expectations for the Fed's quantitative
easing move next week."" 
 Midway though the New York session, the dollar was down 0.4
percent at 80.49 yen , off a low of 80.46 on trading
platform EBS . Stop-loss orders were reported under
80.40 ahead of a layer of bids from 80.30 to 80.00.
 Friday's selling pushed the dollar toward a 15-year low of
80.41 yen and near a record trough of 79.75 also set in 1995.
 The yen is rising because Japanese investors are not
exporting enough capital to offset Japan's current account
surplus, nor to offset the hot money that has flowed into the
bill market and excess reserves, said Marc Chandler, said Marc
Chandler, Global Head of Currency Strategy at Brown Brothers
Harriman said in a note.
 While the yen's strength against the dollar is likely to
revive concern the Japanese authorities could intervene again
to stem the currency's appreciation, investors continue to push
the Japanese currency higher.
 The Bank of Japan on Thursday said boosting its 5 trillion
yen ($61 billion) asset-buying plan was a ""strong option"" if
the outlook for the economy sharply deteriorated.
[ID:nTOE69R085].
 The BOJ advanced its next policy review to Nov. 4-5, right
after the U.S. Federal Reserve meets, which markets took as a
sign it was ready to act swiftly if the outcome of the Fed's
Nov. 2-3 meeting triggered heavy dollar selling.
[ID:nTOE69R085].
 The 80-yen level ""seems to be the new line in the sand,""
said Greg Salvaggio, vice president of trading at Tempus
Consulting in Washington.
 The euro  fell as much as 1 percent to a session
low of 111.52 yen.
 The euro slipped 0.2 percent to $1.3900 , leaving the

 * Rules constructed to exempt Shah Deniz gas field
(Adds analyst comment, background)
 By Pete Harrison
 BRUSSELS, Oct 29 (Reuters) - European sanctions on Iran are
not intended to restrict Iranian imports or exports of oil,
officials say, but oil companies said they remained cautious
about doing business with Tehran.
 The EU sanctions have reduced trade since they were adopted
in July. They officially became law on Wednesday, putting extra
pressure on Tehran to return to negotiations over its uranium
enrichment programme.
 ""It is clear that the new rules are likely to mean more
administrative burden for businesses as well as the
authorities,"" said Georg Berrisch, a partner at the
international law firm Covington & Burling in Brussels.
 The rules block oil and gas investment in Iran and curtail
Tehran's refining and natural gas capability, but they have been
crafted in a way that reduces the impact on ordinary Iranians.
 ""The restrictive measures should not affect the import or
export of oil or gas to and from Iran, including the fulfilment
of payment obligations in connection with such import or
export,"" reads the legal document.
 But financial transfers of as little as 40,000 euros
($55,520) or more require authorisation, and it remains unclear
whether the bureaucracy involved and other wide-ranging
financial restrictions will continue to deter banks from
extending credit for oil deals.
 ""In particular the obligations to notify payments, but also
the possibility to apply for exemptions from certain export
prohibitions, will put a heavy burden on the national export
control authorities,"" said Berrisch. 
 European energy companies say they are reassessing their
trade with Tehran. Even though the EU allows oil and gas trade
with Iran, companies might still fall foul of U.S. sanctions
covering financial deals with the Islamic Republic. 
 ""At the moment we are reviewing the situation, trying to get
our heads round it. We need to take a view on how it affects
banking,"" said an industry source trading with Iran.
 
 AZERI GAS FIELD EXCLUDED
 Given that the crude market is over-supplied, the added
difficulties of trading with Iran may mean companies are more
likely to look elsewhere first, analysts say.
 The United States has not bought Iranian crude since 1995.
 Neither U.S. nor EU sanctions bar major Asian customers
Japan or China from buying Iranian crude, but oil trade with
both has slowed, Iran's OPEC governor said.
 Top Chinese energy firms, which had stepped into Iranian
energy projects to fill the gap left by Western companies, have
meanwhile slowed work on billions of dollars of deals in Iran as
their ties grow with U.S. energy companies.
 The EU measures have also been crafted to exclude
Azerbaijan's Shah Deniz gas project, in which Iranian state
energy firm NIOC has a stake. 
 Europe views the gas field as a big potential source of
supply that could reduce its reliance on Russia, and any
sanctions might damage its future energy security.
 Shah Deniz is not mentioned by name in the text of the
sanctions, but EU lawyers have carefully constructed an
exemption with the gas field in mind.
 ""Any body, entity or holder of rights derived from an
original award before the entry into force of this regulation by

 * Rules constructed to exempt Shah Deniz gas field

 By Pete Harrison
 BRUSSELS, Oct 29 (Reuters) - European sanctions on Iran are
not intended to restrict Iranian imports or exports of oil,
officials say, but the impact of wide-ranging financial
restrictions on its oil flows remains unclear.
 The EU sanctions became become law on Wednesday, putting
extra pressure on Tehran to return to negotiations over its
uranium enrichment programme.
 ""It is clear that the new rules are likely to mean more
administrative burden for businesses as well as the
authorities,"" said Georg Berrisch, a partner at the
international law firm Covington & Burling in Brussels.
 The rules block oil and gas investment in Iran and curtail
Tehran's refining and natural gas capability, but they have been
crafted in a way that reduces the impact on ordinary Iranian
citizens.
 ""The restrictive measures should not affect the import or
export of oil or gas to and from Iran, including the fulfilment
of payment obligations in connection with such import or
export,"" reads the legal document.
 But financial transfers of 40,000 euros ($55,520) or more
require authorisation, and it remains unclear whether the
bureaucracy involved and other wide-ranging financial
restrictions will continue to deter banks from extending credit
for oil deals.
 ""In particular the obligations to notify payments, but also
the possibility to apply for exemptions from certain export
prohibitions, will put a heavy burden on the national export
control authorities,"" said Berrisch. 
 ""One can only hope that they will be able to commit
sufficient resources -- otherwise chaos is likely,"" he added.
 The measures have also been crafted to exclude Azerbaijan's
Shah Deniz gas project, in which Iranian state energy firm NIOC
has a stake. 
 Europe views the gas field as a big potential source of
supply that could reduce its reliance on Russia, and any
sanctions might damage its future energy security.
 Shah Deniz is not mentioned by name in the text of the
sanctions, but EU lawyers have carefully constructed an
exemption with the gas field in mind.
 ""Any body, entity or holder of rights derived from an
original award before the entry into force of this regulation by
a sovereign government other than Iran, of a production-sharing
agreement shall not be considered an Iranian person, entity or
body,"" reads the complex legal text, which EU sources say refers
to Shah Deniz.

 NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The dollar rose broadly on
Friday after U.S. economic data did nothing to reduce
expectations that the Federal Reserve will commit to a new
round of monetary stimulus next week.
 Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.0 percent annual
rate as expected in the third quarter, the Commerce Department
said.
 The Fed has telegraphed its intent to boost growth by
pumping more money into the economy through direct government
bond purchases several times. The only uncertainty is how much
money the Fed is willing to spend.
 A survey by the New York Federal Reserve of dealers and
investors included scenarios of up to $1 trillion, a figure
larger than recent estimates.
 Analysts say possible scenarios include the Fed starting at
$80 billion to $100 billion a month but leaving itself the
option to do more.
 ""One component of the report that probably caught the
market's attention is the softer-than-expected core PCE
number,"" said Vassili Serebriakov at Wells Fargo in New York of
the U.S. economic data.
 ""With growth steady but unimpressive and inflation
pressures very benign, it underscores the Fed's most recent
message and their concern with the inflationary readings,"" said
Serebriakov. ""I do think it confirms and perhaps reinforces
expectations for the Fed's quantitative easing move next week.""
 The yen also rose broadly on Friday, coming within sight of
its 1995 record high versus the dollar.
 In early New York trade, the dollar was down 0.4 percent at
80.65 yen, off an earlier low of 80.53 on trading platform EBS.
Stop-loss orders were reported under 80.40 ahead of a layer of
bids from 80.30 to 80.00.
 Friday's selling pushed the dollar toward a 15-year low of
80.41 yen and near a record trough of 79.75 also set in 1995.
 The yen's strength against the dollar is likely to revive
jitters that the Japanese authorities could intervene again
soon to stem the currency's appreciation.
 The 80 level ""seems to be the new line in the sand,"" said
Greg Salvaggio, vice president of trading at Tempus Consulting
in Washington.
 But if the Fed engages in aggressive quantitative easing,
it is likely to push the dollar/yen to 75 yen, Salvaggio said.
If the Fed is less aggressive than expectations, the dollar
could jump to 85 to 87 yen and the euro could go to the low
$1.30's, he said.
 The euro fell as much as 1 percent to 111.52 yen, while the
Australian dollar last traded 0.5 percent lower at 78.74 yen.
The Australian dollar slid 0.2 percent to $0.9765.
 The euro slipped 0.2 percent to $1.3905, leaving the dollar
index little changed at 77.301.

 NAIROBI, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Kenya Airways said passenger
volumes rose in its second quarter ended September as the World
Cup in South Africa and route expansion lifted performance,
helping push its shares higher.
 The airline, one of the top carriers in the continent, said
on Friday passenger numbers were up 9 percent to 849,566 over
the same period in 2009.
 ""Uptake of total production at 2,466 million revenue

 ""The highest seat kilometre increase was registered in the

was due to additional frequencies into Johannesburg during the
World Cup, Harare and Lusaka together with the additions of
Ndola and Gaborone into the network.""
 At 1254 GMT, Kenya Airways shares changed hands at 44.75

highest climber in the benchmark index of 20 Kenyan companies.
 ""Of course I would expect the price to go up,"" said Samuel
Gichohi, investment analyst at Suntra Investment Bank, adding
that passenger volumes were also helped by the numerous
international conferences Kenya has hosted in recent months.
 Kenya Airways said the number of passengers it ferried to
Europe was up 14 percent to 142,567.
 However, the airline, which is 26 percent owned by Air
France-KLM, said cargo haulage fell 7 percent to 14,118 tonnes,
because of strained capacity.
 The airline said earlier this month it expected to carry 3
million passengers and 60,000 tonnes of cargo in its year ending
next March, thanks to expansion of its routes in Africa and the
Middle East.

 By Risa Maeda
 TOKYO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Japan's total oil product sales
rose 7.3 percent in September from a year earlier, government
data showed on Friday, marking the third straight month of gains
due mainly to the positive effect of a prolonged heat wave.
 Monthly data by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry
(METI) also showed that Japan, the world's No.3 oil-consuming
country, tripled its crude oil imports from Russia in September
from the same month a year earlier.
 Russia exported 1.56 million kiloliters (0.32 million
barrels per day) to Japan last month, ranking as its
fourth-biggest supplier for a second month in a row.
 The fourth spot is its highest ranking since the country
across the Sea of Japan started selling its new ESPO Blend crude
from the Far East port of Kozmino in late 2009.
 Russian oil accounted for 9.5 percent of the total imports.
 Iran was the third-biggest supplier, with crude exports up
17 percent from a year earlier at 1.75 million kl. Japan's
imports from Iran recovered from 1.42 million kl in August but
were down a hefty 31 percent from a year earlier.
 There are concerns over higher prices for crude of Iran
origin than for its rivals. Earlier this month, Inpex Corp,
Japan's top oil explorer, said it had pulled out from Iran's
Azadegan oil field project after U.S. sanctions against Tehran
over its nuclear programme posed a potential threat to the
company's business.
 Economic sanctions do not apply to crude trade between Iran
and Japan but have prompted banks to increase fees for letters
of credit for crude imports from Iran, traders said.
 ""It looks some are considering replacing a part of Iran
crude with an alternative in order to avoid the risk (of
uncertainty),"" said Hidetoshi Shioda, senior analyst at Nikko
Cordial Securities.
 
 AIR-CONDITIONING DEMAND
 As for domestic demand, gasoline sales rose 6.3 percent from
a year earlier and made up almost a third of total fuel
consumption of 15.71 million kilolitres last month as warmer
weather than average spurred the use of car air-conditioning.
 The rise in sales in Japan for the third month in a row came
against the backdrop of relatively low levels a year earlier,
when a slow recovery from the global financial crisis put a lid
on demand from the industrial sector, a METI official said.
 Total oil product sales rose year-on-year every month
between January and April this year, bucking a well-anticipated
trend of lower demand in a mature market.
 In September, sales of B- and C-type fuel oil, mainly used
by utilities, rose 55.2 percent from a year earlier to 1.66
million kilolitres as utilities nearly tripled their fuel oil
consumption to meet an 11.9 percent increase in power generation
amid hot weather.
 A rise of 16.7 percent in kerosene sales from a year earlier
was also attributed to the use of air conditioning at factories
and offices.

 * China's first ever rejection of U.S. corn cargo

 By Tracy Zheng, Niu Shuping and Tom Miles
 BEIJING, Oct 29 (Reuters) - China has rejected a cargo of
U.S. corn after finding it contained an unsanctioned genetically
modified strain, two sources familiar with the situation said on
Friday.
 ""China only allows 11 varieties of GM corn to be imported to
the country, and the cargo was found with GM material outside
the 11 varieties,"" said one source, who declined to be
identified.
 ""The animal and plant quarantine department has barred it
from entering China,"" the source said. He said it was supplied
by a Japanese trading house.
 The cargo of 50,000-60,000 tonnes was shipped to a port in
the China's southern province of Guangdong in September. The
problem was detected only in October, the same source said.
 China's first ever rejection of a U.S. corn cargo, if
confirmed, risks deepening a trade spat with the United States
and a bigger diplomatic row with Japan.
 Chinese quarantine officials at Shenzhen in Guangdong, which
accounted for half of the 513,000 tonnes of corn imported by
China last month, declined to comment.
 ""If we have any information there will be an official
announcement,"" said an official at the local quarantine bureau.
 A third corn trading source said he had heard one Japanese
cargo was ""in trouble"" in the south of China. But he could not
confirm it had been rejected.
 Chinese corn imports have rocketed this year, and are
expected to continue growing next year, after China's own
harvest couldn't keep up with a boom in demand, mainly driven by
production of corn-based animal feed.
 It was unclear if the rejection of a cargo on GMO grounds
would have a wider impact on the corn trade.
 China has long used its tough rules on GMOs to keep U.S.
corn out of its market, the world's second biggest. But,
struggling to keep up with demand, it gave its first safety
approval to a GMO strain of corn late last year and began
importing again this year, the vast majority of it from the
United States.
 Chinese relations with Japan have soured in recent months
following the detention of a Chinese fishing boat captain by the
Japanese coast guard after their boats collided near disputed
islands in the East China Sea.
 But the two countries' foreign ministers met on Friday in a
""very good atmosphere"", according to Japanese Foreign Minister
Seiji Maehara.
 U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will also visit
China on Saturday, stopping over on Hainan Island during a
two-week Asia-Pacific trip to meet Chinese State Councillor Dai
Bingguo.

1059,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2010 08:28AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-It's all about the Fed and QE," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The event putting investors'
positions most at risk in the coming week is the very opposite
of what they feared back in January.
 Then it was the ""exit strategy"" central bankers would employ
to unwind the liquidity they had pumped into the world's economy
to get it running again after the financial crisis.
 Now it is the prospect of a ""re-entry strategy"" -- the
Federal Reserve embarking after its meeting on Wednesday on
renewed asset-buying to stimulate the moribund U.S. economy with
a new quantitative easing (QE) programme.
 The risk is that what the Fed ends up doing will not justify
the huge investment plays that have already been put in place in
the run up to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
 ""There is scope for disappointment,"" said David Shairp,
global strategist for JPMorgan Asset Management. ""There is
always the danger it will be seen as too timid.""
 Financial markets are not totally fixated on the Fed's QE --
there are, for example, earnings seasons under way and signs of
good growth in China, Germany and even Britain, plus Bank of
England, European Central Bank and Bank of Japan meetings in the
week ahead.
 But as macro, top-down events go, there is little to compete
with it.
 Since the prospect of further QE was accepted by markets
around the time of the Jackson Hole central bankers' retreat in
late August, what was already a solid investment flow into
emerging markets has turned into a torrent.
 It is based on the notion that a) that is where the growth
is; b) QE will mean a weaker dollar with next to no yields,
pushing up emerging market currencies; and c) the financial
system is about to get a new boost of liquidity.
 Fund trackers EPFR Global say that nearly $70 billion net
has flowed into the emerging market stock funds they monitor
over this year, close to half of it since August. Year-to-date
flows into emerging market bonds funds, meanwhile, stand at a
net $46.4 billion compared with $9.48 billion for the whole of
2009.
 Developed economy stock markets have also been buoyed by the
prospect of new liquidity. In all, it took the MSCI all-country
world stock index to two-year highs during the past week.
 The dollar, meanwhile, has been clobbered, falling as much
as 9.7 percent against a basket of major currencies since late
August before bouncing back a bit this week.
 These huge moves would be at risk if the Fed does something
unexpected or markets have a rethink about what it all means.
 For that reason alone, JPMorgan Asset Management's Shairp
said he has called for his fund firm to take some risk off the
table.
 
 EXPECTATIONS
 So what could go wrong? The most obvious risk is that the
Fed will not meet minimum expectations.
 William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, has said that $500 billion of bond purchases would likely
have the same impact as a 0.5 or 0.75 percentage point decline
in the Fed's benchmark federal funds rate.
 But other, higher figures have been floated. Consider the
following from hedge fund Bullman Investment Management:
 ""Our view is that the $500 billion-$750 billion figure is
likely to be released by the FOMC and this may well not be
enough to appease markets.""
 Bullman added that the Fed may need to let loose $1 trillion
as a minimum for equity markets to avoid a correction.
 Markets in the past week have pulled back a bit, however,
after various comments from Fed officials were seen as
dampeners.
 Among them was Dudley saying the U.S. economic context would
determine whether an incremental or big bang approach to asset
purchases was better.
 This means that as well as the amount of QE, investors will
also have to digest any announcement about the length of the
period over which it will be delivered.
 And at the other end of the scale there is the question of
whether any of the amounts being floated will be enough to lift
the U.S. economy out of its difficulties.
 In that sense, markets could look at a QE release they have
priced in and reflect that it is actually a reflection of
weakness in what is still the world's largest economy.
 All in all, it points to one of the most tense weeks in ages
for investors.
 And if that is not enough, there is always the U.S. mid-term
elections on Tuesday.

 * Regional rare earth mining powerhouses take shape
 
 By Lucy Hornby
 BEIJING, Oct 29 (Reuters) - If plans in Beijing come to
fruition, a few miners will control all of China's rare earths
output, while a vibrant processing industry turns the country
into a net importer of the valuable raw materials.
 That day is a long way off. The world is currently focused
on a sharp reduction in international supply after China cut
export quotas for the minerals, which are used in a number of
electronics, military and other high-tech applications.
 Still, consolidation of Chinese rare earths miners is well
underway, while research institutes are developing applications
for a growing downstream industry, the secretary-general of the
Chinese Society of Rare Earths told Reuters on Friday.
 ""At the moment there is no plan to eliminate exports
altogether, but our society supports that and hopes the country
will move in that direction,"" Lin Donglu said.
 ""We should make our raw materials into high value added rare
earth products, then export that... In the past, we produced raw
materials and then foreign firms, including in Japan,
subcontracted the processing and sold it back to China.""
 ""Now that we have this technology, I am sorry but there's no
need to sell the raw materials and have them sold back to us. We
can do this processing, we can add the value downstream, if you
want to buy it you can buy that.""
 Lin's society doesn't set policy, but boasts a strong voice
over a sector that China once valued only for its export
dollars.
 His ideal would be for China, which currently produces 97
percent of rare earths although it only holds about one-third of
the world's reserves, to produce in proportion to its reserves,
while mines in other countries account for the rest.
 
 BUILDING THE VALUE CHAIN
 If China fully developed its own processing industry, it
would reverse current trade patterns whereby rare earths are
exported to Japan and elsewhere, then processed into materials
that are often brought back to China for final manufacture into
consumer goods or equipment.
 Japanese firms, and France's Rhodia, have already
established joint ventures in China's rare earths centre of
Baotou, to benefit from the cheaper raw materials there.
 Similar shifts as China fills in more and more of the
production chain have already been felt in other industries.
 Sharp cuts in China's export quotas have sparked interest in
rare earths mining elsewhere, including the revival of a
Molycorp Inc mine in California that used to dominate world
production, before the Chinese mines ramped up.
 At the moment, though, China produces more rare earths than
its processors can absorb. Fewer quotas have simply meant more
smuggling.
 Customs officials have found rare earths labelled as other
minerals at Qingdao port in northeast China, and cracked a group
that was smuggling rare earths out of Sichuan in the form of
coloured glass for remelting later, Lin said.
 He did not comment on expected export quotas for next year.
 CONSOLIDATION
 China argues that consolidation is needed to shore up prices
and address the environmental cost of rare earths mining, which
requires moving hundreds of square metres of dirt for each
tonne. Lack of environmental mitigation has allowed China to
produce rare earths at lower cost than other countries.
 China's rare earth output this year would be in the same
range as last year's 120,000 tonnes, Lin said, as smaller mines
continue production under the new consolidated ownership.
 Baotou Steel Rare Earth Group, which Lin used to head, now
controls almost all the rare earths production in northern
China's Inner Mongolia - accounting for over half of total
Chinese output. Most of that is the relatively less valuable
light rare earths, found together with iron ore.
 But it has to date made little effort to restore the ruined
grasslands or clean the water around its open pit mines.
 ""The wet ecology in the south means the damage that was
being done was immediately apparent. Inner Mongolia was a desert
to begin with so the damage wasn't as clear at first,"" Lin said.
 ""But actually, that's been polluted too.""
 In southern China, big state firms are still jostling for
dominance and mopping up their smaller private rivals.
 The local government in the Ganzhou area of Jiangxi has set
up a firm to consolidate and exploit the more valuable heavy
rare earths there, muscling out provincial miner Jiangxi Copper.
 National mining and trading heavyweight Minmetals is also
active in the region and Baotou plans to set up a unit there.
 Jiangxi Copper will instead control the light rare earths
resources in southwestern Sichuang Province, while Xiamen
Tungsten is the designated player for Fujian, Lin said.

 * Diplomacy rather than litigation as facts still uncertain
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Businesses in Japan, the United
States and European Union are crying foul over cuts in China's
export quotas of rare earths and calling on their governments to
sue Beijing at the World Trade Organization.
 China, which currently has a near-monopoly in supplies of
rare earths, has drastically reduced shipments to Japan of the
minerals, essential for many high-tech products.
 The cuts emerged during a territorial dispute between the
two Asian powers, giving rise to fears that China could use its
dominance as a political bargaining tool.
 But China says it will not exploit this for leverage, and
the reductions in export quotas aim to conserve a diminishing
natural resource and protect the environment.
 Could China's partners launch a dispute over the issue at
the WTO, and how likely are they to do so?
 CAN YOU SUE OVER EXPORT CURBS AT THE WTO?
 WTO rules focus on restrictions to imports, the source of
most disputes that come to the body that polices world trade.
 WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy pointed out last week that
most members have not made binding commitments on the use of
export taxes, in contrast to the way they control import duties.
 The WTO's basic treaty, the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, bans prohibitions and restrictions such as quotas on both
imports and exports.
 But among the exceptions it allows are measures to protect
health and those ""relating to the conservation of exhaustible
natural resources if such measures are made effective in
conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or
consumption.""
 It also allows restrictions on exports of domestic materials
to ensure supplies to domestic industry if the domestic price is
held below the world price under a government stabilisation plan
-- provided those restrictions do not help domestic industry
increase its exports or enjoy protection, or generally undermine
the WTO's basic principle of non-discrimination.
 So to win a case, the challengers would have to prove that
the cuts in quotas are about protectionism rather than
conservation, and that the curbs discriminate against foreign
users of the earths in favour of Chinese processors.
 And the plaintiffs would have to prove that disruptions to
supplies are the result of an official policy, something which
is by no means clear at the moment.
 HAVE THERE BEEN SIMILAR CASES?
 The WTO is dealing with a similar dispute over Chinese
export curbs on other raw materials such as bauxite and
magnesium.
 The challenge was launched by the European Union, joined by
the United States and Mexico.
 There too, China argues that it needs to restrict exports to
protect the environment and conserve resources, while the
plaintiffs say the measures discriminate against their
industries by driving up the world price of the materials.
 For China to prevail, it will need to show that the export
quotas are reducing production for all users to conserve
resources, rather than shifting supplies to domestic consumers.
 The challengers argue that China can meet its environmental
and conservation goals by means other than export restrictions.
 They can draw on a report in May by the WTO's secretariat
for the two-yearly review of China's trade policy, which said
the export curbs may not meet the stated goal of conservation
but give Chinese industry an unfair advantage.
 The case is proving so complicated that the panel of experts
examining it said last week it was delaying its ruling until
April next year.
 WILL IMPORTING COUNTRIES MOUNT A CHALLENGE?
 Officials in importing countries have expressed concerns
about rare earths, but have refrained from suggesting a full WTO
dispute is imminent, not least because of the uncertainty about
whether disruptions to supplies are politically motivated.
 WTO litigation is the final step in a dispute and trading
partners generally try to avoid a public row. Even the WTO
dispute process aims initially for an agreed solution rather
than imposed rulings and sanctions.
 Japan in particular is sensitive about relations with China.
Significantly, it did not join the EU, United States and Mexico
in the raw materials dispute as a plaintiff, and in fact has
never launched a dispute against China at the WTO.
 An official at Japan's trade ministry said Tokyo was still
investigating the rare earths situation. A WTO challenge
remained an option but nothing had been decided.
 Frank Hoffmeister, a senior aide to EU trade chief Karel De
Gucht, said on Tuesday that Brussels was monitoring the
situation to decide on possible legal action, but needed clear
facts.
 And a top White House official said on Thursday that
diplomacy was the approach for now and the facts were murky.
 President Barack Obama or Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
are likely to raise rare earths with Chinese leaders at the G20
summit in Seoul next month or on other forthcoming meetings in
Asia, said Jeffrey Bader, the senior National Security Council
for Asia.

 * Foresees changes passing without national referendums
 
 By Brian Rohan
 BERLIN, Oct 29 (Reuters) - An accord to amend the European
Union's main treaty is a step forward for Germany, even though
EU leaders killed off Berlin's proposal to punish rule breakers,
a leading German parliamentarian said on Friday.
 Gunther Krichbaum, chairman of parliament's European Union
Affairs Committee, told Reuters the agreement reached on
Thursday in Brussels meant progress for Europe's defences
against new financial crises.
 ""It is a great step forward because we now have a crisis
mechanism so that in the future we will not have to deal with
problems like the Greek crisis on an ad hoc basis,"" he said.
 EU leaders agreed to set up a permanent system to handle
sovereign debt problems such as those faced by Greece and
endorsed tougher budget rules including sanctions against states
that do not keep deficits and debt in check.
 Germany failed to win widespread support for demands to
suspend the voting rights of member states that break the rules,
a plan Krichbaum said had no future.
 ""It was painful ... and I am convinced it will not be
possible to implement it in the future either,"" he said, adding
that he saw the compromise as an overwhelming success.
 Changes to the treaty will be agreed by mid-2013 and are
part of Europe's efforts to ensure it can cope with any
repetition of the Greek debt crisis this year which threatened
the future of the euro.
 Germany, Europe's biggest economy, says a permanent system
must replace the ad-hoc 440-billion-euro safety net created in
May for all euro zone states. It says it should be partly funded
by the private sector and entail strict conditions.
 Krichbaum said he was confident the treaty changes could be
passed without difficulty as the proposals would be limited in

a referendum on the issue, smoothing the ratification process.
 ""Brussels is not increasing its power, so that means
national referendums are not needed... I think it will pass in
all member countries.""

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, June 13 (Reuters) - World stocks touched a 12-week
low on Monday as Chinese data highlighted concerns about weaker
global growth, prompting investors to unwind positions in
higher-risk assets and buy top-rated government bonds.
 The euro hit a record low against the safe-haven Swiss franc
while the cost of insuring Greek sovereign debt against default
rose to an all-time high. Investors are concerned by signs
policymakers are struggling to come to agreement on a second
bailout for Athens and that moves to involve private investors
will wind up triggering a technical debt default.
 Emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> lost a third of a percent but
major European shares inched up 0.3 percent <.FTEU3> and U.S.
stock futures  pointed to a firmer open on Wall Street
later after the Dow and S&P 500 indexes showed a sixth week of
losses on Friday.
""Equities look like a buy at these sorts of levels on a one
to two year view, but I would not read too much into it,"" said
David Coombs, fund manager at Rathbone Brothers, which has 15.2
billion pounds under management.
 ""The sovereign debt situation is likely to worsen and it
will be very hard to make significant headway for European
shares, until we get some clear resolution to Greece.""
 Chinese stocks ended at a 4-1/2 month low, hit by worries
about the impact of monetary policy tightening in an economy
which is a key driver of world growth.
 China's money growth slowed to a 30-month low in May and
banks extended fewer new loans than expected, while exports to
the United States and EU hit their weakest since late 2009.
[ID:nL3E7HD08U]
 Uncertainty over future U.S. monetary policy after the
Federal Reserve's $600-billion bond buying programme ends this
month also added to investor aversion to taking on more riskier
assets, especially going into the thinner summer months.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> briefly hit its
weakest since mid-March, before stabilising. The index has lost
nearly 8 percent since hitting a three-year peak in late April
and is very close to erasing all of its 2011 gains.
 Losses in the MSCI benchmark world index are driven by its
emerging component, which fell 2.3 percent since January, while
developed stocks <.MIWO00000PUS> are still up 0.6 percent
year-to-date.
 
 GREEK DEAL
 The euro fell as low as 1.20 Swiss francs . Against
the dollar it was up around 0.1 percent at $1.4360 ,
finding support on expectations that euro zone interest rates
would remain higher than those in the United States.
 Five-year credit default swaps on Greek sovereign debt rose
58 basis points on the day to a record high of 1,600 bps,
according to data monitor Markit. The bund futures  rose
10 ticks.
 European leaders are due to finalise a new rescue package
for Greece at a Brussels summit on June 23-24, but deep
divisions remain about how to get the private sector involved,
while the deal would not help reduce Greece's massive 340
billion euro debt load [ID:nLDE68T0MG].
 ""What the euro needs is a resolution to the Greek crisis and
the politicians and the central bankers do not appear to be
close to finding one,"" said Kit Juckes, currency strategist at
Societe Generale. 
 ""That uncertainty is weighing on the euro and I expect it to
be stuck in a $1.40-$1.47 range.""
 U.S. crude oil  fell 1.3 percent to $97.97 a barrel.
 Saudi Arabia will raise output to 10 million barrels per day
(bpd) in July, Saudi newspaper al-Hayat reported on Friday, as
Riyadh goes it alone in pumping more outside official OPEC
policy, aiming to place additional supplies among Asian buyers.
 The dollar <.DXY> was steady against a basket of major
currencies.

SINGAPORE)
 By Melanie Burton
 LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Base metals fell on Friday and
copper touched a three-week trough, as markets cut risk and
investors turned cautious ahead of next week's pivotal Federal
Reserve meeting and the dollar steadied.
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was trading
at $8,168.75 a tonne at 1019 GMT, having earlier fallen to
$8,140 -- its lowest since Oct. 8 -- compared with $8,340 at
the close on Thursday.
 The metal used in power and construction, rallied 6.7
percent over October to peak at $8,549, its highest since July,
2008, having advanced some 11 percent this year. 
 Aluminium, tin and nickel sank to their lowest in around a
month while zinc and lead fell by some four percent at one
stage.
 ""They (base metals) are under pressure -- it's the usual
suspects, a slightly firmer U.S. dollar, weaker equity markets
in Asia, and some profit-taking ahead of the Fed meeting next
week,"" said Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann.
 The main market focus remains what the Fed decides at its
meeting on Nov. 2-3, with U.S. growth data on Friday potentially
feeding into the debate over how big Fed asset-buying should be
this time around.
 Any move that weakens the dollar may lift industrial
metals, as a softer dollar makes commodities cheaper for holders
of other currencies.
 Major currencies were broadly in the ranges as investors
wait to see if the Fed says next week that it will resume
quantitative easing as many expect, and if so, on what scale and
over what period.
 Meanwhile, European shares fell slightly with miners weaker
on lower metals prices and traders also on the defensive.
 Fundamentally, a slowdown in the pace of inventory
withdrawals suggest demand for the metals may be moderating,
added Briesemann.
 ""There are increasing signs that demand momentum is coming
down at current high price levels. It can be seen in increasing
inventories, especially in Shanghai,"" he said.
 Stocks of zinc and aluminium in warehouses registered with
the Shanghai Futures Exchange grew this week, although copper
stocks dipped slightly, data showed. 
 The stream of U.S. results today that could impact the price
of industrial metals via currencies include U.S. Q3 GDP, while
the Institute for Supply Management releases the October index
of regional business activity at 1230 GMT.
 After that the ISM Chicago October manufacturing index is
due at 1345 GMT and the University of Michigan Consumers
sentiment for October at 1355 GMT.
 
 STOCKS INCREASE
 LME inventories of copper rose by 475 tonnes, the latest
data showed, with total inventories at 368,500 tonnes,
reflecting a slowdown in the pace of decline. However, LME
stocks have still fallen by a third from cycle highs above
555,000 tonnes in mid-February
 Inventories of tin and zinc also grew, data showed. Zinc
stocks have jumped by over 15,000 tonnes into New Orleans this
week. 
 Lead inventories fell, data showed, but remain close to
eight-year highs, while exchange stocks of nickel are expected
to reach record highs towards the end of the year. A trader
said that most industry is well supplied with metal, and will
want to keep low levels of inventories over the end of the year,
which will curb demand for physical metal.
 ""Most people are telling me they are well equipped to the
end of first half next year. For the physical guys, all you will
see is adjustments to their physical intake. They will be very
cautious running stocks over the year end,"" the trader said.
 Elsewhere, markets are still watching developments in Chile,
for news of a potential strike.
 Union workers at Chile's giant Collahuasi mine on Thursday
geared up for wage negotiations at the world's No. 3 copper
mine. Chilean output accounts for around one third of total
mined copper production.
 Aluminium fell to $2,305, its lowest since October 1, and
was at $2,321 per tonne, down from $2,347. The United States on
Thursday slapped an additional 59.31 percent duty on imports of
a key aluminium product from China.
 The trader said it is unlikely to immediately impact the
market as orders are winding down for the year end.
 Nickel at $22,766 a tonne, from a bid of $23,100. It earlier
fell as far as $22,661, a one-month low.
 LeadAT $2,430 a tonne was down some 3 percent from
$2,505.50, while zinc fell before steadying at $2,410 per tonne,
a decline from $2,494 on the close.
 Tin tumbled to $25,050 per tonne at one point, its cheapest
since Oct. 5 before settling at $25,400, down from $26,250.

"
1067,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2010 06:40AM ET</span>",HKMA steps in to clear yuan trade settlements," HONG KONG, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's central bank has
stepped in to settle trade-related yuan transactions after the
sole lender authorised to clear such trades with the mainland
ran out of its quota for the year.
 The HKMA said it had activated its 200 billion yuan ($30
billion) currency swap line with China's central bank to clear
currency transactions tied to exports and imports after the
Bank of China (Hong Kong) <2388.HK> -- the only bank designated
to clear those trades -- suddenly used up its 8 billion yuan
quota.
 It is not know how much of the swap line was used on
Friday.
 The announcement caught traders and market players off
guard in Hong Kong's fledgling yuan market, where trade has
taken off in the past few months since China and Hong Kong
widened the trade settlement scheme in July and allowed
investors broader access to the yuan.
 Analysts said the move may temporarily slow growth in the
Hong Kong's yuan market, which China is using as a test bed to
slowly internationalise its currency even while maintaining its
strict capital controls that prevent most foreign investors
from going onshore.
 ""Participating authorised institutions should accord
priority to trade transactions that are due for immediate
settlement,"" Arthur Yuen, deputy chief executive at the HKMA,
said in a press release.
 Currency traders said the Bank of China HK reaching its
quota likely meant that some of the settlements were not
trade-related, showing the huge hunger among foreign investors
to get ahold of the yuan in the Hong Kong market.
 The yuan may become harder to get for investors in the Hong
Kong market in the near-term.
 Analysts, however, said two of the more likely options to
prevent a larger squeeze could involve Beijing giving the Bank
of China HK a new temporary quota or further use of the Hong
Kong-China swap line.
 China is facing heavy criticism for keeping its currency
artificially weak and is trying to fight back against ""hot
money"" coming into its onshore markets.
 On Thursday, China's foreign exchange regulator said it had
uncovered fradulent trades worth $7.34 billion in ""hot money""
flows this year. This week the central bank appeared to push
the yuan lower to fend off any speculative funds coming in
after last week's interest rate hike.
 Yuan deposits and trade has surged in Hong Kong after a
landmark July agreement permitting broader yuan investment and
trade settlement. As of September, yuan deposits in Hong Kong
were up 15 percent from a month earlier at a cumulative 149.3
billion yuan ($19.5 billion).
 HSBC said in a note that busting the limits represent a
widening gap between institutional yuan demand and actual yuan
trade settlement volumes, fuelled by huge demand to hold the
yuan on expectations of further appreciation.
 ""If non-trade pressures were the primary reason for the
earlier than expected quota expiry, then Beijing will use this
as a means to impose supply constraints on institutional demand
for the yuan that does not conform with its longer-term plans
for internationalising the currency,"" HSBC said.
 Analysts said the limits to yuan supply in Hong Kong likely
meant the spot rate in Hong Kong would rise even more against
the dollar  compared with onshore rates .
 The huge hunger for yuan among international investors in
the limited Hong Kong market has created a discrepancy between
the two rates, with the yuan commanding a slight premium in
Hong Kong over mainland rates.

 * Weak economy, BOJ policy to cap yield
 * Supply also seen contained
 * Yield curve seen staying steep
 By Shinichi Saoshiro
 TOKYO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Japan's benchmark government bond
yield will dip back towards a seven-year trough this year and
stay low to March as the economy loses steam, monetary policy
stays loose and supply is contained, DIAM Asset Management said.
 The company, which managed 9.5 trillion yen ($117 billion)
in assets as of March, expects the 10-year JGB yield to fall to
0.850 percent at year-end before edging up to 0.900 percent in
March.
 The 10-year yield, which hit a seven-year low of 0.820
percent in early October, stood at 0.925 percent on Friday.
 ""We foresee the yield remaining low and rangebound based on
expectations that developed economies, including Japan, will
lose momentum through March as the impact from fiscal stimulus
fades,"" Nobuto Yamazaki, DIAM executive fund manager, told
Reuters on Thursday.
 But DIAM, as of September Japan's eighth largest asset
manager of publicly offered investment trusts, according to
Investment Trusts Association data, expects the yield curve to
remain steep through the fiscal year to March, as domestic banks
which bought superlong bonds earlier in the year for capital
gains become less active at the very long end.
 The 10-year/30-year yield spread was above 100 basis points
on Friday, having widened sharply from a trough of 82 basis
points in August.
 ""The main buyers of the maturities such as life insurers
won't aggressively push superlong yields lower while banks are
seen moving back towards the 10-year zone, adding to
steepening,"" Yamazaki said.
 He said a worse-than-expected slump in the economy might
change the low-yield scenario if the government then abandoned
fiscal austerity to fund stimulus packages.
 But supply worries have been scaled back since a ruling
party leadership contest in September in which Prime Minister
Naoto Kan defeated rival Ichiro Ozawa, a supporter of more
expansionary fiscal policy.
 Japan's debt is about twice the size of its GDP but Kan aims
to cap next year's new debt supply at 44 trillion yen ($543
billion).
 BOJ STANCE
 The BOJ's stance towards deflation was also likely to keep
the benchmark yield relatively low, Yamazaki said.
 ""The BOJ has set down a clear timeframe for its easy policy,
adding strong downward pressure on short to midterm yields. It's
difficult to imagine the 10-year yield rising towards 1.500
percent when the five-year yield is well anchored.""
 The central bank has signalled that it will keep interest
rates virtually at zero for several years by forecasting core
consumer inflation of 0.1 percent in the year through March 2012
and 0.6 percent in the following year -- far from the 1 percent
target it wants to see before hiking rates again.
 The five-year yielded 0.295 percent on Friday, up from a
seven-year low of 0.200 percent early in October.

(Adds quote, detail)
 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The yen rose to within sight of
its 1995 record high versus the dollar on Friday, rising broadly
as equity markets fell, pushing down the euro and high yielders
in trade made choppy by month-end flows.
 A pullback in riskier assets, triggered by soft Japanese
data, knocked the dollar towards a 15-year low of 80.41 yen,
within sight of a record trough of 79.75 also set in 1995.
 Soft Japanese manufacturing data [ID:nTIYSLE61H] prompted a
1.75 percent fall in the Nikkei average <.N225>, which had a
knock-on effect on global equities.
 ""The yen is outperforming on risk-aversion following the
Japanese data,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at UBS
in Zurich.
 ""The slowdown in manufacturing activity is mainly due to
slowing export growth on the back of a stronger yen.""
 A falling share market was seen testing Japanese
authorities' resolve on intervention, after they did so in
September to counter a push higher in the yen. [ID:nTOE69P01U]
 European stocks were down 0.4 percent <.FTEU3> and U.S.
equities looked set for a negative open. <.SPc1>
 The dollar was down 0.2 percent at 80.80 yen , off an
earlier low of 80.53 on trading platform EBS, with stop-losses
reported under 80.40 ahead of a layer of bids from 80.30 to
80.00.
 Traders said a Japanese house was a large buyer in the
European session, with estimates of up to one billion dollars
going through, but there was limited impact on the price. 
 The euro  fell 1 percent to 111.65 yen, while the
Australian dollar fell 1.2 percent to 78.24 yen  and 1
percent against the U.S. dollar  to $0.9678.
 Some mild dollar selling was anticipated at the European
month-end fixings thanks to outperformance in U.S. equities this
month.
 ""The large increase in U.S. equity market capitalisations
has led to a sell USD signal for all crosses,"" said analysts at
Barclays in a note to clients.
 
 IT'S STILL THE FED
 Investors are waiting to see if the Fed says next week that
it will resume quantitative easing as many expect, and if so, on
what scale.
 A New York Fed survey of dealers and investors included
scenarios of up to $1 trillion, a figure larger than recent
estimates, and analysts say possible scenarios include the Fed
starting at $80 billion to $100 billion a month but leaving
itself the option to do more. [FED/R]
 ""We think $500 billion over six months but they may not put
a timeframe to it,"" said Robert Ryan, FX strategist at BNP
Paribas in Singapore.
 Due at 1230 GMT, the GDP report is expected to show the
world's biggest economy grew 2.0 percent in the third quarter.
 ""U.S. GDP is highly unlikely to be a game-changer unless it
deviates significantly from forecasts which could cause
investors to alter their estimates of QE from the Fed,"" said
Paul Mackel, director of currency strategy at HSBC.
 The euro slipped 0.9 percent to $1.3811 . The dollar
index <.DXY> rose 0.5 percent to 77.659 after falling 1.1
percent the previous day.
 ""There is some dollar position squaring going on related to
the FOMC with some of our clients starting to feel that the Fed
may disappoint market expectations,"" said Oliveri at UBS.

 (Adds analyst comments)
 By Toni Vorobyova
 MOSCOW, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank as expected
kept interest rates on hold on Friday and said accommodative
policy could stay in place in coming months given risks to the
economic recovery and a more subdued inflation outlook.
 Russia's economy is recovering from its worst recession in
15 years and is expected to grow around 4 percent this year
after shrinking nearly 8 percent in 2009. But latest data shows
risks remain, with still-fragile domestic demand illustrated by
weak September retail sales.
 ""The Bank of Russia considers it possible to retain
accommodative monetary policy in coming months in order to
support internal growth factors,"" the bank said in a statement,
broadly echoing the tone from last month's meeting.
 ""The weakening in consumer demand and the uncertainty over
the prospects of the external economic situation create
additional risks for economic growth,"" it said.
 Analysts polled by Reuters expect the benchmark refinancing
rate will not be raised from the current 7.75 percent until the
start of 2011.
 ""The comments (from the central bank) are very much in line
with what was expected,"" said Julia Tsepliaeva, chief economist
for Russia and CIS at BNP Paribas, who does not expect interest
rate hikes to start until next March.
 
 MORE FLEXIBLE ROUBLE
 Inflation -- which spiked in the summer as the worst drought
in decades killed a third of the harvest -- is expected to ease
to 0.6 percent in October from September's seven-month high of
0.8 percent, reducing the need for near term rate hikes.
 ""This signals an easing of inflation expectations,"" the
central bank said.
 ""Inflation risks determined by monetary conditions currently
remain at an acceptable level and the increase in the
flexibility of the rouble exchange rate together with the
planned budget deficit reduction ... may contribute to creating
the conditions for reducing such risks"".
 The central bank widened the rouble floating trading band
earlier this month and scrapped a fixed exchange rate corridor.
It said more steps would follow as it gradually shifts towards
targeting inflation rather than the currency.
 ""The passage on the exchange rate is effectively a repeat
that the central bank plans to reduce its presence in the
market, and thus inflation risks will be less,"" said Tsepliaeva
at BNP.
 She added that such comments tend to fuel the prevailing
market trend, which at the moment is for a weaker rouble. The
rouble extended losses on Friday, closing in on its 2010 low
against the dollar.
 ""In the longer term, though, I belive in a stronger rouble,""
Tsepliaeva said, adding that this would be supported by Russia's
privatisation campaign, strong oil prices and an expected
resumption of capital inflows.

 COPENHAGEN, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Danish freight forwarder DSV
disappointed investors with a smaller-than-expected upgrade to
its 2010 outlook after reporting more than threefold rise in
third quarter-pretax profit due boosted by its Air & Sea
division.
 DSV's shares initially tumbled more than 7 percent to a
five-week low but had trimmed losses to 3.56 percent at 108.40
Danish crowns by 0954 GMT, underperforming a 1.15 percent fall
in the Copenhagen bourse's blue chip index.
 ""The upgrade is too small,"" said Amagerbanken head of equity
sales Soren Sorensen. ""I think some analysts will have to
downgrade their expectations of the company this year.""
 DSV said the upgrade in outlook for 2010 was due to rising
activity in the first nine months of the year.
 The company said its results were helped by growth in its
Air & Sea division, which reported a 50 percent rise in
third-quarter revenue, and cost control.
 The company revised its revenue guidance upwards to between
42 billion to 43 billion Danish crowns ($7.82 billion) from an
earlier expected 41 billion to 43 billion crowns and its
forecast for earnings before interest, taxes and amortisation
(EBITA) to between 2.15 billion and 2.25 billion crowns from
 Chief Executive Jens Bjorn Andersen said DSV expected growth
to slow down but stabilise.
 ""We expect the development we have seen in the first three
quarters of the year to continue,"" Andersen told Reuters.
2.0 billion to 2.2 billion crowns.
 He said he saw global trade developing favourably and DSV
was experiencing high growth primarily in the Far East but also
in countries like Sweden and Germany.
 
 NO DOUBLE-DIP
 Last week, Swiss-listed peer Kuehne & Nagel said it expected
a strong finish to the year and raised its airfreight volumes
forecast, in a sign that the world trade recovery is set to
continue.
 Andersen said he did not believe the world would see a
double-dip recession.
 ""And even if we did see a double-dip, we feel we would be
well positioned to face it,"" he said.
 Analysts said the group seemed to have managed to turn
around its Road division business in countries that had been
challenging for it.
 ""Fundamentally, all countries (in the Road division)
delivered profits in the third quarter, which shows a successful
turnaround of problematic countries such as Germany, France and
Spain,"" said ING analyst, Axel Funhoff.
 DSV said the Road division expected a small profit in those
three countries. A profit in Germany would be the first in six
years for DSV.
 The group said it was adjusting its strategy, and would
focus on organic growth and returning capital to shareholders
through share buy-backs and dividends.
 The change of strategy would also mean that large
acquisitions were now unlikely.
 DSV said it had reduced debt to a desired level, enabling it
to launch a share buyback of up to 600 million crowns.
Pretax profit in the third quarter rose 207 percent to 461
million Danish crowns in the three months to the end of
September, missing a mean estimate of 489 million crowns in a
Reuters poll of analysts.

 European shares fell 0.2 percent with London's FTSE 100
index dropping 0.1 percent and German's DAX easing 0.2 percent.
U.S. stock index futures were down about 0.3 percent.
 Many asset markets have hardly moved this week, but the
modest price action belies the tense jostling for positioning
ahead of a storm of events and economic data next week that
could cause volatility to spike and determine investors'
tolerance of risk, including potential new bond purchases by
the Fed.
 U.S. gross domestic data for the third quarter is due later
in the day, though it will probably be viewed as an indicator
of just how much QE2, what the market has dubbed a new Fed
money-printing program, will be -- a question that has consumed
traders and investors since September.
 GDP growth is expected to come in at 2 percent on an
annualised basis, a Reuters poll showed.
 ""While such acceleration of growth would make QE2 seem less
urgent on the surface, core PCE price data will be more
important, and if it shows a slowdown, the market will likely
increase expectations of the amount of Treasuries the Fed will
buy,"" Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior strategist with Credit Agricole
CIB in Hong Kong, said in a note.
 SHARP DECLINES
 Until the outcome of the Fed meeting, investors were
finding fewer reasons to hold on to equities.
 Japan's Nikkei share average fell 1.8 percent to a 1-month
low as the yen strengthened broadly and equity futures were
sold aggressively on a break of key chart levels.
 Electronics makers were under fire after Sharp Corp, whose
shares were down 5.8 percent, cut its full-year earnings
forecast on reduced demand for flat-screen televisions.
 A drop in demand for consumer electronics also stung
Samsung Electronics Co, which saw its stock fall 2.5 percent
after the world's top producer of TVs and flat screens said a
supply glut will weigh on memory chip prices and LCD prices
will keep falling in coming months.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan slipped
0.7 percent, though remained in a narrow range carved out this
month.
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was down 0.9 percent, weighed
down the most by China Life after disappointing quarterly
results pulled down other insurers.
 Bucking the trend, AIA Group Ltd shares rocketed 17 percent
in an eye-opening market debut on Friday following its record
Hong Kong initial public offering last week, accounting for
about 40 percent of the day's turnover in Hong Kong.
 A common reason cited by electronics exporters for their
grim outlooks is domestic currency appreciation, a subject that
will dominate a Group of 20 leaders meeting next month.
 YEN GAINS
 The dollar fell 0.4 percent against the yen to 80.65 yen,
the result mostly of spillover from Japanese currency strength
against other currencies. It was getting closer to an all-time
low of 79.75 yen.
 The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.3895 after a 1.2 percent
jump overnight. The euro had trouble breaking above a technical
obstacle around $1.3950, leading some traders to take profits.
 The dollar index, a measure of the dollar's performance
against a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.2
percent on the day and basically flat on the week.
 The index is down 6.3 percent since September, when
expectations grew the Fed would embark on a path to
quantitative easing, basically printing money to buy assets and
flood the financial system with cash.
 In a sign of increasing caution among investors ahead of
early November events -- including congressional U.S.
elections, a Federal Reserve policy meeting and a G20 summit --
money market funds absorbed a 14-week high of $20.2 billion of
new cash in the week ended Oct. 27, EPFR Global said in a note.
 Commodities prices, which have been moving sharply in the
opposite direction of the dollar for the past few months, were
generally under pressure as the dollar held its ground.
 Gold was down 0.1 percent to $1,341.66 on ounce, having now
slid 2 percent since hitting a record high two weeks ago.
 Oil futures were down 0.5 percent to $81.75 a barrel, still
up $10 since September.
 ""We still think the U.S. dollar is going to come under
severe pressure, so we'll see strengthening commodities prices
and that should help our miners,"" said Patersons Securities
dealer Martin Angel in Australia.

 * Equities weighting hits 88.9 pct, highest since poll began
 * Funds suggest more exposure to financials, energy stocks
 * Liquidity to push index higher; market faces policy risks
 By David Lin and Jason Subler
 SHANGHAI, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Mutual funds in China have
raised their recommended equity weighting to a record high,
betting ample liquidity at home and abroad will push stock prices
higher, the latest monthly Reuters poll of fund managers shows.
 However, the stock market still faces policy risks because if
inflation spirals out of control, the government could take
tougher measures to tighten liquidity, some fund managers said.
 The suggested equity weighting over the next three months
rose to 88.9 percent, the highest level since the poll was
initiated in 2007, from 83.6 percent last month, according to the
poll of nine China-based funds taken between Oct. 22 and Oct. 29.
 Suggested allocations for bonds were cut to a record low of
2.4 percent, from 3.1 percent last month, while exposure to cash
was slashed to a two-year low of 8.7 percent, from 13.3 percent a
month earlier.
 China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> staged an
unexpectedly strong rally in October, having jumped nearly 12
percent so far this month, on expectations that fresh monetary
easing by the Federal Reserve would flood the global financial
system with liquidity.
 A Shanghai-based fund manager said that ample liquidity
available to flow to stocks -- supplemented by hot money inflows
betting on yuan appreciation and by speculators fleeing a
tightly-regulated real estate market -- will continue to push up
asset prices over the next month, despite threats of further
tightening measures such as another interest rate increase.
 Fund managers expected the benchmark index to range between
2,900 and 3,500 points in the next three months, compared with
the previous poll's range of 2,500 to 2,900 points. On average,
they project the index to reach 3,246 points by the end of
January.
 Within an equities portfolio, the suggested weighting for
financial shares was raised to 13.9 percent from 10.3 percent a
month earlier, while those for metal and energy stocks rose by
2.1 and 3.9 percentage points respectively, to 8.9 percent and
10.6 percent.
 The suggested allocation for consumer stocks was cut sharply
to 22.7 percent from last month's 31.4 percent, although it
remains the most popular sector in fund managers' portfolios.
 By early afternoon on Friday, the main stock index was down
0.7 percent at 2,970 points, as the market appears to be pausing
for a rest following the rapid rebound earlier in the month.

 By Gilbert Kreijger
 AMSTERDAM, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Dutch staffing firm USG People
NV expects more growth in its European business, including in
its main domestic market, as demand for workers spreads to more
white-collar sectors.
 The staffing sector is seen as a barometer of economic
health, and in the face of a fragile recovery firms are hiring
more temporary staff, including in sectors which tend to pick up
later in the cycle such as IT, accounting and administration.
 Economic uncertainty supported a profit rise at rival
Manpower last week, while Dutch rival Randstad has said growth
was expanding to more sectors and that permanent job placements
were increasing.
 Employment has risen in major western European economies,
especially in Germany, where exports have helped push the
jobless level to its lowest in 18 years.
 Macroeconomic data in Europe's major economies of Germany,
France and Britain this week boosted hopes the region's economy
will stay resilient through the final quarter of this year and
sustain employment.
 ""I think the recovery is durable unless something terrible
happens on the macroeconomic front,"" USG Chief Executive Rob
Zandbergen told Reuters on Friday.
 Demand for temporary staff had spread from manufacturing to
office jobs such as call centre workers, engineers and IT
experts, said Zandbergen, head of Europe's fourth-largest
staffing firm by revenue after Adecco, Randstad and Manpower.
 Uncertainty was helping push up demand for workers but
companies also increasingly hired more permanent employees, said
Zandbergen, who expected growth to continue in all countries.
 The company will resume paying a dividend after halting it
in 2009 when it booked a net loss.
 USG's Dutch market, where it makes 39 percent of sales,
started growing again in September and October despite a 4
percent revenue fall over the July-to-September period compared
to the same quarter last year, the company said.
 Its Dutch sales had been falling since the third quarter of
2008, the height of the credit crisis.
 Third-quarter earnings before interest, tax and amortisation
costs, excluding incidental items (recurring EBITA), were 33
million euros ($45.8 million), beating the mean estimate of 31.6
million in a Reuters poll of banks and brokerages.
 Dutch rival temp agency Brunel will report third-quarter
earnings on Nov. 2.

 * Trip comes after period of U.S.-China tension
 * U.S. launching formal participation in East Asia summit
(Adds more Clinton quotes, paragraph 15)
 By Arshad Mohammed
 HONOLULU, Oct 28 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton denied on Thursday the United States was
seeking to contain China as she began a two-week trip to an
Asia-Pacific region rattled by recent Chinese assertiveness.
 Washington and Beijing have clashed this year over issues
including the value of China's currency, U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan and U.S. President Barack Obama's February meeting with
the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader.
 China's relations with its neighbors have also been
strained by territorial disputes -- notably with Japan -- but
also with Southeast Asian nations that have competing claims
over the South China Sea.
 The top U.S. diplomat, starting a trip to seven
Asia-Pacific nations including China, sought to strike a
balance between the U.S. desire to work with Beijing and its
concerns about some Chinese policies.
 ""The relationship between China and the United States is
complex and of enormous consequence and we are committed to
getting it right,"" Clinton said in a speech on U.S.
Asia-Pacific policy delivered in Honolulu.
 ""There are some in both countries who believe that China's
interests and ours are fundamentally at odds. They apply a
zero-sum calculation ... so whenever one of us succeeds, the
other must fail,"" she said. ""But that is not our view.""
 While saying the two nations work together on many issues,
Clinton also alluded to their many differences, including U.S.
desires to see the Chinese currency appreciate as well as U.S.
criticism of China's human rights record.
 ""There are also many in China who still believe that the
U.S. is bent on containing China and I would simply point out
that since the beginning of our diplomatic relations, China has
experienced breathtaking growth and development,"" she said.
 ""This is due, of course, to the hard work of the Chinese
people. But U.S. policy has consistently -- through Republican
and Democratic administrations and Congresses -- supported this
goal since the 1970s,"" she said.
 Clinton's trip began on Wednesday with a stop in Hawaii to
meet Japan's foreign minister. On Friday, she is in Vietnam for
the East Asia summit and then heads to Cambodia, Malaysia,
Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and Australia.
 While China was not originally on her itinerary, the State
Department added a last-minute detour to China's Hainan Island
on Saturday so Clinton could meet Chinese State Councilor Dai
Bingguo, a key figure in managing the strained U.S.-China
relationship who will not attend the summit in Hanoi.
 SEEKING COOPERATIVE SOLUTIONS
 Sino-Japanese relations have been on edge since last month
after Japan detained a Chinese trawler captain whose boat
collided with Japanese patrol ships near the disputed islands
-- called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China.
 Reports that China had curtailed exports of so-called rare
earth minerals, vital for the production of high-tech goods, to
Japan following the dispute have rattled policy-makers and
markets fearing a scarcity of the commodities.
 Clinton's speech made no reference to that dispute, but she
made clear the U.S. view that China and its neighbors should
work cooperatively to resolve their territorial disputes.
 ""Military buildups matched with ongoing territorial
disputes create anxieties that reverberate,"" she said, adding,
""We are encouraged by China's recent steps to enter discussions
with ASEAN about a more formal, binding code of conduct"" over
the South China Sea.
 In Hanoi in July, Clinton signaled new U.S. engagement in
the South China Sea issue, emphasizing that Washington believed
territorial disputes in the region had global implications
because of its role as a trade and shipping crossroads and
potentially rich source of natural resources.
 Built around this week's East Asia Summit in Hanoi,
Clinton's trip is designed to demonstrate the U.S. commitment
to the region as the United States, and other nations in the
region, grapple with China's economic and military rise.
 ""There are some who say that this long legacy of American
leadership in Asia Pacific is coming to a close -- that we are
not here to stay. I say look at our record. It tells a very
different story,"" Clinton said. ""We are focused on a distant
time horizon -- one that stretches out for decades to come.""

 * Dlr slips towards 80.41 yen 15-year low, 79.75 record low
 * Main focus still on FOMC and likely QE next week
 By Masayuki Kitano and Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The dollar fell within sight of its
1995 record low on Friday as the yen rose broadly and pushed down
the euro and higher-yielders, with trade made choppy by month-end
business but still in ranges ahead of a Federal Reserve decision
on easing.
 The euro fell 0.7 percent and the Australian dollar 0.6
percent against the yen, and the European currency triggered sell
orders as it headed down to 112.00 yen, with more sell stops
expected below that threshold.
 Talk of month-end yen demand from Japanese exporters as well
as dollar selling by overseas hedge funds who had bought the pair
the day before helped push the Japanese currency nearer to
Monday's 15-year peak of 80.41 yen per dollar and within a yen of
its record trough of 79.75 set in 1995.
 But the major currencies were broadly in the ranges that have
confined them in the past few weeks as investors wait to see if
the Fed says next week that it will resume quantitative easing as
many expect, and if so, in what size and over what time horizon.
 ""Overall the moves seem to be of the position unwinding
variety,"" said a trader for a Japanese brokerage house.
 Japanese shares also fell, with the benchmark Nikkei average
down 1.8 percent, making some speculate this could temper the
dollar's fall as the market might become cautious of Japanese
yen-selling intervention.
 A falling share market is seen as one of the conditions which
could prod Japanese authorities to intervene, after they did so
in September to counter a push higher in the yen.
 Others felt intervention was unlikely unless the dollar fell
through 80.00 yen, but one trader expected option-related dollar
buying could emerge around 80.00.
 ""There is also wariness about intervention, so I don't
imagine that the dollar will suddenly break below 80.00,"" he
said.
 The dollar fell 0.6 percent to 80.53 yen and the euro dropped
0.7 percent to 112.05 yen.
 The Australian dollar fell 0.6 percent to 78.72 yen but was
steady at $0.9773. A trader in Australia reported selling in the
yen crosses seemed to be coming out of Tokyo.
 IT'S STILL THE FED
 The main market focus remains what the Fed decides at its
meeting on Nov.2-3, with U.S. growth data later on Friday
potentially feeding into the debate over how big Fed asset-buying
should be this time around.
 Due at 1230 GMT, the GDP report is expected to show the
world's biggest economy grew 2.0 percent in the third quarter.
While this would be too subdued to alter the expectation there
will be further Fed stimulus, some dealers are nervous in case
the data repeats a big upside surprise in UK GDP which sent
sterling flying on reduced expectations of easing there.
 Others, though, said the data was unlikely to give currencies
new direction, with the mood swings of the past few sessions
stemming from uncertainty about how big U.S. QE could be.
 A New York Fed survey of dealers and investors included
scenarios of up to $1 trillion, a figure larger than recent
estimates, and analysts say possible scenarios include the Fed
starting at $80 billion to $100 billion a month but leaving
itself the option to do more.
 ""We think $500 billion over six months but they may not put a
timeframe to it,"" said Robert Ryan, FX strategist at BNP Paribas
in Singapore.
 ""At the end of the day, it may still end up being a trillion
but the announcement will be something that allows them to say as
long as it looks warranted they'll continue to do it - so the
support and commitment is there.""
 The dollar has shed about 6 percent against major currencies
in the past two months, and some analysts say it's due for a rally
once the Fed reveals its easing plans.
 Others say its performance against the euro at least will
depend to some extent on how much emerging economies recycle
dollar reserves generated by intervention into euros.
 The euro slipped 0.2 percent to $1.3902. The dollar index,
which tracks the greenback's performance against six major
currencies, was steady at 77.333 after falling 1.1 percent on
Thursday, its biggest one-day percentage fall for a week.

 TOKYO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The dollar fell towards a 15-year

and higher-yielders, with trade made choppy by month-end business
but still in ranges ahead of a Federal Reserve decision on

 A falling share market is seen as one of the conditions which

 There was speculation, however, that there might be stop-loss
sell orders below the 80.41 yen level, where a break would
heighten chances of an eventual test of the dollar's postwar
record low of 79.75 yen.
 The dollar fell 0.6 percent to 80.56 yen but edged up against
the euro. The euro was 0.2 percent lower at $1.3902, testing
support in that region, and was 0.7 percent down at 112.05 yen.
 The Australian dollar fell 0.6 percent to 78.72 yen but was
steady at $0.9773.

 HONG KONG, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Japan on Friday led Asian

could cause volatility to spike and determine investors'
tolerance of risk, including potential new bond purchases by
the Fed.
 U.S. gross domestic data for the third quarter is due later
in the day, though it will probably be viewed as an indicator
of just how much QE2, what the market has dubbed a new Fed
money-printing program, will be -- a question that has consumed
traders and investors since September.
 GDP growth is expected to come in at 2 percent on an
annualised basis, a Reuters poll showed.
 ""While such acceleration of growth would make QE2 seem less
urgent on the surface, core PCE price data will be more
important, and if it shows a slowdown, the market will likely
increase expectations of the amount of Treasuries the Fed will
buy,"" Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior strategist with Credit Agricole
CIB in Hong Kong, said in a note.
 SHARP DECLINES
 Until the outcome of the Fed meeting, investors were
finding fewer reasons to hold on to equities.
 Japan's Nikkei share average <.N225> fell 1.8 percent to a
1-month low as the yen strengthened broadly and equity futures
were sold aggressively on a break of key chart levels.
 Electronics makers were under fire after Sharp Corp
<6753.T>, whose shares were down 5.8 percent, cut its full-year
earnings forecast on reduced demand for flat-screen
televisions.
 A drop in demand for consumer electronics also stung
Samsung Electronics Co <005930.KS>, which saw its stock fall
2.5 percent after the world's top producer of TVs and flat
screens said a supply glut will weigh on memory chip prices and
LCD prices will keep falling in coming months. [ID:nTOE69Q079]
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan slipped
0.7 percent <.MIAPJ0000PUS>, though remained in a narrow range
carved out this month.
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was down 0.9 percent <.HSI>,
weighed down the most by China Life <2628.HK> after
disappointing quarterly results pulled down other insurers.
 Bucking the trend, AIA Group Ltd <1299.HK> shares rocketed
17 percent in an eye-opening market debut on Friday following
its record Hong Kong initial public offering last week,
accounting for about 40 percent of the day's turnover in Hong
Kong. [ID:nTOE69S06P]
 A common reason cited by electronics exporters for their
grim outlooks is domestic currency appreciation, a subject that
will dominate a Group of 20 leaders meeting next month.
 YEN GAINS
 The dollar fell 0.4 percent against the yen  to 80.65
yen, the result mostly of spillover from Japanese currency
strength against other currencies. It was getting closer to an
all-time low of 79.75 yen.
 The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.3895  after a 1.2
percent jump overnight. The euro had trouble breaking above a
technical obstacle around $1.3950, leading some traders to take
profits.
 The dollar index <=USD>, a measure of the dollar's
performance against a basket of six other major currencies, was
up 0.2 percent on the day and basically flat on the week.
 The index is down 6.3 percent since September, when
expectations grew the Fed would embark on a path to
quantitative easing, basically printing money to buy assets and
flood the financial system with cash.
 In a sign of increasing caution among investors ahead of
early November events -- including congressional U.S.
elections, a Federal Reserve policy meeting and a G20 summit --
money market funds absorbed a 14-week high of $20.2 billion of
new cash in the week ended Oct. 27, EPFR Global said in a note.
 Commodities prices, which have been moving sharply in the
opposite direction of the dollar for the past few months, were
generally under pressure as the dollar held its ground.
 Gold was down 0.1 percent to $1,341.66 on ounce ,
having now slid 2 percent since hitting a record high two weeks
ago.
 Oil futures were down 0.5 percent to $81.75 a barrel
, still up $10 since September.
 ""We still think the U.S. dollar is going to come under
severe pressure, so we'll see strengthening commodities prices
and that should help our miners,"" said Patersons Securities
dealer Martin Angel in Australia.

 BEIJING, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Limited quotas to export rare
earths from China has driven a secondary market where the price
of the permits are higher than the price of the minerals
themselves, a Chinese industry expert told Reuters.
 China sharply cut quotas to export rare earths in the
second half of this year, after leaving them unchanged in the
first half, catching international traders off-guard. Only a
few authorized exporters still have quotas left for shipment.
 The shortage -- and cost -- of quotas has helped drive
smuggling, said Tiger Pan, managing director of Beijing-based
metals pricing service Asian Metal, in an interview with
Reuters Insider.
 Smuggled outflows could exceed 30,000 tonnes this year, he
said. He said the Ministry of Commerce estimates 20,000 tonnes
of rare earth material were smuggled out of China in 2008.
 That would augment legal supplies exported through quotas,
which were cut to about 30,000 tonnes in 2010 from about 50,000
tonnes in 2009.
 ""The price of an export permit used to be cheap, but now
it's really expensive -- expensive enough that some companies
would rather sell their quotas, because you can make more than
by exporting,"" Pan said.
 Quota prices for some rare earths elements have risen to
about 200,000- 300,000 yuan ($29,910 -$44,870) a tonne, Pan
said - exceeding the price of the element itself in the
domestic market by ten times.
 ""Of course, this is against government regulations. The
permit is non-transferrable. But actually, it becomes money. So
if I want to earn a bit of money, I'll sell to you, I won't
export, you export.""
 The reduction in quotas and increased efforts against
smuggling by Chinese customs led to delays in shipping rare
earths from China over the past several weeks.
 The New York Times reported in September, citing unnamed
sources, that China had imposed an embargo on rare earths
shipments to Japan, in retaliation for Japan's arrest of a
Chinese ship captain after a collision in disputed waters. On
Friday, the Times reported that embargo was lifted, again
citing unnamed sources.
 Chinese officials have repeatedly denied any unilateral
embargo, and trading sources had not independently confirmed
that there was one.

(Adds close of U.S. markets)
 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose despite
Wall Street's mixed finish and the dollar's slide on Thursday
as investors pulled back before expected upheaval from next
week's U.S. elections and the likelihood of more monetary
easing.
 Oil prices ended higher, supported by an unexpected drop
in new U.S. jobless claims to a three-month low and a dollar
that weakened over rising worries about the extent of a second
round of stimulus by the U.S. Federal Reserve next week. For
details see: [ID:nN28128308]
 Trading in Tokyo was poised to open near break-even, with
the December futures contract that trades in Chicago for the
Nikkei 225 <0#NK:> off 5 points at 9,350.
 During Thursday's trading, investors shied away from big
bets ahead of the two-day Fed meeting that will end on this
coming Wednesday.
 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has asked market
participants about their expectations for further easing as
part of its regular survey prior to Fed meetings, a person
familiar with the survey said. [ID:nN28172214]
 A Reuters poll of 17 primary dealers on Wednesday showed
forecasts on the size of a renewed Fed program ranging widely
between $250 billion and $2 trillion, with most expecting
purchases of between $80 billion and $100 billion a month.
[FED/R]
 The drop in claims for new unemployment benefits gave U.S.
equities an early gain as did a weak dollar, but the inverse
relationship between the U.S. currency and stocks appeared to
break down. Mixed earnings also added to the choppy action.
[ID:nN28118907] [ID:nLDE69R17T]
 STALLING FOR TIME
 Next week could bring significant shifts in both monetary
policy and legislative direction, leading investors to largely
disregard earnings news and economic reports.
 ""Perhaps this is going to be a 'buy the rumor, sell the
news' kind of deal where we have had the rally in anticipation
of all these things,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market
strategist, at Federated Investors in New York.
 ""Now that we are about to cross the threshold, maybe we
are getting a little toppy here and we need to consolidate
some of those gains.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> slipped 12.33
points, or 0.11 percent, to end at 11,113.95. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> edged up 1.33 points, or 0.11 percent,
to 1,183.78. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> rose 4.11
points, or 0.16 percent, to close at 2,507.37.
 European shares ended higher on upbeat earnings results,
helping lift MSCI's all-country world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS> 0.6 percent.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan rose
0.7 percent <.MIAPJ0000PUS> after a nearly 2 percent slide the
day before. Japan's Nikkei stock average <.N225>, which was
spared the sell-off, dipped 0.2 percent to end at 9,366.03, a
six-week low.
 The euro  gained 1.15 percent at $1.3926 as the
dollar slipped. A recent move to trim extreme short dollar
positions amid speculation the Fed will announce plans to buy
more assets next week, also slowed. [ID:nN28118050]
 The dollar tumbled against a basket of major currencies,
with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> down 1.10 percent at
77.290.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  dropped 0.86
percent to 80.99.

 Gold futures for December delivery  climbed $19.90,

the NYMEX.
 Crude oil rose in a seesaw session. U.S. crude for
December delivery  rose 24 cents to settle at $82.18 a
barrel, after dropping earlier to $81.50. It has gained in
four of the last five sessions.
 ICE December Brent crude  added 43 cents to end at
$83.59.
 ""The market looks somewhat directionless until the
election and the Federal Reserve details next week are known,""
said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.
 A recent rise in yields and talk of aggressive
quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve drove buyers to
U.S. Treasuries and bolstered demand in an auction of
seven-year Treasury notes. [ID:nN28570645]
 Ten-year yields above 2.70 percent attracted buyers. The
10-year Treasury note  rose 18/32 in price to yield
2.66 percent, down from 2.72 percent late on Wednesday.

1098,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2010 05:08PM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-EU to impose seal ban after court ends delay," * EU court ends suspension of ban on seal products
 * Applicants submitted insufficient proof of emergency
 * Canada says it is disappointed by court decision
(Adds Canadian reaction, background)
 BRUSSELS, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The European Union got the
green light on Thursday to close its borders to seal products,
when an EU court decided to impose a ban even though a legal
challenge from Canadian seal hunters is still in progress.
 The EU's General Court -- the second-highest court in the
27-state bloc -- said there was no need to delay the ban for
the duration of court proceedings and added it had not seen
enough evidence that the ban would damage seal hunting
communities.
 Seal hunters and processing firms from Canada, Norway and
Greenland secured a temporary delay in the ban this summer,
saying it would slash incomes in traditional Inuit communities
and trigger suicides and substance abuse.
 But they presented too little paperwork to prove their
current financial situation, future income losses or access to
unemployment benefits, the court ruling said.
 ""In submitting that the prohibition on trade ... would be
likely to give rise to an increase to the suicide rate and
substance abuse among young Inuit, the applicants are simply
making mere general and abstract assertions,"" the ruling said.
 ""It follows ... that the applicants have not proved the
existence of circumstances giving rise to urgency such as to
justify the suspension,"" it ruled.
 In Ottawa, Canadian Fisheries Minister Gail Shea said she
was disappointed by the court decision.
 ""What we want to do is continue to express our support for
the seal industry here in Canada, to the sealers on our coasts
and in the North,"" she told reporters.
 The International Fund for Animal Welfare praised the
decision and insisted the EU ban would exempt Inuit-derived
seal products.
 The court ruling raises the stakes in an EU trade dispute
with Canada, even as the two sides pursue free trade talks.
 The EU ban, approved last year and originally due to take
effect in August, triggered a Canadian government challenge at
the World Trade Organization and a separate suit by seal
hunters at the EU's General Court this summer.
 Canada says the ban, affecting around 4.2 million euros
($5.6 million) of business, is based on false information and
violates the EU's trade obligations.
 The indigenous Inuit people of Canada's North say an
exemption for seal products derived from traditional hunts is
mere rhetoric that will not be honored.
 Canada's main seal hunt takes place in March and April on
ice floes off the Atlantic Coast and in the Gulf of St.
Lawrence. The seals are usually shot, or bludgeoned over the
head with a spiked club called a hakapik.
 Seal products include fur for clothing and oil that is used
in vitamin supplements.
 The EU has promised to defend its decision, which it says
does not discriminate against Canada as it prohibits seal
products from other countries as well.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Thursday in
tandem with Treasury yields as investors once again reassessed
how much money the Federal Reserve was likely to commit to a
second round of monetary stimulus when it meets next week.
 The Fed has telegraphed its intent to boost growth by
pumping more money into the economy through direct government
bond purchases, and few if any investors doubt its resolve.
 But investors are far from certain about how much money the
Fed will spend. A New York Federal Reserve survey of dealers
and investors included scenarios of up to $1 trillion, a figure
larger than recent estimates. For details, see
[ID:nLDE69R15M].
 That snapped a two-day dollar rally, pushing the euro to
the upper end of its recent broad range of about $1.3650-$1.40
and pushing U.S. yields down. The more money the U.S. central
bank effectively prints, the more it will push down Treasury
yields and reduce the appeal of dollar-based assets.
 ""The issue is whether the market believes the Fed will
deliver significant quantitative easing over a definitive time
line,"" said Peter Frank, a currency strategist at Societe
Generale in London. ""If they do, the dollar will weaken.""
 The euro rose 1.2 percent to $1.3931 , well off a
$1.3759 session low, while the 10-year Treasury note
 was up 19/32 in price to yield 2.66 percent, down
from 2.72 percent late on Wednesday.
 The dollar fell 0.8 percent to 81.08 yen , with small
stop loss cited by traders in the 80.90 area with bids at 80.60
and 80.40. There are also solid barriers at 80.00.
 Traders shrugged off a Bank of Japan decision to keep
interest rates at zero while holding off on new policy
initiatives. Analysts were still on alert for any dollar move
below 80.41 yen, a 15-year low, for fear Japanese authorities
could repeat last month's intervention to stem yen strength.
 DOLLAR RALLY POSSIBLE
 Wall Street analysts expect the Federal Reserve to buy $80
billion to $100 billion worth of assets per month under a new
program widely expected to be unveiled on Wednesday, according
to a Reuters poll. [FED/R]
 Estimates for how much the Fed will eventually spend varied
from $250 billion to $2 trillion. The market has been scaling
back expectations as the event draws nearer.
 Lingering uncertainty about how the Fed will announce more
QE has increased market volatility, with one-week implied
volatility for euro/dollar  jumping to 15.3 percent on
Thursday from 12.6 percent at the start of the week.
 The dollar has shed 7 percent against major currencies
since September <.DXY>, and some say it's due for a rally once
the Fed reveals its easing plans.
 ""We remain inclined to trade the dollar tactically from the
long side into the Fed meeting based on the idea that
quantitative easing is over-priced,"" said Nomura currency
strategist Jens Nordvig.
 The euro's move to $1.3890 looks like a good opportunity to
reestablish dollar longs, he said.
 A buyer of the Powershares Bullish Dollar Fund, an exchange
traded fund, bought 55,400 March 23 calls at 61 cents each and
105,500 March 24 calls at 34 cents. Both positions are opening
buys and appear to reflect expectations for a dollar rally
through March 2011.
 The euro may also be vulnerable as countries such as
Greece, Portugal and Ireland continue to struggle with strained
public finances. Investors shook off news on Thursday of a
breakdown in Portuguese budget talks, but some said worries
about the banking sector and the region's debt problems could
check the euro's gains.
 The European Central Bank's quarterly Bank Lending Survey
said more banks expect to tighten their credit standards for
corporate loans in the fourth quarter.
 The news could check hawkish ECB intentions to scale back
emergency stimulus measures, said Tom Levinson, a forex
strategist at ING. ""This serves as a warning on what is going
on in the real economy. It's less of a positive for euro but
the real dominant force is still the U.S. story.""

 * Brazil's ALL to troubleshoot, help make changes
 
 By Richard Lough
 NAIROBI, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Egyptian private equity firm
Citadel Capital expects to secure a debt package by early 2011
for its east African railway venture, its managing director told
Reuters on Thursday.
 Karim Sadek told Reuters that Rift Valley Railways (RVR) was
still two years away from delivering a service where cargo
clients would see a ""real difference"" in reliability.
 Revitalisation of the rail network between Kenya and Uganda
is viewed as critical to expanding intra-regional trade. More
than 90 percent of the cargo arriving in Mombasa's port that is
destined for Uganda, south Sudan, Rwanda and Burundi is
transported by road.
 ""We hope to have something in place in terms of complete
financial closing, meaning securing the debt package, by
January,"" Sadek said in an interview. 
 The $280 million capital expenditure programme will be
funded by roughly $160 million in debt, $80 million in new
equity in addition to existing equity and the balance from cash
flows, he said.
 He said RVR had more or less finalised a deal with America
Latina Logistica, a Brazilian holding company that operates
railways in Argentina and Brazil, to troubleshoot and help
implement changes. 
 ""Their role is basically to analyse the problems, which they
have done, and come up with solutions. For example, RVR was
previously a parastatal, so how do you build a merit based
company, how do you run efficient fuel consumption?"" he said.
 
 ""EAT, DRINK AND GO TO WORK""
 Following a legal wrangle earlier this year with feuding RVR
shareholders, Citadel is now the dominant stakeholder with 51
percent via its subsidiary Ambience Ventures.
 Kenya has also invited bids for a separate new high-speed
railway to run along the same route.
 Sadek said Citadel was looking to expand its east African
portfolio with investments in the agriculture and food
processing, microfinance and transport sectors.
 ""People in this part of the world will continue to eat,
drink and go to work. So that is what we will focus on.""
 ""They (sectors) basically have a much bigger market, smaller
margins but the volumes are huge and they are less liable to
external hits unlike real estate, commodities,"" he said.
 On the agriculture and food processing front, Citadel will
target the supply-side rather than retail, he said. 
 ""Stuff like packaging, the glass jars, the plastic. We've
still not identified a specific opportunity ... we're still
scanning,"" he said.

 NEW YORK, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose despite a
slide in U.S. equity markets after upbeat corporate results in
Europe boosted sentiment, while the dollar fell on speculation
of greater-than-expected U.S. monetary easing next week.
 Oil prices initially rose on news of an unexpected drop in
weekly U.S. jobless claims, a positive signal on the health of
the U.S. economy before the Fed's widely anticipated meeting
next week. For details see [ID:nSGE69R0B4]
 Investors shied away from big bets ahead of the two-day Fed
meeting, which will end on Wednesday and is expected to unveil
a new program of monetary easing aimed at lifting asset prices
and increasing growth.
 A New York Federal Reserve survey of dealers and investors

 In the face of the looming Fed statement and U.S. elections
on Tuesday, investors ""may prune some risk and take some

 But oil prices eased, with U.S. light sweet crude oil
 falling 11 cents to $81.83 per barrel.
 In the bond market, doubts about the aggressiveness of the
Fed's plans encouraged some price-cutting this week, pushing
yields high enough to draw buyers back into the market.
 But some of the doubts appeared to dissipate Thursday amid
talk of eventual Fed purchases of up to $1 trillion.
 Ten-year yields above 2.70 percent attracted buyers. The

 * Drop in Treasury yields weighs on U.S. currency
 * Investors ready for next week's Fed meeting
 * 1-week implied vols for euro/dollar rise
 (Updates prices, adds detail, adds comments)
 NEW YORK, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Thursday in
tandem with Treasury yields, driving back to the weaker end of
a well-worn range below $1.40 per euro, on talk Federal Reserve
quantitative easing could be larger than expected.
 A New York Federal Reserve survey of dealers and investors
on the size of the stimulus program included scenarios of up to
$1 trillion, a figure larger than recent estimates.
 The bigger the move by the U.S. central bank to effectively
print money, the more it will push down U.S. Treasury yields
and reduce the attractiveness of dollar-based assets.
 Dollar selling against the euro and other currencies by
reserve managers also sent the U.S. currency lower.
 ""The issue is whether the market believes the Fed will
deliver significant quantitative easing over a definitive time
line,"" said Peter Frank, a currency strategist at Societe
Generale in London. ""If they do, the dollar will weaken.""
 In early New York trade, the euro had risen 0.9 percent on
the day to $1.3898. This helped to push the dollar 1 percent
lower versus a currency basket on the day though it is down
only a marginal 0.6 percent for the year to date.
 The 10-year Treasury note was up 12/32 in price to yield
2.68 percent, down from 2.72 percent late on Wednesday. An
unexpected drop in initial weekly jobless claims on Thursday
capped prices on U.S. Treasury debt though they were still up
from the previous session.
 ""We are getting a little bit of a driver from lower
yields,"" said Joseph Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX
Solutions in Saddle River, New Jersey. ""Lower yields and a
lower dollar go together.""
 NARROWING SPREADS
 Other analysts said the dollar was also weighed down by a
narrowing spread between 10-year U.S. and euro zone government
bonds.
 Euro gains kept it above a one-week low around $1.3734 hit
on electronic trading platform EBS on Wednesday, even as debt
concerns in Ireland and Greece and a breakdown in budget talks
in Portugal highlighted problems facing periphery euro zone
countries.
 Frank said support for the euro despite sovereign debt
issues illustrated the resilience of the single currency, and
that he expected it to rise back above $1.40 in the near term.
 But worries about the banking sector and the region's debt
problems could check the euro's gains. The European Central
Bank's quarterly Bank Lending Survey said more banks expect to
tighten their credit standards for corporate loans in Q4. 
 The news could check hawkish ECB intentions to scale back
emergency stimulus measures, said Tom Levinson, a forex
strategist at ING. ""This serves as a warning on what is going
on in the real economy. It's less of a positive for euro but
the real dominant force is still the U.S. story.""
 U.S. STORY
 Wall Street analysts expect the Federal Reserve to buy $80
billion to $100 billion worth of assets per month under a new
programme widely expected to be unveiled on Nov. 3, according
to a Reuters poll.
 Estimates for how much the Fed will eventually spend varied
from $250 billion to $2 trillion. The market has been scaling
back expectations as the event draws nearer.
 Lingering uncertainty about how the Fed will announce more
QE has increased market volatility, with one-week implied
volatility for euro/dollar jumping to 15.3 percent on Thursday
from 12.6 percent at the start of the week. Against the
yen, the dollar fell 0.9 percent to 80.93 yen. Small stop loss
were cited by traders in the 80.90 area with bids at 80.60 and
80.40. There are also solid 80.00 barriers.
The Japanese currency showed little reaction to a Bank of
Japan decision to keep interest rates virtually at zero while
holding off from new policy initiatives.
 At current levels the dollar is holding above a 15-year low
of 80.41 yen hit earlier this week on EBS, but investors remain
vigilant for any yen-weakening intervention after authorities
entered the market last month.
 Elsewhere, a buyer of the Powershares Bullish Dollar Fund,
an exchange traded fund, bought 55,400 March 23 calls at 61
cents each and 105,500 March 24 calls at 34 cents. Both
positions are opening buys and appear to reflect expectations
for a dollar rally through March 2011.

 * Their seventh meeting a sign of big push to improve ties
 * Obama to discuss economy, trade, security, human rights
(Adds quotes, details, background)
 By Alister Bull
 WASHINGTON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama
and Chinese President Hu Jintao will discuss the global
economy, trade, North Korea, Iran and human rights among other
issues when they meet on Nov. 11 on the sidelines of the G20
summit in Seoul, the White House said on Thursday.
 The United States wants China to allow its yuan currency
value to rise to aid U.S. exports, and this issue is expected
to be a central part of the G20 summit of advanced and emerging
economic powers in South Korea.
 But the foreign exchange issue was only indirectly
addressed during the briefing by Obama aides ahead of his
10-day trip to Asia early next month.
 The meeting will be Obama's seventh with Hu, which the
White House said was unprecedented for a U.S. leader and showed
how much importance the administration placed on improving ties
between the two powerful rivals.
 ""We expect this meeting to build on the cooperation that
we've established in the 21 months since President Obama took
office,"" White House senior director for Asian affairs Jeff
Bader told reporters.
 The White House said Hu would visit the United States early
next year. The trip had been announced, but without specifics
on timing.
 Bader said China had been helpful in securing tough United
Nations sanctions earlier this year against Iran over its
nuclear program, which Washington and other western powers say
is designed to acquire the ability to build a nuclear bomb - a
charge Tehran rejects.
 REALISTIC ASSESSMENT
 ""On China, since day one, we've had a clear-eyed and
realistic assessment of what can be done in the China
relationship,"" Bader said.
 He said the U.S. strategy on China focused on broadening
areas of cooperation, increasing stability in Asia and ensuring
that China abide by international norms and laws.
 In broadening cooperation, Bader cited Iran, as well as the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank, where China is set
to gain more influence through reforms.
 He said increasing stability in Asia was the reason for
Obama visiting India, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan during
his trip, since all four are democracies with which Washington
has a partnership or historic alliance.
 Touring the four countries while skipping China, which
Obama visited last year, reminds Beijing that the United States
has strong friends in the region, analysts say.
 On meeting international norms and laws, Bader cited the
currency issue as well as the recent increase in tensions in
the South China Sea.
 ""This relationship has never been an easy relationship,
never been a relationship where everything has been on the
positive side of the ledger,"" Bader said.

1111,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2010 12:16PM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Key emerging economies must let currencies rise - IMF," (Adds details)
 WASHINGTON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Key emerging economies
running trade surpluses must ""begin in earnest"" to allow their
currencies to appreciate to help rebalance global demand, the
International Monetary Fund urged on Thursday.
 The IMF said in a surveillance note to G20 leading
economies that trade imbalances would not correct themselves
and required policies to smooth the distortions creating large
surpluses in some countries and big deficits in others.
 ""In the absence of policies targeting the elimination of
underlying distortions, global imbalances will continue to
widen, threatening growth prospects in both advanced and
emerging economies,"" the IMF said.
 The IMF note was presented at a meeting of G20 finance
ministers in Gyeongju, South Korea last week, ahead of a G20
leaders summit in Seoul on Nov. 11-12.
 The IMF said the Chinese yuan  remained substantially
undervalued, while the U.S. dollar was on the ""strong side.""
Meanwhile, exchange rates were broadly in line with
fundamentals in Japan , the euro zone  and in
Britain , it said.
 The G20 finance ministers agreed on Saturday to shun
competitive currency devaluations but stopped short of setting
targets to reduce trade imbalances. For details, see
[ID:nTOE69M004]
 The United States has accused China of keeping the yuan
artificially weak to promote exports, but Beijing has warned
that a rapid exchange rate shift could unleash disastrous
social turmoil in China.
 Emerging market countries have complained that super-loose
monetary policy in slow-growing advanced economies, like the
U.S., have caused a surge in money into their economies,
boosting their currencies and asset prices.
 Brazil and Thailand have responded by introducing controls
on capital inflows, while other central banks have stepped up
currency interventions, fueling talk of trade wars.
 Given the fragile and uneven global economic recovery, the
IMF said accommodative monetary policy was appropriate in
advanced economies. It warned, however, that negative
spillovers to other economies, particularly emerging economies,
needed to be closely watched and managed.
 The Fund said advanced economies needed to prepare credible
medium-term fiscal consolidation plans that were based on
conservative growth projections, to rein in debt. As part of
these plans, spending cuts should begin in 2011, it added.

impact from European sanctions against Iran on its Shah Deniz
gas project, in which Iranian state energy firm NIOC has a
stake, a senior Azeri energy official said on Thursday.
 The EU sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme, launched in
July, aim to block oil and gas investment in Iran and curtail
Tehran's refining and natural gas capability.
 ""This question has not been raised so far,"" Natig Aliyev,
Azerbaijan's minister of industry and energy, told Reuters. He
was accompanying Azeri President Ilham Aliyev on a trip to
Ukraine.
 ""The Iranian company that takes part in the Shah Deniz
project has a status of a so-called 'sleeping partner'. It has a
certain stake for which it pays according to an annual
investment schedule,"" he said.
 ""This issue (of sanctions) has not been raised on any level
yet to be reviewed, discussed or acted upon,"" he added.
 A British government source said earlier this week that
sanctions were unlikely to have any impact on the BP-led Shah
Deniz project.
 Azeri officials said this year that they had sharply raised
the upper end of expectations for potential additional natural
gas output from the Shah Deniz field's second phase of
production.
 The second phase could boost output by 20 billion cubic
meters from 2014, compared with a previous forecast of 16 bcm.

 * Development assistance the major stumbling block
 * EAC optimistic of striking deal
 
 By Richard Lough
 NAIROBI, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The five-nation East African
Community will likely miss a November deadline to sign a trade
deal with the European Union, the economic bloc's secretary
general said on Thursday.
 Juma Mwapachu told Reuters however he was confident an
accord will be reached on the Economic Partnership Agreement,
which was designed to replace preferential trade deals which the
World Trade Organisation has struck down.
 ""Well I am not sure we will be able to meet the November
deadline ... but we hope to be able to finalise everything,""
Mwapachu said in an interview.
 EAC members Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi --
with a combined gross domestic product of $73.3 billion -- have
been at loggerheads for months with the EU, after initialing the
EPA deal in 2007 and securing access to European markets.
 Talking on the sidelines of a regional infrastructure
investment conference, Mwapachu said trade and development
issues had been the principal stumbling blocks.
 ""The EAC partner states still feel that what should drive
the EPA is how to address (our) supply side constraints. That is
the only way you can boost trade between our countries and the
European Union, otherwise you don't have a win-win situation.""
 A deal was meant to be agreed in July 2009. By refusing to
sign the agreement, there are no legally binding commitments on
the existing EU market access.
 Mwapachu said the negotiations had been held up in part
because member states had lacked the finances to fund their
intra-bloc technical meetings, but those were expected to resume
in mid-November.
 The EU said in February it wanted a clear timetable for
signing the deal, but Tanzania's trade minister said at the time
the EAC would not shift from its stance until it had received
firm commitments on development assistance, in particular for
infrastructure. [ID:nLDE61E26I]
 Mwapachu said Africa faced an annual infrastructure
investment deficit of $60 billion, with $93 billion needed
annually over the next 10 years to haul the continent's
dilapidated transport and energy sectors into the 21st century.
 ""Here in the EAC, our railways are completely gone, our
roads are still poor. So there are various infrastructure issues
that would demand we get some support from the EU.""
 ""We need to sit around the table and tell them that unless
we address these infrastructure problems we'll just end up being
a market for the European Union rather than ending up with a
win-win situation,"" Mwapachu told Reuters.
 He gave no timeframe for concluding a deal but said he was
optimistic the EU was intent on brokering an agreement.
 ""The EU has really been pushing hard to restart these talks
so I believe in that there must be a spirit of give and take, so
I see them moving from this rather difficult stance to becoming
more accommodating to the development needs of the EAC states.""
 East Africa's largest economy, Kenya, stands to lose most if
the EU deal is not signed as it is excluded from the
classification of a Least Developed Country.
 It would miss out on exporting goods to Europe tariff-free
under the Everything But Arms initiative, which other EAC
members qualify for. Kenya would have to start paying duty of
between 8.5 per cent and 15.7 per cent.

 * Yields on rate futures firm after minutes
 By Elzio Barreto
 SAO PAULO, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank
signaled Thursday that it is unlikely to raise interest rates
in coming months, though concerns over food prices and an
overvalued currency continue to hover over an otherwise robust
economy.
 In minutes from last week's monetary policy meeting, at
which the bank left rates unchanged, policymakers said they saw
inflation falling closer to the central bank's target range of
4.5 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points.
 The outlook underscored the bank's belief that Brazil's
economy remains in a charmed pattern of high growth and
relatively low inflation, despite some pressure from rising
food prices and robust consumer demand.
 ""The assumption is that this (recent) hump in inflation
will be temporary, despite the heated economy,"" said Zeina
Latif, senior Latin America economist at RBS in Sao Paulo.
""There are risks, of course, but I see no problem in keeping
rates stable and waiting for more signs.""

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Instead, Central Bank President Henrique Meirelles focused
on what seems to be the biggest risk to Brazil's economy at the
moment -- the real, which like the currencies of many other
emerging markets is strengthening against a weak U.S. dollar.
 Meirelles urged that the world's largest economies agree on
coordinated efforts to prevent currency volatility at next
month's meeting of G20 leaders in South Korea. However, he
suggested Brazil could go its own way until a deal is reached.
 ""Obviously, while we don't get there, each country will
have to take measures to protect their own currency,"" Meirelles
told reporters in Sao Paulo. ""We are taking action to protect
the Brazilian economy.""
 NO RATE MOVE
 This year Brazil's economy, the largest in Latin America,
is set to grow more than 7 percent -- its fastest pace in more
than two decades, boosted by public works projects and a surge
in credit.
 The rapid expansion pressured consumer prices as more and
more Brazilians line up to buy new cars, homes and appliances,
prompting the central bank to raise borrowing costs by 2
percentage points between April and September before pausing.
 The benchmark Selic rate, at 10.75 percent, is among the
highest in the world and is attracting a flood of U.S. dollars
from overseas investors that has sparked a 5 percent rally in
the Brazilian real  since the end of June.
 Recent data point to an improved balance of risks for
government administered prices, the central bank's economic
policy committee, known as Copom, said in the minutes. Still,
the bank said is ready to change monetary policy quickly if
pressures on consumer prices increase.
 Analysts in a weekly central bank survey expect the Selic
to stay at 10.75 percent through the end of 2010, leaving it
for central bank officials in Brazil's next administration to
decide whether to hike rates to keep prices in check.
 All polls released recently forecast Brazilian ruling party
candidate Dilma Rousseff winning a runoff vote on Sunday by a
wide margin. One of her biggest challenges will be to control
government spending in a bid to slow the economy and ease
pressures on inflation.
 ""In the minutes, they're basically saying they will not
move, period. But unless there is a real fiscal consolidation,
I mean real consolidation, by the second quarter of 2011
reality will sink in,"" said Pedro Tuesta, senior Latin America
economist at research firm 4Cast Inc in Washington.
 Yields on Brazilian interest rate futures contracts
<0#DIJ:> were little changed after the central bank minutes.
The yield on the contract due January 2012  firmed to
11.37 percent from 11.36 percent on late Wednesday.
 Food prices that have surged in recent weeks are pressuring
inflation more than in the recent past, but the central bank
has taken those risks into consideration, the minutes said.
 ""Despite that, at this moment it remains our understanding
that the convergence of inflation to the center of the target
will likely happen,"" policymakers said in the minutes.

 By Lionel Laurent and Matthieu Protard
 PARIS, Oct 28 (Reuters) - BNP Paribas and Societe Generale
are seen posting higher quarterly profits next week even as
concerns linger over French banks' exposure to tighter capital
requirements and retail banking headwinds.
 France's lenders are under pressure to shed more light on
how new ""Basel III"" capital rules will affect their balance
sheets as fears persist they may need to raise capital.
 ""The French banks are lagging a bit disclosure-wise, and
Basel III is really very important,"" said WestLB analyst
Christoph Bossmann.
 Societe Generale, which reports results on Nov. 3, is seen
posting a near-doubling in third-quarter net profit to 793
million euros ($1.1 billion), according to a Reuters poll of 14
analysts. Revenue is seen up 5 percent at 6.27 billion.
 BNP, which reports results a day later, is seen reporting a
33.6 percent increase in net profit to 1.74 billion euros,
according to a Reuters poll of 12 analysts. Revenue is seen
slipping 1.5 percent to 10.51 billion, with investment banking
seen hurt by weakness in fixed income.
 Bank profitability is benefiting from a more benign risk
environment than a year ago, though analysts are expecting signs
of a pullback in French retail revenue because of an increase in
the government's benchmark savings rate.
 The interest rate on the ""Livret A"" government-backed
savings book, which rose to 1.75 percent in August from 1.25
percent, affects a variety of products and its increase means
banks pay out more to French savers.
 ""It is expected there will be a bit of a slowdown (in
retail),"" said Bossmann.
 French retail banking brought a greater share of revenue and
profit for SocGen last year than corporate and investment
banking, a key money-spinner for the bank.

 * Reliance's total orders with Shanghai Electric at $10 bln 

(Recasts, updates throughout) 
 By Fayen Wong 
 SHANGHAI, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Indian billionaire Anil
Ambani's Reliance Power inked an $8.3 billion deal with China's
Shanghai Electric Group, a contract which both firms touted as
the single largest business contract between the two nations.
 Shanghai Electric will supply 36 coal-fired thermal power
generation units to Reliance over three years, underscoring
India's hunger for electricity as the nation looks to fix the
frequent blackouts that have impeded economic growth.
 India, which has one of the world's lowest power consumption
per capita, has set an ambitious target of lifting its
generation capacity to 100,000 megawatts during 2012-17 and
plans to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure during the period.
 ""We see a potential for a gamut of co-operation between the
two countries,"" Anil Ambani, chairman of Reliance ADA Group,
told reporters at a signing ceremony in Shanghai on Thursday.
 ""India has vast needs for power and has one of the lowest
power consumption rate per capita with no reliable steady source
of power across the country,"" Ambani said.
 Including previous orders, Reliance said it has signed
around $10 billion worth of purchase orders with Shanghai
Electric, adding it also signed memorandums of understanding
with four major Chinese banks to cover the financing.
 Shanghai Electric said it was also looking to set up a
manufacturing facility in India as part of a strategy of
expanding in India's fast-growing power market.
 Zheng Jianhua, president of Shanghai Electric Power
Generation Group, said the group was also in discussions with
Reliance to supply equipment for other power sources, including
nuclear and wind.
 Shares in Reliance Power fell 2.4 percent by 1302 GMT, while
Shanghai Electric, which has a market value of $17 billion, rose
as much a 7.4 percent before closing up 0.2 percent.
 
 COMPETITION CONCERNS
 Supplies for power equipment and the telecom sector are two
fields which Chinese companies have made major breakthroughs in
the Indian market over the past few years, prompting some Indian
businesses to voice competition concerns.
 According to media reports, India's Association of Chamber
of Commerce last year urged the government to levy an import
duty on Chinese power equipment and accused the Chinese firms of
offering very low prices under government subsidies.
 Asked if the latest purchase from China would cause further
discontent among Indian power equipment makers, Ambani said the
rapid construction of power plants across the country meant most
Indian firms already have their order books full.
 ""The scale of construction we're wanting to achieve is only
possible with global outsourcing,"" said the 51-year-old Ambani,
who arrived in Shanghai via his private jet.
 Anil and his older brother Mukesh are among India's richest
businessmen. They split a business empire inherited from their
father Dhirubhai Ambani five years ago after disagreeing over
ownership.
 Shanghai Electric and Reliance Infrastructure already have a
close working relationship. The two set up a $3 billion joint
venture in 2008 to manufacture turbines and generators in India.
 Shanghai Electric said in an earlier statement the deal will
bring as much as $600 million in annual sales each year, or
about 6 to 7 percent of its total revenue for 2009.

 NEW YORK, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The dollar slipped on
Thursday, surrendering some gains from the last two days, as
U.S. Treasury yields fell, making them less attractive and
easing demand for the dollars to buy them.
 A recent move to trim extreme short dollar positions, amid
speculation the Federal Reserve will announce plans to buy more

 Traders said dollar selling against the euro and other

U.S. currency down.
 ""In this case we are getting a little bit of a driver from
lower yields,"" said Joseph Trevisani, chief market analyst at

 The 10-year Treasury note  was up 8/32 in price

 NARROWING SPREADS
 Other analysts said the dollar was also weighed down by a
narrowing in spreads between 10-year U.S. and euro zone
government bonds.
 But the euro held above a one-week low around $1.3734
 hit on electronic trading platform EBS on Wednesday,
even as debt concerns in Ireland and Greece and a breakdown in
budget talks in Portugal highlighted problems facing periphery
euro zone countries.
 Peter Frank, currency strategist at Societe Generale in
London, said support for the euro despite sovereign debt issues
illustrated the resilience of the single currency, and that he
expected it to rise back above $1.40 in the near term.
 But worries about the banking sector and the region's debt
problems could check the euro's gains. The European Central
Bank's quarterly Bank Lending Survey said more banks expect to
tighten their credit standards for corporate loans in Q4.
 The news could check hawkish ECB intentions to scale back
emergency stimulus measures, said Tom Levinson, a forex
strategist at ING. ""This serves as a warning on what is going
on in the real economy. It's less of a positive for euro but
the real dominant force is still the U.S. story.""
 U.S. STORY
 Wall Street analysts expect the Federal Reserve to buy $80
billion to $100 billion worth of assets per month under a new
programme widely expected to be unveiled on Nov. 3, according
to a Reuters poll. [FED/R]
 Estimates for how much the Fed will eventually spend varied
from $250 billion to $2 trillion. The market has been scaling
back expectations as the event draws nearer.
 ""The issue is whether the market believes the Fed will
deliver significant quantitative easing over a definitive time
line,"" said Frank at Societe Generale. ""If they do, the dollar
will weaken.""
 Lingering uncertainty about how the Fed will announce more
QE has increased market volatility, with one-week implied
volatility for euro/dollar  jumping to 15.3 percent on
Thursday from 12.6 percent at the start of the week.
 Against the yen, the dollar  fell 0.7 percent to
81.11 yen. The Japanese currency showed little reaction to a
Bank of Japan decision to keep interest rates virtually at zero
while holding off from new policy initiatives.
The dollar is holding above a 15-year low of 80.41 yen hit
earlier this week on EBS, but investors remain vigilant for any
yen-weakening intervention after authorities entered the market
last month.

 By Mayank Bhardwaj
 NEW DELHI, Oct 28 (Reuters) - India's sugar output is
expected to jump by nearly a half in the new 2010-2011 season
from October, with a bigger cane crop and improved yields after
late rains, the chief of Sucden India said on Thursday.
 ""Keeping the current situation in mind, I see an output of
28 million tonnes,"" Yatin Wadhwana, managing director of Sucden
India, told Reuters in an interview. The country produced 18.8
million tonnes in 2009/10.
 That level of output in the world's top sugar consumer and
the second-biggest producer would leave a larger surplus for
exports, when demand from countries such as Russia, Pakistan and
Indonesia perks up and while supplies from top producer Brazil
are set to shrink.
 ""With such robust production, we will have plenty of sugar
in hand to export. In any case, not less than 2-2.5 million
tonnes. And we also have to remember that carryover stocks from
the previous season are at 4.9 million tonnes,"" Wadhwana said.
 Opening stocks on Oct. 1, 2009 were at 3.2 million tonnes,
data from Indian Sugar Mills Association, a producers' body,
showed.

 MORE EXPORTS SEEN
 Wadhwana said output in Maharashtra state, the top sugar
producer, was expected at 10 million tonnes, while the
second-largest producer, Uttar Pradesh state, could churn out as
much as 8 million tonnes.
 India, which swung back to being an exporter after importing
large quantities in 2009 and early this year, has contracted to
export 570,000 tonnes of sugar so far.
 The government will consider allowing further exports only
after Diwali, Farm Minister Sharad Pawar said this week,
referring to next week's festival of lights when sugar demand
soars.
 Higher exports from India may help global sugar prices ease.
In February large imports by India helped push New York sugar
futures to a 29-year high of 30.4 cents per lb.
 On Wednesday, benchmark prices jumped 0.63 cent or 2.3
percent to close at 28.59 cents per lb.
 Wadhwana said domestic prices, which had fallen more than a
third in 2010, would remain steady now and then start sliding
again after Diwali on new-season sugar arrivals, while global
prices were likely to remain higher due to poor rains in Brazil
and rising demand from many countries.
 Consultancy Kingsman SA on Thursday revised down its 2010/11
global sugar surplus forecast to just over 2 million tonnes from
a previous estimate of 3.5 million tonnes.
 ""Country after country needs sugar, and I do not see
supplies coming from anywhere other than India. That makes me
believe international prices will remain tight, at least until
February and March,"" Wadhwana said.

 * Says not currently planning 30-yr linker
 * Aims to reduce proportion of money mkt instruments
 
 By Christina Amann and Sarah Marsh
 FRANKFURT, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Germany will have to issue
significantly more debt than before the financial crisis for
several more years, despite its strong recovery and tough
austerity measures, the head of its Finance Agency chief said.
 But levels of net new borrowing next year look set to be
comparatively modest.
 Carl Heinz Daube told Reuters in an interview that high
refinancing needs meant Europe's largest economy could reduce
total debt issuance only slowly, regardless of the level of net
new borrowing.
 ""It will take greater efforts to reach the pre-crisis level
of total debt issuance,"" he said.
 The finance agency would have to issue between 260 billion
and 280 billion euros of debt instruments annually until 2014
simply to service existing debt -- some 60 billion euros more
than before the crisis in 2008 which sent Germany reeling into
its deepest post-war recession.
 On top of that comes net new borrowing bringing the total to
more than 300 billion euros next year, said Daube.
 The agency cannot finalise its debt issuance plans for next
year until the government has published its 2011 budget plans,
which are due at the beginning of November.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet estimated net new
borrowing for next year at 57.5 billion euros in July. Given
Germany's faster-than-expected recovery, however, coalition
sources say it is now more likely net new borrowing will be
under 50 billion euros.
 Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said last weekend net
new borrowing would be around 50 billion euros this year, well
below the initial target of around 80 billion euros.
 Lower borrowing this year automatically reduces the level of
borrowing allowed in subsequent years because of a new ""debt
brake"" law which comes into force in 2011.
 The law requires Germany to cut the structural deficit step
by step by around 10 billion euros and reduce the deficit-to-GDP
ratio to a limit of 0.35 percent by 2016.
 Daube said the finance agency wanted federal debt issuance
to cover the entire maturity structure in 2011, as it did this
year. The Finance Agency will publish its 2011 debt issuance
calendar in December.
 
 MONEY MARKET OVERKILL
 In the long term, the agency wants to reduce the amount of
money market instruments it issues in favour of more capital
market instruments, said Daube. During the crisis it had been
obliged to issue more money market instruments in order to cover
costs potentially arising from bank bailouts.
 It was still unclear however whether the agency could
already next year re-establish the relation of two thirds
capital market and one third money market instruments that had
been in place before the financial crisis.
 The agency remains committed to issuing inflation-linked
bonds, Daube said, and aims in the long run to generate between
3 and 5 percent of its annual issuance volume through such
so-called linkers. However conditions were not yet favourable
for the agency to issue a 30-year linker.
 ""It depends on the market conditions,"" said Daube. ""We are
continuously examining these, at the moment I don't see any
opportunity for one.""
 Daube said the agency would only issue a foreign currency
bond if it yielded significant savings for the German taxpayer.
It was keeping an eye out for such an opportunity and would
decide quickly whether or not to issue such a bond. Germany last
issued a dollar bond in autumn 2009.

 * Bond holdings dip on concerns of over-valuation
 
 By Claire Milhench
 LONDON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - UK fund managers added to
equities in October and reduced their exposure to bonds and cash
in anticipation of a second round of quantitative easing from
central banks, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.
 The survey of 12 British fund managers found that the
average equities allocation in global balanced investment
portfolios jumped to 53.5 percent from 49.1 percent in
September, with UK, Asia ex-Japan and Latin America equities all
registering increases. 
 Cash slipped to 7.1 percent from 8.7 percent as managers
decided it made sense to increase their risk exposures ahead of
an expected second round of central bank stimulus. 
 ""We have been putting some cash back to work recently,
particularly into equities and precious metals,"" said Neil
Michael, executive director, investment strategies at London &
Capital. ""These assets will benefit from QE because investors
will be looking to re-invest the proceeds from the sale of
government bonds to the central banks.""
 He added that the fall in government bond yields, and the
rise in asset values resulting from the re-investment of excess
cash, will increase access to and reduce the cost of capital,
helping to support economic activity. ""This in turn will improve
company profits, giving a further tailwind to equities.""
 Within equities there was no change to the average sector
weightings, with consumer discretionary remaining the most
underweight and materials the most overweight positions.
 Bond holdings slipped to 22.2 percent from 24.7 percent,
with respondents expressing concern about current valuations and
the impact of further quantitative easing. 
 UK gilts remained the most underweight and corporates the
most overweight bond positions. 
 Alec Letchfield, chief investment officer, UK Wealth, at
HSBC Global Asset Management, which has an underweight
allocation to bonds, said he saw some near-term risk that
additional QE could lengthen the current period of strong bond
performance. 
 ""However, our position is based on a longer-term valuation
perspective and we are not minded to make changes at this
stage,"" he added.
 Allocations to property increased to 2.5 percent from 2
percent, whilst alternatives slipped back to 14.7 percent from
15.5 percent.
 Several respondents mentioned making an increased allocation
to gold, which is seen as a solid alternative to weak paper
currencies and an effective hedge against inflation. 
 ""In the current economic environment, we believe gold will
continue to perform well,"" said Dirk Wiedmann, head of
investments at Rothschild Private Banking and Trust. 
 ""By contrast, government bonds look extremely overvalued and
the outlook for equities is more mixed, following a strong run
in September.""

1131,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2010 08:20AM ET</span>",European funds lift equity holdings to 8-month high-poll," By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - European fund managers lifted
their equity holdings to an eight-month high in October and cut
bonds and cash as strong corporate earnings and the resilience
of the global economy push world stocks to two-year peaks.
 The poll of 17 Europe-based asset management firms outside
of Britain released on Thursday showed a typical mixed portfolio
holding 48.4 percent in equities this month, the highest since
February.
 It held 39.0 percent in bonds -- including government and
corporate debt -- which is the lowest level since June.
 Cash holdings fell to a nine-month low of 6.0 percent from
6.6 percent in September, reflecting a growing appetite among
investors to put cash to work.
 The poll was taken between Oct. 19 and 27, when world stocks
hit their highest level in two years thanks to corporate
earnings and anticipation that central banks would inject more
liquidity to support the economy.
 Investors allocated 32.3 percent of their equity investments
into the United States and Canada, up from 31.3 percent last
month. Euro zone equity holdings fell to 36.4 percent from 38.9
percent.
 Within equities, investors were underweight utilities --
often considered as a defensive sector -- and financials, while
they liked energy stocks.
 In fixed income, respondents allocated 67.2 percent to the
euro zone, down from 68.2 percent last month.
 Overall, they held 53.2 percent in government securities,
down from 58.4 percent in September, while they had 29.4 percent
in investment grade corporate paper and 8.2 percent in
high-yield bonds. 
 Respondents were most underweight in U.S. Treasuries, while
they overweighted corporate bonds -- maintaining the trend seen
in the past several months. 
 Overall, investors were most overweight on equities, while
they were most underweight in bonds.

1132,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2010 08:16AM ET</span>",WRAPUP 1-Funds dump U.S./eurozone stocks for emerging mkts-poll," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Solid growth in emerging markets
and a struggling U.S. economy prompted global investors to pump
money into Asian and Latin American stocks in October, Reuters
polls showed on Thursday.
 Four surveys of 56 leading investment houses in the United
States, Europe ex-UK, Britain and Japan showed equity holdings
at their highest level in six months and bonds at their lowest
since May.
 But the overall figures masked a shift away from U.S. and
euro zone equities towards emerging markets and Britain, whose
major companies have large global exposure.
 Overall, the 56 firms raised equity holdings to 52.7 percent
of a typical portfolio of mixed assets from 50.8 percent in
September.
 Bonds dropped to 34.6 percent from 36.1 percent and cash
fell to 5.0 percent from 5.4 percent, still a high enough level
to provide more fuel for a risk rally..
 Within equity portfolios, however, it is clear that the
primary driver for the October stock market rally has been a
shift into emerging markets.
 Exposure to equities in emerging Europe, Asia ex-Japan.
Latin America and Africa/Middle East rose to 15.6 percent of a
typical stock portfolio from 14.3 percent a month earlier.
 By contrast, investors cut U.S. equity holdings to 42.4
percent from 43.2 percent, and euro zone stocks to 20.8 from
21.6 percent.
 Respondents said one of the main catalysts for the move to
equities was the prospect for more asset-buying, or quantitative
easing, from central banks, mainly the U.S. Federal Reserve.
This would pump liquidity into the system, weaken the dollar,
make emerging market currencies more attractive and lift
commodity prices.
 ""We have been putting some cash back to work recently,
particularly into equities and precious metals,"" said Neil
Michael, executive director, investment strategies at London &
Capital.
 ""These assets will benefit from QE because investors will be
looking to re-invest the proceeds from the sale of government
bonds to the central banks.""
 
 REGIONALLY
 U.S. fund managers raised their exposure to equities in
October and cut their high allocation to fixed-income assets.
 The 14 U.S.-based fund management firms polled raised equity
holdings for a second consecutive month to an average 62.4
percent of their assets, compared with 61.7 percent in September
and 61.5 percent in August.
 Fixed-income securities, including government,
investment-grade and high-yield ""junk"" bonds, dropped for a
second consecutive month to 30.4 percent in October from 31.1
percent in September.
 European fund managers outside Britain lifted their equity
holdings to an eight-month high while cutting bonds and cash.
 The poll of 17 Europe-based asset management firms showed a
typical mixed portfolio holding 48.4 percent in equities in
October, its highest since February, compared with 46.6 percent
last month.
 They held 39.0 percent in bonds, the lowest level since
June. Cash holdings fell to a nine-month low of 6.0 percent
from 6.6 percent in September.
 Japanese fund managers raised their weighting for equities
to the highest level in 10 months while cutting their exposure
to bonds.
 The 13 managers polls lifted their average weighting for
equities to 46.6 percent, the highest since December, from 45.7
percent the previous month.
 The weighting for bonds fell to 46.8 percent in October from
48.5 percent a month earlier. Cash positions increased to 3.7
percent after falling to a low for this year of 2.9 percent in
September.
 UK fund managers rounded off the broad move to equities and
reduced their exposure to bonds and cash.
 The survey of 12 British fund managers found that the
average equities allocation jumped to 53.5 percent from 49.1
percent in September. Bond holdings slipped to 22.2 percent from
24.7 percent.
 Cash dropped to 7.1 percent from 8.7 percent.

1133,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2010 08:08AM ET</span>",Europe eyes deep disposal for nuclear waste problem," * Current EU nuclear waste plans ""not satisfactory"" - draft
 * Legally binding EU rules needed to safeguard citizens
 * Deep depositories offer best available option - draft
 * Nuclear industry must pay for disposal, not taxpayers
 
 By Pete Harrison
 BRUSSELS, Oct 28 (Reuters) - A leaked European Commission
draft report says Europe should solve the problem of handling
nuclear waste by making industry pay to stash it deep
underground, where it will be overseen by independent watchdogs.
 ""The current situation of spent fuel and radioactive waste
management in EU member states is not satisfactory,"" says the
draft, seen by Reuters on Thursday.
 EU Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger will propose new,
legally binding rules on Nov. 3 designed to pave a safer path
for the renaissance of nuclear power generation in countries
such as Britain and his homeland, Germany.
 The best option for disposing of spent nuclear fuel is in
""deep geological repositories"" -- caverns in clay or granite
rocks between 100 metres and 700 metres underground -- says the
draft, which feeds into the EU's future nuclear waste directive.
 The region produces about 50,000 cubic metres (1.77 million
cu ft) of radioactive waste EU each year, of which about 500
cubic metres (17,700 cu ft) are highly active, says industry
group Foratom.
 Anti-nuclear campaigners welcomed planned measures to ensure
greater public scrutiny, independence of waste watchdogs and
payment of costs by nuclear operators, not by future taxpayers.
 But they accused Oettinger's advisers of glossing over
serious doubts about the safety of deep disposal.
 ""There are gaps in the science, and no disposal site
currently exists, yet the Commission is claiming this is a
proven method,"" said Greenpeace campaigner Jan Haverkamp. ""We
fear a disposal facility could rupture high-level nuclear waste
into the water table for hundreds of thousands of years.""
 Foratom countered that 30 years of research into developing
deep sites had proven the method to be feasible.
 ""As a natural barrier, the rock formation will ensure safety
even better than human beings could do,"" said Foratom's
Christian Taillebois. ""Why should we wait any longer before
implementing what is described by scientists as the safest
option for waste management?""
 
 PUBLIC MISTRUST
 Current international rules for nuclear waste carry little
legal clout, and most such waste is currently kept in interim
storage sites, waiting for a permanent solution.
 Public mistrust runs high, with the Chernobyl nuclear
accident in 1986 still fresh in many Europeans' minds and with
widespread concerns about terrorist sabotage.
 Nowhere is the issue more tense than in Oettinger's
homeland, where demonstrators took to the streets of Berlin in
September after the government extended the lifespan of
Germany's 17 nuclear power stations.
 ""Without EU action there is an increasing risk of a negative
environmental impact over time,"" says the draft. ""Geological
disposal is the only end-point option that is being actively
pursued.""
 Sweden, France and Finland are on track to have deep
disposal sites operating by 2025, with Germany, Britain and
Belgium making rapid progress, says the draft, but some of the
other 14 EU countries with nuclear plants are taking a risky
wait-and-see approach.
 ""This will place undue burdens and threats on future
generations,"" it adds.
 Companies will have to stash away billions of euros to pay
for disposal of spent nuclear fuel, ensuring that future
taxpayers are not left with the bill and to keep competition
fair versus other power generators, who already have to pay for
their pollution.
 It cited Germany as an example. Taxpayers may have to pick
up a bill of around 3.5 billion euros ($4.8 billion) for dealing
with waste dating back to the sixties, stashed underground in
the Asse salt mine.
 ""These funds should be properly managed and protected in
order to make sure that they are available when costs arise,""
says the draft.
 Disposal costs could range between 0.14-0.16 euro cents per
kilowatt hour or 3.5-4 percent of the assumed total generating
costs of 4 euro cents per kilowatt hour, it says, citing Finnish
and Swedish estimates.

 * Investors get ready for next week's Fed meeting
 * 1-week implied vols for euro/dollar rise

(Adds comment, details, updates prices)
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The dollar slipped on Thursday,
relinquishing some of its gains from earlier this week as a
short-covering rally ran out of steam and U.S. Treasury yields
fell after a spike the previous day.
 Traders said dollar selling against the euro and other
currencies by reserve managers was also helping to push the U.S.
currency down.
 Investors trimmed extreme short dollar positions earlier
this week as speculation that the Federal Reserve might announce
plans to buy more assets to stimulate the economy next week
turned into a guessing game about how much they would purchase.
 The New York Federal Reserve has surveyed bond dealers and
investors over the size and impact of a quantitative easing
programme, with scenarios ranging from zero up to $1 trillion,
Bloomberg news reported on Thursday, citing a copy of the
survey.
 ""We'd seen a short squeeze in the dollar in the past few
days due to an exhaustion in positioning, but when there's no
incentive to maintain that, you get some profit taking,"" said
Peter Frank, currency strategist at Societe Generale.
 ""The issue is whether the market believes the Fed will
deliver significant quantitative easing over a definitive time
line. If they do, the dollar will weaken.""
 A Reuters poll showed Wall Street analysts expect the
Federal Reserve to buy $80 billion to $100 billion worth of
assets per month under a new programme widely expected to be
unveiled on Nov. 3.
 ""We're seeing some consolidation in the dollar before the
Fed meeting as no-one knows how much QE the Fed might do,"" said
Marcus Hettinger, global currency strategist at Credit Suisse in
Zurich.
 Other analysts said the dollar was also weighed down by a
narrowing in spreads between 10-year U.S. and euro zone
government bonds driven by a fall in U.S. Treasury yields.
 By 1130 GMT, the euro had risen 0.6 percent on the day to
$1.3849, helped by steady buying by Asian central banks. This
helped to push the dollar 0.62 percent lower versus a currency
basket.
 
 EURO RIDES PERIPHERY CONCERNS
 The euro held above a one-week low around $1.3730 hit on
Wednesday, even as debt concerns in Ireland and Greece and a
breakdown in budget talks in Portugal highlighted problems
facing periphery euro zone countries.
 Frank at SG said that support for the euro despite sovereign
debt issues illustrated the resilience of the single currency,
and that he expected it to rise back above $1.40 in the near
term.
 But worries about the banking sector and the region's debt
problems could check the euro's gains. The European Central
Bank's quarterly Bank Lending Survey said more banks expect to
tighten their credit standards for corporate loans in Q4.
 The news could check hawkish ECB intentions to scale back
emergency stimulus measures, said Tom Levinson, a forex
strategist at ING. ""This serves as a warning on what is going on
in the real economy. It's less of a positive for euro but the
real dominant force is still the U.S. story.""
 Lingering uncertainty about how the Fed will announce more
QE has increased market volatility, with one-week implied
volatility for euro/dollar jumping to 15.9 percent on Thursday
from 12.6 percent at the start of the week.
 Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.6 percent to 81.26. The
Japanese currency showed little reaction to a Bank of Japan
decision to keep interest rates virtually at zero while holding
off from new policy initiatives.
 The dollar is holding above a 15-year low of 80.41 yen hit
earlier this week, but investors remain vigilant for any
yen-weakening intervention after authorities entered the market
last month.

 * Stops some activities in Iran over U.S. sanctions
 
 By Alex Lawler
 LONDON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc said it
would assess any impact of European sanctions on its oil trade
with Iran and had stopped some activities there following
tougher U.S. measures earlier this year.
 The European Union sanctions over Iran's nuclear work,
launched in July and which became law this week, seek to block
oil and gas investment in the Islamic Republic, the world's
fifth largest oil exporter.
 ""Our trading business with Iran is carried out under
longer-term contracts,"" Shell's chief financial officer, Simon
Henry, said on Thursday. ""We continue to lift (buy Iranian
crude) under those contracts, but we do need to assess any
implications of the European legislation.""
 ""It's fair to say that the European legislation, some of
which was only clarified this week, we still need to understand.
There are clearly some implications around payment
transactions.""
 Oil industry sources have said that following the measures
financial transactions with Iran have become more difficult,
making it harder to pay for Iranian exports in currencies such
as the euro and the dollar.
 As a result, the sources say that some European oil
companies have scaled back their purchases of Iranian oil this
year and are reviewing whether to buy Iranian oil in 2011.
 Henry said Shell always worked within sanctions and legal
requirements and was stopping some business in Iran due to U.S.
sanctions passed earlier this year. The U.S. measures did not
apply to crude oil trading.
 ""The amount of activities is relatively low in materiality
terms. We don't have big investments there,"" he said.
 ""We are withdrawing from some small downstream activities
and we have been providing technical advice to some of the
upstream. But that will all now stop.""
 ""We stopped supplying refined products last year and we're
not supplying aviation fuel outside Iran.""
 Henry was speaking on a conference call after the company
reported its third-quarter earnings.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Strong corporate earnings lifted
global stocks on Thursday while the dollar fell, paring recent
gains, as uncertainty over how much monetary easing the Federal
Reserve will opt for next week kept investors cautious.
 Forecast-beating earnings, including from Royal Dutch Shell,
and gains in mining and technology stocks helped lift European
shares 0.6 percent after doubts over the U.S. stimulus had
pushed them to a two-week closing low on Wednesday.
 Global stocks were higher, with the MSCI world equity index
up 0.4 percent after falling on Wednesday. U.S. stock futures
also pointed to a higher opening on Wall Street.
 Investors awaited the latest weekly reading of U.S.
unemployment at 1230 GMT for clues about the health of the
world's largest economy before Wednesday's Fed decision.
 ""Sentiment seesaws between the positive corporate outlook in
the short term ... and the dark macro environment with the
potential for further storms ahead. Volatility continues to be
the name of the game,"" said Henk Potts, equity strategist at
Barclays Wealth.
 Market participants have scaled back expectations for the
extent of Fed QE likely next week in recent days, pushing the
dollar and U.S. Treasury yields higher.
 There is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the Fed
decision, however. The latest Reuters poll showed economists'
estimates for how much money the Fed will print varied widely,
from $250 billion to as high as $2 trillion.
 
 DOLLAR PARES RECENT GAINS
 The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against
a basket of major currencies, was down 0.7 percent at 77.630,
with a short covering rally pausing as uncertainty over Fed
easing left investors wary. The euro rose 0.6 percent, while the
dollar fell nearly 0.5 percent versus the yen.
 ""Interest rate differentials had stopped moving against the
dollar, but today the dollar is giving up a bit of those gains,""
said Marcus Hettinger, global currency strategist at Credit
Suisse in Zurich. 
 ""We're seeing some consolidation in the dollar before the
Fed meeting as no one knows how much QE the Fed might do.""
 German bund futures started the day higher but pulled back
to trade up 4 ticks at 128.85 after solid demand at an auction
of Italian debt. Concerns about the health of some peripheral
euro zone economies, however, widened the spreads between the
bond yields of those countries and those of Germany.
 Government talks with the opposition in Portugal over the
budget broke down on Wednesday, while there were signs Ireland
was preparing to cut public spending even further.
 U.S. 10-year Treasury yields slipped from late U.S. trade,
after reaching their highest since Sept. 20 on Wednesday.
 Gold prices rose slightly to $1,329.00 an ounce, against
$1,324.70 late in New York, helped by a weaker dollar.
 U.S. crude oil gained 20 cents to $82.14 a barrel after
falling nearly 1 percent on Wednesday.
 Emerging stocks were up 0.3 percent.

 * Says FSB to list SIFIS next year

(adds Draghi comments, background)
 By Gavin Jones and James Mackenzie
 ROME, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Widening balance of payments
imbalances and currency interventions aimed at boosting exports
mean the global economic recovery is at risk, European Central
Bank Governing Council Member Mario Draghi warned on Thursday.
In a keynote speech to celebrate savings day in Rome, Draghi
said the only way to address the problem was through closer
co-operation between the world's large economies, something that
the G20 was aware of. 
 ""The recovery is strong in emerging economies, weak in the
United States, unequal in the euro zone,"" the Bank of Italy
governor told a gathering of politicians and bankers. 
 ""Current account imbalances are widening again, free
floating currencies are suffering from (government currency
interventions), divergent policies and consequent speculative
tensions. The global recovery itself is at risk,"" he said. 
 Commitments made by the Group of 20 rich and emerging
economies to reduce imbalances were still an important step in
still ""difficult"" negotiations and showed there was common
awareness of ""the inevitability of common action,"" Draghi said.
 Draghi, who is president of the Financial Stability Board,
said the FSB would next year issue a list of so-called
Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs) whose size
or position means they could threaten the financial system if
they collapsed.
 The FSB will present the G20 with proposals aimed at
increasing the ability of these banks to withstand large losses
and at creating a regulatory framework that will allow
governments to let them fail when necessary, he said.
 Draghi, who is considered a candidate to head the ECB when
President Jean-Claude Trichet's term expires next year, called
for common European Union rules to oblige slow growing economies
to adopt necessary structural reforms to boost growth. 
 Closer to home, he said Italian economic growth will be ""not
far from 1 percent"" this year and also in 2011, compared with
the government's official forecasts of 1.2 percent in 2010 and
1.3 percent in 2011.
 A relatively firm recovery in the first half of the year had
been boosted by an increase in exports, which is now slowing
down, he said.
 Italy's jobless rate, officially 8.5 percent, would be above
11 percent if it included workers sent home on reduced pay and
people who had given up the search for work, Draghi said.
 In remarks likely to fuel a long-running spat with the
government over the state of Italy's labour market, Draghi said
that this would put Italy's jobless rate in line with France's
and above that of Britain and and Germany.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The dollar slipped on Thursday,
relinquishing some of the gains made earlier this week as a
short-covering rally ran out of steam and U.S. Treasury yields
fell.
 Traders said dollar selling against the euro and other
currencies by reserve managers was also helping to push the U.S.
currency down.
 Investors trimmed extreme short dollar positions earlier
this week as speculation the Federal Reserve might announce
plans to buy more assets to stimulate the economy next week
turned into a guessing game about how much they would purchase.
 The New York Federal Reserve has surveyed bond dealers and
investors over the size and impact of a quantitative easing
programme, including scenarios ranging from zero up to $1
trillion, Bloomberg news reported on Thursday, citing a copy of
the survey.
 The dollar rally has lost steam in the absence of
market-moving news, and analysts said the currency would stay
under selling pressure if the Fed says it will continue to pump
money into the market to improve liquidity and help the economy.
 ""We'd seen a short squeeze in the dollar in the past few
days due to an exhaustion in positioning, but when there's no
incentive to maintain that, you get some profit taking,"" said
Peter Frank, currency strategist at Societe Generale.
 ""The issue is whether the market believes the Fed will
deliver significant quantitative easing over a definitive time
line. If they do, the dollar will weaken.""
 A Reuters poll showed Wall Street analysts expect the
Federal Reserve to buy between $80 billion and $100 billion
worth of assets per month under a new programme widely expected
to be unveiled on Nov. 3.
 Other analysts said the dollar was also weighed down by a
narrowing in spreads between 10-year U.S. and euro zone
government bond, which was driven by a fall in U.S. Treasury
yields that put the brakes on a widening seen in the past week.
 By 1025 GMT, the euro had risen 0.5 percent on the day to
$1.3835, having climbed to a session high around $1.3850 in
early European trade. This helped to push the dollar 0.5 percent
lower versus a currency basket.
 ""We're seeing some consolidation in the dollar before the
Fed meeting as no one knows how much QE the Fed might do,"" said
Marcus Hettinger, global currency strategist at Credit Suisse in
Zurich.
 
 EURO RIDES PERIPHERY CONCERNS
 The euro held above a one-week low around $1.3730 hit on
Wednesday, even as ongoing debt concerns in Ireland and Greece,
and a breakdown in budget talks in Portugal highlighted problems
facing periphery euro zone countries.
 Frank at SG said that support for the euro despite sovereign
debt issues illustrated the resilience of the single currency,
and that he expected it to rise back above $1.40 in the near
term.
 Lingering uncertainty about how the Fed will announce more
QE has increased market volatility, with one-week implied
volatility for euro/dollar jumping to 15.9 percent on Thursday
from 12.6 percent at the start of the week.
 Against the yen, the dollar fell half a percent to the day's
trough of 81.23. The Japanese currency showed little reaction to
a Bank of Japan decision to keep interest rates virtually at
zero while holding off from new policy initiatives.
 The dollar is holding above a 15-year low of 80.41 yen hit
earlier this week, but investors remain vigilant for any
yen-weakening intervention after authorities entered the market
last month.
 The New Zealand dollar rose 0.5 percent, brushing off a
Reserve Bank of New Zealand decision to hold rates steady at 3
percent as investors took comfort from the central bank's
remarks that rates would still head higher at some point.

1140,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2010 06:48AM ET</span>",Q+A-How daunting is the Iraq energy challenge?," By Jon Hemming and Barbara Lewis
 LONDON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Iraq signed deals with
international oil companies following auctions last year that
could in theory take its oil capacity to 12 million barrels per
day (bpd) in seven years' time.
 But security problems, inadequate infrastructure and
political deadlock, which has left the country without a new
government nearly eight months after an election, have made most
analysts sceptical that target can be achieved.
 Gas auctions this month attracted little interest from
international oil companies. Deals were nevertheless awarded --
although not signed yet -- to develop three gas fields with
combined reserves of 11.23 trillion cubic feet of gas.
 The following addresses some of the questions overshadowing
Iraq's hydrocarbon production.
 
 HOW MUCH PROGRESS?
 More than seven years after the U.S.-led invasion,
production levels are still below the peak of around 3 million
bpd hit before the 1991 Gulf war.
 Following last year's oil auctions, the winning companies
have issued tenders and agreed contracts for new wells, renewing
old ones, de-gasification plants, de-mining oilfields and
building new export terminals.
 The companies have pressed ahead even in the absence of a
formal legal framework, laying the foundations for increased
production, although output figures have yet to respond.
 Most analysts see only a gradual increase in Iraq's oil
production over the next four years, and predicted in a Reuters
poll it would reach around 4.5 million bpd by the end of 2015.
That would still leave the country far off the 12 million bpd
capacity goal.
 
 WHEN WILL IRAQ GET A GOVERNMENT AND A HYDROCARBONS LAW?
 Following an inconclusive March 7 election, Iraq's political
leaders have failed to form a coalition and the new parliament
has not met since June. Talks could speed up after Iraq's
highest court on Sunday ordered the assembly to resume sessions
immediately.
 There is no guarantee Oil Minister Hussain al-Shahristani
will remain in office once a new government is in place, adding
a further element of uncertainty to the oil and gas sector.
 Even before the impasse following the election, rows between
majority Arabs and minority Kurds over revenue-sharing and
control of some fields held up laws to establish a modern legal
framework for Iraq's oil and gas sector.
 Work began on the legislation after the Iraqi constitution
was passed in 2005. The draft which garnered the most consensus
in parliament appeared in 2007, but the Kurds objected and the
proposed legislation has been stymied ever since.
 There are actually four draft laws: one providing a general
framework for the energy sector, a revenue-sharing law, a law
related to a new national oil company and a final law
reorganising the Oil Ministry.
 
 WHAT'S THE LOGIC OF THIS YEAR'S GAS AUCTIONS?
 The prime purpose of this year's gas auctions is to get gas
for power generation to help tackle Iraq's electricity blackouts
and meet pent-up demand.
 But given challenging economics for gas extraction at a time
of global oversupply, some question the logic of auctioning off
acreage.
 There is plenty of gas associated with Iraqi oil to be
captured and Royal Dutch Shell and Japan's Mitsubishi had
already agreed to a deal to capture gas being flared at southern
oilfields.
 Analysts ask whether the domestic market will provide enough
demand to absorb additional supplies and for now there is a lack
of infrastructure, meaning the potentially high-demand wider
Middle Eastern market and other customers are off-limits for
now.
 OPEC output targets could at some point constrain associated
gas output, but the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries is not expected to impose curbs on Iraqi crude
production for several years.
 
 IS THERE ANY RISK OF CONTRACTS BEING REPEALED?
 Although the lack of a formal legal framework is a worry,
many analysts still say a future government would be unlikely to
repeal the contracts awarded this year and last year because the
terms were so favourable for Iraq.
 The oil contracts were service contracts and remuneration
fees were in most cases only $2 per barrel or less.
 For gas exploration -- which, more than more profitable oil,
requires a stable environment and high incentives --
remuneration fees ranged between $5.50 and $7.50 per barrel of
oil equivalent.
 Another disincentive for renegotiation would be reluctance
to halt progress.
 Iraq has realised, however, it might not have enough money
for the enormous expansion of oil infrastructure needed and has
asked international oil firms whether they would be interested
in becoming involved.
 
 WHAT ABOUT THE CONTRACTS SIGNED WITH KURDISTAN?
 The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), which runs northern
Iraq, has signed around 40 production and exploration deals with
international oil companies.
 Baghdad has declared the deals unconstitutional and refuses
to pay firms involved, such as Norway's DNO and Turkey's Genel
Enerji. That has halted exports from Kurdish oilfields since
last year.
 ""All the signed contracts should be sent to the central
government and oil ministry to study and make sure they agree
with Iraqi laws, otherwise we still consider them illegal and
void,"" Shahristani told a news conference last week.
 The dispute stems from different interpretations by Baghdad
and the Kurds of current laws on the ownership of oil and gas
resources.
 The oil ministry says only the central government has the
right to develop national energy resources under laws that date
back to the nationalisation of the oil industry, while the Kurds
say their own regional hydrocarbon law passed in 2007 gives them
the right to sign oilfield deals with companies.
 The Kurds say the deals they have signed could lead to the
rapid development of fields in a largely peaceful region the KRG
says has 45 billion barrels of oil reserves.
 The Kurds also claim the oil-rich region of Kirkuk and other
areas, but a national census that would determine the ethnic mix
of the region has been postponed because of tension until Dec.
5.
 If it shows the Kurds are in a majority around Kirkuk, it
would strengthen their case for bringing it under their rule.

 NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - U.S. President
Barack Obama faces a range of trade hurdles when he travels to
India in early November to unlock a huge untapped commercial
potential that would help ballast the rise of Asian giant
China.
 Despite India's growing global weight, it is only the
United States' 14th biggest trading partner and obstacles, from
outsourcing controversies to the Doha world trade round, have
put the brakes on faster integration.
 The stakes on trade are high as the United States and India
need each other to meet ambitious export targets amid a
sluggish U.S. economic recovery, yawning trade deficits with
China and fears of global imbalances sparking a standoff.
 On the issue of global economic imbalances that have raised
fears of currency wars, India and the United States often
differ.
 Obama may ask Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for help
in Washington's push to prevent countries unilaterally
devaluing currency to make exports more competitive in the
run-up to the G20 heads of state meeting in Seoul next month.
 But at the G20 finance ministers' meet in South Korea,
India and China shot a U.S. proposal to cap current accounts of
countries with quantitative targets linked to their GDP.
 While ties bloomed during the Bush administration, the two
countries have entered what a former Indian envoy to Washington
told Reuters was a ""sobering phase"".
 ""It's only natural that people have high expectations,""
Naresh Chandra said, adding ""now we are coming from the general
to the specific. The problem lies in the detail.""
 ""When you start concluding agreements then each side wants
to have the best of both worlds and that is where the friction
starts. So what we are going through is what I would call a
sobering phase of managing the details.""
 A bilateral trade boom has seen total flows treble to $36.5
billion in goods in the decade to 2009-10, but the United
States. slipped from number one to three in India's trade
partners. India lags China, which is the United States' third
biggest trading partner.
 The Obama administration wants to double its exports within
five years to bolster domestic growth and create jobs.
Bilateral trade in goods and services between India and the
United States stands at $50 billion, a tenth of America's trade
with China, according to Ron Somers, President of the U.S.
India Business Council.
 Indo-U.S. business has basked in the warmth of closer ties
underscored by a landmark civilian nuclear deal signed in 2008.
 But both must work to overcome irritants including fears of
growing U.S. protectionism after the financial crisis, demands
on both sides for greater market access and differences over
Doha.
 TRADE DEFICITS
 The United States can push for deals including billion
dollar defence contracts. The powerful lobby group the
Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI)
has pushed for a relaxation in U.S. export controls to speed up
high-tech and defence industry trade. [ID:nN26143939]
 Such controls prevent, for example, Indian pharmaceutical
companies buying U.S. biotechnology to make vaccines on the
grounds it could be use to make anthrax weapons, FICCI's
Secretary General Amit Mitra told Reuters.
 In the absence of a Doha trade deal, India spread its wings
to negotiating trade deals with the likes of the European Union
and, in a mark of economic power moving from west to east, the
ASEAN bloc of Southeast Asian nations, Japan and Malaysia.
 ""India, at least the businesses here, have been looking at
their own neighbourhood much more,"" said trade commentator
Biswajit Dhar.
 Indian officials and industry groups have protested what
Trade Minister Anand Sharma called a ""highly discriminatory""
hike in visa fees by Washington, seen as aimed at India's IT
industry, as well as perceived non-tariff barriers against
Indian goods.
 In Washington on Wednesday, reporters peppered White House
Deputy National Security Advisor Michael Froman with questions
on whether Obama would raise outsourcing.
 ""I would simply say that a key part of the message is going
to be that we want to make sure there's opportunities for U.S.
jobs, U.S. exports,"" he said.
 Both sides have accused each other of policy foot-dragging,
especially over the Doha trade talks. In India there is a sense
that New Delhi is much keener to push for a deal than
Washington.
 The United States complains that India has not accepted the
responsibility that comes with its growing economic strength in
the world and insists on shielding many sectors.
 But while temperatures have risen over protectionism, India
may take this in its stride given compulsions in Washington
ahead of elections, where Obama's Democrats can expect a
pasting.
 Both sides talk up the fact that their trade is relatively
balanced, unlike with China.
 ""We understand the need for politicians to react in certain
ways under certain democratic circumstances. But we are hoping
that this is only a passing phase,"" FICCI's Mitra told
Reuters.

 * Prices spike, mining firms speeding development
 * Clinton says would welcome China policy clarification
(Adds Japanese firm to stop using rare earths)
 By Aileen Wang and Lucy Hornby
 BEIJING, Oct 28 (Reuters) - China said on Thursday it will
not use its dominance of supplies of rare earths as a
bargaining tool with foreign economies, and the United States
said it hoped trade in the high-tech ores would continue as
normal.
 China has slashed export quotas and reduced shipments to
Japan, igniting international concern that it could use rare
earth exports as an economic or political lever. Prices have
spiked and mining firms are rushing to develop sources of the
minerals outside China.
 The U.S. and European Union this week said they were
pressing for solutions to fears that China was choking supply
of the substances used in lasers, computers and
superconducters, among other applications, and the issue is
expected to figure at next month's G-20 summit.
 Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology
spokesman Zhu Hongren said Beijing sought international
cooperation.
 ""China will not use rare earths as an instrument for
bargaining,"" he told a news conference on Thursday. ""Instead,
we hope to cooperate with other countries in the use of rare
earths on the basis of win-win outcomes and jointly protecting
this unrenewable resource.""
 The ministry is one of several in China that oversee rare
earths.
 OTHER SUPPLIERS SOUGHT
 Zhu was speaking on the same day a newspaper published by
China's Ministry of Commerce urged China to resist pressure to
allow foreign firms more access to its rare earths.
 U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was
unaware of China's vow not to use them as a bargaining chip,
and, speaking in Hawaii, said she would welcome any
clarification of China's stance on the minerals.
 ""I ... hope that it means trade and commerce around these
important materials will continue unabated and without any
interference,"" Clinton told a news conference with Japan's
foreign minister.
 ""At the same time, because of the importance of these rare
earth minerals, I think both the minister and I are aware that
our countries and others will have to look for additional
sources of supply,"" she said.
 One engineering firm, Japan's Nidec, has already said it
will start making motors that do not use rare earths to lessen
reliance on the minerals.
 China supplies about 97 percent of the world's demand for
rare earth metals, which possess magnetic, luminescent and
other properties used in emerging clean energy technologies,
computers and electronics.
 Prices of some rare earths on world markets have increased
tenfold this year, reversing a long-trend towards lower prices
caused largely by greater Chinese production over the past two
decades.
 In response to higher prices and worries among major
consumers such as Japanese hi-tech industries that they will be
unable to rely on large scale deliveries from China, mining
firms are scrambling to speed up mine development timetables.
 Shares in potential producers of the minerals outside
China, such as Molycorp and Lynas Corp have rocketed since
July, when China said it was reducing exports by 72 percent in
the second half of the year.
 Australian firm Arafura Resources on Thursday raised A$90
million ($87.5 million) to develop a rare earths project, but
some analysts have said the long-term investment case for the
minerals may be weak, and the market has the makings of a
bubble. ID:nSGE69Q0R4]

 BERLIN, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The Chinese yuan's recent
appreciation is a welcome step along the path to addressing
global economic imbalances, which the euro zone had not
contributed to, European Central Bank rate-setter Axel Weber
said on Thursday.
 Weber also said that, within the euro zone, the bulk of
structural adjustments should be undertaken by countries with
current account deficits, ""as it was there that domestic
developments became unsustainable in the years prior to the
crisis.""
 ""It is of great importance for the euro area economy that
the adjustment process in the deficit countries continues,""
Weber added, according to the text of a speech given on
Thursday.
 ""Against this background, compensatory measures taken by
euro area countries with current account surpluses, like wage
increases or a more expansionary fiscal policy stance, would be
neither necessary nor helpful.""
 Weber noted that China continued to accumulate foreign
exchange reserves, mainly dollars.
 ""While this strategy appears to be rational from the surplus
country's point of view, it is partly responsible for making the
global economy more vulnerable to adverse shocks,"" he said.
 Weber, who also heads Germany's Bundesbank, added: ""The
recent appreciation of the Chinese renminbi is a welcome further
step towards appropriate valuation.
 ""Higher exchange rate flexibility should, however, be
supplemented by structural reforms, especially as their positive
impact is more sustainable,"" he said.

 * Investors batten down for next week's Fed meet
 
(Adds comment, updates throughout; previous TOKYO)
 LONDON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The dollar slipped on Thursday,
relinquishing some of the gains made earlier this week as U.S.
Treasury yields pulled back from a recent rise as investors
continued to recalibrate expectations for U.S. monetary easing.
 Traders said dollar selling by reserve managers against the
euro and other currencies was also helping to push the U.S.
currency down broadly.
 Lower U.S. government bond yields on Thursday narrowed the
spread between the 10-year euro zone and U.S. benchmarks,
putting the brakes on a widening seen in the past week which had
helped to prompt a short-covering rally in the greenback.
 Analysts said rate differentials have been a big driver of
the dollar's move this week, as investors batten down ahead of
the Fed's policy meeting on Nov. 2-3.
 ""Interest rate differentials had stopped moving against the
dollar, but today the dollar is giving up a bit of those gains,""
said Marcus Hettinger, global currency strategist at Credit
Suisse in Zurich.
 ""We're seeing some consolidation in the dollar before the
Fed meeting as no one knows how much QE the Fed might do.""
 The dollar's fate has been closely correlated with U.S.
yields and their gap with rates on other currencies, as
increases in U.S. yields -- other things being equal -- tend to
help the greenback by making dollar investments more attractive.
 A widening in some U.S. yield spreads against other
currencies had been driven by rising Treasury yields as
speculation the Fed may buy more assets to stimulate the economy
has turned into a guessing game of how much they may purchase.
 By 0752 GMT, the euro had risen 0.4 percent on the day to
$1.3815, having climbed to a session high around $1.3850 in
early European trade. This helped to push the dollar 0.4 percent
lower versus a currency basket.
 The euro held above a one-week low around $1.3730 hit on
Wednesday, and many analysts say the continuing gap between euro
zone and U.S. two-year yields means the euro is unlikely to fall
below $1.35 in the coming months.
 ""(The) Fed will confirm that medium-term deflation risks
still justify easing, and with 10-year rates now above Jackson
Hole levels, the resulting rally in bonds should soften the
dollar again,"" JPMorgan analyst Justin Kariya said in a note.
 A Reuters poll showed Wall Street analysts expect the
Federal Reserve to buy between $80 billion and $100 billion
worth of assets per month under a new programme widely expected
to be unveiled on Nov. 3.
 
 DOLLAR/YEN SLIDES
 The dollar fell half a percent to the day's trough of 81.23
yen. The Japanese currency showed little reaction to the Bank of
Japan's decision to hold interest rates virtually at zero while
holding off from new policy initiatives on Thursday.
 Japan's central bank also said it would bring forward its
next policy meeting to Nov. 4-5 from Nov. 15-16.
 The dollar faces strong resistance at 82 yen, which has
blocked its advance several times in recent weeks. Its 21-day
moving average was also at 82 yen on Thursday.
 Except for a short period after Japan intervened in currency
markets on Sept. 15, the dollar has been mostly stuck below the
21-day average line since its decline in June, and a rise above
82 yen could ignite more buybacks in the dollar.
 The New Zealand dollar rose 0.5 percent, brushing aside a
Reserve Bank of New Zealand decision to hold rates steady at 3
percent as investors took comfort from the central bank's

1150,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2010 03:56AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-How rare earths are used in various industries," Oct 28 (Reuters) - Rare earths have stormed to the
forefront of global worries over fears that China's policy of
curbing exports will increasingly cause shortages in other
industrialised economies, given its status as the dominant
global supplier.
 Despite their name, rare earth elements are a relatively
abundant group of 17 chemical elements. They were originally
described as rare because they were unknown in their elemental
form and difficult to extract from the rocks that contained
them.
 Below is a summary of rare earth industrial applications
and some key areas where they are employed:
 Catalysts - Petroleum cracking catalysts and auto catalysts
use lanthanum and cerium.
 Glass - Cerium is the major constituent of this sector,
where it is used in ultra-violet light filtering.
 Polishing - A rapidly growing sector that is based on the
unique chemical and mechanical properties of cerium in the
polishing of glass, including multi-level electronic
components. Metal Alloys - Nickel metal hydride (NiMH)
batteries are the key driver of demand and could put pressure
on lanthanum supply.
 Magnets - Currently, the most dynamic market for rare
earths with growth in demand increasing at 15 percent a year
for the past 10 years, causing neodymium and terbium to
increase by more than 40 percent over the past 12 months
 Phosphors - Necessary for the production of phosphors for
TVs and energy-efficient lamps. This is the smallest sector by
volume (only 6-8 percent) but the largest sector by value
(30-40 percent) as europium and terbium are amongst the least
common rare earths.
 Ceramics - Yttrium stabilised zirconia is used throughout
the resources industry where a material with high-wear
resistance is required.
USES IN DEFENCE INDUSTRIES
Lanthanum night-vision goggles
Neodymium laser range-finders, guidance systems,
communications
Europium fluorescents and phosphors in lamps and monitors
Erbium amplifiers in fiber-optic data transmission
Samarium permanent magnets that are stable at high
temperatures 
Samarium precision-guided weapons
Samarium ""white noise"" production in stealth technology
 MAGNETS
 Rare earth magnets are widely used in wind turbines. Some
large turbines require two short tonnes of rare earth magnets.
These magnets are very strong and make the turbines highly
efficient. Rare earth magnets are used in turbines and
generators in many alternative energy applications.
 HYBRID CAR BATTERIES
 Every hybrid-electric and electric vehicle has a large
battery. Each battery is made using several pounds of rare
earth compounds. The use of electric vehicles is expected to
increase rapidly, driven by energy independence, climate change
and other concerns. This is a key growth area for rare earths.
 MOBILE PHONES, LAPTOPS
 Rechargeable batteries used in mobile phone and portable
computers require rare earths. Rare earths were the key to
smaller more efficient battery technology.

 By Mia Shanley and Sven Nordenstam
 STOCKHOLM/OSLO, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Shares in two top Nordic
banks dipped on Thursday as investors looked beyond
forecast-beating earnings and fretted about underlying growth
prospects ahead.
 Both SEB and DnB NOR reported much better loan books in the
third quarter as the effects of a crippling recession in the
Baltic region faded faster than analysts had foreseen, boosting
profits.
 SEB, the region's fifth-biggest bank, actually clawed back
some money it had previously put aside to cover loan losses.
 But despite the strong results, shares in both lenders eased
as analysts said attention was turning from improved lending
portfolios to future profitability.
 Francis Dallaire, analyst at Ohman Fondkommission,
highlighted core corporate lending at SEB as raising concerns.
 ""What will be the earnings base next year if it isn't
growing, or even decreasing,"" he said.
 SEB's Chief Executive, Annika Falkengren, struck a cautious
tone in the bank's report.
 ""As global macro imbalances continue to hamper a broad-based
economic recovery, uncertainty as to the timing of the pick-up
in corporate credit demand in the Nordic region remains,"" she
said.
 She added that given the sluggish recovery abroad, the
outlook was for lower activity in the Nordic region in 2011.
 Results from rival banking groups Nordea, Swedbank and
Handelsbanken had also set a high bar.
 ""The expectations were already higher given what Swedbank
and Nordea had produced, so this was maybe not good enough,""
said Keefe Bruyette & Woods analyst Ronny Rehn.
 Shares in SEB were down 2.5 percent at 1106 GMT with DnB
Nor, the Nordic region's second biggest bank by market
captalisation, down 1.3 percent, compared with a European flat
banking index. 
 
 
 OUTPERFORMERS
 Nordic banks have outperformed their European peers this
year thanks in large part to their best-in-class capital ratios,
with many staging a dramatic turnaround from 2009 when credit
provisions soared due to a deep downturn in the Baltics.
 DnB NOR said it expected loan losses for 2010 would probably
be lower than the 4-5 billion Norwegian crowns ($679 million to
$848 million) previously forecast.
 SEB's operating earnings in July through September were 2.8
billion Swedish crowns ($414 million), well above the 2.1
billion seen in a Reuters poll and four times the same period a
year ago.
 Recoveries of credit provisions in the period amounted to
196 million crowns compared with the average poll forecast of
further charges of 580 million.
 Loan losses for DnB NOR were 643 million Norwegian crowns in
the third quarter, below the 850 million seen in a Reuters poll.
 DNB also announced it would buy the remaining 49 pecent of
its Baltic and Poland joint venture, DnB NORD, from Germany's
NordLB for 160 million euros ($220.9 million).
 Nordea, the region's biggest lender, Handelsbanken and
Baltic rival Swedbank all beat earnings forecasts in the third
quarter. In addition to the regional recovery, they were helped
by rising official interest rates in Sweden that boosted net
interest income.

 * Export leverage is a closing window of opportunity
 * Domestic hurdles stand in way of China's ambitions
 By Chris Buckley
 BEIJING, Oct 28 (Reuters) - China wants to use its monopoly
over global rare earth supplies to win the race for clean
energy technology that depends on the metals, but it is a
strategy that could backfire, costing Beijing its advantage.
 Japanese companies, which use the metals in hi-tech
products, worry that Beijing is already using its power to
squeeze supplies as a political tool in diplomatic disputes
with Tokyo -- something China denies.
 It has slashed export quotas to about 40 percent below 2009
levels.
 ""I don't think it's political. I think it's strictly
economic,"" said Jon Hykawy, an industry analyst with
Toronto-based Byron Capital Markets, who specialises in rare
and other minerals used in clean technology, referring to
China's export cuts.
 ""Japanese companies are in full panic mode. As far as they
are concerned, this is a red-alert situation,"" said Hykawy.
 China, as other producers have given up environmentally
destructive mining of rare earths, now supplies 97 percent of
the world's demand for the metals, whose magnetic, luminescent
and other qualities make them essential for clean energy,
computers and electronics.
 For a country with a voracious appetite for imported
commodities, it is one over which China can exert control as an
exporter. It now wants the metals for itself for technology
that it can use at home and export.
 It has ambitious goals for advanced wind turbines, hybrid
and electric vehicles and other clean energy innovations that
use rare earth metals.
 The properties of the 17 elements called rare earths also
make them handy for military hardware, where Beijing spends
big.
 ""The biggest driver in the Chinese system is continued job
growth and economic growth, and if they can move a number of
high-value manufacturing jobs in the green sector, as well as a
lot of the intellectual property, to China by swinging the rare
earth hammer, then they're willing to do that,"" said Hykawy.
 COULD BACKFIRE
 Spooking the market, however, could backfire and discourage
companies hungry for the minerals from setting up shop in
China.
 Japan has said it will hurry to secure supplies from
outside China. U.S. lawmakers are backing plans to restart a
shut mine in California. Beijing's advantage could crumble in a
few years.
 ""It's a shrinking window they're dealing with,"" said
Hykawy.
 Transforming the rocks in the ground into clean energy
dominance will not be easy, said John Seaman, a researcher at
the French Institute of International Relations in Paris, who
has studied China's rare earths policies.
 ""I think they are well on their way but still have quite
some distance to go,"" Seaman wrote in emailed answers to
questions.
 ""They may be hammering down on smuggling and illegal
mining, he added. ""But effective, longer term oversight on the
rare earths industry is still a ways away.""
 Rare earths are the MSG of high technology, added in
machines and computers components to boost performance, like
the flavour enhancer used in Chinese restaurants, some Chinese
observers say.
 For years, China treated its rare earth reserves, about 36
percent of currently known mineable global reserves, as cheap
and ubiquitous. Not any more.
 ""Industry insiders joke that we've been selling gold for
the price of carrots,"" said an overview of the rare earths
sector published this month in Macroeconomics, a journal of
Beijing's Academy of Macroeconomic Research, which advises
policy-makers.
 China became strong in rare earths using the recipe it has
for many other industries: state support, cheap labour and
little concern over pollution, illegal mining or smuggling.
 It mined about 120,000 tonnes of rare earths in 2008.
 The United States shut the rare earths mine in California,
unable to compete against cheap Chinese exports. Markets became
used to relying on China.
 ""This happens all the time in China, but because rare
earths is such a small industry, nobody paid attention,"" said
Jack Lifton, co-founder of Technology Metals Research, an
Illinois-based company that follows the area.
 ""We cannot continue to pretend that we're outraged that
China has a monopoly on the supply of rare earths when we're
the ones who gave them that monopoly,"" he said.
 CHEQUE BOOK IN HAND
 The recent political ructions may have been an excuse to
withhold shipments and prod foreign companies to buy more
magnets and other components containing rare earths from China,
and even move production there, said some industry analysts.
 But if new mines open in Australia and elsewhere and
processing and recycling plants also expand, China's bargaining
advantage will be eroded, said Hykawy.
 ""There are some Japanese corporations and some others who
are basically walking around with cheque books in their hands,
saying 'We'll help bankroll these projects as long as we can
get what we need',"" he said.
 Abrupt curtailing of rare earth shipments from China could
make foreign companies more wary of moving there, said Seaman,
the Paris-based researcher.
 ""Companies were already worried about sovereign risk,
relying too much on China for their chains of production.""
 China will also have to contend with homegrown problems
that could stifle efforts to turn rare earths into high-tech
gold.
 Illegal mining has eroded reserves, and smuggling has been
common. Even the legitimate sector remains fragmented and
inefficient, said the Chinese magazine, Macroeconomics.
 ""Our rare earths industry is big yet weak,"" it said. ""The
resource advantage has yet to turn into an economic one.""

 By Chang-Ran Kim, Asia autos correspondent
 TOKYO, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co said on Thursday it
would recall 2.14 million March/Micra, Cube and about a dozen
other models in its third-biggest recall, to fix a faulty
ignition relay that could cause engine problems.
 No accident was reported from the defect, Nissan spokesman
Toshitake Inoshita said.
 Nissan said problems in the ignition relay could cause the
engine to stall or fail to restart. The recalls are mostly in
Japan, with 835,000 units, and the United States and Canada with
a combined 762,000 units.
 The faulty vehicles were built in Japan, the United States,
Britain, Spain, China and Taiwan between August 2003 and July
2006.
 Nissan does not disclose cost estimates on vehicle recalls or
any impact on its earnings. But the fix is likely to be
relatively cheap, with Nissan estimating less than 25 minutes for
the repair, which involves replacing the ignition relay.
 Recalls exceeding 1 million vehicles have become more common
at big automakers as they use common components across multiple
models to save design and production costs.
 Last week, Toyota Motor Corp announced a recall of 1.66
million vehicles globally for defects involving the brake master
cylinder and fuel pump wiring. That brought the total number of
vehicles recalled worldwide at Toyota in the past year to about
14 million.
 Shares of Nissan, held 43 percent by Renault SA, temporarily
erased small gains after the news but later recovered to end up
0.3 percent. Most other auto stocks and the broader Tokyo market
fell.

 STOCKHOLM, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Swedish banking group SEB
posted better-than-expected third-quarter operating profit on
Thursday as the bank clawed back provisions for loan losses in
the crisis-hit Baltic region.
 Operating earnings in July through September were 2.8
billion Swedish crowns ($414 million), well above the 2.1
billion seen in a Reuters poll and four times the 702 million
crowns reported in the same period a year ago.
 Recoveries of credit provisions in the period amounted to
196 million crowns compared with the average poll forecast of
further charges of 580 million and a sharp turnaround from the
639 million charge for loan losses in the previous quarter.
 ""The turnaround in the Baltic economies is even more visible
today, and in combination with falling impaired loans, the
Baltic operations are back in the black,"" Chief Executive Annika
Falkengren said.
 ""The political determination in the region to resolve a
challenging economic situation together with our solid work-out
processes have led to falling non-performing loans,"" she added.
 Risk-averse investors shunned Baltic-exposed players such as
SEB and rival Swedbank during the financial crisis but have
piled back into the shares as emerging market risk has receded
with the global recovery.
 Loan losses have shrunk as the banks scaled back their
exposure to risky markets, while the banks have also been
rewarded for their robust capital levels.
 SEB's results follow forecast-beating earnings from the
region's biggest lender Nordea, and from Swedbank and
Handelsbanken, thanks mainly to stronger core income as the
banks got some relief from rate hikes in Sweden.
 However, like its Nordic peers, SEB was cautious about the
outlook.
 ""As global macro imbalances continue to hamper a broad-based
economic recovery, uncertainty as to the timing of the pick-up
in corporate credit demand in the Nordic region remains,""
Falkengren said.

 * Fund managers focus on Fed monetary policy
 * Cash positions rise as yen strength heightens uncertainty
 By Akiko Takeda and Chikafumi Hodo
 TOKYO, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Japanese fund managers have raised
their weighting for equities to the highest level in 10 months on
views ample liquidity provided by Japanese and U.S. central banks
should allow them to take more risk, a Reuters survey showed.
 Fund managers increased their exposure to stocks reflecting
overall gains in global share prices in the past month in
anticipation that the U.S. Federal Reserve will ease credit
further next week to bolster its struggling economy.
 They cut their exposure to bonds to the lowest since December
as interest rates in developed countries are at low levels, while
the latest move by the Bank of Japan to pump more liquidity to
keep interest rates virtually at zero.
 The persistent strength of the yen continued to hurt
prospects for the export-led Japanese economy, prompting money
managers to raise cash positions in the month.
 ""U.S. shares tend to perform well after a mid-term election.
We need to watch U.S. President (Barack) Obama's policy closely,""
said Kenichi Kubo, a senior fund manager at Tokio Marine Asset
Management, referring to U.S. elections scheduled for Nov. 2.
 ""The market has been pricing in possible quantitative easing
at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting. But share prices
could come under profit-taking pressure if the Fed fails to meet
market expectations on credit easing.""
 Fund managers raised their average weighting for equities in
October for the third straight month to 46.6 percent, the highest
since December, from 45.7 percent the previous month.
 The weighting for bonds fell to 46.8 percent in October from
48.5 percent a month earlier.
 Asset managers' cash positions increased to 3.7 percent after
falling to a low for this year of 2.9 percent in September.
 Their weightings for real estate and alternative assets were
unchanged at 1.3 percent and 1.5 percent respectively.
 The Reuters poll of 13 asset management companies was
conducted on October 14-22 during which Japan's key Nikkei stock
average slipped to a three-week closing low as the yen advanced
to a fresh 15-year peak against the dollar.
 Japanese stocks have faced pressure from the yen, which
firmed to a fresh 15-year high of 80.41 against the dollar on
Monday, approaching a record high of 79.75 yen.
 The 10-year Japanese government bond yield has edged up since
slipping to a seven-year low of 0.820 percent reached earlier in
the month.
 In terms of regional equities allocations, weightings for
Japan jumped 6.3 percentage points to 27.4 percent, the highest
since October 2004, although this was largely due to a change in
the poll's methodology.
 Equities dropped for North America, Britain and Asia, the
poll showed.
 Fund managers' weighting for bonds in Japan also rose, while
exposure to the euro zone, North America, Britain and Asia
dropped.

 * Dollar slips slightly, selling by model player cited
 * BOJ meeting seen having limited impact on yen
 * Kiwi recovers from 3-week low after RBNZ statement
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Oct 28 (Reuters) - A short-covering bounce in the
dollar paused on Thursday, but traders said a rise in U.S.
Treasury yields could prompt more buybacks in the greenback
before the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week.
 U.S. bond yields have risen this week partly as euphoria over
the Fed's likely asset purchase programme is being replaced by
doubts over the size of such a move.
 ""A model player's buying is pushing up the euro in thin
trade. But given that U.S. bond yields have risen, the dollar
will go in the same direction in the near term,"" said a trader at
a Japanese brokerage.
 The dollar's fate has had a close correlation with U.S.
yields and their gap with rates on other currencies, as increases
in U.S. yields -- other things being equal -- tend to help the
greenback by making dollar investments more attractive.
 With the gap between Japan and U.S. two-year yields near a
three-week high and that for 10-year yields at a 2-½ month
high, dollar/yen could have further room to rebound, some traders
said.
 Dollar/yen dipped 0.2 percent on the day to 81.62 yen, but it
was still more than a full yen above Monday's 15-year low of
80.41 yen.
 It faces strong resistance at 82 yen, which has blocked its
advance a few times in recent weeks. Its 21-day moving average
was also at 82 yen on Thursday.
 Except for a short period after Japan intervened in currency
markets on Sept. 15, the dollar has been mostly stuck below the
21-day average line since its decline in June, and a rise above
82 yen could ignite more buybacks in the dollar.
 But market players also note that Japanese exporters, a
growing number of which have recently been lowering their target
levels for selling the dollar, are likely to take advantage of
any rebound in the U.S. currency.
 ""There will be sizable dollar offers from Japanese exporters
at 82 yen and 82.50 yen at the end of month. I expect the
dollar's rebound to be capped around 82.50 yen at best,"" said
Daisuke Karakama, market economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank.
 The Bank of Japan is holding a one-day policy meeting on
Thursday.
 Although it may unveil the details of its 5 trillion yen ($61
billion) asset purchase scheme, it is unlikely to garner much
attention, market players said.
 ""This is peanuts compared to the Fed's $2 trillion balance
sheet,"" said Karakama.
 The euro fetched $1.3811, up 0.3 percent on the day but still
down about 270 pips from Monday's high of $1.4080.
 It may have support at $1.3724, its daily ichimoku kijun
line. Another support level is its Oct. 20 low of $1.3697.
 Many analysts say the gap between euro zone and U.S.
short-term rates means the euro is unlikely to fall below $1.35
in coming months.
 ""We suspect the Fed will confirm that medium-term deflation
risks still justify easing, and with 10-year rates now above
Jackson Hole levels, the resulting rally in bonds should soften
the dollar again,"" JPMorgan analyst Justin Kariya said in report.
 A Reuters poll showed Wall Street analysts expect the Federal
Reserve to buy between $80 billion and $100 billion worth of
assets per month under a new programme widely expected to be
unveiled on Nov. 3.
 The New Zealand dollar, managed to brush aside a Reserve Bank
of New Zealand decision to hold rates steady at 3 percent and
recovered from a three-week low.
 Traders appeared to take comfort from the New Zealand
central bank's remarks that rates would still head higher at
some point. The market expects rates to rise to 4 percent by
the end of next year.
 The kiwi rose to around $0.7475 from a three-week low of
$0.7406 hit just before the statement from the Reserve Bank of
New Zealand.

 SYDNEY, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rebounded on
Thursday after having suffered their biggest one-day fall in
four months, while the yen held firm against a broadly weaker
dollar, taking details of the Bank of Japan's stimulus plan in
its stride.
 European shares took their cue from Asia with London's FTSE
100 index <.FTSE> gaining 0.7 percent at the open and Germany's
DAX <.GDAXI> climbing 0.5 percent. U.S. stock index futures
 were all up between 0.1 and 0.2 percent.
 The BOJ said it would meet next week, bringing forward the
Nov. 15-16 policy meeting to speed up the launch of a 5
trillion yen ($61 billion) asset buying plan aimed at helping
the economy cope with a strong yen.
 It kept interest rates unchanged near zero as widely
expected. [ID:nTOE69R01H]
 ""What stands out is that the BOJ rescheduled its next
meeting, bringing it forward, which suggests the central bank
wants to make sure it can take action if needed after the
FOMC,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin
Research Institute, referring to the U.S. central bank meeting
on Nov. 2-3.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan rose
0.7 percent <.MIAPJ0000PUS>, having slid nearly 2 percent on
Wednesday to post its biggest one-day percentage fall since
late June. Still, it remained close to a 28-month high hit last
week.
 Financial markets have been volatile this week as
speculation intensifies over how much the Federal Reserve is
likely to spend to pump up a faltering recovery and whether
such new measures will be carried out swiftly or phased in over
time.
 Analysts expect choppy market action to persist in the lead
up to next week's meeting.
 Market participants have begun to scale back expectations
of the size of any additional stimulus with The Wall Street
Journal reporting on Wednesday that Fed officials wanted to
avoid a ""shock and awe"" approach. [ID:nTOE69Q02H].
 ""I think the Fed is trying to prepare the market for
incremental QE2 and this whole pre-announcement, in a way, is
to cushion the impact if it comes out on November 3rd that it
is only $100 billion rather than $1-$2 trillion,"" said V.
Anantha-Nageshwaran, CIO of Julius Baer in Hong Kong.
 Asian governments are worried about the impact this might
have on their economy. South Korean Finance Minister Yoon
Jeung-hyun said on Thursday the government needs to guard
against a potential asset bubble caused by excessive liquidity.

Japan's Nikkei stock average <.N225>, which was spared the
selloff seen in the region on Tuesday, slipped 0.2 percent to
end at a six-week low, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index <.HSI>
gained 0.3 percent and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO>
rose 0.8 percent.
 Among the top performers, shares in Canon Inc <7751.T>
rallied more than 3 percent after the world's largest maker of
digital cameras posted strong quarterly results and raised its
full-year outlook.
 In Australia, upbeat earnings helped drive ANZ shares
 up about 3 percent, while bourse operator ASX 
climbed 1.5 percent after two days of sharp losses due to
uncertainty over Singapore Exchange's  $7.9 billion
bid.
 The MSCI's emerging market stock benchmark <.MSCIEF> rose
0.2 percent.
 The selloff in commodities also halted with copper ,
which dropped more than $200 a tonne on Tuesday, its steepest
decline since late June, gaining $30 to $8,330 a tonne.
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  was little changed at
$82.00 per barrel, while spot gold  was also steady near
$1,326.00 an ounce.
 DOLLAR SAGS
 The U.S. dollar eased against a basket of six major
currencies <.DXY> after two straight days of gains helped the
index climb back into positive territory for 2010.
 The euro rose to $1.3833  from $1.3764 late in New
York, while the dollar eased to 81.42 yen  from 81.69
yen, hovering not far from a record low of 79.75 yen.
 The dollar's decline also coincided with a pullback in U.S.
Treasury yields, which gained sharply in the past few sessions
as the market scaled back expectations of the size of Fed's
likely asset purchase programme.
 The U.S. 10-year yield  was last at 2.69
percent, down from a one-month high of 2.73 percent set on
Wednesday.
 ""Overall, we still see the risk for the FOMC next week is
going to be towards U.S. dollar strength once the dust
settles,"" said Sue Trinh, senior currency strategist at RBC
Capital Markets in Hong Kong.
 ""Much of the market is pretty much expecting $100 billion
per month for the next six months or so. So we'll need to see
asset purchases in excess of that in order to generate fresh
U.S. dollar weakness.""

 MEXICO CITY/SAO PAULO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Latin American
stocks fell on Wednesday as investors pulled back bets on how
much stimulus the U.S. Federal Reserve is prepared to pour into
the world's largest economy.
 Market expectations have centered around an initial Fed
commitment to buy at least $500 billion in Treasury debt over
five months. But a Wall Street Journal report on Wednesday said
the amount could be less. [ID:nTOE69Q02H]
 The MSCI Latin American stocks index <.MILA00000PUS>
dropped 0.98 percent. The index has gained more than 11 percent
since Aug. 31 as investors sought equities ahead of the
expected cash injection in the United States.
 Mexico's IPC index lost 0.31 percent after closing at its
fourth consecutive all-time high in the previous session.
 ""There is some apprehension that the stimulus funds could
be less than expected,"" said Carlos Ponce, head of analysis at
brokerage IXE in Mexico City. ""But after eight weeks of gains
on the IPC, a correction is not surprising.""
 Top-weighted America Movil , Latin America's
largest telecommunications company, led losses, down 1.58
percent.
 Santander reduced its rating on the stock to hold from buy
on Tuesday. America Movil has added 5.3 percent this month.
 Cemex, the world's No. 3 cement maker, edged up 0.28
percent after surging 7 percent in the previous session.
 The company posted worse-than-expected results on Tuesday
but won more flexibility from its bankers to pay back debt,
leaving analysts divided on whether to buy or sell.
 Of the nine analysts consulted by Reuters, two have a ""buy""
or ""outperform"" recommendation on Cemex, five have a ""hold"" or
""neutral"" rating, and two have a ""sell"" or ""underperform""
rating. [ID:nN27236494]
 Brazil's Bovespa index <.BVSP> lost 0.24 percent.
 The country's No. 2 private-sector bank, Banco Bradesco
, fell 4.47 percent after reporting third-quarter
profits that beat estimates. Investors bet the bank's profits
were already priced in.
 From the beginning of September, Bradesco's stock rose
nearly 14 percent on the Bovespa.
 OIL RUMOR BOOSTS PETROBRAS
 Non-voting shares of Petrobras  turned positive
during the session as traders speculated that the company would
announce a big oil find after this month's presidential
election.
 Petrobras representatives denied the rumors. The company
did announce on Wednesday that drilling off the coast of
Sergipe state in the northeast turned up signs of a large
deposit of light oil. [ID:nN27216799]
 ""The main news about the company (today) is the oil deposit
in Sergipe,"" said one trader in Sao Paulo who asked not to be
named. ""But people are saying that the real oil discovery news

made by other traders to Reuters.
 Chile's IPSA <.IPSA> rose for the eighth straight day,
adding 0.89 percent to close at a second consecutive life high,

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The dollar rose while stocks
and commodities fell on Wednesday on doubts over how
aggressively the Federal Reserve is going to attempt to
stimulate the flagging U.S. economy.
 Investors had been pricing in large-scale bond purchases by
the Fed. That view lifted equities, commodities and emerging
market assets in recent weeks while the dollar fell because
more Fed injection of funds into the economy via quantitative
easing would lower the currency's value, at least in the short
term.
 ""The dollar's slide since September has been pricing in
aggressive price action by the Fed to around $1 trillion,"" said
Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange.
 But market participants have begun to scale back
expectations of the Fed's intentions. The Wall Street Journal
said on Wednesday that the Fed is likely to unveil an
asset-purchase program worth a few hundred billion dollars over
several months. It said officials want to avoid a ""shock and
awe"" approach in their announcement, expected next week. For
details, see [ID:nTOE69Q02H].
 ""Some stabilization, Fed official comments and the Wall
Street Journal article have resulted in investors' paring back
those aggressive expectations. Given the price action, we can
assume they are trimming those short dollar bets,"" Esiner
said.
 A Reuters survey on Oct. 8 showed U.S. primary dealers
expected the size of the quantitative easing to be between $500
billion and $1.5 trillion.

 Also, the government's sale of $35 billion in five-year

29/32, with the yield at 4.0555 percent.
 Gold prices  fell $14.10, or 1.05 percent, to

the dollar strengthens, and vice versa, as a firmer U.S.

 NEW YORK, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The dollar's rise on Wednesday
pushed it into positive territory against major currencies for
the year as investors continued to unwind bets against the
greenback before a highly anticipated Federal Reserve meeting.
 The U.S. central bank has telegraphed several times that it
will attempt to boost growth by pumping more money into the
economy through government bond purchases, and that has pushed
the dollar and U.S. bond yields lower in recent months.
 But the anti-dollar trend started to stall this week over
questions about how much the Fed will spend and whether the new
measures will be carried out swiftly or phased in over time.
 The dollar rebound tracked a rise in U.S. bond yields and a
narrowing of the gap between them and rates in Germany and
Japan. By Wednesday, an index of the dollar against six major
currencies <.DXY>, was back in positive territory for 2010.
 Primary dealers polled by Reuters last week were
anticipating the Fed would buy at least $500 billion of
Treasuries [FED/R]. Those expectations have been since been
scaled back.See [ID:nN25168493] and [ID:nTOE69Q02H].
 ""Whether they (the Fed) actually give a size for the amount
of stimulus is questionable,"" said Anthony King, managing
director of investment grade fixed income at PineBridge
Investments in London. PineBridge Investments manage more than
US $78 billion in assets.
 ""That's why the dollar has strengthened somewhat this week
because market commentators had been leaning too far in the
other direction,"" King said.
 The Fed will hold its next policy meeting on Nov. 2-3.
 The dollar hit a two-week high just shy of 82 yen 
and a one-week peak at $1.3735 per euro , with the
European currency also undermined by euro zone banks taking up
more cheap funding than expected at a three-month ECB tender
[ID:nLDE69Q0XN].
 It last changed hands down 0.7 percent at $1.3759, though
some traders said a test of last week's low around $1.3695
couldn't be ruled out.
 DOLLAR BOOST IN 2011?
 Many analysts say the gap between euro zone and U.S.
short-term rates means the euro is unlikely to fall below $1.35
in coming months. Investors expect the European Central Bank to
withdraw some stimulus measures as the Fed eases, which should
keep euro zone interest rates higher than U.S. rates.
 King said the euro could rebound after the Fed ends the
suspense next week, but predicted gains would be limited.
 ""It's possible we could see $1.45 versus the euro. But I
wouldn't expect us to overshoot much more than that,"" he said.
[ID:nN27253865]
 Some analysts say looser U.S. policy will help the U.S.
economy grow faster than the euro zone's, which could struggle
in 2011 as governments try to put public finances in order with
strict spending cuts and higher taxes. [ID:nN27213289]

 CAPITAL CONTROLS
 Uncertainty about Fed policy isn't helping global
policymakers, particularly in fast-growing emerging markets.
 China, Brazil and others have complained that Fed policy
was stoking inflation by pushing money away from the dollar and
into their fast-growing economies. China's commerce minister
said dollar issuance by the United States was ""out of control.""
{ID:nLDE69P2DK]
 Some emerging market governments have felt compelled to try
to slow inflows with taxes on investment and other capital
controls, and analysts said more moves in that direction could
limit dollar losses.
 The Korean won  fell more than 1 percent Wednesday
after comments from the country's central banker provoked
speculation that the government may turn to capital controls
[ID:nSEL003184].
 ""Everyone is ready to go it alone, and the problem is that
nobody really has any clue what the Fed is going to do,"" said
Brown Brothers Harriman strategist Mark McCormick.
 The Australian dollar, in demand because of its high
interest rates and trade links with emerging Asia, fell 1.6
percent to $0.9701 . Softer-than-expected inflation
data contributed to the currency's decline, traders said.

 TORONTO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar retreated
against the U.S. currency on Wednesday as the greenback rose
broadly on speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve would take a
measured approach to quantitative easing.

another round of asset-buying to stimulate a faltering recovery
also weighed on global equities and commodities. [MKTS/GLOB]
 ""It comes down to the U.S. dollar, and the U.S. dollar
strength or weakness is simply a barometer of the market's
assumption around quantitative easing at the next Fed meeting,""
said Jack Spitz, managing director of foreign exchange at
National Bank Financial.
 ""The current market position is to be short U.S. dollars
and the U.S. dollar's gains over the past few days have
reflected a pulling back of risk,"" he said.
 The Canadian dollar  ended at C$1.0287 to the U.S.

C$1.0242 to the U.S. dollar, or 97.64 U.S. cents.
 The U.S. central bank has aired several times that it will
attempt to boost growth by pumping more money into the economy
through government bond purchases, commonly referred
to as quantitative easing. That has pushed the dollar and U.S.

 But the greenback reversed course this week on uncertainty
about how much the Fed will spend and whether the new measures

 By Samantha Pearson and Caroline Stauffer
 SAO PAULO/MEXICO CITY, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Brazil and
Chile's currencies sank to their weakest in more than a month
on Wednesday on fears that U.S. stimulus measures may not boost
the countries' debt markets as much as thought.
 Argentina's credit markets rallied after news that former
Argentine President Nestor Kirchner, the current president's
husband and a contender to succeed her in next year's election,
died from a heart attack. His unorthodox economic policies have
long caused resentment among investors.
 But most investors kept their eyes on events in the United
States. The U.S. Federal Reserve is likely next week to unveil
a program of U.S. Treasury bond purchases worth a few hundred
billion dollars over several months, the Wall Street Journal
reported on Wednesday. That rattled some investors, who had
envisioned a bigger and more immediate stimulus package.
 Investors have been banking on those measures to keep U.S.
yields low and bring a deluge of cash to Latin America's
higher-yielding bonds.
 Brazil is a prime target since its benchmark interest rate
of 10.75 percent is one of the highest in the world.
 The Brazilian real  closed 0.94 percent lower at
1.720 reais per U.S. dollar on the local spot market, hitting
its weakest level since Sept. 23.
 ""There is some uncertainty over the Fed's policy next
week,"" said Carlos Gandolfo, a partner at Sao Paulo's Pioneer
brokerage.
 Traders were also concerned that fresh measures to curb a
recent rally in the real, which has hurt exporters and the
current account deficit, could be announced after Sunday's
presidential run-off election.


 However, such measures are likely to have a ""limited impact
if they are not accompanied by policies that open the door to a
solution to the fundamental problem caused by Brazil's high
interest rates,"" analysts at IEDI, an industry-funded economic
think tank in Sao Paulo, wrote in a note.
 Meanwhile, the Mexican currency  weakened 0.67
percent to 12.475 per dollar after trading at multi-month highs
earlier this week.
 The Chilean peso  lost 0.63 percent to 494.4 per
dollar, hitting its weakest level since Sept. 22.
 While Mexico's finance minister said the country is not
losing export competitiveness due to recent currency gains, the
situation is very different in Chile. [ID:nN27223162]
 A backlash from exporters has put intense pressure on the
government to curb the Chilean peso's rally. Earlier this week,
Chile announced plans to open capital accounts and relax limits
on investments abroad to curb inflows. But traders are
concerned that more aggressive measures are on their way.
[ID:nN20242719]
 KIRCHNER'S DEATH PROMPTS RALLY
 Argentine markets were the exception on an otherwise
downbeat day. The country's shares and bonds rose sharply after
the death of Kirchner removed from the 2011 election campaign a
contender seen as unfriendly to markets. [ID:nN27233091]
 Investors immediately bid higher Argentine credit and
equity-related assets following the news, but volumes were low
due to a local holiday.
 ""The legacy of the Kirchner Administration clearly reflects
market interventionism and antagonism with the private sector,""
said Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America strategy at RBS
Securities in Stamford, Connecticut.

undermined by euro zone banks taking up more cheap funding than
expected at a three-month ECB tender [ID:nLDE69Q0XN].
 Traders said the break below $1.3750 could prompt a test of
last week's low around $1.3695.
 DOLLAR BOOST IN 2011?
 Many analysts say the gap between euro zone and U.S.
short-term rates means the euro is unlikely to fall below $1.35
in coming months. Investors expect the European Central Bank to
withdraw some stimulus measures as the Fed eases, which should
keep euro zone interest rates higher than U.S. rates.
 King said the euro could rebound after the Fed ends the
suspense next week, but predicted gains would be limited.
 ""It's possible we could see $1.45 versus the euro. But I
wouldn't expect us to overshoot much more than that,"" he said.
 Some analysts say looser U.S. policy will help the U.S.
economy grow faster than the euro zone's, which could struggle
in 2011 as governments try to put public finances in order with
strict spending cuts and higher taxes. [ID:nN27213289]

 CAPITAL CONTROLS
 But uncertainty about that policy isn't helping global
policymakers, particularly those in fast-growing emerging
markets.
 China, Brazil and others have complained that Fed policy
was stoking inflation by pushing money away from the dollar and
into their fast-growing economies.
 These issues were prominent among discussions at a G20
meeting last week, at which finance leaders pledged not to
devalue their currencies for economic advantage.
 But some emerging markets have felt compelled to try to
slow inflows with taxes on investment and other capital
controls, and analysts said more moves in that direction could
limit dollar losses.
 The Korean won  fell more than 1 percent Wednesday
after comments from the country's central banker provoked
speculation that the government may turn to capital controls
[ID:nSEL003184].
 ""Everyone is ready to go it alone, and the problem is that
nobody really has any clue what the Fed is going to do,"" said
Brown Brothers Harriman strategist Mark McCormick.
 The Australian dollar, in demand because of its high
interest rates and trade links with emerging Asia, fell 1.7
percent to $0.9688 . Softer-than-expected inflation
data contributed to the currency's decline, traders said.

 * Dollar index higher year to date with Wednesday's gain
 * Dollar rises to 2-week high vs yen, 1-wk high vs euro
 * Fed eyes gradual bond buys-WSJ 
 (Updates prices, adds details, adds quotes)
 NEW YORK, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the
euro and yen on Wednesday, pushing the dollar index higher year
to date, as investors eased short bets against the currency
ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting.
 While Fed meetings are always of paramount interest, the
coming statement is more anticipated than usual given the
central bank has telegraphed several times it will add to the
liquidity in the system to stoke economic growth through
additional quantitative easing.
 The question now is by how much and whether the new
measures will be phased in over time?
 Some investors are more willing to take bets on the dollar
on expectations the U.S. economy will gain traction from QE,
particularly compared with other regions such as the euro zone.
For an analysis, click.
 The Wall Street Journal reported the Fed would make bond
purchases worth a few hundred billion dollars over several
months, which compared with investors' base-case scenario for
an initial commitment to buy at least $500 billion.
 In a Reuters survey earlier this month, U.S. primary
dealers' projections for the size of the Fed's expected
quantitative easing at its Nov. 2-3 policy meeting ranged from
$500 billion to $1.5 trillion.
 The dollar hit a two-week high against the yen and a
one-week peak versus the euro, which was also knocked by euro
zone banks taking up more cheap funding than expected at a
three-month ECB tender.
 The greenback jumped against the Australian dollar and hit
a one-month high against the Swiss franc.
 ""Whether they (the Fed) actually give a size for the amount
of stimulus is questionable,"" said Anthony King, managing
director of investment grade fixed income at PineBridge
Investments in London. PineBridge Investments manage more than
US $78 billion in assets. ""That's why the dollar has
strengthened somewhat this week because market commentators had
been leaning too far in the other direction.""
 If the Fed announcement is largely as expected, the dollar
is likely to weaken in coming days.
 ""Having that news (of easing) confirmed would likely weaken
the dollar a little further,"" King said. ""It's possible we
could see $1.45 versus the euro. But I wouldn't expect us to
overshoot much more than that.""
 The $1.4500 target is for a month after Wednesday's
meeting.
 EURO FALLS
 Midway through the New York session, the euro was down 0.5
percent at $1.3784. It fell as low as $1.3758 on electronic
trading platform EBS after triggering stop loss orders at
$1.3770. The break of an option barrier at $1.3800 accelerated
selling earlier in the global day.
 The dollar trimmed gains versus the euro after data showing
U.S. durable goods orders rose more than expected in September
though it then extended gains after a separate report showed
U.S. new home sales rose more than expected the same month. For
details see and.
 Traders reported bids were expected around $1.3750/60. A
break of $1.3750 could prompt a test of last week's low around
$1.3695.
 Many analysts believe the gap between euro zone and U.S.
short-term rates, reflecting QE expectations from the Fed while
the ECB gradually withdraws liquidity, will mean the euro is
unlikely to fall below $1.35 in the next month or two
particularly while investors wait to see the impact of the Fed
measures.
 DOLLAR SUPPORTED
 The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the
greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up
0.4 percent at 77.984 and is up 0.2 percent year to date at
current prices.
 Against the yen, the dollar rose as high as 81.99 yen on
electronic trading platform EBS, pulling further away from a
15-year low of 80.41 yen struck earlier this week. It last
traded at 81.53 yen.
 The Aussie dollar was down 1.5 percent at $0.9702, dented
by a smaller-than-expected rise in Australian consumer prices
last quarter which was seen reducing chances of future interest
rate hikes.
 Spot yuan closed down against the dollar on Wednesday after
the People's Bank of China set another weaker mid-point in a
move seen aimed at curbing mounting speculation of further yuan
appreciation..

 * Georgian leader: we'll keep objecting as long as it takes
 * As existing WTO member, Georgia can veto Russian accession

(adds background)
 By Lamine Ghanmi
 MARRAKESH, Morocco, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Georgia will keep up
its objections to Russia's accession to the World Trade
Organisation (WTO) for as long as necessary, Georgian President
Mikheil Saakashvili told Reuters on Wednesday.
 As an existing member of the trade bloc, Georgia can veto
Russia's long-delayed accession. But to do that risks irritating
ally the United States, which backs Russia's entry to the WTO as
part of a plan to ""re-set"" troubled relations with Moscow.
 Georgia -- which fought a brief war with Russia in 2008 --
says Moscow should not be admitted to the organisation until it
has agreed to a deal with Tbilisi over customs controls on the
internationally recognised border between the two countries.
 ""We still do not see much will from Russia to reach out to
us,"" Saakashvili said in an interview when asked about Georgia's
position on the Russian WTO entry bid.
 ""We are ready for serious, meaningful talks about the issues
but we have certain issues that cannot be overlooked and cannot
be overcome by neglect,"" he said.
 ""I think the Georgian issues are still there. We will stick
to our principles for as long as it takes,"" Saakashvili said on
the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on the Middle East and
North Africa, in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh.
 Russia has been negotiating membership of the WTO for 17
years, and is the biggest economy still outside the 153-member
group, which acts as a referee in global trade disputes.
 Its membership bid has picked up momentum in the past few
months after U.S. President Barack Obama expressed his
commitment to Russia joining the WTO.
 Obama administration officials have spoken of a desire to
""re-set"" relations with Russia after ties sunk to a post-Cold
War low under the previous administration because of rows over
missile defence systems, Iraq and the war with Georgia.

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The dollar rose and stocks and
commodities fell on Wednesday on doubts over how aggressively
the Federal Reserve is going to attempt to stimulate the
flagging U.S. economy.
 Investors had been pricing in large-scale bond purchases by
the Fed, which lifted equities, commodities and emerging market
assets in recent weeks while the dollar fell because more Fed
quantitative easing would lower the currency's value, at least
in the short term.
 ""The dollar's slide since September has been pricing in
aggressive price action by the Fed to around $1 trillion,"" said
Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange.
 But market participants have begun to scale back
expectations of the Fed's intentions. The Wall Street Journal
said on Wednesday that the Fed is likely to unveil an
asset-purchase program worth a few hundred billion dollars over
several months. It said officials want to avoid a ""shock and
awe"" approach in their announcement, expected next week. For
details, see [ID:nTOE69Q02H].
 ""Some stabilization, Fed official comments and the Wall

those aggressive expectations. Given the price action, we can
assume they are trimming those short dollar bets,"" Esiner
said.
 A Reuters survey on Oct. 8 showed U.S. primary dealers
expected the size of the quantitative easing to be between $500
billion and $1.5 trillion.

1182,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2010 12:28PM ET</span>","INTERVIEW-EU firms have problem with fx volatility, manipulation"," By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, Oct 27 (Reuters) - European companies are ready to
accept the euro's rise if it is the result of market forces, but
have difficulty coping with exchange rate volatility and
currency manipulation, Europe's top business group said.
 Philippe de Buck, Director General of BusinessEurope, an
organisation representing 20 million European firms, said
companies are not yet complaining about the strength of the
euro, which rose 12 percent to above $1.4 in mid-October.
 The euro also strengthened 9.4 percent against the Japanese
yen in the month to mid-October.
 ""We are used to living with a stronger euro,"" de Buck told
Reuters in an interview on the eve of a European Union summit
that will hammer out a message to the leaders of the G20 biggest
developed and developing economies.
 ""We have also warned that there are some limits, when we
were close to $1.6 we have certainly passed the pain threshold,""
he said.
 He said that more than the level of the exchange rate, it
was the speed with which it had changed that posed a problem.
 ""What is important is not necessarily the level of the euro.
For us, European businesses, there are two things: firstly the
volatility, the ups and downs, because this is very difficult to
manage for companies,"" he said.
 ""Secondly it is of course the manipulation of currencies,
and that we see starting to happen, be it in Japan, or be it in
the U.S.,"" he said.
 Japan intervened on the market to weaken the rising yen to
protect its exports and the United States raised the possibility
of further quantitative easing of monetary policy, which sent
the dollar sharply lower.
 ""We are prepared to live with currencies that become
stronger ... but we want this to be done by market forces, not
by intervention of politicians, to make it easier for exporters
to export their products,"" de Buck said.
 Draft conclusions of the EU summit on Thursday showed Europe
would call on other in the G20 not to use exchange rates to gain
competitive advantage.
 ""Conclusions are always compromises, it is what they say in
the meetings that is important,"" de Buck said, adding the
leaders should reinforce the message renouncing competitive
devaluations agreed on by G20 finance ministers last week.
 De Buck, who will meet EU leaders on Thursday to deliver his
message, said he would ask them to keep the pressure on
countries to consolidate budgets because there would be no
economic growth without sound public finances.
 ""That some concessions are made here and there, if that is
absolutely needed, we say OK, but what is absolutely key is not
to lower the pressure on countries to make those efforts,"" he
said.
 EU leaders will also discuss the option of changing the EU
treaty, the 27-nation bloc's main law, to accommodate the
possibility of creating a permanent mechanism for crisis
resolution which could involve a default of a euro zone country.
 De Buck said treaty changes were lengthy affairs, while the
EU needed workable solutions quickly.
 ""If it takes 10 years, it is of no use at all, we are in an
urgent situation,"" he said.
 He also expressed concern that a watering down of a reform
of EU budget rules, which retained political discretion in
decisions to penalise rule-breakers, could open the door for
unequal treatment of EU countries depending on their size.
 The revision of EU budget rules is the second one since the
euro was created in 1999, after France and Germany triggered the
first one in 2005 by refusing to accept a stepping up of a
disciplinary EU budget procedure against them.
 ""I am a lawyer, I look at case law -- what happened in
2003-2004 is for us a very important signal -- we were very
worried at the time that large countries can always find a
better way out than the others,"" de Buck said.

 * Egyptian exporters' stocks seen rising on lower pound
 * Q3 earnings still driving markets
 
 By Patrick Werr
 CAIRO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Egypt's pound is expected to face
more selling pressure next week as foreign investors dump the
currency ahead of upcoming elections, but the central bank may
intervene to stop any sharp declines from fuelling inflation.
 In the Gulf, where most currencies are pegged to the U.S.
dollar, stock markets had their best month in over a year in
September and gains could extend through October if the U.S.
Federal Reserve announces a new round of economic stimulus.
 Egypt's pound had been attracting foreign investors for the
past year; they bought treasury bills at higher yields than
those offered in developed markets where economic growth remains
sluggish and interest rates are at historic lows. This trend
has been reversed after a large sell-off of T-bills weakened the
pound to 5.7740 to the dollar on Oct. 26, its lowest level in
five years.
 ""We believe (the pound) will face further temporary downward
pressure as the yield on three-month T-bills reverses its trend
and some foreign investors continue to exit the T-bill market,""
J.P. Morgan said in recent research note.
 ""We believe the central bank will likely accelerate its
intervention in the foreign exchange market again especially if
(the pound) weakens to 5.79 (against the dollar)"".
 Some traders said the central bank might be buying dollars
and letting the pound weaken to make Egypt's exports more
attractive. They also said the bank might be building reserves
to cope with any market volatility before parliamentary
elections on Nov. 28 and presidential elections in 2011.
 No one doubts President Hosni Mubarak's ruling party will
dominate both races, but the polls are being watched to see how
much space is given to the opposition and, more crucially,
whether the 82-year-old president seeks another term next year.
 However, with inflation running at 11 percent, the Egyptian
government is loath to let the currency fall too much before
elections out of concern it could push up the price of imported
goods, especially foodstuffs, even faster.
 The Egyptian pound is also likely to pick up against the
dollar as the fourth quarter progresses because widely-expected
quantitative easing measures (QE2) in the United States will
accelerate capital flows to higher interest rate emerging
markets, CI Capital Research said in a note on Tuesday.
 ""We believe the recent depreciation will be of a short-term
nature -- which should be intensified with the upcoming November
elections,"" it said.
 ""As QE2 materializes, more capital should flow into the
economy which should shift such depreciation pattern.""
 
 EGYPTIAN EQUITIES
 Analysts said the lower pound could boost the shares of some
exporters listed on the Egyptian stock market, though investors
will focus more on earnings. Most Egyptian companies report
their third quarter results in the first two weeks of November.
 ""The market will be looking at ... banks' results in the
early weeks of November. Expectations are high for bank loan
growth,"" Simon Kitchen, a strategist with EFG-Hermes, said.
 ""Overall, the Egyptian market will continue to take a lead
from global markets, though retail activity and rich valuations
for blue-chips will mean that smaller cap names outperform.""
 The lower pound is seen helping exporters such as sanitary
ware maker Lecico, machine carpet maker Oriental Weavers and
clothes maker Arafa.
 Investors will also keeping a close eye on the fate of
Orascom Telecom's Algerian unit Djezzy.
 The Algerian government plans to nationalise Djezzy, but
says it will not begin talks with Orascom until next year,
casting fresh doubt on a $6.6 billion deal for Vimpelcom to buy
Orascom assets. Investors will also be watching for any sign
of leniency by the Algerian government on its recent claim that
Djezzy owes $230 million in back taxes for 2008 and 2009.
 
 GULF MARKETS
 In the Gulf, stock markets including Dubai and Abu Dhabi
have extended stellar gains from last month into October.
 Gulf markets are seen benefitting from widely-expected U.S.
Federal Reserve plans to unveil a new round of ""quantitative
easing"", to pump more money into the economy. 
 Any such move could push the dollar lower, which in turn
would raise the price of crude oil exports, which are priced in
the greenback and on which most Gulf Arab countries depend.
 ""Focus continues to be on Fed comments ahead of the Nov. 3
FOMC meeting,"" said Ajeev Gopinath, associate vice president for
asset management at Gulf Baader Capital Markets in Muscat.
 Earnings will drive markets for another week, with regional

 Libya's stock exchange may get a boost due to comments made
by its chairman, who said 20 new companies could be listed in
2011, including two mobile telephone operators, al Madar and
Libyana. Libya has been gradually opening up its economy, and
some foreign analysts say it has the potential to become a
regional financial hub, but more reforms as well as a more
predictable regulatory environment are needed before that can
happen.

 * Dollar rises to 2-week high vs yen, 1-wk high vs euro
 * Fed eyes gradual bond buys; several hundred bln dlrs-WSJ
(Updates prices, adds comment, changes dateline, previous
LONDON)
 NEW YORK, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the
euro and yen on Wednesday, leaving the dollar index little
changed year to date, as investors eased short bets against the
currency ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting.
 While Fed meetings are always of paramount interest, the
coming statement is more anticipated than usual given the
central banks has telegraphed several times that it will add to
the liquidity in the system to stoke economic growth through
additional quantitative easing.
 The only questions now are by how much and whether the new
measures will be implemented over time or phased in.
 With expectations that QE will be implemented in steps,
some investors are more willing to take bets on the dollar if
it gains traction, the QE will bolster the economic outlook
compared with other regions such as the euro zone.
 And The Wall Street Journal reported the Fed would make
bond purchases worth a few hundred billion dollars over several
months, which compared with investors' base-case scenario for
an initial commitment to buy at least $500 billion.
 The dollar hit a two-week high against the yen and a
one-week peak versus the euro, which was also knocked by euro
zone banks taking up more cheap funding than expected at a
three-month ECB tender.
 The greenback jumped against the Australian dollar too and
hit a one-month high against the Swiss franc.
 ""The dollar's slide since September has been pricing in
aggressive price action by the Fed to around $1 trillion,"" said
Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange. ""Some stabilization, Fed official comments and the
Wall Street Journal article have resulted in investors paring
back those aggressive expectations. Given the price action we
can assume they are trimming those short dollar bets.""
 In a Reuters survey earlier this month, U.S. primary
dealers' projections for the size of the Fed's expected
quantitative easing at its Nov. 2-3 policy meeting ranged from
$500 billion to $1.5 trillion.
 In early New York trade, the euro was down 0.3 percent at
$1.3820. It earlier fell as low as $1.3770 on electronic
trading platform EBS as a break of an option barrier at $1.3800
accelerated selling.
 The dollar trimmed gains versus the euro on Wednesday after
data showing U.S. durable goods orders rose more than expected
in September, though they fell when transportation equipment
was excluded.
 Traders reported central banks and other major players
looking to buy the euro on dips below $1.38. Bids were expected
around $1.3750/60. A break of $1.3750 could prompt a test of
last week's low around $1.3695.
 Many analysts believe the gap between euro zone and U.S.
short-term rates, reflecting QE expectations from the Fed while
the ECB gradually withdraws liquidity, will mean the euro is
unlikely to fall below $1.35 in the next month or two
particularly while investors wait to see the impact of the Fed
measures.
 DOLLAR SUPPORTED
 The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the
greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up
0.2 percent at 77.864 and is moving back and forth between
marginal gains and losses for the year to date.
 Against the yen, the dollar rose as high as 81.99 yen on
electronic trading platform EBS, pulling further away from a
15-year low of 80.41 yen struck earlier this week. It last
traded at 81.60 yen.
 Traders said a fair amount of overnight 82.00 yen strikes
were bought on Tuesday, suggesting that area could act as
resistance going into Wednesday's 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) cut --
when many trades expire. Option-related stops were then
highlighted at 82.15 yen.
 The Aussie dollar was down 1.3 percent at $0.9720, dented
by a smaller-than-expected rise in Australian consumer prices
last quarter which was seen as reducing the chances of future
interest rate hikes.
 Spot yuan closed down against the dollar on Wednesday after
the People's Bank of China set another weaker mid-point in a
move seen aimed at curbing mounting speculation of further yuan
appreciation..

1196,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2010 08:24AM ET</span>",New Novo insulin fails to knock out rival Sanofi," * Head-to-head trial finds degludec similar to Lantus
 * Trend to less hypoglycaemia, but not significant
 * Further degludec results due later this year and 2011
 
 By Ben Hirschler 
 LONDON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Rival drugmakers Novo Nordisk
and Sanofi-Aventis still have all to play for in the
multibillion-dollar long-acting insulin market after a new
product from the Danish group failed to show a clear edge.
 Degludec, which Novo hopes to launch in 2013, was developed
as an improvement over existing long-acting insulins, capable of
delivering equivalent or better blood sugar control with fewer
episodes of dangerously low blood sugar levels.
 In fact, results of a head-to-head study against Sanofi's
Lantus released on Wednesday showed comparable reductions in
blood glucose levels and only a trend towards lower risk of
hypoglycaemia, which was not statistically significant.
 Novo reported the results of the six-month Phase III trial
alongside better-than-expected third-quarter results.
 Mark Clark, an industry analyst at Deutsche Bank, said the
fact degludec and Lantus were essentially equivalent was
positive for Sanofi, which generated revenue of 3.08 billion
euros ($4.3 billion) from Lantus in 2009.
 The French group is particularly reliant on Lantus because
it faces a wave of patent expiries on other blockbuster
medicines. That big patent ""cliff"" is a key reason behind its
$18.5 billion bid for U.S. biotech group Genzyme, as it hunts
additional sources of revenue.
 ""Although there are further head-to-head studies due to
report end-2010 and early-2011, today's data makes us more
confident Lantus has substantial growth ahead of it,"" Clark
said.
 He expects Lantus sales to reach nearly 5 billion euros in
2015, equivalent to some 15 percent of group sales.
 Emmanuel Papadakis of Collins Stewart also said the latest
clinical trial results would not dispel scepticism over
degludec's prospects.
 Novo shares were 1.4 percent higher by 1130 GMT, as results
of the degludec study took some of the shine off its impressive
financial performance. Sanofi was up 0.3 percent, while the
broader European drugs sector added 0.4 percent.
 The world's biggest insulin maker, the Danish company is
banking on degludec to consolidate its market lead in the years
ahead, when it faces the risk of competition from cheaper
so-called biosimilar versions of some of its products.
 The new insulin is a challenger not only to Lantus but also
Novo's own best-selling long-acting insulin, Levemir.
 Novo still has other opportunities to prove it has a better
product as results from larger and long-lasting clinical studies
come in this year and next.

 * Says 6.5 percent growth needed to curb unemployment 
 * Region ""should shift trade away from low-growth Europe""
 By Lamine Ghanmi 
 MARRAKESH, Morocco, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Economies in the
Middle East and North Africa need to accelerate their
post-slowdown growth if they are to reduce jobless numbers, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) regional chief said.
 He said countries in the region would emerge from the global
downturn with growth of just under 5 percent next year --
stronger than in mature economies -- but structural reform was
needed if sufficient new jobs are to be created.
 ""MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region growth will be
at a rate of 4.2 percent this year versus 2.3 percent in 2009
and the growth will be 4.8 percent next year,"" Masood Ahmed,
Director of the IMF's Middle East and Central Asia Department,
told Reuters in an interview.
 The growth was driven by higher oil revenues and rising
state investment in oil-exporting states and ""rapid and
efficient"" government measures in the area's emerging countries
like Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia, he said.
 ""The average rate in the four emerging countries was at
around 4.5 percent last year and will be 5 percent this year,""
he said late on Tuesday on the sidelines of the World Economic
Forum on the Middle East and North Africa.
 But he said: ""The growth in these countries must be 6.5
percent and higher rather than 4.5 percent or 5 percent to
reduce unemployment.""
 ""MENA's emerging markets should create 18 million jobs in
the next 10 years to cut unemployment,"" said Ahmed.
 The IMF estimates that the overall jobless rate in the
region last year stood at 12 percent compared to 4.5 percent in
East Asia and 7 percent in South Asia.
 High birth rates and youthful populations mean that more
people are joining the ranks of the unemployed all the time.
 Ahmed said the Middle East and North Africa should
shift the emphasis in external trade away from traditional
partners in Europe, where he said annual growth is expected to
be between 1.5 and 2 percent in the next five years.
 Instead, they should focus on trade with emerging markets
where growth will be up to to 8 percent, he said.
 ""That trend has begun with the rise in exports of raw
materials to emerging markets but the emphasis must be on
diversifying exports to integrate the region and its enterprises
in the global supply chain,"" said Ahmed.

 * Threat of bubble looms as new suppliers gear up
 * BlackRock unconvinced of rare earths' staying power
 By James Regan
 SYDNEY, Oct 27 (Reuters) - China's increasing reluctance to
supply the rest of the world with rare earths is whipping up a
gold rush-like frenzy to find new producers of the elements
needed to manufacture everything from high-tech weapons to
mobile phones.
 Producers and would-be producers are forging new supply
pacts with consumers, and investors are scooping up shares in
mining companies promising to replace the lost Chinese
material.
 But the ultra-quick global push to find alternative
supplies also has investors asking if a classic commodities
bubble is in the making.
 The world's biggest money manager, BlackRock Inc, thinks
it's possible.
 ""The ability to bring on production quickly in the
higher-price environment means that the longer-term
sustainability of those prices are questionable,"" Catherine
Raw, a fund manager in BlackRock's natural-resources division,
said on Wednesday.
 ""We are trying to invest on a three to five-year view, and
longer, to identify where you can see long-term structural
increases in commodities,"" Raw said.
 ""The jury on rare earths is still out.""
 PRICES UP
 The price hikes in rare earths has been meteoric: Cerium,
widely used in glass-making is up nearly tenfold since 2009.
Prices of neodymium and terbium, needed to make magnets, are up
more than 40 percent.
 This has propelled shares of Lynas Corp and Molycorp Inc.,
the biggest non-Chinese rare earth firms, to more than double
since July, when China announced it was reducing exports by 72
percent in the second half.
 Stock in Arafura Resources Ltd, another promising producer,
has more than tripled in just a few months. Beijing
says it simply needs to conserve its mine reserves of rare
earths for future domestic consumption or it will run out.
 Others say it is using rare earths as a trade axe.
 China, which produces 97 percent of the world's rare
earths, last month halted shipments to Japan after a
long-simmering territorial dispute with Tokyo flared.
 ""Strategic concerns overall towards China are shaping or
increasing the level of worry over these export quotas,"" said
Malcolm Cook, East Asia programme director for the Lowy
Institute for International Policy in Sydney.
 The European Union and the United States on Tuesday said
they were pressing for solutions to concerns China may be
exploiting its stranglehold on rare earth metals.
 Regardless of China's motives, its future commitment to
exporting rare earth products remains questionable, leaving the
rest of the world looking for 40,000-50,000 tonnes of material
a year at today's consumption rate.
 ""The basic issue is that China needs to use the rare earths
for domestic demand first and the left over amount can go to
other countries,"" said Amy Lee, an analyst at Nomura in Hong
Kong.
 ""They are concerned about the limited rare earths in China,
so they need to control it.""
 There are at least two mines outside of China nearing the
production stage and poised to address much of the shortfall:
Molycorp's Mountain Pass in California and Lynas' Mt Weld in
Australia, which together will have the capacity to meet at
least two-thirds of non-China world demand within three years.
 Potentially another 115,000 tonnes coming from Canada to
Australia to Greenland is in various stages of pre-development.
And as more uranium mines are dug worldwide, consumers can
expect additional supplies as by-products, particularly in
Australia and Kazakhstan.
 ""I think the supply response is well under way,"" said
Andrew Driscoll, head of resources research at CLSA. On
top of that, Driscoll believes there are three to four
consumers in Japan investing in as many as six projects outside
of China to become self-sufficient in the future.
 Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan this month agreed with
Mongolian Prime Minister Sukhbaatar Batbold to cooperate in
promoting rare earth mines in Mongolia, according to Kydo.
 In Canada, Great Western Minerals Group Ltd. on Wednesday
said it had ordered a new furnace needed to process more rare
earths, increasing capacity by 50 percent starting in the third
quarter of next year.
 More untapped supplies ready for plucking are known to
exist in Vietnam.
 Jonathan Barratt, managing director of Commodity Broking
Services in Sydney, said U.S. policy will determine whether the
bubble bursts in rare earths.
 The Pentagon is due to report on its plans for securing
rare earths to U.S. Congress this month.
 ""Is this a bubble? It depends on what the United States
decides to do,"" said Barratt.
 ""They have the metal in the ground and if they decide they
can cope with the environmental impact and start digging it up,
you will see prices adjust quite rapidly.""

1200,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 27, 2010 06:29AM ET</span>",Forex - AUD/USD tumbles to 1-week low after weak domestic data,
1201,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2010 06:28AM ET</span>","SCENARIOS-How the world can tackle skewed growth, FX"," SINGAPORE, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Finance leaders are trying to
reconcile their differences over deep imbalances in the global
economy and reduce the risk of a currency war.
 Last week's talks among Group of 20 finance ministers and
central bank chiefs in South Korea yielded some progress.
Leading emerging and developed economies pledged to refrain
from damaging competitive currency devaluations and to tackle
trade imbalances. They also agreed to give fast-growing nations
a bigger voice at the International Monetary Fund.
 Heads of G20 nations will meet at a Nov 11-12 summit to
discuss more detailed targets.
 Below are possible ways forward for addressing uneven
global growth and currency tensions, exemplified by China's big
current account surplus, a fragile dollar and ultra-loose
monetary policies in many rich economies.
 WILL THERE BE PROGRESS AT THE G20 SUMMIT IN SEOUL?
 PROBABILITY: Very high
 For all the finger-pointing and allegations over selfish
monetary policies preceding the gathering of finance ministers,
the outcome was surprisingly positive.
 It came nowhere close to meeting the expectations of some
market participants of a repeat of the landmark 1985 Plaza
Accord. Yet the group agreed broad guidelines to correct global
imbalances and lent the plan some credibility by asking the IMF
to police its implementation.
 Redistributing voting power at the IMF in favour of
emerging nations could lead to the likes of China and India, as
a quid pro quo, taking on greater responsibility for tackling
global issues.
 The overall deal thus provides ""deliverables"" for G20
leaders to endorse and trumpet when they meet in Seoul next
month.
 That said, the G20 statement was light on most matters.
 There was no explicit call for flexibility in China's yuan
or other managed currencies, no rebuke of central banks that
have intervened in the currency markets and enough ambiguity to
allow governments to pursue independent policy changes
gradually.
 It also glossed over a U.S. proposal to set numerical
targets for current account balances after deep opposition from
surplus countries such as Germany and Russia as well as from
India, which runs a deficit.
 But the two biggest players in the G20, the United States
and China, appear to be on board to set some guiding
principles, which means the Seoul summit may lay a foundation
for some coordination in redressing current account imbalances.
 WILL WE BE LEFT TO MUDDLE THROUGH?
 PROBABILITY: High
 G20 leaders may have signed a truce after months of trading
barbs on beggar-thy-neighbour money printing and currency
policies, but there is nothing to stop them from pursuing
national economic solutions.
 Indeed, South Africa said on Tuesday it would weaken the
rand to boost growth [ID:nLDE69P111]. And officials say South
Korea and Brazil might introduce fresh controls on capital
inflows before long.
 Likewise, a pledge at the G20 by advanced nations to be
""vigilant against excess volatility and disorderly movements in
exchange rates"" could soon be put to the test.
 The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to announce next week
another round of quantitative easing that pumps hundreds of
billions of dollars into the banking system [ID:nN25168493] --
despite the fears of Germany, Japan, China and others that the
result will be more dollar weakness.
 Last week's meeting showed there remains a veneer of the
remarkable unity displayed after the credit crisis exploded.
 Then, G20 leaders, determined to avert another Great
Depression, slashed interest rates, refloated money markets,
adopted a $1 trillion stimulus plan and pursued sweeping
financial sector reform.
 The group can only hope that financial markets do not test
their resolve anew by stirring up a fresh crisis.
 WILL THE IMF'S MAP PROCESS MAKE A DIFFERENCE?
 PROBABILITY: Low
 G20 finance ministers pledged to report regularly on
progress in adjusting current account imbalances as part of the
IMF's mutual assessment process (MAP).
 Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the IMF's managing director, also
proposed drawing up ""spill-over reports"" on how the policies of
the world's five largest economies -- the United States, China,
the euro zone, Japan and Britain -- affect each other.
 The reports would build on the annual reviews the IMF
already conducts of the policies of its 187 member countries.
 But the IMF has struggled for years to get governments to
heed its calls for structural reforms. As Strauss-Kahnn
acknowledged last week, the IMF lacks teeth: unless the fund is
lending money to a country, it cannot impose its policy
recommendations -- be it in relation to greater currency
flexibility in China or freer labour markets in Europe.
 Giving the IMF more power to police the global economy
would require an explicit extension of its mandate.
 There is no reason to assume that developing countries,
which are to get 6 percent more voting power at the fund, will
be any keener than rich nations have been to strengthen the
IMF's hand. Asian nations in particular still seethe at the
fund's handling of the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis.
 IS THE G20 NOW THE FORUM TO THRASH OUT CURRENCY
DIFFERENCES?
 PROBABILITY: Possibly
 The Group of 20, representing almost 90 percent of global
output, last year took over from the Group of Seven industrial
nations as the main forum for global economy policy-making.
 Critics say last week's communique is testament to how
unwieldy, disparate and ineffective the group is. But the very
fact that a consensus on currencies was forged is no mean feat.
 Some officials say the talks in Gyeongju were struggling
until G7 ministers struck a bargain over IMF representation at
a separate meeting with their counterparts from the BRICs --
Brazil, Russia, India and China.
 The currencies of the G7 -- the dollar, euro, yen, sterling
and Canadian dollar -- account for the vast bulk of the $3
trillion traded daily in the global foreign exchange market.
 But France, which assumes the G20 presidency after the
Seoul summit, has said there is no obvious alternative to the
G20.
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy wants a review of the
international monetary regime to be a centerpiece of his G20
presidency.
 DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW RESERVE CURRENCY
 PROBABILITY: Highly unlikely in the short term
 China and Russia favour moving the global economy away from
reliance on the dollar as the world's primary reserve currency.
 They have floated the idea of using a broader-based version
of the Special Drawing Right, the IMF's in-house unit of
account, which is currently composed of the dollar, euro, yen
and sterling.
 Momentum is growing behind the idea of adding the yuan to
the SDR basket, even though the Chinese currency is not
convertible on the capital account.
 But shifts in the status of reserve currencies do not
happen overnight. Even after the United States overtook Britain
in economic power, it was decades before the dollar supplanted
sterling as the world's principal reserve currency.
 Sarkozy wants to examine international monetary
arrangements, including the role of the SDR, during France's
G20 presidency.

 * WSJ says Fed may buy few hundred bln dollars of Treasuries
 * World stocks and commodities fall
 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Doubts over how aggressively the
U.S. Federal Reserve is going to stimulate a flagging recovery
with another round of money-printing weighed on world equities
and commodities on Wednesday while boosting the dollar.
Investors have been pricing in large scale U.S. Treasury
bond purchases by the Fed, lifting equities, commodities and
emerging market assets in recent weeks while the dollar has come
under pressure against other currencies.
 However, the Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday that the
Fed is likely to unveil next week an asset purchase programme
worth a few hundred billion dollars over several months, and
that officials wanted to avoid a ""shock and awe"" style approach.
 ""Underlying sentiment has clearly deteriorated ... the
market is moving away from the expectation of a huge initial
increase in QE to this rather incremental approach,"" said Nick
Stamenkovic, rate strategist at RIA Capital Markets in
Edinburgh.
A recent Reuters survey showed U.S. primary dealers expected
the size of the quantitative easing to be between $500 billion
and $1.5 trillion.
 The dollar was up 0.3 percent at 81.61 yen, pulling further
away from a 15-year low of 80.41 yen struck on trading platform
EBS earlier this week, and put on 0.1 percent against a basket
of currencies.
 The euro eased 0.2 percent to $1.3830.
 
 WORLD STOCKS, COMMODITIES PRESSURED
 The uncertainty over the size of quantitative easing
dampened equities and commodity prices.
 World stocks measured by MSCI All-Country World Index fell
0.4 percent and MSCI emerging market benchmark lost 1.1 percent,
while the Thomson Reuters global equity index eased 0.2 percent.
 U.S. stock index futures lost 0.2 to 0.3 percent, indicating
a weaker start for Wall Street.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 was flat, though the VDAX-NEW
volatility index rose 2 percent after hitting a near three-week
high, indicating investors' lower risk appetite. Tokyo's Nikkei
average added 0.1 percent, helped by a softer yen.
 Nick Tranter, head of derivatives at Execution Noble in
London, said people had become more cautious in recent days
after a strong run in the market, and he expected investors to
purchase more November and December put options this week to
hedge against a pull back in equities.
 ""The market is running very long risk, and isn't carrying
the kind of natural hedge that it carries normally, so people
will be looking to put on near-term protection strategies,"" he
said, adding that sentiment remained ""constructive"".
 Nevertheless, stock valuations remain cheap. The MSCI
All-Country World Index carries a 12-month forward earnings
ratio of 12.1 times, versus a 10-year average of 15.1, Thomson
Reuters Datastream showed.
 Gold fell 0.5 percent and copper dipped 0.1 percent, while
oil prices dropped 1 percent to trade below $82 a barrel.
 Yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose 5 basis
points to 2.6941 percent, while those on 10-year German Bunds
were up 0.7 basis points at 2.579 percent.

 LONDON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The dollar rose broadly on
Wednesday as speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve would take a
gradualist approach to more quantitative easing next week
prompted players to liquidate some short dollar positions.
 The dollar was pushed up to a two-week high against the yen
and a one-week peak versus the euro, which was also impacted by
euro zone banks taking up more cheap funding than expected at a
three-month ECB tender. The greenback also rose against the
Swiss franc and Australian dollar.
 The Wall Street Journal said the Fed would make bond
purchases worth a few hundred billion dollars over several
months, which compared with investors' base-case scenario for an
initial commitment to buy at least $500 billion. [ID:nTOE69Q02H]
 In a Reuters survey earlier this month, U.S. primary
dealers' projections for the size of the Fed's expected
quantitative easing at its next policy meeting on Nov. 2-3 had
ranged from $500 billion to $1.5 trillion. [FED/R]
 ""Expectations have been pared that the Fed ... would be more
aggressive,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, adding the euro could drop back to around
$1.35 in the next month or two.
 By 0935 GMT, the euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.3819 ,
after falling to a $1.3772 as a break though an option barrier
at $1.3800 accelerated selling.
 The single currency was also hurt as results of the European
Central Bank's first indexed three-month refinancing operation
showed a larger-than-expected take-up of 42 billion euros from
European banks for cheap funding. [ID:nLDE69Q0XN]
 But some said the dollar's rebound may be limited.
 ""There is not great downside potential (for the euro) as the
Fed is adopting a looser monetary policy while the direction of
the European Central Bank seems to be the opposite,"" said
Roberto Mialich, currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 Traders said there were likely to be bids for the euro at
around $1.3750/60. One major support may be at around $1.3787, a
76.4 percent retracement of its latest rebound from the low
around $1.37 to Monday's high.

 DOLLAR SUPPORTED
 The dollar was also supported by a rise in U.S. Treasury
yields, with the benchmark 10-year yield  rising to
one-month highs above 2.6 percent on Tuesday.
 The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the
greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up
0.1 percent at 77.79 <.DXY>.
 Adrian Schmidt, forex strategist at Lloyds TSB, said the
index was likely to rebound to 79.00 over the next two weeks, a
high last hit at the end of September.
 ""The rise is primarily positioning - everyone is short. But
to some extent it's also valuation - the dollar is cheap
particularly against the yen, the Swiss franc and the Aussie,""
he said.
 Against the yen, the dollar rose as high as 81.98 yen
, pulling further away from a 15-year low of 80.41 yen
struck earlier this week on trading platform EBS.
 But gains could be limited as ""there are quite a lot of
dollar-selling orders from Japanese exporters at the 82 yen
level,"" one Japanese trader said.
 Others said a fair amount of overnight 82.00 yen strikes
were bought on Tuesday, suggesting that area could be sticky
into Wednesday's 1400 GMT cut -- when many trades expire.
Option-related stops are then highlighted at 82.15 yen.
 The Australian dollar fell 1.2 percent to $0.9736 ,
after Australian consumer prices rose by less than expected last
quarter, reducing chances of an interest rate rise next week.
 The Norwegian central bank will hold a policy meeting on
Wednesday where markets expect no change in policy but will
focus on the central bank's rate path.

1205,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2010 05:56AM ET</span>",India's IT aims to soften image as Obama visits," By Tony Munroe and Peter Henderson
 MUMBAI/SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - U.S. President
Barack Obama's visit to India puts the spotlight on its $60
billion IT sector, which argues it is a creator of jobs in the
United States and should not be blamed for high unemployment.
 An increase in U.S. visa fees, a ban on offshoring by the
state of Ohio and the industry's portrayal in campaign ads as a
drain of U.S. jobs has set a frosty tone ahead of Obama's visit
to India in early November.
 Obama is expected to visit Mumbai, India's financial hub
and the centre of the 2008 militant attacks. U.S. officials say
much of the trip's focus will be boosting trade that is
expected to double in five years from the current level of $50
billion.
 But it is a sign of the times that Obama is not expected to
visit Bangalore, the country's technology hub. Nor is he
expected to visit Hyderabad, another Indian IT hotbed, where
his predecessor, George W. Bush, stopped in a 2006 visit.
 ""It is a worry, there's no question, but the worry is more
about unemployment, not about the political rhetoric,"" said
Pramod Bhasin, chief executive of outsourcer Genpact Ltd.
""We as an industry have to help create jobs in America and we
have to communicate that much better than we've done in the
past,"" said Bhasin, whose firm employs about 2,000 in the
United States and expects to double or triple that over the
next two to three years. Three-quarters of Genpact staff are in
India.
 Obama's fellow Democrats are expected to take a drubbing in
the Nov. 2 balloting amid unemployment stuck near 10 percent.
 In California, where the jobless rate tops 12 percent,
Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer accuses her Republican rival
Carly Fiorina of sending jobs abroad when she was chief of
Hewlett-Packard.
 Legislation that would end tax breaks for firms that create
jobs and profits overseas was thwarted in the Senate, but a new
rule raising the cost of certain visas to enter the United
States, part of a border security bill, will cost Indian IT
firms $200 million and sets an ominous precedent for the
industry.
 ""It has nothing to do with immigration, but it has had an
impact on the costs of IT services companies from India. That
is the kind of legislation that worries us,"" said S
Gopalakrishnan, CEO of sector bellwether Infosys Technologies
Ltd.
 SUCCESS VICTIM
 India's IT services industry, which generates 70 percent of
its revenue from the United States and accounts for 5 percent
of India's economy, is a victim of its own success.
 Before the global economic downturn, the sector was growing
by roughly one-third per year as companies across industries
shipped commoditised work to India and elsewhere to cut costs.
 U.S. blue chips from Intel and Google to Cisco and
Microsoft have substantial operations in India, which is
increasingly a research hub for Silicon Valley. IBM alone is
believed to employ more than 70,000 in India, although it would
not confirm that figure.
 While China's emergence as an industrial powerhouse has
spawned U.S. backlash over lost manufacturing jobs and a weak
currency that keeps exports cheap, India is associated with
armies of young engineers and service staff working for
one-fifth to one-third the wages of American white collar
workers.
 For India, the IT boom has created a world-leading industry
that has been culturally transformative in a tradition-rich
country, employing two million people working in modern offices
and buying cars and apartments.
 Outsourcers say they enable clients to innovate and
compete, providing skills not readily available in the United
States.
 ""There is a huge dearth of software engineers in the U.S.,
and a large part has been mitigated by offshore work,"" said
Aparup Sengupta, managing director and global chief executive
of Aegis Ltd, an IT services firm owned by the Essar
conglomerate.
 The perception within the United States is often less
benign.
 In an episode of ""Outsourced,"" a new U.S. comedy TV show,
bricks are thrown through the window of an American call center
that has transferred its work to India.
 JOB CREATION
 Indian IT industry players say they are not to blame for
U.S. job losses, and instead talk up creation of jobs both
directly and indirectly in the United States.
 ""Job losses are not due to outsourcing. They're due to
subprime, they're due to the financial mess, they're due to
lots of other things,"" said Bhasin of Genpact, which this year
bought an operation in Illinois from Walgreens as part of a
deal to provide accounting services for the drugstore chain.
 Outsourcing work to a lower-cost U.S. site can save roughly
20-25 percent, while moving work to India saves 70 to 80
percent.
 Last year, Infosys announced a plan to hire 1,000 employees
in the United States and said it has made nearly 300 job offers
since then. Of 122,000 Infosys staff, over 2,000 are
U.S.-based.
 ""We think there are perceptions and myths today, and these
need to be corrected, because it's not about jobs moving to
India, its about our creating jobs there,"" said Som Mittal,
president of Nasscom, the trade body for the Indian tech
sector.
 Anti-outsourcing talk may cool after next week's elections
but could reemerge with greater intensity in the run-up to
2012, when Obama will be up for re-election.
 ""In February, no one is going to be talking about India,""
said Derek Scissors, a research fellow in the Asian Studies
Center at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in
Washington. ""But what about 2012? That's a different story.""

 By David Fox
 HONG KONG, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose on
Wednesday on doubts that the Federal Reserve will aggressively
buy bonds to pump more money into the economy, triggering
profit taking in commodities and Asian equities.
 European stock markets followed Asia lower in early trade,
with the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of leading stocks
sliding 0.7 percent. S&P 500 futures  were down 0.7
percent, pointing to a weaker opening on Wall Street.
 The Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday that the Federal
Reserve would probably unveil a programme of U.S. Treasury bond
purchases worth ""a few hundred billion dollars"", but gave no
source for the report. [ID:nTOE69Q02H]
 Most currency dealers had expected a Fed policy meeting
next week to opt for more quantitative easing -- essentially
printing money to buy assets and pull market rates lower -- but
some believe the dollar already reflects those expectations and
the question of how much easing, and how fast, has kept them
edgy.
 The dollar index against a basket of major currencies
<.DXY>, rose 0.5 percent. The euro was down nearly half a
percent on the day at $1.3798 , while the dollar was up
0.41 percent at 81.73 yen .

 In a Reuters survey earlier this month, U.S. primary
dealers' projections for the size of the Fed's expected
quantitative easing had ranged from $500 billion to $1.5
trillion. [FED/R]
 ""The market has had in mind a figure of $1 trillion or more
and we had been in a situation where that had led to dollar
weakness,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist Japan
for Barclays Capital. [ID:nTOE69Q041]
 Analysts at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch wrote in a client
note that the prevailing market belief was that QE was now
close to being fully priced in and anything short of $500
billion in announced purchases over a six-month horizon could
disappoint and cause interest rates to rise.
 A top concern of policymakers in Asia is that any
additional easing by the Fed will send more speculative ""hot
money"" into emerging economies, pushing up their currencies to
the point where exports are less competitive and threatening
regional economic growth.
 Singapore's central bank warned on Wednesday of the risk of
a disorderly reverse of such capital inflows if inflation was
not contained. Indian and South Korean officials also expressed
concerns about the impact of the recent flood of inflows.

 By Saeed Azhar
 SINGAPORE, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Singapore's central bank
said on Wednesday that Asia was facing higher risks from a
surge of capital inflows, a tide that could reverse in a
disorderly fashion if inflationary pressures were not
contained.
 The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) issued the
warning in its latest macroeconomic review, echoing concerns
expressed by policymakers in many emerging economies over hot
money inflows that are pushing up regional currencies, stocks
and other assets such as property.
 The Bank of Korea's chief said on Wednesday that taxes on
foreign bond investors may be re-considered, while India's
central bank said managing exchange rates in the face of
volatile flows contained a cost. [nBMA008714] [nTOE69Q04V]
 Many emerging economies are concerned that the rush of
speculative inflows in recent months could create potentially
destabilising asset bubbles, making policymaking more
difficult.
 The surge of money into such economies, which is being
partially fueled by a weakening U.S. dollar, is also pushing up
many regional currencies, denting their export competitiveness
and threatening to stifle their economic recoveries.
 ""An upsurge in inflationary pressures that leads to a
disorderly reversal of flows could occur if regional economies
are not able to intermediate these flows efficiently,"" the MAS
said.
 For a list of recent measures taken by other government
around the world to control the impact of hot money inflows,
see [ID:nSGE69503F]
 The World Bank warned last week that capital flows posed a
rise to East Asian economies and said authorities needed to be
careful not to repeat the mistakes of the Asian financial
crisis more than a decade ago. [ID:nTOE69I02D]
 Analysts agreed.
 ""If you draw in large amounts of capital there is a risk
that hot money could flow out,"" said Leong Wai Ho at Barclays
Capital. ""But whether that warrants putting up walls to block
hot money coming in, the jury is still out on that.""
 He said in Singapore's case, the MAS' recent move to allow
exchange rate appreciation was relieving some of the pressure
from rising flows, while other macroeconomic and prudential
policies were tackling asset inflation.
 DBS bank said in a research report on Tuesday that Asia's
foreign exchange reserves have been growing at a rate of $2.3
billion a day since April 2009, faster than at any time in
history. [ID:nSGE69O054]
 David Carbon, head of economic and currency research at the
bank, said currency appreciation and capital controls would be
among the ways Asia could tackle these inflows.
 ""Will it all end in tears? That seems unlikely,"" Carbon
noted. ""If Asia's policymakers have any fault, it is that they
are too afraid of revisiting the 1990s.""
 SINGAPORE CLOSELY WATCHING MARKETS
 Singapore's central bank said banks, companies and
households are in a healthy position in Asia, but it was
closely monitoring credit and asset markets.
 MAS also said the risks of another round of financial
contagion arising from sovereign defaults and a
sharper-than-expected economic downturn in the developed
economies had ebbed somewhat.
 The MAS -- which tightened monetary policy further this
month by widening the trading band for the Singapore dollar --
said inflation in the city-state would remain high until the
first half of 2011 before moderating. For a story on monetary
policy click [ID:nSGE69B08J]
 Singapore's economy will hit a slow patch in the immediate
quarters ahead due to a fragile global economy before
recovering in 2011 on strong Asian growth prospects, as well as
continued expansion in financial services and tourism, the MAS
said.
 Despite the impending slowdown, the economy will grow at by
13 percent to 15 percent in 2010, the fastest annual growth
ever, and would expand at a more sustainable pace in 2011, it
said.
 The services sector could account for two-third of gross
domestic product in 2011, up from 50 percent this year, fueled

 WARSAW, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Hefty provisions for court claims
dragged Poland's top telecoms operator TPSA to its first
quarterly loss, with the group stressing it should remain in the
black for all of 2010.
 The France Telecom unit posted a third-quarter net loss of
720 million zlotys ($256 million), double what the market
expected, hit by 1.1 billion zlotys in new provisions for claims
from GN Store Nord's unit DPTG.
 Last month DPTG won a 2.9 billion Danish crown ($525
million) court claim against TPSA, adding it would seek a
further 1 billion crowns in a lengthy dispute over traffic
volumes via a fibre-optic network in Poland.
 Shares in TPSA declined as much as 2.5 percent, weighing on
Warsaw's blue-chip WIG20 index, before paring losses to trade
down 1.2 percent by 0755 GMT.
 ""Booking such reserves in the third quarter does not mean we
are altering our dividend policy or our mid-term goals,"" Chief
Executive Maciej Witucki told reporters in a conference call.
 ""These reserves relate both to the first phase of the court
dispute and our extrapolation of the second phase. It should
absolutely not be treated as our opinion on the matter or the
final results of the dispute.""
 TPSA did not meet a deadline to pay the first fine, calling
the amount disproportionate and adding it would use all legal
means to lower it.
 ""Reserves are indeed surprising, as TPSA booked more than
one could expect,"" said Pawel Puchalski, an analyst at BZ WBK.
""It's hard to say if this seals it as far as the DPTG row is
concerned. It will depend on how much DPTG claims for the second
phase.""
 Stripped of the new provisions, TPSA net profit rose almost
14 percent to 372 million zlotys, while analysts who gave
adjusted estimates had expected 339 million. Free cash flow
after the quarter stood at around 2 billion zlotys.
 Sales fell a touch faster than expected 3.9 percent to 3.9
billion in the quarter, with Witucki expecting the downward
trend to wane.
 ""Fourth-quarter (pace of revenue decline) should be slightly
better than the third quarter,"" he said. ""I maintain that the
full-year decline for the top line should be less than 6
percent, with the second-half pace lower than 4 percent.""

 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher against the
yen and euro on Wednesday after the Wall Street Journal said the
Federal Reserve was likely to unveil plans for gradual Treasury
purchases at its policy meeting next week.
 The newspaper said the Fed is likely to reveal a programme of
U.S. Treasury bond purchases worth several hundred billion
dollars over several months.
 What the report called a ""measured approach"" compares with
investors' base-case scenario for an initial commitment to buy at
least $500 billion in Treasury debt.
 In a Reuters survey earlier this month, U.S. primary dealers'
projections for the size of the Fed's expected quantitative
easing had ranged from $500 billion to $1.5 trillion.
 ""The market has had in mind a figure of $1 trillion or more
and we had been in a situation where that had led to dollar
weakness,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist Japan for
Barclays Capital.
 ""Compared to that, the initial size may seem small,"" he said,
adding that the report could prompt some market players to cover
short dollar positions.
 The Wall Street Journal said the Fed could leave open the
possibility of more purchases in the future. Or it could halt the
programme if the economy or inflation took off surprisingly, the
newspaper said.
 The euro dipped 0.3 percent to $1.3820, having slipped as low
as $1.3802 earlier.
 An option barrier for the euro lies at $1.3800, a break of
which could open way for a test of its recent low near $1.3700,
said a trader for a Japanese brokerage house.
 Traders may be cautious about chasing the euro lower,
however, given that it rebounded sharply last week after hitting
that trough near $1.3700, the trader said.
 One major support may be at around $1.3787, a 76.4 percent
retracement of its latest rebound from the low around $1.37 to
Monday's high.
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 81.63 yen, pulling further
away from a 15-year low of 80.41 yen struck on trading platform
EBS earlier this week.
 The dollar has risen above its five-day moving average for
the first time in about a month, giving dollar bulls some hopes
for a further rebound.
 But it is seen likely to meet formidable resistance at around
82 yen in view of selling interest by Japanese exporters.
 ""The consensus has been for roughly $500 billion after the
November FOMC meeting so the fact that the Wall Street Journal
story seems to say a few hundred billion, it seems to be a little
less than what would be considered consensus,"" said Sue Trinh, a
senior FX strategist at RBC Hong Kong.
 ""There's been a bit of a scramble to cover dollar shorts as
the market has reassessed what it might mean relative to
consensus,"" Trinh said.
 Growing expectations the Fed may proceed more cautiously than
previously thought if it launches a new round of monetary easing
at next week's policy meeting had given the dollar a boost on
Tuesday.
 Partly reflecting that caution, U.S. Treasury yields climbed,
with the benchmark 10-year yield rising to one-month highs above
2.6 percent on Tuesday. Traders said that rise in Treasury yields
was helping to lend the greenback support.
 ""As you can tell from the rise in U.S. bond yields, basically
the markets have fully priced in the chance that the Fed will
start quantitative easing. We'll probably have to wait for the
details for the next direction of the market,"" said a trader at a
Japanese brokerage house.
 The Australian dollar slid 1.2 percent to $0.9743, coming
under pressure after data showing Australian consumer prices
climbed by less than expected last quarter while the annual pace
of core inflation was the slowest in five years, greatly
lessening the urgency for a hike in interest rates next week.
 Immediate support is seen around $0.9660, its low last week.
 Market players have been bracing for a possible
short-covering bounce in the dollar against other currencies,
given a recent buildup in bets that the dollar would fall.
 Latest U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data shows
currency speculators still have hefty short positions in the
dollar, even after having trimmed such bets recently.
 The value of the dollar's net short position fell to $25.8
billion in the week ended Oct. 19. Net short dollar positions
totalled about $30 billion two weeks ago, the biggest bet against
the greenback since at least June 2008.

 STOCKHOLM, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Nordea, the biggest Nordic
bank by market value, benefited from a strengthening regional
economy and falling loan losses to beat forecasts with an
unexpected rise in third-quarter operating profit.
 The bank's shares hit their highest level in nearly a year
after the results, and were up 3.5 percent at 73.35 crowns at
1007 GMT, while the European banking index was up about 0.5
percent.
 Nordea Bank AB and its Nordic rivals have outperformed banks
elsewhere in Europe this year, thanks to strong capital levels
and the fact that loan losses in previously troubled markets
such as the Baltic states have eased.
 But Nordea did not adjust its full-year expectations for a
fall in risk-adjusted profit because of reduced treasury and
markets revenue.
 Buoyed by rising interest rates in Sweden, Nordea posted
record income, having now more than made up for slippage during
the global financial crisis. As loan losses shrank,
risk-adjusted profit came back to year-ago levels.
 Operating profit for the period rose 15 percent to 960
million euros ($1.34 billion), while analysts had been expecting
a 10 percent fall to 749 million in a Reuters poll.
 ""They are strong across the entire board, with beats on net
interest income, net commission income and on the trading line,""
said Morgan Stanley analyst Henrik Schmidt.
 ""And you see loan losses coming down, so it is a good
result. If you look at volume growth, they are growing very fast
there as well.""
 The bank said conditions were improving.
 ""The macroeconomic recovery is particularly strong in the
Nordic area, where we see these solid growth rates right now,""
Chief Executive Christian Clausen told a news conference.
 ""We have modest inflation, relatively strong public finances
and improvements in the labour markets. Compared to the rest of
Europe, the Nordic area is actually performing very well.""
 Net interest income, under pressure due to low official
rates, reached 1.31 billion euros in the period. That topped a
1.27 billion forecast, while trading income of 446 million euros
was 30 percent better than expected.
 
 BASEL III
 The bank said higher-than-average funding costs continued to
eat into margins, a factor that has plagued most of the region's
lenders as investors demand a bigger financial cushion. It also
said the uncertain regulatory environment made it difficult to
forecast future capital costs.
 Nordea's core tier 1 capital ratio of 10.4 percent was up
from 10 percent in the second quarter but at the lower end of
peers, which have seen a run-up in their share prices as
investors bank on potential buybacks and higher dividends.
 Nordea's chief financial officer said the bank anticipated
that under Basel III rules, its Core Tier 1 ratio would be 100
basis points lower.
 Nordea's shares are up 8 percent since the start of the
year, while the European banking index has fallen 7 percent.
 However, rivals such as SEB and Swedbank have seen gains of
17 percent and 35 percent, respectively, as their Baltic
exposures have become less costly.
 Nordea, which also has business in Latvia, Lithuania and
Estonia, but on a smaller scale, repeated that net loan losses
in 2010 would be lower than in 2009.
 Swedbank and Handelsbanken have already reported
forecast-beating results. SEB and Norway's DnB NOR will release
results on Thursday.

 By Robert-Jan Bartunek
 BRUSSELS, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Belgian wireless Internet
device maker Option and arch-rival Huawei Technologies announced
a surprise agreement on Wednesday to cooperate on research and
development and share technology.
 The two companies, locked in a dispute over alleged Chinese
subsidies and dumping, said they would work on joint research
and development projects in telecoms and were looking at
establishing a joint R&D centre in Belgium.
 Option said the deal would allow it to focus on software,
embedded modules and security modules and place less emphasis on
the sale of USB sticks, an increasingly commoditised business.
 ""We keep our independence, that's important,"" Chief
Executive Officer Jan Callewaert told Reuters in an interview.
 Chief Financial Officer John Ziegler said Option had not yet
decided on the future of its commoditised USB business, which
was the subject of a dispute over alleged Chinese subsidies and
dumping.
 ""We will see how the market plays out,"" he added.
 Ziegler said the deal would not prevent the two companies
from competing with each other.
 KBC Securities, which upgraded the stock to ""hold"" from
""sell"", said the deal solved Option's liquidity problems,
providing it with more time and money to develop further a new
strategy focusing on more value-added products.
 Shares in Option leapt to eight-month highs, having fallen
from a peak of over 16 euros in 2006 to less than 1 euro. They
were up 44 percent at 0.72 euros at 1100 GMT.
 Option said it had withdrawn all anti-dumping and
anti-subsidy complaints against imports of wireless wide area
networking modems from China.
 It and Huawei will work on joint research and development
projects in telecoms and are also looking at establishing a
joint R&D centre in Belgium.
 Huawei agreed to license Option's connection manager
software, for which the first year of the license is valued at
27 million euros ($37.68 million), which could be extended to 18
months for up to 33 million euros.
 China's Huawei would acquire Option's semiconductor company
M4S, making chips for next-generation telephony, for about 8
million euros.
 The company asked the Belgian government to withdraw its
so-called safeguard request, and asked the European Commission
to close all three investigations.
Option, Europe's only maker of cards, USB sticks and
embedded modems for surfing the net on laptops, has repeatedly
blamed ""unfair"" trade practices of Chinese competitors for a
string of losses stretching back to the second quarter of 2008.
 ZTE is its other main rival.

money manager, is unconvinced of the long-term investment
potential for the non-China rare earths sector despite signs
that Chinese exports are drying up.
 Some prices for rare earths, used in everything from TV
flatscreens and computers to mobile phones and defence
equipment, have hit record highs because of Chinese curbs on
exports, amid concerns that Beijing is using the commodity as a
trade weapon.
 ""The ability to bring on production quickly in the
higher-price environment means that the longer-term
sustainability of those prices are questionable,"" Catherine
Raw, a fund manager in BlackRock's natural-resources division,
said on Wednesday.
 China, which produces 97 percent of the world's rare
earths, halted shipments to Japan after a territorial dispute
with Tokyo flared up last month. Its move has sparked a flurry
of activity among miners from Australia to North America to
Kazakhstan.
 ""We are trying to invest on a three to five-year view, and
longer, to identify where you can see long-term structural
increases in commodities,"" Raw told Reuters.
 ""The jury on rare earths is still out.""
 China in July announced it would cut export quotas for rare
earth minerals by 72 percent for the second half of 2010,
continuing a drop in exports since 2008. It said it needed to
divert more production to domestic consumption.

 * Dollar seen supported by short-covering
 * WSJ: Fed eyes gradual bond buys of several hundred bln dlrs
 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher against the
yen and euro on Wednesday after the Wall Street Journal said the
U.S. Federal Reserve was likely to unveil plans for gradual
Treasury purchases at its policy meeting next week.
 The newspaper said the Fed is likely to reveal a programme of
U.S. Treasury bond purchases worth a few hundred billion dollars
over several months.
 What the Journal report called a ""measured approach"" compares
with investors' base-case scenario of an initial commitment to
buy at least $500 billion in Treasury debt.
 In a recent Reuters survey earlier this month, U.S. primary
dealers' projections for the size of the Fed's expected
quantitative easing had ranged from $500 billion to $1.5
trillion.
 ""The market has had in mind a figure of $1 trillion or more
and we had been in a situation where that had led to dollar
weakness,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist Japan for
Barclays Capital.
 ""Compared to that, the initial size may seem small,"" he said,
adding that the report could prompt some market players to cover
their short dollar positions.
 The Wall Street Journal said the Fed could leave open the
possibility of more purchases in the future. Or it could halt the
programme if the economy or inflation took off surprisingly, the
newspaper said.
 The euro dipped 0.2 percent to $1.3834, having slipped to as
low as $1.3815 earlier.
 The euro has an option barrier at $1.3800, a break of which
could open way for a test of its recent low near $1.3700, said a
trader for a Japanese brokerage house.
 Traders, however, may be cautious about chasing the euro
lower after it rebounded sharply last week after hitting that
trough near $1.3700, the trader said.
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 81.63 yen, pulling further
away from a 15-year low of 80.41 yen struck on trading platform
EBS earlier this week.
 ""The consensus has been for roughly $500 billion after the
November FOMC meeting so the fact that the Wall Street Journal
story seems to say a few hundred billion, it seems to be a little
less than what would be considered consensus,"" said Sue Trinh,
senior FX strategist at RBC Hong Kong.
 ""There's been a bit of a scramble to cover dollar shorts as
the market has reassessed what it might mean relative to
consensus,"" Trinh said.
 Growing expectations the Federal Reserve may proceed more
cautiously than previously thought, if it launches a new round of
monetary easing at next week's policy meeting, had given the
dollar a boost on Tuesday.
 Partly reflecting that caution, U.S. Treasury yields climbed,
with the benchmark 10-year yield rising to one-month highs above
2.6 percent on Tuesday. Traders said that rise in Treasury yields
was helping to lend the greenback support.
 The Australian dollar slid 1 percent to $0.9760, coming under
pressure after data showed Australian consumer prices climbed by
less than expected last quarter while the annual pace of core
inflation was the slowest in five years, greatly lessening the
urgency for a hike in interest rates next week.
 Market players have been bracing for a possible
short-covering bounce in the dollar against other currencies,
given a recent build-up in bets that the dollar would fall.
 Latest U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data shows
currency speculators still have hefty short positions in the
dollar, even after having trimmed such bets recently.
 The value of the dollar's net short position fell to $25.8
billion in the week ended Oct. 19. Net short dollar positions
totalled about $30 billion two weeks ago, the biggest bet against
the greenback since at least June 2008.

 HONG KONG, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar edged up on
Wednesday on doubts the Federal Reserve will aggressively buy
assets to pump more money into the system, while commodity
stocks led Asian stocks lower.
 Most currency dealers expect the Fed to opt for more
quantitative easing at a policy meeting next week-- essentially
printing money to buy assets and pull market rates lower -- but
some believe the weakening dollar already reflects those
expectations, and the question of how much easing, and how
fast, has kept investors edgy.

 The Fed meets on Nov. 2-3, but some investors have begun to
reconsider the likelihood of a big burst of QE after comments
from various members of the central bank.
 The U.S. currency rose broadly on Tuesday as investors
speculated the Federal Reserve would proceed more cautiously in
announcing any asset-buying, scaling back bets against the
greenback.
 ""I think it's still possible that QE II is not a done deal
for November, even though the market has been trading as if it

 AUSSIE CPI SURPRISE
 New data from Australia showed consumer prices there rose
by less than expected in the last quarter while the annual pace
of core inflation was the slowest in five years -- greatly
lessening the urgency for a hike in interest rates next week.
 The key trimmed mean measure of underlying inflation
favoured by analysts rose 0.6 percent in the quarter and 2.5
percent for the year, seemingly justifying the RBA's decision
to skip a rise in its 4.5 percent cash rate this month and give
it room to pause ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting.
 The market now implies around a 29 percent chance of a hike
next week  -- down from 60 percent earlier in the
day -- and just 37 basis points of tightening over the next 12
months compared to 57 basis points before the data.
 ASIAN STOCKS FLAT TO LOWER
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan slipped
0.46 percent <.MIAPJ0000PUS> while the MSCI's emerging market
stock benchmark <.MSCIEF> was down 0.23 percent at 0130.
 The rebounding dollar has caused some investors to bail
from commodity stocks, pulling down the MSCI Asia ex-Japan
commodity sector index 1.2 percent on the day.
 U.S. stocks ended little changed before the potential
market tumult of next week's U.S. elections and likely
announcement of more stimulus from the Fed.
 Next week's high-profile events could signal shifts in both
monetary policy and legislative direction, raising fears that

 TOKYO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve is likely
next week to unveil a programme of U.S. Treasury bond purchases
worth a few hundred billion dollars over several months, the Wall
Street Journal reported on Wednesday.
 What the Journal report called a ""measured approach"" compares
with investors' base-case scenario of an initial commitment to
buy at least $500 billion in Treasury debt over five months, in
an effort to spur lending and to support an economic recovery
that is too weak to tame high unemployment.
 The Journal gave no source for the report on its website and
said that, although details remain to be sorted out internally,
the broad outlines have taken shape.
 Fed officials meet on Nov. 2-3 and are widely expected to
embark on a second round of monetary easing, but much uncertainty
surrounds the scope and pace of possible bond purchases.
 The Journal said Fed officials wanted to avoid the ""shock and
awe"" style used during the global financial crisis in favour of
an approach that allowed them to adjust their policy, and
possibly add to their purchases, over time as the recovery
unfolded.
 It said the Fed could leave open the possibility of more
purchases in the future, particularly if inflation is projected
to remain below 2 percent and the unemployment outlook remains
high, or it could halt the programme if the economy or inflation
took off surprisingly.
 The bond-buying programme is likely to focus on Treasury
bonds with maturities mostly between two years and 10 years, it
said.
 The Fed could buy even longer-term bonds, although some
officials are reluctant to do that aggressively because it could
expose them to long-term losses without much added benefit, it
said.

 NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The dollar rose broadly on
Tuesday as investors speculated the Federal Reserve would

week, scaling back bets against the greenback.
 Stocks, meanwhile, ended flat to lower on earnings and
ahead of next week's U.S. elections and the Fed meeting to

 U.S. government debt prices fell ahead of more new debt
supply. But traders said a big retreat was unlikely because of
the Fed meeting - at which the U.S. central bank is expected to
say it will buy bonds via quantitative easing to revive growth
and avert deflation.
 Most currency traders expect the Fed to opt for more
quantitative easing, but some easing is priced into an already
weak dollar. The questions of how much easing the Fed's Open
Market Committee does and how fast have kept investors edgy
about building more bearish bets on the dollar.
 Japanese stocks were poised to open higher, with the

 QE essentially involves printing more money, so a flood of

 NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Tuesday
after the euro again lost momentum near $1.40, while the yen
fell from a 15-year peak after a Japanese minister called gains
one-sided and warned that authorities could act to stem further

 Although both the euro and yen were within recent well-worn

a creeping sense that the Federal Reserve may proceed more
cautiously than previously thought if it launches a new round

 Few doubt the Fed's intention to announce plans to buy more
U.S. government bonds, a process that would push down U.S.
interest rates and undermine the dollar's appeal to investors.
 But some said traders were getting cautious as the Nov. 2-3
policy meeting draws closer and after the 10-year Treasury
yield snapped out of a downtrend and rose above 2.60 percent.
 ""The big question is what happens once we get past the Fed
event,"" said BNP Paribas strategist Sebastien Galy. ""If you're

 Markets have priced in about $500 billion of Fed bond
purchases over six months.
 ""It's all based on reality versus expectations,"" said Jack
Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. ""If the
Fed announces easing in excess of, say, $800 billion, that
would help push the dollar down,"" he said, while the dollar
""could see a sharp rebound if investors are disappointed.""
 CAUTION WEAKENS EURO
 The euro fell 0.8 percent to $1.3848 , breaking
through support at $1.3866, its 21-day simple moving average.
It failed to close above $1.40 on Monday.
 Demand for ""out-of-the-money"" puts on the S&P 500 index and
dollar calls against the euro have risen, traders said.
 With U.S. interest rates already near zero, another round
of asset purchases would be ""one of the last bullets the Fed
has in its gun, and it's gong to be very reluctant to fire it
unless circumstances are really dire,"" said Brian Dolan, chief
currency strategist at Forex.com.
 The Fed bought $1.7 trillion in mortgage-backed and
government bonds during a first round of quantitative easing.
 Galy said the trend may continue beyond the Fed meeting as
well, as investors look to lock in profits ahead of year end.
 On the euro, CitiFX strategists said they had closed long
euro bets against the dollar, sterling and Swiss franc.
 Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange, said the euro could fall as low as $1.3750 in the
short term and said it would probably struggle to rise back
above $1.40 for fundamental as well as technical reasons.
 ""Even after the Fed meeting, we think the euro's hit a top
against the dollar, and protests in France are reminding people
of the problems European governments there are going to have as
they implement austerity packages,"" he said.
 STERLING UP, TRADERS EYEING YEN
 A report showing U.S. consumer confidence rose slightly in
October helped the dollar on the margins, but it was sterling
that got the biggest boost from economic data, rising 0.7

 Demand for ""out-of-the-money"" puts on the S&P 500 index and
dollar calls against the euro have risen, traders said.
 With U.S. interest rates already near zero, another round
of asset purchases would be ""one of the last bullets the Fed
has in its gun, and it's gong to be very reluctant to fire it
unless circumstances are really dire,"" said Brian Dolan, chief
currency strategist at Forex.com.
 The Fed bought $1.7 trillion in mortgage-backed and
government bonds during a first round of quantitative easing.
 Galy said the trend may continue beyond the Fed meeting as
well, as investors look to lock in profits ahead of year end.
 On the euro, CitiFX strategists said they had closed long
euro bets against the dollar, sterling and Swiss franc.
 Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange, said the euro could fall as low as $1.3750 in the
short term and said it would probably struggle to rise back
above $1.40 for fundamental as well as technical reasons.
 ""Even after the Fed meeting, we think the euro's hit a top
against the dollar, and protests in France are reminding people
of the problems European governments there are going to have as
they implement austerity packages,"" he said.
 STERLING UP, YEN INTERVENTION IN FOCUS
 A report showing U.S. consumer confidence rose slightly in
October helped the dollar on the margins, but it was sterling
that got the biggest boost from economic data, rising 0.6
percent to $1.5825  after a report showed the UK
economy grew more rapidly than thought in the second quarter.
 The dollar was up 0.9 percent at 81.58 yen  after
Japan's finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned the government
would ""act decisively"" in markets if needed. [ID:nTOE69O09F]
 Japan intervened to sell the yen in September for the first
time since 2004, and markets fear a second round of yen selling
if the currency nears 80 per dollar. Traders said Japanese life
insurers and banks were among the yen sellers on Tuesday.

 Those talks had moved debate from the ""surface issue"" of

rebalancing world trade,"" he told the FT.
 ""I was very encouraged by the G20 meeting,"" Li was quoted

 Last week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner called
on G20 countries to commit to specific targets for reducing
current account imbalances. The proposal, laid out in a letter

(Updates with Europe's market close)
 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The dollar rose broadly on
Tuesday as investors reassessed the extent of likely Federal
Reserve asset-buying and scaled back bets against the
greenback, while stocks slipped on financial results.
 U.S. government debt prices fell before a two-year Treasury
note auction. But traders said a big retreat was unlikely
because the Fed meeting - at which the U.S. central bank is
expected to say it will buy assets to try to revive growth and
avert deflation - is only one week away.
 Most currency traders expect the Fed to opt for more
quantitative easing next week, but some easing is priced into
an already weak dollar. The questions of how much easing the
Fed's Open Market Committee does and how fast have kept
investors edgy about building more bearish bets on the dollar.
 QE essentially involves printing more money, so a flood of
dollars on the market would debase the currency's value.
 ""Everything is dependent on the FOMC and people don't want
to take aggressive positions ahead of this very big decision,""
said Stephan Maier, currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 The Fed meets next on Nov. 2-3.
 But some investors have begun to reconsider the likelihood
of a big burst of QE after comments from Fed officials late on
Monday.
 Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenig called more asset
purchases by the central bank a ""very dangerous gamble."" New
York Fed President William Dudley said the U.S. economic
context would determine whether an incremental or sizable
approach to asset purchases was better.
 ""I think it's still possible that QE II is not a done deal
for November, even though the market has been trading as if it
is,"" said Brian Dolan, chief currency strategist at Forex.com

1237,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2010 01:04PM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-BoE's Posen-Loose monetary policy not cause of bubbles," * Strong currencies, not weak ones, bring bubble risk
 * ""Right and reasonable"" for surplus countries to act on FX
 * Loose monetary policy does not cause asset bubbles

(Adds detail, changes dateline to BELFAST)
 BELFAST, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Loose monetary policy does not
cause asset price bubbles, and fear that it does is a poor
reason for economies in East Asia to keep their currencies
undervalued, Bank of England policymaker Adam Posen said on
Tuesday.
 Posen did not address British monetary policy in the speech
at Queen's University in Belfast, according to the text
published by the Bank of England, and instead focused on how to
tackle global imbalances in trade and capital flows.
 ""That adjustment has been the source of rather contentious
political jousting across the Pacific and around the globe of
late,"" he said. 
 ""I will try to offer tonight some analytical insights into
why it is right and reasonable for the major surplus countries
to undertake more adjustment than they have so far,"" he
continued.
 The United States and China were at loggerheads at a recent
meeting of G20 developed and emerging economies in South Korea,
with China resisting calls to let its currency appreciate and
thus reduce its trade surplus with America.
 Posen said that it was in the self-interest of countries
with trade surpluses to seek to reduce them, and that these
countries' central banks had a role to play here.
 He blamed some East Asian commentators' opposition on an
incorrect interpretation of Japanese monetary policy in the late
1980s.
 Under this interpretation, Japan's real estate bubble and
subsequent slump was caused by the country bowing to U.S.
pressure and keeping monetary policy too loose, in a bid to
weaken the yen versus the dollar.
 Posen argued that this view was wrong, and that the bubble
was largely caused by poor financial regulation, which led to
Japanese banks lending too much to small and medium-sized
businesses, especially in the construction sector.
 ""Japan's bubbles of the 1980s and their bursting took place
due to non-monetary domestic factors,"" he said.
 ""No one in East Asia or elsewhere can credibly claim that
fear of feeding an asset price bubble is justification for
keeping an exchange rate undervalued,"" Posen said in the speech.
 Instead, for open economies there was the opposite risk.
Overvalued currencies risked attracting excessive foreign
capital inflows that would push up domestic asset prices above
fair value.
 ""I think central bankers in emerging markets are too smart
to fall for such monetary snake oil, no matter how slick the
salesmen,"" Posen said.
 ""If not, we will soon have a demonstration of how raising
interest rates in an open economy will fuel bubbles further by
attracting more capital inflows, rather than popping bubbles.""

 * Says exporters are prepared for exchange rate changes
 * Says export growth next year to be stable, imports to soar
 
 BEIJING, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Dollar issuance by the United
States is ""out of control"", leading to an inflation assault on
China, the Chinese commerce minister said in comments reported
on Tuesday.
 Chen Deming, speaking at a trade fair in southern China,
said that exporters had done a good job of preparing themselves
for exchange rate changes as well as rising labour costs, but
were suddenly confronted with new challenges.
 ""Because the United States' issuance of dollars is out of
control and international commodity prices are continuing to
rise, China is being attacked by imported inflation. The
uncertainties of this are causing firms big problems,"" Chen was
quoted as saying by the official Xinhua news agency.
 Chinese officials have criticised U.S. monetary policy as
being too loose before, but rarely in such explicit language.
 At the G20 meeting in South Korea which ended on Saturday,
Chinese Finance Minister Xie Xuren said that issuers of major
reserve currencies -- code for the United States -- must follow
responsible economic policies.
 Along with posing an inflationary risk, a weak dollar also
places appreciation pressure on China's yuan since its value is
so closely tied to the U.S. currency.
 China's consumer price inflation rose to 3.6 percent in the
year to September, a 23-month high. It has been led mainly by
food costs and many economists expect it to crest before the end
of the year.
 Despite his concern about the impact of U.S. monetary
policy, Chen gave a positive outlook for Chinese trade next
year. He said export growth would be stable, while imports would
increase strongly.

 * Future of Japan's manufacturing sector seen at stake
 * Toyota to revise exchange rate assumptions - president
 
 (Adds quotes and background)
 TOKYO, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp President Akio
Toyoda said on Tuesday prolonged strength in the yen was a big
problem and could threaten the competitiveness of Japanese
manufacturing.
 Like many Japanese automakers, Toyota has set its dollar
rate assumption at 90 yen -- about 10 yen weaker than current
rates -- implying a 150 billion yen ($1.85 billion) currency
loss in the October-March half if it assumed 80 yen instead.
 Asked in an interview on Japanese TV whether Toyota intended
to revise its currency assumption, Toyoda said: ""Obviously there
is a big discrepancy against current exchange rates, so we will
revise the assumption at the appropriate time."" 
 Asked if the revision would be to somewhere between 80 and
89 yen, he said, ""That's probably fair."" Toyota, the world's
biggest automaker, is scheduled to announce its July-September
second quarter results on Nov. 5.
 Japanese automakers are scrambling to cut costs and sell
more cars to offset the damage from a stronger currency.
 But Toyota is in a tougher spot than rivals Nissan Motor Co
and Honda Motor Co because it builds a relatively high 40-45
percent of its vehicles in Japan, exporting about half of that.
 Toyoda, grandson of the automaker's founder, said he was
more worried about the future of Japanese manufacturing than the
short-term impact on Toyota's bottom line.
 ""Rather than the impact on our profits, the fact that this
kind of (dollar-yen) level has lasted this long is a major
crisis for Japanese 'monozukuri',"" he said, referring to Japan's
culture of manufacturing that has been responsible for the
success of the country's auto industry.
 ""Toyota has grown strong and evolved by making cars for
Japanese customers, who are some of the toughest customers in
the world. That's how we have expanded in the world.
 ""If this (foreign exchange) level continues, it is a big
problem. It could threaten the very foundation (of monozukuri),""
he said.
 That echoed comments made earlier in the day by Nissan Chief
Operating Officer Toshiyuki Shiga, who also heads Japan's auto
industry lobby.
 Japan's finance minister also warned on Tuesday the
government would ""act decisively"" in markets if needed and
expressed Tokyo's irritation with the yen's climb to another
15-year high.
 Toyoda noted that Toyota builds about 3 million vehicles in
Japan -- out of about 7 million units last year -- and that his
company would have to find a way to protect that level of
domestic production.
 ""For Toyota to be Toyota, we want to maintain a certain
level of R&D and production in Japan. But the current reality is
that conditions are very much working against us. I feel a huge
sense of crisis about this.""

 NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose as the
euro again failed to hold above the $1.4000 level in the prior
session leaving investors wary of betting against the greenback
on Tuesday.
 The Swedish crown and sterling were also actively traded
after the Swedish central bank, which raised interest rates as
expected, said future rate increases would be more gradual than
expected, [ID:nLDE69P0NR] while the British economy grew more
than expected.
 Overall however, uncertainty over the extent of
quantitative easing measures the Federal Reserve may take next
week kept foreign exchange trading in predictable ranges.
 Euro/dollar ""has struggled to break sustainably above
$1.40,"" said Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at
Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 ""We still expect this will be the next move, however if it
is unable to do so soon, we might see some temporary weakness
before markets have enough conviction to push it above this
level,"" she said.
 Midway through the New York session, the euro fell 0.7
percent to $1.3860  after failing to close above $1.4000
on Monday. The euro has support at 1.3860, its low on Friday,
and its 21-day simple moving average at $1.3866.
 The euro fell to a session low after a report showed U.S.
consumer confidence rose slightly in October but then recovered
though it was still down on the day. [ID:nN26128177].
The move back below $1.4000 was viewed as significant given
the euro had failed several times in recent days to break
through and hold that level.
 ""I haven't heard that $1.40 is any more significant than
any other number,"" said Tom Levinson, FX strategist at ING in
London. ""From the fundamental perspective the market mayu want
to wait for the Fed and until third quarter GDP numbers are
out.""
 The market expects the Fed to opt for more quantitative
easing at its policy meeting next week, but some easing is seen
priced into an already weak dollar. How much easing the Fed
decides on and how gradually it will implement is uncertain,
keeping investors edgy about building more bearish bets on the
dollar.
 The advance release of U.S. third quarter gross domestic
product data is on Friday.
 Should the euro break through $1.4000, resistance comes at
$1.4442 which is the 78.6 percent retracement of the move from
the $1.5141 high in November 2009 to the $1.1876 low in June
2010 said Dean Malone said Dean Malone, a currency director at
Compass FX in Dallas, Texas.
 Large option barriers, including a one-touch option

 ""Japan has pointed out quite clearly that they will
intervene in dollar/yen if it falls too quickly and the market
is aware there is no easy one-way bet on dollar/yen downside,""

 * Global ""currency war"" to leave permanent scars
 * Offshore NDF trading boosted by intervention measures
 By Samantha Pearson
 SAO PAULO, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Brazil's battle to slow a
recent rally in its currency is jeopardizing plans to open the
real to international trading.
 With a view to one day becoming a major financial hub with
as much clout as Hong Kong or New York, Brazil has been working
to transform the real into a so-called convertible currency.
That means putting behind it a past of painful currency crises
and lifting heavy restrictions on the real .
 But in recent months the government has taken a step
backward, introducing even more regulation to the market in an
effort to curb a currency rally that is hurting exporters and
undermining the competitiveness of the Brazilian economy.
 ""It makes policymakers more reluctant to pursue full
convertibility under these circumstances,"" said Mike Moran, a
senior currency strategist at Standard Chartered in New York.
 ""They will continue to say this is their long term goal,
but in the immediate future, the prospect for full
convertibility for the likes of Brazil is very weak.""
 Currently, the central bank permits only a few big banks to
trade in the local market, making foreign exchange transactions
more costly and time-consuming for everybody else.
 But if these restrictions were lifted, Brazil's currency
problems would be even worse, some analysts say.
 Foreign investors have flocked to Brazil partly due to its
high-yielding bonds. The deluge of cash has boosted the real,
making it one of the world's most overvalued currencies.
 ""Convertibility? Forget about it,"" says Carlos Gandolfo, a
partner at Sao Paulo's Pioneer brokerage. A freely tradable
real would attract even more hot money, or ""motel money"" as it
is known locally -- thrill-seeking investors who are in and out
of the country in hours.
That is exactly the type of investor Brazil has been fending
off with recent intervention measures, such as tax rises on
foreign purchases of bonds.

Graphic on intervention: http://r.reuters.com/kuv79p

 Convertibility could also bring more volatility to the
market, as has been the case in Mexico, one of the few
countries in Latin America to have a convertible currency.
 BATTLE SCARS
 In March this year, Brazil's trading institutions got
together to launch 'Brain' -- the latest project to transform
the country into a financial superpower, with one of its goals
being to free up the local currency market.
 The project has been on hold for the past three to four
months because of Brazil's ongoing presidential election, said
Alan Gandelman, chief executive officer of the Brazil division
of ICAP, the world's biggest interdealer broker.
 ""The government wouldn't want (convertibility) now with the
real at these levels, but maybe four or five years down the
road it could be achieved,"" he said.
 However, it could take even longer if the global battle
over currency intervention, which dominated a G20 meeting last
week, proves to be part of a long-term structural shift.
 ""There has been a mistrust of what you used to call the
Washington Consensus of freely open capital markets, freely
convertible, freely floating currencies,"" said Win Thin, a
currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 But convertibility is not just up to the government: the
market also has to want it.
 If intervention were done ""in a way to lead investors to
believe that the risk of that currency had risen because of the
force of government intervention, I think it could have an
effect,"" said Gustavo Loyola, a former central bank president.
 In contrast, Chile has taken softer measures to deal with
its rallying currency, partly for fear that intervention will
delay plans to make the peso convertible.
 Despite its small size, Chile also dreams of becoming Latin
America's financial hub.
 Judging by the non-deliverable forward market, investors
are souring on trading the real.
 NDFs are derivatives that simulate trading in restricted
currencies such as the real. The contracts are mostly traded in
New York and settled in dollars.
 Trading in Brazilian NDFs is facing long-term decline and
should eventually die out when the real becomes convertible, as
has happened in other developing countries such as Russia.
 But after the government's tax rise last week on futures
contracts, ICAP saw volumes in Brazilian NDFs soar about 20-30
percent, said Anna Didier, head of NDFs for the broker.
 Other investors are weighing costs and contemplating coming
back to the market, she said, because even though NDFs are
expensive, the rules of the game are more transparent.
 ""Everyone is going back to the drawing board.""

By Jeremy Pelofsky
 WASHINGTON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Shannon Wren ran what
appeared to be a low-key computer business in Florida but had a
love for fast and fancy cars, spending hundreds of thousands of
dollars on a Rolls Royce, a Ferrari Spider, a Bentley Arnage
and motorcyles.
 He even had a side business featuring couture clothing.
However, his real moneymaker was allegedly selling fake
integrated circuits he imported from China and Hong Kong to
defense contractors and transportation firms, chips used in
virtually every piece of electronics equipment.
 Federal agents swooped in last month on Wren's VisionTech
Components' offices in Clearwater, Florida, arresting him and
his associate, Shannon McCloskey, and seizing his cars as well
as his companies' bank accounts.
 The pair face 10 counts of trafficking in counterfeit
goods, conspiracy, and fraud from generating almost $16 million
in revenue over three years, supplying chips to companies such
as BAE Systems and Alstom.
 While Wren and McCloskey pleaded not guilty to the charges
in a U.S. court in Washington last month, the case highlights
the growing sophistication of counterfeiters.
 The Justice Department launched an intellectual property
task force in February to focus on counterfeiting, trade secret
theft and piracy. They have begun hiring 51 new FBI agents and
15 additional prosecutors to focus solely on those cases.
 There's big money in counterfeiting as well as stealing
corporate trade secrets, which can save competitors millions of
research and development dollars by providing them with
shortcuts.
 MALICIOUS CODE
 In August a Chinese man with permanent resident status in
the United States was arrested and charged with stealing trade
secrets worth $300 million from a Dow Chemical Co unit related
to insecticides to benefit the Chinese government.
 Another couple in Michigan was accused in June of a scheme
to steal secrets about General Motors' motor control system for
hybrid vehicles and sell them to a Chinese automaker. GM put
the value of the stolen documents at more than $40 million.
 The concern with counterfeit chips is that they could be
inferior, which could lead to the device failing or have
malicious code embedded that would allow someone to hack into
it or intercept communications.
 ""Counterfeiting of computer components generally is of
significant concern to the government, even more so when those
counterfeit components are sold to the military or other
government agencies,"" Mike Dubose, chief of the Justice
Department's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section,
told Reuters.
 In the Florida case, the arrests of Wren and McCloskey were
particularly worrisome because they were selling circuits to
the defense industry that they passed off as being from firms
such as Texas Instruments Inc, National Semiconductor Corp and
Intel Corp.
 Military-grade circuits are designed to work despite
extreme hot or cold temperatures, including in space, and to
withstand extreme vibrations like in a missile or aircraft. As
a result, they cost more than commercial-grade chips.
 While the indictment did not say that the fake chips made
it into weapons systems, they were allegedly sold for use in
missiles and handheld radiation detectors as well as for
controlling high-speed trains.
 When the supplier for the trains complained that most of
the 2,000 circuits they bought did not work, Wren pleaded for
understanding.
 ""Please don't over analyze these parts, anybody can find
something wrong with a brand new Ferrari if we look hard
enough. Come on guys."" he said according to the indictment.

 * Important to overcome bottlenecks for scare raw materials
 
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BERLIN, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Germany must offer China more
than money in exchange for its scarce raw materials, and improve
its own energy infrastructure and recycling processes to address
commodity shortages, a German industry leader said on Tuesday.
 German goods and technology could be a currency with which
to secure a steady supply of Chinese raw materials crucial for
German manufacturing, said Ulrich Grillo, chairman of the German
Industry Federation's committee on raw materials policy.
 ""We have technology and goods that the Chinese would like to
have,"" Grillo told Reuters on the sidelines of a raw materials
conference in Berlin.
 Governments and industry worldwide have been rattled by
recent Chinese moves to limit its exports of raw materials -
particularly rare earths used in the production of high-tech and
defence goods as well as internet communication.
 The G20 group of rich and developing nations are due to
discuss the issue during a summit next month. 
 German policy should rapidly address possible bottlenecks
and alternative sources of the materials outside of China,
Grillo said in an interview.
 ""We have to put our foot on the accelerator. Our rivals
aren't waiting around,"" he said. 
 German Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle warned that
speculators have sent rare earth prices soaring and promised to
monitor raw materials pricing, but Grillo would not condemn
commodities traders.
 ""Speculators are not a bad thing in themselves. You need a
counterposition to your long-term plans,"" he said.
 Germany should work instead on a comprehensive policy
approach that would combine trade, development and foreign
policy and improve energy transit infrastructure.
 German firms should also be allowed to fully exploit the
country's sand and gravel resources and not be burdened by
requirements under the EU's emissions trading scheme, which aims
to the bloc's greenhouse gas emissions.
 Grillo applauded the German government's raw material
policy, unveiled earlier this month. But he said more needed to
be done to conserve materials already circulating in its
economy, through more efficient recycling and tighter customs
controls on illegal exports of scrap metal.
 While Germany should push for greater access to industrial
inputs there should be no lifting of tariffs that would benefit
foreign producers using illegal export pricing to squeeze out
European competitors, Grillo warned.
 Calls by the Italy earlier this year to suspend import
tariffs on certain raw materials have been rejected over
concerns such a move might undermine European producers.

 * New rules seen entering force in 6 months, officials say
 By Charlie Dunmore
 BRUSSELS, 26 Oct (Reuters) - The European Commission has
finalised draft legislation that would allow up to 0.1 percent
of unapproved genetically modified (GM) material in imports of
animal feed to the European Union, the bloc's executive said on
Tuesday.
 The draft rules, which must now be approved by EU member
states and lawmakers, are designed to avoid a repeat of last
year's disruption to EU animal feed supplies, when U.S. soy
cargoes were blocked after traces of unapproved GM material were
found.
 Last week, Spain received its first bulk maize cargo from
the United States in at least 12 years, which traders said could
be an early sign that imports of U.S. maize to Europe will
resume once the new rules are in place.
 But EU officials said that while the 0.1 percent limit would
have enabled some of the soy shipments blocked last year to
enter the EU, the level of GM contamination in some cases meant
the proposed solution would not have solved all the problems.
 The proposals adopted by the Commission were largely
unchanged from drafts seen by Reuters earlier this month,
details provided by officials showed.
 They introduce new harmonised rules for EU customs
authorities testing grain cargoes, which would require them to
approve feed for import provided the concentration of any
unapproved GM material discovered is below 0.1 percent.
 The limit will only apply to GMOs that have been approved in
the exporting country and for which an EU approval is pending.
 But the bloc's zero tolerance policy on unapproved GMOs in
food imports will remain in place, despite warnings from
exporting nations including the U.S., Brazil and Argentina that
different rules for food and feed will be unworkable in
practice.
 Similar concerns were raised by some Commission departments
during the drafting of the rules, and a clause has been added to
the text on the possible need to review the rules in future to
see whether they should also cover food imports, EU officials
said.
 The decision to exclude food from the new rules was taken
after several countries, including Germany, made it clear they
would not support any relaxation of the zero tolerance policy on
food.
 Environmentalists have said the EU should maintain a strict
zero tolerance policy on unapproved GM material in both feed and
food, and accused the Commission of caving in to pressure from
major exporting countries.
 The draft rules must get majority approval in a vote by EU
government experts, who are due to discuss the proposal on 15
November.
 EU ministers and lawmakers would then have three months to
either accept or reject the draft rules entirely, meaning the
earliest they could enter force is around April next year,
though EU officials said it would likely take six months or
more.

 By Mark Potter
 BERLIN, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The outlook for WPP, the world's
biggest advertising firm by sales, is set fair for the rest of
this year after a strong third quarter, chief executive Martin
Sorrell told Reuters on Tuesday.
 However, there is considerable uncertainty among clients
about prospects for 2011 ahead of mid-term U.S. elections and
amid concerns that debt crises might spread within the euro
zone, he said on the sidelines of the World Retail Congress.
 ""It's pretty set fair for the rest of the year,"" Sorrell
said when asked about business prospects.
 Organic revenue growth, which excludes acquisitions, was up
over 4 percent in the first nine months of the year, exceeding
the group's full-year target, and profit margins improved in the
third quarter compared with the same time last year, he added.
 Sorrell told reporters earlier that third-quarter results on
Friday would show the biggest rise in quarterly organic revenues
for ten years.
 Publicis, the world's third-largest ad group, said last week
it had nearly doubled its organic growth forecast for the year
to around 6 percent after its third-quarter figures beat
forecasts.
 
 UNCERTAINTY
 WPP's shares rose to a three-year high of 748.5 pence,
before falling back to trade down 2 percent at 729.5 pence by
1415 GMT, slightly underperforming the FTSE-100 index of leading
British companies.
 UBS analyst Alastair Reid cut his investment rating on WPP
shares to ""neutral"" from ""buy"", citing their strong recent gains
and uncertainty over the outlook for 2011.
 Sorrell said WPP's operating companies were probably more
bullish about prospects for 2011 than the centre of the
business, and were looking at organic revenue growth of 2-4
percent next year -- similar to analysts' expectations.
 But he stressed the budget had not been set for next year,
and it was a good idea to be conservative in order to maintain
discipline on costs.
 ""I think we'll see some rebalancing next year,"" he said,
adding WPP was unlikely to be able to continue growing at about
8 percent in the United States, but that growth in Asia, Latin
America, the Middle East and Africa looked set to pick up.
 Revenues from digital media and emerging markets both
accounted for about 28 percent of the group total, closing in on
targets to reach a third of total revenues, Sorrell said. 
 These targets were likely to be raised to a high 30s
percentage, or possibly 40 percent, he said.

document
 * Minister says lower production is cause of revenue drop
 * Algeria may be struggling to maintain production -analyst
 
 (Edits, adds analyst's comments in paragraphs 8-12) 
 By Hamid Ould Ahmed
 ALGIERS, Oct 26 (Reuters) - OPEC member Algeria expects its
energy production and exports to shrink in 2011, pushing
earnings from oil and gas down 4.5 percent on the forecast for
this year, the finance ministry said.
 Revenues from oil and gas sales abroad are set to decline to
$42.2 billion from the $44.2 billion forecast for this year,
according to a document drafted by the finance ministry, which
was obtained by Reuters.
 The forecasts in the document for 2010 and 2011 are both
made on the basis of a nominal average price for crude oil of
$60 per barrel, excluding the influence of price fluctuations on
the forecast revenues.
 Asked to explain the forecast drop in earnings for 2011,
Finance Minister Karim Djoudi told Reuters: ""It's because,
regarding quantities, production and exports will decline.""
 Algeria supplies about a fifth of Europe's energy needs and
is also the world's eighth largest crude exporter.
 The energy ministry did not respond to telephone calls
seeking comment, and finance ministry officials did not offer
any explanation for the forecast drop in energy output.
 
 PRODUCTION PROBLEMS?
 Energy analysts have said Algeria could cut exports in
response to low global demand and prices, especially for natural
gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG), preferring to hold onto its
reserves until prices recover.
 But most predictions are that demand will recover in 2011,
so there may be another explanation for Algeria's lower output
forecast, said Samuel Ciszuk, Senior Middle East and North
Africa energy analyst with IHS Global Insight.
 Many observers of Algeria's energy sector have been saying
that a shortage of foreign investment in new projects over the
past few years could start to have an impact on exports,
starting from about 2012.
 ""There's been stories about midstream crumbling, pipelines
being in a very bad state etc., but it's very hard to get the
real exact reasons for this,"" Ciszuk told Reuters.
 ""Maybe we are starting to see the problems coming to the
fore a bit earlier than thought.""
 An accident this year cut LNG production capacity by as much
as 20 percent, in what some analysts saw as a sign of broader
problems. Energy Minister Youcef Yousfi has said LNG capacity
will be back to normal within a few months..
 The finance ministry document, which was circulated to
members of parliament before debates on the 2011 draft budget,
forecast that the economic output of Algeria's energy sector
would shrink 0.8 percent next year.
 That will be the third successive year of negative growth
for the energy sector, the document showed. Overall, Algeria's
gross domestic product is forecast to grow 4 percent in 2011.
 Any reduction in energy revenues is likely to have a
significant impact on the economy of Algeria, a country of about
35 million people, as oil and gas accounts for more than 95
percent of its total exports.
 In previous years, the finance ministry has revised its
energy revenue forecasts after the budget was adopted to take
account of higher-than-expected world oil prices.

1256,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2010 10:00AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Hungarian private pension fund assets," Oct 26 (Reuters) - Hungary's parliament on Monday passed a
law to allow the members of mandatory private pension funds --
the second pillar of the country's pension system -- to leave
the funds, transferring their pension savings to the state.
 Moving back to the state pension system would be allowed
until the end of 2011 and the original elements of personal
portfolios would be transferred without the need to sell any of
the assets.
 The legal change goes along with another measure to channel
new private pension fund savings of about 420 billion forints
($2.12 billion) into the state system by the end of 2011.
 
 HUNGARY'S PENSION SYSTEM
 The 1997 pension reform added a mandatory private pension
fund pillar and an optional mutual fund pillar to the state
pension system inherited from the Communist regime before 1990.
 The aim of the reform was to make the pension system more
sustainable, increase the self-reliance of citizens and boost
domestic demand in the country's financial markets.
 The state-run pension fund has not invested in those markets
as it operates as a pay-as-you-go pool.
 Mandatory private pension funds have accumulated assets --
mainly government bonds and equities -- worth about 10 billion
euros ($14.04 billion) and have been important players in
domestic markets. The smaller mutual fund sector which is
not affected by the new government measures had assets worth
about 830 billion forints ($4.26 billion) at the end of June.
 Employers pay 24 percent of gross salaries to the state as
pension contribution. Employees pay 9.5 percent but in the case
of private fund members 8 percent went to the mandatory private
pillar and only 1.5 percent to the state. According to the new
measures the total 9.5 percent will go the state until end-2011.
 About 3 million of the 3.8 million workers are private fund
members as the reform did not oblige older workers to join the
new funds. Tens of thousands older than 52 years returned to the
state system in 2009 when the previous Socialist government
temporarily opened the gate.
 The funds flowing into the private funds instead of the
the state system have caused a gap each year in the state system
which accommodates the country's 3 million pensioners.
 The European Union recently rejected a call from 9 of its
members including Hungary to allow deducting the costs of
pension reform from state budget accounts.
 The new Hungarian measures wipe out that deficit at least
until the end of 2011, while returnees to the state also cut the
government's later liabilities towards the private funds.
 But long-term liabilities of the state in terms of pension
payments will increase.
 
 COMPOSITION OF PENSION FUND ASSETS
 Mandatory private pension funds manage assets in three
portfolio categories which differ in the risk accepted in
investment choices. The ""classical portfolios"" recommended to
older citizens take the lowest risk, relying on safe government
debt. The share of equities is higher in the ""balanced""
portfolios and the highest in the so-called ""growth"" portfolios
which have accumulated much more assets than the other two.
 If citizens and their personal portfolios move into the
state system from private funds, the assets in the second pillar
fall. Net market demand from the funds will also decline as the
returnees will no longer pay new savings into the funds.
 The size of the impact will depend on the number of
returnees, the composition of their portfolio and the
government' strategy for managing the assets taken over.

 * Salameh says Lebanon won't trade gold reserves
 * Salameh says won't cut dollar fx reserves
 * Confident Debt-to-GDP ratio at 140 percent in 2010
 * Studying idea to lift banks' reserve requirements
 
 By Yara Bayoumy and Dominic Evans
 BEIRUT, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Lebanon's central bank has no
intention of widening the band within which the Lebanese pound
trades against the dollar because it would encourage speculation
and hurt price stability, Governor Riad Salameh said on Tuesday.
 Political tensions this month increased demand for the
dollar, pushing it towards the outer end of the band at 1,514
Lebanese pounds, prompting the central bank to intervene and
sell dollars for the first time in two years, bankers said.
 Salameh said the central bank would continue its policy of
allowing the pound to fluctuate against the dollar in a tight
range between 1,501 pounds and 1,514 pounds.
 ""We shall not change the range I have talked about because
we believe that it will encourage speculation which can hurt the
stability of prices ... This could give a wrong message to the
market because it has been accustomed to this range for many
years now,"" Salameh told Reuters.
 ""... We know that in Lebanon a tight range is required to
keep things in order.""
 ""Whenever the market reaches 1,514, it should be expected
that we would be there to offer dollars and shall not allow the
dollar to go over this price,"" he said.
 The central bank intervened at the height of instability two
years ago, when street fights between supporters of Shi'ite
Hezbollah and Sunni followers of now Prime Minister Saad
al-Hariri nearly deteriorated into full-blown civil war.
 Political tensions revived after reports emerged that
indictments may be issued at the end of this year or early next
year against Hezbollah members for their alleged involvement in
the 2005 assassination of former prime minister Rafik al-Hariri.
 
 ANCHOR FOR CONFIDENCE
 ""Our statement is clear, we are going to maintain the
stability of the Lebanese pound because this is important as an
anchor for confidence, for price stability and to preserve the
purchasing power of the Lebanese,"" he said.
 ""We have shown in very difficult situations that we were
able to maintain a stable currency and therefore we see the
Lebanese pound as being stable in the future.""
 Salameh said the central bank had $31 billion in liquid
foreign assets, with foreign reserves divided between dollars
and euros in a ratio of 70:30, with no plans to change that
formula despite recent pressures on the dollar.
 Salameh said Lebanon also has no intention of buying or
selling gold, which it has in reserves worth nearly $12 billion.
 The central bank's stocks made it the second biggest holder
of gold in the Middle East and North Africa, and maintaining
those reserves was important to preserving confidence in the
Lebanese pound, Salameh said.
 
 BEYOND BASEL III 
 The governor said the central bank plans to set Lebanese
banks a much higher target for top quality capital reserves than
the levels agreed by international regulators in response to the
financial crisis.
 The banks should hold 10 percent of Tier 1 capital,
significantly higher than the 7 percent which Salameh said was
set out in the Basel III package.
 Salameh also said he was confident Lebanon, one of the most
highly indebted countries in the world, would reduce its
debt-to-GDP ratio to 140 percent by the end of the year from
about 147 percent in 2009.
 ""With the present rate of growth and the present rate of
inflation, yes we are confident that this will happen.""
 He said Lebanon's economy is expected to grow by between 7
percent and 8 percent this year, matching similar levels in 2008
and 2009, driven by strong consumer confidence and the business
community was indicating 2011 would be a ""good year"".
 Salameh said he hoped international ratings agencies would
lift the country's rating to BBB from B -- its rating from
Standard & Poor's and Fitch -- in the future.
 ""If you look at our performance in the markets, in terms of
credit default swaps or even interest rate levels ... we are
being priced by the market at levels of countries that are rated
BBB.""

1261,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2010 09:04AM ET</span>",UPDATE 4-India government warms to Wal-Mart's retail push," * Opening up to FDI to help farmers - food processing min
 * Food min says hopeful of opening up retail in 2011
 * Wal-Mart CEO says to buy directly from more India farmers
(Adds planning commission support paragraphs 6-7)
 By Ruchira Singh
 NEW DELHI, Oct 26 (Reuters) - India sounded a positive note
on Tuesday on opening up to foreign direct investment in the
massive and politically sensitive multi-brand retail sector by
global players like Wal-Mart and Carrefour.
 India's retail sector is largely closed to foreign firms and
favours small family-run stores, with 51 percent of FDI allowed
only in the single-brand retail sector. Multi-brand retail is
restricted to cash-and-carry or wholesale outlets.
 Opening up the sector would ease massive supply bottlenecks
that have contributed to keeping inflation stubbornly high in
India.
 Food Processing Minister Subodh Kant Sahai backed calls by
Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, to open up parts of the
tightly-regulated $450 billion retail sector and hoped this
would happen next year.
 ""I am in favour of it because this will give market-driven
farming to farmers,"" Sahai told reporters on Tuesday at an event
attended by visiting Wal-Mart Stores Chief Executive Mike Duke.
 India's Planning Commission also backed the proposal, Deputy
Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia said on Tuesday.
 ""There is absolutely no reason why we shouldn't allow
foreign direct investment,"" the powerful adviser told reporters.
 Still, it is not the first time the government has hinted at
relaxing the rules. Over the past few years the government has
moved forward on reforms only to backtrack in the face of local
opposition.
 Wal-Mart, in partnership with India's top telecoms group
Bharti Enterprise, operates four cash-and-carry outlets in
India.
 India, which along with China is leading annual economic
growth among major economies, is increasingly a hot investment
destination for global companies keen to tap into the massive,
decentralised yet heavily regulated market.
 
 POLITICAL MINEFIELD
 An estimated 40 percent of India's farm produce spoils
before reaching consumers -- an alarming statistic in a country
where millions go hungry. Cold storage is scarce and expensive.
 With family-run stores accounting for over 90 percent of
domestic trade, the issue remains a political minefield for a
ruling Congress party fearful of losing its populist appeal
through potential job losses and protests from farmers.
 Many local retailers still oppose relaxing restrictions for
fear that global titans will drive local stores out of business.
 But Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government has begun to
speak more positively recently on relaxing the rules, hoping the
benefits of such a move -- creating thousands of jobs and
reining in inflation by curbing waste -- would douse political
opposition.
 India's commerce and industry ministry in July released a
discussion paper on opening the sector, but it steered clear of
suggesting changes to the existing investment cap.
 Singh's political boss and Congress party chief Sonia Gandhi
has so far publicly been reluctant to embrace the changes, part
of a general slow pace of reforms that has frustrated many
foreign and local investors.
 Wal-Mart's Duke told reporters on Monday he was getting a
""very positive"" feeling from officials about further opening up
the sector to FDI. The company has for years sought greater
access to Asia's third largest economy.
 Duke said on Tuesday that Wal-Mart would step up direct
sourcing in India from farmers, aiming to raise this to 35,000
small and medium farmers by the end of 2015.
 ""We are currently buying fresh products direct from over 600
farmers and are working with them to increase their yields and
best practices,"" he said.

1262,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2010 09:00AM ET</span>",EXCLUSIVE-Algeria forecasts lower oil and gas output in 2011," ALGIERS, Oct 26 (Reuters) - OPEC member Algeria expects its
energy production and exports to shrink in 2011, pushing
earnings from oil and gas down 4.5 percent on the forecast for
this year, the finance ministry said.
 Revenues from oil and gas sales abroad are set to decline to
$42.2 billion from the $44.2 billion forecast for this year,
according to a document drafted by the finance ministry which
was obtained by Reuters.
 The forecasts in the document for 2010 and 2011 are both
made on the basis of a nominal average price for crude oil of
$60 per barrel, excluding the influence of price fluctuations on
the forecast revenues.
 Asked to explain the forecast drop in earnings for 2011,
Finance Minister Karim Djoudi told Reuters: ""It's because,
regarding quantities, production and exports will decline.""
 Algeria supplies about a fifth of Europe's energy needs and
is also the world's eighth largest crude exporter.
 The energy ministry did not respond to telephone calls
seeking comment, and finance ministry officials did not offer
any explanation for the forecast drop in energy output.
 However, energy analysts have said Algeria could cut exports
in response to low global demand and prices, especially for
natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG), preferring to hold
onto its reserves until prices recover.
 Algeria's LNG production capacity has also been cut by as
much as 20 percent by an accident..
 Algerian Energy Minister Youcef Yousfi has said though that
LNG capacity would be back to normal in a few months, and it was
not clear if the reduced capacity was a factor in the finance
ministry's forecast for 2011.
 The finance ministry document, which was circulated to
members of parliament before debates on the 2011 draft budget,
forecast that the economic output of Algeria's energy sector
would shrink 0.8 percent next year.
 That will be the third successive year of negative growth
for the energy sector, the document showed. Overall, Algeria's
gross domestic product is forecast to grow 4 percent in 2011.

 * Brussels resists German idea of suspending voting rights

(Recasts with Rehn comments)
 By Andreas Rinke and Jan Strupczewski
 BERLIN/BRUSSELS, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Germany insists the EU's
fundamental treaty must be changed to strengthen the bloc's
budget rules, government sources said on Tuesday, putting Berlin
at odds with the EU executive ahead of a summit later this week.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel and France's Nicolas Sarkozy last
week agreed the need for changes to EU law to make it possible
to suspend voting rights of EU states which seriously violate
the principles of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
 The German government sources said that without agreement on
such treaty changes, Germany would block approval of European
Council President Herman van Rompuy's proposals on reform, being
presented to EU leaders this week. [ID:nLDE69M0CK]
 ""For us this is a package,"" one of the German sources said,
adding that Germany would not back the van Rompuy report if no
deal was reached over the treaty alterations.
 Van Rompuy's Task Force report sets out a five-point plan to
improve EU budget discipline, including the provision of a wider
range of sanctions and measures, both financial and political.
[ID:nBRU011086]
 In general Germany supports the bulk of what the report
proposes.
 In Brussels, EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner
Olli Rehn indicated his reluctance over the German proposal that
countries violating the EU's budget rules should be stripped of
their voting rights at meetings of EU ministers.
 ""My personal view on the suspension of voting rights is that
it is not necessarily in line with the idea of an ever-closer
Union, which is in the treaty of the EU,"" Rehn told reporters.
 EU foreign ministers indicated on Monday that Germany and
France face an uphill battle to secure backing for a change to
the EU's fundamental treaty. [ID:nLDE69O1TQ]
 Rehn said the EU executive would also prefer to create a
permanent mechanism for crisis resolution in the euro zone
without changing the EU's main law.
 Germany and France have called for changes to the EU treaty
to accommodate a crisis-resolution mechanism that would replace
the current ad-hoc emergency lending funds for Greece and the
whole euro zone which end in 2013.
 ""We would by far prefer to do it without treaty change,""
Rehn said after addressing a conference.
 Such a treaty change would require the agreement of all 27
members of the bloc and is seen as very difficult.
 ""We are exploring the legal possibilities and constraints,
but we do not want to rule out treaty change concerning a crisis
resolution mechanism,"" he said.

 * Clients parked cash at lowbrow banks during crisis
 * Lowbrow rivals expand offering to retain rich clients

 By Edward Taylor and Martin de Sa'Pinto
 FRANKFURT/ZURICH, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Wealth managers like
Credit Suisse and UBS, already struggling to raise private
banking margins amid client caution, are faced with a new
threat: lowbrow banks chasing wealthy customers.
 Spooked by the credit crisis, some ultra-wealthy clients in
Europe sought a safe haven for their cash away from wealth
management firms with investment banking operations, and parked
their money in low-end but conservative cooperative and savings
banks instead.
 Although the shift will likely prove to be temporary, it has
given ultra-wealthy clients a lasting taste for the services --
and value -- offered by lowbrow banks at a time when big banks
are seeking to defend their sagging margins.
""There is a general trend from Rolls-Royce banking to Skoda.
That adds pressure to margins,"" said Peter Thorne, banking
analyst at Helvea.
 In its wealth management division, excluding the Americas,
UBS saw gross margins drop to 89 basis points in the third
quarter, from 95 basis points in the second quarter, and down
from 92 basis points in the third quarter 2009.
 A similar trend is evident at Credit Suisse, where the gross
margin in wealth management fell to 118 basis points in the
third quarter, down from 131 basis points for full year 2009. 
 Credit Suisse said lower margins stem mainly from a lack of
demand for high margin services, and that the Swiss bank is
""ideally positioned"" to benefit when the environment improves.

 LOWBROW OFFERING
 Bread-and-butter banks like cooperative lender DZ Bank are
aggressively expanding their wealth management offerings in a
bid to retain the wealthy client base. 
 ""The Lehman failure and other bank rescues led many clients
to return to the bank around the corner,"" said a WGZ Bank
spokesman.
 Between 2008 and 2009, cash deposits among the 30 million
clients of Germany's cooperative banking sector jumped 29.8
percent to 203 billion euros, data shows. 
 A similar jump of 30 percent in cash deposits is evident
among the savings banks, according to data from the DSGV
industry association, though not all of this is from clients
defecting from the big wealth managers.
 The push by smaller German banks to increase their service
offerings mirrors a similar pattern seen in Switzerland where
cantonal banks successfully expanded their wealth management
product offering.
 Assets under management at Banque Cantonale de Geneve (BCGE)
rose to 18 billion Swiss francs in 2009 from 16 billion francs
a year earlier. Net new money accounted for 1 billion francs of
the increase.
 Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB) launched a physically backed
gold exchange traded fund (ETF) in 2006. The Swiss-German lender
now has 7.7 billion Swiss francs in that product, and a total of
10.2 billion francs in its precious metals ETFs.
 From the end of 2008 to mid 2010, assets under management at
ZKB grew more than 17 percent to 156 billion Swiss francs. Net
new money was 6.7 billion francs for 2009 and 5.3 billion francs
in the first half of 2010, more than half from private clients.
 
 MONEY RETURNS
 Despite shrinking margins, UBS reported positive inflows in
its Wealth Management division in the third quarter, after
losing client money in the first half of 2010, and in the
previous two years.
 ""Sparkassen provided a safe haven for high net worth
individuals,"" said Josef Stadler, head of high net worth
individuals at UBS. ""Money is flowing back to banks that can
cater to sophisticated needs."" 
 But the presence of the lowbrow players will ensure that
margins in wealth management will continue to come under
pressure in some of the key markets where UBS and Credit Suisse
are seeking to expand, like Germany, Europe's largest economy.
 Thanks to a raft of regulatory changes seeking to clamp down
on tax evasion, wealthy clients are increasingly being
encouraged to bank locally, a trend that is crimping the
traditionally higher ""offshore"" margins.
 For decades Switzerland high end banks relied heavily on the
traditional ""offshore"" business -- whereby clients from abroad
move their money to the alpine nation.
Clients taking advantage of offshore services tended to place
a premium on sophisticated and higher margin services such as
currency hedging and direct market access trading, as well as on
client confidentiality, but that premium is now shrinking.
 ""There will have to be convergence between onshore and
offshore margins,"" said Leigh Robertson, Chief Financial Officer
of HSBC private bank.
 Local banks won't give up their gains without a struggle,
and some say they are managing to keep hold of their financial
crisis spoils.
 Said a BCGE spokesman: ""The money coming in has slowed since
the crisis began to abate, but it is not going back out.""

 * Shah Deniz gas venture unaffected - UK govt source

(Adds quotes, detail, background)
 By Pete Harrison
 BRUSSELS, Oct 26 (Reuters) - European sanctions over Iran's
nuclear programme are likely to lead to the closure of a
Scottish gas field jointly owned by the Islamic Republic and
energy group BP, EU authorities said on Tuesday.
 The sanctions are expected to become law on Wednesday,
putting extra pressure on Tehran to return to negotiations over
its uranium enrichment programme.
 That could also lead to the closure of the Rhum gas field,
390 km (240 miles) to the northeast of Scotland, which BP has
been developing with the Iranian Oil Company since 2003.
 ""The UK authorities have informed the Commission that the
Iranian sanctions legislation is likely to cause the closure of
this field,"" said a spokesman for EU foreign affairs chief
Catherine Ashton.
 ""It shows that the UK authorities are ready to take the
difficult decisions that are necessary to make the sanctions
effective,"" the spokesman said.
 In a separate development underlining Tehran's determination
to push ahead with its nuclear programme, Iran began loading
fuel into the core of its first nuclear power plant on Tuesday,
one of the last steps to realising its stated goal of becoming a
peaceful nuclear power, state television reported.
 The EU sanctions, launched in July, block oil and gas
investment in Iran and curtail Tehran's refining and natural gas
capability.
 But they are unlikely to have an impact on another BP joint
venture with an Iranian company, the Shah Deniz gas field in
Azerbaijan, said a British government source.
 Britain's foreign office said it was up to individual
companies to make sure they comply with the sanctions, which
were finalised by EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday.
 ""That is the European Union using its collective weight in
the world, absolutely in the right way, working with the United
States and sending a clear message to Iran that it is important
to negotiate on its nuclear programme,"" British Foreign
Secretary William Hague said at that meeting.
 A spokesman for BP said the company was waiting to see the
details of the legislation when it is published this week. ""We
will ensure that Rhum complies with the regulations,"" he added.
 Rhum produced up to 6 million cubic metres of gas a day in
the first six months of 2010, according to government figures,
or about 1 percent of Britain's peak gas demand forecast for
this winter.
 ""We do not anticipate that the sanctions will have any
significant impact on UK energy supplies or the UK energy
market,"" said a UK foreign office spokeswoman.

 * Powerbroker Ozawa scandal issue shouldn't delay budget
 * Passing extra budget could be model for divided parliament
 By Linda Sieg
 TOKYO, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Japan needs to forge more free
trade deals for future growth, but must address the impact on its
farmers as a condition of joining a U.S.-led Asia-Pacific
initiative, a top party official said on Tuesday.
 Business lobbies, worried Japan is lagging behind rivals such
as South Korea, want Prime Minister Naoto Kan to offer to take
part in the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) when he
hosts the Nov. 13-14 Asia-Pacific Cooperation (APEC) summit,
which President Barack Obama will attend.
 But many Democratic lawmakers fear fallout from such trade
deals on Japan's long-protected and politically powerful farmers.
 ""As a general direction, we agree with the TPP as something
that would advance free trade in the Asia-Pacific region. The
problem is a matter of timing -- whether Japan will take part
early on,"" Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) Secretary-general
Katsuya Okada told Reuters in an interview.
 ""Of course, there will be an impact on primary industries ...
Unless we have policies to deal with that at the same time, we
cannot win public understanding.""
 Okada, 57, a former DPJ leader, served as foreign minister
after the party swept to power for the first time last year
promising to change how Japan is governed. He took on the No. 2
party position when Kan reshuffled his cabinet in September.
 Okada expressed confidence that a planned 4.4 trillion yen
($54.45 billion) extra budget for the fiscal year to March --
needed to prop up an economy now faltering as the yen flirts with
postwar highs -- would not be derailed by opposition demands for
the DPJ to drop key campaign pledges or for DPJ powerbroker
Ichiro Ozawa to testify about a funding scandal.
 OZAWA CONUNDRUM
 ""This is an extra budget closely related to the people's
livelihoods and in a situation where the yen is rising and the
economic outlook is very difficult, it is vital to enact it
quickly,"" Okada said.
 But he stopped short of saying whether he would urge Ozawa,
who faces indictment over the scandal, to appear in parliament.
 Opposition parties are pressing for Ozawa to give sworn
testimony in parliament. Japanese media have said a possible
compromise would be for the 68-year-old political heavyweight to
appear before an ethics panel, which does not requiring testimony
under oath. But it remains uncertain whether Ozawa would agree.
 ""This issue is basically a matter for Mr Ozawa himself. We
want to respect his decision,"" Okada said. ""But we must not allow
the budget to be delayed as a result.""
 Ozawa lost a challenge against Kan for the party leadership
last month, but still has a big following in the party, so DPJ
leaders are reluctant to anger him and risk a split.
 Okada said he hoped enactment of the extra budget would point
the way forward as the Democrats struggle with a divided
parliament, where opposition parties control the upper house and
can block bills.
 Analysts say the easiest option for the Democrats would be to
tie up with the second-largest opposition party, the New Komeito,
which tends to share its consumer-oriented policy stance. But
changing sides may not be that easy for the party, a former
partner of the long-dominant Liberal Democrats ousted last year.
 ""We want to make the extra budget a test case ahead of the
regular session of parliament. We are trying to create a model of
how we can manage the country in a stable fashion,"" Okada said.
 ""What would be best is to get opposition agreement based on
content (of bills). Or, if we lack the numbers, it may be
necessary to find a partner.""

 By Doug Palmer in Washington and Melanie Lee in Guangzhou
 WASHINGTON/GUANGZHOU, China, Oct 26, (Reuters) - Anybody
could tell right away that the Louis Vuitton shoulder bag was
fake because it was delivered in a recycled box that once
shipped batteries.
 Warnings printed on the inside of the box read: ""Danger
Contains Sulfuric Acid"" and ""Poison - Causes Severe Burns"" --
not the sort of messages that would normally accompany a
product from one of the world's most iconic luxury brands.
 But it sure looked real. It was dark brown, sported a
braided strap with brass fittings and the Louis Vuitton
monogramme stamped all across the bag.
 I had ordered the bag from a website called www.ericwhy.com
for this special report, which explores the growing problem of
counterfeit merchandise sold over the Internet.
 Reuters wanted to trace the problem from a consumer in
Washington D.C. to the shadowy producers based in Guangzhou
China, where my colleague Melanie Lee found the illicit
workshops and markets.
 Ericwhy, based in Guangzhou, calls its stuff
""designer-inspired alternative to actual Louis Vuitton"" in a
disclaimer on its website. ""We assume no civil or criminal
liability for the actions of those who buy our products.""
 Yet, U.S. law enforcement officials say this website and
many others that offer a dazzling array of goods online --
clothes, electronics, footwear, watches, medicines -- are
outlaws, and they plan to go after them hard.
 Counterfeit commerce over the Internet has soared in the
past couple of years, turning what had been an irritant to
businesses into a serious competitive threat, the officials
say.
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
estimates the amount of counterfeit goods and pirated
copyrights in world trade grew from about $100 billion in 2001
to about $250 billion in 2007, the last year for which they
have made an estimate. While there are no separate estimates
for how much of that is sold on the Internet, authorities say
it is considerable.
 ""The Internet has just completely changed the face of the
problem, made it more complicated and more pervasive,"" says
John Morton, assistant secretary in charge of U.S. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement (ICE). ""Whole industries now have been
attacked, not from the street, but from the Internet.""
 Visitors to www.ericwhy.com can choose from more than 1,800
imitation Louis Vuitton bags, ranging from a pink shoulder tote
and a tiger-coloured ""Whisper bag"" to a simple bright red
clutch.
 The one I ordered cost $122 with a $40 shipping fee, so by
my definition it was not exactly cheap. But comparable bags
sold at a local Louis Vuitton retail store were $1,000 or more.
 I entered my Washington D.C. address and credit card
information, and instantly got an email from my credit card
company warning of possible fraud on my account. Soon, I
received a second email, this one a receipt with a Worldwide
Express Mail Service (EMS) tracking number so I could follow my
package.
 The bag left Guangzhou, China on Sept. 14 and arrived on my
desk by the 20th. It was wrapped in a yellow sheath with the
Louis Vuitton logo and smelled strongly of leather.
 But in another sign something was not quite right, the
English instructions that came with it read: ""Louis Vuitton has
created for you prestigious glazed leather"" -- the sentence
ending abruptly without the word ""bag.""
 I took the bag to a Louis Vuitton store in Chevy Chase,
Maryland to see how it compared with the real article. The
store clerk, a tall man in a stylish suit, was restrained. ""We
only talk about our own products,"" he said icily, adding ""we
don't have any bags like that.""
 That Louis Vuitton doesn't want its store personnel to talk
about how easily their products can be copied is perhaps
understandable. If word got around fake bags were on the
street, then people might begin to wonder if their own bags
were real. Part of the brand's cachet is its exclusivity, which
easily available counterfeits devalue.
 Last year, U.S. customs and other law enforcement agents
made nearly 15,000 seizures of counterfeit goods, 80 percent of
which came from China. Handbags were third on the list, behind
consumer electronics and footwear -- the top item for four
consecutive years.
 ""They aren't just selling counterfeit clothing or
electronics,"" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told an
intellectual property conference in Hong Kong last week.
 ""They're selling defective and dangerous imitations of
critical components, like brake pads, or everyday consumer
goods, like toothpaste. They're conducting corporate espionage.
They're pirating music, movies, games, software and other
copyrighted works -- both on our cities' streets and online.
And the consequences are devastating.""
 When it comes to making counterfeit goods and pirating
brands, China is the counterfeit ""workshop of the world"". Along
with a relentlessly widening U.S. trade deficit, which
Washington blames on China's undervalued currency, rampant
piracy is stoking economic tensions between two of the world's
biggest economies.
 SHADY FACTORIES
 The grubby town of Shiling, an hour's drive from the
southern port of Guangzhou, has the biggest leatherworking
industry in China. In the 1980s, multinationals from various
industries began outsourcing production to factories in the
coastal provinces. In this part of Guangdong province, it was
leather.
 By the late 1990s, low-budget workshops in inconspicuous
neighbourhoods near the outsourcing factories had sprung up
making fake versions of the products. Today, much of Shiling's
leather goods are destined for the counterfeit trade.
 At one such workshop near Shiling Secondary School, women
and their young daughters could be seen cutting and sewing
leather by the windows. Lanky men loitered on the ground floor
by a ""help wanted"" poster seeking leather workers, serving as
lookouts.
 These places are occasionally targeted for police raids.
 Zhou She, a private investigator whose job is to sniff out
illicit hives of counterfeiting operations, told us about this
cluster of workshops, but we must act discreetly, he says.
 Walking gingerly around the three-storey shop-house
factories and watching men and women pound metal hardware into
leather in the back alleys, it feels like we are in a pirates'
lair.
 Police officials say organised crime gangs, sometimes
called triads in this part of China, are deeply involved, given
their extensive underground networks. ""Of course they are
involved. It is very low risk for them,"" Zhou said.
 He works the detective gumshoe routine, spending hours
trailing trucks carrying suspected cargo in and out of Shiling,
conducting camera surveillance and interviews.
 A former Peoples' Liberation Army intelligence officer,
Zhou, who has been in the industry for 12 years, has the
tanned, leathery skin and sharp crew cut of a military man. His
austere presence is betrayed only by a brown, expensive-looking
leather purse, which he showed off proudly -- a gift from an
Italian client after he found a counterfeit workshop for them.
 Luxury brands hire him to gather information on the
location of warehouses and factories, who then use that
evidence to persuade Chinese police to conduct a raid.
 The workshops take real luxury handbags and reverse
engineer them. Everything from the metal fittings to the
monogrammed leather of a Louis Vuitton bag is produced in
China.
 After it is put together at one of the workshops in
Shiling, the bag usually winds up in nearby Baiyun, by the old
airport in northern Guangzhou.
 SPILLING OUT OF STORES
 The Guangzhou Baiyun World Leather market is the epicentre
of the world's counterfeit trade when it comes to wholesaling
fake leather goods and apparel, experts say.
 Counterfeit Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada, and Hermes
handbags literally spill out of shops that occupy commercial
space the size of five football fields. Smaller stores provide
auxiliary products, such as counterfeit paper bags, receipts
and catalogues for wholesalers.
 Gina, who declined to give her surname, is one such
wholesaler from Colonia, Uruguay. Tugging a large, gray Louis
Vuitton suitcase through the narrow paths of the leather market
with her 66-year-old mother in tow, she is looking for a shop
that can make Louis Vuitton satchels out of ""pleather""
(synthetic leather).
 ""Don't worry, she can manage, we are very used to this,""
Gina said as her arthritic mother slowly shuffles forward,
carrying bags laden with fake scarves and leather goods, before
they stop at a bag shop.
 ""I don't need real leather, just pleather. No need to be
5-As, just double A enough,"" Gina told the shopkeeper in
heavily accented English.
 She has travelled halfway around the world to Baiyun to
make a personal connection in the world's largest market for
counterfeit leather goods. ""I used to buy online from China,
but after one bad experience, I said never again!"" She said she
wound up taking delivery of 800 bags in red instead of the
black she ordered.
 Gina was looking for a factory that can make 500 satchels,
which she planned to ship to Argentina before bringing them
into Uruguay where she has a beachfront store. It's less
suspicious to bring it over the border than have it come
directly from China. Clutching sheets of paper with
information about the bags she wants made, Gina, with her
streaked blond hair, tanned skin and branded accessories,
looked more like a Hollywood fashonista than somebody's idea of
a pirate. ""I've been in this business for eight years now,"" she
said. ""It's a good business.""
 Indeed, while criminal syndicates are getting increasingly
involved in the counterfeit trade, both in the United States
and China, authorities say, it is ordinary folks like Gina and
the shopkeepers she deals with who are the face of the
counterfeit business in China.
 HALF-HEARTED ENFORCEMENT
 Guangzhou authorities occasionally raid the Baiyun market,
including the day Reuters journalists visited there. Shops,
tipped to the impending raid, dutifully closed their doors,
though customers only had to knock to be let in
surreptitiously.
 ""They are raiding now. I don't know when it will end. It's
because of the Asian Games,"" said one shopkeeper. Guangzhou is
hosting the games in November.
 After a few minutes, the raid apparently ends with no
arrests made. Shop owners slide off their stools, fling open
their glass doors and stand outside beaming and beckoning at
customers again. They don't cater to tourists, but sell in bulk
to wholesalers such as Gina. Each shop claimed to have a
factory backing it.
 In the basement of the stores are the shippers, who
expertly pack and label the items so they sail through customs.
 ""If you want to send to France, it is a bit hard, because
they check thoroughly. But sending via UPS has an 80 percent
success rate,"" said one such shipper named Chen, who like the
others interviewed in China for this story, declined to give
his full name to avoid getting in trouble.
 They will also route shipments through ports in the Middle
East or Africa to avoid detection by customs in the European
Union and the United States, he said.
 Sitting on a small stool in a Baiyun shop, Gary, a
30-year-old Congolese, represents another branch of the
industry -- the intermediary. Speaking Mandarin to a
shopkeeper and switching to French for his three African
clients, he was trying to put together a deal on counterfeit
Italian Miu Miu bags.
 He came to China two years ago to study, but has made
helping European and African clients buy fakes a thriving side
business.
 ""I buy a lot and pack them in boxes of 10. Then I ship them
to England and then I drive (them) into France and they get
picked up,"" Gary whispered in Mandarin. ""It's a sensitive
business,"" he said with his baseball cap shoved low on his
head.
 Similarly, Nana, 30, a native of Moscow, has lived in
Guangzhou for four years. She was buying fake Tommy Hilfinger
and Gucci clothes in Baiyung, which she planned to supply to 20
websites in Russia.
 Few if any foreigners are ever caught or prosecuted, and
not many locals, either. China's counterfeit industry employs
millions of workers, distributors and shop clerks across the
nation, one reason why authorities have often been half-hearted
in their enforcement measures.
 But last week, the government said it would soon launch a
six-month crackdown on piracy and trademark infringement. The
illicit traders ""upset the market's normal order, impair the
competitive strength and innovation of businesses, and hurt
China's image abroad"", the State Council, or Cabinet, said in a
statement.
 In the second half of last year, China's customs department
seized 2.6 million counterfeit items from the country's postal
and express consignments, Meng Yang, a director general in the
customs department, said in a speech in Shanghai last month.
That's probably just a small fraction of the total trade in
China, experts say, given the amount of fake merchandise from
China seized abroad.
 NEW WEAPONS AGAINST PIRATES
 Back in Washington, I handed over the fake Louis Vuitton
bag down to the National Intellectual Property Rights
Coordination Center. Federal agents, standing in front of a
display case of counterfeit shampoo, condoms, medicine and
other products seized over the years, good-naturedly accept the
bag. They said it was much better quality than the ones they
had brought in to show me.
 The new center is a partnership among a dozen federal law
enforcement agencies and the Mexican government. Richard
Halverson, its chief for outreach and training, said U.S.
customs officials and postal inspectors have been on the
lookout for counterfeit goods from China, but can't catch every
one.
 The money to be made selling counterfeit goods is so good
""we have seen organised crime groups, what you would consider
drug trafficking groups, actually move away from some of those
other crimes into the counterfeit goods trade because it is a
high-profit, low-risk cash business -- the prime things that
criminals are looking for,"" Halverson said.
 It may seem harmless enough, but a consumer surfing the web
looking for a good deal on prescription drugs, for example,
needs to beware. ""You may be looking at what you believe to be
a Canadian pharmacy, when in fact the drugs are being
manufactured in India, the site is being run out of China, and
your payment is going to another group in Russia,"" Halverson
said.
 In the 2009 budget year, U.S. Customs agents and other
officials made 14,481 seizures valued at $260.7 million
dollars. When the final tally for 2010 budget year is in, the
figures will be much higher, Halverson said, noting that in
just one operation U.S. agents in Baltimore working with London
police seized eight containers of counterfeit shoes and
handbags.
 One recent IPR Center enforcement action, called ""Operation
in Our Sites"" seized the domain names of seven websites that
allow visitors to stream or illegally download first-run
movies, often just within hours of hitting the theatres.
 Halverson took me to the IPR's operations room, where
undercover agents search out websites and plot ways to disrupt
them. The room, with a huge video monitor on the far wall, also
functions as a command post to run operations in the field.
 ""Our undercover operation here is just Internet-based. We
don't have any face-to-face meetings,"" one agent said,
explaining they use ""undercover computers"" that allow them to
trawl for counterfeiters without being identified.
 After making a buy and confirming it is a counterfeit item,
ICE agents will get a court order to seize the site's domain
name and shut it down. But a longer criminal investigation is
required to seize assets and put people in jail, the agent
said.
 Many owners of the domain names, such as Ericwhy, are
overseas, making it difficult for U.S. law enforcement to go
after them. So often the most viable option is to close the
site, another agent said.
 ORGANISED CRIME LINKS
 While it often seems the counterfeit industry in China is
mostly Mom and Pop, Washington sees the problems caused by fake
goods as much bigger and more sinister than many imagine.
""Counterfeiting and piracy is increasingly the focus of
organised crime,"" said Morton, who heads ICE, the U.S.
government's second-largest criminal investigation agency after
the FBI.
 ""There's a lot of money in it and you need a fairly
sophisticated operation to pull it off. You need an ability to
manufacture goods on a grand scale, you need a shipping
network,"" Morton said in an interview in his office at ICE
headquarters with a view of the Washington Monument and Potomac
River.
 ""It literally affects every segment of American
manufacturing and business,"" he continued, ticking off
examples: ""Counterfeit aircraft engine parts, counterfeit ball
bearings for machines, counterfeit pharmaceuticals, counterfeit
electronics.""
 The Internet has made it much easier for unscrupulous
companies to sell fake or pirated goods. ""You don't have to go
to the corner of Fourth and Main to buy your fake Gucci
handbag. You can order it over the Internet,"" Morton said.
 Counterfeit products are also increasingly sophisticated
and hard to distinguish from the real thing. In the old days,
Morton said, everyone knew an item was a knock-off because it
looked like a cheaper version of the original. But now,
counterfeiters want to mimic the item as closely as possible to
get higher prices and profits.
 One new tool Washington hopes will help in the
international fight is a proposed Anti-Counterfeiting Trade
Agreement. Negotiators from the United States, the 27 nations
of the European Union, Japan, Australia, Canada, South Korea,
Mexico, Morocco, Singapore and Switzerland reached a tentative
agreement in late September on the pact, which has been years
in the making.
 With support from groups such as the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce and the Business Software Alliance, Congress is
preparing legislation giving the U.S. Justice Department broad
new powers to take down ""rogue websites,"" both at home and
overseas. [ID:nSGE69L0C8]
 ""Sites like this one (ericwhy.com) are stealing the ideas
and designs of legitimate, hardworking manufacturers to line
the pockets of foreign criminal networks,"" said Rob Calia,
senior director for counterfeiting and piracy at the U.S.
Chamber.
 ""It's theft, plain and simple, and it's hurting our
economy.""
 INTERNET CHAT ROOMS
 It is on the Internet where counterfeit traders in China
are finding a growing market, not to mention a safer place from
which to deal. Chat rooms on sites such as thefashionspot.com
are dedicated solely to finding suppliers and discussing bags.
Other sites such as Replica Underground offer members direct
links to Chinese suppliers.
 The consensus in the chat rooms is that the best quality
fakes that can be bought from websites come from Jacky, Catty
and Joy -- all pseudonyms.
 Joy, 30, started selling fake Louis Vuittons as a sideline.
Having spent a couple of years overseas, she banters with
potential customers on her website in flawless English. But
behind the cheery facade is a troubled pirate.
 ""I am worried every day about being caught,"" Joy told
Reuters in an email interview. ""The old Chinese saying goes:
It's a dagger hanging on top of my heart. I've been trying to
get out of the business since day one. I have tried everything.
I even started my own brand, but nothing sells like replicas,""
she said.
 Catty, who has been in the business of making
""mirror-image"" Chanel bags for six years, sells 2,000 to 3,000
bags a month to customers all over the world, for about $100
each. Under Chinese law, that size of operation surpasses the
threshold required to begin a criminal investigation, as
opposed to a civil fine.
 ""Yes, I am so afraid of getting caught, but in China many,
many people do this job. You can find many people doing my job
on iOffer, Taobao and Ebay,"" Catty said in an email interview,
referring to online auction sites.
 The online merchandising trend, and shipping via small
parcels, has made it increasingly hard for authorities to track
the extent of the problem.
 ""Traditionally, we'd find a few containers every year and
they're nice figures to report,"" said John Taylor, an official
with the European Union IPR enforcement unit. ""But now there
are less containers identified, and customs is working almost
twice as hard to find as many products because of the growing
trend for consumers to buy items over the Internet,"" he told
Reuters.
 Ebay, which has lost lawsuits in France to Louis Vuitton
for not policing the site for fakes actively enough, said the
firm has made an increased effort of late.
 ""We're serious about it. We vet Chinese sellers. If China
is going to connect with the rest of the world, China has to
confront piracy and counterfeits themselves,"" Ebay's Chief
Executive John Donahue told Reuters in an interview.
 Jack Chang is a veteran campaigner against counterfeit
goods. As chairman of China's leading intellectual property
protection group, the Quality Brands Protection Committee, he
has worked with the Chinese government to make enforcement a
priority.
China's dual system for counterfeit goods enforcement, with
duties shared between China's administrative authorities and
its police, provides enforcement options for brand owners. But
it also forms one of the biggest problems in cracking down on
the illicit industry. 
Under Chinese law, a counterfeit case is not subject to
criminal investigation unless it surpasses a certain value or
volume threshold. However, unless an investigation is made, it
is nearly impossible to know the magnitude of the
counterfeiting. Without evidence to prove that the threshold is
met, the police cannot start the investigation. ""It's a which
came first situation: the chicken or the egg,"" Chang said.
 Adding to the problem are the sheer numbers of Mom and Pop
stores selling these goods.
 ""It's a never-ending story. Every time you hit one, another
one pops up somewhere else, and you have to hit it again. So
it's tough,"" Jean Cassegrain, chief executive of French luxury
house Longchamp, told Reuters.
 FRUSTRATION WITH CHINA
 On Capitol Hill, frustration with China's pirates is adding
to rising tensions with China over a range of issues, including
the trade deficit and other unfair trade practices they say are
taking away American jobs.
 Sen. Byron Dorgan, Democrat from North Dakota, was
conducting a recent hearing on pirated movies, as chairman of a
watchdog panel set up after China and the United States
normalised trade ties in 2000.
 Many thought China's entry into the World Trade
Organization would create a boom for U.S. exports. Instead, the
trade gap has gotten worse year after year, with the deficit on
track this year to reach about $250 billion.
 Dorgan is grilling Greg Frazier, a vice president at the
Motion Picture Association of America, about how Washington
ended up agreeing to limit the number of foreign films that can
be shown in China to just 20 a year under the WTO pact.
 The U.S. movie industry believes the quota has fuelled the
huge market for pirated DVDs and illegal Internet downloads.
""Here is the paradox: there's an abundance of American movies
in China but most of them are pirated,"" Frazier told the
hearing.
 China's policing of the Internet for pornography and
political content raises questions why it can't do the same for
sites that offer pirated or counterfeit goods, legislators say.
 ""We know the Chinese government could be doing far more --
far, far more -- to protect intellectual property rights,"" Rep.
Sander Levin, a Democrat from Detroit, tells the hearing.
""There's a widening chasm between what we hear from the Chinese
government about IPR protection and what we know to be true.""

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The dollar steadied on Tuesday,
with investors wary of pushing it lower due to some uncertainty
about what easing measures the Federal Reserve may take next
week, while UK economic growth figures lifted sterling.
 The Swedish crown was the other significant mover, falling
sharply after the central bank raised interest rates as expected
but said future rate hikes would be more gradual than previously
expected. [ID:nLDE69P0NR]
 The market expects the U.S. Fed to opt for more quantitative
easing (QE) next week, but some easing is seen priced into an
already weak dollar. How much QE the Fed decides on and how
gradually it will implement is uncertain, keeping investors edgy
about building more bearish bets on the dollar.
 It rose against the yen, edging away from 15-year lows after
Japan's finance minister Yoshihiko Noda warned the government
would ""act decisively"" in currency markets if needed.
[ID:nTOE69O09F]
 His comments pushed the greenback back above 81 yen, with
traders citing buying from Japanese life insurers and banks,
among others, on the view that Japan may intervene if the dollar
nears 80.00 yen.
 ""Japan has pointed out quite clearly that they will
intervene in dollar/yen if it falls too quickly and the market
is aware there is no easy one-way bet on dollar/yen downside,""
said Stephan Maier, currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 ""Everything is dependent on the FOMC (U.S. Federal Open
Market Committee) and people don't want to take aggressive
positions ahead of this very big decision,"" he said.
 At 1120 GMT, the dollar was up 0.47 percent at 81.14 yen
. It hit a 15-year trough at 80.41 yen on Monday, taking
it near its record low of 79.75 yen, struck in April 1995.
 Against a basket of currencies <.DXY> the dollar was up 0.26
percent at 77.313. It has support around 76.00-10, just below
its Oct. 15 low of 76.144 while resistance is seen at 78.40.
 The euro fell 0.26 percent to $1.3926  after failing
to close above $1.4000 on Monday. The euro has support at
1.3860, its low on Friday, and its 21-day moving average at
$1.3866.
 ""The dollar is in a bit of a holding pattern. The market is
still mulling over the U.S. QE story and dollar selling is a bit
less of a one-way bet than it was,"" said Jeremy Stretch,
currency strategist at CIBC.

 STERLING JUMPS, SWEDISH CROWN FALLS
 Sterling was a clear outperformer, rising 1 percent against

showed the UK economy grew 0.8 percent in the third quarter,
twice as much as economists had forecast. [ID:nLDE69P0VZ]
 Growth still slowed from the second quarter but the data
bolstered the pound as investors saw less chance that the Bank

Sterling extended gains after S&P rating agency raised its

 The Swedish crown fell broadly meanwhile, with the euro
rising more than 1 percent to 9.2830 crowns .
 Analysts said the 25 basis point hike in interest rates had
already been priced into the crown, while the surprise news of a
slower tightening path tempered investors' recent bullish view
on the currency.
 ""The market had been pricing in a hike, and now the Riksbank

1270,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2010 07:24AM ET</span>",INTERVIEW-UPDATE 1-Commodity prices top risk to German econ-DIHK," * Manufacturers most worried by commodity prices - DIHK
 * Currency manipulation must be taken seriously - DIHK
 * Commodities prices hovering at two-year highs

(Adds commodities price index)
 By Gernot Heller
 BERLIN, Oct 26 (Reuters) - German firms are increasingly
worried about the rising cost of raw materials and energy, which
pose the biggest risk to the economy, the head of the country's
chamber of industry and commerce (DIHK) said on Tuesday.
 ""Rising energy and raw materials prices are the biggest
economic risk for companies,"" DIHK President Hans Heinrich
Driftmann told Reuters in an interview.
 Driftmann also said leading economies must avoid keeping
their currencies weak to give their firms a competitive edge in
international markets, even if German firms can cope with the
currently strong euro.
 Raw materials costs have been rising as countries worldwide
race to lock in supplies of resources, with rapidly growing
China in particular striking huge investment deals in Africa
this year while also benefiting from its own weak currency.
 According to the DIHK, some 44 percent of German firms saw
rising costs as the biggest risk to their business, though among
manufacturers the number rose to 66 percent, Driftmann said.
 ""It's not just the big increase in prices that are a
problem, a lot of companies are worried about having their
access to raw materials cut off,"" he said.
 ""In view of this, it's imperative we reach European -- or
better yet -- international agreements on raw materials with
fair rules for all export and import countries,"" he added.
 Germany, which depends on supply of raw materials from
abroad to power its export-driven economy, is staging a major
congress to address the issue on Tuesday.
 The 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a key
benchmark for commodities prices, has been hovering at two-year
highs this month.
 German Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle criticised China
while on a trip there this month for restricting supplies of raw
materials, access to which in Africa has also been at the centre
of a tug-of-war between western powers and China.
 China's trade with Africa is expected to top $100 billion in
2010, a huge leap from $91.1 billion in 2009, according to
China's Ministry of Commerce.
 Driftmann also lent his voice to the chorus of German
policymakers insisting that leading economies must avoid keeping
their currencies weak.
 ""Even if our exporters can cope well with the stronger euro,
we can't take lightly attempts by countries to obtain a
short-term advantage with a weak currency,"" he said.
 Still, Driftmann said the strength of the German economic
upswing, which has surprised many analysts, meant that Europe's
largest economy could recover the ground lost in last year's
recession and get output back to pre-crisis levels as soon as
2011.
 The pick-up -- which this month prompted a group of leading
think tanks to forecast the German economy would grow some 3.5
percent this year -- should be used as a springboard for reform
of local authorities' finances, Driftmann said.
 ""We also need to get a real tax reform started that
simplifies the system and brings relief, focusing especially on
corporate tax and on small and medium-sized firms,"" he said.

 By Wendell Roelf and Stella Mapenzauswa
 CAPE TOWN, Oct 26 (Reuters) - South Africa said on Tuesday
that it would weaken its rand currency to boost economic growth,
threatening a deal to refrain from competitive devaluations
reached by the Group of 20 major nations just three days ago.
 The statement by South African presidency minister Collins
Chabane appeared to mark a policy shift by President Jacob
Zuma's government, which previously had resisted calls by labour
unions to stimulate exports by weakening the rand .
 Chabane, describing a new long-term growth plan for South
Africa, said it ""entails a careful balancing of more active
monetary policy interventions to achieve growth...through a more
competitive exchange rate and a lower cost of capital.""
 The plan sees unemployment falling to 15 percent from 25.3
percent currently over the next 10 years, implying the creation
of 5 million jobs during that period, the government said.
 At a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bankers in
South Korea last weekend, countries pledged to ""refrain from
competitive devaluations"" of their currencies. As a G20 member,
South Africa was party to the agreement. [ID:nTOE69M004]
 A South African government spokesman insisted on Tuesday
that there was no contradiction between his country's plan and
the G20 pledge, which was designed to reduce the risk of a
global trade war.
 ""We don't see our growth path in conflict with G20 pledges,""
Themba Maseko told Reuters.
 But analysts said South Africa's plan could herald more
aggressive use of both a weaker currency and low interest rates
over coming years in an effort to tackle unemployment, which
Zuma's government has identified as its biggest challenge. (for

 Tuesday's statement suggested ""another change of the
monetary policy committee's (MPC) mandate is on the way, plus
more forex policy change"", said Peter Attard Montalto, emerging
markets economist at Nomura International in London.
 ""I think this is a push for more activist policy on both
currency and MPC, involving new interventions and a shift of the
MPC mandate to explicit growth targeting over time.""
 
 BUDGET REVIEW
 Chabane did not elaborate on Tuesday on how South Africa
would conduct its ""monetary policy interventions"", or say how
much it wanted to weaken its currency.
 ""The minister of finance will make further pronouncements on
the growth plan and possible currency foreign exchange plans on
Wednesday,"" Maseko said.
 Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, who has himself spoken out
in the past against efforts by countries to weaken their
currencies, will deliver his medium-term budget review on
Wednesday. [ID:nLDE69I0YK]
 The rand has appreciated about 27 percent against the U.S.
dollar since the start of 2009, buoyed by a flood of investor
funds from sluggish developed economies into emerging markets.
 Many analysts said the country would have difficulty
fighting this trend. South Africa has relatively low foreign
exchange reserves and relies on foreign capital inflows to plug
its current account deficit, so it cannot easily copy countries
such as China and Brazil, which have used forex interventions
and taxes on capital flows to steer their currencies.
 ""South Africa is but a very small boat on a very rough sea
in the currency war arena. It is beyond its capacity to steer
the exchange rate of the rand directly,"" said Jac Laubscher,
group economist at finance house Sanlam.
 ""Its only hope is to use its position in the G20 to promote
a multilateral response to the need for currency realignment...
Apart from that, any country that runs a perpetual current
account deficit can hardly afford to discourage capital
inflows.""
 
 CENTRAL BANK
 Also, it is not clear if South Africa's central bank, which
is independent of the government, would go along with any plan
to weaken the rand. It might be reluctant to undertake any major
campaign of currency intervention; in September it said it was
accumulating foreign reserves but that the process was ""costly"".
 Similarly, it might resist the idea of cutting interest
rates to weaken the rand as its core mandate is to protect price
stability. Gordhan wrote to Reserve Bank Governor Gill Marcus in
February saying the MPC must also take into account economic
growth and job creation in rate decisions, but it is unclear if
the government would go as far as formally changing the mandate.
 For those reasons, some analysts said the talk of currency
depreciation might largely aim at satisfying the labour unions,
rather than being a firm commitment to a much weaker rand.
 The new plan ""is much more focused on employment creation
and domestic growth generation than necessarily the currency"",
said Leon Myburgh, sub-Saharan Africa specialist at Citi.
 ""It's a very broad intention and the rand is just a subset
of that. It's being viewed as a tool to get to an end objective,
which is ultimately employment growth. I wouldn't overstate the
role of the rand within the broader statement.""
 The rand did not move significantly against the dollar in
response to Chabane's statement on Tuesday, reflecting doubts
about authorities' ability to weaken the currency any time soon.
 ""It's more long-term, decades type of stuff -- he has made
long-term comments. The budget announcements will probably have
much more direct effect on markets,"" said Ion de Vleeschauwer,
chief dealer at Bidvest Bank.

 * Stocks weak, Wall Street set for losses
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Second thoughts about the outcome
of the next Federal Reserve meeting weakened stocks and steadied
the dollar's decline on Tuesday, underlining how crucial the
prospect of more Fed asset-buying has become to financial
markets.
 Wall Street looked set to open lower.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index was down a third of a
percent with its emerging market sub-index sustaining a small
loss.
 The dollar was up nearly 0.2 percent against a basket of
major currencies.
 After no major policy initiatives emerged from the Group of
20 finance ministers' meeting over the weekend, investors had
renewed selling the dollar, expecting it to fall with the advent
of more quantitative easing (QE) from the Fed.
 QE essentially involves printing more money, so a flood of
dollars on the market would debase the currency's value.
 But some investors have begun worrying that the market
consensus for a big burst of QE may be overdone. This has been
backed up by comments from some Fed officials.
 Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenig called more asset
buys by the central bank a ""very dangerous gamble"". New York Fed
President William Dudley said the U.S. economic context would
determine whether an incremental or big bang approach to asset
purchases was better.
 ""The dollar is in a bit of a holding pattern. The market is
still mulling over the U.S. QE story and dollar selling is a bit
less of a one-way bet than it was,"" said Jeremy Stretch,
currency strategist at CIBC.
 The dollar also rose around 0.4 percent against the yen to
81.09 yen after Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said
Japan would take decisive steps on the exchange rate when
needed, a not-too-subtle reminder about intervention.
 The euro lost a quarter of a percent to fall below $1.40.
 Meanwhile, the prospect of more QE from the Bank of England
was also called into question by data showing the UK economy
grew 0.8 percent in the third quarter, bringing year-on-year
growth to 2.8 percent -- the fastest annual rate in three years.
 
 HEADWINDS FOR STOCKS
 European equities fell on both uncertainty about QE and
comments from ArcelorMittal that the basic resources sector
faced extended weakness.
 ""We had a rally since August and now people are waiting to
see whether this quantitative easing is going to come through or
not. There are still some uncertainties and the market is going
to be range-bound until the meeting of the Fed,"" said Koen De
Leus, strategist at KBC Securities, in Brussels.
 The Fed meets next on Nov. 2-3.
 ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker, predicted a
far weaker-than-expected fourth quarter due to muted demand,
lower prices and higher raw material costs.
 The overall result was to drag the FTSEurofirst 300 down 0.4
percent.
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei closed down 0.3 percent, with
exporters still in focus because of the strong yen.
 U.S. stock index futures pointed to a lower open on Wall
Street with Texas Instruments Inc in focus after it warned,
despite expectation-beating earnings, that its fourth-quarter
revenue will be hurt by slowing demand for chips for computers
and televisions.

 * EU monitoring situation
 * WTO's Lamy says global trade agreement needed

(Updates with new quotes)
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BERLIN, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The World Trade Organisation and
the EU said on Tuesday they were seeking a solution to German
concerns about reported Chinese restrictions on exports of rare
earths used to make many high-tech products.
 At a conference in Berlin, where the German government
warned of the severe impact of the scarcity of the 17 minerals
with magnetic, luminescent and other properties, the EU said it
was watching China's actions for possible legal implications.
 Frank Hoffmeister, a top aide of European trade chief Karel
De Gucht, was asked at the seminar whether the EU planned legal
action against China over the reported export restrictions.
 ""It is clear we are monitoring the situation quite closely.
We need to have clear facts,"" he answered.
 The EU called on the Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development to draw up rules securing raw materials trade.
 ""The OECD has proved to be an effective forum in which to
explore and potentially enlarge pluri-lateral disciplines in the
raw materials field,"" said Hoffmeister.
 ""Raw materials have become a geopolitical issue,"" German
industry federation chief Hans-Peter Keitel said. ""We need to
integrate ourselves into an international raw materials policy.""
 The head of the WTO, Pascal Lamy, prescribed a completion of
stalled global trade talks as a way of eliminating uncertainty
about access to scarce raw materials.
 Lamy said the Doha round -- deadlocked since 2008 -- would
set clear rules on the transport, sustainable exploitation and
tariffs of raw materials, and avert global political tensions.
 ""A completion of the Doha Round will serve as a stepping
stone towards better international trade rules in resource
sectors,"" Lamy told the conference.
 Germany's electronics industry has said the market for rare
earths, used to manufacture a range of high-tech products, had
become ""critical"" due to reported restrictions on exports from
China, which produces 97 percent of the world's supply.
 The country's dominance of rare earths used in high-tech
products has drawn growing international attention after reports
that the government has been choking off shipments, possibly for
political reasons.

 ECONOMIC, SECURITY CONCERNS
 Beijing has denied any plans to cut export quotas of the
minerals used to make cars, computers, cell phones and other
high-technology products. Washington has called it a potential
threat to the U.S. economy and national security.
 China's media has accused Western countries of making
unreasonable demands over the cheap supply of rare earths.
 German Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle said his country
was ""severely affected when it comes to energy resources and ...
rare earths which are growing scarce"".
 ""When speculation is rife, you lose the foundation in the
economy,"" he said. ""And that is detrimental for the producing
industries. Pricing frameworks must remain on our agenda.""
 Germany, which depends on raw materials from abroad to power
its export-driven economy, this month announced a government
strategy to secure access to crucial raw materials and called on
countries to address the issue together at international talks.
 German companies such as ThyssenKrupp said action was needed
to secure scarce resources in China, Central Asia and Africa.
 ""We do not have time to discuss endlessly what to do, we
have to act now,"" said Edwin Eichler, head of ThyssenKrupp Steel
Europe, adding it is time to enter Russian and Central Asian
markets. ""We have to go there, we have to bring our knowledge,
and maybe we will find some new resources there.""
 Chinese representatives were not present on any of the panel
discussions in Berlin, though the hosts said an official from
the Chinese embassy had been invited.
 Turning to efforts to address trade imbalances, Bruederle
said Berlin was ready for a ""frank dialogue"" with the United
States, but he rebuffed a proposal by U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner for a 4 percent limit on trade imbalances.

 By Christina Fincher and David Milliken
 LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Britain's economy grew twice as
fast as expected in the third quarter and ratings agency
Standard and Poor's lifted the threat of a credit downgrade, a
boost for a government under fire over steep spending cuts.
 But the risk of a sharp slowdown in the first half of 2011
remains, with strong headwinds likely to come from tax rises, a
patchy recovery in Britain's main trading partners and cuts
which may cost half a million jobs in the public sector.
 The Office for National Statistics said Britain's economy
grew 0.8 percent between July and September, down from a
nine-year high of 1.2 percent in the second quarter but twice
the 0.4 percent most economists had expected.
 Sterling jumped and gilts hit a one-month low as investors
reckoned the combination of above-trend growth and above-target
inflation meant the Bank of England would struggle to justify an
expansion of its ""quantitative easing"" to support the economy.

Graphic: http://r.reuters.com/nag32q
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Speculation Britain's central bank might pump more money
into the economy gathered pace this month after one policymaker,
Adam Posen, broke ranks to vote for additional easing. However,
Andrew Sentance, the committee's most hawkish member, lost no
time in reiterating his belief that interest rates should now
start to rise -- albeit gradually.
 Economists said the data was likely to make the BoE keep
policy unchanged for longer.
 ""For the Bank of England, the GDP strength probably
minimises for the time being the risk of others joining Adam
Posen in voting for another round of QE,"" said George Buckley at
Deutsche Bank.
 
 GOVERNMENT PLEASED
 In annual terms, Britain's economy grew by 2.8 percent in
the third quarter, the fastest rate in three years and up from
1.7 percent in the previous quarter. The BoE had forecast growth
of around 2.4 percent in August.
 Less than two hours after the data, ratings agency S&P
raised the outlook on Britain's triple-A rating to ""stable"" from
""negative"", citing the government's commitment to see through
its ambitious austerity programme.
 British finance minister George Osborne described the GDP
reading and the move from S&P as ""a big vote of confidence in
the UK and a vote of confidence in the coalition's economic
policies.""
Taking both the second and third quarters together, Britain
enjoyed its strongest six-month growth spurt since the first
half of 2000.
 However, this momentum is not expected to last. Cuts to
public-sector jobs and spending start in earnest next year, and
a rise in value-added tax and reductions in some benefits will
take money out of consumers' pockets.
 Tight credit from banks adds to the difficulties the private
sector will face in replacing public sector activity.
 ""The government will no doubt take this as a sign that the
private sector can fill the gap created by public sector cuts,
but with consumer confidence, hiring intentions surveys and
housing activity data all softening we remain cautious,"" said
James Knightley, an economist at Dutch bank ING.
 
 CONSTRUCTION BOOST TO FADE
 A quarter of Britain's third-quarter expansion was due to
construction, enjoying a second quarter of strong growth
following disruption from an unusually icy winter. Construction
output expanded by 4.0 percent on the quarter and 11.0 percent
on the year, its best annual performance since 1988.
 Commentators were united, however, in expecting the boost to
be short-lived. Public works contracts have been one of the
first casualties of Britain's austerity drive and house prices
have weakened markedly over the summer, denting housebuilders'
enthusiam for new projects.
 ""Looking ahead, with the cuts already set out in the
comprehensive spending review, contractors face a difficult
period ahead and optimism in the civil engineering sector is not
high for 2011,"" said the Civil Engineering Contractors'
Association's head of industry affairs, Alasdair Reisner.
 Services growth held steady at 0.6 percent on the quarter
but industrial output growth slowed to 0.6 percent from 1.0
percent in the previous quarter.
 The EEF, which represents manufacturers, said Britain's
recovery appeared steadier than that after past recessions, but
that future growth could not be guaranteed.
 ""Below the headline number we are still only seeing
tentative signs of the economic rebalancing the UK needs,"" said
EEF senior economist Jeegar Kakkad. ""The rising risk of a
currency war, coupled with cautious consumers at home, could
still derail recovery.""

government spending cuts bite, value-added tax rises and the

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The dollar gained against the
yen, holding above its 1995 record low on Tuesday following
reminders from Japanese officials about the possibility of more
steps to curb yen strength.
 The U.S. currency steadied against other currencies, with
the euro stuck below $1.40 as market participants pondered how
much monetary easing the Federal Reserve would opt for and how
much may be priced in to an already weak U.S. currency.
 Helping steady the dollar were comments by New York Fed
President William Dudley overnight, who said the economic
context would determine whether an incremental or big bang
approach to asset purchases was better.
 The market was also wary about pushing the dollar lower
versus the yen due to worries about possible intervention after
Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said Japan would take
decisive steps on forex when needed.
 At 0746 GMT, the dollar was up 0.5 percent at 81.15 yen,
with traders citing talk of Japanese investors buying to take it
above reported stop losses at 80.90 and 81.05 yen.
 The dollar's record low of 79.75 yen has become a focal
point. It hit a 15-year trough at 80.41 yen on Monday, with
players wary Japan may intervene if it nears 80.00.
 ""There has been some verbal intervention to stem the advance
of the yen, but it's a case of when not if we get a squeeze back
down towards the 80 (yen) area,"" said Jeremy Stretch, currency
strategist at CIBC.
 ""The dollar is in a bit of a holding pattern. The market is
still mulling over the U.S. QE (quantitative easing) story and
dollar selling is a bit less of a one-way bet than it was.""
 The Bank of Japan, which acts on behalf of the Ministry of
Finance, intervened on Sep. 15 for the first time since 2004 to
sell the yen. The greenback has fallen broadly since then as the
market has priced in more Federal Reserve quantitative easing.
 ""Everyone thinks intervention is a possibility, that it is
an option, but it is hard to say at what level that could
occur,"" said a trader for a foreign bank in Tokyo.
 
 DOLLAR STEADY
 The euro dipped 0.1 percent to $1.3945 after failing to
close above $1.4000 on Monday and keeping intact a familiar
range roughly between $1.3700 and $1.4160 this month.
 The euro has support at around 1.3860, its low last Friday
and its 21-day moving average at $1.3866.
 The dollar was up 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies
at 77.287. The index has support at 76.00-10 area, just below
its Oct. 15 low of 76.144 while resistance is seen at 78.40.
 Elsewhere, the Swedish crown eased to 9.2530 crowns per euro
from around 9.17 after Sweden's central bank raised rates by 25
basis points as expected, but scaled down its expectations for
future policy tightening.
 Macro funds had trimmed some of their short dollar positions
as they waited to see how the G20 currency debate shaped up,
with a question mark after the weekend statement as to whether
major currencies such as the euro should adjust upwards as much
against the dollar as Asian currencies.
 Tensions among G20 partners have muddied the waters for
Japan, which is worried yen strength is harming its fragile
economy but pledged with its G20 counterparts at the weekend to
refrain from competitive currency devaluations.

 By Mia Shanley and Johan Sennero
 STOCKHOLM, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Sweden's central bank raised
interest rates as forecast on Tuesday but said growth concerns
abroad meant future hikes could be more gradual than thought,
reflecting divisions between policymakers and wrongfooting some
analysts.
 The 25 basis point increase in the repo rate to 1.0 percent
was expected by 18 of 20 analysts polled by Reuters. Two
analysts had seen no hike until December.
 But the slower tightening path -- which came in spite of
raised growth forecasts for Sweden's economy for this year and
next -- drove the Swedish crown and debt yields lower. 
 The local currency has received a boost this year as Sweden
became the only EU nation raising its main policy rates.
 ""The Swedish economy is growing quickly. It is also true
that it will continue to grow rapidly and we ...see a stronger
economic development in Sweden than in the U.S., euro-area,""
Governor Stefan Ingves told a news conference.
 The central bank said in a statement the repo rate needed to
be gradually raised in order to stabilise inflation close to the
target of 2 percent and attain normal resource utilisation.
 But weak developments overseas meant the rate did not need
to rise as rapidly in coming years as it had previously
anticipated.
 ""It is above all the global development, not least when it
comes to rates,"" Ingves said.
 Analysts said the reduced rate path was the main surprise in
the announcement, though forward market rates had already been
below the central bank's forecasts.
 ""This is a big step in a more dovish path for the Riksbank,""
said Elisabet Kopelman, an analyst at SEB.
 ""They are concerned about the development in the rest of the
world and they have absorbed the signals from other central
banks, which means that they will be more cautious in raising
the repo rate further on.""
 Difference of opinion on the central bank's board
contributed to the dovish message: one deputy governor who had
earlier only advocated a lower rate path joined another in
objecting to the latest rate rise.
 SEB's Kopelman said, however, that the market is still
pricing fewer hikes than the Riksbank.
 ""There is still a gap between the market and the Riksbank,""
she said. ""The market believes the rate path will continue up to
somewhere around 2.25 percent ...The Riksbank's new rate path
shows they will peak at 3.50.""

 STRONG RECOVERY
 After a contraction of around 5 percent in 2009 -- the
steepest drop since World War Two -- Sweden has gradually raised
rates from record lows in tandem with a brisk economic recovery.
 The country's strong public finances stand in sharp contrast
to many other parts of Europe, which are struggling to rein in
bloated deficits and implement brutal spending cuts.
 Domestic demand has been strong and house prices have
continued to rise, and the Riksbank said it did not want
imbalances to emerge in the economy.
 Exporters such as telecoms giant Ericsson and Volvo, the
world's second-biggest truck maker, have been rolling out robust
quarterly figures.
 Referring to key export markets, the central bank said the
U.S. recovery would take time and that fiscal policy tightening
measures were dampening growth in Europe.
 This was leading to moderate inflationary pressures in an
environment of low international interest rates.
 The central bank therefore forecast an average quarterly
repo rate of 2 percent at the end of 2011 rather than a previous
2.4 percent and saw rates on average at 2.9 percent by the end
of 2012 rather than 3.3 percent.
 ""They obviously focused more on the low inflation and the
strengthening of the crown also played a part,"" said Knut
Hallberg, an analyst at Swedbank.
 By 1032 GMT, the crown was down to about 9.28 to the euro
from 9.17 prior to the rate decision, while spreads against
German debt tightened.

 Riksbank Deputy Governors Karolina Ekholm and Lars Svensson
both entered reservations against the rate hike and the
projected rate path.
 They wanted a gradual rise in rates to 2.7 percent by the
end of 2013, against the Riksbank's 3.4 percent outlook.
 Despite its message of softer rates, the central bank raised
its growth forecast for Sweden to 4.8 percent this year from 4.1
percent and to 3.8 percent from 3.5 percent for 2011. It cut its
2012 forecast to 2.5 percent from 2.6 percent.

 * Says China wants dialogue on intellectual property
 (Adds quotes and background)
 BEIJING, Oct 26 (Reuters) - China's trade surplus this year
will definitely be smaller than last year because of rising
imports, Vice Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said on Tuesday.
 A narrower Chinese trade surplus is seen as a key component
of the rebalancing that is needed to put the global economy on
sounder footing, and officials in Beijing will also point to it
as evidence that the yuan is not as undervalued as critics say.
 ""Although our exports will grow this year, the trade surplus
will be definitely smaller than last year,"" he told Reuters on
Tuesday on the sidelines of a seminar.
 China's trade surplus was $196 billion in 2009. The rolling
12-month surplus was down to $181 billion through September.
 The surplus shrank dramatically at the start of this year,
with the country even running its first monthly deficit in March
in six years, but has rebounded in recent months.
 Zhong also called for the establishment of a dialogue
mechanism between China and the United States to deal with trade
frictions related to intellectual property rights.
 ""Chinese enterprises in recent years have become a major
target of the investigations made by the United States under
Section 337. In particular, this has been difficult for firms,""
Zhong said at a seminar with delegates from the International
Trade Commission.

 NEW DELHI, Oct 26 (Reuters) - When U.S. President Barack
Obama arrives in India next month, he will face a key challenge
of boosting defence ties that are on the upswing but mired by
political suspicion over pandering to Washington's interests.
 Underlying the visit will be lobbying for billions of
dollars in contracts to overhaul India's mostly
Russian-supplied military, a relic of their Cold War era
partnership.
 Those orders include a $11 billion deal for 126 fighter
jets that could benefit U.S.' Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp.
France's Dassault, Russia's MiG-35, Sweden's Saab and the
Eurofighter Typhoon are also competing.
 But Washington faces a host of hurdles, including Indian
worries that signing defence pacts which are necessary for the
U.S. arms sales to go through may land New Delhi into a wider
entanglement with the U.S. military.
 While Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has reached out to
Washington over his last six years in powers, many within his
own Congress party as well as his parliamentary allies are
reluctant to embrace these pacts, pending over three years.
 ""India is weighing to see if all these agreements are to
give a wider room to manoeuvre for U.S. forces in the region,""
said Siddharth Varadarajan, strategic affairs editor at Hindu

""There is a mismatch in expectations from the relationship.
India wants weapons sales as a transactional relationship, the
U.S. is seeking exclusivity in partnership,"" he said, referring
to any U.S. desire to make the Indian military an active
element in its strategic expansion in the region.
 A KPMG report this month said the misgivings over the pacts
were ""roadblocks"" in sustaining the momentum in the
relationship.
 Obama's challenge is not as much in winning contracts as it
is in lifting ties to a long-term military partnership in a
region where Washington is now fighting a war and seeking ways
to contain China's rise.
 And the defence pacts Washington wants India to sign
underscore some of those challenges.
 One pact is the Logistics Support Agreement (LSA), which
would allow American military to use Indian facilities for
operations like refueling. Indians fear India could be used as
a launching pad for military operations in the region.
 Two other pacts are required under US domestic laws to
transfer sensitive defence technology. India fears the military
will have to share communications secrets with the United
States.
 ""These agreements need wider consultation. They have
various implications,"" an Indian defence ministry official told
Reuters.
 DEVELOPING TIES
 Once on the opposite sides of the Cold War, India and the
United States began warming up to each other about a decade
back, the paradigm shift coming with a 2008 civil nuclear deal
that then President Bush pushed to end India's nuclear
isolation.
 And the growing convergence in defence ties is manifest in
India agreeing to buy U.S. military hardware worth some $10
billion in government-to-government sales in the past two
years.
 The United States has held more military exercises with
India than any other country. Two-way trade has risen to close
to $50 billion from just $5 billion in 1990.
 Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was also the first
state guest of the Obama administration last year.
 But what India is looking for is reassurance that
Washington takes New Delhi seriously as a global partner and
will not sacrifice Indian interests as it seeks to bolster
rival Pakistan to combat Islamist militants, and deals with
China.
 This may help explain India's reluctance to go into a bear
hug with U.S. military at the risk of alienating its
time-tested ally Russia, and other European powers such as
Britain and France which are trying to boost ties, including
military, with India.
 ""India and the U.S. need to work out how the relationship
has shifted,"" said Evan Feigenbaum, a South Asia expert at
Washington-based think tank Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).
 ""Security is not just about procurement and contracts, it
needs to reflect the new nature of the relationship.""
 Indian confidence could be boosted if Obama declares his
support for a permanent seat for India on the U.N. Security
Council and further eases U.S. export controls on dual-use
technologies that have both conventional and nuclear use.
 ""It's not an either-or situation. The maturation of
US-India defence ties is steady and is well rounded in most
respects,"" said James Clad, former U.S. deputy assistant
secretary of defence for Asia and now with Pentagon's National
Defence University.
 There are other irritants in the relationship, including
problems over India's nuclear liability regime, a sector
holding big plumbs for U.S.' Walmart., General Electric and
Westinghouse Electric, subsidiary of Toshiba Corp.

1285,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2010 03:56AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Germany enlists markets to enforce EU budget rules," * Sanctions for rule-breakers would not be automatic
 * But crisis mechanism would admit possibility of default
 * Bond spreads would therefore pressure governments
 * Unclear if EU treaty can be revised
 
 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Reforms to European Union
budget rules are being criticised for giving politicians too
much leeway in enforcing the rules. But a German proposal means
bond markets may ultimately become the main enforcer, imposing
the toughest discipline that countries have seen so far.
 Under draft reforms agreed by EU finance ministers last
week, punitive sanctions on states that spent too freely would
not be automatic; any decision by ministers to move forward with
sanctions could be halted by a blocking minority.[ID:nLDE69I1FB]
 Germany, which had been advocating near-automatic sanctions,
yielded to French demands for more political discretion in the
process. As a result, the reforms were roundly criticised by
some northern European governments and by the European Central
Bank for being too soft. [ID:nLDE69I0VK]
 But in exchange for its concession, Germany secured the
backing of France to change the European Union treaty, the
27-nation bloc's main law, to allow the creation of a permanent
mechanism to resolve economic and debt crises.
 Although this aspect was not publicly stressed by Berlin and
Paris, such a mechanism would involve the possibility that a
euro zone country would not pay back its creditors in full,
sources among senior euro zone officials told Reuters.
 Because of this possibility, investors would demand higher
premiums to lend money to euro zone governments that appeared in
danger of overspending.
 That could create a strong incentive for governments to obey
the EU's fiscal rules -- a stronger incentive than they have
faced under the current system, which does not spell out the
possibility of a country partially defaulting on its debt.
 ""Instead of the politicians, it would be the markets
punishing a country because they would know the euro zone would
not necessarily come to its rescue,"" said Barbara Bottcher, head
of European policy research at Deutsche Bank.
 ""This would be much more efficient than the political
procedure.""
 
 FUTURE OF EURO ZONE
 This year's debt crises suggest enforcement of the EU's
budget rules, which say governments' budget deficits should not
exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product while public debt
must not stay above 60 percent of GDP, may be key to the
long-term cohesion of the euro zone.
 Under the draft reforms, new sanctions would be introduced
for governments which did not try to bring their budgets close
to balance or into surplus. Countries would be punished for
tolerating, despite EU warnings, macroeconomic imbalances such
as real estate bubbles or large current account imbalances.
 EU leaders are expected to approve the draft changes at a
summit late this week, after which governments will try to
hammer out an agreement on numerical details such as the size of
fines for rule-breakers and the speed at which countries will be
required to adjust excessive deficits. The process is likely to
take at least several months.
 Some investors view Germany's climb-down on automatic
sanctions last week as a potentially fatal flaw in the EU's
reforms.
 Enforcement of the rules ""is a weakness, and as long as
there is a weakness financial markets could focus on it and try
to take advantage of it,"" said Nick Kounis, chief European
economist at ABN Amro.
 ""The compromise means that politicians are in the end
masters of their own fate; that was exactly the problem with the
institutional framework before...
 ""Where we are now is not too far from where we were before.
This new mechanism gives politicians a chance to interfere and
get themselves off the hook -- that is the risk.""

 MARKET DISCIPLINE
 Others, however, think Germany's approach to the reforms
will make life much harder for spendthrift governments.
 In the decade after the launch of the euro in 1999, there
was no provision for a country to default on its debt, so the
markets assumed countries breaking the budget rules would
eventually be bailed out if necessary by their richer peers.
 This let profligate countries keep borrowing at ultra-low
rates, giving them little incentive to tighten their belts.
Fines threatened by the EU were never imposed, and in any case
would likely have been too small to force compliance; larger
fines would simply have worsened countries' financial plight.
 To avoid a regional crisis, Germany was ultimately forced to
take part in a 110 billion euro bailout of Greece and help
establish a 750 billion euro temporary safety net for other
indebted euro zone countries.
 Now, by revising the EU treaty to create a permanent
mechanism in which countries could undergo an ""orderly
insolvency"", Germany would be ensuring that future crises might
be handled without bailouts.
 This prospect would keep bond spreads high for fiscally
irresponsible governments, putting them under pressure to mend
their ways. In effect, Germany would be bringing in the bond
markets as the top enforcer of fiscal discipline.
 ""In the past ten years the market process for punishing
government profligacy has not worked -- the question is why?""
said Elga Bartsch, European economist at Morgan Stanley.
 ""Is it because markets have always known that countries
would be bailed out? If (a default mechanism) would give markets
more ammunition to exercise their function, it might actually be
a breakthrough.""
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble appeared to have
exactly this logic in mind when he told the Bild am Sonntag
newspaper at the weekend that holders of government bonds should
""take on responsibility"" during any future sovereign debt crisis
in the euro zone. [ID:nLDE69N03W]
 
 TREATY
 Germany's approach carries risks. Even a partial default by
any country would risk destabilising the entire euro zone.
 Also, any revisions to the EU treaty would need to be
ratified by all the EU's 27 members -- a very difficult, complex
and time-consuming process that many euro zone policymakers
believe could fail. [ID:nLDE69O1TQ] 
 But Germany seems to be calculating that these risks are
acceptable when set against the dangers of remaining on the hook
for future bailouts.
 And even if Germany fails to secure the treaty revision, it
has succeeded in signalling that it will not necessarily stump
up money for any future euro zone bailout. This in itself could
keep bond spreads high, partly achieving the purpose of an
orderly insolvency mechanism.
 ""It is a puzzle with different elements and even though each
element might not be the optimal version, when they all come
together, it is a major upgrade of the governance structure of
the monetary union,"" said Deutsche Bank's Bottcher.

* T4-1 and T8-1 abandoned, $185 million costs written off
(Repeats to reach more customers)
 LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Oil explorer Cairn Energy said
one of its wells in Greenland did not result in a commercial
discovery and another failed to reach target depth before the
end of the Arctic drilling season.
 Cairn said on Tuesday that the Alpha-1S1 well in Baffin Bay,
a well which it said in September had found evidence of oil, did
not reach the Mesozoic geological depth it was aiming for and as
such was suspended.
 Another well, T4-1, did not find significant hydrocarbons
and was plugged and abandoned -- the same result as the third
well of its three-well exploration programme this summer.
 Cairn said it could return to the Alpha well at some point
in the future to deepen it or drill a sidetrack well.
 Protesters from environmental group Greenpeace, who object
to oil exploration in the pristine Arctic territory where they
say an oil leak would be difficult to cap, in August tried to
stall the drilling of the Alpha well by suspending themselves
from the rig.
 Costs of $185 million from the two plugged and abandoned
wells are forecast to be written off in accordance with Cairn's
accounting policies, the company said.
 Greenland, a self-governing territory of Denmark, is one of
the world's largest under-explored frontier areas, according to
consultancy Wood Mackenzie, which estimated there could be over
20 billion barrels of oil equivalent in the country.

(Adds press conference comments, updates share price)
 By Agnieszka Barteczko and Adrian Krajewski
 WARSAW, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Eastern Europe's top listed
broadcaster TVN expects a cooler final three months of the year
after a recovering advertising market and lower finance costs
lifted third-quarter net profit by a surprise 5 percent.
 TVN shares reversed earlier gains to trade just over 1
percent down at 1124 GMT as the Polish broadcaster's Chief
Executive Markus Tellenbach said he expected advertising market
growth to be slower than it was in the last two quarters.
 ""We believe that the bullish recovery (for the ad market) in
the second and third quarter won't be continued in the fourth
quarter,"" Tellenbach told a news conference.
 ""Cooling off doesn't mean a negative trend but a pace slower
than in the second and third quarter. For the whole year we
still expect the market to show growth at lower single-digit
pace.""
 The group expects revenue growth in the last three months of
the year to be around 15 percent, in line with the first three
quarters on a comparable basis, after the top line grew by a
fourth to 534 million zlotys ($190 million).
 TVN, which also controls Poland's top portal Onet.pl and
pay-TV platform 'n', also expects a 2010 EBITDA (earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margin of close to
the 24.4 percent achieved in the first nine months.
 ""Their cautiousness runs against positive third-quarter
results,"" Raifeisen analyst Dominik Niszcz said. ""Maybe one
should wait until next year for more positive advertising market
trends.""
 Third-quarter net profit rose 5 percent to 61 million
zlotys, far exceeding market expectations of a 40 percent fall,
on lower than expected financial costs relating to the group's
euro-denominated debt.
 TVN took heart from the TV advertising market's 10 percent
rise in the July-September period, with revenue from the online
segment and the 'n' platform adding steam.
 Analysts expect 'n' to be a drag in the last quarter of the
year after two straight quarters of positive EBITDA, as pay-TV
platforms use the holiday season to lure new customers with
hefty discounts.
 In order to support 'n', expected to start showing positive
cash-flow next year, TVN has signed a long-term cooperation deal
with Poland's top telecom TPSA to add broadband Internet to the
platform's offer.

 By Charlotte Cooper and Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The dollar held just a yen above
its 1995 record low against the Japanese currency on Tuesday,
prompting Japanese policy-makers to remind the market that Tokyo
might intervene if pushed to stop its currency from rising.
 The dollar eased against a basket of currencies but was
firmer on the euro after the single currency failed to sustain
gains the previous day back towards a recent eight-month high,
highlighting the fact that the greenback is finding bouts of
support.
 The dollar's postwar record low of 79.75 yen set in April
1995 has become a focal point as the greenback has moved steadily
lower, hitting a 15-year trough at 80.41 yen on Monday, with
players wary that Japan may intervene if it nears 80.00 yen,
following Tokyo's first intervention in six years in September.
 But tensions among G20 partners over competitive currency
devaluations have muddied the waters for Japan, which is worried
yen strength is harming its fragile economy but pledged along
with its G20 counterparts at the weekend to refrain from
competitive devaluations.
 Still, the same pledge also said advanced economies would be
vigilant against disorderly exchange rate movements, a phrase
Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda was quick to point to on Tuesday
while saying Japan would take decisive steps on forex when
needed.
 ""Everyone thinks intervention is a possibility, that it is an
option, but it is hard to say at what level that could occur,""
said a trader for a foreign bank in Tokyo.
 The question was whether Japan had sufficient rationale to
intervene, given that falls in the dollar against the yen have
remained gradual and not been very rapid, he said.
 ""It could be pretty difficult to conduct intervention with
justification,"" he said.
 The dollar dipped as far as 80.66 yen on Tuesday before
edging back to stand slightly lower on the day at 80.79. It fell
0.2 percent against a basket of currencies.
 The Bank of Japan, which acts on behalf of the Ministry of
Finance, intervened on Sept.15 for the first time since 2004 to
sell the yen when it rose beyond 83.00 per dollar.
 The greenback has fallen broadly since then as the market has
priced in more quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve,
highlighting the uphill battle Japan would face if it did
intervene.
 Japanese exporters needing to convert their overseas earnings
are said to have sold dollars into even small dollar/yen rallies,
keeping the pair under downward pressure and prompting Nissan
Motor Co's chief operating officer to say on Tuesday he had a
""huge sense of crisis"" about the strong yen.
 Technically, chartists at JP Morgan said in a note that
dollar/yen was in a position for a test if not a break of the
1995 low. ""Still, given the short-term oversold set-up, a choppy
downside bias remains likely,"" they said.
 The euro eased 0.1 percent to $1.3947 after once again
failing to hold above $1.4000 on Monday and keeping intact a
familiar range roughly between $1.3700 and $1.4160 this month.
 ""It's tried a few times and failed. People are quick to
lock in profit these days,"" said Grant Turley, a strategist at
ANZ in Sydney.
 With the Fed expected to pump more money into the economy as
early as next week but with no clear consensus still on how much
cash it will inject, analysts expect dollar pairs to stay choppy.
 Keeping the market guessing, New York Fed President William
Dudley said whether an incremental or big bang approach to
asset purchases would work better depended on the economic
context.
 ""The market's getting mixed signals from the Fed but
ultimately whatever they do they are going to be doing QE2,"" said
a senior trader at a European bank in Hong Kong.
 The market had pared its expectations of massive purchases to
a more start-and-see-how-it-goes approach, he said, but in the
end QE was likely to continue until unemployment began to fall.
 Macro funds had trimmed some of their short dollar positions
as they waited to see how the G20 currency debate shaped up, with
a question mark after the weekend statement as to whether major
currencies such as the euro should adjust upwards as much against
the dollar as Asian currencies.
 ""That's a bit harder to gauge and if dollar/Asia starts
moving lower there's still going to be some intervention and
there's still going to be some of that recycled into the euro and
the Aussie,"" the senior trader said.
 The Australian dollar slipped 0.1 percent to $0.9900, still
unable to make a sustained push through parity.
 But it was seen supported by demand stemming from corporate
merger activities and heightened expectations of a near-term
interest rate hike, with markets awaiting consumer inflation on
Wednesday to see if the Reserve Bank of Australia will tighten.
 Markets are pricing in a 52 percent chance of a 25 basis
point rate hike to the 4.5 percent benchmark rate at the Nov. 2
meeting.

 HONG KONG, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose on
Wednesday on doubts that the Federal Reserve will aggressively
buy bonds to pump more money into the economy, triggering
profit taking in commodities and Asian equities.
 European stock markets followed Asia lower in early trade,
with the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of leading stocks
sliding 0.7 percent. S&P 500 futures  were down 0.7

 The Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday that the Federal

purchases worth ""a few hundred billion dollars"", but gave no
source for the report. [ID:nTOE69Q02H]
 Most currency dealers had expected a Fed policy meeting
next week to opt for more quantitative easing -- essentially
printing money to buy assets and pull market rates lower -- but
some believe the dollar already reflects those expectations and
the question of how much easing, and how fast, has kept them
edgy.

 In a Reuters survey earlier this month, U.S. primary
dealers' projections for the size of the Fed's expected
quantitative easing had ranged from $500 billion to $1.5
trillion. [FED/R]
 ""The market has had in mind a figure of $1 trillion or more
and we had been in a situation where that had led to dollar
weakness,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist Japan
for Barclays Capital. [ID:nTOE69Q041]
 Analysts at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch wrote in a client
note that the prevailing market belief was that QE was now
close to being fully priced in and anything short of $500
billion in announced purchases over a six-month horizon could
disappoint and cause interest rates to rise.
 A top concern of policymakers in Asia is that any
additional easing by the Fed will send more speculative ""hot
money"" into emerging economies, pushing up their currencies to
the point where exports are less competitive and threatening
regional economic growth.
 Singapore's central bank warned on Wednesday of the risk of
a disorderly reverse of such capital inflows if inflation was
not contained. Indian and South Korean officials also expressed
concerns about the impact of the recent flood of inflows.

 HONG KONG, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Asian stocks hovered near a
28-month high on Tuesday and the dollar steadied after a steep

 Major European stock markets opened a touch weaker, with

kept selling the dollar on expectations that further

 Expectations of more cheap money flooding the financial

 The dollar was largely unchanged at 80.71 yen , close

 Japan's finance minister Yoshihiko Noda said he was
watching the market ""with great interest"" and the government
would ""act decisively"" if needed -- language similar that used
by Tokyo in the build-up to last month's intervention.
[ID:nTOE69O09F]
 One trader said a fall in the dollar to below 79.75 yen
could be the catalyst for further intervention, but others said
Japan will probably wait for the outcome of the Fed's Nov. 2-3
meeting, before taking any action.
 A further decline in the dollar against the yen is likely
to meet support at 80.40 initially and then 80.15, although a
move further down to 79.75 is not expected in the near term.
 COMPETITIVE DEVALUATION
 Markets increasingly believe G20 signals against
competitive devaluation will make it tough for Tokyo to
intervene, and verbal warnings alone are unlikely to keep the
yen from breaking above record high.
 G20 finance ministers pledged at the weekend to move
towards market-determined exchange rates and commit to a
variety of policies to reduce excessive external imbalances.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan slipped
0.3 percent <.MIAPJ0000PUS> but remained close to a 28-month
high hit last week.
 Some analysts warned against chasing Asian stocks.
 ""While not yet expensive, Asia is trading at a premium to
the rest of the world on both a price to earnings basis and in
terms of price to book value,"" said Andrew Pease, chief
investment strategist, Asia Pacific, with Russell Investments
in Sydney.
 ""But with QE likely to support equity markets globally, now
is not the time to be underweight the region either,"" he
added.
 The MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan index is trading at 12.66
times estimates of earnings 12 months forward, only slight
below its 5-year average of 13.21 times, Thomson Reuters
I/B/E/S data showed.
 The MSCI's emerging market stocks benchmark index <.MSCIEF>
was up 0.13 percent at 0630 GMT, while the dollar was down 0.05
percent against a basket of currencies <.DXY>.
 A slew of earnings due shortly has helped keep focus on
Asian stocks, but the Singapore stock exchange's  $8.3
billion takeover of Australia's ASX Ltd  faced a hurdle
after key political leaders voiced concern over the deal and
hinted they may oppose it in parliament. [ID:nSGE69O0MV]
 SGX stock was up 0.3 percent after falling 6.2 percent on
Monday.
 Australia's Greens Party, which holds the balance of power
in the upper house Senate, said it had strong concerns about
the deal and may not support lifting the ASX's 15 percent
ownership cap.
 Shares of Sony Corp <6758.T> rose nearly 3 percent for a
while as traders cited media reports speculating that the
Japanese electronics maker could be a potential acquisition
target of Apple Inc . [ID:nTOE69P04I]
 Helping to spark interest was a Saturday report in Barron's
that said Apple could be contemplating a big acquisition and
noted speculation of Adobe , Sony or Disney  as
potential targets.
 Elsewhere, U.S. light sweet crude oil  was down 0.29
percent, to $82.27 per barrel while gold was up 0.09 percent.
 Commodities prices largely remained tied to the fate of the
dollar. Since June, the rolling 90-day correlation between the
U.S. dollar index and the Reuters-Jefferies CRB <.CRB> index of
19 commodities has been between -0.83 to -0.95, showing that
when one rises the other will very likely decline.
 A continued rebound in the dollar will probably keep a lid
on gold and copper.

 SYDNEY, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Australian rare-earths miner
Arafura Resources signalled plans on Tuesday to raise money,

restricts exports of the strategic resource.
 China, which supplies about 95 percent of the world's rare

 NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The dollar fell broadly on
Monday as traders braced for the U.S. central bank to turn on
the printing press again next week even as the G20 pledged to
shun competitive currency devaluation.
 The Federal Reserve is expected to launch a second round of
asset purchases at its Nov. 2-3 meeting, a process intended to
push U.S. interest rates even lower and one that would make the
dollar less attractive than higher-yielding currencies.
 That drove the greenback to a 15-year low against the yen
and weakened it against most other major currencies, including
the euro and Australian dollar.
 Speculation that G20 finance leaders would strike a truce
on exchange rate disputes at a weekend meeting and perhaps set
targets for reducing trade imbalances provided a dollar respite
last week, but analysts said the lack of a concrete agreement
was a green light to sell the dollar ahead of Fed easing.
 While U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner reiterated
at the G20 meeting that the United States supports a strong
dollar, analysts expect more dollar weakness ahead.
 ""It is one thing for the Treasury to say that, but then the
Fed holds all the ammunition and when it is set to print more
money, the dollar will remain a weakened currency,"" said Jane
Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank.

on railroad tracks right now and heading in one direction""
toward more easing.

 YEN, EURO GAIN
 The dollar fell to 80.41 yen on trading platform EBS, a
15-year low and within reach of a 79.75 record low. Japan
intervened to little avail last month to slow the yen's gains,
and traders said chances of more official yen selling would
increase if the dollar falls below 80 yen. It was last down 0.7
percent at 80.78 yen .
 The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.3965 . Earlier it hit
$1.4080 after breaking through resistance at $1.4051, but pared
gains after data showed sales of previously owned U.S. homes
rose a surprising 10 percent last month. [ID:nN25264142]
 Traders said the euro may target its recent 8-1/2-month
high around $1.4161 this week but said the presence of some
large option barriers, including one at $1.4215 set to expire
on Wednesday, could slow further gains.
 That could lead to stronger-than-usual defense of that
level, with the barrier payout said to be 30 million euros.
More typical option payouts are in the 3-5 million euro range.
 One trader said real money accounts and trend-following
commodity trading advisers were seen buying the euro and the
Australian dollar, while another cited buying of the euro and
the Australian dollar by Asian accounts.
 The Australian dollar rose 0.8 percent to $0.9904 ,
boosted by news that Singapore Exchange  will buy
Australian bourse operator ASX  and expectations of a
rate hike early next month. [ID:nSGE69N02J].
 In a Reuters poll earlier this month, U.S. primary dealers
projected the size of quantitative easing in a range of $500
billion to $1.5 trillion [FED/R].
 Analysts said that has made it tough to make too much of

 * Refineries linked to Fos-Lavera port still dry
 * Clearing crude backlog could take weeks
 
 (Adds details in fifth paragraph on the affected plants)
 By Emma Farge
 LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - France's oil industry is unlikely
to make a swift return to normality even as some refineries
prepar to return to work, given that more strikes are in the
diary and workers continue to block a key port.
 Workers at three of France's 12 refineries on Monday voted
to lift blockades and restart operations after President Nicolas
Sarkozy got Senate approval on Friday for a bill raising the
eligible pension age by two years to 62.
 The news raised hopes the sector would lurch back into
action after a crippling strike, which has led to fuel shortages
at a quarter of French petrol stations.
 But while some traders said the worst was probably over,
most traders and analysts were doubtful of a quick recovery as
many strikers held firm. European oil product prices rose on
Monday.
 Workers at seven other French refineries voted on Monday to
keep striking, including at all of Total's six plants and at the
fuel depot linked to the LyondellBasell-owned Berre L'Etang
plant in the south.
 ""Even if the legislation is fully passed and some refiners
end the strike, some people may still continue to put pressure
on the government to backpedal,"" said a crude oil trader.
 ""The guys already have two more nationwide protests
scheduled,"" he added.
 Unions have called for nationwide protests on Oct. 28 and
again on Nov. 6 as they seek to maintain pressure on the
government after the Senate approved the pensions bill on
Friday, ahead of its final adoption due this week.
 In September, before the strike had an effect on output,
French refineries produced 1.557 million barrels of oil products
a day, of which the majority was distillates such as diesel for
cars and jet fuel for heating.
 The production losses have not been specified by the French
oil industry or the government but are estimated to cover a
large share of potential output.
 
 NO CRUDE
 Two of the refineries that have voted to restart -- the
Exxon Mobil-owned Fos-sur-mer plant and the Petroplus-owned
Reichstett refinery -- are reliant on pipeline supplies from
the blocked port of Fos-Lavera.
 ""If they end the strike, and they are 'at work' on Tuesday
at Fos -- a refinery that can't work because it still has no
crude -- then they can still keep France tight on products, but
get paid,"" said an oil analyst and trader at a major bank.
 ""It's like being paid to strike.""
 Many see port workers at the Fos-Lavera terminal as more
determined than the refinery workers, who joined more recently
nearly two weeks ago when the national movement began.
 Port workers at Fos have been on strike since Sept. 27 over
port reform and were blocking 57 oil vessels on Monday,
including 38 with crude oil and 19 carrying refined products.
 Until work resumes at the Fos port, eight refineries in
France, Switzerland and Germany will struggle to get supplies.
 ""I think the situation should calm gradually, but it will
take two to three weeks for things to go back to normal,"" said
Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch.
 ""You can't be at full capacity from one day to another, and
offloading takes time.""
 Restarting a refinery that has been shut for a while --
known as a ""cold start"" -- can take up to a week, oil product
traders said.
 A French shipping agent on Monday estimated it would take
around 15 days to clear crude oil vessels waiting to unload at
Fos-Lavera and a week to clear products.
 The country's second-largest oil port, Le Havre in northern
France, was also halted and 13 oil tankers blocked on Monday,
port data showed.
 Until refineries are back in working order, France will be
forced to resort to stop-gap measures such as importing into
smaller oil ports and across the German and Italian borders on
barges, trucks and rail cars.
 It had begun to import gasoline through the port of Rouen in
northern France to relieve supply shortages.

 BERLIN, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The German government plans a
500,000 euros cap on the income of employees at banks that have
received state support, sources said on Monday.
 Banks in which the state owns 75 percent or more, such as
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), should be allowed to pay salaries no
higher than 500,000 euros to employees and board members with no
additional bonus, the sources said.
 For banks in which the state has a lower stake, such as in
Commerzbank, the limit would also be 500,000 euros, but the pay
could be made up of fixed and variable parts, with the latter
not to be paid in case of insolvency proceedings.
 The new rules on capping bonuses would not be valid for
claims that originated before the start of 2011.
 Commerzbank's ability to pay eye-popping bonuses was capped
in 2008 and 2009 at the request of the German government, which
took a stake in the bank after providing an 18 billion euro
bailout following the collapse of investment bank Lehman Bros.
 Commerzbank has since appealed to shareholders and the
government to revise the compensation structure as a way to
remain competitive as rival firms continue to pay higher
salaries to top bankers. The bank declined comment on Monday.
 Exceptions were possible if the banks paid full interest on
the state rescue or had paid back half of the money to the
federal government, the sources also said.
 The new rules were set to become part of a restructuring law
for banks and will have to be agreed by the ruling coalition of
Christian Democrats and Free Democrats on Tuesday, with a
parliamentary decision due on Thursday.

 * Cbank, IMF warn over fiscal sustainability risks
 * IMF says Hungary govt plans ""bold but risky""
 
 By Krisztina Than and Gergely Szakacs
 BUDAPEST, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday criticised
unorthodox government measures to fix the budget and boost
growth, warning of risks to fiscal sustainability.
 The National Bank (NBH) kept interest rates at a record low
of 5.25 percent for the sixth month in a row as expected earlier
on Monday, but warned of risks to inflation and markets from the
deficit-cutting plans.
 The IMF said the government's plans were ""bold but risky"",
warning against changes Budapest envisages to the pension
system, saying the reforms could undermine investor confidence
and did not address the budget's structural position.
 The government's plans include cuts in personal income tax,
special taxes on the energy, telecoms and retail sectors as well
as measures which pension industry figures have warned would add
up to renationalisation of a successfully reformed system.
 ""The government's commitment to the 3 percent budget deficit
target for 2011 was beneficial but ... caused a rift in ...
making uncertain the effects of the measures on long-term
sustainability,"" Governor Andras Simor said.
 The NBH has kept rates at a historic low of 5.25 percent
for most of this year after 10 months of easing aimed at
reviving an economy that needed IMF and EU aid to pull through
the global financial crisis.
 The bank said in its statement on Monday that it may need to
hike interest rates ""if upside risks to inflation materialise or
there is a sustained increase in perceptions of the risks
associated with the economy"".
 Most analysts expect Hungarian rates to stay steady into
next year as weak domestic demand keeps a lid on inflation, but
the budget uncertainty makes it less clear how markets will
treat both the forint and government bonds.
 That said, the currency remains around one percent higher
than at the central bank last meeting in September, trading
around 274 against the euro on Monday amid supportive global
sentiment.
 
 IMF WARNING
 The IMF's delegation head, Christoph Rosenberg, told a news
conference on Monday after Article IV consultations with Hungary
that the IMF had not discussed any new -- precautionary or other
-- financing deal.
 ""We did not discuss this issue at all,"" Rosenberg said when
asked whether Hungary signalled interest in the Fund's new
precautionary credit line.
 The government had ruled out a new deal with the Fund after
it unexpectedly halted talks with lenders in July, but some
market players were expecting it to backtrack on this stance.
 Rosenberg said crisis taxes would help the government to
meet its 3.8 percent of GDP budget deficit target this year, but
measures announced so far were not quite sufficient to ensure
that the 2011 target would also be achieved.
 He also said the government's measures would help labour
participation.
 But he added the measures were also risky as it was
uncertain how the economy would react to them and ""(they) ...do
raise questions about medium-term fiscal sustainability.""
 The IMF said Hungary's economy was expected to grow by close
to 1 percent this year and by around 2.5 percent next year, but
the reaction of the economy to the tax measures was uncertain.
 The government has suspended payment transfers to mandatory
private pension funds from November which will leave an
additional at least 420 billion forints ($2.15 billion) in the
state budget in the next 14 months.
 ""We cautioned the authorities against this step because we
think that it may in the short term resolve a goal -- showing
better fiscal deficits on a headline basis -- but does not
address the structural fiscal position,"" Rosenberg said.

 * Taxpayers Assn says no-bailout clause must not be changed
 
 By Sarah Marsh
 BERLIN, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Changing the EU treaty to allow a
permanent rescue mechanism would be ""extremely dangerous"",
Germany's taxpayers' association (BdSt) said on Monday, echoing
concerns that nearly stalled a key euro zone aid programme.
 Berlin wants to reform the European Union's Lisbon treaty to
incorporate a permanent system for handling financial crises
such as the possible collapse of a sovereign debt issuer.
 Many experts say this would entail changing the treaty's
no-bailout clause -- a controversial issue for German taxpayer
representatives who fiercely opposed forking out money for
debt-ridden Greece earlier this year.
 ""This is extremely dangerous,"" said Reiner Holznagel, head
of the BdSt which has over 300,000 members.
 ""The no-bailout clause is absolutely crucial because we
don't want it to lead to financial transfers which would reward
those (countries) that do not have solid budgets and punish
those that are sorting their budgets out.""
 
 For stories on Europe's debt struggle, click [ID:nLDE68T0MG]
 For a graphic http://r.reuters.com/hyb65p

 The EU currently has only the European Financial Stability
Fund (EFSF), a temporary mechanism created in May this year to
handle the fallout from Greece's debt problems.
 Berlin is uncomfortable with the 500-billion-euro EFSF,
which expires in 2013, because it comes dangerously close to
violating the no-bailout clause, which has led to legal
challenges in Germany's highest court.
 It wants a treaty change to make the legal option of either
conditional help or default more clear.
 ""It would be difficult to introduce a permanent rescue
mechanism without changing the treaty,"" a German government
official said. ""The point of the treaty change is to have
something that is legally watertight and very solid.""
 But the BdSt's Holznagel said the no-bailout clause should
remain in place as it is needed to create the right incentives
for countries to keep a balanced budget.
 Germany has spearheaded a European-wide push to reduce
soaring public deficits by introducing strict austerity
measures. Many Germans resented helping bankroll a euro zone
bailout package earlier this year for use by other countries
which they saw as fiscally irresponsible.
 ""Politicians' reactions to the crisis have been the same as
those that led to crisis, namely the unscrupulous path to
indebtedness,"" said Holznagel, noting that his association would
lobby against a change to the no-bailout clause.
 Holznagel said the Greek debt crisis had shown political
influence on the European Central Bank was ""much too big"" and
politicians were playing with the stability of the euro.
 ""We have to find a way back to the ECB making decisions
independently and not under political influence,"" he said.

pension funds and other large institutional investors say they
are pushing for active ways to hedge currencies in a bid to
reduce risk and provide better returns on currencies themselves.
 In the current ultra-low interest rate environment,
investors are increasingly turning to riskier assets such as
foreign-denominated equities and currency managers see an
opportunity to increase returns on the currency portion as well.
 ""It is a myth that currency gains and losses wash out,"" said
Colin Crownover, managing director of currency management at
State Street Global Advisors which has $83 billion in assets
under management. ""It is not a zero sum game for an investor.""
 State Street says its ""dynamic strategic hedges"" is designed
to reduce currency risk without sacrificing return. Its strategy
has yielded an annual return of 3.06 percent, which has beaten a
2.45 percent return against a zero hedge, or a 1.82 percent
return on a passive hedge of 50 percent.
 Most investors employ a passive 50 percent hedge.
 The maximum drawdown, or loss, has also been smaller for
dynamic hedging at -6.78 percent versus -13.96 for unhedged
assets and -7.57 for static hedging of 50 percent.
 Pro-cyclical currencies such as the Australian dollar also
carry a risk premium, which would also need to be taken into
account when setting hedging ratios, it added.
""We look at generating return depending on how far away a
currency is from fair value based on our purchasing power parity
model,"" Crownover said.
 Purchasing power parity refers to a theory that estimates
the amount of adjustment needed in an exchange rate in order for
it to be equivalent to each currency's purchasing power.
 
 APPETITE FOR YIELD
 With the U.S. Federal Reserve expected to expand its asset
purchases as early as next week and other major central banks in
no hurry to raise interest rates, prices on equities and
commodities have soared as investors hunt for better returns as
bond yields remain at rock-bottom levels.
 ""There is a strong appetite for yield but investors can't
get them through money markets or short-term bonds,"" said Pierre
Lequeux, head of currency management at Aviva Investors, the
asset management arm of British insurer Aviva.
 ""More pension funds may be taking an aggressive stance
towards equities, which are usually unhedged,"" he said.
 ""We want to be more tactical by reducing risk by providing a
degree of 'alpha'.""
 An alpha product uses manager skill to, in theory, strongly
outperform a given target such as a market benchmark.
 Aviva focuses on G10 currencies and is working on a stand-
alone product although no date has been set yet for its release.
 Currencies have fluctuated sharply since a global financial
crisis erupted in late 2008, with the dollar moving some 10
percent on either side against the euro in several one-month
periods since that time.

 * Obama, Lee set deadline to fix deal by Nov G20 meeting
 * Auto, beef issues are biggest outstanding concerns
(Adds industry, lawmaker comments)
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Top U.S. and South Korean
trade officials will meet in San Francisco on Tuesday to
discuss how to fix beef and auto trade problems that have
blocked approval of a free trade agreement since 2007.
 The meeting comes just a couple of weeks before a Nov.
10-12 deadline set by President Barack Obama and South Korean
President Lee Myung-bak for resolving differences over the
pact, so Obama can submit it to Congress for approval.
 The U.S. Trade Representative's office on Monday announced
the meeting between U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk and
South Korean Trade Minister Kim Jong-hoon. However, it did not
reply to requests for additional information.
 Doug Goudie, director of international trade policy at the
National Association of Manufacturers, said he did not expect
the two sides to announce a deal on Tuesday.
 ""But I would hope their discussions tomorrow put them a
long way down the road towards an agreement on the outstanding
issues,"" Goudie said.
 Obama -- whose fellow Democrats may lose their U.S. House
of Representatives majority in the Nov. 2 elections but
probably keep control of the Senate -- criticized the agreement
negotiated by the administration of his predecessor, George W.
Bush, when he was running for president in 2008.
 But since taking office 21 months ago, he has promised to
resolve problems with the pact.
 He made his most forceful commitment after a meeting with
Lee in June in Toronto at the Group of 20 summit.
 ""I want to make sure that everything is lined up properly
by the time I get to Korea in November, and in a few months
following that, I intend to present it to Congress,"" he said.
 Obama is going to Seoul for next Group of 20 summit, which
South Korea will host. Many see his ability to resolve issues
blocking the agreement as a test of his international
leadership on trade in the face of opposition at home.
 Rep. Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican who could chair a key
congressional trade subcommittee if his party wins control of
the House, said South Korea should not wait to see the outcome
of Nov. 2 election before striking a deal.
 ""Regardless of who holds the majority in Congress, the two
remaining issues must be resolved satisfactorily,"" Brady said
at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
 He also emphasized the importance of meeting the G20
deadline and said if that happened he was optimistic Congress
would approve the pact during the first six months of 2011.
 The push to wrap up the agreement comes at a difficult time
for Democrats because many party activists Obama is trying to
get to the polls on Nov. 2 oppose the agreement.
 That includes the United Auto Workers union and the
12.2-million member AFL-CIO labor federation, which helped
Obama win key industrial states in his 2008 presidential bid.
 Union workers are unhappy that a 25 percent U.S. tariff on
pickup trucks would be phased out over 10 years and a 2.5
percent tariff on cars would be immediately eliminated.
 Ford Motor Co. has complained the pact does not do enough
to dismantle nontariff, or regulatory, barriers it says keep
U.S. cars out of South Korea.
 Seoul has defended the agreement as a hard-struck bargain
in which both sides have already compromised.
 Under the pact, Seoul would immediately eliminate an 8
percent tariff on all U.S. passenger cars and revamp a tax
system that imposes higher taxes on cars with larger engines.
 The agreement also contains a ""snap-back"" provision that
would allow the United States to reimpose tariffs under certain
circumstances and creates a bilateral auto working group that
would serve as an ""early warning system"" for potential
regulatory issues that could impede auto trade.
 ""The United States wants to take one or two things back""
from the agreement, Kim told a Seoul audience last week during
a discussion on the trade pact. ""But the thing is when you
start taking things back, it's like a Pandora's box.""
 South Korea has already taken steps to open its market to
more U.S. beef by agreeing in 2008 to accept all cuts from
cattle under the age of 30 months.
 However, its reluctance to accept more types of U.S. beef
has been an obstacle to congressional approval of the FTA.
 The United States has struggled to completely reopen a
number of Asian markets in the aftermath of some cases of mad
cow disease found in the U.S. cattle herd earlier this decade.

1320,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2010 09:56AM ET</span>",Global protectionism threatens EU recovery-EU study," * Report singles out Russian, Chinese protectionist measures
 * Global trade barriers to have ""lasting impact""
 * China rare earths restrictions ""very worrying"" 
 * EU agro-food, car, textile, services sectors worst hit
 
 BRUSSELS, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Russian import restrictions and
similar moves by China, Brazil and Argentina threaten to hold
back European economic recovery, an EU Commission study
published on Monday said, but Europe plans to fight back.
 Europe's major trading partners have imposed or planned 332
new trade restrictions since the global downturn in 2008, from
import substitution and export taxes to limits on investment and
government procurement, the study showed.
 More than 60 measures took effect in the last six months,
despite several commmitments by G20 leading economic nations
against such steps.
 The EU is set to unveil plans next month for legal and
political weapons to fight restrictions by its main trade
partners, according to policy plans seen by Reuters.
 ""The world's major economies must remove trade restrictive
measures that put a brake on growth"" because the economic
recovery is still fragile, EU trade chief Karel De Gucht said in
a comment on the report.
 World Trade Organisation head Pascal Lamy warned earlier
this month that the world's trading powers may be in a spiral of
measures that could hamper economic recovery.
 Trade barriers have affected the EU more than most other
trading regions, hitting 1.7 percent of EU goods exports -- and
were likely to continue do to so, the report said.
 ""It is...likely there will be a lasting impact on EU trade
flows, even after the crisis,"" the report says, identifying the
worst affected sectors as labour-intensive agro-food,
automotive, textiles, clothing and services.
 
 RUSSIA, ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, SOUTH AFRICA AND CHINA
 Key points of the report:
 * Russia has imposed the most restrictive measures since the
start of the global crisis, most recently with numerous
import-substitution policies and local-content requirements for
foreign investment.
 * China recently cut its export quota for rare earths used
in high-tech goods and internet communication equipment, and
export restrictions generally increased between May and Sept
2010. ""This is a very worrying trend,"" the report says.
 * Argentina's import licensing regime and import reference
values remain of ""serious concern"".
 * South African has put up trade barriers with the aim of
developing numerous industrial sectors.
 * Brazil has joined a growing list of countries that
restrict foreign bids for lucrative government procurement
contracts for projects like roads, hospitals and water
sanitation.
 ""The negative trend in government procurement, already
highlighted in previous periods, is again confirmed and there is
evidence of new worrying developments,"" the report concluded.

 * CEO says food inflation to ease with more foreign players
 * Optimistic about U.S. business this Christmas: CEO
 
 By Paul de Bendern
 NEW DELHI, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart, the world's largest
retailer, expects India to open up foreign direct investment in
multi-brand retail given the positive tone coming from
government officials, its chief executive said on Monday.
 India's $450-billion retail sector, with organised retail
accounting for just 6 percent, is largely closed to foreign
firms and favours small stores which provide livelihoods for
hundreds of thousands and serve a market of more than 1 billion.
 But Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government has begun to
speak more positively about relaxing the rules, despite the
potential political backlash this could cause with some of the
ruling Congress party's rural grass-root voters.
 ""Regarding the timing (of opening up the sector), it is not
really my position to set this. It is for the Indian government
but the feeling I get is a very positive feeling in the
discussions we have had (with government officials),"" Wal-Mart
Stores Inc CEO Mike Duke told a news conference.
 Duke also said he was optimistic about Wal-Mart's discount
store business in the United States for the upcoming Christmas
season, adding that the company has taken steps to have a more
positive shopping season compared with 2009.
 ""There is still an overhang of concern and that impacts
consumers,"" Duke said in India's capital city. ""Regarding our
own business we're optimistic.""
 Wal-Mart, in an equal partnership with India's top telecoms
group Bharti Enterprise, operates four cash-and-carry outlets in
India and also supplies to retail stores run by Bharti.
 The joint venture plans to open a fifth store late in
November or in early December this year.
 Duke declined to say how the world's largest retailer would
react to a sudden decision to open up the Indian retail sector.
 ""Depending on the outcome (of any government decision) we
will look with our partners as to what the next steps are.""
 Wal-Mart has long been courting the Indian government, the
private sector and local farmers to win support for removing
restrictions to foreign companies investing in multi-brand
retailing in the world's second-most populous country.
 Duke met India's commerce minister as well as the deputy
planning commission chief, who is in charge of initial proposals
on how to relax FDI limitations in India's retailing sector.
 
 LUCRATIVE MARKET
 Most top retailers such as Wal-Mart and French retailer
Carrefour have been waiting for India to ease foreign ownership
restrictions to begin retail operation.
 ""It is our desire to see 100 percent opening to FDI but we
do understand...a thoughtful approach to opening up and we
respect that,"" Duke said.
 India represents tremendous opportunities for foreign
players given the size of the population, expected economic
growth, a growing middle class and the lack of a mature and
organised retail market.
 Analysts say opening retail to foreign direct investment may
help create thousands of jobs and rein in food price inflation
by curbing waste in a country where at least 40 percent of
produce rots because of inadequate storage and transportation.
 ""Thirty to 40 percent of produce never makes it to the
consumer and that cost ends up being consumed in the system,""
Duke said. ""Competition is just good for business and consumers
benefit from that.""
 He did not comment on whether he expected U.S. President
Barack Obama to lobby on behalf of Wal-Mart and other U.S. firms
in opening up the Indian market when he visits next month.
 India's current rules limit FDI in single-brand retail
outlets to 51 percent, while retailers that carry multiple
brands are restricted to cash-and-carry or wholesale outlets.
 Germany's Metro AG operates cash-and-carry outlets in India,
while Carrefour plans to set up wholesale stores.
 India this year took a tentative step towards opening up
retail in Asia's third-largest economy by putting out a
discussion paper, but it steered clear of suggesting changes to
the existing investment cap.
 The entry of multinational retailers into India has been
mired in controversy, with moves to open up the sector opposed
by leftist parties and small traders fearful of job losses.

 (Updates prices, adds detail, comment)
 NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a fresh
15-year low against the yen on Monday in a broad sell off after
a Group of 20 agreement to shun competitive currency
devaluations and allow market forces to set exchange rates.
 At the meeting in South Korea, G20 finance chiefs struck a
surprise deal to give emerging nations a bigger voice in the
International Monetary Fund, recognising the quickening shift
in economic power away from Western industrial nations.
[ID:nTOE69M004]
 Analysts said the outcome pointed to a status quo in
currency markets, with the dollar staying under pressure due to
expectations for the Federal Reserve to unveil a second round
of quantitative easing as early as its Nov. 2-3 meeting.
 The G20 statement ""didn't go far enough as saying countries
won't devalue their currencies so we saw the yen go to a fresh
15-year high,"" said John Doyle, strategist at Tempus Consulting
in Washington. ""The focus now is on the Fed's November 3
meeting and expectations of further quantitative easing.""

 The dollar index, which measures its value against a basket
of currencies, dropped 0.6 percent to 76.922 <.DXY>, but
support was seen around its 10-month low of 76.14.
 The dollar fell over 1 percent against the yen to 80.41 yen
on electronic trading platform EBS , its lowest in 15
years. Market players said chances of Japanese yen-selling
intervention would increase if the dollar fell below 80.00 yen
and tests its record low of 79.75 yen.
 In early New York trade the dollar was last at 80.55 yen

 The euro climbed 0.5 percent to $1.4021 , having
risen as high as $1.4080 and breaking through resistance at
$1.4051. The move was significant as the euro had failed
several times in recent days to break through and hold the
$1.4000 level.
 The euro rally on Monday marked the 76.4 percent
retracement of the euro's drop to $1.3697 last week from an
8-1/2 month high of $1.4161 hit earlier this month.
 Some traders expect $1.4161 to be reached soon. But gains
above there were likely to be checked due to the presence of
some large option barriers, including a one-touch option
barrier at $1.4215 that is set to expire on Wednesday.
 That could lead to a stronger-than-usual defense of that
level with the barrier payout said to be a massive 30 million
euros. Normal option payouts are usually in the order of 3-5
million euros.
 One trader said real money accounts and trend-following
commodity trading advisers were seen buying the euro and the
Australian dollar, while another cited buying of the euro and
the Australian dollar by Asian accounts.
 The Australian dollar surged roughly 1.2 percent to $0.9948
, boosted by news that Singapore Exchange 
will buy Australian bourse operator ASX , and
expectations of a rate increase early next month.
[ID:nSGE69N02J].
 FOCUS ON FED
 That was in sharp contrast to the U.S. where the Federal
Reserve looks set to ease monetary policy further.
 While U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner reiterated
that the United States supports a strong dollar at the G20
meeting, there were few takers for that.
 ""It is one thing for the Treasury to say that, but then the
Fed holds all the ammunition and when it is set to print more
money, the dollar will remain a weakened currency,"" said Jane
Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank.
 Analysts at Goldman Sachs said the Fed is almost certain to
announce renewed monetary easing at next week's policy meeting.
They said it may announce $500 billion in asset purchases or a
bit more over a period of about six months, and the size could
eventually reach $2 trillion.
 In a Reuters poll earlier this month, U.S. primary dealers
projected the size of quantitative easing in a range of $500
billion to $1.5 trillion [FED/R].

 * G20 central bankers pledged to take that into account
 
 By Daniel Flynn
 PARIS, Oct 25 (Reuters) - There is a risk of an asset bubble
in emerging economies due to monetary easing in the developed
world and a weekend meeting of G20 central bankers vowed to take
this into account, the head of the OECD said in an interview.
 Angel Gurria, secretary-general of the 33-member
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, said the
OECD saw a possibility that rich nations' monetary stimulus to
heal their economies could have a negative impact elsewhere.
 ""Yes, there is a risk,"" he told Reuters after attending a
weekend meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bankers in
South Korea. ""Accommodative monetary policies in OECD countries
are being exported to developing economies and that ... can
create bubbles and can create distortions.""
 Gurria said the G20 talks in the historic Korean city of
Gyeongju acknowledged it was legitimate for countries to act
unilaterally in response to the multi-billion dollar capital
flows heading toward developing nations due to this cheap money.
 He said central bankers from industrialised nations,
including the United States, also recognised the need to take
capital flowsinto account when setting monetary policy.
 ""Everyone is now much more aware and much more cautious.""
said Gurria. ""All the central banks said that they would ... try
to take account of these spillover effects.""
 The G20 talks unexpectedly clinched a landmark deal to hand
more voting power at the IMF to under-represented countries like
China, India and Brazil and for member states to refrain from
competitive devaluations. [ID:nTOE69M01A]
 ""This agreement is a great vote of confidence in the G20,""
said Gurria. ""Not only did the G20 deliver on the immediate task
to stabilise the world economy in 2008 after the collapse of
Lehman Brothers, but it is now resolving other issues which have
stubbornly resisted collective action for years.""
 
 G20 DEAL ""WORK IN PROGRESS""
 Some observers, however, expressed frustration that the
meeting failed to agree on U.S. proposals to slap limits on the
current account imbalances which underlie currency swings.
 The final G20 communique committed to ""maintaining current
account imbalances at sustainable levels"" and said that
indicative guidelines would be agreed, without saying when.
 ""This agreement is a work in progress but ... the radar is
now focused on this question of global imbalances in a way that
it was not before,"" Gurria said. ""People are going to be
enormously careful to make sure they are not looking like they
are overstepping the line.""
 British Economy Minister George Osborne said limits on trade
imbalances were likely to be discussed at a G20 leaders' summit
in Seoul next month, but he and others such as Canadian Finance
Minister Jim Flaherty were cautious about whether a deal could
be reached quickly.
 Formed in 1999, in the wake of the turmoil in emerging
markets following the East Asia crisis, the G20 gathers emerging
and industrialised nations representing more than 80 percent of
global output. 
 It replaced the G8 last year as the main forum for the
world's major economies to resolve economic issues, as the
global crisis brought home the need for broader consultation.
 Gurria said it was unrealistic to expect a two-day
ministerial meeting to reach agreement on an issue as complex as
targeting trade imbalances, but he said the G20 had made a leap
forward in the process of discussing such sensitive issues.
 ""There has been a very great improvement in the capacity to
communicate within the group,"" said Gurria, a former Mexican
finance minister and foreign minister. ""There is a growing
comfort zone which has been created to discuss some rather
complex and uncomfortable issues.""

 WARSAW, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The euro is close to being
overvalued and further gains could impede growth rates in the
single currency area, Bas Bakker, an economist at the
International Monetary Fund, told a news conference on Monday.
 ""(The) euro is at a level which we call close to
overvaluation. A stronger euro means slower growth (in the euro
zone). Should there be further appreciation, the effect will be
larger but it is difficult to comment on day-to-day
exchange-rate changes,"" Bakker said.
 The euro has gained ground recently amid signs the European
Central Bank is poised to wind down its stimulus programme as it
moves to normalise monetary policy, in contrast to expectations
of more quantitative easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve and
central banks in other developed economies.
 Group of 20 finance ministers meeting in South Korea at the
weekend agreed to address global currency imbalances by moving
towards market-determined exchange rates.
 But in the absence of any major policy initiatives from the
gathering, broad-based dollar selling resumed on Monday which
drove the euro through resistance at $1.4051. [ID:nLDE69O14J]
 ""All else equal, the stronger the euro, the lower the growth
of exports. But the euro is of course just one factor and it
also matters what happens to global GDP growth and what happens
with the recovery in the US,"" Bakker said.
 ""I would not focus on just one factor. Yes, more
appreciation of the euro would slow growth somewhat, but it is
only one factor.""

1331,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2010 07:16AM ET</span>",US drops appeal over WTO ruling on China chicken," * WTO ruling against U.S. restrictions stands
 * U.S. had already dropped offending measures
 GENEVA, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The United States allowed a World
Trade Organization (WTO) condemnation of U.S. restrictions on
imports of cooked chicken to stand on Monday by deciding not to
appeal a ruling by experts in a complaint brought by China.
 Parties to WTO disputes often appeal initial rulings,
dragging out the case for months or years.
 But in this case the United States already had dropped the
measures that China objected to -- a ban imposed by the U.S.
Congress in a spending bill preventing the U.S. authorities from
taking steps to process imports of Chinese chicken.
 At a meeting of the WTO's dispute settlement body, the
United States did not object to the adoption of the ruling
published on Sept. 29, a participant in the meeting, who asked
to remain anonymous, said.
 The dispute was one of several roiling U.S.-Chinese
relations. China had responded to the original U.S. ban by
imposing duties on U.S. chicken imports, and the two powers are
wrangling over their currency exchange rates.
 U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk has declared that
enforcement of international trade rules is a centrepiece of
U.S. trade policy.
 Like many trade disputes, this one originated in concerns
about food safety -- a consumer concern that politicians must
tackle, but which easily is abused for protectionist purposes.
 The U.S. had banned imports from China and some other Asian
countries after outbreaks of bird flu in 2004, but the spending
ban -- imposed after a series of food scares in China -- meant
that Chinese chicken could not enter the United States in
practice even after imports formally were allowed.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The dollar dropped broadly on
Monday, hitting a 15-year low versus the yen, as a Group of 20
agreement to shun competitive currency devaluations was taken as
a green light to resume dollar-selling by investors.
 At the meeting in South Korea, G20 finance chiefs struck a
surprise deal to give emerging nations a bigger voice in the
International Monetary Fund, recognising the quickening shift in
economic power away from Western industrial nations. They also
agreed to exchange rates being market-determined.
 Analysts said the outcome pointed to a status quo in
currency markets, with the dollar staying under pressure due to
expectations for the Federal Reserve to unveil a second round of
quantitative easing as early as at its Nov. 2-3 meeting.
 ""The G-20 was seen as a hurdle by some and now that is over,
investors are back to do what they are most comfortable with --
dollar-selling,"" said Ankita Dudani, G-10 currency strategist at
RBS.
 The dollar index, which measures its value against a basket
of currencies, dropped 0.9 percent to 76.799, but support was
seen around its 10-month low of 76.14 in the near term.
 The dollar fell over 1 percent against the yen to 80.41 yen
, its lowest in 15 years. Market players said chances of
Japanese yen-selling intervention would increase if the dollar
fell below 80.00 yen and tests its record low of 79.75 yen.
 By 1046 GMT it was at 80.60 yen, hovering near the strike
price of options at 80.50 yen due to expire later in the day.
 The euro climbed 0.6 percent to $1.4040, having risen as
high as $1.4080 and breaking through resistance at $1.4051.
 This was the 76.4 percent retracement of the euro's drop to
$1.3697 last week from an 8-1/2 month high of $1.4161 hit
earlier this month.
 Traders expect $1.4161 to be reached soon. But gains above
there were likely to be checked due to the presence of some
large option barriers, including a one-touch option barrier at
$1.4215 that is set to expire on Wednesday.
 That could lead to a stronger-than-usual defence of that
level with the barrier payout said to be a massive 30 million
euros. Normal option payouts are usually in the order of 3-5
million euros.
 One trader said real money accounts and trend-following
commodity trading advisers were seen buying the euro and the
Australian dollar, while another cited buying of the euro and
the Australian dollar by Asian accounts.
 The Australian dollar surged roughly 1.5 percent to $0.9973
, boosted by news that Singapore Exchange will buy Australian
bourse operator ASX, and expectations of a rate hike early next
month..
 
 FOCUS ON FED
 That was in sharp contrast to the U.S. where the Federal
Reserve looks all set to ease monetary policy further.
 While U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner reiterated
that the United States supports a strong dollar at the G20
meeting, there were few takers for that.
 ""It is one thing for the Treasury to say that, but then the
Fed holds all the ammunition and when it is set to print more
money, the dollar will remain a weakened currency,"" said Jane
Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank.
 Analysts at Goldman Sachs said the Fed is almost certain to
announce renewed monetary easing at next week's policy meeting.
They said it may announce $500 billion in asset purchases or a
bit more over a period of about six months, and the size could
eventually reach $2 trillion.
 In a Reuters poll earlier this month, U.S. primary dealers
projected the size of quantitative easing in a range of $500
billion to $1.5 trillion.

 By Daisy Ku
 HONG KONG, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The outstanding amount of
over-the-counter derivatives rose during the first half of 2010
despite calls by regulators to move much of the market on to
exchanges, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association
said on Monday.
 The ISDA said the total notional amount outstanding of OTC
derivatives amounted to $466.8 trillion as of June 30, up 1
percent from the end of 2009.
 Global regulators are trying to make derivatives trading
more transparent after the opacity of the OTC market was blamed
for the near-collapse of U.S. insurer AIG  in 2008.
[nLDE69C1SP]
 The Financial Stability Board (FSB) last week, ahead of a
G20 finance ministers' meeting in Seoul, recommended ways to
ensure that as many contracts are standardised so they can be
centrally cleared and traded on exchanges. [ID:nTOE69J086]
 Figures from the ISDA would indicate that the regulatory
process is only just beginning, with the OTC market continuing
to grow.
 The bulk of the increase was focused in the huge market for
interest swaps, with trade in the smaller equity and credit OTC
derivatives slipping.
 The notional amount outstanding of interest rate swaps,
options and cross-currency swaps grew by 2 percent to 434.1
trillion in the six months, from $426.7 trillion at the end of
2009, while volumes in credit derivatives and equity
derivatives were down 14 percent and 6 percent, respectively,
according to ISDA mid-year market survey.
 The ISDA survey also revealed that OTC derivatives at the
14 biggest international derivative dealers, known as the G14,
was $354.6 trillion, representing 82 percent of the total
volume reported.
 The top five U.S.-based dealers held 37 percent, or $172.3
trillion worth of OTC derivatives, according to the survey.

 * Fed QE prospects driving risk
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Investors on Monday ploughed a
familiar furrow of selling dollars and buying emerging shares,
concluding a Group of 20 meeting that produced lots of noise but
no firm policy initiatives had left market trends unchanged.
 MSCI's emerging market stock benchmark shot up more than 1
percent for a year-to-date gain of nearly 13 percent. The dollar
lost 0.8 percent against a basket of currencies.
 European shares were higher and Wall Street looked set to
open up.
 G20 finance ministers pledged on Saturday to move towards
market-determined exchange rates and commit to a full range of
policies to reduce excessive external imbalances.
 But no major policy initiatives emerged and the United
States failed in an attempt to shrink China's surplus.
 The effect was to set investors off again on their recent
pattern of selling the dollar in expectation of further
quantitative easing asset-buying from the Federal Reserve, which
essentially entails printing more dollars and lowers their value
accordingly.
 ""By demanding ""market determined exchange rates"" (at the
G20) the U.S is opening the floodgates for a further dollar
depreciation due to the ultra-expansionary monetary policy in
the U.S,"" Commerzbank said in a note.
 The dollar weakened broadly, losing 1 percent against the
Japanese yen while the euro gained half a percent to $1.4021.
 Analysts at Goldman Sachs said the Fed is almost certain to
announce renewed monetary easing at next week's policy meeting.
They said it may announce $500 billion in asset purchases or a
bit more over a period about six months, and the size could
eventually reach $2 trillion.
 
 PUMPING UP STOCKS
 The prospect of a weaker dollar and higher emerging market
currencies, as well as economic growth differentials, have
already triggered massive investment flows into emerging
markets.
 But the idea of huge dollar liquidity has also pumped up
equities in general.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 was up a third of a
percent on the day. Mining stocks were leading the charge on the
assumption that a weaker dollar drives commodity prices higher.
 ""Profitability and earnings are going to be up. This is a
sector that will have earnings upgrades. Even if the dollar
started to steady, there are supply constraints,"" said Philip
Isherwood, European equities strategist at Evolution Securities.
 Earlier, Japanese equities fell, with the Nikkei losing 0.27
percent as exporters were hurt by the rising yen.
 JPMorgan Asset Management, meanwhile, warned its clients not
to become too carried away with the prospect of QE.
 ""Strong asset price gains were seen as one of the primary
objectives of QE, with the central bank reportedly keen to boost
household wealth and to prompt risk appetite within the
economy,"" it said.
 ""As a result, strong gains ahead of the FOMC arguably reduce
the need for QE and thus increase the chances of disappointment
when the Fed finally announces the outcome of its
deliberations.""

 * Zloty seen stable in months ahead
 * Zloty near 4 vs euro good for economy
 * Inflation seen higher ahead than anticipated
By Karolina Slowikowska and Pawel Sobczak
 WARSAW, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Poland's economy could expand by
more than 3.5 percent in the third and fourth quarters, but
inflation may prove higher than previous forecasts and top the
central bank's target this year, a deputy finance minister told
Reuters in an interview.
 In comments cleared for release on Monday, Ludwik Kotecki
also said he expected the zloty to remain stable in months ahead
and that around 4 to the euro remained a ""good level"" for the
economy. The zloty now trades around 3.95 per euro.
 He said the government's inflation forecasts may be too
optimistic and that price growth could top the central bank's
2.5 percent target at the end of the year but should not exceed
3 percent.
 ""Recent macroeconomic data, including industrial output
data, proved better not only from what we had expected but also
from what markets had expected,"" Kotecki said.
 ""This means that this will also have an impact on GDP data -
both the third and fourth quarters, when growth should be faster
than in the second, that is faster than 3.5 percent.""
 Polish growth slowed to 1.7 percent in 2009 on the back of
the global downturn but has accelerated since, mainly driven by
domestic demand and consumption. 
 Investments remain in negative territory, however, and
Kotecki expected this to change.
 ""When it comes to the structure (of growth), we still lack
private investments. The private sector needs time after the
crisis to ensure the economic situation is stable and see about
economic prospects,"" he said.
 ""I am convinced that the private sector will gain momentum
next year. I am an optimist,"" he said, adding next year's growth
could accelerate to 3.5-4.0 percent.
 He saw the economy's ""potential growth"" at 3.5-4.0 percent,
signalling that next year's economic expansion could lead to
inflation pressures as the output gap was closing.
 ""I currently estimate the potential growth level at 3.5-4.0
percent. This growth level is also possible in real terms next
year. When it comes to the potential growth, the so-called
output gap is near closing. This could happen next year,""
Kotecki said.
 Inflation surprised in September by jumping to the central
bank's 2.5 percent target from 2.0 percent in August,
solidifying expectations for monetary tightening still this
year. But analysts remain split on when rates will go up from
the current record-low of 3.5 percent.
 The central bank meets this week to discuss rates and will
make its decision on Wednesday.
 ""Inflation at the end of the year will exceed the central
bank's target (2.5 percent) but certainly not 3.5 percent. It
will probably be no higher than 3 percent at the end of the
year,"" Kotecki said
 ""Next year inflation will probably not be lower than 2.3
percent (average annual inflation envisaged in the 2011 budget
bill). There is the risk of underestimating inflation.""
 Kotecki praised the zloty's recent behaviour, remaining in a
range of 3.99 to 3.89 against the euro since Sept. 1, and said
the currency would be positive for Poland's economy ahead.
 ""In the base scenario, I don't expect any sudden moves in
any direction. Just as in the last few months the zloty has been
hovering, it will probably be hovering in the coming months,""
Kotecki said.
 ""Having the zloty close to 4 (against the euro) is
beneficial for the economy. It is not inflationary, it is not
too strong for exporters, it is not too weak for importers. This
stabilising of the zloty is good.""

 LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The dollar dropped broadly on
Monday, hitting a 15-year low versus the yen, as a Group of 20

falling to its lowest in 15-years. Market players said chances

 The Australian dollar surged nearly 1.3 percent to $0.9954,
getting an additional boost from news that Singapore Exchange
will buy Australian bourse operator ASX.
 A surprise jump in Australian producer prices, despite their
limited correlation with consumer prices, fanned speculation
that the Reserve Bank of Australia may raise rates next month.

 That was in sharp contrast to the U.S. where the Federal

1343,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2010 03:56AM ET</span>",Japan's Toshiba gets ready for 70 yen/dollar," TOKYO, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Japanese electronics conglomerate
Toshiba Corp is stepping up its expansion of overseas production
and procurement to withstand a further rise in the yen as far as
70 to the dollar, its chief executive said on Monday.
 Toshiba conducted a stress test last October, dubbed ""Project
70"", that assumed an exchange rate of 70 yen to the dollar and
became the basis for expanded efforts to counter the effects of
the rising yen.
 ""People said the yen would never go to that level when we
came up with this plan last October, but looking at the weakness
of the dollar and the strength of the yen now, that may not be
too far from reality,"" Toshiba CEO Norio Sasaki said at the
Nikkei Global Management Forum in Tokyo.
 The dollar fell to a 15-year low against the yen on Monday,
drawing closer to its postwar record low of 79.75 yen set in 1995
as traders took a weekend G20 statement as a green light for
continued dollar weakness.
 Yen strength has taken its toll on Japan's export-fuelled
economy, with data on Monday showing export growth slowed for a
seventh consecutive month while policymakers struggle to keep the
fragile economic recovery intact.
 Sasaki said Toshiba's measures, which also include expanding
strong businesses and shrinking money-losing operations, have
been paying off and now the company's operating profit actually
rises by 700 million yen ($8.6 million) for each 1 yen gain in
the Japanese currency's value against the dollar.
 Yen strength against the dollar used to cut into Toshiba's
profit.
 He added, however, that the euro was a ""different story"".
 Strength in the yen generally hurts the competitiveness of
Toshiba, the world's No. 2 maker of NAND-type memory chips used
widely in cellphones and consumer electronics, as its rival
Samsung Electronics Co enjoys the benefits of a relatively weak
won.
 ""We have the currency issues and other disadvantages
including a high corporate tax,"" Sasaki said.
 ""What we can try to do is to stay ahead with advanced
technology while lessening the impacts (of these disadvantages).""
 The dollar has fallen steadily across the board, including
against the yen where the threat of intervention by Japanese
authorities has slowed but not halted the slide, as the market
anticipates a second round of quantitative easing from the
Federal Reserve.

 By Kevin Plumberg
 HONG KONG, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The dollar dropped on Monday
after a Group of 20 meeting produced enough agreement despite
discordant policies to keep the status quo on the trade of
selling the U.S. currency and buying stocks and commodities
such as copper.
 Major European stock markets were up shortly after opening
with the FTSEurofirst 300 index 0.40 percent higher.
 While the G20 meeting did not reach a consensus on details
such as numerical targets for a country's economic imbalances,
the group found common ground on the need for more ""market
determined"" exchange rates and concluded with a shift in power
to developing economies in the International Monetary Fund --
enough to avert an all-out currency war, for now.
 ""It looks like the market has taken the G20 as a green
light to continue with the trends up to that point, which have
been towards U.S. dollar weakness,"" said Sue Trinh, senior FX
strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong.
 Investor focus will probably shift to a Federal Reserve
policy meeting on Nov 2-3 that could result in the central bank
printing money to buy assets, although estimates of how big the
program will be varied widely.
 Dealers will parse a speech by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke at
1230 GMT for indications whether he is leaning toward
aggressive quantitative easing or a moderate approach.
 The U.S. dollar slid to a 15-year low against the yen of
80.65 yen, with some dealers confident the Bank of Japan would
not intervene to weaken its currency so soon after a G20
meeting promoting flexible exchange rates.
 The euro rose 0.8 percent to $1.4058, having risen 9.6
percent since September. A convincing move above $1.4050 means
the market will next want to target the 9-month high reached
last Friday, at $1.4160.
 Investors were essentially again betting against the dollar
after the G20 meeting reduced some risks of a goods trade
backlash from conflicting currency policies.
 Short-term investors on the International Monetary Market
had a collective bet against the dollar worth $25.8 billion for
the week ended Oct. 19, down from about $30 billion two weeks
prior.
 POST-G20 MARKET LIFTS ASIA FX
 After the G20, dealers were keen also to add to their bets
on additional strength in emerging Asian currencies, which many
policymakers believe have to be allowed to rise as part of a
recipe for fixing global economic imbalances.
 The region has been a magnet for capital flows and will
probably continue to see these flows of money push up domestic
currencies.
 ""The sharp drop in U.S. yields alongside robust Asian
fundamentals is fuelling large equity, fixed income and
speculative currency inflows into Asian economies. The prospect
of the Fed embarking on Fed QE2 in November suggests these FX
flows are unlikely to reverse meaningfully any time soon,""
Credit Suisse currency strategists said in a note.
 The dollar fell 0.9 percent against the South Korean won.
The won's broad trade-weighted exchange rate is roughly 13
percent below its 10-year average, Bank for International
Settlements data showed, partially the result of repeated
intervention by the Bank of Korea.
 Buying of Asia ex-Japan equities was spread out across
sectors, though financials, energy and commodities outperformed
slightly. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan
was up 1.8 percent after ending last week down 1.2 percent.
 Shares of Australia's ASX popped 19 percent higher after
Singapore Exchange said it wanted to buy Asia's third-largest
exchange for $8.3 billion. The deal would create the
fifth-largest exchange in the world.
 Japan's Nikkei share average was the odd man out, slipping
0.3 percent on cautiousness about how the yen's strength would
impact corporate results ahead of the earnings season.
 Japanese exports slowed for a seventh consecutive month in
September, stung by yen strength and slowing overseas demand.

 HONG KONG, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The dollar dropped on Monday
after a Group of 20 meeting produced enough agreement despite
discordant policies to keep the status quo on the trade of
selling the U.S. currency and buying stocks and commodities
such as copper.
 Major European stock markets were up shortly after opening
with the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index 0.40 percent higher.
 While the G20 meeting did not reach a consensus on details
such as numerical targets for a country's economic imbalances,
the group found common ground on the need for more ""market
determined"" exchange rates and concluded with a shift in power
to developing economies in the International Monetary Fund --
enough to avert an all-out currency war, for now.
 ""It looks like the market has taken the G20 as a green
light to continue with the trends up to that point, which have
been towards U.S. dollar weakness,"" said Sue Trinh, senior FX
strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong.
 Investor focus will probably shift to a Federal Reserve
policy meeting on Nov 2-3 that could result in the central bank
printing money to buy assets, although estimates of how big the
program will be varied widely.
 Dealers will parse a speech by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke at
1230 GMT for indications whether he is leaning toward
aggressive quantitative easing or a moderate approach.

 The U.S. dollar slid to a 15-year low against the yen of
80.65 yen , with some dealers confident the Bank of Japan
would not intervene to weaken its currency so soon after a G20
meeting promoting flexible exchange rates.
 The euro rose 0.8 percent to $1.4058 , having risen
9.6 percent since September. A convincing move above $1.4050
means the market will next want to target the 9-month high
reached last Friday, at $1.4160.
 Investors were essentially again betting against the dollar
after the G20 meeting reduced some risks of a goods trade
backlash from conflicting currency policies.
 Short-term investors on the International Monetary Market
had a collective bet against the dollar worth $25.8 billion for
the week ended Oct. 19, down from about $30 billion two weeks
prior. [ID:nN22200900]
 POST-G20 MARKET LIFTS ASIA FX
 After the G20, dealers were keen also to add to their bets
on additional strength in emerging Asian currencies, which many
policymakers believe have to be allowed to rise as part of a
recipe for fixing global economic imbalances.
 The region has been a magnet for capital flows and will
probably continue to see these flows of money push up domestic
currencies.
 ""The sharp drop in U.S. yields alongside robust Asian
fundamentals is fuelling large equity, fixed income and
speculative currency inflows into Asian economies. The prospect
of the Fed embarking on Fed QE2 in November suggests these FX
flows are unlikely to reverse meaningfully any time soon,""
Credit Suisse currency strategists said in a note.
 The dollar fell 0.9 percent  against the South Korean
won. The won's broad trade-weighted exchange rate is roughly 13
percent below its 10-year average, Bank for International
Settlements data showed, partially the result of repeated
intervention by the Bank of Korea.
 Buying of Asia ex-Japan equities was spread out across
sectors, though financials, energy and commodities outperformed
slightly. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan
was up 1.8 percent <.MIAPJ0000PUS> after ending last week down
1.2 percent.
 Shares of Australia's ASX  popped 19 percent higher
after Singapore Exchange  said it wanted to buy Asia's
third-largest exchange for $8.3 billion. The deal would create
the fifth-largest exchange in the world. [ID:nSGE69N02J]

 Japanese exports slowed for a seventh consecutive month in
September, stung by yen strength and slowing overseas demand.

1350,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2010 02:04AM ET</span>",Q+A-Why the jitters about China's rare earths exports?," BEIJING, Oct 25 (Reuters) - China's dominance of rare
earths used in high-tech products has aroused growing
international attention after reports that the government has
been choking off shipments, possibly out of political pique.
 Here is an explanation of the issue and why it matters.
 WHY ARE CHINA'S RARE EARTHS IMPORTANT?
 The computer you're possibly reading this on almost
certainly contains rare earths, a set of 17 minerals with
magnetic, luminescent and other properties that make them
useful in hard drives, magnets, lasers and other gadgets
important in computing, clean energy and military applications.
 Rare earths are relatively common in the ground but are
much more scarce in concentrations that make mining them
worthwhile.
 China produces about 97 percent of the world's rare earths,
and that means its policies in the sector ripple across the
world. China mined about 120,000 tonnes in 2008.
 It has about 36 percent of the world's known exploitable
reserves of rare earths. Since the 1990s, Chinese miners and
processors have massively expanded production while foreign
competitors in the United States and elsewhere have shut down.
 China's dominance has been helped by state support,
together with relatively low wages and loose regulation of
environmental damage caused by mining and processing rare
earths.
 HAS CHINA BEEN BLOCKING EXPORTS?
 Reports in the New York Times have said that China cut some
shipments of rare earths to Japan, possibly out of anger over a
sea territory dispute.
 The reports have also cited industry sources as saying
China may have taken similar steps against the United States
and Europe after Washington launched a trade investigation into
Chinese state support for clean energy technology.
 China does not have a history of using its economic sway as
a blunt political weapon, and nor does it have many resources
it can withhold. Perhaps that is changing.
 The difficulties some foreign purchasers have had may have
arisen from China's stricter enforcement of export quotas and
related measures, not out of pressure for political ends, said
Gareth Hatch, the founding principal of Technology Metals
Research, an Illinois-based company that follows the sector.
 China has said it has been alarmed to see its rare earths
reserves being mined so voraciously and then sold abroad at
prices that it says do not reflect the metals' real importance
and the environmental cost of processing them.
 That push to control exports has been stoked by China's
efforts in green technology, where rare earths can be used to
make more efficient batteries, wind turbines and other
technology.
 It has been imposing stricter controls on mining and
cracked down on unlicensed mining and smuggling.
 Beijing has introduced export duties and quotas for rare
earths. This year it steeply cut export quotas so total exports
for 2010 will be about 40 percent below 2009 levels. For the
second half of the year they will be 72 percent below levels in
the second half of 2009.
 ""I have heard of a handful of consumers of rare earths
outside of China have had a challenge acquiring certain
materials -- samarium would be one, used in permanent magnets;
compounds of lanthanum and cerium would be others -- used in a
variety of applications,"" Hatch wrote in an email.
 ""But this has been driven by the traders not wanting to
ship lower value light rare earths, in favor of the heavier,
more-valuable stuff. Most other folks I've spoken to have not
mentioned any issues, beyond grumbling about the price,"" he
wrote.
 WHAT DOES CHINA WANT TO DO WITH ITS RARE EARTHS?
 The government wants to get into more profitable higher-end
production and to nurture homegrown industry champions.
 China is also pushing to become a major force in green
technology in which rare earths are an important ingredient.
 Restricting exports will force foreign companies to buy
more of the completed products containing rare earths from
China until other countries increase their own production.
Beijing's quotas do not apply to finished products.
 WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS AND WHAT COULD HAPPEN?
 China's push has ignited economic and geo-political
jitters.
 One worry is that Beijing's chokehold on exports could hurt
foreign companies and drive up international prices.
 Hatch said some purchasers were ""aghast at the current
pricing as it puts them at a terrible price disadvantage
compared to their competitors based in China.""
 A more distant worry voiced by some in Washington is that
China could cut off the United States and other potential
rivals of access to minerals used in military equipment.
 Chinese officials from Premier Wen Jiabao down have said
that their government is not using its rare earth as a
political weapon.
 Last week officials denied a Chinese newspaper report that
China would cut quotas by 30 percent next year.
 Industry players will be waiting to find out what quotas
Beijing will set in place next year and beyond, and also want a
finer sense of how the quotas will work.
 Already some governments have said foreign companies should
not be so dependent on China for such an important ingredient.
 Mining outside China that offers access to rare earths
could benefit from this push, including in the United States,
Vietnam, South Africa, Australia and Canada.
 But mining rare earths is the easy part. The more difficult
and expensive part is separating and processing the minerals so
they can be used for final applications.
 Governments and companies will have to decide whether they
are willing to pay for that capability. It could be very
expensive and take years to set up such production facilities.

 * Market awaiting further clues on possible Fed easing
 * Investors including CTAs buy euro and Aussie -trader
 By Masayuki Kitano and Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The dollar fell broadly on Monday
as investors interpreted a Group of 20 agreement to shun
competitive currency devaluations as a green light to resume
dollar selling.
 At the meeting in South Korea, G20 finance ministers also
struck a surprise deal to give emerging nations a bigger voice in
the International Monetary Fund, recognising the quickening shift
in economic power away from Western industrial nations.
 Analysts said the outcome at the G20 pointed to the
continuation of a status quo in currency markets, with the dollar
staying under pressure due to market expectations for the U.S.
Federal Reserve to unveil a second round of quantitative easing
as early as November.
 ""It looks like the market has taken the G20 as a green light
to continue with the trends up to that point, which have been
towards U.S. dollar weakness,"" said Sue Trinh, senior FX
strategist at RBC in Hong Kong.
 The euro climbed 0.5 percent from late U.S. trading on Friday
to $1.4022.
 A break of $1.4051, the 76.4 percent retracement of the
euro's drop to $1.3697 last week from an 8-½ month high of
$1.4161 hit earlier this month on trading platform EBS, would
open the way for a retest of that $1.4161 peak.
 But another failure near $1.4050 could see a quick move back
down to $1.3700 or even to $1.3580.
 The Australian dollar surged 0.9 percent to $0.9906.
 One trader said real money accounts and trend-following
commodity trading advisers were detected buying the euro and the
Australian dollar.
 A trader for a Japanese bank said Asian accounts appeared to
be buying the euro and the Australian dollar, adding that they
may be building up fresh positions after having trimmed them
before the G20 meeting.
""My overall impression is that there was nothing out of the
G20 meeting that would lead to a dollar rise, or higher risk in
selling the dollar,"" the Japanese bank trader said.
 The dollar's broad slide was reflected in the dollar index,
which measures its value against a basket of currencies. The
index slipped 0.6 percent to 77.031.
 The dollar fell 0.4 percent against the yen to 81.07 yen,
dipping back toward a 15-year low of 80.84 yen struck on trading
platform EBS earlier in October.

(Adds comments from senior government official)
 By Rie Ishiguro
 TOKYO, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Japan's exports trumped
expectations in September, but the seventh consecutive slowdown
in annual growth showed the economy was feeling the pinch from
the strong yen and slackening growth in its overseas markets.
 The 14.4 percent increase from a year earlier well exceeded
economists' expectations, which some analysts took as a sign that
exports were proving more resilient to the currency's strength
and global headwinds than some had initially feared.
 ""The global economic slowdown and a strong yen indeed have
had a negative impact on the economy but the data supports the
view that the recovery trend has not disappeared,"" said Yoshimasa
Maruyama, an economist at Itochu Corp.
 Maruyama predicted exports to bottom out in the next six
months and start regaining pace some time after that.
 The headline figure came above a market consensus forecast of
a 9.6 percent rise and just below a 15.5 percent rise in August,
Ministry of Finance data showed on Monday.
 Yet the numbers, which also showed shipments dipping 0.1
percent from the previous month, and renewed downward pressure on
the dollar bode ill for the Japanese policymakers, struggling to
keep the economic recovery intact.
 Investors interpreted a Group of 20 agreement over the
weekend to shun competitive devaluations as a green light to
resume dollar selling, driving it to a fresh 15-year low against
the yen.
 While the yen is now trading above levels at which the
Japanese authorities intervened last month analysts say the G20
agreement will make it harder for Tokyo to justify another foray
into the currency markets.
 Fresh evidence of the pain inflicted by the yen's strength
came in the form of a media report that Toyota Motor Corp will
revise its expected dollar/yen rate to 80 yen from 90 yen for the
remainder of its business year ending in March, which will slash
operating profit by 150 billion yen ($1.84 billion). A Toyota
spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.
 Acknowledging the pressures, the government last week
downgraded its view of the economy for the first time in more
than a year. The Bank of Japan is also expected to cut its
outlook at a policy meeting this week.
 Analysts expect no significant economic upturn at least until
early next year as the expiration of government subsidies for
low-emission cars is set to hit factory output.
 Kazuo Mizuno, a senior government official in charge of
analysing underlying economic trends, signalled that Japan may be
headed for further weakness in the economy.
 ""Output is expected to fall in July-September (from the
previous quarter) and in October-December, given the expiration
of government subsidies,"" Mizuno told Reuters on Monday.
 ""Seven out of eight times in the past, two straight quarters
of output falls have led to a recession in Japan,"" said Mizuno,
deputy director-general of the Cabinet Office's economic
assessment and policy analysis.
 EXPORTS TO ASIA
 Slowing growth in shipments of cars and steel accounted for
the slowdown in overall export growth, the data showed.
 Annual growth in exports to Asia, which account for more than
half of Japan's total exports, slowed to 14.3 percent from 18
percent in August to its slowest pace since November 2009,
showing that Japan is getting less support from fast-growing
Asian economies.
 Shipments to China, Japan's largest trading partner, were up
10.3 percent, also the slowest annual rise since November.
 Exports to the United States rose 10.4 percent in September
from a year earlier, while Europe took in 11.2 percent more of
Japanese goods than a year earlier, the data showed.
 The slowing trend will likely keep market expectations alive
for further monetary easing by the BOJ. The central bank is
expected to stand pat on policy at its rate review on Thursday
but its more solemn view of the future will leave the door open
for further action later this year.

1361,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2010 07:08PM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-IMF power shift opens way for more breakthroughs," * Deal moves voting power to China, other emerging nations
 * Geithner flies to China ahead of Seoul summit
 By Lesley Wroughton
 WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - A G20 agreement to give
emerging market countries more power in the International
Monetary Fund opens the door for breakthroughs on easing global
tensions over trade imbalances.
 The surprise deal reached at weekend meetings of finance
ministers from the Group of 20 in South Korea shifts IMF voting
power to under-represented emerging countries like China,
India, Brazil and Turkey.
 Countries like the United States are betting that with
greater representation emerging economies such as China will be
more willing to address the trade distortions causing currency
volatility and threatening increased protectionism.
 The deal avoided a widening of the gulf between emerging
and developed nations and a chaotic ending to a G20 meeting in
which the United States failed to convince China and others to
agree to targets to limit current account imbalances.
 The IMF agreement also spares the G20 from losing
credibility, opening the way for G20 heads of state, meeting in
Seoul on Nov. 11 and 12, to handle more politically difficult
decisions on fixing the trade imbalance problem.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner flew to China on
Sunday for further talks with Chinese authorities in the hopes
of finalizing a currency deal before the Seoul summit.
 Youssef Boutros-Ghali, Egypt's finance minister who heads
the IMF's steering policy panel, the International Monetary and
Financial Committee, said problems in the world economy could
not be addressed without acknowledging the rising clout of
emerging economies.
 ""This deal was necessary for us to get anywhere. This was a
necessary condition, not a sufficient condition, for any
further reform of the institution,"" he told Reuters by phone.
 ""Nobody got exactly what he wanted and nobody is going home
with what he wished, but everybody walks home with a viable
solution,"" said Boutros-Ghali, who attended the G20 meeting in
Gyeongju.
 Just hours after ministers signaled a deal was unlikely and
would be left to G20 leaders summit in Seoul on Nov. 12, IMF
chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn declared a historic agreement had
been reached.
 Analysts said the deal was fairly similar to what ministers
were unable to agree just two weeks earlier at IMF meetings in
Washington and questioned what had triggered the about-turn.
 ""It raises a possibility there may be another side to this
deal,"" said Domenico Lombardi, a former IMF board official and
now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank in
Washington. ""It implies some sort of a commitment from emerging
economies in terms of rebalancing the current accounts or in
terms of greater exchange rate flexibility.""
 The G20 communique on Saturday called for more
market-determined exchange rate systems and the avoidance of
competitive devaluations of currencies but failed to get into
specifics.
 HOLDING OUT FOR BETTER DEAL
 G20 officials said the breakthrough IMF deal came during a
separate meeting of BRIC countries -- China, Russia, India and
Brazil -- and the Group of Seven industrial nations made up of
the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Canada and
Germany.
 One official said Russia and Brazil argued the deal did not
go far enough in shifting power to emerging economies, India
was more conciliatory, while Turkey complained there was no
deadline on achieving the shift.
 In the end, the grand bargain transfers six percent of
voting power to under-represented ""dynamic"" emerging economies,
putting China below the United States and Japan in IMF voting
power from sixth place. The changes will also see Europe give
up two seats to emerging economies on the 24-member IMF board.
 Analysts said the deal will increase the legitimacy of the
IMF at a time when it is set to play a larger role in policing
the global economy.
 The IMF showed during the global financial crisis that it
was an effective lender of last resort, but it still has to
show its persuading powers on thornier issues, such as foreign
exchange policies and current account imbalances.
 Analysts said there were no guarantees that by giving
emerging market economies more IMF voting power and stepping up
IMF oversight of the world economy it will force them to change
their policies.
 ""The lack of an enforcement mechanism makes it unlikely,
however, that the enhanced surveillance procedures will work in
getting countries to shift their policies -- this approach has
been tried before and did not work,"" said Eswar Prasad, a
former IMF official and now a senior fellow at Brookings
Institution.
""The threat of 'additional surveillance' is unlikely to
convince large countries to change their policies,"" he added.

1362,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2010 02:48PM ET</span>",U.S. Senate unlikely to follow House on China yuan," * G20 currency promise buys time for diplomatic efforts
 * Currency legislation to be left to next U.S. Congress
 By Donna Smith
 WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate is unlikely
to take up pending China currency legislation following a
weekend promise by the Group of 20 economic powers to shun
currency devaluations for trade advantage, analysts said on
Sunday.
 Finance ministers from G20 leading and emerging economies
agreed at a weekend meeting in South Korea to ""refrain from
competitive devaluations"" of their currencies and to pursue a
full range of policies to reduce excessive external
imbalances.
 Congressional elections will be held in the United States
on Nov. 2, and only a few weeks are planned for a post-election
session in which the U.S. Congress has to tackle major spending
and income tax issues.
 There was little chance even before the G20 meeting that
the Senate was going to act on legislation passed by the House
of Representatives aimed at pressuring China to raise the value
of its currency.
 But pressure to act has been mounting from some lawmakers
and U.S. manufacturers hurt by China's trade advantages and it
has been an issue in some election campaigns in industrial
states like Pennsylvania. The G20 agreement buys U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner some time to pursue a diplomatic
approach with Beijing over the value of the yuan.
 ""I think he bought some time with the Congress,"" said
Donald Straszheim, senior managing director for China research
at ISI Group in Los Angeles. ""The Senate isn't going to take
this up in a lame duck session. There is just too much
potentially to lose and not enough to gain. They'll leave this
until the next Congress.""
 The Nov. 2 elections will determine which party controls
the next Congress, which will be seated in January. Republicans
are poised to make big gains and possibly take control of the
House. Democrats are likely to retain slim control of the
Senate with Republicans expected to pick up a number of seats.
 ""I don't think they (the Senate) are ever going to take it
(the China currency legislation) up,"" said Paul J. Markowski of
Global Strategies-Analysis Group/MES Advisers, a New York
consulting group.
 ACTION WILL TAKE TIME
 Geithner, who met briefly on Sunday with Vice Premier Wang
Qishan in eastern China, may have secured some promises from
the Chinese to take action on its currency but it will take
time, Markowski said.
 The main aim of the two days of finance minister talks,
which precede a G20 summit in Seoul on Nov. 11-12, was to ease
the currency strains that some economists feared could escalate
into trade wars.
 U.S. officials said they were pleased with the main points
of the G20 agreement -- although it stopped short of setting
any targets to reduce trade imbalances.
 There was little reaction on Sunday from lawmakers who
claim China's yuan is misaligned in value, distorting trade and
stealing U.S. jobs.
 But a spokesman for Senator Debbie Stabenow said the
Michigan Democrat would push to pass the currency legislation.
 ""We must hold China accountable and stop currency
manipulation which hurts Michigan businesses and workers,""
spokesman Matt Williams said.
 The House-passed legislation would threaten China with
tariffs on some of its goods unless there was significant
upward movement in the value of the yuan.
 A number of international analysts have said threatening
China would be counterproductive and Geithner has pursued a
more diplomatic approach, trying to convince Beijing it would
be in its own best interest to adopt a market-based currency
regime.

 * Sniping on sidelines shows fragility of consensus
 By Alan Wheatley, Global Economics Correspondent
 GYEONGJU, South Korea, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Excited talk of
currency wars has given way to an uneasy truce, but what has so
far been a phoney war could yet break out into outright
hostilities.
 The statement thrashed out among finance ministers of the
Group of 20 leading economies in South Korea at the weekend did
no more than paper over the radically different views of the two
main belligerents -- the United States and China.
 Sometimes international meetings sow the seeds of
understandings that, over time, bear policy fruit. But most
times what you see is what you get.
 And what world markets saw in Gyeongju was two countries
poles apart on who is responsible for global imbalances that are
generating currency volatility and threaten to spill over into
1930s-style protectionism -- at a time when the world economic
recovery, in the words of the G20, is ""fragile and uneven"".
 ""On the currencies, I would have liked to have seen more
substantive progress there,"" said Canadian Finance Minister Jim
Flaherty.
 ""We did make directional progress,"" he said, but added:
""There was a lot of push back from China and some of the other
countries as well. I think there's nervousness about the
fragility of the economic recovery.""
 Washington pressed its case that countries with big
external surpluses, primarily China, need to let their
currencies rise.
 The result? A call in the communique for more
market-determined exchange rate systems, the avoidance of
competitive devaluations and the pursuit of a full suite of
policies to reduce current account imbalances.
 Developing economies countered with criticism of rich
countries for cranking up their money-printing presses and, in
the process, sending a flood of money into their markets that is
inflating asset bubbles and forcing up their exchange rates to
the detriment of export industries on which they rely for
growth.
 The result? A promise in the closing statement that
countries that issue reserve currencies -- code principally for
the United States -- would be vigilant against excessive
volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates.
 ""The outcome of the G20 meeting clearly shows progress in
the global rebalancing policy debate,"" said Thomas Stolper,
chief currency strategist at Goldman Sachs in London.
 ""At the same time, this is not a Plaza-style statement that
signals a broad agreement on the role currencies have to play in
the global rebalancing,"" he added, referring to the 1985 Plaza
Accord by five leading nations to drive down the dollar.
 
 REPRESENTATION AND RESPONSIBILITY
 Chris Turner, head of FX strategy at ING Commercial Banking
in London, argued that the G20 surpassed market expectations by
delivering a comprehensive set of reforms: Washington had
pledged not to devalue the dollar in return for an agreement by
emerging market (EM) economies to let their currencies
appreciate.
 Seen through this prism, a surprise agreement to transfer
six percent of voting power at the International Monetary Fund
to developing countries is part of a grand bargain.
 ""The U.S. now argues that with greater representation comes
greater responsibility. Thus EM nations should allow their
currencies to trade more freely,"" Turner said in a note.
 Yet it did not feel in Gyeongju that a new era in global
cooperation was dawning.
 Chinese Finance Minister Xie Xuren demanded that rich
countries implement responsible policies; German Economy
Minister Rainer Bruederle said quantitative easing by the
Federal Reserve was tantamount to manipulating the dollar's
exchange rate.
 There was also a cool reception to U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner's initiative to limit current account
imbalances to four percent of gross domestic product.
 India, Russia, Japan and Germany, as well as China, the
target of Geithner's tactic, all rebuffed the proposal.
 U.S. officials proclaimed themselves pleased that floating
the idea of target ranges for imbalances had switched the focus
of the debate from the narrow issue of the yuan's exchange rate.
 But Canada's Flaherty was not alone in saying he was ""not
overly optimistic"" that G20 leaders would reach agreement on
more detailed targets at their Nov. 11-12 summit in Seoul.
 ""Other countries make the point that there are very
particular national circumstances, so a single number applied to
all countries may not be appropriate,"" George Osborne, Britain's
finance minister, said.
 
 SUCCESS FOR G20?
 While there was evidence of progress in some key areas, the
final communique showed all the signs of a ""weak compromise
between competing interests"", according to Gareth Barry, a
currency strategist with UBS in Singapore.
 If not much changes as a result of Gyeongju, questions are
bound to be asked again whether a group as disparate as the G20
can be a cohesive steering committee for the global economy.
 Boosters note approvingly that the group, for the first
time, grasped the nettle of exchange rates.
 ""To my mind, today's achievements show that G20 can
deliver,"" said Olli Rehn, the European Union's economic and
monetary affairs commissioner.
 Sceptics noted that the landmark deal to redistribute power
at the IMF was clinched not at a G20 plenary but at a meeting of
the Group of Seven rich countries plus Brazil, Russia, India and
China -- the BRICs.
 Still, Angel Gurria, invited to Gyeongju as head of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, was
adamant that IMF reform and a recent accord on new global bank
capital rules would have been impossible without the G20.
 ""This agreement is a great vote of confidence of the G20,""
Gurria said of the new IMF voting power pact.
 The members of the G20, which together account for more than
80 percent of the world economy, had made great strides in their
capacity to communicate within the group, he said.
 ""There is growing comfort zone which has been created even
to discuss some rather complex and uncomfortable issues,"" Gurria
added. ""The G20 provides a good balance between legitimacy and
the capacity to take decisions and to make the decisions stick.""

 * Fresh Fed action still in spotlight
 * No new drivers for oil
 
 By Amanda Cooper and Barbara Lewis
 LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Copper, oil and other
growth-linked commodities may benefit this week from the G20's
hardened stance towards exchange rates, but anticipation of more
U.S. policy easing is likely to remain in the spotlight.
 The Group of 20 major economies agreed on Saturday to shun
competitive currency devaluations but stopped short of setting
targets to reduce trade imbalances that are clouding global
growth prospects.
This consensus could prove positive for risk assets,
although the meeting yielded no major policy iniative and
nothing close to the grand bargain in which participants would
agree to allow their currencies to appreciate that some more
optimistic market watchers were hoping for.
 ""There's some token partnership in working together, but
there's nothing formal that's going to change the amount of
liquidity,"" said Patrick Armstrong, a fund manager with
Armstrong Investment Managers
 ""The same forces that have been driving commodities up over
recent months will remain and countries will continue with
short-term thinking about trying to give themselves competitive
advantages.""
 For the commodities complex, much will depend how the
outcome of the G20 is viewed by the foreign exchange markets.
 The possibility of an all-out currency war that could, in
turn, have triggered greater protectionism and further weighed
on global growth, seems to have been averted for now, which
could embolden investors to take on more risk at the expense of
perceived safe havens such as gold.
 
 QE2 IN FOCUS
 But the prospect of mass-scale bond purchases that most
expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to detail at its next policy
meeting on Nov. 2 and 3 could prove a more powerful driving
force for the markets.
 ""There are fundamentals of supply and demand in various of
these base metals, but what's really driving the markets these
days is what the dollar is doing,"" said Gary Mead, an analyst
with Virtual Metals.
 ""I'm afraid I take a rather dim view of these meetings
anyway. I think they are generally quite promising ... and then
don't translate into any hard action,"" he said. ""Everybody
expects ... the U.S. to do its second round of quantitative
easing, so the question is to what extent that expectation is
going to drive things, much more than what the G20 says.""
 Gold is now around 4.5 percent below the record high struck
at $1,387.10 an ounce on Oct. 14 after the U.S. dollar rose last
week for the first time in five weeks.
 Yet the price is still on track for a 21 percent gain this
year, largely as a result of investor concern over the European
sovereign debt crisis, slowing U.S. growth and the risk of
China's economy overheating.
 The gold price ended last week with a 2.3 percent loss,
marking its first week of decline since early August as the
strength in the dollar eroded investor appetite for non-yielding
assets and other dollar-priced commodities.
Virtual Metals' Mead said copper could build on Friday's
gains, supported by evidence of demand continuing to outpace
supply. This tighter fundamental backdrop coupled with the
recent weakness in the dollar has pushed London Metal Exchange
copper futures to their highest in over two years.
 Three-months LME copper futures ended last week with a 0.8
percent loss at $8,334 a tonne.
 
 NOD TO EMERGING POWER
 At the meeting in South Korea, G20 finance ministers
recognised the quickening shift in economic power away from
Western nations by inking a surprise deal to give emerging
nations a bigger voice in the International Monetary Fund.
 Raw materials such as copper and oil depend heavily on
demand from emerging economies, and in particular China, the
world's top consumer of a number of key commodities.
 ""There was not that much expected out of it. There was
always a risk of it bringing a surprise and they managed to
provide a surprise with the IMF (two seats),"" said Olivier
Jakob, an analyst with Petromatrix.
 ""That's a surprise, but it does not really do anything to
trading the dollar next week,"" he said, adding: ""Oil market
supply and demand are relatively well-balanced. It's going to be
difficult for crude oil to move higher if there is not continued
support from the correlation with the dollar.""
 International benchmark U.S. crude oil has traded in a
mostly $70-$85 range all year. It began rising towards the top
of that range in September and this month hit five-month highs
above $84 a barrel in response to expectations of further
quantitative easing and a falling dollar.
 Analysts say without the dollar effect, the market would
have been under pressure from high levels of inventory in the
United States, the world's biggest oil burner.

Secretary Timothy Geithner said China will continue to move
toward exchange rate flexibility and is now actively engaged on
global foreign exchange issues.
 Geithner, in an interview with Bloomberg Television after
Group of 20 finance leader meetings concluded here on Saturday,
said China views a higher yuan rate versus the dollar as in
Beijing's interest because it does not want the U.S. Federal
Reserve to control its monetary policy.
 ""They're an independent country, a large economy. They need
the flexibility to run their policies in a way that makes sense
for China,"" Geithner said.
 ""And that requires that their exchange rate move up over
time as they're now doing and we want to see that continue.
They've got a ways to go but I think they're committed to do
that,"" he said.
 ""I think you're going to see them continue to move.""
Geithner's comments in the interview came hours before he
travelled to Qingdao, China, to meet with Chinese Vice Premier
Wang Qishan to discuss unspecified bilateral economic matters.
 The U.S. Treasury chief has delayed a decision on whether
to declare that China manipulates its currency for export
advantage. Global economists and U.S. lawmakers contend that
China's yuan is at least 20 percent undervalued.
 The semi-annual Treasury currency report was due on Oct.
15, but Geithner opted to delay it in order to press his case
at multilateral meetings, including Gyeongju and a Nov 5-6 G20
leaders summit in Seoul.
 At the Gyeongju meeting in southeastern Korea, the G20
members pledged to shun competitive currency devaluations and
reduce current account imbalances, though they stopped short of
numerical goals based on percentages of gross domestic product.
 Geithner said it was significant that the G20 directly
addressed currencies with cooperation from China and other key
emerging markets.
 ""We've had a long period where the major economies,
principally Japan, Europe and the United States, bore all the
burden of cooperation on exchange rate questions. They
dominated all those discussions,"" Geithner said.
 ""But the world's changed dramatically and it's very
important that we're discussing these things with China, with
India, with Brazil, with the emerging market economies all
around the world that are growing so rapidly.""
 In the past, Beijing had resisted specific mentions of
currency rates in G20 statements.
 Geithner added that a numerical goal for current account
surpluses and deficits may eventually settle to around 4
percent of GDP.
 ""You've heard people talk about that and my own personal
view is that will become the benchmark for the future,""
Geithner told Bloomberg TV.
 ""That's because if you look at what major economies project
going forward -- what they expect to happen if they pursue the
policy they have been pursuing, most countries see the balances
either staying below 4 percent, or falling to 4 percent over
the medium term.""
 China projects a current account deficit of 4 percent or
less over the next three to five years as its economy grows.
 Turning to complaints about easy U.S. monetary policy,
Geithner said most G20 countries understand the need for the
U.S. to maintain policies to boost growth.
 ""The countries around the room understand that imperative.
They of course recognize that the future growth depends a lot
on how successful we are...in digging out of this hole more
rapidly,"" he said.
 But German Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle criticized the
Federal Reserve's liquidity policies, saying they indirectly
manipulated exchange rates.
 Geithner at a news conference defended the U.S. approach,
saying he backed a strong dollar and did not expect continued
criticism of U.S. monetary policy.
 ""I will take this opportunity to reaffirm once again that
the policy of the United States is to support a strong dollar.
We in the United States recognize the special responsibility
that we have to contribute to global financial stability in
common with development goals as a reserve currency.""

back next week a reform of EU budget rules which introduces new
sanctions for rule-breakers but retains political discretion
over the process, draft conclusions of the EU summit showed.
 The reform, which the European Central Bank, the executive
European Commission and several smaller euro zone countries
wanted to be more ambitious by making the sanctions almost
automatic, was watered down by Germany and France.
 Changes to the rules, the Stability and Growth Pact, are in
a report that the President of the European Council Herman van
Rompuy, who chaired the task force of ministers preparing them,
will present to EU leaders next week.
 ""The European Council endorses the report of the task force
on economic governance,"" draft conclusions of the leaders
summit, obtained by Reuters, said.
 ""The European Council calls for a 'fast track' approach to
be followed, in order for the Council and the European
Parliament to reach agreement on the Commission's legislative
proposals by summer 2011 and to ensure the effective
implementation of the new surveillance arrangements as soon as
possible,"" the draft conclusions said.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said on
Saturday in South Korea that new rules pushed by France and
Germany were too weak to safeguard the euro zone.
 The van Rompuy report says Trichet does not support all the
points in the finance ministers' agreement.
 But EU leaders are likely to praise the reform nonetheless.
 ""Its implementation will allow to increase fiscal
discipline, broaden economic surveillance, deepen coordination,

 ""The result will be a substantial strengthening of the

 By Jana Mlcochova
 PRAGUE, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The leading Czech leftist party
the Social Democrats secured a majority in the parliament's
upper house in an election on Saturday and said it would use the
power to oppose the cabinet's austerity drive.
 The vote, along with a municipal election last weekend, was
seen as the first test for the country's three-party,
centre-right coalition government and its retrenchment plans
opposed by public sector workers.
 ""This election clearly signals that a large part of the
public does not agree with the planned reforms,"" Social
Democrats leader Bohuslava Sobotka told a news conference.
 ""A large part of the reforms are controversial and I think
people came to the election to give the government a clear
signal that they do not agree with its policy and that the
government should change that policy.""
 The cabinet has agreed a 45 billion crown austerity package
to cut the 2011 public sector gap to 4.6 percent of GDP from 5.3
percent expected this year.
 The budget cuts, which include reductions in the public
sector wage bill, and were criticised by trade unions, must come
into force as of January so that the 2011 budget can be applied.
 Sobotka added the Social Democrats would ""object against the
reforms on the Senate floor"".

 Civic Democrats leader and Prime Minister Petr Necas said he
was ready to negotiate with the Social Democrats about the
reforms but admitted there would be a delay.
 ""We have to openly admit that the legislative process will
be longer and more complicated, that's a reality,"" he said.
 Voting for a third of the 81 seats in the parliament's upper
house helped the Social Democrats win a 41-seat majority in the
chamber by winning 12 of the 27 open seats.
 The main rightist party the Civic Democrats, which leads the
cabinet, lost 11 seats, shrinking their ranks in the upper house
to 25 seats.
 The other two coalition partners performed poorly. The
conservative TOP09 lost four seats to keep three, and the
centrist Public Affairs won no seat and have no senator in the
chamber.
 The left-controlled upper house will probably reject the
cuts but the lower house, in which the government coalition
parties hold 118 of 200 seats, can override Senate vetoes.
 The Senate can delay bills by up to 30 days before returning
them to the lower house and analysts said approval of the bills
in January meant no serious threat for the budget, only some
delay.
 ""The Social Democrats could delay approval of the
legislation needed for the budget, there can be a
procrastination possibly until January,"" said Michal Klima,
political scientist at Metropolitan University in Prague.
 ""But otherwise, the Senate is (only) a kind of a safety net,
a direct influence on the approval of the budget ... is not
among its roles."" 
 The government needs a Senate approval on issues such as
changes in the Constitution or sending troops to NATO missions
abroad, in which the lower house does not have the power to
outvote the Senate.
 The centre-right parties won the May parliamentary election
on retrenchment pledges to ease the state deficit and debt load,
and to clean up corruption. The coalition has pledged to bring
the gap to within the EU's 3 percent ceiling by 2013.

1374,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2010 09:04AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-What did the G20 meeting achieve?," Oct 25 (Reuters) - The Group of 20 advanced and emerging
economies agreed on Saturday to move towards market-determined
exchange rates and to pursue the full range of policies needed
to reduce excessive external imbalances.

 1) There was what the organisers termed a hardening of the
rhetoric on currencies in the final communique, with a shift to
""market determined"" exchange rates from ""market oriented"" in
the agreement at the previous summit in Toronto. It also called
for countries to avoid ""competitive devaluations"".
[ID:nTOE69M02N]
 This statement, however, fell short of the best that
markets had hoped for in the shape of some commitment by
countries to allow their currencies to appreciate. With the
Bank of Japan for one intervening to weaken its currency, the
outlook is not hopeful.
 All in all, the communique on currencies was in line with
low market expectations.
 2) There was pressure on the United States on quantitative
easing that has flooded the banking sector with liquidity and
pushed hot money into emerging markets. The communique stressed
the responsibility of countries with reserve currencies, i.e.
the United States, to be ""vigilant against excess volatility
and disorderly"". Countries such as Germany publicly criticised
U.S. policy, suggesting tensions remain. [ID:nLDE69M02P]
 3) Although the meeting fell short of satisfying U.S.
demands for firm numerical limits on current account balances,
there will be ""indicative"" targets that should be rolled out at
the meeting of G20 leaders in Seoul next month. These will be
overseen by the IMF, although there is no power to sanction
countries that break the limits.
 4) Enhancing the role of developing countries by giving
them greater voting and quota rights in the International
Monetary Fund could make them share the burden of resolving
global economic problems instead of indulging in unilateral
action. That said, this issue will be difficult to police and
countries from Brazil to South Korea are all taking measures.
[ID:nTOE69M01A]
 That the IMF reforms were agreed at all at this forum was a
big achievement, the organisers said.
 5) While the series of references to an overarching
macro-prudential framework governing fiscal consolidation,
monetary policy, and exchange rate policies was an attempt at a
comprehensive framework, it was light on detail. Optimists say
the framework will be refined and that this is a good starting
point. Pessimists say the communique is just words that are
unlikely to be matched by action.
 6) An agreement to endorse the Financial Stability Board's
proposals on regulation was probably the least contentious area
of the whole meeting. The endorsement of the Basel III rules on
banks' capital and liquidity frameworks represents a major
milestone in the G20's efforts to shore up the financial
system.
 However progress on dealing with too-big-to-fail banks is
still at a an early stage. While there is a broad consensus
that large, globally inter-connected banks should have greater
""loss absorbency"" capacity, there is still no agreement on
which institutions these measures should be applied to.

1379,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2010 05:32AM ET</span>",TEXT - U.S. Treasury Secretary Geithner G20 press remarks," GYEONGJU, South Korea, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Statement by U.S.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner following the end on
Saturday of a two-day meeting of group of 20 finance ministers
and central bank chiefs in South Korea.
 ""We met here against the backdrop of a world economy that is
gradually healing from the damage caused by the financial crisis.
 The world is growing, and overall we believe the recovery
will gradually strengthen in the coming months.
 We still face very substantial economic challenges across the
advanced and developing economies. We need stronger growth in the
major economies.
 Emerging economies are facing the very different challenge of
managing the pressures associated with very strong growth.
 We spent the last few weeks exploring ways to strengthen our
cooperation on exchange rate and other economic policies.
 The most important thing we achieved is agreement on a
framework for curbing excess trade imbalances in the future. Why
this focus on balance, and why is this important?
 ""The world economy is going through a necessary, but
complicated process of adjustment.
 The major economies are all in varying stages of working
through the large financial imbalances - excess borrowing
relative to income, overinvestment in real estate, unsustainable
leverage in the financial sector -- all of which contributed to
the crisis and will slow the pace of recovery.
 Emerging market economies are expanding at a rapid pace, and
are attracting substantial flows of capital.
 If the world is going to be able to grow at a strong,
sustainable pace in the future, if we are going to be successful
in building a more stable global financial system, and if we are
going to be able continue to expand opportunities for trade and
preserve an open trading system, then we need to work to achieve
more balance in the pattern of global growth as we recover from
the crisis.
 This requires a shift in growth strategies by countries that
have traditionally run large trade and current account surpluses,
away from export dependence and toward stronger domestic demand
led growth.
 This entails a range of policy changes, as you can see in the
very broad range of domestic reforms being undertaken by China.
 An important part of this transition is a gradual
appreciation of emerging market currencies relative to the major
currencies as a group.
 And these changes by surplus economies, both emerging and
advanced, need to be complemented by reforms in countries like
the United States to increase savings--including restoring fiscal
sustainability-- to shift growth from consumption to investment
and to exports.
 The adjustments now underway will happen, but if they happen
in a framework of international cooperation, they will be
achieved with stronger overall global growth rates, less risk of
financial instability, and less protectionist pressures at the
national level.
 The framework of cooperation we agreed to today recognizes
that none of us can accomplish this alone.
 This is inherently a multilateral challenge.
 I want to emphasize three key points:
 ""First, we have agreed that it is important to limit the
overall level of external imbalances across the global economy.
 Those imbalances are lower today than they were before the
crisis. Where they are still high, it is important that we
implement sound policies, consistent with reducing imbalances,
and to prevent them from expanding again to levels that could
threaten future growth and stability.
 Second, we have agreed to cooperate more closely on exchange
rate policy. Countries with significantly undervalued exchange
rates committed to move towards more market-determined
exchange-rate systems that reflect economic fundamentals, as
China is now doing.
 The countries responsible for the dollar, euro and yen
recognized the importance of preserving stability among the major
currencies and avoiding excess volatility and disorderly exchange
rate movements. We all committed to refrain from competitive
devaluation, or undervaluation.
 Together, these commitments should help reduce some of the
pressure being experienced by those emerging economies that are
appropriately running more flexible exchange rate systems and
have already seen their currencies move significantly higher.
 Third, we agreed to give a greater role to the IMF in
implementing these commitments.
 The IMF was created to play this role, but its ability to do
so in practice has been constrained by the reluctance of its
members to expose themselves to a candid, independent, external
assessment of the effects of their policies on the global economy
as a whole, and to allow the IMF staff and management to offer
broad judgments on exchange rate misalignments.
 This must change, and we want to see the IMF act on the
mandate it received here today.
 This is important, for without a strong, independent
mechanism for encouraging cooperation, countries will feel more
pressure to take action on their own to protect their interests.
 The value of this framework to limit trade imbalances is that
rights and responsibilities are aligned and balanced.
 Countries with surpluses and countries with deficits, the
advanced economies and the large emerging economies, all have a
responsibility to play their part in contributing to stronger and
more sustainable growth.
 Alongside these changes, we agreed to a very strong set of
reforms to the International Monetary Fund.
 These changes improve the ability of the IMF to help its
members deal with future crises. They change the governance
structure to give emerging economies a greater voice in the
institution and more seats on the Board.
 I want to acknowledge in particular the willingness of the
Europeans to make this possible by giving up two of their seats.
 Together these reforms recognize that greater representation
for the emerging economies in international institutions comes
with greater responsibilities for making the institutions, and
the global economy, work better.
 We were honored to have South Korea's President Lee Myung-Bak
come to Gyeongju and we appreciate the role of the Korean
presidency in helping us all achieve the concrete outcomes of the
meetings. Thank you.""

 * Says excessive money supply increase manipulates FX rate
 (Adds quotes)
 GYEONGJU, South Korea, Oct 23 (Reuters) - German Economy
Minister Rainer Bruederle on Saturday took issue with what he
called a U.S. policy of increasing liquidity, saying it
indirectly manipulated exchange rates.
 The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to embark on a
fresh round of asset purchases to prop up the economy.
 ""There was criticism of the American policy of monetary
easing, or creating more liquidity,"" Bruederle said after a
meeting in South Korea of finance officials from the Group of 20
economic powers.
 ""I tried to make clear in my contribution to the discussion
that I regard that as the wrong way to go,"" he said. ""An
excessive, permanent increase in money is, in my view, an
indirect manipulation of the (foreign exchange) rate.""
 Foreign exchange rates should be determined by markets, said
Bruederle, who was attending the G20 meeting in place of
Germany's hospitalised finance minister.
 Bruederle said he was positively surprised by the results of
the meeting, which he said surpassed expectations.
 There were intensive discussions at the meeting about a
letter from the U.S. Treasury Secretary calling for action in
tackling foreign exchange and trade imbalances, Bruederle said.
 Geithner's focus was on China, but Germany, Japan and Korea
were also in focus, Bruederle said, adding that he regarded the
U.S. plans as having ""planned economy elements"".
 Bundesbank President Axel Weber, who is also a member of the
European Central Bank's Governing Council, said regulators were
in the final stages of bank regulatory reform and it was now up
to lawmakers to implement the new rules soon.
 Solutions were still needed for dealing with system-relevant
banks, Weber said, adding that these should include an orderly
insolvency mechanism.
 The Financial Stability Board (FSB) should make proposals for
dealing with such system-relevant banks by next summer at the
latest, Weber added.

 The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) was set up
this year to borrow cash on the market against up to 440
billion euros of joint euro zone government guarantees to help
any zone member unable to finance itself in the markets.

Klaus Regling said in Italy's daily La Stampa.
 ""Interest rate differentials have fallen, the euro is
stable and markets have improved. The targeted states have
launched credible improvements. There has been an improvement
in the economy and competitiveness,"" he said.
 Asked the daily about a roadshow for the EFSF in America
and Asia, Regling, a former senior European Commission economic
official, said it was not a roadshow because the EFSF had
nothing to sell apart from its name.
 ""The logic is that if the worst should happen, we would
know who the potential buyers (for EFSF bonds) would be. There
is a lot of interest in us and Europe,"" he said.
 Any offering of EFSF bonds would be in situations of tense
markets when investors would look for triple A paper, he said.
 Getting rating agencies to give the EFSF a triple A rating
had been ""harder than expected. In the past, Europe, me
included, have accused the agencies of giving Triple A rating
lightly. Perhaps they wanted to demonstrate it is not true.""
 Asked about the EU's planned stronger public finance
controls, he said automatic sanctions against errant states

 * China to jump to No. 3 spot in 187-strong Fund
 * Dynamic emerging economies to get 6 pct more power
 * G20 agrees to double IMF quotas
(Adds Russian and South Korean reaction)
 By Luciana Lopez and Alan Wheatley
 GYEONGJU, South Korea, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Fast-growing
emerging economies will get more clout at the International
Monetary Fund under a landmark agreement clinched on Saturday
that reflects a shift in global power from industrial countries.
 Under the deal, more than 6 percent of voting shares at the
Fund will shift to dynamic developing countries such as China,
which will become the third-biggest member of the 187-strong
Washington-based lender.
 Europe will give up two of the eight or nine seats it
controls at any given time on the IMF's Executive Board, which
will continue to have 24 members, according to a statement issued
after a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of 20 leading
economies.
 As part of a wide-ranging package, the G20 also agreed to
double the IMF's quotas, which determine how much each country
contributes to the IMF and how much it may borrow from it.
 The quotas currently total about $340 billion. The IMF staff
had argued for a doubling, which it said would put the fund ""in a
strong position to forestall or cope with potential crises in the
coming years"".
 The G20 said the reforms would make the Washington-based
lender ""more effective, credible and legitimate"".
 The governance reforms amount to an overhaul of the global
economic order established when the Fund was set up after World
War Two, prompting IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn
to describe the agreement as historic.
 ""This makes for the biggest reform ever in the governance of
the institution,"" he told reporters.
 The reduction in Europe's representation is less than the
United States was seeking.
 However, Washington, which has a 17.67 percent share of IMF
quotas will retain its veto on the Fund's most important
decisions. These will continue to require a super-majority vote
of 85 percent, according to IMF officials.
 HORSE-TRADING
 The G20 agreed a year ago to transfer at least 5 percent of
voting rights to developing countries such as India and Brazil
whose clout within the Fund has not kept pace with their
emergence as major engines of global growth.
 ""It was a long-expected reform that is really shifting the
balance of power and making space for all economies, including
emerging markets,"" said French Finance Minister Christine
Lagarde.
 China will leapfrog Germany, France and Britain in the Fund's
power rankings, with its quota share rising to 6.19 percent from
3.65 percent. India will be in 8th spot, Russia in 9th and Brazil
in 10th, according to the Russian finance ministry.
 Together, the four -- known by the acronym BRICs -- will have
14.18 percent of IMF quotas.
 Emerging markets as a whole will have a 42.29 percent share,
which the G20 said was likely to rise further following a
comprehensive review of the quota formula due by January 2013.
 ""This does not complete the reform process,"" Russian Finance
Minister Alexei Kudrin said. ""The position of the emerging market
countries is that this work should be continued.""
 Thrashing out which smaller European countries will give up
their board seats is likely to take a year or more. The G20 set a
final deadline of October 2012. Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands
and Switzerland are among the possible losers.
 The fund's current five biggest members -- the United States,
Japan, Germany, France and Britain -- have their own seats on the
IMF board and are allowed to appoint their executive directors.
 Under Saturday's deal, these directors will now have to be
elected by the full board.
 China, Russia and Saudi Arabia also have their own seats. The
rest of the membership is divided into constituencies, which
elect an executive director to vote for the group as a whole.
 Officials said the Gyeongju Accord could lead to more
multi-member constituencies, and a shake-up of existing ones,
depending on how Europe reduces its representation.
 ""What that essentially means is that all of these
multi-country seats will have to be reshuffled, so there will be
jockeying and coalition-forming,"" said Hyun Song Shin, the top
G20 adviser to South Korea's president.
 There are no set rules governing how countries group
together. Individual countries can switch constituencies in
search of more influence within a group or to form a more
coherent regional alliance.

Executive Board, Strauss-Kahn told reporters during a meeting of
G20 finance ministers.
 The G20 agreed in principle a year ago to transfer at least 5
percent of voting rights to under-represented emerging economies.

 By David Lawder and Yoo Choonsik
 GYEONGJU, South Korea, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The Group of 20
major economies agreed on Saturday to shun competitive currency
devaluations but stopped short of setting targets to reduce trade
imbalances that are clouding global growth prospects.
 At a meeting in South Korea, G20 finance ministers recognised
the quickening shift in economic power away from Western
industrial nations by striking a surprise deal to give emerging
nations a bigger voice in the International Monetary Fund.
 A closing communique contained no major policy initiative
after a U.S. proposal to limit current account imbalances to 4
percent of gross domestic product, a measure aimed squarely at
shrinking China's surplus, failed to win broad enough backing.
 Indeed, the United States itself came under fire from Germany
and China for the super-loose monetary policy stance it has
adopted to try to breathe life into the sluggish U.S. economy.
 German Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle said he had made
clear that easing was the wrong way to go.
 ""An excessive, permanent increase in money is, in my view, an
indirect manipulation of the (foreign exchange) rate,"" he said.
 HEADING FOR CHINA
 The main aim of the two days of talks, which precede a G20
summit in Seoul on Nov. 11-12, was to ease currency strains that
some economists feared could escalate into trade wars.
 Developing countries are worried that Washington, by flooding
the U.S. banking system with cash, is pumping up their asset
prices and exchange rates, thus undermining the competitiveness
of the export industries on which they rely for growth.
 China, among others, frets that the U.S. policy stance will
debase the dollar, the lynchpin of the global economy.
 In a thinly veiled reference to the United States, the G20
statement said advanced countries, including those with reserve
currencies, would be vigilant against excessive volatility and
disorderly movements in exchange rates.
 Washington, by contrast, is frustrated over the refusal of
China in particular to let its currency rise to a level that
reflects its growing economic power and would help reduce its big
trade surplus with the United States.
 ""If the world is going to be able to grow at a strong,
sustainable pace in the future... then we need to work to achieve
more balance in the pattern of global growth as we recover from
the crisis,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said.
 U.S. officials were pleased that the communique committed G20
members to ""refrain from competitive devaluations"" of their
currencies and to pursue a full range of policies to reduce
excessive external imbalances.
 Geithner will keep up the pressure on Sunday for a stronger
yuan when he holds talks in Qingdao, China, with Vice-Premier
Wang Qishan, who has broad responsibility for economic policy.
 ""The content of the G20 statement is generic and broadly in
line with expectations, but this should not detract from the fact
important progress was made in giving emerging market countries a
greater voice in the IMF,"" said Claudio Piron, a currency
strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Singapore.
 IMF SHAKE-UP
 Despite the sniping from Germany and China, whose finance
minister demanded responsible policies from issuers of major
reserve currencies -- code for the United States -- host South
Korea put an optimistic spin on the outcome of the meetings.
 ""This will put an end to the controversy over foreign
exchange rates,"" said Finance Minister Yoon Jeung-hyun.
 South Korea was also able to point to the deal to shift more
than 6 percent of the IMF's quotas -- membership subscriptions
that help determine voting power -- to emerging economies whose
clout in the Fund has not kept pace with their economic ascent.
 Europe will give up two seats on the fund's 24-strong
Executive Board.
 IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn called the
agreement historic. ""This makes for the biggest reform ever in
the governance of the institution,"" he said.
 As part of the agreement, China will overtake traditional
powerhouses Germany, France and Britain to become the third most
powerful member of the IMF, up from sixth spot now. India will
also wield more power in the fund.
 ""Our complaint was that the quota share should reflect ground
reality and economic strengths currently. Otherwise, it would
have eroded the credibility of the institution. That has now been
corrected,"" Indian Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said.

 NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - World stocks and the U.S.
dollar see-sawed on Friday as finance and central bank chiefs
from the Group of 20 leading economies struggled to manage
currency and trade imbalances, leaving investors to navigate
choppy markets
 Uncertainty about the outcome of the G20 meeting, who are
seeking a common path to manage global trade, prompted some
investors to moderate their dollar-selling until the gathering
in South Korea ends this weekend.
 On Wall Street, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rose while the
Dow fell. European shares closed slightly off six-month highs
touched in the previous session.
 The greenback, while ending the day slightly lower, did
snap a five-week losing streak against major currencies.
 The United States struggled on Friday to win backing for a
proposal to set limits on external imbalances as a way of
pressing countries with surpluses such as China to let their
exchange rates rise. For details see: [ID:nTOE69L00U]
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner proposed limiting
surpluses and deficits on the current account -- the broadest
measure of trade in goods and services -- to 4 percent of gross
domestic product, according to Japan's finance minister.
 But the plan met with a cool reception, and big exporting
countries, including Germany, that habitually run chunky trade
surpluses led the opposition. [ID:nLDE69L159]
 Many emerging market policy-makers blame lax U.S. policies
for the global financial crisis, and they fear Washington is
prepared to debase the dollar by flooding the banking system
with cash to try to breathe life into a sluggish U.S. economy.
 ""Once we get past the G20 event, we're going to have that
renewed focus on what's going on with the U.S. quantitative
easing and another down leg in the U.S. dollar,"" said David
Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in
Toronto.
 ""There's the possibility of a renewed upswing in the euro,""
said Watt.
 Traders said large bets against the U.S. currency pointed
to a correction. But they noted they would not rule out another
lurch lower for the dollar, which has fallen about 7 percent
against currencies over the past month.
 The dollar's early strength faded by the end of the day,
slipping 0.06 percent against a basket of major trading-partner
currencies <.DXY> but it is up 0.52 percent this week, its
first weekly gain since mid-September.
 The euro  rose 0.22 percent to $1.3950, and against
the Japanese yen, the dollar  was flat at 81.35.

 On Wall Street, technology shares edged higher as results
from Baidu Inc  and SanDisk  bolstered the
sector's outlook, while the broader market was little changed.

 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 14.01 points,
or 0.13 percent, to end at 11,132.56. But the Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> rose 2.82 points, or 0.24 percent, to
1,183.08. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> gained 19.72
points, or 0.80 percent, to close at 2,479.39.
 While the Dow fell on Friday, all three indexes closed
higher for a third straight week.
 European shares closed down, with the FTSEurofirst 300
<.FTEU3> index of top European shares falling 0.35 percent to
end at 1,089.45 points.
 Consumer-related stocks, which had surged earlier in the
week, were among the biggest losers. LVMH  lost 0.8
percent and L'Oreal  surrendered 1.9 percent.
 ""Earnings have been pretty good and a lot of stocks rose
this week on the back of this, so people are using the excuse
of currency tensions with the G20 meeting to cash in profits,""
said David Thebault, head of quantitative sales trading, at
Global Equities, in Paris.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The dollar was on track on
Friday to snap a five-week losing streak against major
currencies on uncertainty ahead of the outcome of a meeting of
global finance ministers and as the euro repeatedly ran into
resistance above $1.40.
 Extreme bets against the greenback also prompted investors
to moderate their dollar selling. The dollar has lost some 7
percent against a basket of major currencies during a five-week
swoon. It was up 0.6 percent this week, on pace for its first
weekly gain since mid-September.
 Currency speculators further reduced bets against the U.S.
dollar in the week ended Tuesday, data from the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission showed, with the value of net short
U.S. dollar positions down to $25.8 billion from $29 billion.
See
 Once a G20 meeting on currency imbalances is out of the way
the greenback will fight an uphill battle, analysts said.
 The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce more
monetary easing next month, likely through buying U.S. Treasury
debt. The direct purchases would pressure U.S. bond yields and
further diminish the return on dollar-denominated assets.
 ""Once we get past the G20 event, we're going to have that
renewed focus on what's going on with the U.S. quantitative
easing and another down leg in the U.S. dollar,"" said David
Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in
Toronto. ""There's the possibility of a renewed upswing in the
euro.""
 The euro was last little changed at $1.3935, off a session
peak of $1.3973, according to trading platform EBS. The euro is
up 9 percent against the dollar since September, though it has
failed to hold ground on several occasions above $1.40.
 Near-term resistance comes in at last week's high of
$1.4161, which is followed by $1.4376, the 76.4 percent
retracement of the euro's fall from November to June.
 G20 finance and central bank chiefs meet on Friday and
Saturday in South Korea, and a G20 source said officials were
unlikely to reach an accord rejecting currency devaluations and
capping current account balances, after U.S. proposals ran into
stiff opposition. See
 A failure to reach agreement could free traders to keep
selling dollars in favor of the euro, emerging market and
commodity-linked currencies, such as the Australian dollar.
 ""A new currency accord will be hard to achieve in principle
and even harder to push through in practice over the hurdles of
domestic political pragmatism,"" said Lena Komileva, head of G7
market economics at Tullett Prebon.
 EURO NEAR PEAK?
 Interest rate spreads have continued to move in favor of
the euro in recent days, with U.S. yields falling as yields on
German government debt rise. The move was driven in part by
expectations that euro-zone countries are planning to tighten
policies, even as the Fed is set to ease further.
 But eventually growth differentials may shift in the
dollar's favor if Fed policy perks up the economy in early
2011, just as euro-zone governments begin to slash spending and
raise taxes to get public spending in order.
 John Taylor, chief investment officer of FX Concepts,
expects the euro to peak between $1.43 and $1.45 and says it
could sink to parity with the dollar in 2011.
 ""I just don't see all this bullishness on the euro. I don't
think talk about exit strategies from the (European Central
Bank) is right,"" said Taylor, who oversees the world's largest
currency hedge fund with about $8.5 billion under management.
 Some traders said the euro will likely stay in its recent
range of between $1.3650 and $1.4150 in the near term as
investors wrestle with uncertainty over the size of expected
U.S. monetary easing program.
 Mark McCormick, strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in
New York, said the euro's five-day and 20-day moving averages
against the dollar are converging, a bearish short-term sign.
Traders also said a weekly close below $1.3929, the euro's
200-week moving average, would signal dollar gains.
 The dollar was flat at 81.34 yen, not far from a 15-year
low of 80.84 yen set earlier this week.

 ""You've got the sense that the U.S. is basically out there

Those sort of issues have been providing some support for the

 ""The bulk of the work for the G20 and the G20 communique is
not going to be finalized until the weekend so the markets are
prepared for, well, just in case there's an agreement, we don't

 But Watt added the market was cautious in general about
what's going to happen with currencies, given speculation the
Federal Reserve will announce more monetary easing next month,
likely through direct purchases of U.S. Treasury debt.

down 1.5 percent for the week.

data showing Canadian retail sales in August beat expectations.

 ""There was a revision higher as well to the July numbers.
It's a bit stale coming from the summer, but still it's a
positive print for Canada as our data has been a bit uneven
lately, so this is a positive piece in terms of updating us on
where the consumer sits.""
 Economists said Friday's September inflation data, which
was largely muted, was unlikely to strengthen the resolve of
those who think the Bank of Canada will begin to raise interest
rates soon.
 The central bank paused on rate increases earlier this
week, and said that it would have to consider any further rate
hikes carefully, given the patchy global recovery.

1397,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2010 04:52PM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Austerity measures around the euro zone," Oct 22 (Reuters) - The French Senate approved an unpopular
pension reform on Friday in a victory for President Nicolas
Sarkozy, although unions opposed to raising the retirement age
have vowed to keep fighting it.
 The broader measures Sarkozy is pushing through to cut the
deficit are far milder than in countries such as Britain, which
unveiled 80 billion pounds ($126 billion) in spending cuts this
week.
 Here are details of some austerity measures around the euro
zone:
 * FRANCE:
 -- Plans to raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60
by 2018, make people work longer for a full pension and raise
public sector contributions to private sector levels. Prime
Minister Francois Fillon has ruled out any retreat on his
government's plans. France's six main unions have called two
more days of action on Oct. 28 and Nov. 6 against the unpopular
reform.
 -- The government is aiming to cut the public deficit to 6
percent of gross domestic product in 2011 from 7.7 percent in
2010, in the first phase of a plan to trim the shortfall to the
EU's 3 percent ceiling in 2013, and 2 percent in 2014.
 -- Raising the top marginal rate of tax to 41 percent from
40 percent to fund pension reforms.
 -- Raising the tax on capital gains by one percentage point.
 -- The end of a one-off corporate tax break in 2010 will
increase revenues by 5.3 billion euros.
 -- The government aims to raise some 400 million euros from
the sale of property in 2011.
 -- The end of fiscal stimulus measures will cut 8.2 billion
euros from the deficit.

 * PORTUGAL:
 -- Portugal has promised to cut this year's budget deficit
to 7.3 percent of gross domestic product from 9.3 percent last
year and further reduce it to 4.6 percent in 2011. However
the main opposition party set lower tax hikes and more spending
cuts as conditions to pass the bill. 
 
 Here are some of the measures:
 -- Cuts of 5 percent in civil servant wages and increases in
taxes in an effort to save 5.1 billion euros ($6.93 billion)
next year.
 -- On the revenue side, the measures would add 1.7 billion
euros to state coffers, or one percentage point of gross
domestic product. They include:
 -- Value-added tax to be raised by 2 percentage points for
top level to 23 percent from 21 percent, expands on a 1
percentage point increase on all levels implemented in July.
 -- New tax on financial system in line with EU initiatives.
 -- Revision of fiscal benefits for companies.
 
 * GREECE:
 -- Greece unveiled another austerity budget on Oct. 4. The
budget targets a deficit of 7.0 percent of gdp in 2011, from a
project 7.8 percent in 2010 and below an initial 8.1 percent
target under a baseline IMF/EU scenario.
 -- Greece's belt-tightening will continue with next year's
budget relying on property taxes, an amnesty on building
violations, new gambling licences and a one-off tax on
profitable businesses for the third year in a row.
 -- Greek lawmakers have already approved a pension reform
bill which raises the retirement age and curbs early pensions, a
key element of an EU/IMF bailout aimed at pulling the country
out of a debt crisis. For more details, click on
 -- Public sector wages were cut by an average 15 percent in
2010 and will freeze until 2014. Private sector wages were
frozen for this year and will rise in line with euro area
inflation in 2011 and 2012.
 -- The main VAT rate was increased by 4 percentage points to
23 percent. Monday's budget foresees 1 billion euro revenues
from VAT but does not make clear which products and services now
under 11 percent will move to a higher bracket.
 
 * SPAIN:
 -- Spain revealed full details of its 2011 budget on Oct. 7
before parliament, including its estimates for bond issuance in
2011. Announced measures include:
 -- Public spending, excluding autonomous regions, to be cut
by 7.9 percent to 122 billion euros ($165.7 billion) in 2011.
 -- Ministry spending to be cut on average 16 percent
 -- Income tax rate on those earning more than 120,000 euros
rises up to 22.5 percent from 21.5 percent.
 -- Rate on those earnings more than 175,000 euros to rise to
23.5 percent
 -- Government hopes to raise 170-200 million euros from tax
hike on high earners.
 -- Forecasts additional 1.2 billion euros savings from
regional and local governments.
 
 * ITALY:
 -- Although Italy kept its budget deficit down to 5.3
percent of GDP in 2009, well below the EU average, the budget
aims to cut the deficit to 2.7 percent by 2012.
 -- Delaying retirement dates by three to six months, a state
salary freeze and pay cuts for high public sector earners.
 -- Regional and local governments will be pressed to
contribute some 13 billion euros of spending cuts in 2011-2012.
 -- There will be a 10 percent cut per year in 2011 and 2012
in spending by all government ministries. Provincial governments
with less than 220,000 inhabitants will be abolished.
 
 * GERMANY:
 -- Chancellor Angela Merkel said her government aims to save
around 80 billion euros between 2011 and 2014 and get the German
budget deficit below European Union limits by 2013. The cabinet
backed a bill covering the bulk of the 80 billion euro ($101
programme over the next four years on Sept 1.
 -- The budget, before parliament by end of November, will
cut spending to 307.4 billion euros next year, a 3.8 percent
decrease from 2010, and reduce the deficit to 60 billion.
 -- The cabinet agreed a package in June which will cut
welfare spending by 30 billion euros over the period, reduce
public sector payrolls by up to 15,000 by 2014 and raise new
taxes on nuclear power plant operators and air travel.
 -- Hopes to realise 5.5 billion euros through subsidy cuts
and raise 2 billion a year with a financial transaction tax.
 -- Defence ministry experts have drawn up a list of
potential savings worth more than 9.3 billion euros.
 
 * IRELAND:
 -- Ireland has yet to make a decision on the level of budget
cuts it will make next year, the Department of Finance said on
Friday, denying a newspaper report a figure of 4.5 billion euros
had been agreed.
 -- Ireland needs to get the worst fiscal shortfall in Europe
back within a limit of 3 percent of GDP by 2014 and will detail
how it plans to get there by unveiling a four-year budget plan
next month.
 -- Ireland has carried out some of the harshest austerity
measures in the euro zone. Its public sector unions passed a pay
deal in June, ending low-key protests but limiting Dublin's
options in making at least 3 billion euros of savings apiece in
the next two budgets. 
 -- One measure in last December's budget was cutting public
service salaries by 5-15 percent. The budget inflicted 4 billion
euros of cuts. The government has promised no further public
sector pay cuts until 2014.
 -- Ireland said in July that it would cut its budget for
infrastructure projects in 2011 to 5.5 billion euros, generating
1 billion euros of savings, or one-third of the total amount
required in December's budget.

1398,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2010 04:40PM ET</span>",G20 summit in Nov must solve fx tensions - EU," * Document says United States must boost savings
 * Says China must encourage stronger domestic demand 
 * Urges exchange rates to be in line with market fundamentals
 
 By Timothy Heritage
 BRUSSELS, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Leaders of the world's 20
biggest developing and developed economies must solve exchange
rate tensions when they meet in November in Seoul, a European
Commission document showed.
 G20 leaders meet on Nov. 11-12 in Korea to try to put the
world economy on a more stable footing and defuse currency
tensions that economists say could trigger trade wars.
 ""We need a strong action plan coming out of Seoul,"" said the
Commission document, obtained by Reuters, on the preparation for
the G20 summit.
 ""It is key that there will be clear political commitment to
deliver and to provide cooperative and lasting solutions to the
current tensions in particular in currency markets,"" it said.
 ""Countries should also commit to avoid setting exchange
rates at levels not in line with market fundamentals,"" it said.
 While the G20 won praise for coordination of stimulus
packages during the global financial crisis, its unity has been
tested by low growth in rich countries and attempts by some
emerging market economies to preserve export competitiveness by
holding down their exchange rates. 
 Saudi Arabia, Germany and Russia are the G20 members with
the biggest current account surpluses, but fellow member China
is the chief culprit in the eyes of the United States and Europe
because of massive currency market intervention to keep a lid on
the yuan. 
 Beijing has amassed $2.65 trillion in official currency
reserves as a consequence, and prompted the U.S. House of
Representatives to pass a bill threatening retaliation unless
China lets its currency off the leash to reduce its huge trade
surplus with the United States.
 ""All major economies need to do their part to achieve
economic rebalancing,"" the Commission document said. 
 It said that advanced deficit economies, which in G20 jargon
means the United States, should increase their domestic savings
rate while keeping open markets and raising export
competitiveness. 
 It said emerging surplus economies -- a term used to
describe China -- needed to encourage stronger domestic
consumption through better social safety nets and financial
markets, and allow greater flexibility of exchange rate regimes.
 ""We need to step up our efforts to address more systemic
risks, limit the build-up of excessive reserves and as a result
build a more stable and resilient international monetary
system,"" the document said.
 The 27-nation EU will be represented at the November summit
by European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and by the
President of the European Council Herman van Rompuy.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The dollar was on track on
Friday to snap a five-week losing streak against major
currencies on uncertainty ahead of the outcome of a meeting of
global finance ministers and as the euro repeatedly ran into
resistance above $1.40.
 Extreme bets against the greenback also prompted investors
to moderate their dollar selling. The dollar <.DXY> has lost
some 7 percent against a basket of major currencies during a
five-week swoon. It was up 0.6 percent this week, on pace for
its first weekly gain since mid-September.
 Finance and central bank chiefs from the Group of 20 rich
and emerging nations meet on Friday and Saturday in South
Korea, and a G20 source said officials were unlikely to reach
an accord rejecting currency devaluations and capping current
account balances, after U.S. proposals ran into stiff
opposition. See [ID:nLDE69L0JA]
 Analysts said once the G20 meeting is out of the way, the
dollar still will fight an uphill battle, with the Federal
Reserve widely expected to announce more monetary easing next
month, likely through direct purchases of U.S. Treasury debt.
 ""Once we get past the G20 event, we're going to have that
renewed focus on what's going on with the U.S. quantitative
easing and another down leg in the U.S. dollar,"" said David
Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in
Toronto. ""There's the possibility of a renewed upswing in the
euro.""
 The euro  was last little changed at $1.3931, off a
session peak of $1.3973, according to trading platform EBS. The
euro is up 9 percent against the dollar since September, though
it has failed to hold ground for long on several occasions
above $1.40.
 Analysts said a failure to reach agreement would free
traders to keep selling dollars in favor of the euro, emerging
market and commodity-linked currencies, such as the Australian
dollar.
 ""A new currency accord will be hard to achieve in principle
and even harder to push through in practice over the hurdles of
domestic political pragmatism,"" said Lena Komileva, head of G7
market economics at Tullett Prebon.
 The dollar was up 0.1 percent at 81.45 yen , not far
from a 15-year low.
 EURO NEAR PEAK?
 Interest rate spreads have continued to move in favor of
the euro in recent days, with U.S. yields falling as yields on
German government debt rise. The move was driven in part by
expectations that euro-zone countries are planning to tighten
policies, even as the Fed is set to ease further.
 Some traders said the euro will likely stay in its recent
range of between $1.3650 and $1.4150 in the near term as
investors wrestle with uncertainty over the size of expected
U.S. monetary easing program.
 But eventually growth differentials may shift in the
dollar's favor if Fed policy perks up the economy in early
2011, just as euro-zone governments begin to slash spending and
raise taxes to get public spending in order.
 ""Once austerity measures take effect in Europe, the economy
may contract relative to the U.S., a headwind for the euro,""
said Mark McCormick, strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in
New York.
 McCormick said the euro's five-day and 20-day moving
averages against the dollar are converging, a bearish
short-term sign. Traders also said a weekly close below
$1.3929, the euro's 200-week moving average, would signal
dollar gains.
 John Taylor, chief investment officer of FX Concepts,
expects the euro to peak between $1.43 and $1.45 and says it
could sink to parity with the dollar in 2011. [ID:nN22169755]
 ""I just don't see all this bullishness on the euro. I don't
think talk about exit strategies from the (European Central

currency hedge fund with about $8.5 billion under management.

1405,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2010 01:48PM ET</span>",Many poor states still cut off from trade finance," * Trade finance recovery bypasses poor countries
 * Threat to development
 * Regulatory change exacerbates problem
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Many developing countries remain
cut off from trade finance, which before the credit crunch was
often their only source of private-sector funding, despite a
recovery in the industry, a meeting of experts heard on Friday.
 Difficulties still encountered by some poor countries in
Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Central Asia to
obtain funding for their exports threatens to undermine their
entire economic development, one expert said.
 ""For them it's an important lifeline with respect to
development,"" said the expert, requesting anonymity, after the
meeting of commercial and development bankers active in trade
finance hosted by the World Trade Organization.
 Trade finance -- the lifeblood of global commerce -- dried
up in late 2008 and early 2009 amid the broader credit crunch,
contributing to a 12 percent decline in global trade volumes in
2009, the biggest contraction since World War Two.
 The industry, which underpins 60-80 percent of the $12-13
trillion in merchandise trade, has recovered since the G20
agreed at its summit in London in April last year to mobilise up
to $250 billion to revive the sector.
 But even as trade expands by an unprecedented 13.5 percent
this year, banks are concentrating on the safest customers.
 Countries finding it hard to access trade finance include
Vietnam, Pakistan and Bangladesh in Asia, some 20 countries in
Africa, 5 low-income states in central and southern America, and
Ukraine and Kazakhstan, the trade finance expert told reporters.
 WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy is likely to raise the
issue at next month's G20 summit in Seoul and on Oct. 27 when he
attends a meeting of the African Development Bank in Tunis,
trade sources said.
 
 RISK AND REGULATIONS
 Current and proposed regulations are discouraging banks from
providing trade finance to developing countries because they
increase the amount of money banks must set aside to cover
risks, making the low-margin transactions unprofitable.
 ""There comes a point at which the cost of doing business ...
is just not worth it,"" said the trade finance expert.
 Under current banking regulations, known as Basel II, banks
must set aside capital according to the risk of the country they
are lending to, not the corporate customer. In many developing
countries, companies -- especially those selling commodities and
raw materials -- have much better credit ratings than the state.
 Proposed new rules known as Basel III, intended to prevent
banks hiding toxic assets off their balance sheets -- one of the
causes of the financial crisis -- also penalise trade finance
because its traditionally safe instruments such as letters of
credit are held off-balance-sheet.
 The irony is, bankers argue, that trade finance is much
safer than other forms of credit.
 That was long a matter of faith and anecdote, but nine
leading trade finance banks have now pooled data on trade
finance to demonstrate to regulators just how safe it is and
argue for a change in the rules.
 A trade finance default register, set up by the
International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and Asian Development
Bank, collected 5.2 million transactions over 5 years, worth
$2.5 trillion.
 The database shows only 1,140 transactions defaulted -- a
default rate of 0.02 percent, compared with rates of several
percentage points on real estate lending.
 Even in those cases 60 percent of the money was recovered as
trade finance lending is secured on the underlying shipment.
 Banks attending Friday's WTO meeting included BNP Paribas,
Citibank, Commerzbank, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase , RBS, Standard
Chartered and Tokyo-Mitsubishi.

European Union and its former colonies were unable on Friday to
agree how to break an impasse over regional trade accords,
agreeing only on the need for the accords to be sealed soon.
 Efforts to seal accords between the EU and six different
groupings of African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) nations have
been deadlocked for years.
 ""Since 2007 there has been an impasse (in negotiations). We
cannot stay here forever,"" EU trade chief Karel De Gucht told
journalists after meeting with trade and economy ministers from
ACP states.
 African countries in particular -- many of which depend on
customs incomes for their national budgets -- have balked at EU
demands that they replace regional border taxes within their
regional groups with other forms of fiscal income such as VAT.
 ""Europe needs African countries,"" Gabon's Economy and Trade

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - World stocks and the U.S.
dollar see-sawed on Friday before a meeting of the Group of 20
leading economies that kept markets choppy and traders skittish
as they took profits after this week's advance.
 Uncertainty about the outcome of the meeting of G20 finance
ministers, who are seeking a common path to manage global
trade, prompted some investors to moderate their dollar-selling
until the gathering in South Korea ends this weekend.
 On Wall Street, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rose while the
Dow edged lower. But European shares closed slightly off
six-month highs touched in the previous session as the dollar
gained a bit and was on track to snap a five-week losing streak
against major currencies.
 The United States struggled on Friday to win backing for a
proposal to set limits on external imbalances as a way of
pressing countries with surpluses such as China to let their
exchange rates rise. For details see: [ID:nTOE69L00U]
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner proposed limiting
surpluses and deficits on the current account -- the broadest
measure of trade in goods and services -- to 4 percent of gross
domestic product, according to Japan's finance minister.
 But the plan met with a cool reception, and big exporting
countries that habitually run chunky trade surpluses led the
opposition.
 Many emerging market policy-makers blame lax U.S. policies
for the global financial crisis, and they fear Washington is
prepared to debase the dollar by flooding the banking system
with cash to try to breathe life into a sluggish U.S. economy.
 ""It's unlikely the G20 meeting will produce any substantial
clarity regarding the direction of currencies. It will not
prevent the U.S. Federal Reserve from announcing a new round of
quantitative easing,"" said UniCredit analyst Tammo Greetfeld.
 Traders said large bets against the U.S. currency pointed
to a correction. But they noted they would not rule out another
lurch lower for the dollar, which has fallen about 7 percent
against currencies over the past month.
 The dollar rose slightly against major currencies, with the
U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.11 percent at 77.501 and is up
about 0.4 percent this week, its first weekly gain since
mid-September.
 The euro  was barely changed against the dollar at
$1.3922, and against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was up
0.14 percent at 81.45.
 ""The dollar has fallen quite rapidly over the last month or
so and positions are somewhat extended. We saw the tide turning
a bit this week,"" said Nick Bennenbroek, currency strategist at
Wells Fargo in New York.

 * Review not weakening NATO, but military may face more cuts

 By Mohammed Abbas and Rhys Jones
 LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - A major review of British defence
strategy has shrunk military capacity and left the armed forces
vulnerable to further cuts, with much hinging on how long
British troops remain in Afghanistan.
 At eight percent, the defence budget cuts are far below an
average of 19 percent forced on other departments to reduce a
record budget deficit, allaying U.S. and NATO fears and keeping
Britain as one of the strongest military powers in Europe.
 Tuesday's Strategic Defence and Security Review, the first
since 1998, highlighted cyber attacks and terrorism as the
greatest threats to British security, justifying cuts to
hardware used in conventional warfare.
 But a crisis could leave Britain exposed if some of the
capabilities it has scaled back are needed again, not least the
ability to fly jets from aircraft carriers, a decisive factor in
Britain's 1982 war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands.
 Contractual obligations meant the government had to retain
two previously ordered carriers, but Britain will not have
combat jets to fly from them for some 10 years.
 ""It's clear that the government is prepared to take
significant risk in some areas ... It's whether in the risks
they take, they get caught,"" said Andrew Dorman, a senior
lecturer at King's College London's defence department.
 Britain is also hoping it will not have to project
significant military power abroad again in the near future,
given that it has scaled back its fleet of warships and planes
and will commit fewer troops to foreign military interventions.
 Britain's role in Afghanistan, where it has 9,500 troops and
from which it plans to withdraw by 2015, weighed heavily on the
review, and limited cuts to the army and some equipment. 
 ""In important respects, this is a holding review while we're
in Afghanistan,"" said Malcolm Chalmers, a professor at the Royal
United Services Institute thinktank.
 ""If the UK was able to make a massive drawdown of its forces
by 2013, there would be pressure to have a significant review of
commitments before 2015,"" he added.
 
 MORE CUTS?
 The review envisaged a reduction of about eight percent in
real terms to a defence budget of 36.9 billion pound ($58
billion), but it lacked detail on where the axe would fall.
 ""I think you're going to see a whole series of announcements
over the next 18 months which will involve some big decisions.
If some of the efficiency savings aren't made, or they need
further ones, I see big potential cuts to follow,"" Dorman said.
 The question of whether to renew Britain's Trident nuclear
deterrent was postponed, and the prospect of scaling it back
left dangling. A decision on how many Joint Strike Fighter and
Eurofighter combat jets to buy was also put off, as was the
number of armoured vehicles to be bought in a new programme.
 More may become clear when the government consults with
industry to decide a new military industrial strategy by the end
of the year. The strategy will give a clearer picture of what
the defence ministry will buy in future, and what it will scrap.
 
 POLITICS AND POSITION
 Contrary to earlier fears, the review has not seen Britain
slip significantly from its place as one of the most capable
military powers in Europe, roughly on a par with France.
 ""Based on what we have seen the UK will still be highly
capable across the spectrum and remains committed to an active
international engagement,"" said NATO spokesman James Appathurai.
 Politically, the right-leaning Conservative Party, which
flaunts its pro-military credentials, has emerged looking like a
champion of the armed forces, going softer on the defence budget
than that of other government departments.
 The dovish Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives' junior
partner in government, will be pleased at the decision to delay
the renewal of Trident, because it wants an alternative system.
 But the party's failure to keep its promise to prevent a
rise in university tuition fees contrasts with the
Conservatives' success in protecting its military backers.
 ""The Conservatives are making the big calls in the
coalition, pushing their agenda, minimising defence cuts while
fundamentally changing the system of university finance,"" said
Jonathan Tonge, head of politics at Liverpool University.
 ""What looked at least initially as a decent (coalition) deal
for the Liberal Democrats is already beginning to unravel as the
policy agenda of the Conservatives is played out.""

Friday to snap a five-week losing streak against major
currencies as traders took profits ahead of any statement from
a meeting of global finance ministers and the euro repeatedly
ran into technical resistance above $1.40.
 Uncertainty over the outcome of a G20 meeting, where

fighting an uphill battle, traders said. The U.S. Federal
Reserve is expected to announce more monetary easing next
month, likely through direct purchases of U.S. Treasury debt,
while euro-zone governments are planning to tighten fiscal and
monetary policy, making the euro more attractive to inventors.
 Interest rate spreads continued to widen as a result, with
U.S. yields falling as yields on German government debt rise.

 But eventually growth differentials may shift in the

 Still, some analysts said there's room for more euro gains
in the short term, particularly if leaders from the Group of 20
rich and emerging nations fail to make any headway on currency
disagreements at a meeting South Korea.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, in a letter sent
to G20 finance leaders and seen by Reuters, urged countries to
refrain from using exchange rates for economic advantage and to
adopt targets for current account balances.
 But the proposal ran into stiff opposition from Japan,
Germany, China and others.
 Analysts said a failure to reach agreement would free
traders to keep selling dollars in favor of the euro, emerging
market and commodity-linked currencies, such as the Australian
dollar.
 ""A new currency accord will be hard to achieve in principle
and even harder to push through in practice over the hurdles of
domestic political pragmatism,"" said Lena Komileva, head of G7

 By John McCrank and David Ljunggren
 TORONTO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Canada's economic recovery
appears intact, with consumers spending more in stores this
summer, but inflation remains subdued, suggesting interest
rates are on hold until 2011, two reports showed on Friday.
 Retail sales rose a higher than expected 0.5 percent in
August, helped by a rebound in furniture stores and higher
gasoline prices, Statistics Canada said. It also revised its
July retail sales figure to show a 0.1 percent rise versus its
initial estimate of a 0.1 percent drop.
 Earlier, Statscan said the annual inflation rate rose to a
relatively tame 1.9 percent in September, as expected,
prompting analysts to predict the Bank of Canada would keep
interest rates steady for the time being.
 ""The stronger than expected data for retailing, together
with similar news on manufacturing and wholesaling reported
earlier, is a modest negative for fixed-income markets that are
now pricing in a very dovish outlook for the Bank of Canada,""
CIBC World Markets economists Avery Shenfeld and Emanuella
Enenajor said in a note.
 ""Still, with core inflation very tame and the overall
quarter still looking lackluster, the next round of rate hikes
will likely be a few quarters away.""
 Canadian bond prices were little changed following the
reports, while the currency touched a session high of C$1.0224
to the U.S. dollar, or 97.81 U.S. cents, after the retail sales
data. [CAD/]

 Consumer spending was one of the main engines of the
economic recovery earlier in the year, but it faltered in
recent months, partly due to the introduction of new sales tax
regimes in the populous provinces of Ontario and British
Columbia.
 Friday's report showed total sales volumes were up 0.3
percent.
 Gasoline sales rose the most in dollar terms, up 2.1
percent. Furniture and home furnishing stores also saw a 2.1
percent rise, following two months of declines.
 The biggest decrease came in the sporting goods, hobby and
music stores subsector, which was down 1.8 percent.
 Sales of motor vehicles and parts rose 0.7 percent, led by
automotive parts and accessories.
 Still, some analysts said there were elements of weakness
in the report.
 ""The details don't show broad-based gains. Canadians
basically bought cars, filled them with gas to go to the
supermarket and to shop for some home furnishings (which only
partly reversed a record drop). Most other sales categories
were either up a little or down,"" Jonathan Basile,
vice-president, economics, at Credit Suisse Securities said in
a note.
 INFLATION PRESSURES TAME
 Separately, Statistics Canada said higher energy and
transportation costs pushed the consumer price index up to 1.9
percent in September from the 1.7 percent recorded in August.
 The annual core inflation rate, which strips out volatile
items and the effects of tax changes, dropped to 1.5 percent
from 1.6 percent in August. Analysts had expected 1.6 percent.
 The figures are unlikely to alarm the Bank of Canada, which
kept interest rates on hold this week and promised to consider
any future hikes carefully. It predicted both measures of
annual inflation would hit its 2.0 percent target by the end of
2012. [ID:nN22157729]
 ""I don't think it's much in the way of a market mover
simply because of what we already know from the Bank of Canada
this week, and I don't think as well that it's going to have
much of an impact on their near-term thinking,"" said Mark
Chandler of RBC Capital Markets.
 Prices increased in seven of the eight major components of
inflation, with clothing and footwear as the only exception.
Energy prices advanced 5.6 percent during the 12 months to
September, compared with a 5.0 percent rise in August.
 ""Inflation remains tame in Canada, which will allow the
Bank of Canada to stay on hold well into 2011,"" said Robert
Kavcic of BMO Capital Markets.
 Traders are split over when the central bank -- which
raised rates three consecutive times between June and September
-- will move again.
 A Reuters poll of Canada's 12 primary dealers this week
showed five expect the bank to have raised rates at least once
by next March. [CA/POLL]
 Based on a Reuters calculation, the market is pricing in a
97.64 percent chance that rates will remain on hold at the
central bank's Dec. 7 decision .
 Separately, Canada's monthly budget deficit rose in August
from a year earlier as government program expenses and
increased infrastructure spending outweighed a rise in
revenues. [ID:nTOE002170]

 NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - World stocks and the U.S.
dollar wavered on Friday before a meeting of the Group of 20
leading economies that is keeping markets choppy and traders
skittish as they take profits after this week's run-up.
 Uncertainty about the outcome of the meeting of G20 finance
ministers who seek a common path to manage global trade
prompted some investors to moderate their dollar-selling until
the gathering in South Korea ends this weekend.
 Wall Street stocks were little changed and European shares
edged lower from six-month highs as the dollar rose slightly
and was on track to snap a five-week losing streak against
major currencies.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said in a letter
to fellow G20 finance chiefs that countries should refrain from
currency policies designed to gain a competitive edge and
should aim instead to contain trade imbalances. For details see

 Canada said it supported the proposals. However, developing
economies, such as China, may cool to the idea of letting their
currencies strengthen if the U.S. Federal Reserve embarks on an
expected new program to boost money supply.
 ""It's unlikely the G20 meeting will produce any substantial
clarity regarding the direction of currencies. It will not
prevent the U.S. Federal Reserve from announcing a new round of
quantitative easing,"" said UniCredit analyst Tammo Greetfeld.
 While traders would not rule out another lurch lower for
the dollar, which fell about 7 percent against currencies over
the past month, they said large bets against the U.S. currency
pointed to a correction.
 The dollar rose slightly against major currencies, with the
U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.14 percent at 77.538 and is up
about 0.4 percent this week, its first weekly gain since
mid-September.
 The euro  was barely changed against the dollar at
$1.3915, and against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was up
0.01 percent at 81.35.
 ""The dollar has fallen quite rapidly over the last month or
so and positions are somewhat extended. We saw the tide turning
a bit this week,"" said Nick Bennenbroek, currency strategist at
Wells Fargo in New York.
 The Dow was down but the Nasdaq and S&P were slightly
higher.

 * WTO panel to publish ruling by April 2011
 * Dispute predates recent row over rare earths
 GENEVA, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization will
not publish a ruling in a dispute brought against China over
exports of raw materials until next April instead of this year,
a WTO document showed on Friday.
 A statement by the chairman of the panel examining the case,
published on the WTO website, said the panel expected to
complete its work by April 2011.
 The United States, European Union and Mexico launched a
dispute at the WTO last year over their complaint that Chinese
export restrictions on minerals such as bauxite and magnesium
discriminated against foreign manufacturers that use the inputs
and gave an unfair advantage to domestic producers.
 China's export policies for raw materials have caused
heightened concern in businesses in other countries after
reports in recent weeks that China had cut off supplies of rare
earths -- used in high-tech goods from car parts to electronics
-- to Japan during a territorial dispute between the two powers.
 China has about 30 percent of the world's rare earths but is
the world's dominant producer, accounting for over 90 percent of
global supply of the metals.
 Beijing argues that it must restrict the production and
export of the raw materials in the WTO dispute and rare earths
for environmental reasons and to conserve its own resources.
 Germany's industry confederation BDI is holding a congress
on Oct. 26 to discuss security of raw material supplies in
Germany and Europe, where rare earths are certain to be a major
topic.
 Under WTO rules, a panel should normally publish its ruling
on a dispute within six months of being formed. The WTO agreed
to set up the panel in December 2009, and its membership was
agreed at the end of March this year.
 The panel gave no reason for the delay but said it had been
agreed with the parties to the dispute.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The dollar was on track Friday
to snap a five-week losing streak against major currencies as
traders took profits and the euro repeatedly ran into technical
resistance above $1.40.
 Uncertainty over the outcome of a G20 finance ministers'
meeting, where exchange rate policies were on the agenda, also
prompted investors to moderate their dollar selling until the
gathering in South Korea ends over the weekend.
 While traders would not rule out another lurch lower for
the U.S. currency, they said extreme bets against the greenback
pointed to a correction. The dollar has lost some 7 percent
against a basket of major currencies during a five-week swoon.
 Though down slightly against the euro and yen on Friday,
the dollar index was up 0.4 percent since Monday, aiming for
its first weekly gain since mid-September.
 ""The dollar has fallen quite rapidly over the last month or
so, and positions are somewhat extended, and we saw the tide
turning a bit this week,"" said Nick Bennenbroek, currency
strategist at Wells Fargo in New York.
 Over the medium term, the dollar still looks like it's
fighting an uphill battle, traders said. The U.S. Federal
Reserve is expected to announce more monetary easing next
month, likely through direct purchases of U.S. Treasury debt,
while euro zone governments are seen tightening fiscal and
monetary policy, making the euro more attractive to global
inventors.
 Interest rate spreads continued to widen as a result, with
U.S. yields falling as yields on German government debt rise.
 EURO NEAR PEAK?
 But eventually growth differentials may shift in the
dollar's favor if Fed policy perks up the economy in early
2011, just as euro zone governments begin to slash spending and
raise taxes to get public spending in order.
 ""Once austerity measures take effect in Europe, the economy
may contract relative to the U.S., a headwind for the euro,""
said Mark McCormick, strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.
 Though the euro is up some 10 percent against the dollar
since September, it has failed to hold ground for long on
several occasions above $1.40.
 On Friday, it was up 0.2 percent at $1.3944, off a session
peak of $1.3973. The dollar was down 0.1 percent at 81.22 yen,
not far from a 15-year low.
 McCormick said the euro's five-day and 20-day moving
averages against the dollar are close to converging, with the
former likely to cross below the latter next week, a bearish
short-term sign.
 He said the euro is up about 6 percent on a trade-weighted
basis, bad news for big exporters such as Germany.
 ""It all adds up to us oscillating over the near term
between $1.35 and $1.40, at least until we see what sort of
quantitative easing the Fed has in store,"" McCormick said.
 John Taylor, chairman and chief investment officer of FX
Concepts, expects the euro to peak between $1.43 and $1.45 and
says it could sink to parity with the dollar in 2011.
 LITTLE EXPECTED FROM G20
 Still, some analysts said there's room for more euro gains
in the short term, particularly if G20 leaders fail to make any
headway on currency disagreements at a meeting South Korea.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, in a letter sent
to G20 finance leaders and seen by Reuters, urged countries to
refrain from using exchange rates for economic advantage and to
adopt targets for their current account balances.
 But the proposal ran into stiff opposition from Japan,
Germany and some emerging countries, and analysts said failure
to reach agreement would free traders to keep selling dollars
in favor of the euro, emerging market and commodity-linked
currencies such as the Australian dollar.
 ""A new currency accord will be hard to achieve in principle

of domestic political pragmatism,"" said Lena Komileva, head of

 By Christiaan Hetzner
 FRANKFURT, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Volkswagen beat all forecasts
with a huge jump in third-quarter operating profit to 1.99
billion euros ($2.77 billion), thanks to a rebound in demand
that reduced the need for rebates.
 The operating profit in the seasonally weak quarter was
identical to that posted in the seasonally strong second-quarter
-- something almost unheard of in the auto industry.
 ""VW just delivered the highest absolute level of Q3 profits
in its history and one of the highest ever margins achieved in
any quarter,"" Bernstein analyst Max Warburton wrote in a
research note.
 Shares in Europe's largest carmaker traded up 3.18 percent
at 96.76 euros by 1628 GMT, easily outperforming the European
auto index, which was up 1.1 percent.
 Nevertheless, Volkswagen warned the trend would not hold.
 ""The successful business growth of the Volkswagen Group in
the first nine months of 2010 will not continue as strongly in
the fourth quarter,"" the company said in an unscheduled
statement published on Friday.
 Analysts dismissed the company's downbeat guidance for the
fourth quarter as overly conservative.
 ""The only thing I would criticise is the far too cautious
guidance. When they write that the fourth quarter will be weak,
I would almost be inclined to forget this entirely based on past
experience,"" said Metzler Bank's Juergen Pieper.
 The company's war chest surged to a dizzying 19.6 billion
euros in net cash by the end of September as revenue grew much
faster than investments thanks to a rebound in demand that
severely reduced the need to offer margin-eroding rebates.
 ""VW is generating enough cash to buy Alfa Romeo once a
quarter, to buy PSA every year and may soon have the funds to
take out MAN and Scania in their entirety (...) VW can afford to
do almost anything,"" Warburton wrote.
 
 FOREX BOOST 
 On a pretax basis, earnings were even better thanks to
income generated by its financial stakes in companies like MAN,
Porsche AG sports cars and its joint ventures in China, as well
as the valuation of an option to buy the remainder of Porsche
AG.
 ""We believe that the group's sales revenue and operating
profit in 2010 will continue to perform positively, despite
shifts in volumes between the markets,"" it continued, adding
that exchange rate effects would give profits a boost.
 A Reuters poll forecast an average operating profit of 5.23
billion euros for the full year -- an amount that at VW's
current rate could be easily achieved by the end of this month. 
 VW will post full-quarterly results and hold a conference
call with analysts on Oct. 27.

 CONSENSUS FORECAST: Inflation at 1.8 percent
 
 FACTORS TO WATCH:
 Euro zone inflation likely held steady just below the
European Central Bank's target in October as energy prices have
peaked, data is expected to show on October 29.
 The 1.8 percent median forecast in a Reuters poll of 36
analysts is in line with September's number. Forecasts range
from 1.7 percent to 1.9 percent.
 ""Energy inflation is expected to peak in October but will
continue to make a significant contribution to the annual rate
because of a growing contribution from gas prices,"" HSBC said in
a research note.
 Oil prices  remain well below record highs set in 2008
and are virtually in line with this time last year at around $81
per barrel.
 On Wednesday Germany, Europe's biggest economy, is expected
to say harmonised prices rose 1.3 percent year-on-year in
October. Italy is seen saying on Oct. 29 its harmonised prices
rose 1.7 percent this month.
 The ECB is seen leaving interest rates at record lows of 1.0
percent when it meets next month and for at least another year
as it fights to maintain growth and prevent the 16-nation bloc
from slipping back into recession. [ECILT/EU]
 Data due on Friday is expected to show unemployment in the
bloc held relatively steady at 10.1 percent in September.
 
 MARKET IMPACT
 An above consensus reading on inflation could spark
speculation that the ECB will start tightening policy sooner
than expected.
 A lower reading would suggest the economy's weakness is
preventing firms from raising prices and could fuel expectations
that monetary policy will remain loose, giving a boost to
fixed-income assets but hitting the euro.

 * Wheat sales in port slow, maize in demand
 * Barley exported
 
 (Adds industry comment, paragraph 3 and 4)
 By Martin Roberts
 MADRID, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The Spanish port of Tarragona was
unloading 49,500 tonnes of maize from a ship coming from the
United States, a port source said on Friday, the first U.S.
shipment in years due to concerns about genetically modified
grains.
 Officials at Spain's leading grain port were not immediately
available for comment, but the port roster showed that the
Ioannis K had set sail from Myrtle Grove, Louisiana, with a
cargo listed as ""agri-livestock and food"", which includes grain.
 Spain has not imported U.S. maize for years because it has
consisted of genetically modified strains not approved in
Europe, although Brussels did approve six GM maize varieties for
import in July.
 The move modified the EU's previous zero-tolerance stance,
which forced shipments of U.S. soy to be rejected last year
after they were found to contain minute traces of unauthorised
GM maize.
 Jorge Saja, of feed compounders' group CESFAC, said dealers
were offering U.S. maize for December delivery, following the
expected ratification in November by European Agriculture
Ministers of a low level presence (LLP) of GM maize strains.
 ""If the LLP solution is approved in a few weeks, and given
that all maize and soya strains grown in the Americas are at
least scientifically approved, the door could be opened for U.S.
maize to return,"" he said.
 Spain may import up to 2 million tonnes of maize a year at a
special cut levy under the terms of a trade accord originally
designed to compensate U.S. farmers for the loss of an important
market when the country joined the EU's forerunner in 1986.
 For many years, however, the so-called ""abatimiento"" scheme
has been used to import maize, the ingredient of choice for
animal feed makers, from other origins.
 No bids were tendered at the last auction for cut-levy maize
held last week, but that was expected because Brussels has set
the maize levy at zero.
 
 WHEAT DEMAND SLOWS
 The source added that northeasterly Tarragona had also
unloaded 46,000 tonnes of maize from Brazil in recent days, and
another 54,000 from Ukraine.
 ""With grain prices at the levels they are, consuming maize
in (animal feed) formulae is more advantageous because it has
more protein,"" he said.
 ""As for wheat, the domestic market is up and running, and
wheat here is very expensive, deliveries are not significant.""
 Prompt feed wheat was last offered at about 208 euros a
tonne in Tarragona, although dealers said it could not compete
with domestic new crop from a harvest that was much improved on
last year.
 Maize was quoted at 215/220 euros/tonne.
 Tarragona wheat stocks are close to full capacity at an
estimated 300,000 tonnes after a flurry of imports from Romania
and Bulgaria in recent weeks, but no new shipments were
chartered.
 Another product making a reappearance after a lull was
sorghum, 44,000 tonnes of which has recently arrived from the
United States, although it was not selling well.
 And in an unusual move in a country that depends on grain
imports, a small cargo of domestic barley was shortly to be sent
to Tunisia, adding to recent exports from Valencia, a
Mediterranean port closer to grain-growing areas.

 BEIJING, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Japan and South Korea moved on
Friday to reduce their dependence on China's rare earth metals
amid fears export reductions by Beijing could be the trigger for
a broader trade conflict as nations joust over currencies.
 Reports this week that China halted shipments of rare earths
to Japan during a sea territory dispute raised fears that China
could use its global dominance of supplies as a political lever.
 China denied reports it planned to slash export quotas, but
with more than 90 percent of the global production of rare
earths coming from China, the reports triggered alarm.
 In Tokyo, Trade Minister Akihiro Ohata said Japan wanted to
conclude a development programme with Vietnam for rare earths,
used in autos, computers, cell phones and other products.
 ""Vietnam is a very promising place, and naturally I am
strongly hoping for a joint development of rare earths,"" Jiji

Tan Dung, on Oct. 31 in Hanoi to agree on a development scheme.
 Former Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama left for Vietnam on
Friday to discuss possible cooperation in rare earths and
infrastructure development, Hatoyama's office said.
 Bloomberg, meanwhile, said South Korea wanted to cooperate
with Japan and the United States to develop alternative sources.
 In Geneva, the World Trade Organisation said it would not
publish a ruling in a separate dispute brought against China
over exports of raw materials such as bauxite and magnesium
until next April instead of this year.
 The chairman of the panel examining the cases said in a
statement on the WTO website the panel expected to complete its
work by April. The panel gave no reason for the delay, but said
it had been agreed with the parties to the dispute.
 The United States, European Union and Mexico launched a
dispute at the WTO last year, saying Chinese export restrictions
on the minerals discriminated against foreign manufacturers and
gave an unfair advantage to domestic producers. Japanese
trading houses Toyota Tsusho Corp and Sojitz Corp are already
preparing for rare earth development in Vietnam, while Sumitomo
Corp, another trading firm, aims to start rare earth shipment to
Japan from Vietnam as early as 2013, the Nikkei said.
 Sumitomo and Sojitz said plans were still in early stages.
 Bloomberg quoted Kim Sang Woo, a deputy director at the
Minerals Resources Division of South Korea's Knowledge Economy
Ministry, as saying he expected China would maintain export caps
and increase stockpiles to meet higher demand.
 DWINDLING STOCKS
 Sun Zhenyu, ambassador to the World Trade Organisation, told
Reuters Insider that China's own stocks of the rare metals were
falling fast and had to be conserved.
 ""I think there will be probably not a very quick change in
the export quota mechanism of rare earths,"" Sun said in an
interview on the trade implications of the five-year-plan,
unveiled this month.
 China's media has accused Western countries of making
unreasonable demands over the cheap supply of rare earths.
 ""Rare earths are a commodity. Each country has the right to
decide how much it exports or imports. This is normal economic
behaviour,"" the People's Daily said.
 ""China has the absolute right to decide for itself how much
rare earths it can export and produce.""
 But any cut in exports could rattle firms that use the
metals. A slowdown in shipments may reflect a drop in export
quotas, which has left over-committed traders scrambling to
cover orders placed in the first half of the year, analysts say.
 The rare earth concerns come as G20 finance officials
meeting in South Korea struggle to reach an agreement to tackle
global economic imbalances and fend off the prospect of damaging
currency devaluations.
 Many countries gave a cool reception to U.S. proposals to
set limits on current account balances to defuse tension over
currencies that economists fear could trigger trade wars.
 Experts say Vietnam is a key channel for smuggling rare
earths and other minerals out of China.
 About 20,000 tonnes of rare earths were smuggled out of
China in 2009, according to a note by Eurasia Group analyst
Damien Ma, supplementing legal exports through that year's
quotas of about 50,000 tonnes.

1426,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2010 08:08AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-G20 currency talk and earnings vie," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The degree to which financial
markets are on edge about global imbalances and their impact on
asset flows was writ large in the past week on currency markets.
 Scanning its foreign exchange platforms, Deutsche bank noted
that some 30 percent of short dollar positions were removed on
Monday, in the sudden belief that the greenback would rise, only
for a good third of them to come back on Tuesday.
 The trigger was China's surprise rate hike and fears that a
new tightening cycle was about to begin. But all that is part of
major uncertainty surrounding the G20 meeting under way in South
Korea with its ongoing row about currency rates.
 Next week is almost certainly going to be dominated by
whatever the Group of 20 finance ministers agree over the
weekend, where the United States has been struggling to push
others into a deal to commit emerging markets to cut their
current account surpluses and allow their currencies to rise.
 On markets, it is likely only to be matched in impact by the
continuing corporate earnings season, which has been relatively
strong so far.
 What is decided in Korea -- and it may be a classic
diplomatic fudge, leaving the issue to G20 heads of government
later in the year -- could have broad implications on assets.
 ""Investors are hoping for some guidance about where the
dollar is heading next,"" said Alessandro Bee, economist at Bank
Sarasin in Zurich.
 The prospect of a weaker dollar and higher emerging market
currencies, as well as economic growth differentials, have
already triggered massive investment flows into emerging
markets.
 Investors poured a net $3.76 billion into emerging market
equity funds tracked by EPFR Global in the latest week, lifting
year-to-date inflows above 2009's full year record-breaking
$44.2 billion.
 They also committed a further $1.4 billion into emerging
market bond funds.
 Conversely, the prospect of more asset-buying by the U.S.
Federal Reserve in a new quantitative easing programme has
helped lift the U.S. S&P 500 index as much as 13 percent since
late August.
 Some of that would be put at risk if QE plans were trimmed
back a bit as a result of some kind of G20 pact.
 In Japan, meanwhile, a lot of the Nikkei's underperformance
has to do with exporters struggling with a strong yen.
 
 EARNINGS PLEASE
 While a lot of attention has been paid to currency tensions,
however, investors have been encouraged to buy riskier assets by
a relatively robust U.S. earnings season.
 There have been a few disappointments, but on the whole
companies have been coming in above expectations and analysts
have been lifting their projections for the quarter.
 Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research estimates that with 139
companies in the S&P 500 having reported, a whopping 83 percent
have surprised on the upside.
 This has taken blended earnings growth expectations for the
third quarter -- actual plus estimated earnings yet be reported
-- to 27.4 percent.
 In turn, that reflects a steady increase in expectation for
the quarter from 21.6 percent at the beginning of the year.
 But investors are still cautious about the future.
 ""Earnings estimates are well supported, however, one should
view this in the medium term context,"" said Tammo Greetfeld,
equity strategist at UniCredit.
 ""The declining trend of leading indicators points to a
deterioration of 2011 earnings trend going forward.""
 According to Thomson Reuters research, analysts are
expecting a bigger jump in earnings for the fourth quarter, some
31.7 percent, but a sharp slowdown in growth in early 2011 to
11.5 percent.
 U.S. earnings in the coming week include Bristol-Myers
Squibb, Ford, Dupont, Procter & Gamble and Microsoft.
 Meanwhile, the season heats up in Europe, with earnings from
the likes of Deutsche Bank, Volkeswagen and Royal Dutch Shell.
 Otherwise in the coming week, investors of different hues
will be focused on U.S. and UK GDP reports, the second round of
the Brazilian presidential election, budgets in Turkey and South
Africa, and the fast-approaching U.S. mid-term elections.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The dollar steadied on Friday as
investors hesitated about extending bearish bets against the
greenback on uncertainty over whether any agreement would be
reached at a weekend meeting of Group of 20 finance leaders.
 The United States raised its rhetoric, calling for countries
to avoid using their currencies to gain an economic advantage,
but its proposal to put a numerical cap on current account
balances ran into stiff opposition from Japan, Germany and some
emerging countries.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, in a letter to
G-20 finance leaders that was seen by Reuters, said emerging
economies with undervalued currencies and solid reserves must
allow their currencies to adjust in line with fundamentals.
[ID:nTOE69L05V]
 The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the
greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was
flat at 77.41 <.DXY> but off the day's low of 77.209.
 ""A new currency accord will be hard to achieve in principle
and even harder to push through in practice, over the hurdles of
domestic political pragmatism,"" said Lena Komileva, head of G7
market economics at Tullett Prebon.
 Many in the market were sceptical of whether a binding
agreement would be reached. But they remained cautious about any
surprises such as a formal pact to allow Asian currencies to
appreciate.
 Analysts said such a pact could include assurances from the
United States that any quantitative easing (QE) from the Federal
Reserve would be modest. Any such assurance could provide a
short-term boost to the U.S. dollar and would ease the pressure
on Asian central banks to intervene and check their currencies'
strength.
 Asian and other emerging economies are wary that a large
amount of stimulus from the Federal Reserve would increase the
flood of dollar inflows to their countries, putting more upward
pressure on their currencies and leading to asset bubbles.
 ""Obviously, such an agreement puts liquidity trades at risk
and currencies like the euro which have benefited a lot from
this could see some correction,"" said Ian Stannard, senior
currency strategist, at BNP Paribas.

 FED IS THE STORY
 The dollar also made solid gains against the Swiss Franc
, rising to a three-week high of 0.9778 francs on steady
buying by semi-official names. 
 Still, analysts say any bounce in the dollar maybe
shortlived until the size of expected quantitative easing (QE)
by the U.S. Federal Reserve is made clear, possibly at a policy
meeting next month. Expectations of more QE from the Fed has
seen the dollar index lose more than 7 percent since early
September.
 ""The dollar remains on the back foot until the Fed; that is
the main story,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 The euro briefly recovered losses, rising after the German
Ifo institute's business sentiment index unexpectedly rose in
October to 107.6 from 106.8. [ID:nBAE003838].
 Higher interbank euro rates were also supportive, but
overall the single currency struggled to stay in positive
territory and was last marginally higher on the day at $1.3930.

 The dollar slipped 0.26 percent to 81.15 yen , holding
above a 15-year low of 80.84 yen hit earlier this week and a
record postwar low of 79.75 yen set in 1995.
 Wariness about Japanese intervention has supported the
dollar, after Tokyo stepped into the market in September for the
first time in six years to rein in the yen. [ID:nTOE69L08W].

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The dollar pared losses on Friday
as investors were uncertain whether the United States would gain
support at a G20 meeting in calling for countries to avoid
weakening their currencies to gain an economic advantage.
 European shares slipped on caution as the G20 finance
ministers' meeting got underway, but losses were limited as the
spectre of more quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve next
month supported equity markets around the world.
 U.S. shares were expected to open lower, after Asian shares
were little changed.
 Short-dated German government bond yields rose after an
unexpected rise in German business sentiment reinforced the
European Central Bank's cautiously optimistic view of the
region's economy, although this failed to boost stocks.
 Investors were sceptical Washington will gain support in
trying to get countries to stop weakening their currencies for
economic gain, and many in the market anticipated a statement
from the meeting lacking any punch would keep the dollar weak.
 ""Markets are really struggling to see what's going to come
out of the G20 meeting,"" said Simon Smith economist at FXPro.
 ""(U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy) Geithner has his idea
about putting something in practice about currency rates
reflecting fundamentals ... but we've heard this all before.""
Group of 20 finance and central bank chiefs meet on Friday
and Saturday in Gyeongju, South Korea, seeking agreement on a
common path to manage currency, trade and macroeconomic
imbalances ahead of a leadership meeting in Seoul next month.
 A draft communique called for countries to avoid economic
imbalances and excessive state interference in currency markets,
Russia's deputy finance minister told Reuters.. No numeric
targets for current accounts were mentioned.
 Developing economies such as China may be cool to the idea
of letting their currencies fly when the Fed is discussing a new
round of quantitative easing, an issue which has spread tension
across markets over a potential currency war.
 For financial markets, at stake in the G20 meeting is
whether to keep alive what has been a dominant trade since
September of selling dollars to buy emerging market equities,
commodities and longer maturity bonds.
 The dollar has taken a beating in the past month on swirling
speculation the Fed will launch another round of pumping cash
into markets to help stimulate the U.S. economic recovery, which
would likely push the dollar even lower.
 By 1055 GMT, the dollar was up slightly on the day against a
currency basket at 77.482, while the euro slipped a touch to
$1.3912.
 The dollar is poised to end the week slightly higher after
suffering a deep sell-off in the past month or so, as investors
trim back short positions which have been piling up since
speculation of more Fed easing has picked up.
 Investors also took profits on their bets on emerging Asian
currencies, particularly after China's interest rate rise on
Tuesday sparked concerns about the impact on domestic growth.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index slipped 0.1 percent as
G20-related caution prompted investors to trim long equity
positions after the index hit a six-month high on Thursday. 
 ""Traders are likely to clear their books (ahead of the
weekend), especially with the G20 meeting going on,"" said Heino
Ruland, strategist at Ruland Research in Frankfurt.
 Still, losses were limited in market participants expected
stocks to remain supported given a strong run of European and
U.S. earnings, which suggest the global economy is recovering.
 Limiting losses were higher-than-expected profits at
Ericsson, the world's biggest mobile network gear maker.
 The MSCI world equity index slipped 0.3 percent, but hovered
in range of a roughly two-year high hit earlier in the month.
World stocks have been boosted by a rise in emerging market
currencies, as capital flows into these high-growth regions have
cranked up on growing expectations the Fed will have to print
dollars to buy more assets and pull down market rates.
 Global emerging market equity funds absorbed a net $3.76
billion in new money while emerging market bond funds took in
more than $1 billion in the week ended Oct 20, fund tracker EPFR
Global said in a note.
 With more than two months to go until the end of the year,
inflows to emerging markets have already exceeded 2009.
 The German Ifo business sentiment index hit its highest in 3
1/2 years on Friday, helping to push the yield on two-year
German government bonds rose almost a basis point higher to
1.010 percent.
 Oil investors cheered the data, which showed the German
economy remains buoyant pushing U.S. crude oil prices up 0.7
percent on the day to $81.10, although support for the dollar
prodded gold prices to a two-week low.

 GYEONGJU, South Korea, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Germany's economy
Minister resisted a call from the United States on Friday for
direct action in tackling foreign exchange and trade imbalances,
warning of the risks of succumbing to ""planned economy""
thinking.
 Rainer Bruederle, who is attended a meeting of G20 finance
ministers in South Korea in place of Germany's hospitalised
finance minister, said the Group of 20 leading economic powers
must correct the errors that have led to imbalances but must
rely on market processes to do so.
 ""We need a strengthening of the market economy processes,""
Bruederle told reporters on the sidelines of the G20 meeting,
warning against ""a fallback into planned economy thinking"".
 ""We must correct undesirable economic developments that lead
to imbalances,"" he added.
 Earlier, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, in a
letter to finance leaders seen by Reuters, called for more
proactive moves by both developed and developing countries.
 ""Countries with persistent surpluses should undertake
structural, fiscal and exchange rate policies to boost domestic
sources of growth,"" he said. [ID:nTOE69L056]
 Geithner's overtures have already been rejected by countries
as diverse as India and Japan and Bruederle's comments further
dent prospects of the G20 agreeing a universal deal that would
address global economic imbalances and tackle attempts by many
emerging economies and others to weaken their currencies.
 Bruederle said finance ministers from the Group of Seven
countries recognised at an earlier meeting on Friday that
Germany had made an important contribution to the recovery of
the global economy.
 The G20 needed to tackle the root causes of the world's
economic troubles, he added.
 ""We need more balance, more stability in the global economic
growth process,"" Bruederle said, adding that the International
Monetary Fund should take a stronger monitoring role.

 * Stability vital for yuan global role - economist
(Adds details, quotes)
 BEIJING, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The global economy has yet to
find its feet, with the U.S. recovery slowing and imbalances
within the euro zone worsening, a Chinese central banker said
in comments published on Friday.
 In unusually candid remarks, Li Dongrong, an assistant
governor of the People's Bank of China, also warned that a
continuation of ultra-loose policies in rich countries might
unleash a flood of capital inflows into emerging economies.
 Against the background of a fragile global recovery, he
said that China could not waver from its long-term plan to
boost the yuan's international clout.
 He offered a glum assessment of the state of the global
economy in the speech published on the central bank's website
(www.pbc.gov.cn).
 ""The foundations of the recovery are still not solid,"" Li
said at a meeting with members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) earlier this week in southern China.
 ""Recently, the U.S. economic recovery has slowed and the
effects of the government's stimulus policy have been unclear,""
he said.
 Although European sovereign debt worries had eased
somewhat, there was still no fundamental solution, he said,
adding that imbalances in the euro zone were becoming more
severe as Germany powered ahead while countries in southern
Europe struggled.
 Japan's economic growth was also faltering, he noted.
 ""When the yen was recently facing heavy appreciation
pressure, the Japanese central bank had no choice but to use 2
trillion yen ($24.6 billion) to intervene in its exchange
rate,"" he said in the first version of the speech published on
the website.
 A later version did not contain the reference to Japan's
intervention on Sept 15.
 Extremely loose monetary policies in the United States and
Japan were presenting a sharp challenge to developing countries
that are growing faster, he said.
 ""Emerging markets will together face quite large capital
inflows as well as currency appreciation and inflationary
pressures,"" he said.
 YUAN GOING GLOBAL
 Beijing supported the greater use of bilateral currency
swaps to facilitate the expansion of the yuan's role, Li said.
 ""We will continue to sign currency swap agreements with
relevant countries in line with demands to support the use of
the yuan in cross-border trade and direct investment,"" he said.
 Since the global financial crisis in late 2008, China has
launched a steady stream of policy initiatives along the path
of making the yuan an internationally accepted currency for
trade settlement to reduce reliance on the dollar.
 China has signed currency swap deals with a handful of
countries, including South Korea, Malaysia and Argentina, and
this year said that it would allow all foreign trade partners
to conduct their deals in yuan.
 Separately, a former policy adviser to the PBOC said that
keeping the yuan relatively stable will be crucial for China's
drive to gradually internationalise the currency.
 Bolstering the yuan's usage in international trade remained
the near-term focus in the ongoing programme to increase the
yuan's global influence, said Li Yang, vice head of the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, a top government think-tank.
 ""China should not only encourage financial institutions to
expand trade financing but also create a stable international
environment for the internationalisation process by keeping the
yuan's exchange rate relatively stable,"" Li said in an article
published in the Chinese-language Studies of International
Finance magazine. [ID:nTOE69L03A]
 Li's comments on the yuan  echoed the official
strategy of gradually expanding the yuan's use abroad while
carefully managing its value versus the dollar at the same
time.
 Financial reforms to develop the yuan-denominated debt
market would help boost its attractiveness and achieve the
long-term goal of making it a global reserve currency, Li said.
 ""Up to now, the yuan has limited reserve functions and has
yet to become an 'anchor' for other currencies,"" he added.

 AMSTERDAM, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The port of Rotterdam,
Europe's biggest, said on Friday it was seeing a continued but
slowing recovery in cargo as it reported a 13.4 percent rise in
volumes for the first nine months of the year.
 Cargo volumes at Rotterdam, a major transit point for

 ""Growth is levelling off, but it's still slightly better

 Rotterdam said almost every sort of cargo showed improved
volumes on recovering international trade, led by iron ore and
scrap metal with a rise of 112 percent.
 It said steel plants are operating almost at full capacity
due to high demand from the automotive and machinery industry,
stretching capacity at Rotterdam's terminals.
 Coal volumes rose 2 percent as imports for the steel
industry remained at a high level, but demand from coal-fired
power plants slowed in favour of a pick-up in gas.
 Crude oil volume rose 3 percent despite low refinery
margins, the port said, while growth in mineral oil volumes
(petrol, diesel, kerosene and heating oil) slowed in the latest
quarter but were still up 5 percent for the nine months versus a
year ago.
 Only volumes of agricultural bulk goods declined, by 7
percent, due to increased use of crops grown in Europe such as
rapeseed instead of supplies from overseas, the port authority

 * Also calls for 4 pct cap on BOP imbalances
 * Doubts remain on coordinated G20 action on FX
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Friday after
U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner urged the Group of 20
nations not to weaken their currencies or keep them undervalued,
in his push for a coordinated move to fix global imbalances.
 ""Geithner appeared to be more aggressive (about global
economic rebalancing), leading to the dollar's weakness,"" said a
trader at a Japanese bank.
 Some in the market saw his comments as suggesting a limited
effort to move to immediately prop up the dollar.
 Geithner also said emerging economies with undervalued
currencies and solid reserves must allow their currencies to
adjust in line with fundamentals, while a G20 source told Reuters
he also called for a 4 percent cap on current account imbalances.
 The euro gained about 0.3 percent while the Australian dollar
rose 0.5 percent after Geithner made his proposal in a letter to
G20 finance chiefs ahead of a meeting in South Korea later the
day.
 The U.S. proposals, including a plan to set a numerical
balance of payment target, have so far run into stiff resistance
from many other G20 partners.
 A senior G20 official, however, put the chances for an
agreement on current account targeting at even. ""It looks
like the markets' interpretation of it and why it's driven the
dollar lower is that Geithner's preoccupation with trade issues
as opposed to currency suggests there won't be any coordinated
effort to underpin the U.S. dollar,"" said Sue Trinh, senior FX
strategist at Royal Bank of Canada,
 ""It looks like there's still quite a divide in terms of
beliefs and expectations. Any thought of a consensus looks pretty
difficult at this stage ... but it's a long time between now and
Saturday (when the G20 will issue a communique),"" Trinh said.
 Some saw the possibility of a statement playing down the
notion of a currency conflict, which might offer the dollar some
support in the near term, but others said any reaction would be
brief and attention would flick back to the other major question
of how big any quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve might
be.
 CURRENCY CONSENSUS
 The dollar index fell 0.2 percent to 77.264, slipping further
away from resistance at 77.60-65, a break of which is vital to
keep up momentum for a higher bounce from a 10-month low of
76.144 hit last week.
 It has major trend-line support at 76.10, which could limit
its downside, although a break there could open the way to last
November's low at 74.17.
 Prospects for the Fed to pump more money into the economy
next month, likely through direct purchases of Treasury debt,
have pushed the dollar down more than 7 percent against other
major currencies since September.
 The euro, which corrected sharply lower this week after a
month-long rally, needs to tackle resistance at $1.4050, which it
failed to clear on Thursday.
 A break above that would open up the way for a retest of
$1.4161, the top of the recent rally and its highest level since
January.
 Dollar/yen slipped 0.3 percent to 81.10 yen, still holding
above its latest 15-year low of 80.84 yen set this week and
keeping away from its record postwar low of 79.75 set in 1995.
 Wariness about intervention has kept the dollar supported,
after Japan intervened in September for the first time in six

a little bit of unease about putting on a fresh short position

 But some traders also said speculation is mounting that Japan
may not intervene in the near future as global debate is raging
over competitive currency devaluation.

1442,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2010 02:12AM ET</span>",TEXT-Geithner's letter to G20," GYEONGJU, South Korea, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Following is thea
text of the main points of a letter sent to G20 finance leaders
meeting in South Korea, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.
 ""First, G-20 countries should commit to undertake policies
consistent with reducing external imbalances below a specified
share of GDP over the next few years, recognizing that some
exceptions may be required for countries that are structurally
large exporters of raw materials. This means that G-20 countries
running persistent deficits should boost national savings by
adopting credible medium-term fiscal targets consistent with
sustainable debt levels and by strengthening export performance.
Conversely, G-20 countries with persistent surpluses should
undertake structural, fiscal and exchange rate policies to boost
domestic sources of growth and support global demand. Since our
current account balances depend on our own policy choices as well
as on the policies pursued by other G-20 countries, these
commitments require a cooperative effort.
 ""Second, to facilitate the orderly rebalancing of global
demand, G-20 countries should commit to refrain from exchange
rate policies designed to achieve competitive advantage by either
weakening their currency or preventing the appreciation of an
undervalued currency. G-20 emerging market countries with
significantly undervalued currencies and adequate precautionary
reserves need to allow their exchange rates to adjust fully over
time to levels consistent with economic fundamentals. G-20
advanced countries will work to ensure against excessive
volatility and disorderly movement in exchange rates. Together
these actions should reduce the risk of excessive volatility in
capital flows for emerging economies that have flexible exchange
rates.
 ""Third, the G-20 should call on the IMF to assume a special
role in monitoring progress on our commitments. The IMF should
publish a semiannual report assessing G-20 countries progress
toward the agreed objectives on external sustainability and the
consistency of countries' exchange rate, capital account,
structural, and fiscal policies toward meeting those objectives.""
 ""With progress on these fronts, we should reach final
agreement in an ambitious package of reforms to strengthen the
IMF's financial resources and its financial tools, and to reform
the governance structure to increase the voice and representation
of dynamic emerging economies.""

1443,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2010 02:04AM ET</span>",Stability vital for yuan global ascent- economist," BEIJING, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Keeping the yuan relatively
stable will be crucial for China's drive to gradually
internationalise the currency, a former adviser to the People's
Bank of China said in comments published on Friday.
 Bolstering the yuan's usage in international trade remained
the near-term focus in the ongoing programme to increase the
yuan's global influence, said Li Yang, a former member of the
central bank's monetary policy committee.
 ""China should not only encourage financial institutions to
expand trade financing but also create a stable international
environment for the internationalisation process by keeping the
yuan's exchange rate relatively stable,"" Li said in an article
published in the Chinese-language Studies of International
Finance magazine.
 Li's comments on the yuan  echoed the official
strategy of gradually expanding the yuan's use abroad while
carefully managing its value versus the dollar at the same time.
 China should push for more bilateral currency swap deals with
trade partners, taking advantage of its massive foreign exchange
reserves, said Li, vice head of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, a top government think-tank.
 Financial reforms to develop the yuan-denominated debt market
would help boost its attractiveness and achieve the long-term
goal of making it a global reserve currency, Li said.
 ""Up to now, the yuan has limited reserve functions and has
yet to become an 'anchor' for other currencies,"" he added.
 Since the global financial crisis in late 2008, China has
launched a steady stream of policy initiatives along the path of
making the yuan an internationally accepted currency for trade
settlement to reduce reliance on the dollar.
 China has signed currency swap deals with a handful of
countries, including South Korea, Malaysia and Argentina, and
this year said that it would allow all foreign trade partners to
conduct their deals in yuan.

 * Japan govt to unveil stance on FTAs before APEC summit
 * Japan firms want progress on free trade deals
 * Many ruling Democratic Party lawmakers oppose trade pact
 By Linda Sieg
 TOKYO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Japan's economics minister said on
Friday that Tokyo should join a U.S.-led Asia-Pacific free trade
initiative to keep its firms from fleeing abroad, despite a
backlash in the ruling party against the proposed deal.
 Japanese firms are pressing the government to forge more
trade pacts and catch up with regional rivals such as South
Korea. Economists agree such deals are vital to keep more
manufacturers from moving overseas, taking jobs with them.
 The government is expected to unveil its stance on free trade
deals, including the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP),
ahead of an Asia-Pacific leaders summit next month in Yokohama,
near Toyko, which U.S. President Barack Obama will attend.
 Many lawmakers in Prime Minister Naoto Kan's Democratic Party
of Japan (DPJ), however, are worried about the fallout from such
trade deals on long-protected and politically powerful farmers.
 ""Japan needs to show its intention to join the TPP early ...
But some ruling party members are opposed, as there has not been
enough debate within the party,"" Economics Minister Banri Kaieda
told a news conference.
 ""As the yen remains strong, Japanese manufacturers have to
produce high value-added products (to stay competitive) ... But
their products won't sell in Asian markets if high tariffs are
levied,"" Kaieda said. ""Joining TPP would thus be unavoidable in
order to keep manufacturing products in Japan.""
 The yen's surge to 15-year-highs has eroded an export-led
recovery and is pushing firms to rethink production plans.
 The United States and seven other countries launched talks on
a proposed TPP agreement earlier this year and Washington is
trying to bring Malaysia on board too. U.S. free trade advocates
see the initiative as a way to ensure the United States isn't
locked out of regional arrangements.
 BUSINESS LOBBY, MP BACKLASH
 Japan's biggest business lobby wants Kan to offer to take
part in TPP at the Nov. 13-14 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) summit, where the forum's leaders will discuss a proposed
Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific covering all 21 members.
 ""If we miss this chance, Japan will lag far behind other
countries in developing an international business environment,""
business lobby Keidanren said this week, urging Kan to declare
his intention to join the TPP talks at the APEC summit.
 A free trade deal inked between South Korea and the European
Union this month in particular has given corporate Japan the
jitters, while rival China is also considered ahead in the race.
 The trade pact talk is prompting a backlash, however, among
ruling Democratic Party lawmakers reluctant to upset farmers,
whose political clout is amplified by an electoral system that
gives rural votes more weight than those in urban areas.
 ""I hope the government will only consider the idea and stop
there,"" former farm minister Masahiko Yamada told reporters after
more than 100 lawmakers gathered on Thursday to oppose joining
the trade initiative, which also includes Australia, Brunei,
Chile, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.
 Many of the lawmakers at the meeting are supporters of Kan's
rival, DPJ heavyweight Ichiro Ozawa, who last month lost a
leadership race to Kan. Ozawa now faces indictment over a funding
scandal but he remains a force in the party.
 Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshito Sengoku, the No.2 in Kan's
cabinet, acknowledged the conflicting pressures.
 ""We must preserve what needs to be preserved from the
perspective of food security and national land conservation,"" he
told a news conference, stressing changes were needed to attract
young people to a sector whose population is ageing fast.
 ""At the same time, Japan as a country must open up, and as
policies for that, there are EPAs (economic partnership
agreements) and TPP,"" he said.
 ""How to express this is a big issue for the party.""

 * Euro capped after repeated failure above $1.40
 * Euro/yen chart showing some deterioration
 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The dollar sat tight on Friday as
G20 finance ministers began a meeting which players doubt will
yield much progress on the vexed question of currency
depreciations, with charts instead dictating play.
 The euro, which corrected sharply lower this week after a
month-long rally, paused after a rebound failed to clear
resistance at $1.4050 on Thursday, and was showing signs of
deterioration on its euro/yen chart.
 The dollar index, which has staged a small rebound from a
10-month low, needs a sustained break of resistance at 77.60-65
to keep up momentum for a higher bounce.
 For now, though, the market is watching the G20 meeting of
finance ministers and central bankers in South Korea. An informed
source said they were unlikely to reach an accord rejecting
currency devaluations and capping current account balances after
U.S. proposals ran into stiff opposition.
 ""It's too much to expect all these countries to produce
anything meaningful, concrete and binding. Even (U.S. Treasury
Secretary Tim) Geithner said this is a 2-3 year process,"" said
Gareth Berry, a currency strategist at UBS in Singapore.
 Some saw the possibility of a statement playing down the
notion of a currency conflict, which might offer the dollar some
support near term, but others said any reaction would be brief
and attention would flick back to the other major question of how
big any quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve might be.
 With a second round of QE now expected, the major currencies
have established holding patterns as the market awaits events.
 The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.3934, with initial support
at about $1.3870, Thursday's low and a 50 percent retracement of
its rebound from this week's $1.3697 low, then at $1.3820-30 and
$1.3775.
 Initial resistance is plotted at $1.3960 with bigger
resistance at Thursday's high around $1.4050, where a break would
open up for a re-test of $1.4161, the top of the recent rally and
its highest level since January.
 The euro slipped 0.1 percent to 113.11 yen, with selling
appearing to come from hedge funds or institutional investors, a
Japanese bank trader said.
 Euro/yen's outlook has deteriorated on its daily Ichimoku
charts, popular among Japanese traders, as its tenkan line, now
at 113.16, has dropped below its kijun line, now at 113.55, for
the first time since Japan's intervention on Sept. 15.
 Dollar/yen slipped 0.2 percent to 81.17 yen, still holding
above its latest 15-year low of 80.84 yen set this week and
keeping away from its record postwar low of 79.75 set in 1995.
 Wariness about intervention has kept the dollar supported,
after Japan intervened in September for the first time in six
years.
 ""People are just not quite sure what Japan's tactics are on
the currency and how afraid they should be. But clearly there
is a little bit of unease about putting on a fresh short
position from here,"" said Sean Callow, a currency strategist at
Westpac Bank in Sydney.
 Still, any rallies rapidly meet with selling, likely by
Japanese exporters, and the dollar failed to rise back above
82.00 yen even when it was correcting higher against other
currencies this week.
 Prospects for the Fed to pump more money into the economy
next month, likely through direct purchases of Treasury debt,
have pushed the dollar down more than 7 percent against other
major currencies since September.
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback
versus a basket of six major currencies, was flat at 77.404,
above a recent 10-month low of 76.144 but still well off highs
around 83 seen last month.
 Immediate resistance stood at 77.65, with major resistance
around 78.35, about the high of Wednesday trade.
 It has major trend line support at 76.10, which could limit
its downside, although a break there could open the way to last
November's low at 74.17.
 ""Another downleg in DXY would require taking out these
thresholds (76.10), which would likely require another round of
distinct USD bearishness,"" said David Watt, a senior currency
strategist at RBC Dominion Securities in Toronto.

 By Abhijit Neogy and Luciana Lopez
 GYEONGJU, South Korea, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The United States
struggled on Friday to win backing for a proposal to set limits
on external imbalances as a way of pressing countries with
surpluses such as China to let their exchange rates rise.
 In a letter to fellow finance ministers of the Group of 20
leading economies, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said
countries should implement policies to reduce their current
account imbalances below a specified share of national output.
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said Geithner,
backed by host South Korea, proposed limiting surpluses and
deficits on the current account -- the broadest measure of trade
in goods and services -- to 4 percent of gross domestic product.
 But the plan met with a cool reception on the first day of a
two-day meeting meant to smooth the path for a G20 summit in
Seoul on Nov. 11-12.
 Big exporting countries that habitually run chunky trade
surpluses led the opposition.
 A G20 source said China was against any limits on
imbalances, German Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle warned of a
throwback to ""planned economy thinking"", and Russian Deputy
Finance Minister Dmitry Pankin said a draft communique to be
issued on Saturday would steer clear of numerical targets.
 ""The communique is very politically correct. There's nothing
sharp in it,"" Pankin said. ""In the long term the focus should be
on the exchange rates reflecting market conditions. Excessive
state interference in currencies should be avoided.""
 Noda also voiced scepticism. ""We doubt whether rigid
numerical targets should be set. But when checking the progress
in rectifying imbalances, that might be an idea,"" he told
reporters.

 DOUBTS ABOUND
 The criticism underscored the difficulties facing the G20 as
it strives to put the world economy on a more stable footing and
defuse currency tensions that economists fear could trigger
trade wars.
 While the G20 won praise for coordination of stimulus
packages during the global financial crisis, its unity has been
tested by low growth in rich countries and attempts by some
emerging market economies to preserve export competitiveness by
holding down their exchange rates.
 Saudi Arabia, Germany and Russia are the G20 members with
the biggest current account surpluses, but China is the chief
culprit in Washington's eyes -- and the unspoken target of
Geithner's letter -- because of massive currency market
intervention to keep a lid on the yuan.
 Beijing has amassed $2.65 trillion in official currency
reserves as a consequence, and prompted the U.S. House of
Representatives to pass a bill threatening retaliation unless
China lets its currency off the leash to reduce its huge trade
surplus with the United States.
 G20 countries, Geithner said, ""should commit to refrain from
exchange rate policies designed to achieve competitive advantage
by either weakening their currency or preventing the
appreciation of an undervalued currency"".
 Chinese officials made no public comment, but a G20 source
said Beijing was opposed to any communique that explicitly bound
countries to limits on current account balances or any other
form of rules on currency policy. [ID:nTOE69L0A8]
 The source, with direct knowledge of the talks, said the
group of rich and emerging economies was split not only on the
question of currencies but also on how to give poorer countries
more voting power at the International Monetary Fund.
 ""Positions are still very much divided. It's a rift down the
middle on both issues,"" the source said, predicting ""bland""
language in the closing communique to paper over the cracks.
 
 LOOKING FOR CONSENSUS
 Not everyone rejected the U.S. gambit out of hand.
 ""At a time when people are talking about currency wars, the
merit of Geithner's proposal is that it shifts the discussion
back to the macroeconomic framework,"" a French official said.
 Jim Flaherty, Canada's finance minister, said setting
numerical targets was a step in the right direction.
 ""There's a desire to reach consensus, to be collaborative,
to move in the direction of an action plan that we can present
to our leaders so that they can adopt it when they meet here in
a couple of weeks,"" he said.
 But many emerging market policymakers blame lax U.S.
policies for the global financial crisis. They also fear
Washington is prepared to debase the dollar by flooding the
banking system with cash to try to breathe life into the
stuttering U.S. economy.
 Expectations that the Federal Reserve will crank up the
dollar printing presses has sent a tide of money pouring into
emerging markets, boosting their currencies and asset prices and
complicating the conduct of fiscal and monetary policy.
 Brazil and Thailand have responded by introducing controls
on capital inflows, while other central banks have stepped up
currency interventions. [ID:nN18280200]
 ""We must demonstrate that we can, in the immediate term,
cooperate to avert what many are now terming a currency war. We
must find a solution to this by the Seoul summit,"" Indian

 HONG KONG, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Friday on
speculation a U.S. plan that included letting undervalued
currencies strengthen would gain support at a contentious
weekend Group of 20 meeting, lifting gold and oil prices.
 Major European stocks opened lower, with Britain's FTSE 100
down 0.1 percent, France's CAC 40 down 0.5 percent and
Germany's DAX off 0.3 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 opened 0.1
percent lower.
 A positive outlook from LG Display, the world's No. 2 LCD
flat screen maker, spurred a rally in shares in the technology
sector and pushed up Asian stocks, which are headed for the
first weekly decline in two months.
 G20 nations should refrain from currency policies aimed at
gaining a competitive edge and aim to keep trade imbalances
contained, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said in a
letter to finance chiefs in the group who are meeting in
Gyeongju, South Korea. Canada said it supported the proposals.
 However, developing economies such as China may be cool to
the idea of letting their currencies fly when the Federal
Reserve is discussing a new round of quantitative easing.
 For financial markets, at stake in the G20 meeting is
whether to keep alive what has been a dominant trade since
September of selling dollars to buy emerging market equities,
commodities and longer maturity bonds. So far on Friday,
dealers have been willing to add to the trade.
 Citi's currency strategists recommended adding to bets
against the dollar ahead of the weekend.

 * Inflation data next week important for Nov rate hike
 By Wayne Cole
 SYDNEY, Oct 22 (Reuters) -Australia's export prices have
surged for a second straight quarter as Asian demand fuelled
huge increases for iron ore and coal, showering the economy in
cash and illustrating just why interest rates are heading
higher.
 The 7.8 percent increase in export prices for the third
quarter came on top of a huge 16.1 percent rise the previous
quarter. In all, prices were up 27.7 percent in the year to
September, boosting profits, investment, jobs and tax receipts.
 This bonanza is the main reason the Reserve Bank of
Australia (RBA) has warned that interest rates will have to
rise again to control inflation, perhaps as soon as next month.
 ""This is real money that's washing through the economy and
giving nominal GDP growth in double-digits,"" said Su-Lin Ong, a
senior economist at RBC Capital Markets.
 ""It's the sort of positive income shock that policy-makers
ignore at their peril and it's why rates are likely to rise
sooner rather than later.""
 
 See special report on Australian economy:
 http://link.reuters.com/gas39p
 
 The RBA has already hiked six times since October and the
4.5 percent cash rate is far above most other developed
nations, some of which are considering easing policy further to
support flagging domestic demand.
 Much might depend on consumer price figures (CPI), due on
Oct. 27. The central bank expects underlying inflation to run
at an annual 2.5 to 2.75 percent in the third quarter, within
its long-term target band of 2 to 3 percent.
 Such an outcome could allow a further pause on rates in
November, but to forward-looking policy makers the problem will
be keeping prices tethered when they expect economic growth to
accelerate to 4 percent over the next couple of years.
Minutes of the central bank's policy meeting this month showed
board members were well aware of the challenge.
 ""Members concluded that interest rates would need to rise
at some point if the economy evolved in line with the central
scenario of a gradual tightening in resource utilisation.""
 The only question was timing, with some feeling the rise of
the local dollar to 28-year highs was a form of tightening that
offered space to wait a while before lifting rates.
Investors are pricing in around a 40 percent chance of a move
to 4.75 percent at the next meeting on November 2 ,
and a near 60 percent chance of a hike in December <0#YIB:>.
 A rise to 5.0 percent is priced in for the next 12 months,
though most analysts think that understates the risk.
 COUNTING ON ASIA
 Australia's good fortune owes much to demand from Asia,
which now takes over 70 percent of its exports and is growing
much faster than Europe or the United States. Just this week
China reported annual growth of 9.6 percent for the third
quarter.
 Friday's data showed prices for metal ore exports climbed
70 percent in the year to September, while coal rose 34
percent, gold 19 percent and gas 56 percent.
 In contrast, import prices rose a modest 0.7 percent in the
quarter and were down 1.5 percent for the year.
 As a result Australia's terms of trade, or the ratio of
export prices to import prices, climbed around 30 percent in
the year to September, the biggest rise in three decades.
 The surge has reversed the country's perennial trade
deficit, delivering a cumulative surplus of A$11.1 billion
between April and August.

 NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The dollar rebounded from
earlier losses in volatile trade on Thursday amid questions
about the extent of the Federal Reserve's economic stimulus
measures, while world stocks edged higher in tandem with the
U.S. currency's turnabout.
 U.S. data on jobless claims and regional business activity
reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will provide
another round of stimulus to boost the economy.
 New U.S. claims for unemployment benefits fell more than
expected last week but not enough to suggest much improvement
in the labor market, while the Philadelphia Federal Reserve
Bank's October business conditions index rose less than
expected.
 The data ""means that the Fed still has some work to do.
They need to take some more precautions against the downside
risk to the economy,"" said Mark Vitner, senior economist at
Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
 The dollar's volatility came just ahead of Friday and
Saturday meetings in South Korea of the Group of 20 finance
and central bank chiefs, who will try to hammer out an
agreement to manage currency, trade and macroeconomic
imbalances.
 China's latest data showed its economy was far from
overheating, suggesting Beijing's rate hike this week may be
enough for now to placate trading partners demanding a
stronger yuan to reduce trade imbalances. [ID:nTOE69K00X]
 U.S. earnings remained in the spotlight, with Caterpillar
Inc  reporting strong quarterly results and raising its
full-year revenue forecast. [ID:nN18273532]. Blue chips
McDonald's Corp  and Travelers Cos Inc  helped
lift the Dow after reporting better-than-expected results.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 38.60

 DOLLAR VOLATILITY
 Currency volatility rippled through markets after comments
from U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner late on
Wednesday in which he said major currencies were in balance.
The dollar jumped initially but the rally faded as investors
focused on the impact of a renewal of quantitative easing by
the Fed.
 But the size, shape and timing of the Fed's move have left
investors guessing, and nearly two months of speculation has
given them plenty of time to sell the dollar, pushing it to
extreme levels against some major currencies.
 ""Since it is clear that the direction is toward an
expansion of quantitative easing (in the United States), it is
hard to expect a sustained rebound in the dollar,"" said
Taisuke Tanaka, FX strategist at Nomura Securities in Tokyo.
 By midday, though, the dollar had managed a modest rebound
against the euro and a basket of major currencies.
 A G20 source, with direct knowledge of meeting
deliberations, said G20 officials are unlikely to reach an
accord rejecting currency devaluations and capping current
account balances. The source made the comment after U.S.
proposals ran into stiff opposition from several countries,
including India and China. [ID:nN21252058]
 The euro  was down 0.33 percent at $1.3918 from a
previous session close of $1.3964. The euro had earlier
climbed to a high around $1.4050, but failed to sustain gains
above key resistance at $1.40 for a second day this week. It
also came under pressure after U.S. stocks cut gains.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was up 0.25
percent at 81.32 from a previous session close of 81.12.
 The dollar was up against a basket of major currencies,
with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.38 percent at 77.461
from a previous session close of 77.171. The U.S. currency has
lost more than 10 percent against major currencies over the
past four months.
 While traders were far from convinced that G20 minsters
would solve once and for all their exchange-rate disagreements
at a weekend meeting, some said there was reluctance to take
extreme positions one way or the other.
 ""There's so much uncertainty, and I really think we'll see
a lot of position jockeying ahead of the weekend,"" said Greg
Salvaggio, vice president of trading at Tempus Consulting. ""I
wouldn't be surprised to see some dollar strength ahead.""
 U.S. government debt prices slipped on light volume as
traders await the Fed's decision.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 18/32, with the yield at 2.549 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was unchanged with the yield at 0.360
percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was down
39/32, with the yield at 3.962 percent.
 In the energy markets, crude oil  fell $1.98, or
2.40 percent, to settle at $80.56 per barrel following another
build in U.S. crude oil stocks last week. Meanwhile, in
commodities trading, spot gold prices  fell $20.40, or
1.52 percent, to $1,324.90 an ounce.

 NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rebounded in
volatile trade on Thursday after the euro failed again to hold
above $1.40 and as investors turned cautious before a G20
finance ministers meeting this weekend.
 The euro had earlier climbed to a high around $1.4050 but
failed to sustain gains above key resistance at $1.40 for a
second day this week. It also retreated after U.S. stocks came
under pressure intraday.
 The euro will likely stay in its recent range of between
$1.3650 and $1.4150 in the coming days as investors wrestle
with uncertainty over the size of expected U.S. monetary
easing, traders said. The Federal Reserve is expected to pump
more money into the economy next month, likely through direct
purchases of Treasury debt.
 ""There seems to be a willingness to sell euros above
$1.40,"" said John McCarthy, director of FX trading at ING
Capital in New York. ""We sort of ran into the top of the recent
trading ranges.""
 In late trading, the euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.3921
, after rising as high as $1.4051 on trading platform
EBS, with traders citing selling by Middle East accounts.
 European central banker Christian Noyer said there was no
problem with the euro at its current level, and it was an
""over-simplification"" to call the single currency overvalued.
See [ID:nLDE69K2GV]
 Many analysts note $1.40 as a key resistance level, which
draws corporate selling interest as companies repatriate their
earnings from Europe.
 Caution ahead of the G20 meeting also helped the dollar
regain ground, and analysts said any joint statements by
members agreeing not to devalue their currencies could spur a
dollar rebound. See Take-A-Look [ID:nTOE69K01G]
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said he sees no
reason for the dollar to sink further, saying major currencies
are ""roughly in alignment."" This echoed comments he made on
Monday that the United States would not devalue the dollar for
export advantage. [ID:nSGE69K04Q]
 While traders were far from convinced G20 ministers would
solve their exchange rate disagreements once and for all, some
said there was reluctance to take extreme positions.
""There's so much uncertainty and I really think we'll see a

if the G20 acknowledges that emerging Asia will have to reform
their exchange rate systems and embrace flexibility, it would
make a good start to address the global currency war.
 ""Such an outcome should trigger more flows into the short
dollar/Asia trade,"" he added.
 Against the yen, the dollar was up 0.3 percent at 81.34 yen
 after hitting a session low of 80.91, not far from a
15-year low at 80.84 set on EBS on Wednesday.
 Sterling  fell 0.9 percent to $1.5704 as weak retail
sales data stoked speculation that the Bank of England could
engage in more monetary easing.
 The prospects for more Fed easing have pushed the dollar
down about 7 percent against major currencies since September.

investors guessing, and nearly two months of speculation has
given them plenty of time to sell the dollar, pushing it to
extreme levels against some major currencies.

Thursday criticised the flagship news programs of a state

 The Agcom regulatory body said it would send complaints to
the widely-watched TG1 news broadcast and two other news
programmes shown by Mediaset channels over bias in favour of the
centre-right government over the July-September period.
 The news was immediately seized on by critics of Berlusconi
who have long accused the media tycoon of having excessive sway
over Italian television since he owns Mediaset and his
government appoints board members at state broadcaster RAI.
 ""The complaint by Agcom confirms that, even in terms of
basic rules, TG1 has by now become a voice of the government,
and among the most biased,"" said Paolo Gentiloni, who deals with
media issues for the opposition Democratic Party.
 A spokesman for Berlusconi's coalition, Daniele Capezzone,
said leftist lawmakers had forgotten that in the past the TG1
broadcast had favoured the left.
 Alleged bias towards Berlusconi's government in the media is
a frequent subject of controversy in Italy. 
 Last year, critics accused Berlusconi of intervening to get
positive publicity when RAI postponed a popular show to avoid
drawing away viewers from a rival show featuring the premier.

 By Ali Shuaib
 TRIPOLI, Oct 21 (Reuters) - France wants to do business with
Libya in areas including nuclear energy, a French minister said
on Thursday on a visit aimed at narrowing Italy's lead in
building lucrative trade ties with the oil exporter.
 Foreign investors have rushed to Libya since it emerged from
international isolation six years ago, with companies from
former colonial power Italy, as well as Turkey, South Korea and
Britain, taking a leading role.
 French Industry Minister Christian Estrosi arrived in the
Libyan capital on board a new Airbus passenger jet, one of a
consignment of aircraft which the company is contracted to
supply to state-owned carrier Libyan Airlines.
 The French minister signed an agreement with his Libyan
opposite number on trade cooperation, and also had talks with
Libyan Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmoudi.
 ""We hope that it (the agreement) will allow us to have a
closer understanding between Libya and the European Union,""
Estrosi, speaking through an interpreter, told Reuters.
 ""This agreement will lead to strategic cooperation with
Libya in the areas of transport, health, construction, oil and
gas and peaceful nuclear energy,"" he said.
 He did not give details about what form any nuclear
cooperation might take. France's Areva is a big player in the
international market for building and operating power-generating
nuclear reactors.
 Libya was for years subject to international sanctions but
these were lifted in 2004 after the country's leader, Muammar
Gaddafi, renounced illegal weapons programmes.
 The most high-profile French investors to date have been
Total, which is the operator in two oil fields and has several
exploration projects, and BNP Paribas, which acquired a stake in
Libya's Sahara bank in 2007.

 NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The dollar rebounded from
earlier losses on Thursday amid questions about the extent of
the Federal Reserve's economic stimulus measures, while world
stocks pared gains in tandem with the U.S. currency's
turnabout.
 U.S. data on jobless claims and regional business activity
reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will provide
another round of stimulus to boost the economy.
 New U.S. claims for unemployment benefits fell more than
expected last week but not enough to suggest much improvement
in the labor market, while the Philadelphia Federal Reserve
Bank's October business conditions index rose less than
expected.
 The data ""means that the Fed still has some work to do.
They need to take some more precautions against the downside
risk to the economy,"" said Mark Vitner, senior economist at
Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
 The dollar's volatility came just ahead of Friday and
Saturday meetings in South Korea of the Group of 20 finance and
central bank chiefs, who will try to hammer out an agreement to
manage currency, trade and macroeconomic imbalances.
 China's latest data showed its economy was far from

 DOLLAR VOLATILITY
 Currency volatility rippled through markets after comments
from U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner late on Wednesday
in which he said major currencies were in balance. The dollar
jumped initially but the rally faded as investors focused on
the impact of a renewal of quantitative easing by the Fed.
 But the size, shape and timing of the Fed's move have left
investors guessing, and nearly two months of speculation has
given them plenty of time to sell the dollar, pushing it to
extreme levels against some major currencies.
 ""Since it is clear that the direction is toward an
expansion of quantitative easing (in the United States), it is
hard to expect a sustained rebound in the dollar,"" said Taisuke
Tanaka, FX strategist at Nomura Securities in Tokyo.
 By midday, though, the dollar had managed a modest rebound
against the euro and a basket of major currencies.
 A G20 source, with direct knowledge of meeting
deliberations, said G20 officials are unlikely to reach an
accord rejecting currency devaluations and capping current
account balances. The source made the comment after U.S.
proposals ran into stiff opposition from several countries,
including India and China.
 The euro  was down 0.2 percent at $1.3932 against the
dollar as investors sold some euros in volatile trading.
 The U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> was up 0.28 percent at 77.385
from a previous session close of 77.171. Against the Japanese
yen, the dollar  was up 0.16 percent at 81.26 from a
previous session close of 81.120.
 The U.S. currency has lost more than 10 percent against
major currencies over the past four months.
 While traders were far from convinced that G20 minsters
would solve once and for all their exchange-rate disagreements
at a weekend meeting, some said there was reluctance to take
extreme positions one way or the other.
 ""There's so much uncertainty, and I really think we'll see
a lot of position jockeying ahead of the weekend,"" said Greg
Salvaggio, vice president of trading at Tempus Consulting. ""I
wouldn't be surprised to see some dollar strength ahead.""
 U.S. government debt prices slipped on light volume as
traders await the Fed's decision.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 12/32, with the yield at 2.525 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was down 1/32, with the yield at
0.3588 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was
down 17/32, with the yield at 3.922 percent.
 In energy and commodities markets, crude oil  fell
$2.00, or 2.4 percent, to $80.54 per barrel following another
build in U.S. crude oil stocks last week, and spot gold
fell $14.50, or 1.08 percent, to $1,330.80 an ounce.

* Washington ratchets up pressure on Turkey over Iran trade
 
 By Tulay Karadeniz and Ibon Villelabeitia
 ANKARA, Oct 21 (Reuters) - A top U.S. government official
prodded Turkey on Thursday to enforce international sanctions
against Iran, increasing pressure on Ankara to scale back its
flourishing trade ties with its neighbour.
 ""All we want is the sanctions to be imposed throughout the
world,"" Stuart Levey, the U.S. treasury undersecretary for
terrorism and financial intelligence, told Turkish broadcaster
NTV after meeting Turkish government and banking officials for
two days to discuss U.S. and U.N. sanctions.
 ""The purpose of this visit is to maximise our chances that
the sanctions imposed on Iran are successful,"" Levey was quoted
by the Hurriyet Daily News as telling a group of journalists.
 ""Turkey of course plays an important role given its
proximity to Iran as a neighbour. Implementation of the
sanctions here is as important as it is everywhere.""
 A U.S. delegation visited Turkey in August to deliver a
similar message to the country's banks.
 Turkey, a NATO member that aspires to join the European
Union as well as a secular Muslim nation straddling Europe and
Asia, has deepened economic and financial ties with Iran despite
Western efforts to put the squeeze on the Islamic Republic.
 The U.N. Security Council, United States and European Union
have tightened sanctions on Iran over its uranium enrichment
programme, which Washington fears will be used to develop atomic
bombs. Tehran says it wants peaceful nuclear energy only.
 Turkey is bound by U.N. sanctions despite voting against
them along with fellow rotating Security Council member Brazil
and has said it is not obliged to follow non-U.N. sanctions.
 But under U.S. law, Turkish banks with business in the
United States could face U.S. penalties for dealing with Iranian
firms blacklisted by Washington.
 Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said last month Turkey wanted
to triple its trade with Iran -- which is Turkey's second
largest supplier of gas -- at a time of growing international
isolation of the Islamic Republic.
 
 TURKISH BANKS
 On Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan said in
Washington that Turkish banks had become hesitant about dealing
with Iran, but Turkey had left decisions on whether to pull back
following U.S. and European sanctions up to them.
 While saying Turkey would comply with U.N. resolutions,
Babacan said Ankara had not provided guidelines to its banking
sector on how to deal with financial sanctions imposed by the
Washington and the EU.
 He also reiterated Turkey's position that only diplomacy,
not sanctions, would change Iran's stance.
 Tehran has defied a series of Security Council resolutions
demanding that it shelve enrichment and open up to U.N. nuclear
inspectors in exchange for trade and diplomatic benefits.
 Levey, in the NTV interview, said: ""Deputy Prime Minister
Ali Babacan said Turkey will abide by the decision of the U.N.
Security Council. We consider this as significant.""
 Despite Ankara's permissive stance towards Turkish firms
dealing with Iran, Mustafa Koc, chairman of Turkey's largest
energy-to-banking conglomerate Koc Holding, said Turkish
companies were starting to feel the U.S. pressure.
 Tupras, Europe's fourth biggest oil refiner and 51 percent
owned by Koc, announced in August that it was no longer selling
petroleum products to Iran.
 ""Tupras' banking transactions are made in U.S. We are doing
business with American Ford and Fiat, and indirectly with
Chrysler. We simply can not take such a risk,"" Koc told Hurriyet
daily earlier this week.
 Mark Fitzpatrick, an Iran expert at the London-based
International Institute for Strategic Studies, said Turkey was
out of synch with world powers regarding Iran, undermining
efforts to persuade Tehran to comply with international demands.
 ""I think it's one point to talk to the neighbours, to have
good relations, to have trade that is not restricted by the U.N.
sanctions, but it's another to send signals to Iran that the
outside world is split,"" he told Reuters in an interview.

 * Interest rate differentials continue to favor euro
 * Dollar reverses gains made on Geithner comments in WSJ
 * Asian demand helps euro vs dollar
(Updates bullets, prices)
 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The euro was slightly higher
against the dollar on Thursday in choppy trade as investors
wrestled with uncertainty over the size and shape of expected
U.S. monetary easing.
 With unemployment hovering around 9.5 percent, the Federal
Reserve is widely expected to pump more money into the economy,
likely through direct purchases of Treasury debt.
 Reflecting this, the spread between three-month interbank
dollar and euro rates has steadily widened in the euro's favor,
making it more attractive to global investors.
 But the size, shape and timing of the Fed's move has left
investors guessing, and nearly two months of speculation has
given them plenty of time to sell the dollar, pushing it to
extreme levels against some major currencies.
 ""There is a touch of apprehension in the market, and
concerns are building about how hard the Fed's going to hit and
what the market reaction will be,"" said C.J. Gavsie, managing
director of FX sales at BMO Capital Markets. ""So we've got to
be cautious about getting too bearish on the dollar.""
 The euro rose as high as $1.4050 overnight but retreated
in the New York session, with traders citing selling by Middle
East accounts. It was lately up 0.1 percent to $1.3973.
 The European Central Bank, in contrast to the Federal
Reserve, has talked about winding up some of its stimulus
programs. Euro zone governments are preparing a tough slate of
spending cuts and tax increases to get public finances in
order. The Obama administration says the time is not right for
belt tightening as the U.S. recovery is very fragile.
 Traders said Asian demand helped boost the single currency.
Many Asian central banks have been investing their proceeds
from intervention in their currency markets into euros.
 Against the yen, the dollar continued to hover near a
15-year low and was last trading flat at 81.16.
 Sterling fell 0.5 percent to $1.5753 as weak retail sales
data stoked speculation that the Bank of England could engage
in more monetary easing.
 G20 LINGERS
 Earlier, the dollar rose after U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner said major currencies were in balance, but
traders seized on its brief bounce as a chance to sell it
again, with Asian accounts cited as large buyers.
 Analysts argued Geithner's comments did not mark a
significant change in U.S. policy.
 ""What Geithner said was not targeted at the U.S. dollar. He
was making his position clear before the G20 that the U.S.
would not fight everybody on FX, just China,"" said Ulrich
Leuchtmann, currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 Traders were far from convinced G20 ministers would solve
once and for all their exchange rate disagreements at a weekend
meeting. Some said there was reluctance to take extreme
positions one way or the other.
 ""There's so much uncertainty and I really think we'll see a
lot of position jockeying ahead of the weekend,"" said Greg
Salvaggio, vice president of trading at Tempus Consulting. ""I
wouldn't be surprised to see some dollar strength ahead.""
 But Chris Turner, chief currency strategist at ING, said
that if the G20 acknowledges that emerging Asia will have to
reform their exchange rate systems and embrace flexibility, it
would make a good start to address the global currency war.
 ""Such an outcome should trigger more flows into the short
dollar/Asia trade,"" he added.

 * Other countries should develop rare earth production
 * Easing dual-use restrictions would boost U.S. exports

(Rewrites with details, background, quotes, byline)
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Oct 21 (Reuters) - China's new five-year-plan will
not bring any rapid change in export quotas for rare earth
metals required worldwide for high-tech products, a senior
Chinese trade official said on Thursday.
 Sun Zhenyu, ambassador to the World Trade Organization, told
Reuters Insider that China's own stocks of the rare metals, for
which it is the dominant supplier, were depleting fast and that
Beijing had to conserve them.
 ""I think there will be probably not a very quick change in
the export quota mechanism of rare earths,"" Sun said in an
interview on the trade implications of the five-year-plan,
unveiled this month.
 The plan is the blueprint for the five years from 2011 for
what will become the world's biggest economy as China shifts the
emphasis to domestic consumption from exports. [ID:nTOE69H036]
 China's policy on rare earths -- used to make parts for
vehicles, computers, mobile phones and missiles -- has been at
the top of the trade agenda since reports that China had halted
shipments to Japan during a territorial dispute. [ID:nTOE69J03D]
 Chinese export restrictions on rare earths have already been
challenged at the WTO by the United States, European Union and
Mexico, which say the policy helps Chinese producers that use
the minerals at the expense of foreign competitors.
 The Commerce Ministry denied on Wednesday a report that the
government planned to slash export quotas next year.
 China, which now provides more than 90 percent of the
world's supplies of rare earths, says it has to conserve them
for environmental reasons and because they are disappearing.
 Sun said China's resources had fallen to 30 percent of the
world total from 33 percent in 1996 and would last only another
15-20 years.
 Curtailing production would affect both foreign customers
and domestic producers, he said.
 Rising prices and concerns about Chinese supply have
prompted companies in the United States and other countries to
reopen mines that had been considered uneconomic.
 
 U.S. EXPORTS
 ""We would like that our partners would also start working on
some kind of production of rare earths of their own resources,""
Sun said. ""So we are very glad to see that some of our trading
partners are starting to do so.""
 Sun also said he was hopeful the United States would soon
relax restrictions on high-tech products that have both
commercial and military applications -- a long-standing request
of Beijing.
 Under the new five-year-plan China will develop several
strategic industries such as alternative energy and new
materials, for which it will need to import high-tech equipment
from the U.S. and elsewhere.
 Sun said there were positive signs that the U.S. business
community was pushing the government to relax controls on this
dual-use technology and that eventually China would be able to
buy these goods from America.
 ""That will have a major impact on the trade balance between
China and the U.S.,"" Sun said.
 The United States has an advantage in high-tech goods, but
they made up a relatively small proportion of U.S. exports to
China. Easing restrictions could boost U.S. exports to China by
$90 billion a year, he said.
 President Barack Obama has called for the restrictions to be
streamlined as part of his plan to double U.S. exports.

 Turkey will invest some $3.2 billion to develop the
Mansuriyah field near the Iranian border alongside Kuwait Energy
Company and South Korea's Kogas, and the southern Siba field
with Kuwait Energy, Turkey's energy minister said.
 The winners of Wednesday's auction will have to brave
violence and political uncertainty to build infrastructure and
pipelines for the gas which Iraq wants used for domestic
consumption, but there is potential for export later.
 
 WHY IS TURKEY INTERESTED IN IRAQI GAS?
 Before the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq was Turkey's second biggest
trading partner after Germany, so in many ways Ankara is only
seeking to regain ground lost during 20 years of sanctions, war
and instability in its southern neighbour.
 Despite the global economic woes, the Turkish government
predicts its economy will grow by 6.8 percent this year, among
the fastest in the world, so Turkey needs to increase its oil
and gas supplies to keep pace with that growth.
 Gaining early access to Iraqi gas, should put Turkey in a
better position to import gas from Iraq once the sector becomes
more mature.
 While Baghdad wants the gas for domestic use for now, Thamir
al-Ghadhban, a top adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri
al-Maliki, said on the sidelines of the auction: ""I don't see a
problem in the future with exporting gas.""
 Beyond its burgeoning domestic needs, Turkey has ambitions
to become a regional energy hub. 
 Turkey sees Iraq as the only eastern neighbour with
""tangible near-time gas export growth potential,"" IHS senior
Middle East Energy analyst Samuel Ciszuk wrote in a note on
Thursday.
 Other neighbours face even greater problems, including
sanctions on Iran and the difficulty of finding a solution to
the Caspian Sea maritime border dispute to unlock potential
large-scale Turkmen gas exports westwards, he said.
 
 WHY IS TURKEY AN INCREASING GAS HUB?
 While it has scarcely any oil and gas reserves of its own,
Turkey is seeking to leverage its geographical position between
Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Russia to link energy
producers and consumers with a web of pipelines.
 Turkey already gets Russian natural gas through the Blue
Stream pipeline under the Black Sea, another pipeline through
the Balkans, and gas from links from Azerbaijan and Iran.
 Adding Iraqi gas would also strengthen the economic case for
the proposed Nabucco pipeline connecting Turkey with Europe and
easing European dependence on Russian gas supplies.
 ""Nabucco is very important for us,"" said TPAO vice president
Besim Sisman after the Iraq gas auction.
 
 WHO ARE TURKEY'S EXISTING PARTNERS?
 Turkey is supposed to import 10 billion cubic metres of gas
from Iran each year -- one third of its total consumption.
Russia supplies up to 16 bcm a year via Blue Stream and another
14 bcm from a pipeline through Romania and Bulgaria, according
to data from Turkey's state gas company Botas.
 It also receives some 6.6 bcm through the South Caucasus
pipeline from Azerbaijan, via Georgia and smaller quantities of
liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Algeria and Nigeria.
 Turkey re-exports a small amount of gas to Greece which
could then be linked to a proposed pipeline to Italy, but the
big prize for Turkey is Nabucco, a project that also has the
backing of the European Union.
 The Nabucco consortium, whose shareholders include Hungary's
MOL, Romania's Transgaz, Bulgaria's Bulgargaz, Turkey's Botas,
Germany's RWE and Austria's OMV, aims to build a pipeline with
31 bcm capacity.
 The shareholders opted against linking the project to Iran
due to international sanctions, hence the importance of securing
Iraqi gas for the $11 billion project.
 
 HAVE SANCTIONS AFFECTED TURKEY'S GAS TRADE WITH IRAN?
 The sanctions target companies involved in the trade of
crude products such as gasoline and diesel with Iran, so gas
exports to Turkey -- Tehran's only gas export market -- are
unaffected.
 Iran holds the second-largest gas reserves in the world and
Turkey has repeatedly said it supports the idea of using Iranian
gas for the Nabucco pipeline, but due to sanctions the European
Union has reacted coolly to the idea.
 Some analysts say additional infrastructure between Turkey
and Iran, such as a planned 110 million cubic metre gas
pipeline, would add muscle to Turkey's proposals.
 But so far Iran has not always managed to fulfil its export
commitments to Turkey and supplies have been hobbled by cold
weather, disputes over prices and explosions in the pipeline.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar on Thursday in choppy trade as investors wrestled with
uncertainty over the size and shape of expected U.S. monetary
easing.
 With unemployment hovering around 9.5 percent, the Federal
Reserve is widely expected to pump more money into the economy,
likely through direct purchases of Treasury debt.
 Reflecting this, the spread between three-month interbank
dollar and euro rates has steadily widened in the euro's favor,
making it more attractive to global investors.
 But the size, shape and timing of the Fed's move has left
investors guessing, and nearly two months of speculation has
given them plenty of time to sell the dollar, pushing it to
extreme levels against some major currencies.
 ""There is a touch of apprehension in the market, and
concerns are building about how hard the Fed's going to hit and
what the market reaction will be,"" said C.J. Gavsie, managing
director of FX sales at BMO Capital Markets. ""So we've got to
be cautious about getting too bearish on the dollar.""
 The euro rose as high as $1.4050 overnight but retreated
early in the New York session, with traders citing selling by
Middle East accounts. It was last up 0.4 percent at $1.4020.
 The European Central Bank, in contrast to the United
States, has talked more about winding up some of its stimulus
programs, while euro zone governments are preparing a tough
slate of spending cuts and tax increases to get public finances
in order.
 Traders said Asian demand helped boost the single currency.
Many Asian central banks have been investing their proceeds
from intervention in their currency markets into euros.
 Against the yen, the dollar continued to hover near a
15-year low and was last trading flat at 81.12.
 Sterling fell 0.4 percent to $1.5775 as weak retail sales
data stoked speculation that the Bank of England could engage
in more monetary easing.
 G20 LINGERS
 Earlier, the dollar rose after U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner said major currencies were in balance, but
traders seized on its brief bounce as a chance to sell it
again, with Asian accounts cited as large buyers.
 Analysts argued Geithner's comments did not mark a
significant change in U.S. policy.
 ""What Geithner said was not targeted at the U.S. dollar. He
was making his position clear before the G20 that the U.S.
would not fight everybody on FX, just China,"" said Ulrich
Leuchtmann, currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
While traders were far from convinced that G20 minsters
would solve once and for all their exchange rate disagreements
at a weekend meeting, some said there was reluctance to take
extreme positions one way or the other.
 ""There's so much uncertainty and I really think we'll see a
lot of position jockeying ahead of the weekend,"" said Greg
Salvaggio, vice president of trading at Tempus Consulting. ""I
wouldn't be surprised to see some dollar strength ahead.""
 But Chris Turner, chief currency strategist at ING, said
that if the G20 acknowledges that emerging Asia will have to
reform their exchange rate systems and embrace flexibility, it
would make a good start to address the global currency war.
 ""Such an outcome should trigger more flows into the short
dollar/Asia trade,"" he added.

 By Elena Fabrichnaya and Daria Korsunskaya
 MOSCOW, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank is likely
to allow the rouble greater flexibility by widening its trading
band further, but floating the currency freely would be a
political decision, a senior monetary official said.
 ""The question of moving the rouble towards a free float --
this is a political decision,"" Sergei Shvetsov, a central bank
board member, told a meeting of lawmakers and central bankers at
the Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament.
 ""The exchange rate policy (for 2011-2013) suggests a further
widening of the floating corridor ... a scaled-down amount of
interventions and potentially the abolition of this corridor if
such decision is made.""
 The central bank needs a free-floating rouble to move
towards a policy of inflation targeting and abandon the prior
policy of targeting exchange rates.
 However, the central bank's move in this direction may face
some opposition from other policymakers.
 Speaking at a conference on Thursday, head of the Economy
Ministry's forecasting department Oleg Zasov said the ministry
was always cautious about inflation targeting adding that the
central bank should not ""leave the rouble in the hands of
speculators"".
 ""The biggest threat from inflation targeting in a long run
is that the rouble may be overvalued. We think it is important
that the central bank does not allow a further firming in the
rouble,"" Zasov said.
 The Russian currency on Thursday hit fresh 2010 lows against
the euro  and the dollar-euro basket  that the
central bank uses as a reference point for its foreign exchange
policy. [ID:nLDE69K0LB]
 ""The predictability of the rate has significantly
decreased,"" Shvetsov said.
 In recent weeks, the central bank has bought some $3.3
billion to keep the rouble within its trading ranges, he added.
 Finance and central bank chiefs from Russia and other G20
countries are meeting on Friday and Saturday in Gyeongju, South
Korea, seeking agreement on a common path to manage currency,
trade and macroeconomic imbalances ahead of a leadership meeting
in Seoul next month. [ID:nTOE69K01G]
 
 NO LIQUIDITY SHORTAGE
 Russia's central bank widened the basket's floating corridor
to four roubles from three on Oct. 13 in a move seen as an
initial step towards a free-floating currency. [ID:nLDE69C0TW]
 The change suggests new boundaries at around 32.90 and 36.90
roubles against the basket.
 Russia has gradually allowed more flexibility for the
rouble, which is largely driven by oil and gas prices, as it
seeks to shift the key focus of its policy to targeting
inflation rather than the exchange rate in coming years.
 The local banking system should suffer no liquidity shortage
in the next few months, Shvetsov said, adding that it would
support stability on the money market.
 ""There is no basis for money market interest rates to jump
away from our minimum 2.5 percent rate early next year,""
Shvetsov said, referring to the bank's overnight deposit rate.
 Russia's interbank overnight money rates have held at around
2.5 percent since May .
 Liquidity in the banking sector, including both deposit and
the less-flexible but higher-yielding correspondent accounts,
has stayed at comfortable levels between $800 billion roubles
($26 billion) and $1 trillion roubles in recent months,
according to central bank data.
 
 BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
 Relatively high oil prices [O/R] in 2010 have allowed Russia
to enjoy a healthy current account surplus, benefiting the
balance of payments account, Shvetsov said.
 But next year the balance of payments surplus is forecast to
decline to $46 billion from $73 billion in 2010.
 ""Balance of payments will weaken ... because of a rise in
imports, both, consumer and industrial,"" Shvetsov said.
 The central bank has taken the oil price of $75 per barrel
as the basis for its 2011 monetary policy.
 ""We are expecting that oil prices will continue in the range
of $75--$80 per barrel,"" Shvetsov said.

from the Group of 20 leading economies are unlikely to reach any

Thursday.
 The source said talk of such commitments being made at this
week's meeting of finance ministers and central bankers had
possibly leaked from a working paper circulated by some of the

with the Wall Street Journal. Separately, there was speculation
countries would be asked to commit to limits on current account
balances.
 ""It's a position paper of the U.S. and some other countries
which they have converted into a working paper. The actual
drafting of the communique will only begin Friday night after

bank governors,"" the source said.
 The final communique would make a rather ""subdued"" reference
to currencies and current account balances,"" he said.
 He said India, Germany and some other countries had told the
United States on Thursday that there was no point in setting
artificial caps on the current account balances.
 ""We have also opposed any kind of what they are saying should
be 'global fx norms'. Rather we as in the emerging economies
including India, China as well as Germany have suggested that
there should be structural reforms and currency and current

package.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the dollar
on Thursday as investors piled into the single European currency
in the belief that the interest rate differential with its U.S.
counterpart will continue to widen.
 The dollar relinquished gains made earlier in the day as
investors reckoned comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner ahead of a G20 finance ministers meeting may not have
warranted a brief jump in the U.S. currency.
 The dollar stayed under broad selling pressure, hovering
near a 15-year low against the yen as it continued to take a
beating on speculation the Federal Reserve may implement more
dollar-negative quantitative easing next month.
 Expectations of more Fed easing have driven three-month
interbank dollar rates lower. At the same time, euro zone rates
have risen to their highest since July last year, widening the
spread between the two.
 Some analysts said this widening spread, which indicates
U.S. and euro zone rates are expected to diverge further, was
helping push the euro higher.
 ""The majority of the market sees a positive interest rate
differential in the euro given the difference in euro and dollar
money market rates,"" said Stephen Gallo, head of markets
analysis at Schneider Foreign Exchange.
 ""There is an ongoing diversification away from the dollar,
and that's increasing demand for euros,"" he added.
 The euro was at $1.4030 having climbed to a session high of
$1.4050 according to Reuters data. Technical traders highlighted
the euro's rally stalled at the 76.4 percent retracement of its
decline from this month's high of $1.4157 to yesterday's low at
$1.3696.
Traders said Asian demand helped boost the single currency.
Many Asian central banks have been investing their proceeds from
intervention in their currency markets into euros.
 
 G20 IN FOCUS
 Their steady intervention to drive down their currencies
against a weakening U.S. dollar has led to some speculation that
an agreement may be in the offing this weekend at the G20 meet.
 Finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the Group of
20 meet on Friday in South Korea to discuss a common path on
managing currency, trade and economic imbalances. G20 leaders
will meet in Seoul next month.
 But traders said an agreement on currencies was unlikely
this week given the ongoing race for some countries to weaken
their currencies, and that the market was positioned for more
dollar selling heading into the meeting.
 Chris Turner, chief currency strategist at ING said that
should the G-20 acknowledge that emerging Asia will have to
reform their exchange rate systems and embrace flexibility, it
would make a good start to address the global currency war.
 ""Such an outcome should trigger more flows into the short
dollar/Asia trade,"" he added.
 The dollar index slipped 0.3 percent to 76.937, staying near
a 10-month low of 76.144 hit last week.
 The dollar fell as low as 80.93 yen on Reuters data, pulling
back from the day's high of 81.82 yen and closing in on 80.84
yen hit on Wednesday, its weakest since mid-1995.
 The market is wary that Japanese authorities could intervene
to slow the yen's rise again, after they did so on Sept. 15,
selling yen for the first time in more than six years.
 The dollar reversed gains made after the Wall Street Journal
quoted Geithner as saying major currencies were roughly in
alignment and he would use the G20 meet to move towards norms on
currency policy and rebalance the global economy.
 Investors initially took his comments as a cue to buy the
dollar, but analysts argued Geithner's comments did not mark a

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - World stocks ticked higher and
the dollar slipped on Thursday against a backdrop of nerves
about political currency machinations as well as caution about
corporate earnings.
 Wall Street looked set to open higher.
 Some fears about China's recent rate hike ebbed after a
batch of data showing a slowdown in economic growth, albeit to a
still healthy level, was taken as a sign that there may not be a
spate of future tightenings.
 Investor focus was on the Friday and Saturday meeting of
Group of 20 finance and central bank chiefs in South Korea. It
is expected to try to reach agreement on a common path to manage
currency, trade and macroeconomic imbalances.
 Effective dollar devaluation stemming from an expected
renewal of a quantitative easing, or asset-buying, programme by
the U.S. Federal Reserve has spread tension across markets over
a potential currency war, with Washington pushing China to
revalue its yuan.
 The accompanying volatility was on display on Thursday when
The Wall Street Journal quoted U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner as saying major currencies were roughly in alignment.
 He also said he would use the G20 meeting to advance efforts
to rebalance the world economy and move toward norms on currency
policy.
 This initially lifted the dollar broadly. But it soon fell
back as investors calculated reaction to the report had been
overdone.
 The dollar was later down 0.4 percent against a basket of
major currencies. It was closing in on 15-year lows against the
yen and the euro was up a half a percent above $1.40.
 ""Since it is clear that the direction is toward an expansion
of quantitative easing (in the United States), it is hard to
expect a sustained rebound in the dollar,"" said Taisuke Tanaka,
FX strategist at Nomura Securities in Tokyo.
 The U.S. currency is down more than 10 percent against major
currencies over the past four months.
 
 DEFENSIVE
 Stock markets were generally higher, renewing a rally that
have been underway since September. 
 The MSCI all-country world index was up 0.3 percent on the
day with its emerging market component leading the way, up 0.6
percent.
 MSCI's emerging market index has gained 12 percent this
year.
 European stocks also rose on Thursday, but uncertainties
about company earnings prompted investors to take shelter in
more defensive shares.
The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.4
percent.
 Investors were eyeing more earnings results. Morgan Stanley
reported a surprise loss on Wednesday and Credit Suisse
reported on Thursday that its third-quarter net profit tumbled
74 percent to miss forecasts.
 ""Caution is still a watchword and we certainly remain very
data-sensitive,"" said Keith Bowman, equities analyst at
Hargreaves Lansdown.
 He added, however, that there was a general mood of optimism
on stock markets because China's economy seemed to be in
reasonable shape and central banks were keeping liquidity
flowing.

 * Sees 20 bln yen savings from lower fixed, other costs
 By Chang-Ran Kim, Asia autos correspondent
 TOKYO, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Mazda Motor Corp is aiming to step
up sales, cost cuts and other measures to offset an additional
negative impact of about 40 billion yen ($493 million) from
foreign exchange on its operating profit this business year, its
chief executive said.
 CEO Takashi Yamanouchi said that with the dollar and euro
both far weaker than Mazda's assumptions of 90 yen and 125 yen,
respectively, currencies could knock off 40 billion yen more from
operating profit this business year than the company had
initially forecast.
 Yamanouchi said he expects global sales to exceed Mazda's
target of 1.27 million vehicles and profitability per car to
improve through various measures such as raising sticker prices,
and those two factors would hopefully lead to a 20 billion yen
lift in profit. He wanted further reductions in fixed and other
costs to contribute another 20 billion yen.
 ""With (exchange rates where they are), we could see an impact
of roughly 40 billion yen, and our profits would vanish,""
Yamanouchi told a small group of reporters on Thursday.
 ""The strong yen is uncontrollable, but we're trying to
control what we can.""
 Yamanouchi said he would discuss further details when Mazda
announces its second-quarter financial results on Oct. 29.
 Mazda has forecast an operating profit of 30 billion yen for
the year to March 31. The dollar was trading around 81 yen and
the euro was around 113.50 yen on Thursday.
 With the highest export ratio, Mazda is the most exposed
Japanese car maker to currency fluctuations. In the latest
business year, Mazda built 72 percent of its vehicles in Japan,
exporting 78 percent of its domestic production.
 Yamanouchi said that while sales conditions in Japan, the
United States and Europe were difficult, sales were exceeding
plans in China and the rest of the world.
 In Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, sales were trending at
three times last year's levels, he said, keeping Mazda's joint
venture factory with Ford Motor Co in Thailand working well above
normal capacity.
 ""We (Mazda brand) have 50,000 units a year of capacity for
passenger cars or about 4,000 units a month at the plant, and in
October we built 6,000 to 7,000 units with overtime and such,""
Yamanouchi said.
 ""Even then, we have a back order of two months' worth of
production.""
 He said Mazda was studying how to build more cars in
Thailand, but ruled out a new factory anywhere in the world at
least until it completes a midterm business plan in March 2016.
 Yamanouchi has said Mazda has enough production capacity to
meet a global sales target of 1.7 million vehicles in the year to
March 2016, except for a slight shortfall in China.

 Traders said Asian demand was helping to boost the single

 Analysts said some emerging market countries may be allowing
their currencies to appreciate versus the dollar to avoid being
singled out as currency manipulators at the G20 meeting, and
were likely to be offsetting that rise by buying euros.

economic outlook for the Asia-Pacific come after a surprise
interest rate hike by China this week and recent interventions
by Japan, South Korea and other countries to stem their surging
currencies.
 ""Macroprudential measures have appropriately been taken in
many regional economies to minimize these risks, but a further
tightening of monetary policy conditions may be needed,
including through greater exchange rate appreciation,"" the
report said.
 ""A faster withdrawal of fiscal stimulus would also help
guard against the risks of overheating and a buildup of
financial imbalances.""
 Ample global liquidity and the relatively robust growth and
low public debt in Asia should continue to fuel capital flows
to the region, the IMF said, as depressed interest rates and
sluggish growth in the West prompt investors to seek higher
yields elsewhere.
 The inflows have pushed the yen  up 14 percent
against the dollar so far this year and the Thai baht  up
11 percent despite policymakers' attempts to slow their climb.
 Foreign exchange movements, including the relatively slight
gain of over 2 percent in China's yuan , is likely to be
a key topic for a G20 finance meeting in South Korea this week,
as the U.S. pushes Beijing for faster appreciation.
[ID:nTOE69K01G]
 Anoop Singh, a director at the IMF's Asia and Pacific
department, said Asia needed to tackle the short-term effects
of capital inflows leading to excess liquidity, while
channeling them to infrastructure and other investments in the
long-run.
 ""Asia has comprehensive tools to tackle short term
(effects). Asia has room for further measures,"" said Singh at a
news conference in Jakarta.
 Indonesia, one of the few countries in the region to leave
its interest rates on hold this year after slashing them during
the financial crisis, announced measures last month to soak up
liquidity by lifting bank's reserve requirements.
 Thailand has been wary of imposing controls on inflows
after measures in 2006 led to a slide in its stock market,
though Brazil has taken aggressive action such as raising a tax
on bond purchases by foreigners to curb a rally in the real
.
 SLOWING PACE
 The recent gains in the yen, hurting the nation's
exporters, may signal lower GDP and export growth for Japan,
the IMF said in the report.
 Economic growth rates for much of the rest of Asia,
meanwhile, are expected to settle into a more sustainable pace.
 ""During the second half of 2010, economic activity has
moderated toward a more sustainable pace, although it remains
robust,"" its report said.
 ""In particular, industrial production and export growth
rates have started to moderate.""
 Japan's government said on Tuesday that the economy was now
at a standstill, adding that futher pressure could tip it back
into recession. [ID:nTOE69I06J]
 Overall GDP growth in Asia is seen at 8 percent in 2010,
before moderating slightly to 7 percent in 2011, the IMF
forecast. Both projections are an upward revision of nearly 1
percentage point from April estimates.
 ""A notable aspect of the outlook is that the large,
domestic-demand-driven economies -- China, India, and Indonesia
-- are set to grow particularly rapidly.""
 China's economy is projected to grow 10.5 percent this year
and 9.50 percent in 2011, but led by more domestic consumption,
while India is seen expanding by 9.75 percent this year and 8.5
percent in 201l.
 ""Should global conditions worsen, however, the region has
the room to delay the normalisation of policy stances,"" the IMF
said.

1491,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2010 06:04AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Emerging market play complicated by FX shifts," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The passive devaluation of the
U.S. dollar and the potential for emerging market currency
appreciation are changing the playing field for investors
seeking to tap into Asian and Latin American growth.
 To date, the ""currency war"" has done little to cool
investors' ardour for emerging markets. Such plays, indeed,
helped drive world stocks to more than two year highs last week.
 But shifts in currency rates, epitomised by the dollar's
recent four-month fall of more than 15 percent against major
currencies <.DXY>, can impact everything from product demand and
costs to borrowing to the repatriation of profits.
 So the potential for a new currency landscape is set to make
life more complicated for investors, particularly those seeking
to buy large developed-market multinational equities with solid
exposure as proxies for emerging markets.
 There will be an array of positive and negative factors to
balance.
 Consider, for example, the impact of a strengthening yuan on
U.S. and European companies plans to make direct investments or
joint ventures in China. If Washington gets its way and
persuades Beijing to revalue, China will get more expensive.
 This would mean additional costs to companies whose plans
have not yet been implemented. But the flip side for investors
is that companies with an existing presence would have a
competitive edge.
 ""Anyone who wants to invest in China after a revaluation has
taken place has to pay more in his own currency to do that,""
said Karl Sauvant, executive director of the Vale Columbia
Centre on Sustainable Investment, in New York.
 ""That is why those who are there (already) would have an
advantage.""
 Sauvant reckons the prospects for currency appreciation in
emerging markets may prompt companies with investment plans to
bring them forward -- another bottom-line cost implication for
equity investors to grapple with.
 
 HIGHER RETURNS
 In theory, a developed-market company with high exposure to
emerging markets should benefit from depreciation of its home
currency in two ways -- because their goods are cheaper and
because the new exchange rate boosts their foreign profits.
 But this tends to reflect an old model of business for many
companies as it assumes they produce goods at home and then
export them.
 Many large companies now produce their goods in situ.
Volkswagen , for example, has nine production
facilities in China and plans by 2014 to have doubled its China
production capacity to 3 million vehicles a year.
 For companies with manufacturing presences in countries with
appreciating currencies, the exchange rate effect will be muted.
They may even find that the deflationary impact of a higher rate
will weaken the very domestic demand that they are there to
exploit in the first place.
 Ranged against that, however, would be reduced costs for raw
materials such as oil in emerging market plants because these
are for the most part priced in dollars.
 And then there is the windfall of profits reported back to
investors at home, converted by a favourable exchange rate.
 ""If emerging market currencies appreciate significantly,
then the portion of earnings increases,"" said Tristan Hanson,
strategist at Jersey-based wealth manager Ashburton.
 Looking at VW again, imagine what a 10 percent appreciation
of the yuan against the euro would do to the 395 million euros
of operating profit the firm got from China joint ventures in
2009.
 That profit, incidentally, was 20 percent of Volkswagen
group's total operating profit for the year -- underlining the
exposure such firms can have.
 
 WHAT NOW?
 It is not, of course, as clear cut as just assuming that an
appreciation of a currency makes a multinational richer.
 Many have large hedges on currencies in order to take away
the volatility on foreign exchanges. Emerging market profits are
also often ploughed directly back into the countries from whence
they derive.
 Investors are also divided over whether it is still a good
play to buy export-oriented developed market stocks to get proxy
emerging market exposure or to go for the real thing.
 Ashburton's Hanson, for example, suggested that volatility
in emerging markets might prompt more investor interest in
proxies. But Credit Suisse veteran investment analyst Bob Parker
of Credit Suisse told a conference this week that such proxies
were now looking expensive.
 There is little doubt that even with currency tensions and
potentially major foreign exchange moves emerging markets will
remain attractive to global investors and that proxies will be a
part of it. But they may have to be more selective.
 ""Given that we seem to be moving through a volatile period,
one would want to make sure (a) company is managing its risks,""
said Neil Dwane, chief European investment officer of fund
managers RCM. ""It is going to be quite complicated.""

 * Says this also true for dollar and yuan
 * G20 must stop currency dispute escalating
 
 (Adds details, further quotes)
 By Gernot Heller
 BERLIN, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Foreign exchange rates, including
the dollar and yuan, must reflect economic fundamentals, German
Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle told Reuters on Thursday ahead
of a meeting of G20 finance and central bank chiefs.
 ""Exchange rates must reflect economic fundamentals. That
goes for all currencies, including the U.S. dollar and yuan,"" he
said in an interview ahead of the meeting on Friday and Saturday
in South Korea.
 ""We need flexible exchange rates and free capital movement
as we head towards a stable global economy and seek to dismantle
global imbalances,"" Bruederle said.
 The meeting of Group of 20 finance ministers comes at a time
of renewed fears of a trade war which could see countries
devaluing their currencies to boost exports. 
 There is speculation that a full summit of the group's
leaders in Seoul next month could come up with a grand bargain
to deal with the currency issues and rebalance the global
economy next month.
 ""A currency dispute can quickly turn into a trade war. All
G20 states together bear the responsibility of preventing an
escalation,"" he said.
 The United States, which has taken a hard line on the issue,
said on Wednesday it wanted the G20 ministers to commit to
allowing market forces to set currency values. U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner said major world currencies were
""roughly in alignment"".
 Policymakers hope that by persuading major emerging and
advanced economies to cooperate on foreign exchange policies,
they can coax China into allowing the value of its currency to
rise.
 Brazil imposed tax measures this week to try to push down
the value of its currency, while Japan intervened in foreign
exchange markets last month to curb gains in the yen.
 Bruederle also advised against overloading the International
Monetary Fund with tasks, saying it would not be a good idea to
put a global central bank or insurance agency under the auspices
of the Washington-based global lender.
 The minister said he believed China, Japan and India were
showing strong interest in progress in the long-stalled Doha
talks on global trade.

(Adds comment from German finance ministry)
 By Emma Thomasson
 ZURICH, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Switzerland and Germany have
agreed the outlines of a deal for a withholding tax on billions
of euros held in secret Swiss accounts and want to finalise
details this month, a top official was quoted as saying.
 Michael Ambuehl, the top Swiss negotiator for international
financial affairs, told Thursday's Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger he
hoped a deal could be signed by the end of the month.
 ""There are no concrete figures yet, but we have agreed with
Germany on principles and formulas which have to be fleshed out
in negotiations,"" he said.
 Both Berlin and Berne rejected a weekend report that they
had agreed on details of a withholding tax on hidden German
assets -- estimated at 200 billion euros ($278.5 billion) --
that would yield 30 billion euros for Berlin's stretched public
coffers.
 Germany's finance ministry said a deal was in the works and
that talks should conclude this autumn.
 ""They are in the final phases and are progressing well but I
cannot say anything about their content because both parties
have agreed to maintain silence,"" a ministry spokesman said,
declining to be named.
 Ambuehl, who also negotiated a deal last year to end a
bruising U.S. tax investigation into top Swiss bank UBS
, said Switzerland had persuaded Germany of the merits
of a withholding tax but gave no further details.
 Some media reports have suggested a withholding tax as high
as 35 percent could be imposed although Swiss officials expect
the tax to be set at the same level as the 25 percent Germany
has for capital gains and profit from share sales.
 A withholding tax means the Swiss will not automatically
share account information with Germany, preserving the bank
privacy that has been crucial to building up Switzerland's $2
trillion offshore wealth management industry.
 Ambuel said the deal aimed to solved the problem of existing
untaxed assets as well as how new deposits would be taxed, more
access for Swiss banks to the German market and the vexed issue
of Germany's purchase of Swiss account data from informants.

tax cheats and raided the German offices of Switzerland's No.2

 Credit Suisse Chief Executive Brady Dougan, whose bank
reported results on Thursday, said resolving tax matters would
ultimately be good for the bank's business and for Switzerland.
 ""Over time, getting clarity around these issues will be
positive,"" he told Reuters Insider TV.
 
 For a Reuters Insider TV interview with CEO Brady Dougan

 Switzerland's long tradition of banking secrecy has come
under fire in recent years, particularly from its neighbours
Germany, Italy and France, whose citizens have dodged the tax
man by hiding cash in secret accounts across the border.
 UBS was forced to pay a fine and hand over names of wealthy
American clients suspected of dodging taxes last year to settle
a U.S. investigation that threatened the top Swiss bank.
 Swiss Finance Minister Hans-Rudolf Merz had wanted to seal a
deal before he leaves office at the end of October, but his
German counterpart Wolfgang Schaeuble has been unwell recently,
raising questions over this time frame.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The dollar trimmed gains against
the euro on Thursday as investors reckoned comments from U.S.
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner may not have warranted a
brief jump in the U.S. currency earlier in the day.
 The dollar approached a 15-year low against the yen in early
European trade while the euro neared the day's high. The U.S.
currency remains on the back foot on speculation the Federal
Reserve may implement more quantitative easing next month, which
would be negative for the dollar.
 The Wall Street Journal quoted Geithner as saying major
currencies were roughly in alignment and that he would use a
weekend meeting of G20 finance ministers to advance efforts to
rebalance the world economy and move toward norms on currency
policy.
 He divided currencies into three categories. The first,
including China's yuan, were undervalued by any measure, while
the second group were those of emerging economies with flexible
exchange rates that intervene or impose taxes.
 The third comprised major currencies ""which are roughly in
alignment now"", a comment the WSJ said suggested he saw no
reason for the dollar to fall further against the euro and yen.
 Investors initially took that as a cue to buy the dollar,
but analysts argued Geithner's comments did not mark a
significant change in U.S. forex policy, adding that this
explained the pullback in the U.S. currency's gains.
""What Geithner said was not targeted at the U.S. dollar. He
was making his position clear before the G20 that the U.S. would
not fight everybody on FX, just China,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann,
currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 By 0746 GMT, the euro was flat on the day at $1.3970,
recovering from a slide to $1.3874 in earlier trade, according
to Reuters data. Traders said Asian demand was helping to boost
the single European currency in early European trade.
 The dollar index was little changed at 77.197. It hit a
10-month low of 76.144 last week.
 The dollar fell as low as 80.93 yen according to Reuters
data, pulling back from the day's high of 81.82 yen and closing
in on 80.84 yen hit on Wednesday, its weakest since mid-1995.
 The market is wary that Japanese authorities could intervene
to slow the yen's rise again, after they did so on Sept. 15,
selling yen for the first time in more than six years.
 
 G20 IN FOCUS
 Analysts said speculators cut hefty short positions in the
dollar on the article while longer-term investors were hesitant
to take big positions in either direction ahead of the G20 meet
and the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next month.
 Speculation of a grand bargain by the G20 to rebalance the
global economy is swirling, with G20 finance and central bank
chiefs meeting on Friday in South Korea to discuss a a common
path on managing currency, trade and economic imbalances. G20
leaders will meet in Seoul next month.
 Taisuke Tanaka, FX strategist at Nomura Securities in Tokyo,
said Geithner's comments, along with his other recent remarks
stressing the U.S. was not pursuing a deliberate policy of
devaluing the dollar, were probably intended to help
Washington's negotiating position at the G20.
 ""If they urge China to revalue the yuan, they might be told
that the dollar's weakness is the problem,"" Tanaka said.
 ""Since it is clear that the direction is toward an expansion
of quantitative easing (in the United States), it is hard to
expect a sustained rebound in the dollar,"" he said.

 * Service sector grows at slower pace this month
 * Manufacturing sector growth accelerates
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The euro zone's economic recovery
lost momentum this month as a surprise upswing in Germany was
offset by slowing growth in France, and manufacturers countered
a poorer performance in the service sector, surveys showed.
 Markit's Eurozone Flash Services Purchasing Managers' Index,
made up of surveys of around 2,000 businesses ranging from banks
to restaurants, fell to 53.2 in October from September's 54.1,
its lowest reading since February.
 The index has now been above the 50.0 mark that divides
growth in business activity from contraction since August 2009
but was shy of the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for
53.7.
""The recovery is becoming ever more dependent on the
manufacturing sector and Germany in particular. The periphery is
really struggling and increasingly so as we moved into the
fourth quarter,"" said Chris Williamson at Markit.
 The manufacturing sector, which drove a large part of the
economic recovery last year, saw activity pick up faster than
expected this month, driven by a buoyant Germany and strong new
orders.
 The flash manufacturing index rose to 54.1 in October from
53.7 in September, confounding forecasts for a fall to 53.2,
while the output index slipped to 53.8 this month, from 54.0 in
September.
 France's service sector grew much more sluggishly than last
month and at its slowest pace since March while its
manufacturing sector saw growth tail off slightly more than
expected.
 But data from neighbouring Germany, Europe's biggest
economy, showed the pace of growth accelerated with both its
service and manufacturing sectors expanding much faster than
expected.
 Figures on Tuesday showed Germany's ZEW sentiment index, a
key gauge of German analyst and investor sentiment, fell less
than expected in October, bolstering hopes that any slowdown in
Europe's powerhouse economy will be milder than forecast.
 The euro zone manufacturing sector's new orders index rose
to 54.3 this month from 53.2 in September, despite the euro
hitting 8-month highs against the dollar last week, with
companies reporting increased sales to China, Eastern Europe,
the U.S. and from within the euro zone.
 
 GROWTH GEARS DOWN
 The composite index, made up from the services and
manufacturing sectors and often used to predict overall growth,
dropped to 53.4 this month from 54.1 in September, missing
expectations for 53.6.
 ""If it holds at this level for the rest of the quarter you
are looking at a 0.3 percent rise in GDP so that is down from
what we estimate was a 0.6 percent rise in the third quarter,""
Williamson said.
 The euro zone escaped from its deepest recession in post-war
history in the third quarter of last year, having pumped
billions of euros into recovery measures, and relatively strong
second-quarter growth of 1.0 percent surprised markets.
Economists in a Reuters poll say growth has since slowed and
expect the economy to expand between 0.2 and 0.4 percent per
quarter through to the end of next year.
 The service sector's backlogs of work index slumped to 49.6
this month -- its first time below 50 since January -- from
September's 51.6, signalling firms were not operating at full
capacity.
 Companies hired fewer new workers this month, with the
composite employment index falling to 51.0 from 51.4 in
September. The manufacturing sector took on staff at the fastest
pace since March 2008 but job creation slowed to show almost no
growth in services.
 Data released earlier this month showed unemployment was at
10.1 percent in August, having hovered around 10 percent for
five months.

the Group of 20 leading economies to impose caps on individual
countries' current account balances as a solution to tensions
over currency policies, a finance ministry source said on
Thursday.
 The G20 finance ministers and central bankers meet in South
Korea on Friday and Saturday to try and reach an agreement on how
to deal with trade and growth imbalances ahead of a meeting of
their leaders in November.
 One proposal is for G20 members to commit themselves to a cap
on current account balances, which officials reckon would be a
palatable solution to strains caused by massive investment flows
away from low-growth, low-return rich nations to faster growing
emerging economies.
 ""I do believe that this has to be looked at more
fundamentally and by artificially linking the current account
deficits levels to the GDP, you are merely skimming the surface,""
the official, with direct knowledge of G20 deliberations, said.
 ""I am not sure that this will be supported by very many
emerging economies"", the official said.
 Pushing through any agreement is not going to be easy in a
group whose current account balances range from a 5 percent
deficit in the case of Turkey to Saudi Arabia's 7 percent
surplus.
 India, Asia's third largest economy, is expected to grow at
8.5 percent for the current fiscal that ends in March 2011. Its
current account deficit, nearly 3 percent of GDP at a record
$13.7 billion in June and the worst in three decades, is a sign
of rampant demand in that vibrant economy.
 It also makes India more welcoming to funds that rich nations
have pumped into their struggling economies and which now are
being diverted into emerging markets in search of higher returns.
 ""We believe that trade flows should not be restricted.."", the
Indian official said.
 India however believes the G20 is the right forum for
discussions on currencies and the impact of quantitative easing
policies in the developed economies.
 ""Ours is also more of a domestic growth story but with QE
battles likely to be played out in developed economies, it
complicates monetary policymaking for us at a time when inflation
is still high.
 ""So we are open to any discussion or solution to this vexed
issue and believe this is the right platform for that.""

 By Hideyuki Sano and Yoko Matsudaira
 TOKYO, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Japan's Sumitomo Life Insurance
plans to maintain 100 percent hedging on its foreign bond
investments and to increase its yen bond investment in the
October-March period, an official at the firm said, as U.S.
dollar weakness drives uncertainty on the global economic

 Japan's fourth-largest insurer expects the country's economy
to muddle through its current soft patch and sees the 10-year
Japanese government bond yield climbing back to around 1.1
percent by the end of March, the investment manager told Reuters
in an interview.
 The company, with total assets of 23 trillion yen ($282
billion), as much as some major sovereign wealth funds, has fully
hedged against its investments in foreign-denominated assets,
unlike the remainder of Japan's top four life insurers, which
only partially hedge such holdings.
 ""If we could see the yen weakening steadily, we could think
about reducing hedging. But right now we can't really be sure
there is no risk of the dollar continuing to fall,"" Haruhisa
Hirata, deputy general manager of investment strategy at the
insurer told Reuters.
 The interview was conducted on Monday under embargo until
Thursday.
 Hirata said the company slightly increased its hedged foreign
debt investment in the six months to September from 1.8 trillion
yen in March.
 About half of its foreign-denominated bond investments are in
the euro, while about a third are in the dollar, with the
remainder in other currencies such as the Australian dollar.
 The company does not plan to radically change this
composition, Hirata said. But he added that this would depend on
the outlook for currency yield curves.
 As the cost of currency hedging is determined by short-term
interest rates, the recent rise in euro zone interest rates is
making euro zone bonds less attractive than before.
 Even more so at the moment as the 10-year German bond yield
is less than the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries notes.
 ""The attraction of euro is diminishing a little bit compared
to the past,"" Hirata said.
 ASSET MATCH
 The company plans to increase its yen bond holdings in the
six months to March, with an emphasis on trying to match its
assets with its long-term yen liabilities.
 ""At the moment, the duration of our liabilities is still
longer than the duration of our assets. That generally works to
make us extend durations,"" continued Hirata.
 But he also said the company thinks the 10-year Japanese
government bond yield, which is at around 0.9 percent, is likely
to move between 0.8 to 1.4 percent in October-March.
 ""The 10-year JGB yield fell below 1 percent in 1998 and 2003.
But each time it didn't stay there for that long. The market
seems to be so pessimistic about the economy at the moment but we
don't think current yield levels are sustainable.""
 ""Most of our extra cash will be invested in domestic bonds.
But as we already made a raft of investments in yen bonds in the
first half of the financial year, we don't want to buy them at
expensive levels. We may not buy yen bonds in an amount that
would have a market impact.""
 Sumitomo has added to its domestic bond holding by hundreds
of billions of yen, he said. As of March, it had 10.6 trillion
yen of yen bonds, including 4.9 trillion yen of JGBs.
 The company, which has been cautious about stocks, does not
plan to drastically change its holding of Japanese shares, Hirata
added.
 In March, the company held 1.3 trillion yen of Japanese
shares, or about 5.7 percent of its total assets -- by far the
lowest ratio among Japan's top four life insurers.
 Sumitomo expects Nikkei share average to trade between 8,500
and 11,000 in the six months to March, Hirata said.
 ""I don't think we need to be too pessimistic about Japanese
shares.""
 But he added that the firm wants to keep its share holdings
in check to avoid stock market volatility hurting its financial
health.

 * U.S. wants G20 to agree ""norms"" on exchange rate policy
 * Clutch of countries reject targets for current accounts
 * Geithner sees major currencies ""roughly in alignment""
 
 By Abhijit Neogy and Toni Vorobyova
 GYEONGJU, South Korea, Oct 21 (Reuters) - G20 officials are
unlikely to reach an accord rejecting currency devaluations and
capping current account balances, an informed source said on
Thursday, after U.S. proposals ran into stiff opposition.
 The swift rebuff of a U.S. call for numerical targets for
""sustainable"" trade surpluses and deficits underscored the
difficulties facing Group of 20 finance ministers gathering in
South Korea as they try to defuse tensions over currencies and
economic imbalances.
 The G20 source, who has direct knowledge of deliberations at
the meeting, said the proposals had not found favour with India,
China and other emerging economies, or even the likes of
Germany, which has a large current account surplus.
 In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner called for an agreement on exchange
rate policy ""norms"".
 ""Right now, there is no established sense of what's fair,""
he told the paper. ""We would like countries to move toward a set
of norms on exchange rate policy.""
 Washington is also floating the idea of specific targets for
current account balances. This would build on a G20 pledge a
year ago to tilt growth away from exports in fast-growing
surplus countries, such as China, and to boost savings in rich
deficit economies, including the United States.
 ""We are exploring whether we can agree to commit to keep the
external imbalances to levels that are more sustainable,""
Geithner said.
 The G20 source said the drafting of a communique would only
begin late on Friday after a first round of meetings between
finance ministers and central bank governors in Gyeongju.
 ""If the U.S. persists with that line, we will oppose it,"" he
said, adding that the final communique would make a rather
""subdued"" reference to currencies and current account balances.
 French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said coordination
on currency policy was lacking and that Asia had a vital role to
play. ""We can see there are imbalances, that coordination is at
times lacking on policy,"" she said in Paris.
 
 ""LET'S ALL LIVE IN PEACE""
 Diplomats said Washington was proposing that countries
should aim to limit their surplus or deficit on the current
account -- the broadest measure of trade in goods and services
-- to 4 percent of gross domestic product.
 But German Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle said he was
opposed to numerical goals.
 ""Macroeconomic fine-tuning and quantitative targets are not
the right approach in our view,"" Bruederle told Reuters in
Berlin before leaving for the G20 talks.
 Russian deputy finance minister Dimitry Pankin was also
sceptical about the U.S. initiative.
 ""The United States will try to put the question of exchange
rates and current account balances at the top of the agenda, to
try to press China to make some commitments on this issue. In my
view it is unlikely that they will succeed,"" Pankin said.
 ""Most likely, there will be some general words, along the
lines of 'let's all live in peace'. I do not expect much success
in this sphere,"" he told reporters.
 An Indian finance ministry official gave equally short
shrift to Geithner's idea of numerical goals.
 ""I do believe that this has to be looked at more
fundamentally. By artificially linking current account deficit
levels to the GDP you are merely skimming the surface. I am not
sure that this will be supported by very many emerging
economies,"" the official told Reuters.
 
 BLAME GAME
 Pankin criticised Washington for piling pressure on emerging
markets to lead a rebalancing when it was loose U.S. policy
settings that were sending capital pouring into developing
economies, generating pressure for their exchange rates to rise.
 ""We think that such policies will not come to any good,"" he
said. Things would not turn out well unless the United States
cut its budget deficit and tightened monetary policy, he added.
 His forthright remarks contrasted with the emollient note on
exchange rates struck by Geithner, who hopes that, by preaching
currency cooperation, he can coax China into allowing the value
of the yuan to rise more quickly.
 Major currencies were ""roughly in alignment now"", Geithner
told the Wall Street Journal.
 The Treasury chief repeated his view that the yuan, also
known as the renminbi, was significantly undervalued. But he
said that would be corrected over time if the brisker pace of
appreciation witnessed since September were sustained.
 ""If China knew that if it moved more rapidly, other emerging
markets would move with them, it would be easier for them to
move,"" Geithner said.
 Countries from Brazil to G20 host South Korea are loath to
allow their exchange rates to rise for fear of losing
competitiveness to China. For its part, Beijing is adamant that
the yuan's rate of climb must be gradual.
 ""If the renminbi exchange rate is not stable, companies will
not be stable, employment will not be stable and society will
not be stable,"" the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling
Communist Party, said in an editorial on Thursday.
 The task for finance ministers and central bank governors,
at a two-day meeting starting on Friday, is to paper over such
tensions so they do not mar a G20 summit next month in Seoul.

1506,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2010 02:12AM ET</span>",Nippon Life to increase yen fixed-rate assets in H2," * To boost investment in H2 by 400 billion yen
 * Most of increase to be in yen fixed-rate assets
 * May also raise hedged, unhedged foreign bond holdings
 By Shinichi Saoshiro and Takeshi Yoshiike
 TOKYO, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Japan's Nippon Life Insurance Co
said it plans to place most of its new investment for the second
half of the fiscal year until March 2011 in yen fixed-rate assets
due to the slow pace of economic recovery.
 The country's largest life insurer by assets managed a total
of 47.1 trillion yen ($580 billion) -- roughly the size of
Indonesia's economy -- on behalf of its policy holders at the end
of September 2010. Around 72 percent of that was in yen
fixed-rate assets.
 The company plans to increase its assets by 400 billion yen
in the second half, centred on yen fixed-rate assets that include
Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and hedged foreign debt.
 ""Economic recovery across countries remains subdued and we
will keep yen fixed-rate assets, which offer stable returns, as
our core investments,"" Yosuke Matsunaga, general manager of the
firm's finance and investment planning department, told reporters
on Wednesday.
 It classifies currency hedged foreign bonds as yen fixed-rate
assets as they are protected from foreign exchange rate
fluctuations.
 The insurer said much of the increase in yen fixed-rate
assets will be in superlong JGBs and corporate bonds. It said it
could increase its hedged foreign bond holdings depending on
exchange rates.
 The firm said it boosted its hedged foreign bond holdings by
900 billion yen to 5 trillion yen in the first half through to
September.
 It said it would also either keep its unhedged foreign bond
holdings steady in the second half or increase them if conditions
were favourable.
 ""We may buy more unhedged foreign bonds in the second half if
foreign exchange levels make these assets relatively cheap,""
Matsunaga said in comments that were embargoed until Thursday.
 TAKING ADVANTAGE
 Taking advantage of the yen's appreciation, the insurer
lifted its unhedged foreign bond holdings by 380 billion yen to
2.59 trillion yen in the first half.
 Nippon Life expects the dollar to move between 75 yen and 95
yen and the euro between 100 yen and 120 yen through March 2011.
 On Thursday the dollar was at 81.12 yen after hitting a
15-year low of 80.84 yen this week. The euro stood at 112.95 yen
after marking a nine-year low below 106 yen in August.
 The insurer said it expects the benchmark 10-year JGB yield
to range between 0.7 percent and 1.2 percent through March 2011.
 The 10-year JGB yielded 0.880 percent after hitting a
seven-year trough of 0.820 percent earlier this month.
 Nippon Life sees Japan's Nikkei stock average, which closed
at 9,376 on Thursday, moving between 9,000 and 13,000 in the
second half.
 ""We have to take a cautious stance towards equities given
uncertain prospects towards the economy. We plan to keep our
foreign and domestic stock holdings unchanged for the second
half,"" Matsunaga said.
 As of the end of September, Nippon Life held 5.9 trillion yen
in domestic stocks and 860 billion yen in foreign stocks.

 * But short-covering fades as dollar sellers appear
 * Market watching G20 finmins meeting for FX discussion
 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Thursday on
short-covering after comments by Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner
that major currencies were roughly in alignment, but tempered its
gains ahead of a G20 meeting likely to debate currency policies.
 The greenback has been under heavy selling pressure for
weeks, pushed down by expectations of further quantitative easing
by the Federal Reserve to boost a sluggish U.S. recovery, and the
market has generally become short dollars in anticipation.
 It held mild gains against the euro and a basket of
currencies but struggled against the yen, holding close to a
15-year low of 80.84 yen set on Wednesday.
 Speculation of a grand bargain by the Group of 20 to
rebalance the global economy is swirling, with G20 finance and
central bank chiefs meeting on Friday in South Korea to discuss a
a common path on managing currency, trade and economic imbalances
ahead of a leadership meeting in Seoul next month.
 Analysts said the market would watch closely for signs on how
discussions were going.
 ""If we hear divergent comments, that will be more worrying,""
said Robert Ryan, FX strategist at BNP Paribas in Singapore.
 Washington is pressing Beijing to let the yuan appreciate
faster, and talk of competitive currency depreciation has flared
as developed countries keep monetary policy easy to shore up
sluggish growth but capital flows in search of better yields push
up currencies in faster growing emerging economies.
 The Wall Street Journal quoted Geithner as saying he would
use the weekend meeting to advance efforts to rebalance the world
economy and move toward norms on exchange rate policy.
 He divided currencies into three categories, with the first,
including China's yuan, undervalued by any measure, while the
second were of emerging economies with flexible exchange rates
that intervene or impose taxes.
 The third was the major currencies, ""which are roughly in
alignment now"", a comment the WSJ said suggested he saw no reason
for the dollar to fall further against the euro and yen.
 The euro, which fell as far as $1.3872, later recovered to
$1.3900 as the market examined the comments more closely, but was
still down 0.4 percent on the day.
 The dollar index rose 0.4 percent to 77.459, holding off a
10-month low of 76.144 marked last week.
 Taisuke Tanaka, FX strategist at Nomura Securities, said
these and other recent remarks by Geithner stressing the U.S. was
not pursuing a deliberate policy of devaluing the dollar were
likely intended to help Washington's negotiating position at the
G20.
 ""If they urge China to revalue the yuan, they might be told
that the dollar's weakness is the problem,"" Tanaka said.
 ""Since it is clear that the direction is toward an expansion
of quantitative easing (in the United States), it is hard to
expect a sustained rebound in the dollar,"" he said.
 The dollar rose as far as 81.84 yen but quickly retreated to
81.20 yen, up just 0.1 percent on the day. Early on in the
session it had dipped to 80.98 yen, not far off its latest
15-year low and nearing a record low at 79.75 yen set in 1995.
 Its brief run higher met with selling from Japanese exporters
and Asian and European banks, traders said, with some noting its
tight trading range in recent weeks had put off short-term
speculators, who preferred more active pairs such as euro/dollar
or Aussie/yen.
 Traders reported talk of stop loss sell orders at 80.80 yen
and 80.50 yen but also of an institutional Japanese investor's
bids below 81 yen.
 The market is wary that Japanese authorities could intervene
to slow the yen's rise again, after they did so on Sept. 15,
selling yen for the first time in more than six years.

 * For more stories on the G20 meeting, see [ID:nTOE69K01G]
(Adds more quote, background)
 SEOUL, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Developed countries need to take
action over increased global liquidity that has created a boom
in emerging market assets, Turkey's central bank governor
Durmus Yilmaz said on Thursday.
 ""It is a burden and responsibility of the advanced
countries to take measures on extra liquidity they create to
increase economic activity in their own countries,"" Yilmaz told
reporters in Seoul on the sidelines of a seminar ahead of a G20
finance officials' meeting in South Korea.
 Yilmaz said how to ensure that extra liquidity fed through
into the economies of developed economies and measures to
tackle the financial flows that have poured into emerging
markets would be at the core of talks at the G20 meeting later
this week.
 Currency tensions are expected to take centre stage at the
meetings, as a decline in the dollar and China's tightly
controlled foreign exchange regime have put upward pressure on
other emerging market currencies that are allowed to move more
freely.
 Many policymakers fear sharp currency appreciation will
make their countries' exports less competitive, stifling their
economic recoveries.
 Yilmaz said that at present it was too difficult to judge
what the result of the discussions would be.
 The remarks came as record-low interest rates and anaemic
growth in the developed world prompt global investors to pour
more money into higher-yielding emerging markets, driving up
local currencies and asset markets. The Turkish lira  is
trading around a two-year high against the dollar.
 ""At the moment, we hear lots of complaints (from) Turkish
exporters,"" Yilmaz said.
 The central bank will continue to take measures to enhance
the resilience of the economy against financial risks that
Turkey may be exposed to in the medium term, Yilmaz said in a
prepared statement.
 He said the country's policy rates would be maintained at
current levels for ""some time"", adding the economy shows no
signs of overheating as inflation expectations remain stable.
 ""Economic activity has been recovering gradually -- no
signs of overheating. Headwinds from food prices are likely to
be transitory, core inflation remains subdued, inflation
expectations are stable.""
 Earlier this month, the central bank cut its overnight
borrowing rate by a surprisingly large 50 basis points to
encourage interbank lending but left its policy rate unchanged

1509,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2010 12:44AM ET</span>","SCENARIOS-How the world can tackle skewed growth, FX"," SEOUL, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Finance leaders are trying to
reconcile their differences over deep imbalances in the global
economy and reduce the risk of a currency war.
 Talks at the meeting of Group of 20 finance ministers and
central bankers this week in South Korea and of their leaders in
November should reveal the struggle among these diverse economies
to find common ground on policies and currencies.
 Below are possible ways forward for addressing uneven global
growth and currency tensions, evident in China's export might and
its yuan currency, and the declining dollar in face of slow
growth and high debts of many rich economies.
 GIVE IMF AN ENHANCED ROLE AND REFORM IT
 PROBABILITY: High.
 This is the route that countries agreed to try at their
meetings in Washington earlier in October. A lot of work remains
on details and to make any agreement work.
 The International Monetary Fund's 187-member countries have
agreed that urgent action is needed to give the IMF a more
assertive role in highlighting the economic policies of countries
that could cause currency problems, and that toughened scrutiny
of rich countries is a priority.
 Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the IMF's managing director, has
proposed drawing up ""spill-over reports"" on how the economic
policies of the world's five largest economies -- the United
States, China, the euro zone, Japan and the United Kingdom --
affect each other.
The reports would build on existing IMF powers, known as
Article IV annual reviews, where the IMF examines the economic
policies of all its 187 members and makes recommendations. But
the IMF has struggled to get governments to heed its calls for
tough reforms.
 If toughened review powers can be twinned with a giving a
bigger voice to developing countries at the IMF, which
traditionally is dominated by the West, the proposal may gain
momentum. With debate over currencies and current account
balances heating up, it is likely any say on IMF reform will be
left to the G20 leaders at next month's summit in South Korea.
For details, please see
 Similar approaches to build on the Article IV reviews have
failed twice in the past. China balks at calls for reform of its
currency system. In the past it has even blocked publication of
its IMF review. European countries have also ignored Fund
suggestions that they undertake politically sensitive reforms,
such as to their labor markets.
 Hence there is some skepticism why this time should be
different.
 USE THE G20 TO THRASH OUT CURRENCY DIFFERENCES
 PROBABILITY: France will try it next year, big challenge.
 The Group of 20, representing the leading developed and
emerging economies, last year became the main forum for
discussing the global economy, overtaking the G7.
 G20 finance ministers and central bank governors meet in
South Korea on Oct. 22-23 before a leaders summit in Seoul on
Nov. 11-12. The G20 traditionally issues a communique which could
lay out a common stance on how to redress global imbalances and
relieve pressure on currencies.
 Countries have indicated that currencies will be a major
theme at the meetings. One proposal is a limit on current account
balances, although it also seems certain officials will baulk at
any one-size-fits-all norm.
 Privately, officials from some rich countries grumble that
the G20 is too unwieldy for detailed debate of complex issues and
informal discussions with some of the G20's biggest members are
more fruitful.
 But France, which assumes the G20 presidency in 2011, has
said there is no obvious alternative to the G20 for discussing
currencies. French President Nicolas Sarkozy wants to make review
of the international monetary regime a centerpiece of his G20
presidency next year.
 Brazil has suggested the G20 should work on a ""new Plaza
Accord"" -- the landmark 1985 pact under which five countries
(United States, Japan, Britain, West Germany and France)
engineered a dollar depreciation via currency market
interventions and economic reforms. U.S, officials too seem to
favour some norms on FX policy. But few expect such explicit
prescriptions in a more complex world.
G7 PLUS CHINA THRASH OUT THEIR DIFFERENCES
 PROBABILITY: Unlikely
The economic powers of the 20th Century that make up the Group
of Seven -- the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France,
Italy and Canada -- could invite China to join them to work out
their differences.
 The currencies of the G7 -- U.S. dollar, yen, euro and
Canadian dollar -- account for the bulk of the $3 trillion in
daily trading volumes in global foreign exchange markets.
Including China in talks with the G7 financial leaders on
currencies would be essential because it is the world's biggest
exporter and has amassed $2.45 trillion in foreign exchange
reserves while keep the value of the yuan down.
 The head of the euro zone finance ministers, Jean-Claude
Juncker, told Reuters on Friday that the G7 plus China would be
the ""ideal forum"" for discussing currencies.
 But the G7 is a waning forum and no longer issues formal
communiques and China would probably refuse to join a group whose
other members are all likely to put it under pressure to revalue
the yuan.
 A G7-plus-China format would also probably be resented by
other emerging economic heavyweights such as Brazil, Russia and
India. An alternative would be G7 plus the BRICs but there has
been little serious discussion of such a grouping recently.
DO NOTHING
 PROBABILITY: Likely
 One possibility is that countries cannot agree on how to
coordinate and instead pursue national policies, reversing the
remarkable unity seen after the credit crisis exploded.
 The backlash over the budget deficits is leading to fiscal
retrenchment and retreat to national solutions, particularly in
Europe. The risk is that taking fiscal policy off the table when
monetary policy is near exhaustion and growth still fragile will
feed uneven growth, heightening currency misalignments and spill
over into currency and trade wars.
 China's central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said on Friday
that currency problems might fade away when the rich economies
finally recover. A hands-off approach would suit China which does
not want to change its yuan policy.
 Developing economies in Latin America and Southeast Asia
would either have to cope with further strengthening of their
currencies, as investors pour money into their high-yielding
bonds, or attempt costly interventions and controls, risking an
outbreak of trade protectionism and policy discord.
 USE A NEW RESERVE CURRENCY
PROBABILITY: Highly unlikely in the short term.
 China and Russia favor moving the global economy away from
reliance on the U.S. dollar as the world's primary reserve
currency. They have floated the idea of using Special Drawing
Rights, a synthetic IMF unit made up of a basket of currencies.
This would make countries less reliant on the value of the
dollar, now used as the primary medium for world trade. In the
meantime, China is striking more bilateral agreements to trade in
the yuan and bypassing the U.S. dollar.
 Shifts in world currencies take years if not decades, as seen
with the decline of sterling before World War II and then the
abandonment of the dollar peg from 1968 to 1972.
 French President Sarkozy wants to examine international
monetary arrangements as part of his G20 presidency next year.

 * Dollar jumps versus yen on day, euro drops
 * But dollar quickly gives up much of its gains
 TOKYO, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The dollar leapt half a yen and
climbed rapidly against the euro on Thursday after U.S. Treasury
Secretary Tim Geithner said major currencies were roughly in
alignment now, although it later gave back some of its gains.
 The dollar rose as far as 81.84 yen from about 81.00 yen
before the comments came out and the euro fell 0.6 percent in a
matter of minutes as the market, taking the comments to imply
that the dollar did not need to fall further against major
currencies, covered dollar short positions.
 ""It's become a bit difficult to test the dollar's downside
for now,"" said Katsunori Kitakura, chief dealer at Chuo Mitsui
Trust Bank.
 ""It seems as if the G7 has formed a united front ahead of the
G20 meeting, as he's saying he's mainly focusing on emerging
economies when it comes to currencies.""
 In an interview in the Wall Street Journal, Geithner divided
currencies into three categories, with the first, including
China's yuan, undervalued by any measure, while the second were
of emerging economies with flexible exchange rates that intervene
or impose taxes.
 The third was the major currencies, ""which are roughly in
alignment now"", he was quoted as saying.
 The dollar later retreated to 81.25 yen, up just 0.2 percent
on the day, as the market examined the comments more closely.
 The Wall Street Journal said the comments suggested that
Geithner saw no need for the dollar to sink more than it already
had against the euro and the yen, but traders pointed out that he
did not say that exactly.
 The euro, which fell as far as $1.3872, recovered to $1.3932,
down 0.2 percent on the day.
 The dollar has fallen to record lows against the Swiss franc,
hit parity with the Australian dollar and dropped to 15-year lows
against the yen in the past month, driven down by the market in
anticipation of more quantitative easing from the Federal Reserve
possibly as soon as November.
 Talk of competitive currency depreciation has flared up ahead
of a G20 finance ministers meeting this week and a G20 summit
next month, as developed countries keep monetary policy extremely
easy to shore up sluggish growth and as capital flows in search
of better yields push up currencies in faster growing emerging
economies.

gains against them are a disadvantage for its exports.
 Yoshihiko Noda also said policy coordination on currencies

 SINGAPORE, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Thursday
after U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said ahead of a
G20 meeting that major currencies were roughly in alignment,
initially offering support to Japanese stocks.
 However, Tokyo shares reversed course by the close as the
dollar's gains eased and Europe picked up the weaker cue to
open lower. Major stock indexes in Britain, Germany and France
fell 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent at the start of trade.

1520,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2010 07:52PM ET</span>",Turkish banks hesitant about Iran dealings-Babacan," * Turkish deputy PM doubts Iran sanctions effective
 * Turkey-Iran economic relations have been improving
 By Arshad Mohammed
 WASHINGTON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Turkish banks have become
somewhat hesitant about dealing with Iran but Turkey has left
decisions on whether to pull back following U.S. and European
sanctions up to them, a Turkish official said on Wednesday.
 Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan said he doubts sanctions
will bring Iran to change its stance on its uranium enrichment
program, which Tehran says is to generate electricity but
Washington suspects is a cover to develop atomic weapons.
 While saying Turkey would comply with U.N. Security Council
resolutions, Babacan said his government had not provided
guidelines to its banking sector on how to grapple with fresh
financial sanctions imposed by the United States and the
European Union.
 ""We don't believe in sanctions. We don't believe that that
will ultimately make the Iranians act as they are expected to
act. So why would we do things which we don't believe? That's
the bottom line,"" Babacan told reporters.
 ""As a country which has lived with (the) Iranians ... side
by side for centuries, it is very difficult to expect them to
move just because they are under pressure,"" he added. ""The more
pressure, the more it may be difficult for them to move.""
 Turkish banks have shown some wariness about dealing with
Iran following U.S. and EU financial sanctions announced this
summer, Babacan said, though he added that it was too early to
say whether they were actually pulling back.
 ""We are observing a hesitation,"" he said. ""Some of them
(are) finding ways to do business, some of them may be pausing
and trying to decide what to do, but there is obviously some
hesitation.""
 A U.S. law enacted this summer imposes sanctions on
international banking institutions involved with Iran's Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps, its nuclear program or what
Washington calls its support for terrorist activity.
 The law, the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Accountability
and Divestment Act, effectively deprives foreign banks of
access to the U.S. financial system if they do business with
targeted Iranian banks or the Revolutionary Guards.
 Stuart Levey, U.S. undersecretary of the Treasury for
terrorism and financial intelligence, visited Turkey on
Wednesday to discuss U.S. and U.N. sanctions with the private
sector. He was due to meet Turkish officials on Thursday.
 It was unclear how much of a hearing he would get from the
Turkish government, particularly on the question of whether it
should encourage Turkish banks to heed the U.S. sanctions.
 ""We don't have any specific guidelines for Turkish
companies,"" Babacan said. ""What we are telling them is that
these are the laws, look at them, but there is not any reason
for paranoia ... it is their own decision.""
 Turkey, a NATO member that looks to join the EU, has
enjoyed growing economic and financial relations with
neighboring Iran, one of its major energy suppliers.
 Trade between the two nations reached $10 billion in 2008
and could triple in five years, Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip
Erdogan told a group of businessmen he met together with Iran's
First Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi last month.
 Much of that trade is legitimate, but if Turkey became a
virtual safe haven for Iranian banking activities, it will be
easier for Tehran to dodge sanctions, according to diplomats.
 Babacan said Turkey still hopes to triple its trade with
Iran in five years, but acknowledged ""the sanctions will make
our job more difficult.""

 SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Noble Corp , the

 By Glenn Somerville and Jan Strupczewski
 WASHINGTON/BRUSSELS, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The world's biggest
economies are slipping back into pre-crisis bad habits, U.S.
and European officials warned on Wednesday, and the G20 should
target trade gaps and exchange rates to balance global growth.
 A draft European Union document, prepared for a Group of 20
finance leaders meeting in Korea on Friday and Saturday, showed
EU concern that global trade and savings imbalances are
widening again after a brief, recession-induced lull.
 ""(This) could pose significant problems to the global
economy and raise the risk of protectionist backlashes,"" the
document, obtained by Reuters, said. For more see

 Long before the financial crisis blew up in 2007,
economists fretted over huge trade gaps, particularly between
export-rich China and the borrow-and-spend United States. Those
concerns have intensified again as the recovery loses vigor.
 The EU paper singled out China, which has amassed $2.6
trillion in reserves as its exports bounced back, as a primary
culprit behind the growing global imbalances.
 Europe and the United States want Beijing to allow its yuan
currency to rise more rapidly to help cap its export growth and
reduce its reserves. Officials in both regions have stepped up
their rhetoric as the G20 meeting approaches.
 Since China dropped its formal peg to the U.S. dollar in
June, the yuan has strengthened modestly against the dollar but
has weakened against the euro.
 Currency exchange rates have become a major source of
friction in recent weeks as the dollar weakens. Because China
keeps the yuan closely aligned with the dollar, other
currencies have borne the brunt of the adjustment. The euro,
yen and many emerging market currencies have strengthened.
 The United States wants G20 countries to commit to letting
their currencies move more freely and to curb trade deficits or
surpluses. [ID:nN20214175]
 A U.S. Treasury official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that when large economies keep their currencies
from rising, ""that compels other countries to do the same,
setting off a dynamic of competitive nonappreciation.""
 That comment was clearly directed at Beijing although the
official did not mention China by name.
 China has argued that U.S. policies are the root of
strained currency relationships. A weak U.S. economy, near-zero
interest rates and expectations the Federal Reserve will soon
launch another round of monetary easing have driven the dollar
down 13 percent against a basket of currencies <.DXY> since
June.
 A combination of slow growth and high government debt in
most advanced economies means the Fed and other central banks
are the main source of economic support for a sluggish
recovery.
 Britain plans to cut 500,000 jobs, raise the retirement age
and slash welfare as part of a cost-cutting drive announced on
Wednesday. In France, protests have raged over pension reform.
 TARGETING TRADE?
 The currency debate has flared on and off for years with
little progress. One way to break the deadlock may be to
consider a target for current accounts -- a broad measure of
trade -- rather than just focusing on exchange rates.
 Asked if China might be more willing to discuss a target
for its current account -- a broad measure of trade -- rather
than exchange rates, the U.S. official first suggested asking
China but then stated the U.S. position.
 ""From our perspective we believe these issues are
fundamentally, inherently linked,"" the official said.
 The idea would be to agree to a pre-set limit on the size a
country's current account surplus or deficit could reach,
expressed in terms of a percentage of national output.
 The problem would be that some countries with high deficits
or surpluses might be unwilling or unable to quickly reduce
them to an agreed level.
 The Bank of Canada expressed optimism that G20 nations
would eventually make progress in talks to defuse global
currency tensions and it also had conciliatory words for China.
[ID:nN20214175]
 Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney said it may not look
like G20 officials were making headway on currency concerns but
insisted they were ""getting down into the real policy
decisions.""
 ""I think we just have to be more relentless on this,
constructive in the room, and we will ultimately ... make
progress,"" he said.
 Carney said he understood why Beijing prefers to let the
yuan rise gradually. China fears that an abrupt yuan rise would
put such a burden on exporters that they would be forced to cut
jobs, which could be destabilizing at home and abroad.
 ""But as part of rebalancing the global economy, increased
flexibility of the (yuan) is absolutely essential and we're
working with our partners to ensure -- including China -- that
that is the case.""

* Dollar falls sharply as market focuses on Fed easing
* Aussie rebounds, dollar at 15-year low vs yen
* Uncertainty about Fed policy, global currency talks loom
(Updates prices, adds comment)
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The dollar headed for its
worst day in more than three months on Wednesday, reversing
the previous session's rally after an influential consultancy
said the Federal Reserve plans to buy $500 billion of
Treasuries over six months and leave itself room for more
buying.
 The dollar hit a 15-year low beneath 81 yen and the euro
climbed near $1.40 as markets expect the Fed to start pumping
money into the U.S. economy as soon as November, a policy
known as ""quantitative easing,"" which has driven the dollar
down since September.
 The report from Medley Global Advisors accelerated a
dollar sell-off that began overnight as traders said the
market's reaction to China's interest-rate hike on Tuesday was
overdone. The safe-haven dollar posted its best day in two
months after China's tightening fueled worries about global
growth.
 The Medley report echoed comments made on Tuesday by a Fed
official that $100 billion a month in bond purchases may be
appropriate, giving traders an incentive to push the dollar
lower.
 ""Dollar weakness into the Nov. 3 FOMC meeting is the
clearest trade right now. Investors want to continue on that
path,"" said Amelia Bourdeau, senior currency strategist at UBS
in Stamford, Connecticut.
 The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a
basket of six currencies, fell 1.2 percent to 77.210, on track
for its biggest daily percentage drop since July 1.
 The euro rose 1.6 percent to $1.3951, the biggest daily
increase since July 1. It had earlier risen as high as $1.3991
on trading platform EBS and off a $1.3697 session low. Traders
said $1.40 remains a strong resistance and selling interest was
clustered around $1.4010-20.
 Citigroup currency strategists recommended going long the
euro at $1.3845 with a $1.5145 target, a level last approached
in November 2009.
 The dollar hit a 15-year low at 80.84 yen on EBS and was
last down 0.5 percent at 81.16. Japan spent a bit more than $20
billion last month to weaken the yen, but that failed to keep
the dollar from nearing its record low of 79.95 yen.
 The dollar showed little reaction to the Fed's Beige Book
report, which offered further evidence the economy is stuck in
a weak recovery.
 Dean Popplewell, chief strategist of FX brokerage OANDA in
Toronto, said that with uncertainty persisting over the size
and scope of the Fed stimulus, he expects to see ""further
volatility and probably a weaker dollar"" until the central
bank's meeting next month.
 QE IMPACT PRICED IN?
 Analysts warned, however, that already large speculative
bets against the dollar suggests much of the impact of
additional Fed easing may be priced in.
 But David Gilmore, a partner in FX Analytics in Essex,
Connecticut, said markets can discount QE-2 only up to a
point.
 ""When it is expressly open ended, I can't see how markets
can claim QE2 is fully priced,"" he said in a note. ""Maybe the
firsts iteration for November 03, but beyond? Hence, the
dollar should continue to slide on an open-ended QE2 and a
longer-term low rate commitments.""
 Lingering uncertainty about global currency tensions could
also limit the dollar's losses in the short run. Analysts said
China's move and recent assurances from Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner that the United States was not devaluing the
dollar for export advantage suggest G20 finance officials may
be trying to iron out differences over exchange-rate policy
ahead of their weekend meeting in South Korea.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday she
backed a French proposal to put currency issues on the agenda
of a November meeting of G20 heads of state.
 ""People are buying what floats, and what floats right now
is the euro, the Australian dollar,"" BNP Paribas strategist
Sebastien Galy said in New York. ""But if the G20 strikes some
type of deal on currencies, that could reduce the size of
quantitative easing, and less dollar creation will be positive
for the dollar.""

 By Glenn Somerville and Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The United States wants the
Group of 20 countries to reduce global economic imbalances by
committing to curb trade surpluses or deficits and by letting
currencies rise more freely, a senior U.S. official said on
Wednesday.
 Ahead of weekend meetings of G20 finance ministers in
Gyeongju, South Korea, the Treasury Department official made
clear Washington wants currency values to be a focal point and
sees current account levels as a vital part of the discussion.
 China wasn't mentioned by name but Beijing's practice of
managing the value of its yuan has angered the United States,
which argues the currency's low value is fostering global
currency tensions.
 ""When large economies with undervalued exchange rates act
to keep their currencies from appreciating, that compels other
countries to do the same, setting off a dynamic of competitive
nonappreciation,"" the official said at a news briefing.
 China in turn has argued U.S. policies are the root of
strained currency relationships.
 Expectations of a further loosening in U.S. monetary policy
have driven the dollar down to 10-month lows against a broad
basket of currencies, fueling currency problems elsewhere.
 Investors seeking higher yields have sent sudden flows of
capital into dynamic emerging markets like Brazil, driving
their currencies up and threatening to slow exports.
 HEIGHTENED G20 ROLE SOUGHT
 The United States sees the G20, an organization of both
advanced and key emerging-market countries, as critical in the
search for ways to limit currency instability and let market
forces have more sway in setting foreign exchange rates.
 ""Something that we think will be front and central in our
conversations this weekend and going forward is how the G20 can
play an effective role in helping to undergird cooperation on
these exchange rate issues and these external sustainability
issues which are inherently matters for multilateral
cooperation,"" the U.S. official said.

 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner departs on
Wednesday for the gathering of G20 ministers and central bank
governors where currency tensions will get a thorough airing.
 Underlining the seriousness of the divisions, Bank of
England Governor Mervyn King said on Tuesday that if
policymakers can't agree on how to manage foreign exchange
issues and economic imbalances, they risk sparking a
destructive world-wide trade war.
 The U.S. official said the United States was willing to do
its part by saving more and by strengthening exports to reduce
its trade gap, but other countries that enjoy trade surpluses
had to cooperate in correcting imbalances by allowing their
currencies to rise in value.
 FINDING AN OPENING
 Asked if China might be more willing to discuss a target
for its current account -- a broad measures of trade -- rather
than exchange rates, the U.S. official first suggested asking
China but then stated the U.S. position.
 ""From our perspective we believe these issues are
fundamentally, inherently linked,"" the official said.
 The idea would be to agree to a pre-set limit on the size a
country's current account surplus or deficit should reach,
expressing it in terms of a percentage of national output.
 The problem would be that some countries that have very
high deficits or surpluses might be unwilling or unable to
quickly reduce them to an agreed level.
 The U.S. official's comments implied that Geithner will try
to rally support within the G20 for more unity around the
necessity for letting currencies appreciate, though it remains
unclear whether any specific agreement can be reached.
 ""In terms of what we think would be appropriate and would
be important at this juncture within the G20 is to emerge with
a clear commitment to cooperate to facilitate and not impede
orderly current account adjustments,"" the official said.
 Currencies are central to the meetings on Friday and
Saturday, but finance chiefs also will discuss ongoing efforts
to shift voting power at key lending institutions like the
International Monetary Fund to emerging-market nations to
reflect their economic might.
 The U.S. official said a deal on IMF voting shares was
""within reach,"" likely along the lines agreed at a previous G20
meeting in Pittsburgh for a 5 percent shift from
overrepresented countries to underrepresented countries.

 * Rejects preconditions, calls to reopen what is settled
 
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Oct 20 (Reuters) - India's trade chief added his
voice on Wednesday to comments that the long-stalled Doha talks
to free up world trade are again showing signs of life.
 But Trade Minister Anand Sharma said India would not reopen
what had been agreed, and any deal must help developing
countries by making farm trade fairer -- apparently rejecting
U.S. calls for a shake-up of what is on the table so far.
 Sharma was speaking after a visit to assess the state of the
negotiations in Geneva, where ambassadors at the World Trade
Organization have been brainstorming in small groups in recent
weeks to seek new areas of agreement in the deadlocked talks.
 ""We are very happy that there has been some progress, where
in addition to processes the substance is being discussed,""
Sharma told a news conference.
 He said he could see a shared interest in bringing the talks
to a conclusion to help boost the world economy.
 He said there was now an expectation that leaders of the G20
would provide a clear declaration of political intent at their
summit in Seoul next month about the need to reach a deal.
 The talks were launched in late 2001 to free up global
commerce and help poor countries prosper through trade, but have
been deadlocked for over two years, largely on differences
between the United States and big emerging economies like India,
China and Brazil over the extent they should open up.
 Sharma said the past nine years of talks had achieved a
balance between agriculture and industrial goods.
 That runs counter to calls from Washington for richer
developing countries to do more to open up their markets for
industrial goods in return for the cuts in trade-distorting farm
subsidies that the United States is expected to make.
 In particular, the United States wants the big emerging
economies to promise now to sign up to agreements eliminating
duties in certain sectors such as chemicals in addition to any
general cuts in industrial tariffs they agree to.
 Sharma said these sectoral deals were voluntary and
countries would only decide which ones to sign up to once the
WTO's 153 members had reached an outline deal on the Doha talks.
 However, he hinted New Delhi would be prepared to make
concessions on sectoral deals and other issues once ministers
get into the final negotiations.
 ""In a spirit of accommodation there will be very clear and
specific understandings which will happen when the end-game is
announced,"" he said.

 * Indian generics industry crucial to public health
 GENEVA, Oct 20 (Reuters) - India believes a row with the
European Union over seizures of generic drugs will be settled
without litigation, Trade Minister Anand Sharma said on
Wednesday.
 The comments suggest the two trading giants will not allow
the dispute to undermine their current efforts to conclude a
free-trade agreement.
 Sharma said that senior EU officials had told him that
Brussels accepted the generic drugs had been seized because
customs officers had misinterpreted the rules and that the rules
in question would be amended in any case.
 ""I have every reason to believe that the assurances given at
the highest level will be implemented and once that happens that
issue will be resolved,"" Sharma told a news conference.
 The dispute arose from the seizure by Dutch customs in
December 2008 of a blood pressure drug in transit from India to
Brazil. [ID:nLDE64B1O6]
 India subsequently launched a formal dispute at the World
Trade Organization with the EU, but has so far refrained from
escalating the row by asking the WTO to rule on the case.
 The seizure led health activists to argue that the EU and
other rich countries were attacking generic drug production in
developing countries under the guise of pursuing counterfeits in
order to bolster the intellectual property rights of drugs
companies at the expense of poor people's access to medicine.
 But Sharma said that India's generics industry had made a
huge contribution to public health worldwide and India would not
discuss anything in the negotiations with Brussels for a trade
pact that would jeopardise health or undermine the industry.
 ""It is very clear that the generics ensured availability at
affordable prices of these medicines to poor patients in poor
countries, breaking the suffocating stranglehold of the
multinational companies,"" he said.

 NEW YORK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar weakened on
Wednesday as investors expected the Federal Reserve will soon
offer additional stimulus to the economy, while stocks and
commodities recovered after China's surprise interest rate
hike.
 The dollar fell across the board after talk the U.S.

firm, described the Fed's plans in a report, a source told
Reuters. For details, see [ID:nLDE69J20L].
 The prospect of an increase in dollar supply weakened the
currency's value while it fueled a rally in equity markets.
Such a development also will likely anger emerging economies

she said.
 U.S. stocks rose as investors switched focus to positive
corporate earnings from the Chinese rate hike.
 China's move stoked fears among investors about further
tightening in one of the global economy's main drivers and
coincided with increased tensions over global currency policies
before a meeting of Group of 20 finance ministers this

 NEW YORK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Investors unloaded the dollar
on Wednesday as a report from an influential consultancy said
the Federal Reserve planned to buy $500 billion of Treasury
debt over six months to invigorate a faltering U.S. economy.
 The report accelerated a dollar sell-off that began
overnight. The dollar hit a 15-year low beneath 81 yen and the
euro rose above $1.39, up more than 1 percent, while the
commodity-linked Australian dollar rose nearly 2 percent.
 Markets expect the Fed to start pumping money into the U.S.
economy as soon as November, a policy known as ""quantitative
easing,"" and that has driven the dollar down since September.
 The Medley report confirmed comments made on Tuesday by a
Fed official that $100 billion a month in bond purchases may be
appropriate, providing traders an incentive to push the dollar
lower.
 ""Quantitative easing still hangs over the market, and
that's dollar negative, but there is still uncertainty about
what it will look like,"" said Marc Chandler, global head of
currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.
 The euro rose 1.1 percent to $1.3960, off a $1.3699 session
low. It hit an 8-1/2-month high above $1.41 last week. Traders
said selling interest was clustered around $1.4010-20.
 Chandler said a rise in German bond yields in anticipation
of tighter euro zone policy was also helping the euro,
particularly with investors focused on easier U.S. policy.
 CitiFX strategists recommended going long the euro at
$1.3845 with a $1.5145 target, a level last approached in
November 2009.
 Sterling rose 0.9 percent to $1.5848, shaking off losses
after Bank of England minutes showed a three-way split among
policymakers, with one voting for more monetary easing. The
dollar hit a 15-year low beneath 81 yen and was last down 0.6
percent at 81.08 yen. Japan spent a bit more than $20 billion
last month to weaken the yen, but that failed to keep the
dollar from nearing its record low beneath 80 yen.
 DOLLAR LOSSES MAY BE LIMITED
 Analysts warned, however, that already large speculative
bets against the dollar and lingering uncertainty about global
currency tensions could limit dollar losses in the short run.
 Tuesday's surprise interest rate hike from China, which
sparked fear of slower Chinese and global growth, increased
risk aversion and briefly pushed the safe-haven dollar higher
 Some said China's move and recent assurances from Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner the United States was not devaluing
the dollar for export advantage suggest G20 finance officials
may be trying to iron out differences over exchange rate policy
ahead of their weekend meeting in South Korea.
 Washington wants China to allow more rapid appreciation of
the yuan, while Beijing and others complain that dollar
weakness is stoking inflation by pushing money into their
faster-growing economies.

(Adds quotes, details throughout)
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Chinese exporters are using
Malaysia as an illegal transhipment hub to evade European Union
import duties on steel screws and bolts, prompting possible EU
action against Malaysia, a report obtained by Reuters shows.
 ""The Commission has at its disposal several emails from
various operators in the EU and in China that confirm
transhipment practices via Malaysia,"" the confidential EU
document says.
 Chinese and Malaysian officials in Brussels declined to
comment.
 EU officials may start investigating before the end of the
month, Reuters has learned. If they find evidence that tariff
circumvention is hurting EU producers, they could impose taxes
worth up to 85 percent on screws exported by Malaysia.
 ""I know of no reason why this investigation should not go
ahead,"" a senior EU official told Reuters.
 EU moves to bolster the defenses for its 4 billion euro
($5.51 billion) fasteners market could raise suspicions that the
EU is battling China's weak currency with a barrage of new
import tariffs.
 A move against screw and bolt imports would be the latest in
a string of trade protection measures the EU has brought against
Asian exporters in recent months
Disputes between Beijing and Brussels are on the rise as the
EU's trade deficit with China hovers above 100 billion euros.
 European producers watched for years as fierce competition
from China closed factories sypplying screws and bolts to
sectors from the car industry to DYI shops.
 In 2009, a complaint that Chinese exporters were using
illegal pricing to crush their European competitors -- lodged by
the European Industrial Fasteners Institute -- led the 27-nation
bloc to impose steep import tariffs on the Chinese goods.
 Worth up to 85 percent, the duties had the desired effect. 
 One likely trigger for Brussels' action is that EU fraud
officials have been questioning operators in China and Malaysia
for several months to uncover illegal activities by EU
importers, say people close to the case. 
 Another is Malaysian export data, which shows ballooning
sales of fasteners to the EU.
 In the year that the EU hoisted duties against Chinese
fasteners, Malaysia's exports of the same product nearly tripled
to 32,700 tonnes from 13,700 tonnes in 2008, EU statistics show.
 The boom continued this year, with Malaysia supplying more
than 20,000 tonnes -- more than 10 percent of Europe's demand --
in the first three months of the year. In 2008, Malaysia's
market share in the EU had been less than 1 percent.
 At the same time, China's sales of fasteners to Europe
plummeted by 80 percent, and rose more than five-fold to
Malaysia, according to the internal EU document.

 * Local authority cuts positive for support services
 
 By Golnar Motevalli
 LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - British support services firms
are set to make long-term gains from public spending cuts,
analysts say, as the government enforces dramatic efficiencies
across departments and slashes local authority budgets.
 On Wednesday British finance minister George Osborne
revealed the extent of the toughest spending cuts in a
generation, as the coalition government seeks to reduce the
country's ballooning deficit. [ID:nLDE69J0G8]
 The announcement held few surprises for sector investors,
but the tone of the spending review was broadly in favour of
those companies the government needs in order to create savings.
 ""The rhetoric of the statement was focused on driving
efficiency savings within government departments and ultimately
the beneficiaries of today's statement would be the
outsourcers,"" said Execution Noble analyst David Brockton.
 Firms such as Serco  and Capita  have been
tipped by several analysts to gain from the cuts in the
long-term, as they are well placed to deliver the back- and
front-office efficiencies Whitehall seeks.
 Local authorities, which face a 7.1-percent cut in their
annual budgets, are among the hardest hit by Osborne's axe,
another outcome that is likely to benefit the private sector,
which has already gained from decisions by some councils such as
Suffolk to outsource the bulk of their services.
 ""More power to local authorities is likely to be good for
outsourcers ... if they have to make things more efficient
outsourcing is one way they can do that,"" Henry Carver, analyst
at KBC Peel Hunt said.
 Carver added that Capita, whose shares ticked up 0.2 percent
to 739 pence each, was also likely to gain from the drive to
reduce central government administration costs.
 
 INFRASTRUCTURE BOOST
 Serco, which runs prisons and is bidding to run the first
hospital in Britain to be managed jointly by a private company
and the National Health Service (NHS), lost 0.8 percent off its
shares to 620 pence each, trimming losses made in early trade.
 ""The overall cut wasn't as aggressive as originally thought.
The NHS comment was the interesting one, and seeing productivity
improvement,"" said Panmure Gordon analyst Andy Brown. ""To do
that they would have to involve the private sector in one form
or another"".
 Mouchel, which recently gave a profit warning and is exposed
to local authority spending, was down 0.7 percent but
outperforming the FTSE index of British midcap companies
<.FTMC>, helped by the government's commitment to major projects
such as the widening of the M25 highway around London.
 Shares in Atkins , which recently made large
redundancies to bolster investor confidence in its performance,
and has suffered from a bruised construction market, were down
0.9 percent to 769 pence each.

 By Gernot Heller
 BERLIN, Oct 20 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
said on Wednesday that the euro remained vulnerable and was
being shielded at the moment by the euro zone's safety net.
 ""The weakness of the euro we experienced in the spring ...
has not been overcome yet,"" Merkel told an event held by the BGA
foreign trade association in Berlin. ""The euro is protected at
the moment by rescue mechanisms.""
 Fears about the solvency of some euro zone member states
prompted the European Union to set up a 750 billion euro rescue
fund to support the European single currency earlier this year,
working in tandem with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
 That mechanism is due to expire in mid-2013, and Merkel
reiterated that it could not ""simply be extended.""
 The chancellor said she saw a major risk of protectionism,
including from the influence of foreign exchange rates.
 Merkel said she supported a French initiative to put foreign
exchange on the agenda of the G20 presidency. 
 Commenting on measures put in place to help economies cope
with the economic downturn, she said: ""I think there are good
reasons to be thinking about exit strategies now.""
 Merkel also said the German economy could grow by ""3 percent
or perhaps even a bit more this year.""
 A government source told Reuters earlier on Wednesday that
the government expects gross domestic product (GDP) to increase
by 3.4 percent in 2010, and by 1.8 percent in 2011.
 Merkel also said she expected federal net new borrowing to
total just above 50 billion euros this year. That is slightly
less than previous forecasts.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Investors resumed selling the
dollar against most currencies on Wednesday, shaking off the
prior session's Chinese interest rate hike and rediscovering an
appetite for higher-yielding assets.
 Currencies hit hardest by China's rate hike, which sparked
fear of slower Chinese and global growth, bounced back sharply
on Wednesday. The commodity-linked Australian dollar rose one
percent , while oil and U.S. stock indexes rebounded.
 The rebound in the euro and sterling was more modest,
though, and analysts said large speculative bets against the
dollar along with lingering uncertainty about U.S. monetary
policy and global currency tensions could limit dollar losses.
 Scotia Capital strategist Camilla Sutton said the market is
""in a bit of a gray area"" that should persist at least through
a weekend gathering of the G20 and likely until the Federal
Reserve's November meeting, at which officials are expected to
detail plans to pump more money into a sluggish U.S. economy.
 ""We think the dollar will end the year weaker, but for now,
we're probably going to be in a period of more subdued trading
until we get a firmer idea of where policymakers are headed,""
she said.
 The euro, which hit an 8-1/2-month high above $1.41 last
week, was at $1.3835 , up 0.1 percent from late Tuesday.
Technical strategists said an hourly downtrend was in place,
suggesting one more downside test. Resistance was seen around
$1.3890, with $1.3925 the next obstacle.
 In the UK, minutes from the Bank of England's last monetary
policy committee meeting showed a three-way split, with one
member voting for more monetary easing [ID:nBOE004351]
 Sterling initially touched a session low against the euro
 but was last up 0.2 percent against the dollar at
$1.5737 
 The dollar fell 0.4 percent to 81.25 yen , not far
from a 15-year low around 80.88 yen. Japan spent a bit more
than $20 billion last month to weaken the yen, but the
intervention has failed to keep the dollar from edging toward
a record low beneath 80 yen.
 Some analysts said the market's reaction to China's sudden
interest rate hike on Tuesday was excessive and said certainty
that the Federal Reserve will ease policy further next month
was keeping the dollar under pressure.
 CitiFX strategists recommended going long the euro at
$1.3845 with a $1.5145 target, a level last approached in
November 2009.
 Several Fed officials have indicated that the U.S. central
bank will offer more stimulus, with one saying $100 billion a
month in bond purchases may be appropriate. [ID:nN19258951].
But other policymakers have suggested they would proceed
cautiously.
 Analysts say the market has already fully discounted more
Fed easing, giving the dollar scope to recover.
 Some analysts also said China's rate hike and assurances
from Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner the United States was
not devaluing the dollar for export advantage suggest G20
finance officials may be trying to iron out differences over
exchange rate policy ahead of their weekend meeting in South
Korea.
 Washington wants China to allow more rapid appreciation of
the yuan, while Beijing and others complain that dollar
weakness is stoking inflation by pushing money into their
faster-growing economies.
 Scotia's Sutton said even the Bank of Japan's decision not
to intervene again in currency markets to stem steady yen
strength may be part of an attempt to cut tensions.
 ""We are certainly seeing a lot of olive branches out there,
and it seems it could be tied to attempts to stave off all this
talk of currency wars,"" she said.

1545,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2010 09:36AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Foreign companies stepping away from Iran," Oct 20 (Reuters) - Iran's day-to-day business is affected by
tighter international, U.S. and European Union sanctions imposed
in response to Western fears the country's nuclear activities
are aimed at making a bomb. Tehran says it has no such aim.
 Tighter sanctions have scared away the Islamic Republic's
usual trading partners, particularly in the oil and gas
industry, where the country has been dependant on fuel imports.
 Following are key facts on some firms that have been moving
away from Iran and on others still dealing with the country:
 
 MOVING AWAY FROM IRAN 
 * United Arab Emirates-based oil and gas explorer Dragon
Oil's has not renewed an oil swap agreement with Iran which
expired in July 2010. Under the swap agreement, Dragon used to
ship the crude it produces from its offshore development in
Turkmenistan to Iran's Bandar Neka, a port in the Caspian Sea in
return for oil from southern Iran.
 The company said on Wednesday that it is currently exporting
all of its entitlement barrels of Turkmen crude using the
""Western Route"", which is through Baku, Azerbaijan.
 * France's Total said it has halted all its trade in oil
products with Iran in compliance with a European embargo, after
initially resisting pressure from the United States to stop
doing business with Iran.
 Prior to that in early October the company said it was still
buying Iranian crude.
 * Traders said Royal Dutch Shell was still involved in
Iranian crude purchases while the company said in early October
that it was not illegal to lift oil from Iran. But it was not
renewing contracts to supply Iran Air with fuel, an industry
source said in July.

 * Norway's Statoil said it was providing Tehran with
technical assistance while Italy's ENI said it would exit Iran
only when existing deals expire. 
 * ThyssenKrupp, Germany's biggest steelmaker, said on Sept.
23 it would not enter into new contracts with Iran and would
terminate existing contracts in support of sanctions policies of
Germany, the EU and the U.S.
 * Turkish refiner Tupras told the U.S. State Department in
August that it had cancelled contracts to supply Iran with
gasoline and data showed in September there were no deliveries
in August. 
 * BP confirmed in July it had stopped supplying jet fuel to
Iran Air at Germany's Hamburg airport. BP declined to give a
reason for ending the contract, but the halt in supply followed
reports Iranian aircraft had been denied fuel because of the
latest set of U.S. sanctions. 
 * Key shipping associations have created clauses in
contracts enabling ship owners to refuse to deliver refined
petroleum cargoes to Iran. 
 * Lloyd's of London said on July 9 it would not insure or
reinsure petroleum shipments into Iran. 
 * South Korea's GS Engineering & Construction cancelled a
$1.2 billion gas project in Iran on July 1 following the
imposition of U.S. sanctions. 
 * Spain's Repsol said on June 28 it had pulled out of a
contract it won with Royal Dutch Shell to develop part of South
Pars gas field in Iran.
 * Malaysia's Petronas stopped supplying gasoline to Iran, a
company spokesman said on April 15. 
 * Luxury carmaker Daimler announced plans on April 14 to
sell its 30 percent stake in an Iranian engine maker and freeze
the planned export to Iran of cars and trucks. The announcement
followed similar action by German insurers Munich Re and Allianz
. 
 * India's largest private refiner, Reliance Industries,
would not renew a contract to import crude oil from Iran for
financial year 2010, two sources familiar with the supply deal
said on April 1. 
 * Oil trading firms Trafigura and Vitol stopped gasoline
sales to Iran, industry sources said on March 8.
 * Ingersoll-Rand Plc, a maker of air compressors and cooling
systems for buildings and transport, said it will no longer
allow subsidiaries to sell parts or products to Tehran. 
 * Oilfield services company Smith International said on
March 1 it was actively pursuing the termination of all its
activities in Iran. 
 * Caterpillar, the world's largest manufacturer of
construction and mining equipment, said on March 1 it had
tightened its policy on not doing business with Iran to prevent
foreign subsidiaries from selling equipment to independent
dealers who resell it to Tehran. 
 * German engineering conglomerate Siemens said in January it
would not accept further orders from Iran. 
 * Glencore ceased supplying gasoline to Iran in November
2009, according to traders. 
 * Chemical manufacturer Huntsman Corp announced in January
its indirect foreign subsidiaries would stop selling products to
third parties in Iran. 
 * Accounting giants KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Ernst
& Young declared themselves free of any business ties to Iran. 
 
 STILL DEALING WITH IRAN 
 * China is in talks with Iran to use the Chinese yuan to
settle transactions of oil and projects. 
 * Russia built Iran's first nuclear power station near the
Gulf port city of Bushehr. Iran began loading fuel into the
plant on Aug. 21. 
 * The U.S. Government Accountability Office reported in
April that 41 foreign companies were involved in Iran's oil,
natural gas and petrochemical sectors from 2005 to 2009. In a
report in May, the GAO said seven of those companies received
U.S. government contracts worth nearly $880 million.
 These were: Daelim Industrial Company of South Korea; Eni;
PTT Exploration and Production of Thailand; Hyundai Heavy
Industries of South Korea; and GS Engineering and Construction
of South Korea. 
 * Russia's Gazprom confirmed in March it was in talks with
Iran on developing the Azar oilfield and has also expressed
interest in Iran's giant South Pars field. 
 * Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said on June 10 that a $7.6
billion project for export of Iranian natural gas to Pakistan
would be unaffected by the imposition of new U.N. sanctions

 By James Pomfret
 GUANGZHOU, China, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Chinese exporters could
withstand further yuan gains of almost 6 percent against the
dollar before they started losing money, a Reuters poll at the
country's top trade fair showed.
 If the Chinese currency rose to 6.28 per dollar, some 5.9
percent above current levels, respondents said they would face
heightened pressure to raise the prices of goods to bolster
margins.
 Since China depegged the yuan  in mid-June,
allowing it to rise around 2.6 percent against the dollar, 83
percent of manufacturers say their exports have suffered,
according to the poll of 102 small-and medium-sized firms at
China's largest trade event, the Canton Fair.
 ""It's not fair for us,"" said Li Lei, a manager of Photo USA
Electronic Graphic which was running a booth at the fair.
 ""Our margins are very thin in the first place ... by
pressuring our currency, they're hurting us,"" he added referring
to U.S. calls for China to ramp up the yuan ahead of mid-term
Congressional elections and a G20 leaders meeting in November.
 Speculation of a possible deal on currencies between Beijing
and Washington was fuelled on Tuesday when China's central bank
surprised markets by raising interest rates for the first time
in nearly three years, boosting the dollar. [ID:nSGE69I0HU]

Canton Fair export poll
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 ONE IN FIVE OPTIMISTIC
 Despite frustration at a stronger currency compounding a
troubling year of wage and raw material cost rises, only two
percent of exporters said business was becoming unsustainable
while 22 percent were optimistic about their prospects next
year, versus 20 percent saying they were pessimistic.
 This chimes in with China's latest export data in September
that showed slowing but still robust 24.1 percent growth from a
year earlier. [ID:nLDE69C027] [ID:nLDE63P1HY].
 With Wen Jiabao and other Chinese leaders wary of a stronger
yuan appreciation stoking social tensions and hurting exporters,
the poll results suggests factories may be more resilient than
thought, partly given a tendency to understate profit margins.
 An earlier poll by Reuters at the same fair in April
suggested firms could only withstand a mild appreciation to 6.5
yuan to the dollar. The yuan now stands at around 6.65.
 The consensus view from the market is that the yuan will
appreciate only moderately by year end, while one-year NDFs
imply 12-month yuan appreciation of around 3 percent.
 
 FEWER CHEAP GOODS?
 The biannual Canton Fair is considered a barometer for
Chinese trade and is a magnet for tens of thousands of foreign
buyers sourcing all manner of Chinese goods from lawn mowers to
tractors and plastic Christmas trees.
 While 55 percent of exporters polled said the impact of
another 3 percent appreciation would be severe, others said they
were also learning to cope by tweaking strategies, making
higher-value
goods, entering new markets and hiking prices.
 ""We have made a deal with our buyers to bear half the extra
costs,"" said Chen Nanwu, a rechargeable battery maker from
Zhejiang in eastern China. ""But that's only for old clients.""
 A surge in workers wages over the summer amid labour
shortages in factory hubs like the Pearl River Delta, along with
rising raw material costs, have also eroded margins. Some 47
percent of firms said production costs had risen more than 10
percent this year.
 ""Last year it was of course cheaper. This year it's a
problem,"" said Uwe Von Briel, director of Maratec, a German farm
equipment maker sourcing machinery at the fair. ""Now I can buy
cheaper stainless steel tubes and fittings in Europe and
Turkey.""
 But others said that, with few alternatives to China as a
haven for cheap goods, its competitiveness would only slide to
an extent.
 ""A ten to fifteen percent increase (in prices) is still
resistible because we have no other choice,"" said Shahzad
Khaliq, the COO of Tajir China, a Pakistani trading firm buying
around $300,000 of electronics and audio-visual goods at the
fair.
 ""India is not producing the same things as China and other
countries like Korea are too expensive.""
 The poll spanned five sectors including auto parts,
machinery, consumer electronics, electrical parts and
construction materials.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against a basket
of currencies on Wednesday, as appetite for higher-yielding
currencies revived after being jolted by a surprise interest
rate hike in China.
 The dollar index eased 0.6 percent to 77.717 <.DXY> after
climbing more than 1.6 percent the previous day, staying well
above a 10-month low of 76.16 struck last week.
 Analysts said the market's reaction to the previous day's
move by China was overblown, and with the U.S. Federal Reserve
expected to ease monetary policy further next month any dollar
rebound would be short-lived.
 ""I think the move itself indicated how excessive the
positioning in the market was, but any correction in the dollar
will be short and shallow,"" said Derek Halpenny, European Head
of Global Currency Research at BTM-UFJ. ""The main driver will be
QE from the Fed and that should weigh on the dollar.""
 Investors had increased their bets against the dollar in
recent weeks and had gone long on currencies like the euro and
the Australian dollar on heightened expectations the Fed will
unveil a second round of quantitative easing.
 Those stretched positions had increased chances of a
short-covering bounce for the greenback.
 ""The dollar's move down through September went too far and
was overdone. This bounce we saw is part of a healthy
correction,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at
Rabobank.
 ""The dollar's weakening trend remains intact, as China's
rate hike will not be slowing down its economy significantly and
this is just a temporary pause in 'risk-on' trades."" 
 The U.S. currency is often seen as a safe haven and gains
when appetite for riskier assets or growth-linked currencies
suffers.
 
 ON TRACK FOR QE
 Several Fed officials indicated on Tuesday the U.S. central
bank will soon offer further monetary stimulus, with one saying
$100 billion a month in bond buying may be appropriate.
[ID:nN19258951].
 In the UK, minutes from the Bank of England's last monetary
policy committee meeting showed a three-way split, with one
member voting for QE. [ID:nBOE004351]
 That saw sterling fall to the day's low against the euro and
give up some of its gains against the dollar.
 The pound edged up against the dollar as UK finance minister
George Osborne gave details of the harshest government spending
cuts in decades on Wednesday, taking an axe to the welfare state
in an effort to reduce a record budget deficit.
 Analysts say such cuts could hurt growth and prompt the BOE
to keep monetary policy easy, keeping pressure on the pound in
the medium term.
 The euro rose 0.6 percent to 87.94 pence  while
the pound edged up to $1.5740 .
 The euro was up 0.1 for the day at $1.3836 , steadying
from its 1.6 percent slide the previous day. It had fallen
sharply as investors trimmed some risk-taking positions after
China raised interest rates by 25 basis points, its first such
action in nearly three years.
 The move spurred concerns that it could mark the start of a
more aggressive phase of monetary tightening, dampening Chinese
and global growth and denting China's voracious demand for
commodities. [ID:nSGE69I0HU].
 The euro also gained against the yen , drawing
some support from higher Chinese shares <.SSEC>.
 But the dollar dipped 0.3 percent to 81.24 yen , not
far from its 15-year low of 80.88 yen.
 The higher-yielding Australian dollar rose 1 percent to a
session high of $0.9790  regaining some ground after
sliding more than 2 percent on Tuesday.

 By Gernot Heller and Joern Poltz
 BERLIN, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Germany will more than double its
growth forecast for 2010, a cabinet source said on Wednesday,
and the Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) produced a
matching forecast for Europe's largest economy this year.
 ""It will be 3.4 percent for this year and 1.8 percent for
next year,"" the cabinet source, who was familiar with the growth
forecasts, told Reuters.
 Berlin, which will release its latest forecasts on Oct. 21,
had previously predicted 1.4 percent growth for 2010.
 The new forecasts point to a faster-than-expected recovery
but are slightly below estimates made last week by leading
economic research institutes for 3.5 percent growth in 2010 and
2.0 percent growth in 2011.
 Earlier on Wednesday, the DIHK released its thrice-yearly
survey of more than 25,000 companies, stating that the recovery
had become sustainable and domestic demand would pick up in the
months ahead. [ID:nBZNKLE62H]
 The DIHK said it expected 3.4 percent growth in 2010 and 2.4
percent growth in 2011, while unemployment would fall below the
key psychological 3 million mark in 2011 to 2.9 million.
 ""Firms' business expectations are improving, although at a
weaker pace,"" the DIHK said. ""Some uncertainty is mixing with
the general optimism over the economic outlook.""
 Germany emerged from its deepest post-war recession in the
second quarter of last year and is staging a strong recovery
which is spreading from its export sector to domestic demand.
 
 CURRENCY THREAT?
 But the economy will come under pressure if the euro 
rises to $1.50, DIHK chief economist Volker Treier said, noting
that he did not expect it to rise that much.
 ""The air is thin around $1.50,"" said Treier.
 Treier said he expected the euro to trade between $1.40 and
$1.45 in the near term. The currency was trading at around $1.38
in midday trade.
 Germany's main foreign trade group told Reuters on Tuesday
the economy would grow by less than 1.5 percent in 2011, losing
steam under the twin threats of protectionism and a spiral of
currency devaluations. [ID:nLDE69I1W3]
 Currency tensions have escalated in recent weeks in the
run-up to meetings of the Group of 20 leading nations in South
Korea, with countries at odds over what exchange rates are
appropriate for fostering balanced growth. [ID:nTOE69E02T]
 Treier said China's surprise interest rate hike on Tuesday
had little impact for Germany, and was modest and appropriate.

baht
 * But most expect an increase in December, the next meeting
 * Central bank expects core inflation to rise next year
(Adds Reuters poll, details)
 By Orathai Sriring
 BANGKOK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Thailand's central bank left
its main interest rate unchanged at 1.75 percent on Wednesday,
pausing after two straight increases and citing risks from a
slowing global economy, but it signalled tighter credit ahead.
 Thailand joins other countries in holding back increases in
borrowing costs in the face of faltering global demand and
growing tension between developed and emerging economies over
global flows into high-yielding markets.
 Last week, South Korea unexpectedly held rates. Indonesia
and the Philippines also held off this month.
 But the Bank of Thailand, in its first decision under new
chief Prasarn Trairatvorakul, said rates remained on an upward
trend and were not yet ""normalised"" after falling from April
2009 to a record low to help Southeast Asia's second-biggest
economy recover from the global downturn.
 That comment pushed bond yields up in anticipation of
higher rates ahead. Five-year Thai government bond yields were
at 2.47 percent, down 5 basis points from Tuesday but up from
2.45 percent earlier.
 Most economists expect the central bank to lift its policy
rate by 25 basis points to 2.0 percent at its next meeting in
December, according to a Reuters survey of 16 economists taken
after Wednesday's announcement.
 China's decision on Tuesday to increase borrowing costs for
the first time in three years was a factor in the Thai
decision, along with the risk of a global slowdown, the central
bank said.
 ""The risk that decelerated global growth may adversely
impact Thai exports remains. Meanwhile, the outlook on
inflation pressure remains unchanged,"" the bank said in a
statement.
 It pointed to faltering recovery in the United States and
Japan, where central banks are easing policy, and risks in
debt-ridden Europe.
 It did not cite the baht as a decisive factor for holding
rates although the currency has risen 11 pct this year, raising
concern from exporters and prompting the government to impose
steps to curb fund inflows.
 Economists had until recently expected a rate rise at this
meeting. But a Reuters survey this week showed 11 of 18
analysts expected the central bank to pause for now.
 The Bank of Thailand had tightened by a quarter of a point
in both July and August as it started a ""normalisation"" of
policy after leaving rates at a record low of 1.25 percent from
2009.
 ""The BoT is expected to return to policy rate normalisation
inevitably at some point in 2011,"" said Usara Wilaipich, an
economist at Standard Chartered Bank, noting that recent floods
could push up some food prices and spur inflation.
 STRONG EXPORTS
 Thailand's economy is showing signs of continued strength,
particularly in exports, despite the strong baht.
 Exports hit a record high in September, giving a far higher
trade surplus than expected at $3.07 billion, data on Wednesday
showed, and the Commerce Ministry said shipments would rise at
least 20 percent this year despite the rise in the baht.
 A rate rise later this year remains possible, said David
Cohen, an economist at consultants Action Economics in
Singapore.
 ""The better-than-expected September exports reported just
earlier offers some encouragement that the economy is still
growing,"" he added.
 Concerns from exporters prompted the government to slap a

 * Any Japan cerium shortage would have global impact
 * Diplomatic spat or not, Chinese control threatens supply
 * China accounts for 97 pct of global rare earth supply
 By Tim Kelly and Chikako Mogi
 CHIGASAKI, Japan, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Supplies of a
brick-red polishing powder crucial for Japan's electronics
industry could run out soon and the shortage may persist even
if Japan sidesteps a Chinese embargo on the main ingredient, a
metal called cerium.
 Even before Japan's latest diplomatic spat with the
producer of 97 percent of the world's rare earth metals,
concern about China's ability to disrupt global supply chains
had surged as the country slashed shipments of a score of the
exotic metals.
 The cuts, which translated into a squeeze of 40 percent for
cerium, the most critical metal, are still in place and there
is a chance of more next year, said Toshio Nagayama, a general
manager at AGC Seimi Chemicals in Chigasaki, a town near Tokyo.
 But even without further supply interruptions, makers of
flat panel TVs and hard disk drives, in particular, could face
critical shortages as soon as next month, besides soaring
prices.
 ""Companies don't have enough abrasive in stock to see them
through,"" said Nagayama, whose firm is one of three Japanese
companies that make 80 percent of world supplies of the
abrasive. ""The serious pinch in supply will be in November and
December.""
 The prospect is worrying Japanese firms, which take 56
percent of China's rare earth exports. They face a further cut
of as much as 30 percent in supply next year, according to
Chinese media, although the country's commerce ministry has
denied the claim.
 Cerium is a dull silver malleable ingredient of the
abrasive powder used to polish sheets of glass as thin as
credit cards, between which television makers sandwich drops of
liquid crystal to make flat panel displays.
 It is also used by makers of the glass hard disk drives
that are rapidly displacing less robust aluminium drives in
devices designed to stand up to the rigours of mobile
computing.
 China issued export quotas for only 30,258 tonnes of cerium
by the end of July, down 40 percent from last year, saying it
was a necessary step to protect the country's environment.
 CHINA'S EDGE IN WOOING TECH FIRMS
 China's squeeze gives it an edge in attracting technology
companies hungry for its ready supplies of rare earths.
 Nagayama's employer, AGC Seimi, and its two Japanese
rivals, Showa Denko and Mitsui Mining and Smelting, are
scrabbling for supplies.
 Together, the three companies make around 12,000 tonnes of
the cerium abrasive a year, or four-fifths of global output, an
industry source said.
 Scared their abrasive will run out, customers are asking
for five times more than usual and prices have soared, Nagayama
said.
 Japan says cerium costs up to $80 a kg, a jump of 16 times
in less than a decade. AGC Seimi is promising existing
customers regular shipments at a higher price. New buyers are
turned away.
 Companies will just have to get used to the heftier
expense, Nagayama said.
 ""It is a serious concern and a burden to our customers,""
Sadao Senda, president of rival Mitsui Mining, told a news
briefing in Tokyo in September.
 Senda, who also chairs a Japanese mining industry body,
said he was consulting with customers but did not say how he
would guarantee supplies.
 Much of AGC Seimi's output, according to the industry
source, goes to its parent company, Asahi Glass, which turns
out a quarter of the world's LCD glass sheets.
 Another chunk ends up at leading glass hard disk drive
maker Hoya Corp.
 The shadow they cast across the component supply chain
means any production cut caused by a cerium abrasive shortage
will spread to the United States and Europe.
 Both Asahi Glass and Hoya declined to comment on whether
the squeeze would force output cuts, as did Sharp Corp, Japan's
leading maker of flat panels, and Sony Corp, which are one step
along in the supply chain.
 Panasonic spokesman Akira Kadota said his company had no
plan to cut production of TV sets.
 Alternatives include recycling, made viable by the price
jump, and cerium sources outside China, officials of Asahi
Glass and other firms said. Despite its name, cerium is not
scarce and is as common as copper or zinc.
 There is a mine at Sillamae in Estonia and another at
Mountain Pass, California in the United States. Others are
planned in Vietnam, Kazakhstan, India and even Mongolia.
 The challenge, however, is not finding deposits but having
the equipment to dig it up and ship it to cerium-famished
Japan, says Joji Sakurai, head of Mitsubishi Corporation
Unimetals, a unit of Japan's No.1 trading company, Mitsubishi
Corp.
 That snag will not be overcome in time to relieve the
imminent pinch in supply, he added.
 ""There is no alternative source readily available,"" Sakurai
said at his firm in Tokyo. ""It's the worst I've seen it in more
than 30 years working.""
 And even when those shipments start, China will remain the
dominant source of the rare earth elements.
 Molycorp Inc, operator of Mountain Pass, sees global demand
of some 220,000 tonnes by 2015, from less than 150,000 tonnes
now.
 Nine-tenths of that will still be dug up in China, leaving
Japanese firms at the sharp end of China's whims for years to
come.

 * European stocks lifted by UK QE prospects
 * Dollar slips against major currencies
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Financial markets on Wednesday
recovered some of the composure lost after China's surprise
interest rate hike, with stocks slightly higher and the dollar
falling back from the previous session's sharp gains.
 Wall Street also looked set for small gains following
Tuesday's 1.6 percent loss on the S&P 500 index <.SPX>.
 China triggered a global risk sell-off on Tuesday when the
People's Bank of China's (PBOC) raised benchmark interest rates
by 25 basis points, the first increase in nearly three years.
 The move stoked fears among investors about further
tightening in one of the global economy's main drivers and
coincided with an increase in tensions over global currency
policies ahead of a meeting of Group of 20 finance ministers
this weekend.
 Investors also digested news that Bank of America 
and possibly other U.S. banks may be forced to take back
billions of dollars in mortgages that should not have been
bundled into bonds.
 Such concerns have brought to a halt a solid risk rally that
saw MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> hit a more
than two-year high last week.
 The underlying driver for the rally -- the Federal Reserve's
expected buying of assets under a renewed quantitative easing
programme -- remains in place.
 But there are also jitters about whether this will be scaled
back as a result of the week G-20 meeting.
 Equity markets were playing it relatively safe.
 The MSCI index was up 0.1 percent while Europe's
FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was up about 0.3 percent, helped by
the latest Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee minutes,
which boosted expectations of further UK quantitative easing.
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed down 1.65 percent,
with exporters shaken by fears of slowing Chinese growth.
 
 DOLLAR SLIPS
 The dollar fell against a basket of currencies for the first
time in four sessions as appetite for higher-yielding currencies
stabilised following the sharp reaction to China's rate move.
 It dipped 0.6 percent .DXY> after climbing more than 1.6
percent on Tuesday.
 ""The dollar's move down through September went too far and
was overdone. This bounce we saw is part of a healthy
correction,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at
Rabobank.
 The U.S. currency is often seen as a safe haven and gains
when appetite for riskier assets or growth-linked currencies
suffers.
 Britain's pound was also in focus after the BoE minutes and
as the government prepared to give details of a programme of
huge budget cuts.
 Data also showed UK public borrowing rose to a record high
for September last month. [ID:nUKLKLE665]

1558,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2010 05:52AM ET</span>",Russia's 17-year drive to join the WTO," Oct 20 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama's economic adviser
Larry Summers said on Wednesday that Washington was very
encouraged by progress on Russia's World Trade Organization bid
and hoped Moscow would complete WTO accession within a year.
[ID:nLDE69J083]
The following are key facts about Russia's 17-year-old bid
to join the WTO.
 
 * Russia applied for membership in the WTO's predecessor,
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), in June 1993
and held the first round of working party accession talks in
1995. The first draft report of the working party, a major
foundation for prospective membership, was circulated in 2004.
 
 * Russia, whose $1.2 trillion economy depends heavily on
natural resources exports, is the largest country still outside
the 153-member organisation. Its bid is the longest ever; China
joined the WTO in 2001 after a 15-year process.

 * Russia is seeking to diversify its economy away from the
natural resources sector and says WTO membership will improve
access to global markets for its goods.
 
 * The World Bank estimates that WTO entry could increase the
size of the Russian economy by as much as 3.3 percent in the
medium term and 11 percent in the long term. The World Bank
expects Russian import tariffs would fall from 14 percent on
average to 8 percent. 
 
 * Sceptics say Russia stands to lose out from membership.
Russian magazine Expert estimated that as a member Russia will
lose domestic market equal to $90 billion to foreign companies
while benefits for domestic companies will amount to $23 billion.
 
 * Russia was worst hit by the 2008 economic crisis among
global emerging economies due to its dependency on oil exports.
In response, the government of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
launched a massive campaign to support domestic industries.
 
 * At the height of the crisis Russia introduced a series of
protectionist measures such as higher export duties on imported
cars, agricultural machinery and petrochemical products. The
government also provided generous state support to industry.
 
 * Putin surprised the West and threw WTO negotiations into
disarray by announcing in June 2009 that Russia would join as
part of a nascent customs union with ex-Soviet neighbours
Kazakhstan and Belarus.
 
 * The customs union was created on Jan 1, 2010 with the
three counties pursuing their WTO accession talks separately.
Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan aim to create a common economic
area without borders in 2012.
 
 * President Barack Obama, who has sought to ""reset""
long-strained ties with Moscow, and Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev said in June 2010 they had instructed their negotiators
to resolve technical issues by the end of September to clear the
way for Russia to join the WTO.
 * Russia resumed accession working party negotiations in
June 2010 with agriculture subsidies, intellectual property
rights, import tariffs on pork and cars and new export duties on
copper and nickel as the remaining stumbling blocks. 
 
 * Russian Agriculture Minister Yelena Skrynnik said on Sept
30, 2010 she had agreed with members of the Cairns group of
agricultural exporters that Russian agriculture subsidies could
be doubled to $9 billion a year in 2011-2012.
 
 * Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said on Oct 1
Russia and the United States had met the Sept 30 deadline to
resolve key hurdles. He said accession could be agreed within
2-4 months and that the accession procedure could take six to 12
months after that, indicating membership was likely in 2011.
 
 * Putin, seen as Russia's paramount leader, struck a more
cautious note, saying negotiations could drag on indefinitely.
 
 * A senior Russian official said the removal of the Cold
War-era Jackson-Vanik amendment, which tied U.S. trade relations
to emigration rights for religious minorities, would serve as an
indication that U.S. intentions were sincere.

 By Guy Faulconbridge
 MOSCOW, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Russia could join the World Trade
Organisation within a year after talks on Moscow's 17-year-old
bid made good progress, President Barack Obama's senior economic
adviser said on Wednesday.
 ""We are certainly hopeful that well before 12 months from
now, this process (Russia's WTO accession) will have been
completed,"" outgoing White House National Economic Council
director Larry Summers told reporters.
 Summers, in Moscow for talks with officials including Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin's senior adviser on foreign economic
relations, cautioned that it was ""not yet time for celebration"".
 ""But we can take extraordinary satisfaction in the progress
that has been made,"" he said. ""The end is in sight.""
 Russia has been seeking WTO membership since 1993 and with a
gross domestic product of $1.2 trillion is by far the largest
economy outside the 153-member organisation.
 Full U.S. support for Russia's bid -- the longest accession
talks in the WTO's history -- would pave the way for entry and
mark Russia's integration into the world economy 20 years after
the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union.
 ""In many ways this is the final bit of business completion
from a post-World War Two architecture in which Russia had not
been included,"" Summers said.
 Getting Russia into the WTO has become a goal of the ""reset""
in ties that Obama has forged with Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev after the arguments which characterised the presidency
of George W. Bush.
 
 ""END IN SIGHT""?
 Talks on Russia's WTO entry accelerated after a June summit
in Washington when Obama and Medvedev urged negotiators to
buckle down and reach a deal by the end of September 2010.
 Officials on both sides say that deadline has been broadly
met but have given few details on what exactly has been agreed
or on what remains to be agreed. [ID:nLDE6901IT]
 U.S. officials said the issue of meat import quotas remained
as well as the diplomatic complexities of the multilateral
accession process in Geneva, the headquarters of the WTO.
 Summers' comments about the potential accession timeline
indicate that officials are seeking Russian entry ahead of
Russia's March 2012 presidential election and the November 2012
presidential election in the United States.
 Summers said talks in Moscow with Russian First Deputy Prime
Minister Igor Shuvalov had been ""enormously constructive"" and
that they had touched on the hurdle of getting Georgian assent.
 Georgia, which lost two rebel regions after it was defeated
in a 2008 war with Russia, could theoretically veto Russia's
accession, though the United States and European Union are
likely to push Tbilisi to accept Russian entry.
 Summers said Shuvalov had recognised the need for ""some sort
of creative solution"" to overcome the impasse with Georgia.
 Russian officials say talks on WTO are continuing but that
they are still waiting for the United States to repeal the
Jackson-Vanik amendment, a Cold War-era provision that tied U.S.
trade relations to emigration rights for religious minorities.
 Summers said Jackson-Vanik had served its historic purpose
and indicated Congress could repeal it as early as next year.

 ISTANBUL, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Turkey has added major highways
and two bridges linking Europe and Asia to its privatisation
programme and aims to complete the sales by the end of 2012, the
government said on Wednesday.
 Analysts expect the road and bridge privatisations,
including two suspension bridges across Istanbul's Bosphorus
Straits, to bring in revenue of between $5 billion and $7
billion.
 Some of Europe's top infrastructure firms, including Italy's
Astaldi and Atlantia, France's Egis Projects, and Spain's
Abertis and Brisa are eyeing the prospects in fast-growing
Turkey, bankers told Reuters in July.
 The Turkish economy is set to grow 6 percent to 7 percent
this year, after shrinking nearly 5 percent last year due to the
global crisis.
 Under the decision by the High Board of Privatisation,
published in the country's Official Gazette, the operating
rights for the bridges, roads and related facilities will be
awarded for 25 years.
 The four main highways and several link roads targeted for
sale include a major route linking Edirne, Istanbul and the
capital Ankara, as well as motorways in southern Turkey.
 Privatisations have recently focused on the energy sector,
with the sale of power production and distribution facilities.
The Privatisation Administration said last week all grids would
be in private hands by the first half of 2011.
 The programme nearly slowed to a halt last year due to
unfavourable market conditions due to the global crisis.
 According to the government's medium-term economic plan,
income from the sale of state assets is expected to be 3.9
billion lira ($2.7 billion) this year, jumping to 13.7 billion
lira in 2011, and followed by 12.7 billion lira in 2012 and 10.3
billion lira in 2013.

earths, causing offshore consumers to consider alternative
supply sources for the minerals which are used in everything
from TV screens and computers to mobile phones and toys.
 China supplies about 95 percent of the world's rare earths.
 Following is a list of winners and losers if China's rare
earths exports dry up:
 LOSERS
 MANUFACTURERS
 * Industrial manufacturers in Japan and Korea, which
consumed a fifth of the world's rare earths last year, would be
hardest hit by reduced Chinese exports. Sectors that would bear
the brunt of restricted supplies would be makers of metal
alloys, magnets, catalytic converters and polishing compounds.
 * In the United States, manufacturers of catalytic
converters would suffer the most, followed by the metal
alloying and ceramic-making sectors.
 * European Union consumers would face shortages mainly in
manufacturing of catalytic converters, given the high
concentration of auto-making in the region.
 WINNERS
 MINERS
 * Some new and mothballed rare earths producers would
likely get the green light to proceed if China's exports dried
up. Many of these projects did not make economic sense while
China completely dominated the market. The major projects are:
 * Mountain Pass, located in the United States and owned by
Molycorp Minerals: once the world's largest producer of rare
earths, the mine ceased removing ore from its open pit in 2002.
Molycorp has continued some production from existing stocks and
plans to restart mining an annual rate of 18,000 tonnes in
2012.
* Hoidas Lake (Canada, Great Western Minerals Group): the
project is at an advanced exploration stage with start-up
tentatively scheduled for post-2014 at an annual rate of
3,000-5000 tonnes a year.
* Nechalacho (Canada, Avalon Ventures Inc): early
exploration and costing work is underway to develop a project
in about five years producing 3,000-5,000 tonnes a year.
* Mt Weld (Australia, Lynas Corp): due to start up in 2011,
initially producing about 10,500 tonnes, rising to 21,000
tonnes annually in 2013.
* Dubbo Zirconia (Australia, Alkane Resources): could be
activated as early as 2013 at an annual rate of 2,500 tonnes.
 * Nolans (Australia, Arafura Resources): tentatively
scheduled to be in production in 2014 and operating at an
annual rate of 20,000 tonnes.
* Kvanefjeld (Greenland, Greenland Minerals & Energy): the
mine is being designed to produce 20,000 tonnes of rare earths
as a co-product to uranium. No start date has been disclosed.

(Adds detail, background)
 PARIS, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Schneider Electric raised its 2010
margin target on Wednesday thanks to higher quarterly sales and
said it would expand in Russia through the purchase of half of
medium-voltage specialist Electroshield.
 The world's largest maker of voltage equipment now expects
its EBITA (earnings before interest, tax and amortisation)
margin to reach 15.5 to 16 percent before restructuring costs
and the impact of acquisitions.
 Schneider was previously aiming for an EBITA margin of
around 15.5 percent.
 The company also said it expects organic sales to rise by a
high single-digit percentage in the second half.
 Schneider designs and manufactures industrial plugs,
automation systems and energy sensors, and it bought
distribution assets from nuclear firm Areva in June for 1.02
billion euros ($1.4 billion).
It competes with Germany's Siemens and ABB of Switzerland.
 Third-quarter sales rose 11.9 percent organically to 5.45
billion euros, with Industry unit volumes up 27.5 percent to 942
million and IT division sales up 11.9 percent to 703 million,
Schneider said in a statement.
 Organic sales growth excludes the effect of currency
movements, acquisitions and divestments.
 Foreign exchange fluctuations added 325 million euros to
sales in the third quarter, thanks notably to the appreciation
of the dollar against the euro.
 Schneider said it agreed to buy half of Electroshield-TM
Samara, which it said was the leader in medium-voltage products
in Russia with key positions in oil and gas, power generation
and electro-intensive industries, for 265 million euros.
 It said it could obtain full ownership of the company under
similar financial conditions.
 Schneider shares have gained 21.9 percent so far this year,
slightly outperforming the STOXX Europe 600 industrial goods and
services index, which has risen 20.9 percent.
 ABB will publish its third-quarter results on Oct. 28.

 * World has changed too much since 1985 Plaza Accord
 * Risks grow of go-it-alone policies fanning protectionism
 By Alan Wheatley, Global Economics Correspondent
 BEIJING, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Speculation of a grand bargain
by the Group of 20 to rebalance the global economy is swirling
ever faster thanks to China's surprise decision to raise
interest rates for the first time since 2007.
 Higher rates ought to push up the yuan, one element of the
mooted deal. Whispers that the Federal Reserve will go easy
with an expected second round of quantitative easing --
printing money to buy government bonds -- point to the quid pro
quo for China, which is alarmed at the prospect of the dollar's
debasement.
 Maybe there is something cooking. But if the G20 were to go
beyond broad brush strokes and devise a formula for reducing
the current account imbalances disfiguring the world economy,
it would be rewriting the history books.
 ""I think they're working on something,"" said Andrew Busch,
a foreign exchange strategist with BMO Capital Markets in
Chicago.
 ""I'm just not sure if it's going to produce the results
that everyone wants. The G20 is a large group. I'm not sure
everyone has the same interests,"" he said.
 There's the rub. The five signatories to the September 1985
Plaza Accord, widely viewed as the pinnacle of global economic
cooperation, had different interests: the United States, just
like today, was under intense domestic pressure to reduce its
current account deficit and boost manufacturing jobs by
bringing the high-flying dollar down to earth.
 Japan and West Germany, both with big surpluses, might have
wanted to keep the competitive edge that weak currencies gave
them. But, as fellow capitalist democracies, they at least
recognised the political forces at work in the United States
and signed the accord, which sent their exchange rates soaring.
 MIXED BUNCH
 The G20, by contrast, is a much bigger, disparate group of
rich and emerging economies. To be sure, it made an auspicious
debut when it supplanted the Group of Seven as the premier
forum for international economic policymaking. Coordination of
stimulus packages during the global financial crisis won high
marks.
 And China, the group's de facto No. 2, is alert to U.S.
political sensitivities. But, as its leaders repeatedly stress,
it is also still a developing country with a compulsion to keep
creating jobs to ensure stability.
 It also has an authoritarian, risk-averse government that
puts its own interests before global ones. The failure of
climate talks in Copenhagen springs to mind. On currency
policy, it is a stance that translates into caution and
gradualism.
 Moreover, the lesson China has taken away from the Plaza
Accord is that the yen's ensuing spike -- complemented by
deficit spending and loose monetary policy -- inflated a
property and stock market bubble in Japan that, when it burst,
ushered in two decades of economic stagnation and virtual
deflation.
 China's leaders might not face re-election, but they would
face virulent dissent if they struck a similar grand bargain
with U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.
 ""Clearly the 'bubble' and its bursting in Japan have a more
complex explanation than simply the monetary and fiscal mix of
1985-1987, but the fact that this is the most dramatic instance
of international engagement to tackle persistent current
account surpluses overshadows current debates about what the
appropriate response to Chinese surpluses should be,"" said
Harold James of Princeton University.
 Indeed, James, a professor of history and international
affairs, said experience down the decades shows that it is very
difficult to devise institutional mechanisms to change policies
to correct current account imbalances.
 For instance, pressure on West Germany and Japan at the
1978 Bonn G7 summit to act as global locomotives by expanding
fiscal policy led only to inflation and, indirectly, to the
fall of German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, James wrote in a
recent e-book for voxEU.org.
 ""The lesson of the past clearly indicates that a more
sophisticated approach is required rather than exerting massive
pressure for exchange rate adjustment and looser monetary and
fiscal policy,"" he said.
 KING'S WARNING
 A process of mutual policy assessment being steered by the
International Monetary Fund is one such avenue. But what
leverage in practice can the Fund exert over the United States
or China?
 Getting China to switch its model of growth entails
overturning deep-rooted political arrangements that have
bestowed favours on export-orientated coastal manufacturers and
put investment ahead of consumption for decades.
 ""In China and the other surplus countries, as in the
deficit countries, rebalancing implies a fundamental change in
the centre of gravity of the economic, and therefore political,
life of the societies in question,"" Jeffry Frieden, a professor
of government at Harvard University, wrote in the voxEU.org
book.
 In Frieden's view, the festering row over the yuan is
emblematic of the domestic and international conflicts that the
global financial crisis have sparked and will deepen.
 Governments are likely to turn inward as their constituents
show more concern for domestic matters than for global economic
cooperation, he argued.
 Heading off the temptation to circle the wagons is,
fundamentally, what is at stake at forthcoming G20 meetings in
South Korea -- a gathering of finance ministers in Gyeongju
this Friday followed by a summit in Seoul on Nov. 11-12.
 The World Bank estimates that increased protectionism
accounted for only 2 percent of the drop in trade during the
global financial crisis, compared with roughly half during the
Great Depression in the 1930s.
 But that does not mean globalisation is irreversible, no
matter how extensive worldwide production chains are.
 Bank of England Governor Mervyn King warned on Tuesday that
major surplus and deficit countries were pursuing directly
conflicting economic strategies.
 ""The need to act in the collective interest has yet to be
recognised, and, unless it is, it will be only a matter of time
before one or more countries resort to trade protectionism as
the only domestic instrument to support a necessary
rebalancing,"" King said.
 ""That could, as it did in the 1930s, lead to a disastrous
collapse in activity around the world. Every country would
suffer ruinous consequences -- including our own.""

1573,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2010 01:32AM ET</span>",Q+A-Why did China raise rates and what's next?," By Simon Rabinovitch and Kevin Yao
 BEIJING, Oct 20 (Reuters) - China surprised markets on
Tuesday with its first interest rate increase since 2007, the
clearest tightening step it has taken since the country's
stunning recovery from the global financial crisis.
 Here are some questions and answers about the significance
of the move.
(For more stories on the rate move and global market reaction,
see [ID:nN19266020]
 WHY RAISE RATES NOW?
 All explanations are unavoidably post-hoc, since virtually
no analysts or traders saw the rate increase coming.
 Most economists think that worries about inflation and
asset prices drove the decision. Although there is no evidence
that inflation is getting out of control, consumer prices have
been rising faster than Beijing's 3 percent annual target and
making for negative deposit rates in real terms.
 The government's credibility in managing inflationary
expectations was at stake. Months-long efforts to cool the real
estate sector had showed signs of coming undone, with people
once again concluding that property was a far better investment
and even a safer store for their wealth than bank deposits.
 The People's Bank of China made clear in the nature of its
rate rise that it wants savers to lock up more of their cash in
banks for longer periods. At the short end, it kept rates
unchanged on demand deposits. But at the longer end of time
deposits, it bumped rates up by 60 basis points.
 IS THIS THE START OF A TIGHTENING CYCLE?
 Many economists, though not all, believe Beijing has now
kicked off a cycle of rate increases. But as with so much in
China, this is seen as likely to be gradual, so that
policymakers can take time to gauge the impact of tightening.
 For example, UBS expects three rate hikes in 2011, Mizuho
Securities forecasts two before the middle of next year and
Deutsche Bank believes there will be two over the next 12
months.
 To some extent, asking whether a tightening cycle has
started misses the point. China began tightening policy late
last year, and the rate rise is simply an intensification of
that.
 After a surge in bank loans in 2009, Beijing has kept a lid
on credit growth this year through strict lending quotas. It
has also raised reserve requirements for all banks three times
to lock up more of their cash, while pushing through a fourth,
targeted reserve increase for six major banks last week.
 Many economists had discounted the possibility of a rate
increase so soon, because they believed that China preferred
such measures that control the quantity, not the price, of
money.
 Peng Wensheng, chief economist with CICC in Beijing, said
this preference was still very much in place, with inflation
set to peak soon and easy money in developed economies still
constraining China. Instead of further rate hikes, he said the
government would return to relying on reserve requirements,
lending controls and open-market operations.
 WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE YUAN?
 In a fully open economy, higher rates would normally
translate into upward pressure on the currency. But China is
far from fully open and it has repeatedly sworn off major
appreciation in its management of the yuan's exchange rate.
 The yuan  had been rising at a fast clip by
Beijing's standards, gaining almost 3 percent against the
dollar over the two months before the rate increase.
 The central bank decisively broke that trend on Wednesday,
setting the yuan's exchange rate sharply lower. Some traders
now believe that the government will put the brakes on
appreciation to ward off capital inflows.
 Moreover, higher rates mean the central bank has less need
to push for currency appreciation as a tightening tool.
 Nevertheless, China still faces heavy pressure from the
United States, Europe and others to allow for a stronger yuan,
so there could be a resumption of gradual appreciation of 3-5
percent a year before long.
 WHAT ABOUT CAPITAL INFLOWS?
 Part of the reason the rate rise caught the market off
guard was the belief that Beijing would not want to increase
its rate differential over the United States and risk sucking
in hot money.
 Officials are undoubtedly worried about capital inflows,
but the decision reveals a calculation that rising asset prices
rather than widening rate differentials are the main attraction
for investors chasing higher yields.
 China's capital account is already carefully controlled and
the coming months could bring more measures to thwart
speculators.
 But the government will avoid draconian steps, as indicated
by recent comments from Yi Gang, a central bank vice governor,
that capital controls could be harmful and therefore should be
limited.
 WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT DATA DUE THIS WEEK?
 China reports third-quarter GDP and a batch of September
data on Thursday. On the heels of the rate increase, the market
chatter is that there could be upside surprises, particularly
in consumer price inflation.
 Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast that inflation
edged up to 3.6 percent in the year to September from 3.5
percent in August, but some now say it could be closer to 4
percent. [ID:nTOE69D042]
 Leaving the specific numbers to one side, the rate rise is
more important in what it says about how the government is
reading the data.
 When he was a central bank vice governor, Zhu Min described
interest rates as a ""heavy-duty weapon"" in managing the
economy. China has long been gun-shy, keeping rates steady even
as its economy roared ahead after the global financial crisis
and those in its tow, from South Korea to Australia, raised
their rates.
 China's top leaders would have signed off on the rate
increase. In so doing, they have delivered a strong vote of
confidence in the Chinese economy and its resilience despite
sputtering recoveries in developed markets.

1574,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2010 12:40AM ET</span>",INTERVIEW-UPDATE 1-G20 should share view on fast FX moves-Japan," (For more stories on the Japanese economy, click)
 By Yoko Kubota and Linda Sieg
 TOKYO, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The Group of 20 should share a
common view on the need to restrain rapid and extreme currency
moves, Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Tetsuro Fukuyama
said on Wednesday, days ahead of a G20 finance ministers'
meeting.
 Strains over exchange rates are expected to dominate a
meeting of G20 finance ministers in South Korea starting on
Friday. Seoul also hosts a G20 leaders summit in November.
 ""In the competition to weaken currencies, what we need to
watch out for is the tendency for countries to become
protectionist,"" Fukuyama told Reuters in an interview.
 ""Without falling into protectionism, we should share the view
that rapid and extreme (currency) moves should be restrained. I
think that the debate at the G20 should start from trying to
share that common view,"" he said.
 ""Based on that, we would like to discuss what sort of (new)
framework there should be.""
 Fukuyama said there was no change in Japan's position on
currency intervention as stated by Prime Minister Naoto Kan, who
has said Tokyo would take decisive moves if needed.
 Japan intervened in the foreign exchange market on Sept. 15
to try to curb a rise in the yen that is threatening the
country's economy, but the Japanese currency is still close to a
15-year high below 81 yen.
 Tokyo has insisted, however, that its currency intervention
is qualitatively different from that of South Korea, which has
stepped in repeatedly to try to cap a rise in the won.
 Fukuyama is one of two politicians holding the post of deputy
chief cabinet secretary under Chief Cabinet Secretary
Yoshito Sengoku, who is the de facto No. 2 in Kan's government.
 EXTRA BUDGET, CHINA TIES
 Fukuyama also shrugged off concerns that a planned 5.05
trillion yen ($62 billion) extra budget the government wants to
enact to keep the economy afloat will stall in a divided
parliament, where opposition backing is needed to pass bills.
 ""In the current economic situation ... I don't think the
opposition parties will refuse to take part in debate on the
extra budget or act negatively about enacting it,"" he said.
 Japan's government cut its view on the economy on Tuesday,
describing the economic situation as being at a standstill in a
monthly economic report.
 Commenting on strained ties with China, Fukuyama stressed
that Asia's top two economies were mutually interdependent and
said it behooved both sides to try to get along and repeated
Tokyo's call for China, now overtaking Japan as the world's
second-biggest economy, to act responsibly as a global power.
 ""The two governments need to work to create a win-win
relationship,"" Fukuyama said.
 ""Of course, China is a major power now and we need to urge it
to fulfil its responsibility as such.""
 Sino-Japanese ties deteriorated sharply last month after
Japan detained a Chinese trawler captain whose boat collided with
Japanese patrol ships near disputed and uninhabited isles in the
East China Sea, called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China.
 The two governments are trying to arrange a formal meeting
between their leaders at the end of this month on the sidelines
of a regional summit in Vietnam.

 * Dollar takes breather after surging on China rate rise
 * Euro has major support at $1.3580
 * Shanghai shares rise, cross/yen pairs stabilise
 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The dollar dipped against a basket
of currencies on Wednesday, trimming gains it made after a
surprise rate hike by China spurred the market to lower risk
exposure, but was seen likely to stay supported due to the
potential for further short-covering.
 The dollar index dipped 0.2 percent to 78.041 after climbing
more than 1.6 percent the previous day.
 But its breach of resistance near 77.93, its Oct. 12 high,
and through 77.894, a 23.6 percent retracement of its
August-October slide, could pave the way for a move to the
78.96-98 area, which would be a 38.2 percent retracement of that
August-October drop.
 Investors had increased their bets against the dollar in
recent weeks on heightened market expectations for the Federal
Reserve to unveil a second round of quantitative easing as early
as November.
 That positioning had pointed to the risk of a short-covering
bounce in the dollar.
 ""I get the sense that the dollar could rise further in the
near term,"" said Hideki Amikura, deputy general manager for
Nomura Trust and Banking's foreign exchange section.
 ""Market moves fuelled by excessive liquidity stemming from
the United States may be drawing to a close,"" Amikura said.
 One supportive factor for the dollar is that some Fed
officials seem to be trying to prevent market players from too
aggressively factoring in prospects of additional U.S.
quantitative easing and its potential impact, Amikura said.
 The commodity-sensitive Australian dollar rose 0.4 percent to
$0.9744, regaining a bit of ground after sliding more than 2
percent on Tuesday.
 Investors had trimmed some of their risk-taking positions on
Tuesday after China raised interest rates by 25 basis points in
its first tightening in nearly three years.
 The move spurred concerns that it may mark the start of a
more aggressive phase of monetary tightening, dampening Chinese
and global growth and denting its voracious demand for
commodities.
 Traders had fretted that the yen could strengthen broadly if
Chinese and Asian shares were to fall sharply, but as it turned
out Chinese shares edged up 0.7 percent after having fallen
initially.
 The Australian dollar edged up 0.2 percent against the yen to
79.28 yen, with one trader citing Aussie/yen buying by Japanese
investors.
 Some analysts said the market's reaction the previous day
was overblown, and with the Federal Reserve set to ease monetary
policy further as early as next month any dollar rebound would be
short-lived.
 ""What I think will be short-lived is the weakness in Asian
and commodity currencies in particular,"" said Greg Gibbs, a
strategist at RBS in Sydney.
 ""I don't think the hike in China is too significant in terms
of actually slowing down growth there. I wouldn't view that as a
factor to be getting bearish on risk or bearish on Asian growth.""
 The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.3772, regaining some ground
after its 1.6 percent slide the previous day.
 The Euro has major support at $1.3580, a 38.2 percent
retracement of a rise from $1.2645 on Sept.10 to last Friday's
peak of $1.4161.
 The dollar dipped 0.3 percent to 81.37 yen.
 A string of Federal Reserve officials indicated on Tuesday
that the central bank will soon offer further monetary stimulus
to the economy, with one saying $100 billion a month in bond
buying may be appropriate.
 Federal Reserve Governor Elizabeth Duke, however, told the
Money Marketeers of New York University that more easing at the
Fed's November meeting is not a done deal.

 * U.S. investigating report of blocked shipments
 * Kyodo reports tighter checks holding up exports
 * China says production controls to protect reserves
 By Chris Buckley and Lucy Hornby
 BEIJING, Oct 20 (Reuters) - China on Wednesday denied a
report that the government plans to slash export quotas of rare
earth metals next year, seeking to ease international jitters
about China's stranglehold on supplies.
 Any cut in Chinese exports could rattle firms which use
the
metals to make parts for vehicles, computers and cell phones,
missiles and new energy technology.
 A spokesman for China's Commerce Ministry, Shen Danyang,
told Reuters that a report in the China Daily on Tuesday that
export quotas would be cut by 30 percent in 2011 were
""unfounded.""
 ""Reports in certain media that China will continue reducing
rare earth export quotas next year are entirely groundless and
this is purely a mistaken report,"" the ministry said in a
statement later.
 ""China will keep supplying rare earths to the world, but
will also continue imposing restrictions on the exploitation,
production and exports of rare earths to protect these
depletable resources,"" said the statement, adding that any
limits would abide by global trade rules.
 The denials may do little to reassure companies and foreign
governments nervous about supplies after the New York Times
separately reported that China had blocked some shipments to
the United States and Europe. U.S. officials said they were
checking the report.
 China is likely to remain the leading producer of rare
earth metals for years to come, with prices to double next
year, European producer AS Silmet of Estonia said on Monday.
 UNTAPPED RESERVES
 More than 90 percent of global production of rare earths
comes from China, although other countries have big untapped
reserves.
 Japan's Kyodo news agency reported that an unnamed
diplomatic source in Beijing said custom clearances of rare
earth shipments to the United States and Europe were being held
up by tighter inspections. The report did not mention any
outright embargo.
 The slowdown in shipments may reflect a sharp drop in
export quotas, which has left over-committed traders scrambling
to cover orders placed in the first half of the year, analysts
said.
 ""It's just that there aren't enough quotas, after the
second-half cuts. Some companies signed too many orders in the
first half, not realising the quotas would be cut back,"" said
Mary Zhang, rare earths analyst for Asian Metals in Beijing.
 ""There are no country-specific cuts. I think the reports
show that Japan and the other countries are coordinating action
to pressure China to loosen its export policy, because it's
true supplies are very tight.""
 Reports that China had halted shipments of rare earths to
Japan during a sea territory dispute has raised the spectre
that Beijing could use its dominance of supplies as a political
lever.
 A Japanese trading house official told Reuters that no rare
earth cargoes bound for Japan had cleared Chinese customs since
Sept. 21, but added the company has not confirmed the current
status of shipments to the United States and Europe.
 The China Daily cited an unnamed commerce ministry official
as saying Beijing would reduce export quotas to protect the
country's rare earth resources from over-exploitation.
 NO COMPLETE BAN
 China's reserves of rare earth dropped by 37 percent
between 1996-2003 and might run dry within 15 to 20 years if
the current rate of production is maintained, the Ministry of
Commerce said last week.
 Premier Wen Jiabao said earlier this month that China's
measures to control rare earths exports were geared to
""sustainable"" exploitation of the minerals and pledged not to
impose a complete ban on exports.
 China has been steadily reducing export quotas since 2005
for rare earth elements, which consist of 17 metals.
 Just three months ago, Beijing said it was slashing export
quotas for the metals by 72 percent for the second half of 2010
to 7,976 tonnes, compared to 28,417 tonnes a year ago. Total
quotas for 2010 were about 40 percent below 2009 levels.
 The People's Daily, in an editorial published on Monday,
said it was unrealistic to expect China to continue to meet 90
percent of global rare earth demand when it holds only 30
percent of total reserves.
 The Chinese Commerce Ministry said export quotas for 2011
would be reflect ""rare earth output, domestic and foreign
demand and the needs of sustainable development.""
 Japan last month accused China of halting shipments amid a
political dispute, sparking allegations that Beijing was using
its monopoly over the resources as a political tool.

 * Currency intervention, BOJ easing lift sentiment slightly
 * But yen strength clouds outlook for export-reliant economy
 * Investors say Tokyo should keep intervening to tame yen
 By Chikafumi Hodo and Mari Terawaki
 TOKYO, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Japanese retail investor sentiment
towards domestic stocks improved for the first time in six months
in October as share prices rose, though it remained near an
18-month low hit last month as the yen stayed strong, a Reuters
poll showed.
 Japanese shares got a boost earlier in the month after the
Bank of Japan cut interest rates to virtually zero and pledged to
pump more funds into the struggling economy.
 ""We are seeing effective policies such as currency market
intervention and credit easing steps. The outlook is positive as
the corporate outlook doesn't necessarily look bad,"" an investor
in his 50s said in the survey.
 Still, many investors were worried about the outlook for the
export-led economy as the yen held near a 15-year high against
the dollar, and think Tokyo should continue to intervene in the
currency market to help support the economy, the survey showed on
Wednesday.
 The Reuters sentiment index, calculated by subtracting the
percentage of investors who say they are bearish from those who
are bullish, edged up to minus 64 -- the first rise since April
-- from minus 70 in September -- the lowest since March 2009.
 The monthly survey of 695 Japanese individual investors was
conducted Oct. 4-7, during which time the benchmark Nikkei
average reached a two-month closing high in the wake of the BOJ's
easing announcement. The Nikkei was also up more than 7 percent
from the survey period the previous month.
 Japan intervened in the currency market last month for the
first time in six years to stem a rise in the yen that is
threatening a fragile economic recovery. But the yen has
continued to strengthen against the dollar since the
intervention, keeping investors nervous.
 The dollar stood around 81.40 yen on Wednesday, below the
level where Japan was seen to have intervened around 83 yen. The
greenback hit a 15-year low of 80.88 last week, not far from a
record low of 79.75 hit in 1995.
 ""Japan is losing its competitiveness against other countries
as the yen remains strong. Domestic demand will keep falling in
this kind of situation,"" an investor in his 60s said.
 The survey also showed that more than 60 percent of
respondents said the dollar in a range of 90-105 yen would be
favourable for the Japanese economy.

prices

 * Currency tensions rise ahead of G20 ministers' meeting
(Adds details, background)
 By Rie Ishiguro
 HIROSHIMA, Japan, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The yen's rise is a
major negative for Japan's economy, Bank of Japan Deputy
Governor Kiyohiko Nishimura said on Wednesday, highlighting
worries about yen strength as currency tensions look set to
dominate a Group of 20 finance ministers' meeting later this
week.
 ""The fact that the recent yen appreciation is causing a
deterioration of business sentiment is a big factor in putting
downward pressure on economic activity,"" Nishimura said in a
speech to business leaders in Hiroshima in western Japan.
 He also suggested the strong yen may prolong Japanese
deflation.
 ""There is a risk that the yen's appreciation will lower
consumer prices not only through worsening economic activity
but also through changes in import prices.""
 The dollar slipped to a 15-year trough below 81 yen late
last week. Japan intervened in foreign exchange markets in
September to try to curb gains in its currency which
policymakers fear could stifle export growth.
 ""The BOJ, no doubt, is biased towards further easing,"" said
Masamichi Adachi, senior economist at JPMorgan Securities
Japan.
 ""Countries cannot openly say they favour a weak currency
but many are putting their own interests ahead of others. If
developed economies continue to ease policy, this could once
more cause bubbles to start forming,"" Adachi said.
 CAPITAL FLOWS
 BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said in a newspaper
interview that the BOJ would consider expanding its new
asset-buying programme if the economy worsens further.
 Group of 20 finance ministers meeting in South Korea on
Friday will grapple with the global currency system as
developed and emerging countries trade barbs over competitive
devaluations.
 Nishimura also said capital flows into emerging economies
may cause overheating as many countries have not taken
sufficient tightening steps.
 Asian currencies are appreciating as low yields in
developed countries drive capital into the region, fanning
fears of inflation.
 The People's Bank of China surprised markets on Tuesday
with its first interest rate rise in nearly three years in a
bid to put a lid on inflation.
 Despite a bounce as high as 81.92 yen after China's rate
hike, analysts expect any dollar rebound to prove short-lived
due to widespread expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve
will print billions of dollars to try to lift the U.S. economy.
 The BOJ will hold its next policy meeting on Oct. 28, when
it will also release its twice-yearly outlook report on growth
and prices.
 Some analysts say the bank will likely revise down its
consumer price index forecast for the 2011/12 April-March
fiscal year to a negative figure from a rise of 0.1 percent,
and thus heighten expectations that the bank will keep rates
near zero for a long time.
 The BOJ surprised markets on Oct. 5 by cutting interest
rates and pledging to buy 5 trillion yen ($61 billion) worth of
assets to pump more money into the flagging economy.
 On Tuesday, Japan's government cut its view on the economy
for the first time since February 2009, saying it was now at a
standstill, highlighting the growing gulf between developed and
emerging countries at the heart of global currency tensions.
 Nishimura, a former university professor, has voted with
the board and stuck to the BOJ's official line on policy.

 Japan's Nikkei average <.N225> pared earlier losses but
still closed down 1.65 percent to book its lowest close in two
weeks after investors rushed to take profits on China's
unexpected tightening and after worries about some U.S. banks
pushed Wall Street lower.
 Shanghai stocks <.SSEC> ended flat after a volatile session
while Hong Kong <.HSI> came off its lows in the morning session

 FED BACK ON RADAR
 The dollar index dipped 0.4 percent <.DXY> after climbing
more than 1.6 percent the previous day while the
commodity-sensitive Australian dollar rebounded 0.8 percent
 after sliding more than 2 percent on Tuesday.
 Some analysts said the market's reaction the previous day
was overblown, and with the Federal Reserve set to ease
monetary policy further as early as next month, any dollar
rebound would be short-lived.
 ""What I think will be short-lived is the weakness in Asian
and commodity currencies in particular,"" said Greg Gibbs, a
strategist at RBS in Sydney.
 ""I don't think the hike in China is too significant in
terms of actually slowing down growth there. I wouldn't view
that as a factor to be getting bearish on risk or bearish on
Asian growth.""

 NEW YORK, Oct 19 (Reuters) - World stocks and commodity
prices fell sharply on Tuesday after China, the engine of
growth in an anemic global recovery, raised interest rates for
the first time since 2007 to curb its booming economy.
 Wall Street also was hit by fears that U.S. banks might be
on the hook for billions of dollars in souring mortgage bonds,
driving stocks to post their biggest loss in two months. For
details see: [ID:nN19153115]
 The dollar rallied broadly on China's unexpected
25-basis-point rate increase, a move that could mark the start
of a more aggressive phase of monetary tightening in the
world's fastest-growing major economy. [ID:nSGE69I0HU]
 Crude oil prices slid more than 4 percent, its biggest
single-day percentage decline since February, while copper
tumbled from 27-month highs and gold shed as much as 2.7
percent, set for its largest one-day drop since early July.
 The People's Bank of China said it would lift its benchmark
one-year lending and deposit rate, effective on Wednesday, in a
move analysts said may suggest Beijing and Washington are
working together to ease rising currency tensions.
 Traders cut their exposure to risk by taking refuge in U.S.
government debt and selling the euro and commodity-sensitive
Australian dollar. [ID:nN19134544]
 The Australian dollar, which last week rose above parity
with the U.S. currency for the first time since 1983, was hit
hardest, slipping 1.5 percent. The euro and sterling also fell
sharply.
 Investors feared China's quarter-percentage point rise in
interest rates could dampen Chinese and global growth while
slowing China's voracious demand for commodities.
[ID:nBJI002412]
 ""China's rate increase instantaneously pushed people to
take risk off the table,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of
research at GFT Forex.
 China ""is trying to clamp down on growth and that's going
to reflect badly on Australia, on Germany, on much of the world
economy as it readjusts to the idea that Chinese growth may not
be as torrid as expected,"" Schlossberg said.
 The dollar was up against a basket of major currencies,
with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 1.66 percent at 78.206.
 Trading in Tokyo was poised to open lower, with the
December futures contract that trades in Chicago for the Nikkei
225 <0#NK:> down 50 points at 9,495.
 Wall Street fell further in late trade on news that Bank of
America and potentially others may be forced to take back
billions of dollars in mortgages that should not have been
bundled into bonds.
 ""It's reminding investors of what was the main impetus for
the horrific sell-off we had a few years ago,"" said Eric Kuby,
chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management in
Chicago. ""If you were recently struck by lightning, you are a
little skittish when there is a thunderstorm.""
 Bank of America  shares fell 4.4 percent to $11.80
after a Bloomberg report, citing people familiar with the
matter, said investors PIMCO and BlackRock as well as the New
York Federal Reserve Bank were seeking to force the lender to
repurchase $47 billion in mortgage bonds.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> slid 165.07 points,

 GOLD SLIDES, OIL DROPS
 Oil fell on the dollar's strength and fears that demand
will slow from China.
 U.S. crude for November  delivery fell $3.59, or 4.32
percent, to settle at $79.49 per barrel, the biggest one-day
percentage dive since Feb. 4.
 In London, ICE Brent December crude  fell $3.27, or
3.88 percent, to settle at $81.10 a barrel.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  sank $36.10,
or 2.6 percent, to settle at $1,336 an ounce.
 U.S. Treasuries prices rallied as stock market losses
spurred demand for safe-haven U.S. government debt and several
Federal Reserve officials said easier monetary policy was
needed to support the economy. [ID:nN19559798]
 Several Fed officials said the Fed needed to implement a
more accommodative policy to fulfill its mandate to pursue the
highest level of employment consistent with price stability.
 ""The stock market was down and that gave Treasuries a bid,""
said John Spinello, chief fixed-income technical strategist at
Jefferies & Co. in New York. ""And Fed officials are talking
more and more about adding reserves to the system.""
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
10/32 in price to yield 2.48 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury
note  was break-even, yielding 0.36 percent.
 Overnight in Asia, Japan's Nikkei share average closed 0.4
percent higher <.N225>, extending a gain since September to 6.9
percent, but MSCI's index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> slipped 0.6 percent.

1585,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2010 05:28PM ET</span>","US, Turkey aim to boost trade, but not in textiles"," * U.S., Turkey launch new forum to boost bilateral trade
 * Kirk tells counterparts textiles a hard sell in Congress
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The top U.S. trade official
said on Tuesday the United States was unlikely to open its
market to more textile goods from Turkey, as the two sides
kicked off a high-level dialogue aimed at boosting trade.
 ""Turkey made a very strong case for what they would like to
see happen. We were equally practical in trying to help them
understand that this is a matter in which our Congress
exercises very strong prerogative,"" U.S. Trade Representative
Ron Kirk told reporters after the talks.
 Turkey, which this month also launched an effort to boost
trade with China, is one of many countries frustrated by high
U.S. tariffs on clothing and other textile goods.
 Although the U.S. textile industry has dwindled over the
years, the remaining companies are protected by double-digit
import duties much higher than the average U.S. tariff rate of
less than 2 percent.
 Kirk said it would be hard for President Barack Obama to
persuade Congress to waive those duties for Turkey, as the
United States has done for some of the world's poorest
countries to help foster economic growth.
 Tuesday's inaugural meeting of the U.S.-Turkey Framework
for Strategic Economic and Commercial Cooperation grew from a
commitment between Obama and Turkish President Abdullah Gul in
April 2009 to strengthen trade and economic ties.
 Kirk and U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke co-chaired the
meeting with Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan and
Foreign Trade Minister Zafer Caglayan.
 Locke said the Obama administration had identified Turkey
as a priority market as it attempts to double U.S. exports, and
will be taking two trade mission there in 2011.
 The two sides announced the formation of a new U.S.-Turkey
Business Council and said they were setting up a working group
to cooperate on protecting intellectual property rights.
 They also have plans to work on issues related to energy,
trade and investment promotion, regulatory cooperation,
scientific and agricultural cooperation.
 Last year, the United States exported about $7.09 billion
worth of goods to the country at the crossroads of Europe and
Asia and imported $3.66 billion.
 That makes Turkey one of the few nations that has a trade
deficit with the world's largest economy.
 Turkey's exports to the United States peaked at $5.4
billion in 2006 and have fallen in most years since then.
 Turkey hopes the fresh dialogue with Washington marks a new
era in relations and ""is determined to do as much trade as it
can with every country in the world,"" Caglayan said.
 Asked whether Turkey saw China or the United States as its
most important future trading partner, Babacan said Turkey was
committed to maintaining ""an open economy"" with all countries
since embarking on economic reforms in the early 2000s.
 ""We are implementing a multidimensional foreign policy and
a multidimensional trade policy. We just want to have a high
GDP for our country ... and we know this will flow through more
trade and investment,"" Babacan said.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The safe-haven dollar headed
for its best day in two months on Tuesday, while the euro and
commodity-sensitive Australian dollar tumbled after a surprise
interest rate increase from China prompted investors to cut
risk exposure.
 Investors feared a quarter-percentage point rise in China's
one-year lending rate could dampen Chinese and global growth
and slow the country's voracious demand for commodities, many
of which come from Australia.
 The dollar climbed to a two-week high versus the euro,
pushing the single currency near $1.37. Still, some analysts
said the market's reaction was overblown and with the Federal
Reserve set to ease monetary policy further as early as next
month, any dollar rebound will be short-lived.
 ""China's rate increase instantaneously pushed people to
take risk off the table,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of
research at GFT Forex. ""(China) is trying to clamp down on
growth and that's going to reflect badly on Australia, on
Germany, on much of the world economy as it readjusts to the
idea that Chinese growth may not be as torrid as expected.""
 The Australian dollar, which last week rose above parity
with its U.S. counterpart for the first time since 1983, was
hit hardest, slipping 2.2 percent to $0.9681. At current
prices, it marks the biggest daily percentage decline since
late June.
 The euro was down 1.6 percent at $1.3726, its biggest daily
drop since August and off a $1.4005 session peak, according to
trading platform EBS.
 It tumbled as low as $1.3713, the weakest in two weeks,
after U.S. stock selling accelerated on fears Bank of America
may be forced to buy back mortgages.
 Traders said the break of $1.3770 opens the door for a test
of $1.37, followed by $1.3637, its Oct. 5 low and around
$1.3580, the 38.2 percent retracement of its rise from Sept. 10
to Oct. 15.
 The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a
basket of six currencies posted its biggest daily gain since
August, last trading at 78.223, up 1.7 percent.
 DOLLAR STILL VULNERABLE
 Hobbled by zero interest rates and expectations of more
Federal Reserve easing to come, the dollar has been under
pressure since September. Analysts, however, say the
expectations of Federal Reserve easing have been priced in,
providing an opportunity for investors to take profits.
 The dollar's rebound began after the euro rose above $1.41
last week, an 8-1/2-month high. It continued on Monday after
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Washington would not
devalue the dollar for export advantage.
 Analysts cautioned, however, that any sustained dollar
seemed unlikely given expectations that U.S. interest rates
will remain low relative to most other major economies.
 ""The fundamentals are still pretty well lined up against
the dollar and I expect it to come under renewed pressure in
the near term,"" said Daniel Katzive, currency strategist at
Credit Suisse in New York.
 New York Fed President William Dudley said Tuesday that
employment and inflation are likely several years away from
being within the Fed's comfort zone.
 Societe General strategist Kit Juckes said the China news
was ""not a game changer"" and that high-yielding currencies such
as the Australian dollar and Brazilian real are likely to
attract buyers following their recent retreat.
 The dollar rose 0.4 percent to 81.56 yen, its best daily
gain since Japan intervened to weaken the yen on Sept. 15. It
hit a 15-year low beneath 81 yen last week. The Australian
dollar/yen exchange rate, an important barometer of risk
sentiment, fell 1.7 percent to 79.04 yen.
 The U.S. currency also rose 1.4 percent to 1.0311 Canadian
dollars after the Bank of Canada left interest rates at 1
percent and cut is growth forecast.

 * Alstom says has filed legal complaint against Eurostar

(Adds Eurostar comments, Alstom legal complaint)
 By Greg Roumeliotis and Caroline Copley
 LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Britain, Germany and rival
Eurostar all backed Deutsche Bahn's bid on Tuesday to run direct
high-speed rail services from London to continental European
cities through the Channel Tunnel, as a dispute over what trains
could use the tunnel intensified.
 The German rail operator, which was showing off one of its
trains at London's St Pancras station on Tuesday, aims to run
services three times a day between London and Amsterdam and
Frankfurt and hopes to start services by the end of 2013.
 Eurostar, the sole passenger train service operator running
trains through the tunnel since it was opened in 1994, supports
Deutsche Bahn's move, saying it is another step in the expansion
of high-speed rail travel across Europe.
 ""We welcome Deutsche Bahn's plans, we want them to help us
grow the rail passenger market together,"" Eurostar's chairman
Richard Brown told Reuters at the presentation of Deutsche
Bahn's plans at St Pancras.
 Deutsche Bahn had an ICE 3 train, a member of Siemens's
Valero series, which can hit 320 kilometres per hour, on
display at St Pancras station following what it called
successful safety tests. 
 
 ALSTOM LEGAL ACTION
 But Brown said French train maker Alstom has threatened
legal action over Eurostar's decision to pick Siemens as
preferred bidder for a 700 million-pound order for new
cross-Channel trains.
 Alstom and the French government have been vocal in opposing
Eurostar's preference for the Siemens trains, alleging there are
safety issues with using Siemens trains in the Channel Tunnel.
 ""They (Alstom) have threatened action against us in the UK
courts. As a result I cannot comment on this further,"" Brown
said. Asked if Alstom had communicated this threat to Eurostar
through its lawyers, Brown answered ""yes"".
 ""There is no safety issue. We followed a thorough and
comprehensive procurement process in line with EU regulation and
with board support,"" he added.
 An Alstom spokesman said the company had filed a complaint
at a London court against Eurostar over the Siemens order but
declined to give details.
 ""There is no really substantial argument against the Siemens
(train) technology,"" German transport minister Peter Ramsauer
told reporters at the St Pancras presentation, adding he would
discuss the issue with his French counterpart in Paris on
Wednesday.
 The Franco-British Intergovernmental Commission (IGC)
governing the operation of the Channel Tunnel is reviewing
regulations, such as those for trains that have a traction
system under their carriages, removing the need for locomotives
at each end.
 On Monday, a European Union source told Reuters that the
European Commission saw nothing wrong with Eurostar's
procurement process for the trains and that Alstom had not
officially referred the matter to European authorities.
 ""Our ICE 3 trains are very similar to the Valero trains that
Eurostar has ordered from Siemens, they are from the same
production line,"" a Deutsche Bahn spokesman said. Deutsche Bahn
has ordered 15 ICE 3 trains from Siemens for 500 million euros.
 ""The issues we will need approval for is distributed
traction and allowing our trains to split."" he added.
 One 400 metre-long train would travel to Brussels and then
split with one half going on to Amsterdam and the other half
travelling to Frankfurt via Cologne.
 
 GROWTH POTENTIAL
 In 2009, Eurotunnel made 44 percent of its 571 million euros
revenue from Eurostar which currently enjoys a monopoly on the
track as sole rail passenger service operator, and from freight
service operators. 
 Eurostar carried 9.2 million passengers through the tunnel
in 2009. Eurotunnel says that there is still around 50 percent
spare capacity.
 ""Today is a great historical event. We need and ask the
support of infrastructure managers in all countries involved in
this project. We are sure to need political support if we are to
succeed in doing so,"" Deutsche Bahn's chief executive Ruediger
Grube said in his presentation.
 Both Germany and Britain threw their support behind Deutsche
Bahn's plans, with UK Transport Secretary Theresa Villiers
saying they were a very important step for international rail
travel in Britain.
 ""The new services will give passengers greater choice and
foster competition with Eurostar. They will help meet growing
travel demand between our countries and connect two major
financial centres, London and Frankfurt,"" Villiers said.
 With congestion and security measures at airports extending
the average London to Frankfurt flight duration of 1 hour and 40
minutes significantly, the German railway operator argues that
passengers will view the alternative of going by train more
favourably.
Deutsche Bahn expects that journeys to Cologne will take just
under four hours with Frankfurt five hours away.
 ""I definitely like trains more than airplanes, but they are
really turning trains into planes on rail,"" said Andrea Mubi, a
35-year-old Italian looking at the ICE 3 at the train station
after getting off a Eurostar train from Paris.

Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Washington would not
devalue the dollar for export advantage. [ID:nLDE69I00W]
 Analysts said Geithner's comments may mean the United
States was trying to ease global tensions over exchange rates
ahead of a G20 meeting in November. Washington wants China to
allow more rapid appreciation of the yuan. Beijing and others
complain that dollar weakness is stoking inflation by pushing
money into their faster-growing economies.
 Analysts cautioned, however, that the dollar's rebound may
be short-lived given expectations that U.S. interest rates will
remain low relative to most other major economies.
 ""The fundamentals are still pretty well lined up against
the dollar. I expect it to come under renewed pressure in the
near term,"" said Daniel Katzive, currency strategist at Credit
Suisse in New York.
 High-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar and
Brazilian real are likely to attract buyers following their
recent retreat, said Societe General strategist Kit Juckes.
 He said the market's ""gut reaction is to sell commodity
block and emerging market currencies"" on the China news but
added the news was ""not a game changer.""

 U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce Francisco Sanchez told

 * Global currency face-off could also dent growth
 * Believes African countries institutionally stronger
 
 By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent
 LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - States like Somalia and Sierra
Leone could ultimately cost the international community more
money if they were destabilised by short-term cuts in Western
aid, Africa's main representative to the IMF said on Tuesday.
 Executive director Samuel Itam, who represents 20 African
countries at the IMF board including South Africa and Nigeria,
told Reuters he understood why European governments, trying to
reduce record deficits, would target aid to Africa.
 But reducing aid could undo recent gains and create longer
term problems that would be more expensive to solve, he said. In
Sierra Leone, cutting aid would force the government ""...to find
other resources... or completely dismantle programmes,"" he said.
 ""It is an easy thing to -- there is no domestic political
reaction if you cut foreign aid,"" he said. ""But that is too
short-term and too myopic -- it will come back to hurt you in
the longer run. Medium term, if you want stability and peace you
have to contribute.""
 Africa could also be threatened if a global currency
stand-off worsened, but overall, the continent was better placed
than ever before to benefit from record commodity prices and
competition between developed and emerging powers, Itam said.
 He said that while new investment from China and elsewhere
was welcome, it was much more narrowly focused on single
investment projects and could not simply replace Western aid.
 Overall, he said his base case prediction was that Africa
would continue to grow by about 5-5.5 percent per year -- but
significant donor reductions or other shocks could reduce this
and it remained short of the 7-7.5 percent needed to seriously
reduce poverty.
 He said he was also concerned by rising global tensions over
currency strength, with the United States and China facing off
and many emerging economies keen to weaken their currencies to
promote exports. 
 Some worry that trade protectionism could result. ""That
could become adverse for sub-Saharan African countries as it
would eventually feed through to demand for their exports.""
 While South Africa might benefit in some ways from imposing
capital controls to cap currency strength as it would make
exports more competitive, its economy would also suffer as
controls would deter foreign investment, Itam said.
 ""Having a weaker currency would only bring temporary
benefit,"" he said.
 High commodity prices and international competition over
African resources have sometimes fuelled conflict and
corruption, but Itam said institutions were now much stronger.
 Countries such as Uganda were rigorous in ensuring money
from new oilfields was ringfenced, he said, adding that his own
country, Sierra Leone, would learn from its diamond-fuelled
civil war when it came to handling new potential oil wealth.
 ""I think the key change is that ordinary people understand
this and really demand transparency,"" he said. ""With Sierra
Leone, everyone knows diamonds were a disaster and I think that
will help us to do it better this time round.""

 PARIS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - French vouchers group Edenred
nudged up its 2010 profit goal after sales growth accelerated in
the third quarter, driven by strong demand in Latin America,
notably Brazil.
 Edenred -- which offers prepaid services such as meal
vouchers as well as payment, insurance and travel cards for
employees -- split from hotels group Accor on July 2 in the
largest listing of a French company on Euronext in two years..
 The company competes with catering services groups Sodexo
and Compass Group as well as card companies Mastercard and Visa.
 It said on Tuesday the quarter just ended saw the first
signs of a stabilising jobless rate in western Europe but added
that the economic climate remained challenging in eastern
Europe, notably Romania.
 Chief Executive Jacques Stern told a conference call he
expected the trends seen in the third quarter, when sales rose
7.3 percent like-for-like to 226 million euros ($314.2 million),
to continue in the final three months of the year. 
 ""What we are saying is that we had a better trend in the
third quarter which should be confirmed in the fourth quarter,""
Stern said.
 The decline in financial revenue slowed to 11.6 percent
like-for-like in the quarter from 25.3 percent in the first
half, helped by higher interest rates and by rising employment
in Brazil.
Edenred now expects to limit the decline in financial
revenue to 10 percent in the second half, compared with a
previous forecast of a 10-20 percent fall.
 Closely watched issue volume -- the face value of its
vouchers and the amount put on its prepaid cards -- rose 13.7
percent like-for-like in the third quarter, which was an
acceleration from 7.8 percent growth in the first half.
 This was also in line with Edenred's goal of achieving
annual organic growth of 6 to 14 percent in issue volume.
 Edenred said it now aimed for earnings before interest and
tax (EBIT) of between 310 million and 330 million euros versus
its previous target of 300 million to 330 million euros.
 French sovereign investment fund FSI, which had opposed the
split as too risky amid volatile markets, sold its entire 6.8
percent stake in Edenred this month.
 Edenred shares closed down 0.9 percent at 15.03 euros,
giving it a market value of 3.4 billion euros.

1603,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2010 01:16PM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Changes to EU budget rules agreed by finance ministers," LUXEMBOURG, Oct 19 (Reuters) - European Union finance
ministers agreed on changes to EU budget rules on Monday in the
hope of regaining market trust and preventing another sovereign
debt crisis like the one triggered by Greece.
 The agreement on the new rules has to be approved by EU
leaders on Oct. 28-29 and fleshed out with further details in
November, before being reviewed by the European Parliament.
 The European Commission, the EU's executive, hopes to have
the new rules in place in mid-2011, but the chairman of euro
zone finance ministers, Jean-Claude Juncker, expects they will
only be operational from 2012.
 Below are the key elements of the agreement to update and
change the EU's Stability and Growth Pact.
 
 WHO WILL BE AFFECTED?
 The tougher rules will apply only to euro zone countries,
but all 27 EU member states will also develop over the next 2-3
years ways of penalising budget ill-discipline among non-euro
zone members, with the exception of Britain.
 The sanctions for countries outside the euro zone would be
linked to suspension of pay-outs of EU funds to member states
and should take shape in time for the next multi-annual EU
budget framework that will start in 2014.
 
 HOW MUCH WILL IT HURT? 
 The ministers did not agree on Monday on any numbers for
fines or deposits, rates of decline or any other numerical
values that could be used as a means to enforce the rules. Such
details will be agreed on after EU leaders give their approval
to the framework agreement.
 However, the European Commission has proposed that interest
bearing deposits, non-interest bearing deposits and fines for
excessive deficits and debt should be 0.2 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP) and 0.1 percent of GDP as a penalty for
allowing macroeconomic imbalances to develop. These numbers are
likely to be adopted later, sources said.
 
 BEFORE TROUBLE STARTS 
 The Commission will monitor the economies of the 27 EU
countries using a scoreboard of indicators with alert thresholds
that vary for euro zone and non-euro zone countries. The list of
indicators used by the Commission will be endorsed by EU finance
ministers and updated.
 This analysis may lead euro zone finance ministers to
declare a euro zone economy to have ""excessive imbalances"" and
to recommend action to be taken by a deadline.
 The policy recommendations could address fiscal, wage and
macro-structural as well as macro-prudential policy areas.
 If a country repeatedly -- twice or more -- ignores the
recommendations, it should face sanctions. 
 
 TROUBLE BEGINS
 Under the current rules, a euro zone country can be fined
for repeatedly running a deficit higher than 3 percent of GDP
and repeatedly ignoring EU finance ministers' recommendations to
bring it down below that level. This could take years and has
never happened yet.
 There is also no enforcement mechanism to make countries
move towards a budget close to balance or in surplus, which is
the agreed medium term objective of all EU countries. The rules
say countries should cut their budget deficits by at least 0.5
percent of GDP a year in structural terms, again with no
enforcement mechanism.
 Under the new rules, sanctions would begin at once if a
country ""deviates significantly from the adjustment path
foreseen in the Stability and Growth Pact"" even if the deficit
is smaller than 3 percent of GDP. What would constitute a
""significant deviation"" in terms of numbers is to be decided in
coming months.
 
 MORE EMPHASIS ON DEBT
 Until the Greek debt crisis, debt levels in the euro zone
had not attracted much attention. The crisis has changed that.
 - Countries that have debt above the EU limit of 60 percent
of GDP will have to move towards a budget close to balance or in
surplus faster than those with lower debt.
 - If debt does not decline at a satisfactory pace, even a
budget deficit below the EU limit of 3 percent of GDP would not
be enough to stop the EU's disciplinary steps against a country
-- and that involves financial sanctions.
 - In assessing the need for debt reduction, the Commission
will take into account all relevant factors such as low nominal
growth, risk factors linked to the structure of debt, private
sector indebtedness and implicit liabilities related to ageing.
 A numerical value of what is a satisfactory pace will be
decided later, probably over the next two months.
 
 HOW WOULD IT WORK IN PRACTICE?
 - If a country ""deviates significantly"" from its deficit
adjustment path the Commission would issue a warning. The
Commission would recommend what steps it needs to take and when.
Within one month, EU ministers would adopt recommendations and
deadlines for the country on the basis of the Commission's
suggestions with a qualified majority of votes.
 - Five months later, the Commission would assess whether the
country had done as it was asked. EU finance ministers would
either agree or disagree with the Commission through a qualified
majority vote (weighted by population). If they agreed required
policy changes had not been made, the country would have to make
an interest-bearing deposit as a penalty and only a qualified
majority of ministers could stop that.
 - The whole process should not take more than 6 months and
the 5-month period between ministers' recommendations and the
assessment as to whether they had been adhered to could be
shortened to 3 months if the Commission believed the situation
was particularly serious.
 
 THE SCREW IS TIGHTENED ...
 Once the budget deficit became higher than 3 percent of GDP,
the country would be placed in a disciplinary EU procedure,
called the excessive deficit procedure (EDP) and the
interest-bearing deposit from the stage before would stop
accruing interest.
 If there was no interest-bearing deposit from the previous
stage, there would again be a qualified majority vote by the
ministers on recommendations and deadlines from the Commission
and an assessment of whether those were adhered to after 5
months.
 
 AND TIGHTENED ...
 If ministers agreed the country had ignored their
recommendations, the non-interest bearing deposit would be
changed into a fine -- a process only a qualified majority of
ministers could stop.
 If the country continued to ignore the recommendations, the
fine could be increased, but this time only if a qualified
majority of ministers backed such a move.
 The deadline for taking effective action can be reduced to 3
months from 6 months if the situation warrants it.
 
 NEW RULES DO NOT APPLY TO THE PAST
 Already 24 out of the EU's 27 members are under the EU's
disciplinary budget rules. The new sanctions, however, would not
apply retroactively and there would be a transition phase for
some elements of these proposals.
 
 NATIONAL FRAMEWORKS
 To standardise national fiscal frameworks, the ministers
agreed that they should all meet a set of minimum requirements
no later than the end of 2013. The minimum requirements would
concern public accounting systems and statistics, numerical
rules, forecasting systems, effective medium-term budgetary
frameworks and adequate coverage of general government finances.
 SANCTIONS FOR BAD STATISTICS
 Sanctions could also be considered for countries which
repeatedly failed to get their statistics validated by the
European Statistics office Eurostat.

 NEW YORK, Oct 19 (Reuters) - World stocks and commodity
prices fell on Tuesday after China, the engine of growth in an
anemic global recovery, raised interest rates for the first
time since 2007 to rein in its booming economy.
 The dollar gained and Wall Street slumped on China's
unexpected 25-basis-point rate increase a day after U.S
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner vowed Washington would not
devalue the currency for its own advantage. For details see:
[ID:nTOE69I048]
 Oil prices fell, copper slid and gold was poised for its
largest one-day drop since early July, while the dollar rose
against the euro, the Japanese yen and a basket of major
currencies following the rate hike by the People's Bank of
China.
 The central bank of China said it would raise its benchmark
one-year lending and deposit rate, effective on Wednesday, in a
tightening that analysts said may suggest Beijing and
Washington are working together to ease rising currency
tensions. The announcement from China's central bank was made
on Oct. 19, which is remembered on Wall Street as the
anniversary of the 1987 stock market crash.
 Traders cut their exposure to risk by taking refuge in the
dollar and selling the euro and commodity-sensitive Australian
dollar. [ID:nN19134544]
 The Australian dollar, which last week rose above parity
with the U.S. currency for the first time since 1983, was hit
hardest, slipping 1.5 percent. The euro and sterling also fell
sharply.
 Investors feared a quarter-percentage point rise in China's
one-year lending rate could dampen Chinese and global growth
while slowing China's voracious demand for commodities, many of
which come from Australia. [ID:nBJI002412]
 ""China's rate increase instantaneously pushed people to
take risk off the table,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of
research at GFT Forex.
 China ""is trying to clamp down on growth and that's going
to reflect badly on Australia, on Germany, on much of the world
economy as it readjusts to the idea that Chinese growth may not
be as torrid as expected,"" Schlossberg said.
 The dollar was up against a basket of major currencies,
with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 1.26 percent at 77.903.
 LIQUIDITY 'TUG OF WAR'
 European shares and Wall Street fell as disappointed
investors worried about the strength of U.S. corporate earnings
after results and outlooks from consumer and technology titans
Apple and IBM failed to meet expectations.
 The MSCI all-country world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS>
fell 1.1 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3>
index of top shares slipped 0.5 percent to end at 1,082.96.
 At 12:50 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
down 107.40 points, or 0.96 percent, at 11,036.29. The Standard
& Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was down 10.32 points, or 0.87
percent, at 1,174.39. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was
down 24.39 points, or 0.98 percent, at 2,456.27.
 China's interest-rate decision unsettled investors, said
Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global
Markets in Brussels. Investors had become accustomed to
widespread expectations of further U.S. monetary expansions,
 ""It is now a tug of war between China taking liquidity out
of the market and the Federal Reserve putting liquidity back in
possibly through quantitative easing,"" he said. ""It is
difficult to predict whether this is the start of a market
reversal.""
 Apple's  shares, which hit a lifetime high on
Monday, fell 2 percent to $311.70 and tripped up the Nasdaq.
[ID:nN18288374]
 International Business Machines Corp  said it won
fewer technology services deals than expected in the third
quarter, sending its shares down 3.2 percent to $138.23.[ID:nN18152165].
 GOLD PLUMMETS, OIL DROPS
 The basic materials sector <.GSPM>, closely linked to
consumption in China, was the worst performer in the S&P 500
and helped push European shares edged lower. [ID:nLDE69I1CS]
 Oil fell on the dollar's strength. U.S. light sweet crude
oil  was off $2.30 to $80.78 a barrel.
 Spot gold prices  lost $24.55 to $1,343.70 an ounce.
 U.S. government debt prices were little changed as several
Federal Reserve officials expressed the need for more policy
easing, which offset solid bank results and less grim housing
data. [ID:nN19130537]
 Traders interpreted remarks from several senior Fed
officials as reassurance that the U.S. central bank will
shortly engage in a second round of asset purchases known as
quantitative easing, dubbed ""QE2.""
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
3/32 in price to yield 2.50 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury
note  was break-even, yielding 0.37 percent.
 Overnight in Asia, Japan's Nikkei share average closed 0.4
percent higher <.N225>, extending a gain since September to 6.9
percent, but MSCI's index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> slipped 0.3 percent.
 The China rate hike move came after Asian markets had
closed. The dollar  was up 0.42 percent at 81.57 against
the yen.

 ZURICH, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The strength of the Swiss franc
represents a danger for the Swiss economy, Aymo Brunetti, chief
economist at the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO)
was quoted as saying on Tuesday.
 ""On the whole, exports have been less dynamic recently and

 * Government may consider budget cuts and tax hikes
 
 By Jon Herskovitz
 JOHANNESBURG, Oct 19 (Reuters) - South African public sector
unions representing about 1.3 million workers have accepted a
government wage hike offer, bringing a formal end to a strike
that shut school and caused chaos in hospitals, officials said.
 ""We have a deal. The unions that will sign from today
constitute a majority,"" Chris Klopper, a spokesman for the
Independent Labour Caucus federation, told Reuters on Tuesday.
 The government offered the workers a raise of 7.5 percent,
about double the inflation rate, and 800 rand ($115.70) a month
for housing. Unions were seeking 8 percent and 1,000 rand.
 The three-week strike through most of August cost the
economy an estimated $150 million a day, damaged support for the
president and led to millions of days of lost work at government
offices, schools and hospitals. 
 It was suspended in early September with workers returning
to their jobs. 
 The agreement relieves pressure on President Jacob Zuma and
his ruling African National Congress by easing friction with the
country's largest labour federation COSATU, which took part in
the strike and is in a governing alliance with the ANC.
 The deal will probably swell state spending by between 1 and
2 percent of the budget, putting pressure on the government to
consider tax increases and budget cuts elsewhere.
 The housing allowance will cost about twice as much as the
government spends on environmental protection and is much more
than a new plan to expand antiretroviral therapy in the country
with one of the world's highest infection rates of HIV/AIDS. 
 The wage deal will be applied retroactively from July, union
officials said. The government needed at least 50 percent of the
unions representing striking workers to agree to the deal for it
to go into effect.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Oct 19 (Reuters) - A surprise interest rate
increase from China on Tuesday rattled investors who cut risk
exposure by selling the euro and commodity-sensitive Australian
dollar and taking refuge in the U.S. currency.
 Investors feared a quarter percentage point rise in China's
one-year lending rate could dampen Chinese and global growth
and slow the country's voracious demand for commodities, many
of which come from Australia.
 ""China's rate increase instantaneously pushed people to
take risk off the table,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of
research at GFT Forex. ""(China) is trying to clamp down on
growth and that's going to reflect badly on Australia, on
Germany, on much of the world economy as it readjusts to the
idea that Chinese growth may not be as torrid as expected.""
 The Australian dollar, which last week rose above parity
with its U.S. counterpart for the first time since 1983, was
hit hardest, slipping 1.5 percent to $0.9752.
 The euro and sterling also fell sharply, with the former
down 1 percent at $1.3811, off a $1.4003 session peak. Support
around $1.3770 has held so far, though traders said a break of
that level could target $1.37.
 ""The dollar is finding some support here after China's rate
hike triggered a bout of risk aversion, but the euro above
$1.40 was overbought, so the rebound is no real surprise,"" said
John Doyle, strategist at Tempus Consulting in Washington.
 The dollar rose 0.5 percent to 81.65 yen, its best daily
gain since Japan intervened to weaken the yen on Sept. 15. It
hit a 15-year low beneath 81 yen last week. The Australian
dollar/yen exchange rate, an important barometer of risk
sentiment, fell 1 percent to 79.52 yen.
 The U.S. currency also rose 1.3 percent to 1.0305 Canadian
dollars after the Bank of Canada left interest rates at 1
percent and cut is growth forecast.
 DOLLAR STILL VULNERABLE TO SELLING
 Hobbled by zero interest rates and expectations of more
Federal Reserve easing to come, the dollar has been under
pressure since September. Analysts, however, say the
expectations of Federal Reserve easing have been priced in,
providing an opportunity for investors to take profits.
 The dollar's rebound began after the euro rose above $1.41
last week, an 8-1/2-month high. It continued on Monday after
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Washington would not
devalue the dollar for export advantage.
 Analysts said Geithner's comments may mean the United
States was trying to ease global tensions over exchange rates
ahead of a G20 meeting in November. Washington wants China to
allow more rapid appreciation of the yuan. Beijing and others
complain that dollar weakness is stoking inflation by pushing
money into their faster-growing economies.
 A survey showing German economic sentiment wilted this
month also contributed to dollar gains on Tuesday. However,
few see the dollar staging an extended rally. The Fed is
expected to pump more money into an increasingly sluggish U.S.
economy as soon as November, a policy that is ""generally

strategist Michael Woolfolk.
 New York Fed President William Dudley said Tuesday that
employment and inflation are likely several years away from
being within the Fed's comfort zone.
 High-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar and
Brazilian real are also likely to attract buyers following a
recent retreat, said Societe General strategist Kit Juckes.

1610,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2010 12:04PM ET</span>",Out with the abacus in China's 25-bp rate rise," BEIJING, Oct 19 (Reuters) - China shook global markets on
Tuesday with its unexpected increase of interest rates, but the
surprise was compounded for careful observers by the size of
the move.
 The increase was 25 basis points, the first time in modern
history that Beijing adjusted deposit and lending levels by a
number that was not a multiple of nine. In the past, the
central bank typically raised rates by 27 basis points.
 ""The reason is that on the abacus, adding multiples of nine
was much easier than adding multiples of 10. So the modern
People's Bank of China inherited that special character from
the old days,"" Ken Peng, an economist with Citigroup in
Beijing, said.
 ""But clearly, computers and market participants may prefer
rounder numbers,"" he said.
 The central bank raised deposit rates at virtually every
tenor by unusual amounts to leave lenders with nice, round
numbers.
 For example, the two-year lending rate was raised by 46
basis points to 3.25 percent, while the six-month rate was
increased by 22 basis points to 2.2 percent.
 ""This reflects a changing method of calculating interest
rates by commercial banks,"" said Gao Shanwen, chief economist
at Essence Securities in Beijing. ""It will give more
flexibility to commercial banks.""
 Making rates divisible by five puts China in line with
global standards, but those with a sense of history will regret
what is being lost.
 Joseph Yam captured the feeling of nostalgia when he was
chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
 ""Although abacuses are not commonly used these days, the
tradition lives on,"" he wrote in 2006 in an explanation of why
rates were divisible by nine. ""It is also another small
challenge for those wishing to understand finance in China.""

 * Says G20 must coordinate policy to rebalance world economy
 
 By Daniel Flynn
 LUXEMBOURG, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The European Union's monetary
affairs chief called on G20 governments on Tuesday to take
coordinated steps to rebalance world economic growth, ahead of
their talks this week in South Korea.
 EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said
imbalances that destabilised the world economy before the 2008-
2009 financial crisis were emerging again, with exporting
nations running excessive trade surpluses while others racked up
unsustainable deficits.
 Rehn said economic recovery in the United States, where
jobless rates have remained stubbornly high and consumers
cautious about spending, ""appears to be running out of steam"".
While unemployment had fallen in most of Europe, a rebound in
the region's economy was still ""in progress"", he said.
 ""In the world economy...the pre-crisis imbalances are
emerging, which threaten sustained recovery and job-creation,""
Rehn told a news conference after talks between European finance
ministers in Luxembourg.
 ""It's essential that the G20...will be able to restore a
sense of unity and especially pursue effective international
policy coordination to rebalance global growth,"" he said.
 The Commissioner will travel to South Korea this week for
Oct. 22-23 talks between G20 finance ministers expected to focus
on reform of the IMF, new rules for international banking
regulation and global currencies.
 In recent weeks, the EU has closed ranks with Washington in
accusing China -- set to become the world's second largest
economy this year -- of keeping the yuan  low to boost
exports, undermining jobs and growth in Western economies.
 
 ALL COUNTRIES MUST DO MORE
 With the euro topping $1.40 in recent days, its highest
level since January, European officials have increasingly
expressed concern that the currency could act as a counterweight
in a tug-of-war between the yuan and the dollar.
 However, China's central bank jolted markets on Tuesday with
a surprise first rise in interest rates in nearly three years,
upping benchmark rates by 25 basis points, reflecting its
concern about rising asset prices and inflation. [ID:nSGE69I0HU]
 Analysts said the move might suggest a deal between
Washington and Beijing on easing exchange tensions after
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner vowed the United States
would not devalue the dollar for its own advantage.
[ID:nTOE69I048]
 Washington has also delayed a decision on whether to label
China a currency manipulator until after a summit of G20 leaders
in November in Seoul.
 Rehn, who has repeatedly called for China to revalue the
yuan more quickly, struck a measured tone on Tuesday.
 ""All countries should do their part to rebalance global
growth. The surplus countries by reinforcing domestic demand and
the deficit countries by prioritising...export growth,"" he said.
 The United States would like to see the G20 serve as a more
open forum for discussion of global currencies -- an aim shared
by France, which takes over the presidency of the group after
the November heads of state and government meeting.
 French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said G20 issues
were not discussed in depth on Tuesday.
 European ministers, however, expressed satisfaction they
clinched a hard-fought deal on hedge fund regulation ahead of
the G20 talks this week, allowing them to present a united
stance. [ID:nLDE69I1QN]

 * U.S. monetary stimulus eyed
 
 (Updates with closing prices)
 ANKARA, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Turkey's markets eased slightly
on Tuesday on concerns that the rally in asset prices driven by
monetary loosening in the United States might have reached
excessive levels.
 High growth and continued political stability at home have
brought Turkish asset prices towards record highs, but the main
driver has been the expectation of more cheap money flowing into
higher-yielding emerging markets.
 The lira ended weaker at 1.4240 against the dollar versus
the previous day's 1.4190 on the interbank market. The currency
hit 1.3920 against the dollar last week, its strongest in two
years.
 ""The market is reacting on the assumption that the rally has
somewhat overshot,"" said Yagiz Oral, a dealer in Denizbank.
 The sales gained pace after the Chinese central bank raised
its benchmark interest rates by 25 basis points in an unexpected
move, propping up the dollar against other major currencies.
 Turkish stocks hit successive historic highs this month and
bond yields approached their historic lows.
 Analysts said expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve
would further ease monetary policy next month moved the Turkish
markets, but there is uncertainty over the amount.
 ""Some market players have questions in their minds on the
amount of the easing but this is of secondary importance ... The
FOMC members won't hesitate to use their power to produce
monetary stimulus,"" said AK Portfoy fixed-income portfolio
manager Eralp Denktas.
 The main Istanbul share index fell 0.88 percent to 69,838.75
points, ceding some gains after a rally of some 4.3 percent last
week, when the index rose to record highs on three consecutive
days and broke 70,000 points.
 The yield on the benchmark April 25, 2012 bond was 7.68
percent, down from the previous day's 7.72 percent. The
benchmark bond touched an all-time low in October 2009 at 7.59
percent.

 * Demand from private pension funds seen dropping next year
 
 (Adds more detail)
 BUDAPEST, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Hungary can safely finance its
debt and deficit in 2011 despite planning to cut the revenues of
private pension funds, which have been key domestic buyers of
government debt, a top debt agency official said on Tuesday.
 The government announced a plan last week to channel new
savings in private sector funds worth around 420 billion forints
($2.11 billion) in the next 14 months into the state pension
system, which pension funds dubbed as ""covert nationalisation"".
 Debt agency AKK's deputy CEO, Andras Laszlo Borbely, said
increased demand from foreign investors and an expected rise in
household savings could counterbalance the measure's impact.
 ""If they (private pension funds) do not buy, others can step
into their place, and we can mainly think of foreign investors,""
he told Reuters.
 A planned cut in personal income taxes worth an estimated
300 billion forints next year could also create additional
demand for government debt, Borbely added.
 ""Part of that (tax cuts) will become savings and directly or
indirectly that could also appear in the government debt market
as demand,"" he said.
 The Economy Ministry said a month ago in a preliminary
financing plan for 2011 that the government planned to finance
its budget deficit from forint debt markets next year to reduce
reliance on foreign currency financing. [ID:nLDE68D24G]
 That plan included net forint-denominated government bond
and Treasury bill issues worth 677 billion forints, assuming
that the budget deficit will be 3 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP) next year.
 Borbely said demand from foreign investors has increased in
the past months and by the end of October they are expected to
increase their share in this year's net Hungarian debt issuance
to 60 percent from about 40 percent in September.
 ""If this interest remains next year, financing (from
forint-denominated issuance) can cause no problem,"" he said.
 Hungarian private pension funds have kept slightly more than
half of their assets in Hungarian government debt.
 Fixed income traders have said that the expected drop in
demand from private pension funds may put upwards pressure on
Hungarian forint debt yields.
 Borbely said the 2011 budget will unveil whether the
government plans to assume debt from state-owned companies.
 Heavily indebted state firms include railway firm MAV or
Budapest transport firm BKV.
 If part of the currently targeted below 3 percent deficit
stems from such debt assumptions, the government's financing
need next year can be lower than now expected -- as debts
assumed by the state must be financed only in the year when they
expire, he said.
 The government is expected to discuss the draft 2011 budget
later this month.

 * Hryvnia under pressure from cash market - analyst
 * C.bank comfortable with slow depreciation
(Adds c.bank intervention volume)
 KIEV, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The Ukrainian hryvnia 
extended losses on Tuesday, hitting a fresh six-month low
against the dollar and prompting the central bank to intervene
by selling about $100 million on the market.
 The hryvnia hit 7.953 against the dollar at 1120 GMT, its
lowest level since early April and compared with 7.950 at the
previous day's close.
 The central bank then offered to sell dollars at 7.9440
 and sold ""about $100 million"", a source at the central
bank told Reuters.
 The Ukrainian currency has been weakening since early
September after the country's current account deficit surged to
$563 million, its highest this year, and after central bank
First Deputy Chairman Anatoly Shapovalov, who was closely
involved in exchange rate policy, resigned on Sept. 1 and was
replaced by Serhiy Arbuzov, seen as a close ally of President
Viktor Yanukovich.
 Some analysts say the hryvnia's decline -- still relatively
small compared with gains made since presidential elections in
January -- goes against fundamentals as the country's balance of
payments, supported by metals exports, remains healthy.
 U.S. economist Nouriel Roubini told a conference in Kiev on
Tuesday that, overall, the hryvnia ""remains slightly
undervalued"", adding that ""appreciation could actually help with
reducing inflation"" which more than doubled to 2.9 pct in
September.
 Some analysts say the currency's gradual depreciation is
being driven by speculative buying of dollars.
 ""The hryvnia remains under pressure from the cash market, as
companies and households have been showing interest in buying
dollars since August,"" said a dealer at a Western bank in Kiev.
 ""The central bank is not in a rush to slow down the process,
assuming that a weaker hryvnia will have a positive effect on
the economy.""
 A number of emerging market economies are managing exchange
rates to avoid fast appreciation against the weakening dollar
and maintain economic competitiveness.
 The dealer also said that Ukraine's central bank avoided
heavy intervention as that would prompt dollar holders to
postpone converting the greenback into the hryvnia as they
expected a more favourable exchange rate in the future.
 Another local dealer said foreign investors could be selling
Ukrainian treasury bills to take profits.
 ""The yields of T-bills are about to bottom out,"" he said.
 Ukraine's T-bills maturing on Nov. 23, 2011 
yielded 9.05 percent on Tuesday as their price rose 0.15 percent
from the previous day's close on the PFTS exchange.
 Ukraine's central bank said this week the net influx of
foreign currency into the country had exceeded $5 billion so far
this year. But it said the flow of foreign currency remained
volatile as it was dominated by export revenues and loans.

1617,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2010 10:52AM ET</span>",Biosimilar threat tarnishes Novo's star status," * Pfizer deal with Biocon spooks Novo investors
 * Increased threat of cheap competition in insulin market
 * But hurdles remain, including developing delivery devices
 * Shares down around 10 percent in less than two days
 
 By Anna Ringstrom and Ben Hirschler
 COPENHAGEN/LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Fears of cut-price
competition in the insulin market sent shares in Novo Nordisk
skidding again on Tuesday, lopping some 10 percent off the
Danish drugmaker's market value in less than two days.
 The threat from so-called biosimilar insulins has been
crystallised by Pfizer's agreement to sell versions of insulin
developed by India's Biocon.
 Piper Jaffray senior analyst Sam Fazeli said the news was a
sudden reminder of the likelihood of generic insulin competition
in a few years' time and shares in Novo -- the European drug
sector's star performer this year -- could drop even more.
 ""The real risk from generic insulin is far out, but Novo's
valuation was so high it was vulnerable,"" he said.
 ""They are taking a hit because they are the most expensive
pharma company in the world. In order to have that kind of
valuation, you need to have a business that is bullet-proof.""
 Fazeli, who has a neutral stance on Novo's shares with a
price target of 495 crowns, added that if Biocon had made a deal
with any drugmaker other than the world's biggest ""maybe people
wouldn't have been so worried"".
 The Danish drugmaker, the world's biggest supplier of
insulin, has been on a roll since mid-2009 on hopes for its new
diabetes drug Victoza and confidence in its insulin franchise.
 Expanding waistlines globally have fuelled an epidemic of
type-2 diabetes that has boosted demand for its products.
 
 PFIZER AMBITIONS
 The looming challenge from Pfizer is a blow but arguably no
great surprise, given the U.S. company's stated ambitions to
become a major player in biopharmaceuticals.
 Novo spokesman Mike Rulis said his company expected generic
competition after patents for its modern insulins expired.
 ""Nothing in this has changed the playing field. We believe
both our existing products and, not the least, our upcoming new
products will remain very competitive,"" he said.
 Biosimilars -- copies of complex biotech drugs that are
comparable, though not identical, to the original product -- are
also a long-term threat for other companies making biological
medicines, like Roche and Amgen.
 Sanford Bernstein analyst Jack Scannell said that with
biosimilar insulins still at the development stage, their
success was not guaranteed -- but he noted that the deal between
Pfizer and Biocon was the first of its kind.
 ""Pfizer said they may be ready for launch in Europe in 2012,
and possibly 2015 in the U.S., but Novo sales could be affected
in developing markets where Biocon already sells biosimilar
drugs in the relatively near term,"" Scannell said.
 ""But I do think it will be tough commercially, and a long
and hard battle to really take on Novo in its major markets.""
 Some investors have decided to cash in face of the Pfizer
threat. Novo shares shed 4.2 percent to 489.70 crowns at 1445
GMT, after a 5.1 percent tumble on Monday, while the STOXX 600
European healthcare index fell 1 percent.
 Novo remains very expensive, trading at around 21 times
expected 2010 earnings based on consensus forecasts, or roughly
double the European pharmaceuticals sector average.
 
 DELIVERY DEVICE
 One key hurdle that any biosimilar manufacturer will have to
overcome is making a competitive delivery device. Novo's pen
injection systems have proved popular with patients and may be
hard to replace.
 Deutsche Bank analyst Tim Race said the Pfizer/Biocon deal
was unlikely to impact earnings between 2010 and 2014 and the
shares should stabilise.
 But they may remain weak ahead of an Oct. 22 U.S. regulatory
decision on Eli Lilly and Amylin's experimental diabetes drug
Bydureon, a rival to Novo's Victoza, he added.

 ABIDJAN, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Ivory Coast's Cocoa authority
said on Tuesday that exporters who sell damp or mouldy cocoa
risk having their licenses revoked and that quality control
centres will prevent such exports from next month.
 The West African nation is the world's top cocoa grower,
meeting about 40 percent of global demand. But it has long
struggled with the issue of the quality of its beans.
 ""From the first of November, all cocoa that does not respect
the norms of quality in the state of Ivory Coast will be
rejected,"" Gilbert Ano, president of the main cocoa regulating
body and head of the Coffee and Cocoa Bourse (BCC), told
exporters and middlemen at the BCC office in Abidjan.
 ""All those who contravene these regulations will be simply
and purely sanctioned by having their licenses removed.""
 Ano said that any cocoa that is found to have humidity
higher than 10 percent and mould of more than 5 percent would
not be accepted for export between Nov. 1 and Nov. 15. After
Nov. 15, he said the standard would rise to 8 percent humidity
and 4 percent mould.
 ""We will control the quality in every outlet in Abidjan, San
Pedro and all towns,"" he said.
 Ivory Coast is battling diseases such as black pod, which is
caused by wet weather.
 Its cocoa is considered low grade when compared with the
beans from neighbour and competitor Ghana, whose cocoa is much
sought after by the top chocolate makers.

 * Expect volatility in days ahead on the big surprise
 
 By Lu Jianxin and Eric Burroughs
 SHANGHAI/HONG KONG, Oct 19 (Reuters) - China's surprise rate
hike could drive down Shanghai stocks more than 3 percent on
Wednesday, but the yuan's rise may be halted to prevent an
influx of foreign funds from heading into the country.
 The People's Bank of China surprised investors by lifting
benchmark deposit and lending rates by 25 basis points each, a
move that had not been expected until 2011 and sparked a broad
drop in risky asset across the world.
 The move, taking one-year deposit rates to 2.5 percent and
one-year lending rates to 5.56 percent, suggests the government
is not happy with the recent run-up in asset prices, including a
15 percent jump in the Shanghai Composite in just eight trading
days and a rebound in property prices despite repeated steps to
cool the red-hot real estate sector.
 The PBOC may also be worried about hot money coming into the
country as the Federal Reserve is expected to follow the Bank of
Japan in boosting quantitative easing measures.
 * China's benchmark Shanghai Composite could fall 3 percent
or more as investors turn nervous about quicker-than-expected of
monetary policy and take profits on the sharp jump this month.
 * The rate hike, plus clear signs that China's inflation is
picking up to its fastest in two years, will keep investors
nervous that China is entering a stretch of high inflation that
has historically been bad for domestic stocks.
 * Property shares, which have contributed to the Shanghai
Composite being a laggard among global stock markets this week,
will again be hit hard as the rate hike increases their
borrowing costs from banks. The Shanghai Composite property
sub-sector is still down 17 percent on the year compared with
8.4 percent for the overall index.
 * The hike also suggests that Beijing may choose to stop the
yuan's recent appreciation after the Chinese currency has risen
2.5 percent since early September, its biggest pace of gain
since the yuan's landmark revaluation in July 2005.
 * Spot yuan is likely to move around 6.65 against the dollar
and could move around that level for some time as the PBOC tries
to stamp out expectations for more yuan appreciation and ward
off funds lured by China's higher rates.
 * The government, which had been expected to allow the yuan
climb to near 6.60 to the dollar by mid-November in response to
U.S. pressure, may bluntly stop yuan appreciation.
 * While China's capital controls in theory prevent money
from coming into its domestic markets, that cash tends to find a
way in. Anecdotal evidence has suggested a return of hot money
inflows, such as turnover on the Shanghai Composite hitting a
record high on Monday.
 * Chinese government bond yields will rise across the curve,
with medium- and long-term yields having the potential to jump
10 basis points on worries that the PBOC is embarking on a
series of rate hikes in coming months.
 * The seven-day bond repurchase rate, China's money market
benchmark, should reverse a drop due to excess liquidity in the
system. The seven-day repo rate should snap back above 2 percent
versus Tuesday's close of 1.91 percent.
 * That compares with the new one-year deposit rate of 2.5
percent and the one-year lending rate of 5.56 percent.

 * Germany secures support for review of EU treaties
 * Dismay at rules being decided by Paris, Berlin
 
 By Jan Strupczewski
 LUXEMBOURG, Oct 19 (Reuters) - A last-minute Franco-German
deal has watered down changes to European Union budget rules and
means politicians may ultimately be able to prevent sanctions
being imposed.
 Germany had until Monday led a group of EU countries keen to
see near-automatic penalties imposed on those breaking EU budget
rules -- a move to prevent another Greek-style debt crisis.
 But a deal struck between French President Nicolas Sarkozy
and German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a summit in Deauville,
France, trumped discussions among EU finance ministers in
Luxembourg over the rules and means the new regime is likely to
be softer than it might otherwise have been, euro zone sources
said.
 The big question is whether France and Germany have now
compromised the credibility of the reworked budget rules, or
whether there will be sufficient rigidity in the new system to
prevent future crises and keep budget breakers in check.
 That question will not be answered until the rules have to
be enforced but EU finance ministers expressed reservations
about whether the deal they ended up with was as strong as it
could have been, and EU sources were concerned about a watering
down.
 ""I'm a little bit surprised that we did not have the full
100 percent backing for fiscal discipline from Germany. We could
have reached a little bit further,"" Swedish Finance Minister
Anders Borg told reporters on Tuesday.
 A senior euro zone source present during the talks was less
diplomatic. ""It was appalling -- the Germans were like a poodle
of the French, they even prevented the smaller countries from
having a go at France,"" the source said.
 Publically, most finance ministers said they were pleased to
have reached a deal, which will involve more immediate measures
being taken against countries whose budget deficits exceed EU
limits and who are not doing enough to bring the shortfall down.
 But under the Franco-German deal, Paris has secured extra
steps in the sanctions process which will give countries more
political oversight and which could potentially stall the
process, making it barely more strict than the current system.
 Ministerial agreement to move forward with sanctions could
now be stopped by a blocking minority, a lower threshold than
originally proposed by the European Commission.
 That would make it easier for large countries with bigger
voting power, such as France or Germany, to do so than for
smaller ones, raising the issue of equal treatment of euro zone
members.
 ""There is agreement that only a majority of ministers can
stop sanctions from being applied, but the problem is that the
introduced changes mean we may never get to the stage where such
a vote on sanctions would take place,"" one euro zone source
said.
 In exchange for supporting France, euro zone sources said
Berlin had likely secured French support for changes to the EU
treaty to be able to suspend the voting rights of euro zone
countries that are in serious breach of euro zone rules and the
creation of a permanent mechanism for crisis resolution.
 But changes to the main EU law have to be ratified by all 27
EU member states to enter into force and are tough to enact.
 ""It is hard to imagine Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain or
Ireland agreeing to have voting rights suspended for countries
that are in serious breach of EU budget rules,"" the first source
said, referring to countries that already are in serious
budgetary difficulties and well above EU limits.
 
 MUDDIED PROCESS
 One source attending the discussions decried what he saw as
political meddling in a process that must be above politics if
it is to seen as tough and unimpeachable by financial markets.
 ""Give politicians a crack in the rules and they will drive a
truck through it,"" he said.
 At the same time, the sources said the rule changes went
broadly in the right direction and would result in a tougher set
of sanctions than currently exist.
 Monday's finance ministers' meeting put the finishing
touches to a broad overhaul of the 27-nation bloc's fiscal
rulebook, with focus on the 16 countries sharing the euro.
 EU budget rules say that countries should seek a budget
close to balance or in surplus by cutting their deficit by at
least 0.5 percent of GDP a year, and must not have a deficit
above 3 percent of GDP and debt above 60 percent of GDP.
 Under the agreed new rules, the European Commission would
issue a warning to a country that did not move towards a budget
close to balance or in surplus. 
 But then, instead of waiting six months and moving directly
to sanctions if the country ignored the warning, France pushed
for and got the two extra voting stages.
 Because sanctions, in the form of interest-bearing deposits,
non-interest bearing deposits and finally fines, would gradually
grow tougher only if there was agreement a country did not
comply with the first set of recommendations, blocking the first
decision could, in effect, stop the whole sanctions process.
 ""In an extreme case, this means that things could stay
exactly the way they are now -- for example France could muster
a blocking minority that would torpedo an agreement that Paris
has not complied and then France could even see its deficit rise
above 3 percent of GDP and sanctions would still not apply,"" the
euro zone source said, referring to the budget deficit limit.

 By Erik Kirschbaum
 BERLIN, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's
criticism that multiculturalism has failed in Germany sparked a
government row on Tuesday over whether the country should take
in more skilled immigrants that industry says it needs urgently.
 Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere dismissed calls from
three other cabinet ministers who had argued that Germany should
relax its rules on immigrants because the country is facing a
worsening shortage of skilled labour as its population shrinks.
 ""Everyone comes up with proposals without understanding the
situation -- the existing laws are flexible enough,"" said de
Maiziere, a leading conservative voice in Merkel's Christian
Democrats (CDU), referring to demands from other ministers.
 ""Employers who need skilled workers should go out in the
world and recruit them -- and then we'll help them with the
immigration. The other way around won't work.""
 The row comes at an awkward time for German head of state
Christian Wulff, on a five-day state visit to Turkey. Wulff, the
first German president to visit Turkey in a decade, has urged
his country to accept Muslims as an integral part of society.
 There are about four million Muslims in Germany, a country
of 82 million. Most of the Muslims are from Turkey.
 Wulff's comments added further fuel to a national debate
about immigration and integration that has been raging since a
former central banker, Thilo Sarrazin, published a book taking a
critical look at Turkish and Arabic immigrants.
 Sarrazin was at first condemned for stirring racism but,
after opinion polls showed an overwhelming majority of Germans
backed his views, some conservative leaders in Merkel's
Christian Democrats began taking a harder line on immigration.
 Merkel long tried to accommodate both sides of the debate,
talking tough on integration but also telling Germans that they
must accept mosques have become part of their landscape. After
her support plunged, Merkel appeared to shift to the right.
 ""This (multicultural) approach has failed, utterly failed,""
Merkel told a party rally at the weekend.
 
 SKILLS SHORTAGE
 The opposition Social Democrats, Greens and the Left party
have all criticised conservatives who have spoken out against
immigration, an issue which has led to a split within the ruling
coalition.
 Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle, a leader of the Free
Democrats coalition partners, along with CDU ministers Ursula
von der Leyen (Labour) and Annette Schavan (Education), have
spoken out in favour of relaxing rules for foreign workers.
 The German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) says
Germany lacks about 400,000 skilled workers.
 Bruederle said Germany should introduce a points-based
system of immigration that would allow skilled workers into the
country to alleviate the shortage. Von der Leyen has raised the
idea of lowering barriers to entry for some foreign workers.
 Schavan said Germany could tap a pool of 300,000 foreigners
-- who are unable to practise their professions because their
credentials are not recognised -- by relaxing those rules.
 ""It's time to show that Germany is an attractive country
(for immigrants),"" she told the Foreign Press Association (VAP).
""There's a lot of change going on right now. I'd urge that we
avoid dissent and work together on our common goals.""
 German industry leaders say the labour shortage is acute.
 ""We urgently need a plan to get the best and the brightest,""
said Anton Boerner, president of the BGA German Foreign Trade
Association. ""Germany needs immigrants, more now than in the
past. Immigration is vital to maintaining our prosperity.""

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Oct 19 (Reuters) - A surprise interest rate
increase from China on Tuesday rattled currency investors, who
cut exposure to risk by selling the euro and
commodity-sensitive Australian dollar and taking refuge in the
U.S. dollar.
 Investors feared a quarter percentage point rise in China's
one-year lending rate could dampen Chinese and global growth
and slow China's voracious demand for commodities, many of
which come from Australia.
 ""China's rate increase instantaneously pushed people to
take risk off the table,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of
research at GFT Forex. ""They are trying to clamp down on growth
and that's going to reflect badly on Australia, on Germany, on
much of the world economy as it readjusts to the idea that
Chinese growth may not be as torrid as expected.""
 The Australian dollar, which last week rose above parity
with its U.S. counterpart for the first time since 1983, was
hit hardest, slipping 1.5 percent to $0.9789.
 The euro, yen and sterling also fell sharply, with the euro
down 0.9 percent at $1.3820, off a $1.4003 session peak. The
dollar rose 0.6 percent to 81.72 yen, its best daily gain since
Japan intervened to weaken the yen on Sept. 15.
 The dollar hit a 15-year low beneath 81 yen last week, not
far from a 79.75 record low set in 1995.
 The U.S. currency also rose 1.7 percent to 1.0350 Canadian
dollars after the Bank of Canada left interest rates at 1
percent and cut is growth forecast.
 DOLLAR REBOUND
 Hobbled by zero interest rates and expectations of more
Federal Reserve easing to come, the dollar has been under
pressure since September. Analysts, however, say the
expectations of Federal Reserve easing have been priced in,
providing an opportunity for investors to take profits.
 China's move accelerated the dollar rebound, as did a
survey showing German economic sentiment fell in October.
 The dollar also got a boost late Monday after Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner said the United States would not
devalue the dollar for export advantage.
 Analysts said Geithner's comments may mean the United
States was trying to ease recent global tensions over exchange
rates ahead of a G20 meeting in November. Washington wants
China to allow more rapid appreciation of the yuan, while
Beijing and others complain that dollar weakness is sending hot
money into their economies and driving up inflation.
 But few expect the dollar to stage an extended rally. The
Fed is expected to move as soon as November to pump more money
into an increasingly sluggish U.S. economy, a policy that is
""generally corrosive to the value of a currency,"" said BNY
Mellon strategist Michael Woolfolk.
 New York Fed President William Dudley said Tuesday that
employment and inflation are likely several years away from
being within the Fed's comfort zone, comments that traders said
suggests that more easing is nearly certain.
 Woolfolk said near-term support for the euro was seen
around 1.3775, the 23.6 percent retracement of a move from
$1.2990 in early September to $1.4157 last week, followed by
$1.3700.
 High-yielding commodity currencies such as the Australian
dollar are also likely to attract buyers following their recent
pullback, said Societe General strategist Kit Juckes.
 He said the market's ""gut reaction is to sell commodity
block and emerging market currencies"" on the China news but
added the news was ""not a game changer.""

 * Some countries see Doha deal in 2011
(Substitutes fresh Lamy comment, adds Doha round, byline)
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The head of the World Trade
Organization stepped into an escalating row over currency
policies on Tuesday, saying growing disputes about exchange
rates could threaten global trade and economic recovery.
 WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy said governments had
largely resisted resorting to conventional trade measures such
as higher tariffs to protect jobs in the wake of the crisis.
 Disorderly currency movements could damage stability in the
trading system, especially if they were seen to be the pursuit
of comparative advantage through exchange rates, he said.
 ""In other words, the hard-won path towards stability and
trade-led recovery could be put in serious jeopardy by
uncooperative currency behaviour,"" Lamy told a meeting of the
WTO's 153 members.
 ""I believe history will judge us harshly if our collective
efforts towards exiting the economic crisis were to be
frustrated by short-sighted individual rent-seeking.""
 Lamy has in the past refused to get involved in discussions
about currencies, arguing that such matters are primarily the
responsibility of the International Monetary Fund -- a view he
repeated on Tuesday -- but the comments indicate his concern.
 Currency tensions are likely to dominate next month's summit
of the G20 developed and emerging economies in Seoul.
 The United States and European Union are calling on China to
let its yuan appreciate, China has condemned lax monetary policy
in the United States for distorting the global economy, Japan
and Switzerland have been selling their currencies to ward off
deflation and emerging economies from Thailand to Brazil are
seeking to block inflationary capital inflows.
 WTO rules do include an article that requires members not to
circumvent trade agreements through exchange rate policy, but
this measure has never been tested in a WTO dispute.
 Lamy declined to comment on the bill passed by the U.S.
House of Representatives that would allow the U.S. government to
treat China's undervalued currency as a subsidy and impose
countervailing duties in response.
 
 WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY
 Lamy also told WTO members he hoped leaders at the G20 would
send a clear political signal that they were ready to enter the
end-game of the Doha round.
 The Doha round was launched in 2001 to free up global
commerce and help poor countries prosper through trade, and the
poorest developing countries are keen to secure its benefits.
 But it has been virtually deadlocked since an abortive
meeting of ministers in July 2008, largely over differences
between the United States and big emerging economies such as
China, India and Brazil over the extent each should open up.
 Lamy said a series of meetings of small groups of
ambassadors in Geneva in recent weeks to brainstorm the issues
had got trading powers engaged again and identified the main
gaps. But they had been less successful in establishing where
governments could be flexible and make trade-offs.
 Ambassadors will hold another round of small-group talks and
then WTO members will assess after the Seoul summit what the
next steps should be.
 Delegates at the meeting expressed broad support for the
approach, as long as all members were kept informed, and several
countries including Japan, Mexico and South Korea said 2011 now
offered a window of opportunity finally to conclude the talks.
 Differences persist over domestic farm subsidies in rich
nations, a safeguard allowing poor countries to raise tariffs to
withstand a destabilising flow of food imports, and calls for
duty-free zones in some industrial sectors.
 But many negotiators believe it now simply requires a
political push from U.S. President Barack Obama, Chinese Premier
Wen Jiabao and other leaders.
 ""What we need is for Mr Obama and Mr Wen to look each other
in the eye and say 'Let's get this done!'. If they do, we can do
it,"" said one diplomat from an industrialised country.

 * Tested Siemens trains similar to those ordered by Eurostar
 * Would challenge Eurostar's monopoly on the Channel Tunnel
 
 By Greg Roumeliotis and Caroline Copley
 LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bahn showcased a Siemens
high-speed train in London on Tuesday which it hopes will run
services to Germany through the Channel Tunnel, challenging
Eurostar's monopoly and Alstom trains.
 The ICE 3 train, which can hit 320 kilometres per hour, was
on display at London's St Pancras station following safety
tests. Deutsche Bahn is aiming to operate services from London
to Frankfurt and Cologne by the end of 2013.
 ""We see a London to Frankfurt service attracting 1.1 million
more passengers annually and a London to Cologne service adding
another million,"" Fabienne Lissak, a spokeswoman for Groupe
Eurotunnel, the operator of the Channel Tunnel, said.
 In 2009, Eurotunnel made 44 percent of its 571 million euros
revenue from Eurostar which currently enjoys a monopoly on the
track as sole rail passenger service operator, and from freight
service operators. Eurostar carried 9.2 million passengers
through the tunnel in 2009. Eurotunnel says that there is still
around 50 percent spare capacity.
 The German company aims to run services three times a day
between London and Amsterdam and Frankfurt. One 400 metre long
train would travel to Brussels and then split with one half
going on to Amsterdam and the other half travelling to Frankfurt
via Cologne.
 Eurostar, which is 55 percent owned by the French government
through state-owned railway group SNCF, has also ordered new
Siemens trains similar to the one on show in London on Tuesday.
 France has been vocal in opposing Eurostar's decision to
snub Alstom. Alstom and the French government say that Siemens
trains might not comply with safety rules on the tunnel.
 Deutsche Bahn said on Tuesday its safety tests had gone
better than expected.
 A Franco-British governmental commission is reviewing
regulations, such as those for trains that have a traction
system under their carriages, removing the need for locomotives
at each end.
 ""Our ICE 3 trains are very similar to the Valero trains that
Eurostar has ordered from Siemens, they are from the same
production line,"" a Deutsche Bahn spokesman said. Deutsche Bahn
has ordered 15 ICE 3 trains from Siemens for 500 million euros.
 ""The issues we will need approval for is distributed
traction and allowing our trains to split.""
 On Monday, a European Union source told Reuters that the
European Commission saw nothing wrong with Eurostar's
procurement process for the trains and that Alstom had not
officially referred the matter to European authorities.
 Deutsche Bahn expects that journeys to Cologne will take
just under 4 hours with Frankfurt 5 hours away.
 ""I definitely like trains more than airplanes, but they are
really turning trains into planes on rail,"" said Andrea Mubi, a
35-year-old Italian looking at the ICE 3 at the train station
after getting off a Eurostar train from Paris.
 With congestion and security measures at airports extending
the average London to Frankfurt flight duration of 1 hour and 40
minutes significantly, the German railway argues that passengers
will view a rail alternative more favourably.
 Driven by the allure of fast and cleaner commute and
supported by governments looking for alternatives to air travel,
an expansion of Europe's high-speed rail network should spell a
boom for rail operators, train manufacturers and contractors.
 Yet despite the international passenger market in the EU
opening up to competition since Jan. 1, state-owned firms still
dominate train operations while suppliers of rolling stock
coming from outside Europe have struggled to make inroads.
 In April, Deutche Bahn clinched a 1.58 billion pound
takeover of British transport group Arriva to create Europe's
No.1 passenger carrier, enlarging its footprint in rail, bus and
logistics outside Germany. 
 Eurostar is 40 percent owned by British-state owned LCR with
5 percent by Belgium's SNCB.

 By Sarah Marsh and Gernot Heller
 BERLIN, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Germany's economy will grow by
less than 1.5 percent in 2011, losing steam under the twin
threats of protectionism and a spiral of currency devaluations,
the head of the country's main foreign trade group (BGA) said.
 The estimate from the BGA, which earlier predicted the rate
of growth of German exports would halve next year, undercut a
forecast by leading think tanks last week for 2 percent growth
in Europe's largest economy. 
 Cabinet sources told Reuters at the weekend that the
government would raise its forecast to just under 2 percent.
 ""My expectation is for just under 1.5 percent, so between
1.25 and 1.5 percent for the coming year,"" BGA President Anton
Boerner told Reuters in an interview.
 Speaking before China raised interest rates for the first
time in nearly three years on Tuesday, sending the dollar higher
against a basket of currencies, Boerner said the world economy
would likely slow down in 2011.
 That was especially likely if the dollar fell in the wake of
a more expansive U.S. monetary policy and triggered a spiral of
currency devaluations.
 ""I see some risks coming especially from the Federal Reserve
and Mr Bernanke's printing too many dollars,"" said Boerner.
 ""This would in my opinion weaken the dollar, then we will
have some kind of round of (currency) weakening. The other
currencies and of course the euro will suffer from this because
we will be the last to weaken our currency.""

 Currency tensions have escalated in recent weeks in the
run-up to meetings of the Group of 20 leading nations in South
Korea, with countries at odds over what exchange rates are
appropriate for fostering balanced growth - though China's rate
hike took some of the heat out of the debate. [ID:nTOE69E02T]
 Concerns over the impact of a stronger euro on Germany's to
date impressive economic recovery were highlighted earlier this
month when data showed exports fell in August, narrowing the
trade balance.
 Underlying these disputes, economists say, is the fear that
countries will slip into a tit-for-tat round of devaluations in
an attempt to make their exports more competitive and preserve
jobs.
 ""If we see real pressure coming out from the American
taxpayer to do something, to short down the unemployment rate,
then indeed I fear that the dollar will go weaker,"" said
Boerner, adding that a global devaluation race could raise
inflation pressures worldwide in the medium term.
 
 PROTECTIONISM THREAT
 ""I fear another thing -- that there will be more
protectionism in worldwide trade and this will really harm the
European and German economy,"" said Boerner.
 Boerner said tariffs on Chinese imports being discussed in
the United States were a dangerous development.
 Germany was long the world's biggest exporter of goods until
it was overtaken by China last year. German exports fell sharply
in 2009 -- when the economy suffered its sharpest downturn since
World War Two -- but have bounced back this year.
 Earlier on Tuesday, the BGA said Germany would export goods
worth at least 1 trillion euros for the first time next year,
forecasting foreign sales would grow some 16 percent in 2010 and
up to seven percent in 2011. [ID:nLDE69I0TB]
 The World Trade Organization said on Monday governments had
largely resisted resorting to conventional trade measures such
as higher tariffs to protect jobs in the crisis, but friction
over exchange rates risked undermining that. [ID:nLDE69I0JH]
 Boerner rejected growing calls among policymakers and trade
unions for higher wages in Germany, saying this would damage the
country's competitiveness.
 ""We have to push up German domestic demand, not via wage
increases but via an increase in domestic investments,"" he said.
""There we have a big lack, especially in construction.""

(Adds forecasts from Reuters poll of primary dealers)
 By David Ljunggren
 OTTAWA, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada kept its
benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1 percent, as expected, on
Tuesday and cut growth forecasts, but surprised markets with a
dovish statement suggesting rates will stay on hold.
 The Canadian dollar fell to its lowest level in a month, on
the growing feeling that the central bank, which raised rates
three times in a row between June and September, would now keep
them steady for some time.
 ""At this time of transition in the global recovery, with a
weaker U.S. outlook, constraints beginning to moderate growth
in emerging market economies, and domestic considerations that
are expected to slow consumption and housing activity in
Canada, any further reduction in monetary policy stimulus would
need to be carefully considered,"" it said in a statement.
 A Reuters poll of Canada's 12 primary securities dealers
showed none expected a rate hike in December, but five
predicted a raise in the first quarter of next year.
 Based on a Reuters calculation, the market is pricing in an
95.19 percent chance rates will remain on hold at the Dec. 7
rate decision .
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For a graphic comparing Canadian and U.S. interest rates, see
http://r.reuters.com/qeq29p
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 The bank cut its 2010 growth forecast to 3.0 percent from
the 3.5 percent it forecast in July, and cut its 2011 forecast
to 2.3 percent from 2.9 percent. It raised its prediction for
2012 growth to 2.6 percent from 2.2 percent.
 The Canadian dollar dropped to around C$1.0360 to the U.S.
dollar, or 96.52 cents, from Monday's close of C$1.0141 to the
U.S. dollar, or 98.61 U.S. cents. It later recovered slightly.
 ""This is not just a data-watching central bank that is
keeping its powder dry in order to evaluate developments over
coming months -- this is a central bank that has totally
revised its outlook and market guidance,"" said Derek Holt and
Gorica Djeric of Scotia Capital.
 ""To us, the Bank of Canada is saying they are on hold until
late next year.""
 The central bank had taken a cautious line last month as
well, hinting that it was unlikely to keep raising rates while
the U.S. Federal Reserve seemed set to ease policy further.
 ""While Canada's circumstances ... dictate a different
policy stance than in the United States, there are limits to
this divergence,"" Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney said on
Sept 30.
 Carney has frequently expressed concern about rising
Canadian debt rates, fueled in part by the low cost of
borrowing.
 The bank said weak labor markets and ""ongoing deleveraging""
as advanced economies scale back stimulus packages and rein in
debt and budget deficits would bring a weaker-than-projected
recovery in the United States, Canada's main export market.
 ""Heightened tensions in currency markets and related risks
associated with global imbalances could result in a more
protracted and difficult global recovery,"" it added.
 Forecasting somewhat more subdued inflation, the bank said
it would take until the end of 2012 for core and total
inflation to converge at its 2 percent target. It previously
forecast both rates near 2 percent until the end of 2012.
""The inflation outlook has been revised down,"" it said.
 Core inflation, which strips out volatile items and the
effects of tax changes, was 1.6 percent in August, while
overall inflation was 1.7 percent. September inflation figures
are due for release on Friday.

 LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The dollar gained while the
Australian dollar and other commodity-linked currencies fell
sharply on Tuesday after China's central bank raised interest
rates, sparking a sell-off in perceived riskier currencies.
 The People's Bank of China surprised markets by raising its
benchmark one-year lending and deposit rate by 25 basis points
effective from Oct. 20, the first rate increase in nearly three
years. [ID:nSGE69I0HU]
 The euro extended losses against the dollar on the news, but
the Australian dollar was one of the main losers, with investors
concerned the move could dampen growth in China, hitting
commodity-linked economies in particular.
 ""The gut reaction of the market is to sell commodity block
and emerging market currencies,"" said Kit Juckes, currency
strategist at Societe Generale.
 But he added the move was ""not a game changer"", and that
investors would be looking to pick up these currencies on dips.
 The dollar extended earlier gains which came after U.S.
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said the United States would not
engage in dollar devaluation and needed to work hard to preserve
confidence in a strong dollar. [ID:nN18287076]
 At 1155 GMT, the euro  was down 0.6 percent, hitting a
session low of $1.3853, taking it well below Friday's eight and
a half month high of $1.4161, hit on trading platform EBS.
 The euro turned lower again, having earlier cut losses after
Germany's ZEW institute said its economic sentiment index was at
-7.2 in October, down from -4.3 in September but better than
forecasts of -8.0. [ID:nLDE69I0WE].
 The Australian dollar tumbled more than 1 percent on the day
to hit a session low of $0.9776 , a steep fall from
around $0.9885 before the China announcement.

 DOLLAR FIRMER
 Against a basket of currencies the dollar <.DXY> rose to a
session high of 77.720, its strongest in five days. Technical
analysts say it needs to extend above its Oct. 12 high of 77.93
to signal a short-term bottom is in place after Friday's
10-month trough of 76.144.
 The U.S. currency has been backed by a view among many in
the market that the monetary easing expected from the U.S.
Federal Reserve next month is largely priced in.
 But the market must wait to see how sizeable the QE will
actually be. Until then, short-term players were simply flipping
positions within tight ranges, traders said.
 ""Comments from Geithner and a reversal in short dollar
positions is pushing it higher,"" said Gareth Berry, currency
strategist at UBS, Singapore. ""But this will not last too long
with many waiting to see what the Fed will do next month.""
 A host of speakers from the Fed are due to speak on Tuesday.
More and more policymakers are signing up for QE, so any
indications how far the U.S. central bank will go to stimulate
the economy could weigh on the dollar.
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is scheduled to give brief remarks
while New York Fed President William Dudley, Chicago Fed chief
Charles Evans, Atlanta Fed chief Dennis Lockhart, Minneapolis
Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota and Dallas Fed President
Richard Fisher are expected to speak later in the day.
 Analysts said Geithner's comments on the U.S. dollar ahead
of the G-20 meeting meant the United States was trying to work
out an agreement with emerging economies like China which would
ease the currency tensions that have marked the past few weeks.
 The dollar rose 0.4 percent against the yen to 81.59 yen
, creeping further away from a 15-year low of 80.88 hit
last week and a record low of 79.75 set in 1995.

Columbia University think tank.
 The New York-based Vale Columbia Center for Sustainable
International Investment estimates outward foreign direct
investment (FDI) from China, already ranked fifth in the world,
rose at an annual rate of 44 percent in the first half of 2010.
 China's outward FDI, which involves buying or setting up
businesses rather than simply investing in financial market
assets such as U.S. Treasuries, has been growing at a phenomenal
pace.
 It more than doubled to $27 billion in 2007 from $12 billion
in 2005, and doubled again the following year to $56 billion,
the Vale paper said.
 Significantly, outward FDI nudged higher to $57 billion in
2009 despite the fact that world FDI flows collapsed by 50
percent due to the global recession and financial crisis.
 ""The increasing international competitiveness of Chinese
firms and an encouraging government policy have been the main
drivers of this surge,"" study authors Karl Sauvant and Ken
Davies wrote.
 Part of it, however, appeared to be stimulated by the 20
percent revaluation of China's currency against the dollar in
2005-2008.
 A weaker dollar makes it cheaper for overseas investors to
buy or set up firms. According to Vale, for example, Japan's
overseas FDI soared as its currency rose 50 percent against the
dollar in the late 1980s.
 China has signalled that it intends to let the yuan
strengthen gradually against the dollar, but has strongly
opposed demands by the United States that it quicken the pace.
 ""A renewed yuan appreciation would boost China's (outward)
FDI growth even further by lowering the cost of overseas assets
for Chinese firms, which have strong cash reserves from both
retained earnings and large-scale state credit allocations that
put them in a position to invest internationally,"" the study
said.
 ""Like competitors elsewhere, they need to invest abroad to
acquire a portfolio of locational assets to protect and increase
their international competitiveness through better access to
skills, technology, natural resources, and markets.""
 The other side of the coin, the Vale study noted, is that
yuan appreciation would make inward Chinese FDI more expensive
for foreign companies.
 It said foreign companies that already have a presence in
China would be best-placed to handle any change in exchange
rates.

on Tuesday it was raising its benchmark one-year interest rates
by 25 basis points with effect from Wednesday.
 Following are reactions from analysts and traders to the
news.
 
 WEI YAO, CHINA ECONOMIST AT SOCIETE GENERALE IN HONG KONG
 ""This is definitely a major surprise.
 ""China's central government is definitely more hawkish than
we think.
 ""The reasons are strong lending, sticky inflation and the
robust activity growth. Probably the September activity data is
stronger than the market expects, which gives the PBOC the extra
comfort in hiking.
 ""In the short term there are definitely several sectors that
will feel some pain, such as property and local government
financing platforms.""
 
 OLIVER PURSCHE, PRESIDENT, GARY GOLDBERG FINANCIAL SERVICES,
SUFFERN, NEW YORK:
 ""As much as this is a surprise, it is an expected surprise.
There's nothing shocking about it; China has done a good job of
telegraphing its moves. I think this is part of the overall
politics China is playing. They have an economy that's moving
faster than they'd like it to.
 ""I don't expect this to influence us much. The impact it'll
have should be minimal. The reason futures are down now is
because we've had a great run for the last 45 days, and then
both IBM and Apple disappointed yesterday after the close, which
is further evidence that, as optimistic as we are, things aren't
necessarily rosy. Continued caution is warranted, and we're
starting to increase our defensive position.""
 
 KIM JAE-EUN, ECONOMIST, HYUNDAI SECURITIES IN SEOUL
 ""The rate hike may be a political goodwill gesture to the
U.S., especially after the Treasury Department postponed its
report on the currency practices.""
 ""Still, the rate hike is expected to ease outside pressure
on the yuan's revaluations as it will attract more funds and
naturally lift the yuan.""
 ""The move indicated China would not artificially revaluate
the yuan due to outside pressure.""
 
 COMMERZBANK COMMODITIES ANALYST CARSTEN FRITSCH
 ""So far the tightening has not yet had any meaningful impact
on Chinese growth rates and oil demand. Crude oil imports have
come to record levels last month. But the move may raise
concerns at some point that the tightening could affect growth
rates.""
 
 MANIK NARAIN, UBS EMERGING CURRENCY STRATEGIST 
 ""We're seeing a pullback in high-beta, risky assets as this
move is seen as a strong policy tightening that will slow down
the Chinese economy.
 ""This is essentially an exit strategy and means that policy
has become less accomodative.
 ""It could also be intepreted as China's reluctance to use a
stronger yuan as a tool to tighten liquidity. We haven't seen an
acceleration in yuan appreciation at all. 
 ""It's a little hard to come to any strong conclusions but
this may not be positive for the markets if it represents a
possible rise in trade frictions between the U.S. and China.
This is arguably not the most healthy dynamic we're seeing.""
 
 ARNE LOHMAN RASMUSSEN, CHIEF ANALYST AT DANSKE BANK
 ""(The rate hike) will have a negative impact on base metals
because all things being equal, it will dampen growth in China
and it could also strengthen the dollar slightly. But we
shouldn't put too much weight on it because why are rates hiked
in the first place, they're hiked because growth is quite strong
in China.""
 
 ROB SUBBARAMAN, CHIEF NON-JAPAN ASIA ECONOMIST AT NOMURA IN
HONG KONG:
 ""We were forecasting a rate rise but were getting worried
that we were outliers.
 ""From our perspective, the economy looks to have stabilised
and is picking up again. Look at the PMI, bank lending and the
record rise in FX reserves. And fundamentally policy rates are
just too low for an economy that's growing around 10 percent.
 ""To avoid bigger distortions, China needs to start moving
rates to more appropriate levels.
 ""China's economy looks as though it's decoupling from other
major economies, and its policies should as well."" 
 
 ANANTH NARAYAN G, STANDARD CHARTERED BANK, MUMBAI
 ""Unlikely we'll see many more hikes, so actual impact might
be limited...plus they might also continue to use currency to
tighten (monetary policy).""
 
 DARIUSZ KOWALCZYK, SENIOR ECONOMIST AND STRATEGIST AT CREDIT
AGRICOLE CIB IN HONG KONG:
 ""The market was unprepared for the hikes so yuan swap rates
will rise at the short end and the curve will flatten. There
will be more portfolio inflows and yuan will likely gain in the
NDF market, but on the other hand there is less need for China
to appreciate yuan in the spot market given that inflation is
now tackled through rates.""
 ""They did it now likely because Thursday's GDP/CPI data is
too strong for them. Also it's after the Communist Party meeting
ended and a new 5-yr plan was adopted.""
 
 ZHU JIANFANG, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT CITIC SECURITIES IN
BEIJING:
 ""The recent rise in headline inflation has put the real rate
into negative territory. And I think that's why the central bank
needs to raise interest rates in such a hasty way.""
 ""Besides, the negative real rates will also place increasing
pressure on asset prices, as depositors tend to channel their
money from bank accounts to the property market.""

 HITENDRA DAVE, HEAD OF GLOBAL MARKETS, HSBC INDIA, MUMBAI:
 ""China hasn't raised so far and (they) have only been
raising the reserve requirements. With all the asset price
speculation, they had to raise rates to normalise policy. It is
the local factors that led them to take this decision.""
 
 KORNELIUS PURPS, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST WITH UNICREDIT IN
MUNICH
 ""The authorities are eager to moderate the housing sector
without dampening the overall economy's growth. This should not
be interpreted as an impediment to global growth.""
 
 CHRIS TURNER, HEAD OF FX STRATEGY AT ING
 ""This is part of the moderate tightening cycle that we are
seeing from Chinese authorities to balance their economy. It is
part of the normalisation of interest rates in an economy which
is growing at a modestly fast clip. The market is reacting like
there is an increased risk of hard landing with the commodity
currencies like the Aussie being sold off, but I don't think
that is the case.""
 
 BEN SIMPFENDORFER, CHIEF CHINA ECONOMIST AT RBS
 ""A surprise, but welcome, hike. It suggests strong inflation
and GDP figures on Thursday, but also some concern about
property.""
 
 RUPA REGE NITSURE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, BANK OF BARODA, MUMBAI:
 ""One thing is sure, that if they have raised interest rates
now, then it creates ground for the yuan to appreciate. So it
will be difficult for them to keep away the appreciation
pressure on their currency"".
 
 KIT JUCKES, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, SOCIETE GENERALE, LONDON
 ""This means China is concerned that bank lending and
domestic asset price inflation are too strong and they will have
to accept a stronger currency.
 ""The gut reaction of the market is to sell commodity block
and emerging market currencies. But it's not a game changer and
there will probably be a queue of people looking to buy EM
currencies on dips.""
 
 PARK TAE-GEUN, BOND ANALYST, HANWHA SECURITIES IN SEOUL
 ""The decision caught markets off guard. Raising lending
rates is more than a liquidity control and can be taken as a
tightening signal.""
 
 SIMON DERRICK, HEAD OF FX RESEARCH AT BANK OF NEW YORK
MELLON
 ""The PBOC move follows a clear need by the Chinese
authorities to take out some of the heat from the economy.
Whether this move will lead to a broader move on its currency is
open to debate. It certainly leads to speculation that the U.S.
and China are in some sort of a deal which will perhaps see the
U.S. taking a more gradualist approach to QE. The dollar has
already moved higher after this news.""

 * No EU ban seen on food from the offspring of clones
 * Animal welfare group says EU bowing to outside pressure
 
 By Charlie Dunmore
 BRUSSELS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The European Union announced
plans on Tuesday to temporarily ban the use of animal cloning
for food production, while allowing imports of food derived from
the offspring of clones from the United States and elsewhere.
 The report from the European Commission followed a call by
EU lawmakers in July for a total ban on food derived from cloned
animals and their traditionally bred offspring, citing ethical
concerns over the industrial production of cloned meat.
 The Commission said a temporary five-year EU ban on cloning
for food production was justified on animal welfare grounds, but
said banning imports of food from the offspring of clones was
unnecessary and would disrupt global trade.
 ""Food from cloned animals is safe. In fact, the scientific
opinion is that it cannot be differentiated in any way from food
from normally bred animals. The issue is animal welfare,"" EU
Health and Consumer Commissioner John Dalli told reporters.
 Food derived from the offspring of clones presents no such
animal welfare issues, and banning its sale and import would be
impossible because the origin is untraceable, Dalli said.
 ""Such a prohibition would lead to a ban of imports of any
food of animal origin (meat, milk and processed products) from
third countries allowing the cloning technique,"" the report
said.
 ""We're not going to regulate for the world,"" Dalli added.
 But animal welfare groups criticised the Commission's
decision, saying it had bowed to pressure from third countries.
 ""We do not accept the Commission's position that it would be
impossible to enforce a ban that includes the offspring of
cloned animals, as (other) meat traceability systems are already
in place,"" said Sonja Van Tichelen, director of the Eurogroup
for Animals.
 
 GROWING WORLD MARKET
 Animal cloning, which uses DNA transfer to create an exact
genetic copy of an animal, currently has a success rate of below
20 percent as most cloned animals die during or shortly after
birth.
 The technique is complex and costly, ensuring that cloned
animals are unlikely to be used directly as food, but they can
be bred traditionally to produce offspring that share similar
traits, such as high milk production or rapid growth.
 The United States is the most advanced country in terms of
animal cloning for food production, with estimates provided by
companies suggesting that ""thousands of cattle"" and ""hundreds of
pigs"" have been cloned there so far, the Commission said.
 The U.S. currently has a voluntary moratorium on the
marketing of food from cloned animals but not from their
offspring.
 ""Therefore products of offspring of clones have entered the
food chain, not only in the U.S. but also in other parts of the
world, not least in Brazil where there are five companies
involved in cloning,"" said the report.
 The five-year moratorium proposed by the Commission would
also cover imports of live clones from outside the 27-nation
bloc, but imports of embryos and semen from clones would be
allowed, provided that operators follow proposed traceability
rules.
 That means EU producers would also be free to sell food
products derived from the offspring of clones, provided they
import the necessary genetic material from the U.S. or
elsewhere.
 The Commission said it would publish legislative proposals
introducing the new rules next year, which must then be jointly
approved by EU governments and lawmakers.
 There is likely to be opposition to the plans in the
European Parliament, which has called for a complete ban on food
from clones and their offspring. EU governments have said the
sale of food from the offspring of clones should be allowed.
In August, it emerged that meat from the offspring of a
cloned cow was placed on the market by a dairy farm in Scotland,
which led some British supermarkets to pledge not to sell any
meat from clones or their young.

 * Comments underline WTO concern
 GENEVA, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The head of the World Trade
Organization has stepped into an escalating row over currency
policies, saying growing disputes about exchange rates could
threaten global trade.
 WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy said governments had
largely resisted resorting to conventional trade measures such
as higher tariffs to protect jobs in the wake of the crisis, but
friction over exchange rates risked undermining that.
 ""For the moment it's a risk, but it's a risk that can be
dangerous for trade,"" he told reporters late on Monday.
 Lamy has in the past refused to get involved in discussions
about currencies, arguing that such matters are primarily the
mandate of the International Monetary Fund.
 But the comments, following an interview in a British
newspaper on Thursday, indicate that the body that polices world
trade is getting increasingly concerned about currency policies.
 Currency tensions are likely to dominate next month's summit
of the G20.
 The United States and European Union are calling on China to
let its yuan appreciate, China has condemned lax monetary policy
in the United States for distorting the global economy, Japan
and Switzerland have been selling their currencies to ward off
deflation and emerging economies from Thailand to Brazil are
seeking to block inflationary capital inflows.
 Underlying these disputes, economists say, is the fear that
countries will slip into a tit-for-tat round of devaluation to
make exports more competitive and preserve jobs.
 WTO rules do include an article that requires members not to
circumvent trade agreements through exchange rate policy.
 But this measure has never been tested in a WTO dispute.
 Lamy declined to comment on the bill passed by the U.S.
House of Representatives that would allow the U.S. government to
treat China's undervalued currency as a subsidy and impose
countervailing duties in response.

 * BGA says currency devaluation poses risk to trade
 * China must ensure realistic exchange rate - BGA
 
 By Sarah Marsh
 BERLIN, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Germany's exports should grow
some 16 percent this year and up to seven percent in 2011, its
exporters association forecast on Tuesday, though it warned that
currency tensions may lead to a rise in protectionism.
 Foreign Trade Association (BGA) President Anton Boerner told
reporters in Berlin the group expected Germany would export
goods worth at least one trillion euros for the first time next
year following a sharp rebound in foreign demand in 2010.
 ""All in all, we're predicting the strongest increase in
foreign trade for ten years in 2010,"" he said. ""For 2011, I
expect exports to grow by up to seven percent to 1,003 billion
euros.""
 Boerner said the biggest risk to German exporters was a
currency devaluation spiral and said that a depreciation in the
value of the U.S. dollar was likely to continue due to its
expansive monetary policy.
 ""The biggest risk factor for me is the problem of
devaluation arising from the dollar,"" said Boerner.
 Tariffs on Chinese imports being discussed in the United
States were dangerous, he said.
 ""When such a big country takes such measures, then other
countries will and must follow suit,"" he said.
 Germany was long the world's biggest exporter of goods until
it was overtaken by China last year. German exports fell sharply
in 2009 -- when the economy suffered its sharpest downturn since
World War Two -- but have bounced back this year.
 Leading research institutes advising Chancellor Angela
Merkel's government last week forecast German exports to rise
15.3 percent in 2010 and 7.1 percent in 2011. [ID:nBAF004293]
German exports fell in August for a second straight month,
narrowing the trade balance and adding to concerns that a
stronger euro may weigh on the pace of the economic recovery.
 Separately on Tuesday, the influential ZEW think tank said
that while the outlook for consumer spending in Germany was
healthy, export growth will likely be more muted.
[ID:nDEP003368]
 Boerner said it was time China turned its back on ""unfair
trading practices on raw materials"" and took steps to ensure a
""realistic exchange rate"" for the yuan currency.
 ""However, we also reject resorting to general China bashing.
By no stretch of the imagination can we see a 'yellow peril,'""
he added. ""China is always welcome as a partner for trade and
investment provided it sticks to the rules of the game.""
 The BGA forecast imports would rise by some 17 percent this
year by up to eight percent in 2011.

 TEHRAN, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Iran confirmed on Tuesday that
some companies were refusing to refuel its planes at European
airports and said it would retaliate if the situation continued.
 Iran has played down the impact of international sanctions,
which were tightened in June, and previously said news reports
that Iranian airlines were having problems refuelling abroad
were part of a ""psychological war"".
 But when asked about the issue at his weekly news
conference, foreign ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said,
""Unfortunately, some western companies have adopted
inappropriate policies.
 ""Our advice to their governments is not to act beyond the
regulations and even that illegal resolution,"" he said,
referring to the new U.N. sanctions aimed at pressuring Iran
over its nuclear programme.
 Royal Dutch Shell  was among the first to decide not
to renew its contracts to supply Iran Air with fuel, an industry
source said in July. Other companies have since been cited in
news reports as cutting supplies to the Iranian flag carrier.
 ""The continuation of this approach by these companies will
jeopardise their interests ... besides we will not tolerate it,
and confronting them is in the agenda,"" Mehmanparast said. He
did not specify what form any retaliation might take.
 Iran has been hit by a new wave of international sanctions
over its nuclear enrichment activities. The United States and
its European allies fear Iran is trying to build a bomb under
cover of a civilian nuclear program. Iran says it needs nuclear
technology to generate power and is not seeking atomic weapons.

 * Short-dated bonds sensitive to normalisation comments
 * Peripheral spreads steady in early trade
 
 By William James
 LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Bund yields edged lower across
the curve on Tuesday with investors looking to German data and
speeches from euro zone policymakers for fresh signals on the
pace of economic recovery and policy normalisation.
 The short end of the German yield curve has been sensitive
in recent days to comments on the ECB's determination to
continue a withdrawal of the extraordinary support it has
provided to the banking system since 2008.
 But differing views on the pace of the moves -- notably
between the hawkish Bundesbank chief Axel Weber, and a more
cautious approach from ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet -- have
caused uncertainty and fuelled volatility.
 ""There really seems to be a divide, and any comments which
give a hint on how the situation is evolving are really moving
the market ... especially at the very short end,"" said Michael
Leister, strategist at WestLB in Dusseldorf.
 Signs that the ECB was leaning toward a more hawkish stance
could send two-year German yields as high as 1 percent in the
short term, analysts said.
 Investor sentiment indicators from Germany, the euro zone's
largest economy, could also add to views on whether the ECB's
target of withdrawing support measures is credible.
 A survey by the ZEW think tank was expected to show investor
morale worsened during October, with the sentiment indicator
forecast at -8.0, down from -4.3 in September. A separate
indicator of current conditions was forecast to show improvement
in October. 
 ""If the outlook comes in worse than expected that should
support Bunds, it fits in with the view that the growth we saw
earlier in the year isn't sustainable,"" a trader said.
 However traders stressed that with much of the focus on the
short end of the curve and money market rates, the indicator
would have to miss forecasts by a sizeable margin to provoke a
strong reaction in Bunds.
 The Bund future was 1 tick lower at 130.53. The 10-year
German bond yield was 2.381 percent, down 0.4 bps on the day
while the two-year Schatz yield was 0.893 percent, down 1 bps.
 
 PORTUGUESE BUDGET
 After rallying strongly over the last week, the currency
bloc's higher yielding sovereigns were steady in early trade,
with much of the attention centring on Portugal with the
country's opposition party meeting to discuss a draft budget.
 Markets look confident that the government will pass its
2011 budget without political hitches, with the
Portuguese/German 10-year yield spread has tightened by around
90 bps since Oct. 8.
 That is despite the opposition's continued refusal to come
to terms on a budget that is crucial to Portugal's efforts to
avoid a slide into fiscal crisis and an EU bailout similar to
that given to Greece.
 ""There's too much political pressure for there to be any
major wrangling... It should get pushed through without any
major problems,"" said Orlando Green, rate strategist at Credit
Agricole.
 The Portuguese spread was last at 321 bps, flat on the day.

 By Tetsushi Kajimoto
 TOKYO, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Japan's government said on Tuesday
that the economy was now at a standstill, highlighting the
growing gulf between developed and emerging countries at the
heart of global currency tensions.
 In a monthly report, the government downgraded its assessment
of the economy for the first time since February 2009. A senior
Japanese official said further pressure on the economy, which is
mired in stubborn deflation, could tip it into recession.
 ""If the economy turns out as expected in our main scenario,
we may end up describing the current situation as a soft patch,""
said the official at the Cabinet Office, which compiled the
report.
 ""But if it comes under further downward pressure, it could
end up slipping into recession,"" he said.
 Faltering recoveries from the global financial crisis in
developed economies have pushed global investors into emerging
markets in search of higher returns, driving up their currencies.
 The move has been exacerbated by widespread expectations that
the U.S. Federal Reserve will print billions of dollars to try to
lift the U.S. economy, sparking concerns that the extra liquidity
will find its way into emerging markets.
 The currency tensions will dominate a Group of 20 finance
ministers' meeting in South Korea starting on Friday and a G20
summit in November, as officials look to tackle the economic
imbalances and the threat of competitive currency devaluation.
 ""Currencies will be the topic that many people will be
talking about ... at the G20. I hope that good ideas will be put
forward there and we will explain the present situation in
Japan,"" Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said.
 Japan's policymakers have grown increasingly concerned by a
slowdown in growth in the export-reliant economy, prompting the
government to draw up a supplementary budget and the central bank
to offer cheap loans and to promise to buy assets.
 A rise in the yen to a 15-year high against the dollar added
to these woes, sparking the first currency intervention by Japan
in six years.
 YEN'S RISE HURTS
 The latest assessment by the government was the first time
since July 2008 -- just before the onset of the last global
recession -- that it had described the economic situation as at a
standstill.
 It said the economy could be depressed by a slowdown in the
global economy and swings in share prices and foreign exchange
rates as a rising yen threatens exports.
 ""Economic movements appear to be pausing recently,"" the
report said, while repeating that the economy was in a mild
deflationary phase.
 Previously, it had said the situation was becoming
increasingly severe although the economy was recovering, with
some movement seen toward a self-sustaining recovery.
 The report said some weakness could be expected for the time
being but the economy was likely to pick up with help from
improvement in overseas economies and government stimulus steps.
 The government also cut its view on exports and industrial
output, saying they were weakening, which prompted the downgrade
of its overall economic assessment.
 A senior government official warned that if weakness
persisted in exports, due to a slowdown in Asian economies, and
in production, it would hurt corporate capital spending and
personal consumption, choking off movement towards a
self-sustaining economic recovery.
 The yen's rise clouds the outlook as it dampens sentiment, he
added.
 The yen is still close to a 15-year high against the dollar,
undermining the earnings and competitiveness of Japan's export
sector and so acting as a drag on the stock market.
 The government said it wanted the Bank of Japan to support
the economy through ""appropriate and flexible"" monetary policy
while the two branches work closely together -- phrasing it used
when it announced 5.05 trillion yen ($62 billion) in stimulus
spending on Oct. 8.
 The central bank surprised markets on Oct. 5 by cutting
interest rates and pledging to buy 5 trillion yen worth of assets
to pump more money into the flagging economy.
 Japan's economic growth slowed from an annual clip of 5
percent in January-March to 1.5 percent in the second quarter,
with analysts expecting it to hit a soft patch ahead as the
global economy slows and stimulus-driven consumption runs its
course.

 By Pavel Polityuk
 KIEV, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Ukrainian grain export quotas took
effect on Tuesday at a total of 2.7 million tonnes as the
government aimed to prevent a sharp jump in domestic prices
after a severe drought reduced the 2010 harvest.
 Official newspaper Uryadovy Kurier published a government
resolution detailing the quotas, which covered 2 million tonnes
of maize, 500,000 tonnes of wheat and 200,000 tonnes of barley
and would run until Dec. 31, 2010.
 Two leading grain exporters in the Black Sea region, Ukraine
and Russia, have been hit by the drought, which destroyed large
grain areas and forced Russia to ban grain exports this season.
 Agriculture officials have estimated the 2010/2011 harvest
at about 38 million tonnes, down from 46 million the previous
year. Ukraine consumes about 26 million tonnes of grain per
season.
 UkrAgroConsult agriculture consultancy said the quotas could
help the government reduce local grain prices in the near future
but that significant stocks would prompt the cabinet to avoid
export curbs in the second half of the season.
 ""We forecast that domestic prices could slightly decrease,""
UkrAgroConsult director Serhiy Feofilov told Reuters.
 According to UkrAgroConsult data, domestic soft milling
wheat prices rose to an average of $195 per tonne ex-farm as of
Oct. 18 from about $184 per tonne in late September.
 Ukrainian milling wheat cost about $152 per tonnes ex-farm
in early July, 2010.
 
 FREE EXPORTS IN 2011?
 Feofilov said Ukraine had enough grain in stocks to ensure
free exports in the second half of this season and that the
government was likely to cancel the limits in January.
 ""The government is unlikely to impose new quotas in early
2011 because grain stocks are high,"" Feofilov said.
 Farm ministry's officials have said that this year's harvest
allows Ukraine to export up to 13 million tonnes of grain this
season, compared with 21.5 million in 2009/10.
 Analysts and Ukrainian traders' union UZA predicted before
the quotas that exports would be as much as 15 million tonnes
and that the total grain supply could reach more than 40 million
tonnes due to high stocks.
 Feofilov said Ukraine could export about 7 million tonnes of
grain in July-December 2010, including 2.7 million under the
quotas.
 UkrAgroConsult had said in a statement on Tuesday that
Ukraine exported 585,300 tonnes of grain Oct.1-12 against
482,100 in the same period in September. The country exported
3.45 million tonnes of grain in July-September.
 But another analyst, Mykola Vernytsky from ProAgro
consultancy, said the quotas in 2011 would depend on WTO
reaction on the current curbs and the level of global grain
prices.
 ""If the reaction by the World Trade Organisation is calm,
Ukraine could maintain quotas for the second half of this
season. If not, we could cancel official limits and renew
non-official curbs which we had before,"" Vernytsky said.
 In late July, Ukraine's Customs Service imposed additional
quality checks for exporting wheat, which delayed shipments. The
customs lifted the checks in early October.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The dollar gained against a
basket of currencies on Tuesday, backed by worries among some
players that the monetary easing expected from the U.S. Federal
Reserve next month is already largely priced in.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner's comment that the
United States would not engage in dollar devaluation and needed
to work hard to preserve confidence in a strong dollar, also
offered some support to the ailing greenback.
 ""Comments from Geithner and a reversal in short dollar
positions is pushing it higher,"" said Gareth Berry, currency
strategist at UBS, Singapore. ""But this will not last too long
with many waiting to see what the Fed will do next month.""
Investors have been selling the dollar for weeks on
expectations the Federal Reserve will decide to pump more cash
into the U.S. economy at its Nov. 2-3 meeting. 
 But currencies like the euro and the Australian dollar that
had broken higher ground against the dollar are giving up some
of those gains -- suggesting markets think much of the trade is
done.
 But the market still has to wait and see how sizeable the QE
will actually be. Until then, traders and analysts said
short-term players were simply flipping positions within tight
ranges.
 The dollar index firmed 0.5 percent to 77.34. Technical
analysts say it needs to extend above its Oct. 12 high of 77.93
to signal a short-term bottom is in place after Friday's
10-month trough of 76.144.
 A host of speakers from the Fed are due to speak on Tuesday.
More and more policymakers are signing up for QE, so any
indications on how far the U.S. central bank will go to
stimulate the economy could weigh on the dollar.
 Fed Chairman, Ben Bernanke, is scheduled to give brief
remarks while New York Fed President William Dudley, Chicago Fed
chief Charles Evans, Atlanta Fed chief Dennis Lockhart,
Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota and Dallas Fed
President Richard Fisher are expected to speak later in the day.
 
 G20 EFFORTS
 Analysts said Geithner's comments on the U.S. dollar ahead
of the G-20 meeting meant the U.S. was probably trying to work
out an agreement with emerging economies which would ease the
currency tensions that have marked the past few weeks.
 ""We are seeing the U.S. give up some ground as his comments
indicate that QE may be a gradualist approach and Asian
economies need not worry too much about a falling dollar,"" said
Ian Stannard, senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas.
 ""A gradual approach to QE will have a less impact on the
dollar.""
 A number of Asian and emerging countries have stepped up
intervention or imposed capital controls to stem a rapid
appreciation in their currencies against the dollar which many
feel can harm exports.
 The euro dipped 0.24 percent to $1.3912, well below Friday's
eight-month high, with investors awaiting the influential German
ZEW survey for October.
 The euro has so far failed to clear $1.4000 again since
Friday's surge above $1.4100. This was seen by some as a warning
that more long euro/short dollar positions could unwind, with
the euro's Oct. 12 low of $1.3775 seen as a possible target.
 The dollar edged up 0.12 percent against the yen to 81.35
yen, creeping further away from a 15-year low of 80.88 hit last
week and a record low of 79.75 set in 1995.
 Earlier in the day, there was talk of dollar selling by
Japanese exporters at levels near 81.30 yen.
 The Australian dollar fell 0.13 percent to $0.9885, paring
earlier losses after the Reserve Bank of Australia's minutes
from its Oct. 5 meeting said the arguments to hold or hike rates
were finely balanced.

 By Hideyuki Sano and Yoshiyasu Shida
 TOKYO, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Japan's Meiji Yasuda Life said on
Tuesday it plans to increase its holdings of yen bonds by 400
billion yen ($4.9 billion) and will buy a net 200 billion yen of
foreign bonds in the six months to March.
 The insurer, Japan's third-largest with total assets of 25
trillion yen, will likely buy much of the foreign bonds without
currency hedging as it sees limited room for the yen to rise.
 ""We think the yen is at reasonable levels to start new
foreign investments,"" Yasuharu Takamatsu, Meiji Yasuda's director
of investments, told a news conference.
 Meiji Yasuda already increased its unhedged foreign bond
holdings by 270 billion yen while cutting unhedged foreign bond
positions by 120 billion yen in April-September, the company
said.
 The firm sees the dollar trading between 78 and 90 yen in
October-March, and at 87 yen by the end of March.
 The dollar hit a 15-year low of 80.88 yen late last week,
approaching a record low of 79.75 yen marked in 1995.
 Meiji Yasuda expects Japanese authorities to conduct currency
market intervention on suitable occasions and believes the Bank
of Japan's new easing steps will help limit future gains in the
yen.
 Earlier this month, the BOJ announced a plan to set up a fund
to buy five trillion yen in assets, including government bonds
and more risky assets such as exchange traded funds (ETFs) and
real estate investment trusts (REITs).
 The plan is seen as a pre-emptive move to counter the impact
of the pressure on the dollar from likely monetary easing by the
Federal Reserve early next month.
 COMMITTED TO GREENBACK
 Meiji Yasuda said its foreign bond portfolio will remain
centred on the dollar. According to the company, three quarters
of its foreign-denominated assets were in dollars in March.
 The insurer also said it will increase its yen bond holdings
by 400 billion yen in the second half to March, after boosting
them by 1.1 trillion yen in the first half.
 The company expects Japanese bond yields to remain stuck at
relatively low levels as it thinks the Japanese economy will hit
a soft patch and banks will continue to pour cash into domestic
bonds.
 It expects the 10-year JGB yield to move between 0.7 and 1.2
percent in the second half, and to end the financial year at
around 1.0 percent. It hit a seven-year low of 0.82 percent
earlier this month.
 But should the yield fall too much, the insurer could
consider selling some of its yen bond holdings, the company said.
 ""If the yield keeps falling, that causes us a problem
(because of lower income gains.) We will have to keep buying a
certain amount of bonds but if we judge bonds are overbought from
every perspective, we could sell some of our holdings,"" Takamatsu
said.
 Meiji Yasuda also plans to raise its holdings of foreign
shares, including those from Asian emerging markets, by 50
billion yen in October-March.
 The company cut its Japanese share holdings by 200 billion
yen in the half year to September. Many Japanese insurers have
been reducing Japanese shares as stock market volatility puts
their financial health at risk.
 Meiji Yasuda plans to slightly cut its stock holdings, which
stood at 2.68 trillion yen as of September, the company said.

 * World Bank says China should have rates in policy tool kit
 BEIJING, Oct 19 (Reuters) - China should mainly rely on
quantitative monetary tools to curb inflation and not raise
interest rates this year, Wang Yong, a central bank researcher,
said in an article published on Tuesday.
 China has not raised its benchmark interest rates so far this
year, even though inflation-adjusted deposit rates have been
negative since February.
 Most economists do not expect a rise this year, but Louis
Kuijs, senior economist at the World Bank's Beijing office, said
increasing rates would give China greater autonomy to adapt
monetary policy to domestic economic conditions.
 ""Having interest rates as one of the instruments to change
monetary policy, this is largely a question of efficiency and of
better allocation of financial resources,"" Kuijs told reporters.
 Wang, a professor at the training school at a local branch of
the People's Bank of China, said China should make the yuan more
flexible by increasing its two-way movements.
 ""But yuan reform must be carried out in line with China's own
need and should never rise fast under pressure from the United
States and Europe,"" he said in an article published in the
Shanghai Securities News.
 To ease pressure for yuan appreciation, China should loosen
rules regarding foreign exchange in support of domestic firms
investing abroad, he added.
 Ardo Hansson, the World Bank's lead economist in Beijing,
restated the lender's view that real appreciation of the yuan was
in China's interests for many reasons.
 He was speaking at the same briefing as Kuijs, who said China
was right to retain capital controls even as it steps up efforts
to internationalise the yuan -- a policy he called sensible.
 ""Especially in episodes like we are facing today with the
possibility of more inflows coming from international liquidity,
I think it makes sense to keep those controls. This is not the
time to start to relax,"" Kuijs said.

 By Kevin Plumberg
 HONG KONG, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar edged higher
for a third consecutive day on Tuesday, driven by traders
continuing to take profits on gains in other currencies, while
weakness in the technology and commodity sectors limited gains
in Asian stocks.
 Major European stocks opened weaker, with Britain's FTSE
100 <.FTSE>, France's CAC 40 <.FCHI> and Germany's DAX <.GDAXI>
all down 0.2 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> fell 0.1
percent.
 The dollar also found support after U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner affirmed the government's desire for a strong
currency for the first time since February, providing a reason
for dealers to take profits on other currencies' strength in
the run up to weekend meetings of G20 finance ministers.
[ID:nN18291636]
 However, deep-seated concerns remained among global
policymakers that the Federal Reserve's path to quantitative
easing would keep the dollar weak and maintain sharp upward
pressure on the currencies of other economies, especially in
the emerging markets.
 That means that despite the likelihood of the dollar
strengthening even further in the next few days, the popular
trade of selling dollars to buy emerging market equities and
commodities is still in play.
 ""The reasons for the dollar being weaker, principally that
move towards QE, are still very valid, so any pullbacks are not
going to be enormous,"" said Gregg Gibbs, currency strategist
with Royal Bank of Scotland in Sydney.
 The euro was at $1.3900 , down 0.3 percent from late
in New York on Monday.
 The euro has been unable to maintain a foothold above $1.40
in October, which may cause more frustrated traders to turn
tail and sell it off to $1.3775 over the next few days.
 The U.S. dollar index, which measures performance against a
basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.4 percent

 * Euro has scope to $1.3775 if deeper correction unfolds
 By Charlotte Cooper and Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The dollar gingerly tested firmer
ground on Tuesday after a bout of choppiness, and players didn't
rule out an eventual 1.5 cent retreat by the euro if some long
positions grew stale and unwound ahead of expected U.S. easing.
 With quantitative easing from the Federal Reserve now
well-priced in ahead of its Nov. 2-3 meeting, currencies have
broken higher ground against the dollar, with the euro topping
$1.4160 last week and the Australian dollar testing parity.
 But squeezing out more gains is likely to be tough until the
market sees how sizeable QE will be, with one trader saying, for
Tuesday at least, short-term players were simply flipping
positions within tight ranges.
 The euro has failed to clear $1.4000 again after Friday's
surge above $1.4100 and this was seen as a caution by some that
more long euro/short dollar positions could unwind, with the
euro's Oct. 12 low of $1.3775 seen as a possible target.
 ""I think we will see a pull-back in the euro in the
near-term,"" said a Japanese brokerage house trader, noting the
recent build-up of short dollar positions.
 ""The market probably has gone as far as it can go based on
the factors in the United States.""
 The euro was flat at $1.3933, well below Friday's eight-month
high. Initial support is expected at $1.3825, with resistance up
at $1.40 and a move above $1.4050 needed to restart its rally.
 But as traders play a waiting game, even moves down might not
be sustained for long, with macro funds ready to buy as
currencies fall against the dollar, said Robert Ryan, FX
strategist at BNP Paribas in Singapore. 
 ""Some positions will have been chopped over the past two days
but it seems there's more support on the downside.""
 Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner gave a brief fillip to the
dollar after he said the United States would not engage in dollar
devaluation and also needed to work hard to preserve confidence
in a strong dollar.
 Analysts said the comment had little lasting impact beyond
being a reassurance from the U.S. for investors to maintain
confidence in the dollar as the world's reserve currency, after
the greenback's fall of the past few months, and as tensions stir
ahead of meetings of the G20 on talk of competitive devaluations.
 ""You can imagine that the U.S. might think it's time to say
or do something which helps stabilise the dollar for the near
term,"" said Greg Gibbs, currency strategist at Royal Bank of
Scotland in Sydney.
 The dollar index firmed 0.3 percent to 77.281. Technical
analysts say it needs to extend above its Oct. 12 high of 77.93
to signal a short-term bottom is in place after Friday's 10-month
trough of 76.144.
 The dollar edged up against the yen to 81.38 yen, creeping
further away from a 15-year low of 80.88 hit last week and a
record low of 79.75 set in 1995.
 SOME SUPPORT
 The dollar drew some support from buying by Japanese
importers, a trader said. But Japanese exporters were seen
selling at levels near 81.30 yen, helping limit dollar gains.
 The Nikkei business daily said major Japanese manufacturers
were are planning to lower their assumed dollar/yen exchange
rates for the fiscal second half to around 80 to 85 yen.
 The Australian dollar fell 0.3 percent to $0.9867, correcting
further after charging to parity with the U.S. dollar on Friday.
 It initially firmed after the Reserve Bank of Australia's
minutes from its on Oct. 5 meeting said the arguments to hold or
hike rates were finely balanced, but later gave up the gains.
 The RBA, which has been raising rates when the likes of the
U.S. and other developed economies have been looking to ease,
judged it had the flexibility to keep rates unchanged in October
as a rising local dollar tightened monetary conditions, while
domestic credit growth remained weak and global growth uncertain.

 * Says didn't mean to criticise China, South Korea on FX
 * Division over FX policies seen dominating G20 meetings
 * Japan to act against rapid FX moves if necessary
(Adds quotes, details)
 By Tetsushi Kajimoto
 TOKYO, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Japan's finance minister said
excessive capital flows to emerging economies are boosting their
currencies and he expects G20 finance leaders to seek ways to
stabilise currencies at a meeting this week in South Korea.
 Yoshihiko Noda, speaking to reporters in parliament, said the
international community must work together to achieve currency
stability, which is essential for the world economy to recover
fully from the last recession.
 ""Currencies will be the topic that many people will be
talking about ... at the G20. I hope that good ideas will be put
forward there and we will explain the present situation in
Japan,"" Noda told a news conference after a cabinet meeting.
 He reiterated that Japan would act decisively against
excessive currency moves as needed, signalling his readiness to
intervene to stem rises in the yen, which is on the verge of
surging to a fresh 15-year high below 81 to the dollar.
 Global currency strains are intensifying as financial markets
factor in the prospect of the Federal Reserve cranking up the
dollar printing presses to try to revive the faltering U.S.
economic recovery.
 Economic imbalances, the falling dollar and upward pressure
on emerging market currencies are expected to dominate discussion
at meetings in South Korea of G20 finance ministers from Oct. 22
and of national leaders from Nov. 11.
 Noda said there was some misunderstanding about his remarks
last week about Chinese and South Korean currency policies,
apparently backing away from comments that called into question
South Korea's leadership of the Group of 20 nations forum because
of Seoul's interventions to stem the won's rise and that chided
China for moving slowly on yuan reform.
 ""There seems to be some misunderstanding,"" Noda said,
referring to the comments made in parliament last week. He added
that he did not mean to criticise the countries' currency
policies.
 Noda said he had merely repeated his expectations for steady
progress in Chinese yuan reform, while expecting South Korea to
take a major role in steering debate on currency issues at the
G20 meeting.
 Noda had also insisted last week that Japan's own currency
intervention on Sept. 15 was qualitatively different from South
Korea's interventions.

 SYDNEY, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Australia's central bank said
its decision to not raise rates this month was ""finely
balanced"" and that it could not wait ""indefinitely"" to tighten
given long-term risks to inflation, lifting the odds of a rate
hike next month.
 In the minutes of its October meeting, the Reserve Bank of
Australia (RBA) said a case could have been made to hike this
month, and stressed that rates would ""need to rise at some
point"".
 Its hawkish stance was enough to get some investors betting
on rates rising 25 basis points from 4.5 percent at the RBA's
next policy meeting on November 2. The Australian dollar
 jumped about a third of a cent and bill futures
<0#YBA:> slid.
 ""On balance, there's probably enough to get the RBA across
the line in November if inflation comes broadly in line with
the RBA's 2.5-2.75 percent forecast for the third quarter,""
said Scott Haslem, an economist at UBS.
 ""The tone of the the RBA's comments suggests higher rates
is just a matter of time.""

 Indeed, the RBA said its decision to leave rates unchanged

meeting, which would come just after the release of
third-quarter inflation data.
 It said a year-end inflation of around 3 percent, with
underlying inflation at between 2.5-2.75 percent, would be in
line with its expectations.
 In explaining its surprise decision to not hike this month,
the RBA said it felt it had the flexibility to wait due to a
rising Australian dollar, soft domestic credit growth and a
weak global growth outlook.
 ""While the board recognised that it could not wait
indefinitely to see whether risks materialised, members judged
that they had the flexibility to do so on this occasion,"" the

 The RBA's policy decision this month caught out many
investors who saw a 75 percent chance of rates rising to 4.75
percent, in part due to the bank's hawkish remarks about how
rates have to go higher.
 That bank's surprise move burnt many rate investors and
left them wary of leaning too far on tightening bets.
 Implied rates showed the market was priced for just a 40
percent chance  of rates rising in November, a
modest rise from Monday's 36 percent.
 As some had suspected, the RBA cited the rising Australian
dollar and its tightening effect on domestic monetary
conditions as among reasons why it decided to keep policy on
hold.
 A solid domestic economy driven by rising commodity prices,
a hawkish central bank and relatively high interest rates have
helped the Australian dollar  surge nearly 11 percent
this year to above the landmark $1 for the first time since it
was freely floated in 1983.
 That ranks it as the second best-performing major currency,
after the yen.
 The RBA noted that further gains in the Australian dollar
would help temper price pressures and keep underlying inflation
within its target 2-3 percent in the near term.
 On the domestic economy, the RBA was cautiously upbeat.
 It said business investment was expected to pick up in the
next few years, and that the resilient jobs market was holding
up, although growth in labour demand may be moderating.
 It noted consumers remained cautious and that growth in
mortgage and credit card debt was slowing. The property market
was cooling as well, but it said that was welcome given the
long-term rise in house prices and household debt.
 The central bank also sounded cautiously upbeat on
developments abroad, especially with regards to Australia's top
export market China. It said recent Chinese data had been
stronger and lessened risks of a significant slowdown there.

 * Dollar in consolidation mode vs euro, soft vs yen
 * Aussie firm after RBA minutes
 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The dollar lost ground in early
Asian trade on Tuesday, giving up some of the gains scored after
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said the United States would not
engage in dollar devaluation, with players seeing limited scope
for now for significant advances.
 The greenback was soft against the yen, holding within half a
yen of its recent 15-year low, and flat against a basket of
currencies as it tried to consolidate following a small rebound
from a 10-month low set last week.
 Geithner said no country including the United States could
devalue its way to prosperity, that this was not a feasible
strategy and the United States would not engage in it, and that
the United States also needed to work hard to preserve confidence
in a strong dollar.
 Greg Gibbs, currency strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland in
Sydney, said while the comments had given the dollar a bit of a
boost, it was likely to be shortlived and the dollar would likely
be moving in familiar ranges this week.
 ""The reasons for the dollar being weaker, principally that
move towards QE, are still very valid, so any pullbacks are not
going to be enormous,"" Gibbs said.
 While the United States was not about to embark on a policy
of trying to strengthen the dollar, it was also probably no
coincidence that Geithner made such a comment after the dollar
had fallen for a couple of months, which was stirring talk of
competitive currency devaluations just when G20 leaders are
preparing to meet.
 ""So you can imagine that the U.S. might think it's time to
say or do something which helps stabilise the dollar for the near
term,"" Gibbs said.
 The dollar has fallen steeply as investors have anticipated
more quantitative easing from the Federal Reserve, and after Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday offered his most explicit signal
yet that the Fed was about to move again. The main question now
is how big the next round of QE might be.
 The dollar index was steady at 77.096. Technical analysts say
it needs to extend above its Oct. 12 high of 77.93 to signal a
short-term bottom is in place after Friday's 10-month trough of
76.144.
 The dollar was soft against the yen at 81.21 yen, edging back
toward a 15-year low of 80.88 hit last week and hovering not far
off a record low of 79.75 set in 1995.
 The euro edged up 0.3 percent to $1.3980 but was still down
from an eight-month high of $1.4161 set last week. It has support
at $1.3825 and then the Oct. 12 low of $1.3775, with resistance
around $1.40.
 The Australian dollar firmed 0.4 percent to $0.9932 from late
U.S. trading on Monday, firming after the Reserve Bank of
Australia's minutes from its on Oct. 5 meeting said the arguments
to hold or hike rates were finely balanced.
 The RBA judged it had the flexibility to keep interest rates
unchanged in October as a rising local dollar was tightening
monetary conditions, while domestic credit growth remained weak
and global growth uncertain.

1665,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2010 07:04PM ET</span>","U.S., Israel agree to develop plan to boost trade"," WASHINGTON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Top U.S. and Israeli trade
officials on Monday marked the 25th anniversary of a bilateral
free trade pact by agreeing to look at ways to expand trade in
agriculture, services and other areas.
 ""Today we met to celebrate our achievements and to lay a
course for the future,"" U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk and
Israeli Trade and Industry Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said
in a joint statement.
 The two sides agreed to develop a plan by early 2011 to
explore how to make the existing pact work better, and to make
a renewed pushed to tear down barriers to agriculture and
services trade not covered by the agreement.
 The United States and Israel also plan to negotiate a deal
easing trade in telecommunications equipment and to examine
ways to reduce red tape and other bureaucratic delays in
customs clearing procedures, they said.
 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a leading business group, on
Tuesday is hosting industry and government officials from both
countries for a day-long conference on boosting trade.
 The 1985 deal with Israel is the United States' oldest free
trade agreement, predating even the North American Free Trade
Agreement with Canada and Mexico.
 When it was implemented on Sept. 1 that year, Israel
exported about $2.7 billion worth of goods and services to the
United States and received about $3.7 billion in annual
economic and military aid.
 Under the pact, Israel's exports to the United States have
grown to around $25 billion annually, or about seven times
combined U.S. military and economic aid.
 However, the pact contains only a rudimentary chapter on
services, which is an increasingly important part of the
U.S.-Israel commercial relationship.
 Also, U.S. pressure for increased access to Israel's
agricultural market has been a sensitive topic in the past
because of the Mideast country's desire to keep its rural areas
occupied for political and national security reasons.
 The 1985 pact mainly eliminated tariffs on goods between
the two countries. That includes the $2 billion in diamonds
that New York jewelry firms imported from Israel in 2008 and
billions more in airplanes and airplane parts, semiconductors,
communication satellites, medical devices and other goods.

 NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Financial shares led U.S. and
European stock markets higher on Monday after Citigroup
reported profits while the U.S. dollar rallied late after
Washington said it would not devalue the greenback.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told investors in
Silicon Valley that China's currency, the yuan, remains
significantly undervalued even after Beijing has allowed more
flexibility in its exchange rate regime.
 ""It is very important for people to understand that the

 Citigroup Inc , whose near-death experience in the
financial crisis required three different taxpayer rescues,
pulled out a third straight quarterly profit. The results
cheered up investors, at least temporarily, with growing
concerns over the potential exposure major banks have to

 * Want permanent crisis resolution mechanism
 * Paris, Berlin want EU members' proposals by March

(Adds quotes, details)
 By Jan Strupczewski and John Irish
 LUXEMBOURG/DEAUVILLE, Oct 18 (Reuters) - France and Germany
called on European Union member states on Monday to draw up
proposals by next March for a permanent system to handle crises
in the euro zone and said it would mean changing the EU treaty.
 A joint statement issued by French President Nicolas Sarkozy
and German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a summit in France said
they also agreed that the private sector should be involved in
the system, intended to resolve problems like the sovereign debt
crisis that hit Greece this year.
 They called for proposals to be submitted before an EU
summit next March, signalling a desire to speed up the process.
The executive European Commission has called for countries to
come up with ideas in the latter part of 2011.
 ""We have to move forward because in 2013 the rescue funds
for the euro will end, so we need a more lasting rescue
mechanism,"" Merkel told a news conference in the northern French
port of Deauville.
 The two biggest countries in the euro zone agreed on the
need for changes to EU law to make it possible to suspend the
voting rights of an EU country which seriously violates the
principles of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
 ""Financial sanctions are limited. If there is a situation
like Greece, is there any sense in imposing a fine? However,
there is sense if you ban a state from voting on a raft of (key)
EU decisions,"" a French source close to the talks said.
 The euro zone has 16 members, to be joined by Estonia next
year.
 The necessary amendments to the EU treaty should be adopted
and ratified by member states before 2013, the French/German
statement said.
 ""We are conscious of the reluctance to amend the treaties as
a whole,"" the French source said. ""What we are proposing is a
surgical revision. We don't want it to open a debate on the
constitution or the union.""
 Changes to the EU treaty have to be ratified by all 27 EU
member states, some of which have resisted such changes.
 EU finance ministers, carrying out a general overhaul of the
bloc's fiscal rulebook in Luxembourg, were discussing how far to
commit themselves to creating a permanent mechanism for crisis
resolution in the euro zone.
 The changes to the budget rules, outlined in the Stability
and Growth Pact, are the biggest overhaul of the fiscal rules
underpinning the euro since its creation in 1999 and are meant
to prevent another Greek-style sovereign debt crisis.
 The euro zone has so far agreed on ad hoc solutions for
emergency financing -- an 80 billion euro ($112 billion)
bilateral loan package for Greece and a 500 billion euro
European Financial Stability Mechanism for all euro zone states.
 Both mechanisms expire in 2013.
 According to a draft proposal prepared for EU finance
ministers last week, a permanent crisis resolution mechanism
would have to involve strong conditions for any aid to be given,
with terms and conditions similar to those imposed by the
International Monetary Fund.
 It would also involve the private sector and the IMF,
address the issue of moral hazard, strengthen incentives to
pursue sound fiscal policy and respect the independence of the
European Central Bank, the draft said.
 ""The mechanism is a problem due to the no-bailout clause,""
the French source said. ""We (France and Germany) want it to be
permanent on an uncontested judicial base... so the treaty must
be changed,"" he said.

should unite behind the government's 2011 budget that includes
drastic spending cuts, the chairman of the group of euro zone
finance ministers said on Monday.
 The opposition Social Democrats have declined to say whether
they will give the unpopular government the support it needs to
pass the budget.
 ""We do hope that the major parties will join in making these
efforts so that the Portuguese parliament will adopt the budget
for 2011,"" Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker told a news
conference.
 He was speaking after European Union finance ministers
agreed on Monday that member states should face almost automatic
sanctions for breaching EU deficit and debt limits.
 Portugal's minority Socialist government included deep
spending cuts and tax increases in the 2011 budget that it
presented last week, but must win the support of the opposition
for the bill to pass in parliament.
 Portugal announced spending cuts in May but then came under
pressure from financial markets and Brussels to do more.
 The government has targeted a deficit of 7.3 percent of GDP
this year and 4.6 percent next year. 
 ""The governments in (Greece, Ireland and Portugal) will be
able to meet the fiscal targets with the consolidation measures
that they have taken and they are also taking very substantial
efforts in structural reforms,"" European Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn told reporters.
 The risk premiums on Portuguese bonds hit euro lifetime
highs at the end of last month on concerns about its ability to
cut the budget deficit
 The spreads have narrowed to their tightest levels in nearly
two months but failure to pass the budget could send them up
again, making it more onerous for the government to borrow on
international markets.

people
 * President Jacob Zuma, businessmen to visit, push ties
 
 By Dina Zayed and Alexander Dziadosz
 CAIRO, Oct 18 (Reuters) - African countries need to boost
regional trade and investment to keep pace with growth in other
emerging economies that have large consumer bases, such as India
and China, South Africa's trade chief said on Monday.
 Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies, in Cairo for a
high-level, bilateral state visit to the continent's second
biggest economy, said Egypt and South Africa were trying to seal
a Cape-to-Cairo free trade agreement that could help reduce
dependence on flagging European economies.
 ""The fact of the matter is we don't as single countries
begin to touch the sizes of the domestic market of China and
India, but as a grouping from Cape-to-Cairo we do start to hit
that league,"" Davies told Reuters in an interview.
 Africa boasts some 30 regional trade arrangements, but the
continent receives less than 4 percent of global foreign direct
investment, in part because small markets often cannot attract
big money and because onerous bureaucratic requirements tend to
discourage foreign business.
 Widespread corruption is another hindrance.
 South Africa, faced with a strengthening rand that has hit
its main export and manufacturing sectors, is eager to diversify
trade with emerging markets, particularly as ""seismic changes in
the world economy"" make it more pressing, Davies said.
 The agreement is being pushed by COMESA, the 19-country
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, which includes
Egypt, and by SADC, the 15-country Southern African Development
Community, and the East African common market.
 A pact could cover 700 million people from the world's
poorest continent, Davies said.
 Exports from sub-Saharan countries to one another accounted
for 11 percent of their total outbound trade by 2006, according
to the United Nations trade body UNCTAD, compared to 46 percent
among the states of emerging Asia and 71 percent for developed
Europe.
 Analysts have said freer and greater trade between African
states will stimulate local economic growth and create jobs by
attracting more domestic and foreign investment and by cutting
reliance on expensive external imports. 
 ""We see that emerging markets and developing countries are
becoming the growth forces and the new poles of economic power
and the ones that are making headway are also the ones that have
sizeable internal markets,"" Davies said.
 South African President Jacob Zuma will visit Cairo on
Tuesday with more than 100 South African businessmen, including
executives from power utility Eskom, national oil company
PetroSA and several ministers.
 South Africa's exports to Egypt were a modest 1.2 billion
rand ($175 million) and its imports 231.3 million rand in 2009.
This compares to 48.7 billion rand of exports and 70.8 billion
of imports with China, their single biggest trading partner, in
the same year.
 ""The new prospects are in emerging markets. The fact of the
matter is we are in that category, Egypt is in that category,""
Davies said, adding that interest was in energy, agro-processing
and tourism ventures.
 Egypt's Trade and Industry Minister Rachid Mohamed Rachid is
expected to visit South Africa by mid-February to continue talks
started in Cairo this week, Davies added.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was little
changed against the euro on Monday, erasing early gains, and
under pressure from uncertainty over the size of further
monetary policy easing by the Federal Reserve.
 The dollar climbed as high as around 1.3830 per euro
overnight as a wave of profit-taking that began on Friday
continued into Monday. But the euro has since recovered after a
breach of the $1.3850 level wasn't sustained.
 Despite an overall bearish sentiment on the dollar,
analysts said the downside looked limited as short dollar
positions were extended and the euro faced strong resistance at
$1.40.
 Investors are more certain there will be further easing
after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday offered his most
explicit signal yet the U.S. central bank was set to relax
monetary policy further. The question now is the amount. For
details, see
 ""After the news came out that the Fed most likely will be
engaging in some quantitative easing next month people took
that as a sign to finish out their short dollar trades,"" said
Brendan McGrath, manager of business solutions at Custom House,
a Western Union company, in Victoria, British Columbia.
 In late trading, the euro was 0.1 percent higher at
$1.3994, but down from a more than eight-month high of $1.4161,
hit on trading platform EBS on Friday. The session low on
Monday was $1.3830 on EBS.
 Next downside targets are technical support at $1.3825 and
then the Oct. 12 low of $1.3775. On the upside, traders said
gains in the euro may be limited unless the currency can
consistently close above the pivotal $1.40 mark.
 Adding to strength in the euro was a narrowing of spreads
between 10-year U.S. and German yields in favor of the single
currency, analysts said.
 QE PRICED IN?
 The dollar index was down 0.1 percent at 76.947, after
rising to 77.645. The rally needs to extend above its Oct. 12
high of 77.93 to signal a short-term bottom is in place after
Friday's 10-month trough of 76.144, analysts said.
 The index has lost more than 5 percent in the past month as
investors increased their bets against the dollar on heightened
expectations for the Fed to unveil a second round of
quantitative easing.
 Atlanta Federal Reserve bank president Dennis Lockhart said
on Monday the U.S. economy is weak enough to warrant further
monetary easing by the Fed, though such a policy carries risks
and should not be taken lightly.
 This added to calls by two more Fed officials over the
weekend, who joined Bernanke in arguing for further aggressive
action as U.S. inflation unexpectedly slowed in September even
as retail sales picked up.
 With much of the impact of additional easing already priced
in, analysts cautioned of the risk of a dollar rebound if the
Fed announces asset purchases of less than $1 trillion or takes
a more gradual approach after its November meeting.
 ""People priced in a little bit too quickly how much the Fed
was going to do and now people are a little bit nervous about
the magnitude,"" said Mark McCormick, currency strategist at
Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed speculators trimmed bets against the dollar in the
latest week but still had hefty wagers against it.
 The dollar ceded ground against the yen, falling 0.3
percent to 81.18 yen and edging back toward a 15-year low of
80.88 hit on EBS last week. Traders reported sovereign demand
around the 81.15 level.
 The Australian dollar recovered from losses to last trade
up 0.3 percent at $0.9932. The Aussie rose to $1.0004 on
Friday, the highest since floatation in 1983.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was little
changed against the euro on Monday, erasing early gains, and
under pressure from the uncertainty arising over the size of
further monetary policy easing from the Federal Reserve.
 The downside for the dollar looked limited from here,
however, as short dollar positions were extended and the euro
faced strong resistance at $1.40, analysts said.
 Investors are more certain there will be more easing after
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday offered his
most explicit signal yet that the U.S. central bank was set to
ease monetary policy further though the question remains the
amount. For details, see [ID:nN15187998]
 ""After the news (Bernanke comments) came out that the Fed
most likely will be engaging in some quantitative easing next
month, people took that as a sign to finish out their short
dollar trades,"" said Brendan McGrath, manager of business
solutions at Custom House, a Western Union company, in
Victoria, British Columbia.
 The euro was 0.1 percent higher on the day at $1.3988
, but down from a more than eight-month high of $1.4161,
hit on trading platform EBS on Friday . The session
low on Monday was $1.3830 on EBS.
 Next downside targets are technical support at $1.3825 and
then the Oct. 12 low of $1.3775.
 Traders said much of the day's action in the euro was
technical after the breach of the $1.3850 level wasn't
sustained. The rise from the low began in London trading.
 Analysts also cited a narrowing of spreads between 10-year
U.S. and German yields in favor of the euro.
 Investors ""have not really changed their positive
underlying view of the euro,"" said Joseph Trevisani, chief
market analyst at FX Solutions in Saddle River, New Jersey.
 Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed speculators trimmed bets against the dollar in the
latest week but still had hefty wagers against it. [IMM/FX]

 The dollar index <.DXY> was little changed at 77.032, after
rising to 77.645. The rally needs to extend above its Oct. 12
high of 77.93 to signal a short-term bottom is in place after
Friday's 10-month trough of 76.144, analysts said.
 The index has lost nearly 5 percent in the past month as
investors increased their bets against the dollar on heightened
market expectations for the Federal Reserve to unveil a second
round of quantitative easing as early as November.
 Atlanta Federal Reserve bank president Dennis Lockhart said
on Monday, the U.S. economy is weak enough to warrant further
monetary easing by the Federal Reserve, though such a policy
carries risks and should not be taken lightly.[ID:nN18167666]
 This compounded the calls by two more Fed officials over
the weekend, who joined Bernanke in arguing for further
aggressive action as U.S. inflation unexpectedly slowed in
September even as retail sales picked up.[ID:nN16208445]
 The dollar ceded ground against the yen, falling 0.3
percent to 81.21 yen  and edging back toward a 15-year
low of 80.88 hit on EBS last week . Traders reported
sovereign demand around the 81.15 level.
 The Australian dollar recovered from the day's declines and
was last up 0.1 percent to $0.9915 . The Aussie rose to
$1.0004 on Friday, but hit a low of $0.9801 on Monday after
some macro funds sold, with traders citing decent stop-loss
orders at $0.9780.

 * Reforms intended to prevent sovereign debt crises
(Adds quotes, details)
 By Marcin Grajewski and Annika Breidthardt
 LUXEMBOURG, Oct 18 (Reuters) - European Union finance
ministers agreed on Monday on how to toughen the bloc's budget
rules to prevent sovereign debt crises, and said rule breakers
would face sanctions only six months after being warned.
The reform of the rules that underpin the euro was based on a
deal reached by the French and German leaders, and is intended
to stave off any repeat of the debt problems in Greece this year
which threatened the future of the single currency.
""Today, the European Union made a great step forward in ...
economic governance,"" EU President Herman van Rompuy said after
EU finance ministers met in Luxembourg. 
 ""The package agreed ... will be the biggest reform of the
Economic and Monetary Union since the euro was created.""
 He will present the deal for approval by the leaders of the
the 27-country bloc at an EU summit in Brussels next week.
 The ministers agreed the EU executive, the European
Commission, will monitor national economies to detect problems
such as real estate bubbles, unsustainable balance of payments
trends or strong divergences in competitiveness.
 If an excessive imbalance develops and a euro zone country
does not change the policies which led to it, it could
ultimately face sanctions.
 The ministers agreed to apply new sanctions -- and to do so
more quickly -- on euro zone countries which do not move towards
a budget close to balance or in surplus, run budget deficits
above 3 percent of GDP or debt higher than 60 percent of GDP.
 
 NEW, SWIFTER SANCTIONS
 Sanctions -- which would begin with an interest-bearing
deposit, changing into a non-interest bearing deposit and
ultimately into a fine -- would kick in six months after a
country was warned by the European Commission.
 Under the current rules, financial sanctions await a euro
zone country only at the end of a long disciplinary process
which could take years. By this time, a fine could make things
worse for a cash-strapped country.
 To reduce ministerial discretion in deciding sanctions -- an
issue which triggered a revision of the EU budget rules in 2005
-- the penalties could be stopped only by a qualified majority
of EU ministers, the ministers agreed.
 The agreement was based on a deal struck by the euro zone's
two biggest economies -- Germany and France -- whose leaders
Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy announced its main elements
after a meeting in the French city of Deauville.
 ""The agreement between Germany and France was the basis for
tonight's (finance ministers') agreement,"" German Deputy Finance
Minister Joerg Asmussen told a news briefing in Luxembourg.
 He said the agreement was approved without dissenting votes.
 Some ministers suggested before the talks that enthusiasm
for change was waning as Europe's economy recovers from the
financial crisis, despite lingering concern over the Irish,
Greek and Portuguese economies. 
 Merkel and Sarkozy urged EU states to draw up proposals by
March for creating a permanent system to handle crises in the
euro zone and said it would mean changing the EU treaty.
 
 WORK AHEAD
 The two biggest countries in the euro zone also said the
changes to EU law should enable a suspension of the voting
rights of a euro zone country which seriously violated the
principles of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
 In their agreement, the finance ministers said the precise
details would be worked out later on how a system for resolving
crises in the euro zone would work.
 The 16-country euro area has in place only ad-hoc solutions
for emergency financing -- an 80 billion euro ($112 billion)
bilateral loan package for Greece and a 500 billion euro
European Financial Stability Mechanism for all euro zone states.
 Another change is that governments will submit early budget
drafts for the scrutiny of the Commission and other EU countries
before they are voted into law by national parliaments.
 The European Commission wants the new rules to be in place
by mid-2011 but the chairman of euro zone finance ministers,
Jean-Claude Juncker, said 2012 was a more likely start date.
 ING economist Carsten Brzeski said that while the market
impact of a deal on the EU budget rules would still be smaller
than a U.S. labour market report, the outcome of Monday's talks
could contribute to the overall sentiment towards the euro zone.
 He said ""a strong commitment tonight ... would clearly
contribute to confidence in the euro zone.""

 NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Wall Street rose on Monday
after an upbeat earnings report from Citigroup, while the U.S.
dollar held steady as investors dialed back expectations for
aggressive policy easing from the Federal Reserve.
 European financial shares were also given a boost on news
Royal Bank of Canada has agreed to buy UK-based fund manager
BlueBay Asset Management  at a 29 percent premium above
Friday's closing price.
 Comments from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday resonated
into the new week, cementing the view that more quantitative
easing would take place, but the assumptions for large amounts
of stimulus appear to be fraying.
 Spot gold tacked on a few pennies but held just under its
all-time high of $1,387.10 while crude oil prices advanced 2

 ""The dollar's move down has been extremely aggressive, and

2,469.90.
 For now, investor focus on worries over the potential
exposure of major banks to foreclosure losses is shifting to
the background.
 ""Financials have tried to weather the storm from the last
couple of days, today helped by Citigroup,"" said Steve Goldman,
market strategist at Weeden & Co in Greenwich, Connecticut.
 He said investors are gauging if the foreclosure mess is
""really going to affect lending or it is a concentrated issue

 In addition to Bernanke's comments, two Fed officials
joined in over the weekend, arguing for further aggressive
action as U.S. inflation unexpectedly slowed in September even
as retail sales picked up.
 Quantitative easing effectively requires the Fed to print
more money, thus increasing supply and keeping interest rates
at unattractively low levels.
 The euro regained its footing, but added just 0.05 at
$1.3983 , still off last week's 8-1/2 month high. The
greenback fell 0.32 percent to 81.17 yen , edging back

1683,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2010 12:56PM ET</span>",UPDATE 3-Sawiris loses Wind Hellas as bondholders take over," * Wind Hellas to be sold after second debt restructuring
 * Senior secured bondholders preferred bidders for Wind

(Adds more detail, background)
 By Sarah White
 LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Naguib Sawiris, the Egyptian
tycoon trying to sell assets to Russian group Vimpelcom, is to
lose control of Greek telecom business Wind Hellas after
creditors emerged as the preferred bidders on Monday.
 Bondholders will take over Wind Hellas in a debt-for-equity
swap, a blow for Sawiris who retained control of the group in a
first restructuring last year.
 But he failed to gain the support of creditors after the
group was hit once again this year by the turmoil in the Greek
economy and an industry price war, despite tabling an offer for
the company alongside five other bidders.
 Senior secured bondholders -- who were owed more than 1.2
billion euros ($1.67 billion) -- will inject 420 million euros
into the company in return for control of the group, parent
company Weather Finance III said.
 The sale of Wind Hellas will further shrink the empire of
the Egyptian billionaire, still trying to sell his holdings in
Wind and Orascom to Vimpelcom for $6.6 billion.
 The Vimpelcom transaction is complicated by uncertainty over
Orascom's Algerian unit Djezzy, the company's biggest revenue
earner which Algiers has said it wants to nationalise following
a row over back taxes. ""The Timing was wrong for Naguib. He
would have been a more credible bidder for Wind Hellas if he had
cash in hand from the Vimpelcom deal,"" a person familiar with
the matter said. 
 Russian president Dmitry Medvedev failed to get a public
pledge from Algeria earlier this month that Djezzy would be part
of the proposed deal between Vimpelcom and Sawiris.
 Algeria has since started interviewing potential advisers to
help nationalise the contested unit..
 Sawiris could not immediately be reached for comment.
 
 SECOND PRE-PACK
 As part of the takeover, lenders to a 250 million euro
revolving credit facility are set to be paid with the cash
injection, while senior secured bondholders will write off their
claims in exchange for 100 percent of the equity in Wind Hellas.
 Senior unsecured bondholders -- at the bottom of the
creditor hierarchy and who are owed 355 million euros -- will
also have to write off their loans as part of the deal.
 The firm will change hands in a pre-packaged administration,
two sources close to the matter said. This is a pre-agreed sale
mechanism via which a company can be sold on, minus some debt.
 It mirrors the process used by Sawiris last year when Wind
Hellas's sale became the UK's biggest pre-pack and a 1.1 billion
euro layer of debt was cut out. 
 That deal, possible because Wind Hellas's parent company at
the time had an office in London, resulted in out-of-pocket
lenders blasting the UK as a ""bankruptcy brothel"". 
 This time, more than 75 percent of senior secured
bondholders supported the bid put forward by a noteholder
committee controlling big chunks of the debt, clearing the
approval threshold.
 Six specialist distressed debt investors -- Mount Kellett
Capital Partners, Taconic Capital Advisers, Providence Equity
Capital Markets, Anchorage Capital Group, Angelo Gordon and Eton
Park International -- made up the committee and have
underwritten the bondholder offer and new money.
 Weather said on Monday that new board members -- senior
telecom executives and members of the Greek business community
-- would be appointed at Wind Hellas, while Nassos Zarkalis
would continue as chief executive.
 Norwegian telecom Telenor was also one of the six bidders
and had made an offer with a cash component, sources told
Reuters last week. The remaining bidders included two Greek
peers and U.S. private equity firm Saban Capital.

1685,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2010 12:04PM ET</span>",FUND VIEW-Tiberius prefers palladium to other precious metals," * Palladium top pick of precious complex
 * Says taking profits on palladium position
 * Neutral on gold, sees U.S. dollar as key driver
 
 By Amanda Cooper
 LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Commodity fund Tiberius Asset
Management prefers palladium over the rest of the precious
metals in light of its strong fundamental backdrop and says
sister metal platinum is also poised for more gains.
 Thomas Benedix, who helps manage the $1.7 billion stable of
commodity funds at Swiss-based Tiberius, says that even though
the company has recently pared back its holdings of palladium,
the metal is best placed to benefit from a recovering global
economy.
 Palladium, which is primarily used in catalytic converters
and depends largely on demand from gasoline-powered vehicles,
has risen by more than 40 percent so far this year to around
$580 an ounce to rank as one of 2010's top-performing
commodities.
 ""Palladium probably still has the best fundamentals among
the precious metals in terms of supply and demand. We see a
market deficit in palladium for 2011 and still good growth rates
in emerging markets, which palladium is exposed to through
gasoline catalysts,"" Benedix said.
""We've been overweight in palladium and have recently
reduced it as it has had a very good run,"" Benedix said, adding:
""It's profit-taking, rather than a fundamental change in view.""
 Palladium's outperformance relative to platinum recently
rose to its best in six years, thanks to its reliance on the
growing share of emerging markets such as China of the global
auto sector. Platinum's use in catalysts for diesel engines,
which are largely used in the flagging European car market,
means it has suffered accordingly.
 An ounce of platinum costs less than three ounces of
palladium and at less than two ounces, palladium starts to look
unattractive to the carmakers, and this ratio is coming under
increasing scrutiny, Benedix said.
 
 NO MORE LAGGING
 Platinum, which is up 15 percent so far this year and
trading just below $1,700 an ounce, has lagged gold, silver and
palladium in the last three months.
 But Benedix said the metal's restricted supply makes a
compelling case for this underperformance to reverse.
 Output in top supplier South Africa is constantly at the
mercy of power outages from the country's ageing electricity
grid and from frequent strike action by workers employed in some
of the world's deepest mines.
 Meanwhile, the 7 percent appreciation in the rand against
the U.S. dollar this year is putting additional pressure on
local producers who find their product less profitable on the
international markets, where it is quoted in dollars.
 ""We feel platinum has some potential to at least not
underperform palladium going forward,"" Benedix said.
 Tiberius has a fairly optimistic outlook for the global
economy, even if it does anticipate more dollar weakness and
more investor unease in the months to come.
 With that in mind, it remains neutral in gold, which is
trading near record highs above $1,380 an ounce, and underweight
in silver.
 ""There is a lot of fear in the markets, as well, of both
inflation and deflation. If these fears subside a little bit,
then we think gold could lose a little of its safe-haven
appeal,"" Benedix said.
 ""Then, in the longer term, we're not outright economic
bulls. We do see some deflationary pressure out of the U.S.
Again, we think more will depend on the emerging markets going
forward, how the China story plays out in 2011, we don't know.""

with the euro retreating from an 8-1/2-month high and the
Australian dollar  down from Friday's peak above
parity, the currency's highest level since it was floated in
1983.
 Traders said short-term speculation and model accounts and
Asian central banks were active in the session as the euro fell
as low as $1.3830. Next downside targets are technical support
at $1.3825 and then the Oct. 12 low of $1.3775.

 Comments from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday resonated
into the new week, cementing the view that more quantitative
easing would take place, but the assumptions for large amounts
of stimulus appear to be fraying.
 Commodity prices were flat as gold hovered under record
highs, nearly unchanged on the day, while crude oil prices
advanced 1.6 percent.
 ""It is a continuation from Friday,"" said Chuck Butler,
president of EverBank World Markets in St. Louis. ""Now everyone
knows (quantitative easing) is going to happen we are seeing
some profit taking in the euro/dollar and commodities.""
 Investors also trimmed bets against the dollar ahead of a
forthcoming Group of 20 rich and developing nations meeting and
before hedge funds' book closings at the end of November,
analysts said.
 In mid-morning New York trade, the Dow Jones industrial
average <.DJI> rose 48.71 points, or 0.44 percent, at
11,111.49. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> gained 3.61
points, or 0.31 percent, at 1,179.80. The Nasdaq Composite
Index <.IXIC> climbed 3.75 points, or 0.15 percent, at

 For now, investor focus on worries over the potential
exposure of major banks to foreclosure losses is shifting to
the background.
 ""Financials have tried to weather the storm from the last
couple of days, today helped by Citigroup,"" said Steve Goldman,
market strategist at Weeden & Co in Greenwich, Connecticut.
 He said investors are gauging if the foreclosure mess is
""really going to affect lending or it is a concentrated issue
and not an economic issue.""
 Citigroup Inc  shares rose 3 percent, to $4.07,
putting a bid under bank shares, after it reported a third
consecutive quarterly profit, slightly beating Wall Street's
forecasts. For details see [ID:nN18138072].

 MSCI's emerging market stock benchmark <.MSCIEF> fell 0.94
percent on Monday after hitting a 2-1/2-year high last week.
Gains in U.S. and European markets meant the MSCI All-Country
World index <.MIWD00000PUS> was flat.
 CURRENCIES
 The dollar edged up against a basket of currencies made up
of its major trading partners <.DXY>, rising 0.05 percent.
 In addition to Bernanke's comments, two Fed officials
joined in over the weekend, arguing for further aggressive
action as U.S. inflation unexpectedly slowed in September even
as retail sales picked up.
 Quantitative easing effectively requires the Fed to print
more money, thus increasing supply and keeping interest rates
at unattractively low levels.
 The euro fell 0.16 percent at $1.3953 , retreating
further from last week's 8-1/2 month high. However the
greenback fell 0.23 percent to 81.24 yen , edging back
towards a 15-year low of 80.88 hit on EBS last week.
 On Monday September's reading of U.S. industrial production
fell unexpectedly.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury  rose 14/32
of a point in price, driving the yield down to 2.51 percent.
 ""This looks like a retracement,"" said Jim Vogel, interest
rate strategist at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee. ""The
momentum behind the inflation trade kind of faded.""
 In Europe, the December Bund future  was down 11
ticks at 130.62. The 10-year Bund yield  was flat
at 2.38 percent, sending the 2/10 year yield spread to 150 bps,
its tightest since Oct. 14.
 The dollar's rebound has caused commodity investors to hit
the pause button on their purchases.
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  rose $1.23 to $82.48 per
barrel, and spot gold prices  rose $2.70 to $1370.80.

 * Baer will not comment
 * Switzerland seeking to tie up key tax deal with Germany
 
 FRANKFURT/ZURICH, Oct 18 (Reuters) - German prosecutors paid
around 1.5 million euros ($2.1 million) for client data from
Swiss bank Julius Baer, part of its two-pronged campaign to
clamp down on untaxed German wealth held in Switzerland.
 A spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office in the German city
of Muenster said on Monday the state of North Rhine Westphalia
had bought a CD containing 200 sets of data.
 The purchase happened earlier this summer and the proceeds
had been donated to a charity, the spokeswoman said.
 Baer spokesman Martin Somogyi would not comment.
 Germany, along with Italy, the United States and France, has
been one of the most fervent critics of Switzerland's banking
secrecy laws and has paid in the past for stolen data from Swiss
banks in order to catch tax cheats.
The pressure has already prompted Switzerland to relax its
cherished bank secrecy and comply with international disclosure
standards.
 Germany and Switzerland are also seeking to finalise a deal
by the end of October that will clarify tax disclosure rules for
Switzerland's multi-trillion-dollar wealth management industry.

 The aim is to resolve the problem of an estimated 200
billion euros of untaxed German wealth hidden in Switzerland.
 In July, German prosecutors raided every Credit Suisse
office in Germany after an analysis of a compact disc with
names of 1,500 alleged tax dodgers obtained by tax authorities.

 A bitter dispute between the U.S. tax authorities and UBS
damaged the Swiss industry's reputation and forced the banking
giant to agree to hand over the names of about 4,450 clients to
Washington.
 In 2008, Germany paid for data stolen from Liechtenstein's
top bank LGT. Former Deutsche Post chief Klaus Zumwinkel's
Liechtenstein trust was uncovered in that data. He received a
suspended jail sentence after admitting tax evasion.
 Since the Credit Suisse client CD fell into the hands of tax
authorities in Germany, more than 10,000 people have confessed
to evading taxes to state authorities, German media have said.
 Under German law, those who report undeclared income
themselves and pay back tax plus interest owed before an
investigation is started are exempt from prosecution.

 * But UK easing concerns overshadowed by dollar weakness
 * Technicals favour euro over pound, next target 90 pence
 * Volatility rising; Oct spending review in focus
 
 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Sterling is seen holding ground
against an ailing dollar in coming months but may lag the euro
and other currencies on persistent speculation the Bank of
England will ease policy further to aid a faltering economy.
 Expectations for more stimulus grew after the U.S. Federal
Reserve indicated it was ready for more quantitative easing and
Monetary Policy Committee member Adam Posen suggested he would
vote for an expansion of the BoE's asset-buying programme.
 UK finance minister George Osborne has also said he will
sanction more QE if the central bank sees it as necessary.
 For the pound, the way forward seems twofold.
 Expectations the Fed will loosen monetary policy next month
mean it is expected to hold recent gains against the dollar, but
the UK currency may struggle against the euro after the European
Central Bank signalled an end to its special liquidity measures.
 Having breached a key level of $1.60, analysts expect
sterling to hold near that level over the next three months, but
slip to as little as 90 pence against the euro.
 ""We have been bullish on the pound for three reasons: the
more proactive fiscal stance of the government, relative
monetary policy and valuation on a purchasing power parity
basis, as the pound is now the most undervalued currency in the
G10,"" said Barclays Capital currency strategist Raghav Subbarao.
 Purchasing power parity refers to a theory that estimates
the amount of adjustment needed in an exchange rate in order for
purchasing power to be equivalent in each currency.
 Barclays forecasts the pound to trade around $1.61 by
year-end. It hit a 8-month high of $1.6108 on Friday.
 Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows
currency speculators have reversed bets against sterling and
were positioned for the currency's advance.

 Graphic on sterling positioning
http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/10/GLB_IMMGBP0510.jpg
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 In the options market, one-month risk-reversals for
sterling/dollar have come back to be fairly neutral at around
0.40 from 0.90 before the September Fed meeting, indicating
market players have scaled back near-term bets on the pound
falling.
 
 VOLATILITY
 Near-term implied volatility is seen stabilising, reducing
the risk of further downside, analysts say. However, three-month
sterling/dollar implied volatility suggests traders may be
bracing for some weakness going into year-end.
 On Monday, three-month vols were seen around 11.35 compared
with one-month vols around 11.00.
 Market players will be watching the government's spending
review on Oct. 20, which will detail plans to cut a record
budget deficit to almost nil in five years, while the BoE will
unveil its latest quarterly projections for the economy and
prices in November. Monetary policy is expected to remain loose.
 ""Sterling has been a strong laggard in the G10,"" said Pierre
Lequeux, head of currency management at Aviva Investors in
London. ""The direction will be driven more by QE than anything
else but it is not clear what that will be.""
 Meanwhile, the euro is expected to keep the upper hand over
the pound, given the ECB's more hawkish monetary policy outlook.
 ""The euro/sterling pair continues to rise, with a next
target of 88.65 pence and then to the 90 area,"" said Ian
Stannard, senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas.
 But others say euro gains may be limited to around 86 pence
over the next three months as the pound proves resilient against
the dollar.
 Analysts said Britain has little incentive to join in the
'currency war', as some have labelled attempts by some countries
to weaken their currencies, as trade-weighted sterling is moving
lower. The index fell some 2 percent against a basket of
currencies in the third quarter.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 TWI FX moves since 2007 http://r.reuters.com/qun86p
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 The domestic economic picture remains mixed, with higher
inflation and improvement in jobs countered by a weakening
housing market and lower consumer confidence. The economy faces
potential headwinds from a rise in the value-added tax early
next year and the fiscal spending cuts.
 Monetary policy remains loose but most analysts say the
central bank will not be in a rush to take further easing steps,
especially as inflation remains above its 2 percent target and
as one policymaker has continued to vote for higher rates.
 ""Whereas the Bank of Japan has moved to loosen and the Fed
will probably add more stimulus, we believe the MPC will not
expand QE further unless the UK economy weakens significantly,""
said Michael Saunders, economist at Citi.
 ""The hurdle for further action is much higher.""

 * Nordea sees next hike more likely after autumn holidays
 
 COPENHAGEN, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The persistent weakness of
the Danish crown despite an interest rate hike last week could
mean Denmark's central bank will raise rates again soon,
analysts said on Monday.
 The Nationalbank raised its certificates of deposit rate,
seen as its key rate for now, by 10 basis points to 0.60 percent
and its current account rate by 10 bps to 0.50 percent on Oct.
14 to bolster the crown. It kept its main lending rate steady at
1.05 percent.
 It was Denmark's first tightening of policy in two years,
and followed a significant weakening of the crown over the
previous month to levels above 7.45 to the euro.
 The crown rallied briefly after the move but has since
weakened back above levels seen before the hike, at one point
approaching 7.46 and trading at 7.4567 to the euro <.EURDKK=> as
of 1312 GMT.
 ""The risk of a rate rise has increased, and it could come on
Thursday,"" Danske Markets senior analyst John Hydeskov said.
 ""We learned two things last week: They (the bank) have a
shorter fuse than we had reckoned with, and Thursday at 4 p.m.
is their preferred time for rate changes,"" Hydeskov said.
 The central bank's mandate is to keep the crown steady
within a narrow band around a central parity rate of 7.46038 to
the euro. It intervenes in the market to buy or sell crowns to
strengthen or weaken the currency, but when that proves
ineffective, it changes interest rates.
 Nordea Markets senior analyst Troels Theill Eriksen said:
""There is still some way to central parity, so there is still
room for manoeuvre, but definitely, if this continues, we will
see some action from the central bank.""
 Eriksen said autumn holidays in Denmark this week make a
further rate increase less likely right away but not impossible,
Eriksen said.
 The next tightening is expected to come in the form of
another hike in the certificates of deposit (CD) rate. 
 Analysts say this rate has effectively become the bank's
main policy tool for now because banks are depositing money
rather than borrowing due to an abundance of liquidity, meaning
the lending rate does not have its usual policy effect. 
 They say the first increase in the lending rate is still
many months away.
 The crown's recent weakening is attributed to an
exceptional, negative spread in short-term market interest rates
between Denmark and the euro zone.
 ""In the really short end, the rate spread is still
negative,"" Eriksen said. ""It has closed on a three-month horizon
but it is still negative on a one-month horizon.""
 The one-month Danish Cita rate  was at 0.693 percent
on Monday, below the one-month Eonia rate  of 0.745
percent.
 The negative gap is explained by a rise in European
short-term market rates due to the rolling back of European
liquidity measures.
 ""Short money market rates in Europe are rising, and Danish
rates are not keeping up the pace, so there is still a negative
spread between Denmark and European money market rates,""
Hydeskov said.
 ""It has become less attractive for investors to hold
crowns,"" Hydeskov added.
 ""One cannot say that the crown is seriously under pressure.
It is still below central parity ... but last Thursday we saw
that they (the central bank) do not have much tolerance when it
comes to outflows of the crown,"" Hydeskov said.

 * China, Japan raise Treasury buying; overall inflow slips
(Adds detail from report, comment, byline)
 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Foreigners were heavy buyers
of long-term U.S. securities in August and nearly tripled
purchases of U.S. government debt, the U.S. Treasury Department
said on Monday.
 Net purchases of long-dated securities swelled to $128.7
billion in August from $61.2 billion the prior month.
 Overseas investors poured most of that into U.S.
Treasuries, snapping up a net $117.1 billion. That was the most
since November and far above July's total of $30 billion.
 China, the biggest buyer of U.S. Treasury debt, raised its
total holdings by $21.7 billion to $868.4 billion. Japan, the
No. 2 Treasury holder, bought a net $15.6 billion in August,
bringing its total to $836.6 billion.
 Treasuries rallied sharply in August after the Federal
Reserve hinted it could buy more Treasury debt to push down
interest rates and jolt a sluggish U.S. economy back to life.
 The Fed bought some $300 billion in U.S. Treasury debt in
2009 and more than $1 trillion in mortgage-backed securities in
a first round of what markets call ""quantitative easing.""
 Win Thin, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers
Harriman, said much of the buying was tied to fear in early
August that the United States might be heading for a double-dip
recession and then by expectations that the Fed would try to
prevent that with a second dash of quantitative easing.
 ""The bottom line is the money kept flowing into the long
end as you would expect, though people did lighten up on the
short end,"" he said.
 Net overall inflows, which include short-dated securities
such as Treasury bills, slipped to $38.9 billion in August from
a downwardly revised $63.3 billion, the data showed.
 LOOKING AHEAD
 Analysts said foreigners likely remained enthusiastic
Treasury buyers in September, as central banks increased
intervention in the foreign exchange market to prevent their
currencies from rising too quickly against a falling dollar.
 But Kathy Lien, director of research at GFT Forex, said a
rise in the Chinese yuan against the dollar in September
suggests China may have slowed its Treasury buying.
 ""We don't expect Japan, Brazil and Korea's appetite for
dollars to change - in fact it probably strengthened because of
intervention last month,"" she said. ""China on the other hand
allowed its currency to hit a record high which means they may
have cut back their demand for dollars materially.""
 The flood into Treasuries in August caused foreigners to
trim purchases of other U.S. assets. Net equity purchases
retreated to $4.8 billion from $12.5 billion while net
corporate debt purchases slipped to $10 billion from $13.9
billion.
 Overseas investors bought a net $4.6 billion in U.S. agency
debt, compared to $17.3 billion in July.

 By Marat Gurt
 ASHGABAT, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Turkmenistan, Central Asia's
largest natural gas producer, said on Monday it expected an
acceleration in economic growth to 7.5 percent in 2010 from 6.1
percent last year.
 The official forecast, released during an investment forum
in the Turkmen capital, was a rare example of openness from the
reclusive desert nation, where economic indicators have been
hard to come by and often viewed with scepticism by outsiders.
 ""One of our key tasks is ... Turkmenistan's entry into the
world's club of developed nations,"" Deputy Prime Minister
Tuvakmammed Japarov told the forum.
 Turkmenistan holds the world's fourth-largest natural gas
reserves and aims to triple its current annual output of around
75 billion cubic metres (bcm) within 20 years.
 It also hopes to diversify its economy and to increase
levels of foreign investment.
 President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov has ditched some of the
more quirky policies of his authoritarian predecessor,
Saparmurat Niyazov, and embarked on economic reforms.
 Since veteran leader Niyazov died in 2006, Turkmenistan's
economic data has begun to gain more credibility among
independent economists and international lenders, although the
oil and gas industries remain under tight state control.
 According to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency's latest
World Factbook, the country now ranks 102nd in the world in
terms of GDP per capita, sandwiched between Nepal and Honduras.
 
 LOOKING BEYOND RUSSIA
 Keen to lessen its heavy dependence on gas exports to
Russia, Turkmenistan launched a natural gas pipeline to China
last year and has agreed to boost exports to neighbouring Iran.
 Reviving a plan to build a trans-Afghan pipeline to the
markets of Pakistan and India is also on the agenda, as is the
construction of an alternative export route to Europe, known as
Nabucco, which would bypass Russia.
 A project agreed in 2007 to build a natural gas pipeline
along the Caspian Sea to Russia through Kazakhstan has remained
on paper, however. Analysts expect gas will top the agenda when
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev pays a working visit to
Turkmenistan on Oct. 21-22.
 Moscow remains interested in buying large volumes of Turkmen
gas, which costs less to produce than gas from Russia's Arctic.
Russia's gas export monopoly Gazprom resells Turkmen gas to
Ukraine and Europe.
 ""May Gazprom forgive me!"" Yuri Shafranik, head of the Union
of Oil and Gas Producers of Russia, which lobbies the industry's
interests, told Monday's investment forum. ""For us, there is no
escape from our dear Turkmenistan, however we would want it.""
 Japarov said Turkmenistan aims to reduce its dependence on
raw materials production by developing its petrochemicals
industry, and potential export sectors including construction
materials, textiles and electronics.
 Official data show total investment, including foreign
loans, in Turkmenistan's economy is likely to reach up to $57
billion in 2011-15. That includes plans for economic
diversification and studies to confirm the nation's existing
hydrocarbon reserves.
 Foreign investors committed around $10 billion this year to
develop the South Iolotan gas field, one of the world's biggest.

 * Uncertainty whether QE2 has been fully priced in
(Updates prices, adds quote, details, changes dateline,
previous LONDON)
 NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The dollar rose from a
10-month low against a basket of currencies on Monday for the
second straight session as investors continued to bet recent
declines against the greenback are overdone.
 Gains were limited though amid uncertainty on the size of
further quantitative easing though investors were more certain
it will occur after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on
Friday offered his most explicit signal yet that the U.S.
central bank was set to ease monetary policy further.
 The dollar extended a rebound that started late last week,
with the euro retreating from an 8-1/2-month high and the
Australian dollar backing off from Friday's peak above parity,
the currency's highest level since it was floated in 1983.
 Traders said short-term speculation and model accounts and
Asian central banks were active in the session as the euro fell
as low as $1.3830. Next downside targets are technical support
at $1.3825 and then the Oct. 12 low of $1.3775.
 There was muted reaction to foreign investors being heavy
buyers of long-term U.S. securities in August and nearly
tripling monthly purchases of U.S. government debt, according
to a U.S. Treasury Department report on Monday.
 ""It is a continuation from Friday,"" said Chuck Butler,
president of EverBank World Markets in St. Louis. ""Now everyone
knows (QE) is going to happen we are seeing some profit taking
in the euro dollar and commodities.""
 The dollar index was up 0.3 percent at 77.240, after rising
to 77.645. The rally needs to extend above its Oct. 12 high of
77.93 to signal a short-term bottom is in place after Friday's
10-month trough of 76.144, analysts said.
 The index has lost nearly 5 percent in the past month as
investors increased their bets against the dollar on heightened
market expectations for the Federal Reserve to unveil a second
round of quantitative easing as early as November.
 ""The dollar's move down has been extremely aggressive and
there are investors wondering whether or not too much
quantitative easing has been priced in,"" said Jane Foley,
senior currency strategist at Rabobank.
 Market players were also trimming their bets against the
dollar ahead of a forthcoming G20 meeting and before hedge
funds' book closings at the end of November, analysts said.
 The euro was down 0.3 percent on the day at $1.3929, down
from a more than eight-month high of $1.4161, hit on trading
platform EBS on Friday. Traders said an option expiry at
$1.3900 could limit further price movements.
 Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed speculators trimmed bets against the dollar in the
latest week but still had hefty wagers against it.
 QE PRICED IN?
 Two more Fed officials over the weekend joined Bernanke in
arguing for further aggressive action as U.S. inflation
unexpectedly slowed in September even as retail sales picked
up.
 ""More and more Fed officials are signing up for QE and if
anything this short squeeze in the dollar looks to be
temporary,"" said Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of
New York Mellon. ""The Fed is trying to bring about price
stability and generate some inflation in the economy by
flooding the market with more dollars. So the dollar is headed
lower.""
 The dollar's moves have recently been highly correlated
with 10-year U.S. Treasury yields. A senior trader for a major
Japanese bank in Tokyo said the dollar could draw support in
the near term if longer-term Treasury yields continue to rise
after climbing late last week.
 But the dollar ceded ground against the yen, falling 0.3
percent to 81.21 yen and edging back towards a 15-year low of
80.88 hit on EBS last week. Traders reported sovereign demand
around the 81.15 level.
 The Australian dollar fell 0.2 percent to $0.9885,
continuing its pull-back from parity. The Aussie rose to
$1.0004 on Friday, but hit a low of $0.9801 on Monday after
some macro funds sold, with traders citing decent stop-loss
orders at $0.9780.
