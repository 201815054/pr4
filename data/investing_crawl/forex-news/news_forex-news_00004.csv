0,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>",Carry-Trade Warriors of Emerging Markets Enjoy Best Month in Ten,"(Bloomberg) -- Traders who braved the rout in emerging markets in search of higher returns are suddenly reaping the rewards.
A Bloomberg currency index that measures carry-trade returns from eight emerging markets funded by short positions in the dollar has gained 3.2 percent in November so far. If it stays that way, it will be the best month since January.
Carry trades were upended earlier this year as the dollar strengthened and concerns over a protracted trade war rattled markets. But now the slide in the price of oil and growing speculation that the Federal Reserve may slow the pace of interest-rate increases next year have rekindled investor interest in the most beaten-down assets.
“Some of the superb carries are looking increasingly attractive on this subtle shift in Fed narrative alone,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at Oanda Corp. in Singapore. It “brings back some yield appeal to the beleaguered EM carry trade.”
The South African rand, Turkish lira, Indonesian rupiah and Indian rupee -- among this year’s hardest-hit currencies through September -- have led the advance this month. Chile’s peso is also among the biggest gainers, though it isn’t included in Bloomberg’s carry-trade index.
There’s still a potential black spot on the horizon, should President Donald Trump fail to cut a trade deal with China at the Group of 20 summit in Argentina next week.
“Asian currencies could react negatively if U.S. talks with China were to break down,” said Maximillian Lin, an emerging-markets strategist at NatWest in Singapore.

The pound jumped to the highs of the day against the dollar, with GBP/USD hitting highs of 1.2927, before easing back to 1.2903 by 05:40 AM ET (10:40 AM ET).
Bloomberg reported that the draft text says that the EU and the UK will commit to 'deep' customs cooperation and build on 'single customs territory'. The EU is to recognize UK's independent trade policy and the transition period can be extended for up to ""one or two years"".
European Council President Donald Tusk said on Twitter that he sent “a draft Political Declaration on the Future Relationship between EU and UK” to the 27 EU member states. He added that the text had been agreed by negotiators and at the political level, subject to the endorsement of EU leaders.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar edged lower for a second consecutive day on Thursday as greater risk appetite board encouraged investors to sell the greenback after a recent rally.
Indicators of risk in the currency markets such as the euro against the Swiss franc (EURCHF=) and the Canadian dollar  flashed green, though gains were tiny, since U.S. markets were shut for Thanksgiving Day.
""Markets are on a slightly stronger footing today though moves are unlikely to be large given the U.S. markets are closed,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, an FX strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.
Against a basket of other currencies (DXY), the dollar slipped 0.1 percent at 96.65, retreating away from a near 1 1/2- year high of 97.693, hit earlier this month.
The euro (EUR=EBS) rose 0.1 percent as investors grew cautiously optimistic about the near-term outlook, after tensions in the European bond market receded slightly over Italy's budget negotiations with the European Union. 
World markets have settled into a holding pattern with stock markets firmer across the board and eyes shifting to next week’s G20 summit and the weekend EU summit on Brexit.
The latest bout of dollar weakness comes as investors start to question how many times the Federal Reserve can raise interest rates in 2019 without risking a slowdown in the U.S. economy, which has held up so far as borrowing costs have risen.
According to a Reuters poll published on Tuesday, the median analyst forecast is for three more increases next year, taking the federal funds rate to 3.00 to 3.25 percent by end of 2019. But the third rate rise is a close call.
The poll also showed economists now put the probability of a U.S. recession in the next two years at a median 35 percent.
Elsewhere, the British pound  was little changed at $1.2775 as traders await clarity on the progress of a Brexit agreement.
""Until an agreement is reached, sterling will remain under pressure because with each passing day, the risk of a no deal Brexit grows,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director of currency strategy at BK Asset Management in a note.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar traded firm against major peers on Wednesday, extending overnight gains as investors shunned riskier assets in favor of safe haven currencies on escalating worries about slowing global growth and the U.S.-Sino trade war.
With sentiment souring and a global equities rout on Tuesday, risk averse traders sought shelter in the liquid dollar, which climbed from a two-week low hit earlier on Tuesday.
""What's driving currency markets right now are fears of a slowdown in economic growth with safe haven currencies like the dollar and yen likely to benefit,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief markets strategist at CMC Markets.
The greenback had been under pressure for most of this week as cautious comments by Federal Reserve officials and surprisingly weak U.S. economic data suggested the central bank could slow the pace of monetary policy tightening.
The dollar index (DXY), measuring performance against six major peers, was steady at 96.82 on Wednesday. The index gained 0.65 percent in the previous trading session.
""For now, the dollar has retained its safe haven attributes outperforming across the board in the overnight session,"" said Rodrigo Catril, senior currency strategist at NAB, in a note.
With the Federal Reserve widely expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points in December, analysts think the greenback could trade with a positive bias in the short term, despite lowering their longer-term rate hike expectations. 
The yen  traded at 112.91, with the greenback gaining 0.14 percent. The yen hit its highest level this month on Tuesday at 112.29 per dollar before losing steam as dollar bulls took charge.
Despite its safe haven status, the yen's strength has been muted. Analysts suspect this is because Japanese investors have kept their money in U.S. and foreign markets, rather than bring it home.
The euro (EUR=) traded with a weak bias at $1.1372. The single currency lost 0.7 percent of its value on Tuesday.
Wider confidence retreated on Tuesday as Italian bank shares hit a two-year low and the spread between German and Italian bond yields widened. 
Italy is at loggerheads with the European Commission and many fellow euro zone governments over its expansionary 2019 budget, which breaks EU's fiscal rules. 
""The potential for the a further tussle between Rome and Brussels can have an impact on the overall Eurozone economic growth, which will keep the euro under pressure,"" added Michael McCarthy.
The British pound  was little changed at $1.2786, having lost 0.5 percent versus the greenback on Tuesday. The pound is seen likely to trade sideways until the market gets more clarity on progress in the Brexit deal.
The Canadian dollar  dropped to a four-month low versus the dollar to trade at 1.3305 as the price of crude <.CLc1> fell to its lowest level in more than a year ahead of next month's OPEC meeting. Canada is one of the world's top oil exporters.

Elsewhere, the Australian dollar , often considered a barometer of risk appetite, staged a slight recovery along with U.S. equity futures, gaining 0.2 percent to trade at $0.7230. The Aussie dollar lost more than 1 percent on Tuesday as global risk sentiment worsened.

Housing starts rose 1.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.228 million in October, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.
The report also highlighted a sharp 0.6% decline in building permits to a rate of 1.263 million units, beating economists' estimates.
The rebound in housing starts from a decline in the previous month did little to convince analysts that weakness in the housing market was starting to bottom, as they warned that the weaker outlook on building permits would weigh on activity.
The soft trajectory seen for building permits lately suggests that homebuilding likely doesn't have much further room to run, but ""rising wages should continue to support demand in the near term, with higher home prices supporting homebuilding,"" CIBC said in a note.

Carney was addressing U.K. lawmakers, speaking for the first time since Prime Minister Theresa May published her proposed European Union Withdrawal Agreement. He also said the outlook for monetary policy and interest rates will depend on how Brexit affects supply and demand -- and the currency -- in the coming months.
“There will be events that move sterling up and events that move sterling down,” he said. “That will likely continue for the next little while.”
The BOE chief reiterated his view that a disorderly Brexit could produce a supply side shock that is relatively rare for advanced economies, pushing prices higher and forcing the central bank to raise interest rates instead of cut them.
“Implied volatility in sterling is very high right now, much higher than it is for other major currencies, for the obvious reasons of the stakes of the political discussions you are all involved in and the outlook for economy in the short and medium term,” Carney told Parliament’s Treasury Committee.

15,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 19, 2018 11:40PM ET</span>",Tech Rout Threatens Hong Kong Stocks' Biggest Comeback Since '12,"(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong stocks extended declines, threatening to derail what had been a dramatic comeback in its equity market as another slump in global tech darkened sentiment.
The Hang Seng Index fell 1.8 percent by the midday break Tuesday, tracking losses in the Nasdaq 100 Index overnight, with technology and pharma stocks among the biggest losers. A gauge of China stocks fell 1.6 percent, led by CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Ltd.
Hong Kong’s equity benchmark had advanced 5.6 percent in November through Monday, rebounding from its worst streak of monthly losses in 36 years. Its month-to-month turnaround -- the biggest since June 2012 -- has made it the world’s best performing benchmark, despite a relatively lackluster quarterly earnings season.
After tumbling into a bear market in September, Hong Kong’s stocks have struggled to find a floor. Caught in a U.S.-led tech sell-off, a slump in the yuan, a trade dispute between Beijing and Washington, souring sentiment for emerging markets and one of the worst years ever for stocks in mainland China, the city’s traders have barely had a moment of calm. They’ve endured declines exceeding 2 percent for the Hang Seng Index on 14 occasions this year, the most since 2011. Last year, drops of that magnitude happened only twice.
Last week’s better-than-expected results from Tencent Holdings Ltd. had helped improve sentiment, bringing volatility down from the highest level since 2016. The mood was so bearish in October that investors were blindsided by a massive short squeeze at the start of this month, a reminder of how one-directional the market had become.
Tuesday’s losses show how most problems afflicting global investors in 2018 have found a foothold in the Hong Kong. Its largest companies generate the majority of their sales from a slowing China, while the city’s dollar peg ties it to tightening U.S. monetary policy.

16,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2018 05:28PM ET</span>",British government relents to lawmakers' pressure with pledge to publish Brexit forecasts,"LONDON (Reuters) - The British government on Monday pledged to publish economic forecasts that compare Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal with remaining in the European Union, relenting to pressure from lawmakers who sought to force the government to do so.
A junior minister said that the government would publish an economic impact assessment which will compare the impact of May's proposed deal with both the status quo of current EU membership and a ""no-deal"" scenario.
With less than five months before leaving the EU, lawmakers are stepping up a fight over the terms of Britain's departure, with some trying to open the way for the country to change course and offer voters another referendum on its membership.
They say publishing a comparison of the economic impact of May's deal against that of staying in the EU will press the case that Britain should drop its Brexit plans.
More than 70 lawmakers, including several in May's governing Conservative Party, had supported the so-called amendment to the finance bill, to demand the government publish the analysis before a vote on the deal comes before parliament.
Opposition Labour lawmaker Chuka Umunna, who co-authored the amendment, said he was satisfied with the minister's pledge and would not put the amendment forward for a vote.
May's government has promised to publish a range of analyses to help lawmakers decide whether to back her plan for a close trading relationship with the EU after Brexit in a vote in parliament most likely to happen early next month.
But as well as pro-EU lawmakers, she is struggling to convince many pro-Brexit lawmakers in her own party and the Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which props up her government in parliament.
DUP lawmakers earlier failed to back the government on several votes, a sign of the struggle May faces in trying to get her plan through a parliament, which like much of Britain, is still deeply split over Brexit.
Jo Johnson, a Conservative who quit his ministerial role earlier this month in protest at May's Brexit plan and who is now supporting a second referendum, spoke in parliament in favour of the amendment.
""It's extraordinary that we've now had to force the government at this relatively late stage to publish vital information necessary for an informed public debate,"" he said.

18,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 19, 2018 01:21PM ET</span>",Yuan Exposed to Vanishing U.S.-China Yield Gap as Much as Trade,"(Bloomberg) -- The yuan could face more weakness and not only because of rising trade tensions between China and the U.S., or currency manipulation. For the first time in at least a decade, one-year Treasuries yield more than short-term Chinese debt, and BMO Capital Markets says that spells trouble for China’s currency.
A relentless slump in 12-month Treasury bills has pushed the yield to 2.66 percent, edging above the 2.56 percent yield on similar-maturity Chinese securities for the first time since at least 2008. At the start of 2018, the Chinese securities yielded about 200 basis points more than the T-bills.
Diverging monetary policy on the part of the Federal Reserve and the People’s Bank of China should keep that gap growing, leaving the yuan vulnerable, according to BMO. Markets expect U.S. policy makers to raise rates for a fourth time this year in December, while the PBOC eases policy to help a slowing economy.
“For the first time in decades, a 12-month Treasury bill has a higher yield than one-year Chinese debt,” BMO strategists including Jon Hill wrote in a note Monday. “This should put further depreciation pressure on the renminbi which would serve as a disinflationary force domestically, and help to offset the taxes on imports.”
The offshore yuan has weakened about 6 percent against the dollar this year, making it one of the worst-performing Asian currencies and raising speculation that China has been deliberately weakening its currency amid trade tensions with the U.S.
BMO sees those woes deepening after U.S. Vice President Mike Pence sharpened U.S. attacks on China at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, which ended Sunday without a joint statement for the first time since 1993."

At 11:18 AM ET (16:18 GMT), the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, dropped 0.29% to 96.05, after falling 0.48% on Friday.
The dollar’s decline at the end of last week came as Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida indicated there was evidence of a global slowdown and said interest rates were nearing the objective of a neutral rate that neither boosts nor hinders the economy.
Separately, Dallas Fed chief Robert Kaplan said that there is a growth slowdown in Europe and China.
Although a rate hike is expected at the end of the year meeting, the remarks were taken to suggest that the Fed may pause its tightening sooner than expected.
In currency pairs, cable moved higher after last week’s selloff over Brexit turmoil. According to the latest reports, British Prime Minister Theresa May’s opponents are six votes shy of the threshold needed to invoke a no confidence vote. Although the lack of support may lower the uncertainty over May’s place at the helm, doubt remains that she will be able to pass the Brexit deal through British parliament.
GBP/USD was last up 0.18% at 1.2857.
The euro benefitted from dollar weakness, changing hands at 1.1451, its highest level since Nov. 7.
Meanwhile, concerns over the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China sparked demand for the safe haven yen.
U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters on Friday that his administration may not impose tariffs on more Chinese goods after China sent a list of measures that it would be prepared to take in order to help resolve a trade dispute between the two nations.
However, hopes that Trump’s remarks might signal a change in the direction of negotiations were dashed by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Saturday. Pence insisted that the U.S. will not back down from its trade dispute with China, and might even double its tariffs, unless Beijing bows to U.S. demands.
Pence’s comments dashed hopes of meaningful progress between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 meeting to be held at the end of the month.
U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods are set to increase to 25% from 10% on Jan. 1.

22,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 19, 2018 04:41AM ET</span>",Citigroup Sees U.S. Dollar Topping Out in 2019,"(Bloomberg) -- The dollar will weaken next year as the economic boost from fiscal policy wanes and rising interest rates start to hurt, according to Citigroup Inc.
The greenback will fall around 2 percent against the Group-of-10 peers over six to 12 months after climbing 1 percent in the next three months, analysts including London-based Jeremy Hale wrote in a note. Absolute growth and relative cyclical outperformance in the U.S. will slow and the yield advantage enjoyed by the dollar will be less sustainable, they said.
“More medium term, our view is that the fiscal support to growth eventually fades in the U.S. and tighter monetary policy starts to bite,” the analysts wrote. “A lower dollar becomes the most likely source of equilibrium in portfolio balance terms.”
The U.S. currency has rallied against all G-10 peers this year, buoyed by three Federal Reserve rate hikes while robust corporate earnings sent major benchmark stock indexes to record highs.
Citigroup’s call for the dollar to top out next year echos those by other Wall Street investment banks including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
“We see several changes to the global economic backdrop which, combined with a few negative medium-run factors, point to more downside than upside to the broad dollar in 2019,” Goldman Sachs analysts including Zach Pandl wrote in a note dated Nov. 18. “Slower U.S. growth tends to result in lower dollar returns (especially against G-10, but to some extent versus EM as well) even when U.S. interest rates are rising faster than expected.”
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has gained more than 7 percent from a low in April, while hedge funds have raised their net long positions this month to the highest since January 2017.
The bull run in the dollar has ended and it’s time to sell the currency, Morgan Stanley’s global head of foreign-exchange strategy Hans Redeker wrote in a note last week. “The USD may weaken as credit spreads widen, equity prices fall, and sovereign bond yields begin falling amid disinflationary pressure and falling oil prices.”

25,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2018 11:24PM ET</span>","Dollar pauses as Fed officials caution about global growth, yen firms","By Vatsal Srivastava
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar eased slightly versus other major currencies on Monday after Federal Reserve officials expressed caution over the global growth outlook, prompting traders to reassess the pace of future U.S. interest rate increases. 
The greenback has enjoyed a strong run this year thanks to the Fed's steady policy tightening on the back of a robust economy and rising wage pressures. A fourth rate hike for this year is expected next month and policy makers had indicated two more by June 2019.
But comments on Friday by Richard Clarida, the Fed's newly appointed vice chair, put to the test market expectations for a steady pace of tightening. Clarida cautioned about a slowdown in global growth, saying ""that's something that is going to be relevant"" for the outlook for the U.S. economy.
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan, in a separate interview with Fox Business, also said he is seeing a growth slowdown in Europe and China.
The comments may hint that the Fed is set to slow down its pace of monetary tightening and led some traders to question whether the dollar's rally was nearing its end, with the benchmark U.S. 10 year treasury yields (US10YT=RR) pulling back slightly.
New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) will speak later on Monday and traders would be waiting to see if he echoes the same theme as his colleagues. 
""The market has definitely interpreted these statements as dovish. However, the Fed has always remained data dependent and to that extent, this should not come as a surprise,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief markets strategist at CMC Markets.
The dollar index (DXY), a gauge of its value versus six major peers, traded marginally weaker at 96.45, adding to a decline of 0.5 percent on Friday. The dollar index had hit a 16-month high of 97.69 on Nov. 12.
The yen  was fetching 112.68 on the dollar, up slightly on the day. The dollar lost 0.9 percent versus the yen last week as traders rushed into the safe-haven Japanese currency on concerns over U.S.-Sino trade tensions and political risks in Europe around Brexit and the Italian budget.
The euro (EUR=) dipped 0.1 percent in Asian trade, changing hands at $1.1403, having advanced over the last four trading sessions despite weaker economic fundamentals.
The single currency has gained 2.7 percent versus the pound (EURGBP=) since Nov. 13 as uncertainty over a smooth Brexit deal remains at the forefront. 
""Euro has traded almost exclusively on anti-dollar flows and risk appetite and we expect the same this week as the currency looks past any weakness in Germany's PPI report or eurozone PMIs,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director of currency strategy at BK Asset Management.
The British pound  wobbled at $1.2832, having come under heavy selling last week amid turmoil over British Prime Minister Theresa May's draft Brexit plan.
The currency is expected to remain under pressure until the market gets more clarity on the progress of the Brexit deal, CMC Markets' McCarthy said.
In the days since May unveiled a draft EU divorce deal, May's premiership has been thrust into crisis. Several ministers, including her Brexit minister, have resigned and some of her lawmakers are seeking to oust her.
With both pro-EU and pro-Brexit lawmakers unhappy with the draft agreement, it is not clear she will be able to win the backing of parliament for it, raising the risk Britain leaves the EU without a deal.
The Australian dollar  traded down 0.2 percent at $0.7317 as U.S.-Sino trade tensions showed no signs of abating.
China is Australia's largest trade partner and any negative sentiment affecting the world's second biggest economy tends to undermine the Aussie.

Clarida told CNBC on Friday the Fed is getting closer to a neutral rate -- one that neither overstimulates the economy, nor stifles growth -- and cited ""some evidence"" that global economy is slowing.
Clarida's remarks was viewed as dovish, sending the dollar tumbling, leading some to speculate whether the Fed would pause its gradual rate hikes sooner than expected, despite analysts downplaying the remarks.
RBC said that the market reactions to interpretations of the Fed ""seem completely backwards,"" as there was ""nothing in the economic data has shifted the Fed’s growth and inflation outlook.""
Economic data offered little in the way of support for the greenback, as industrial production fell short of economists' estimates.

31,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 03:55AM ET</span>",Pound Plunge Was Mere Prelude to What May Happen With No Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- U.K. politicians got a first view Thursday of the financial market turmoil that may be triggered if they fail to approve the Brexit deal struck with the European Union.
It didn’t look pretty. A drop of almost 2 percent in currency markets; banks, builders and utilities tumbling 5 percent or more; rising credit risks and a debt sale that was pulled -- these are the sort of moves that draw comparisons with emerging-market economies. And volatility markets point to the possibility of things getting much worse before they get better.
That rebuke may chasten lawmakers and ultimately force them into action, analysts say.
“The assumption that a Brexit deal will be reached and ratified by all sides has now been called into question,” writes Lena Komileva, an economist in London at G Plus Economics. “For a deal to happen, the threat of a no deal has to become realistic, causing serious financial disruption, and a possible business and consumer confidence shock.”
True, markets may take temporary solace in the leadership of Theresa May: sterling steadied during her defiant press conference on Thursday. If she can hold onto the leadership of the Conservative Party, that may lift its fortunes, at least for a while.
But if lawmakers reject the deal, the currency vigilantes may re-emerge en masse over the low-liquidity Christmas period, ratcheting up pressure on a divided Parliament. Remember the 6 percent flash crash in October 2016 when the pound was pummeled in just one minute in thin Asian trading?
“It will take a brave Parliament to reject the economic security of an unpopular compromise arrangement for the uncertain alternatives that risk a damaging no-deal Brexit,” David Page, a senior economist at Axa Investment Managers, wrote in a note. “Even now speculation mounts that if Parliament rejects a deal in December, a second vote could follow in February once alternative options have been explored and exhausted over the intervening months, that might yet accept such a deal.”

32,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>","Morgan Stanley Says Dollar Bull Run Has Ended, Time to Sell","(Bloomberg) -- The dollar’s bull run has ended and it’s time to sell the currency, according to Morgan Stanley.
“We believe the USD has reached its peak at around current levels,” Morgan Stanley’s global head of FX strategy Hans Redeker wrote in a note. “The USD may weaken as credit spreads widen, equity prices fall, and sovereign bond yields also begin falling amid disinflationary pressure and falling oil prices.”
Escalating trade tensions, climbing Treasury yields and a robust U.S. economy have fuelled investor demand for the world’s biggest reserve currency. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has gained 8 percent since mid-April, cheered on by bullish hedge funds who recently raised their net long positions on the currency to the highest since January 2017.
However, Morgan Stanley reckons recent foreign flows into U.S. assets have been short-term and are prone to a quick reversal -- another sign dollar weakness may come.
“Instead of strong inward foreign direct investment or other long-term flows, we see evidence that flows to the U.S. have been into money market funds and are carry trade motivated,” Redeker said.
Morgan Stanley has joined a growing pool of banks that think the greenback’s strength is waning. Goldman Sachs’ foreign-exchange strategy team said the greenback is approaching a peak, which should relieve pressure on currencies such as the yuan. Credit Agricole also sees a weaker dollar after the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives at the U.S. midterm.
Cheaper Oil
Adding fuel to the bearish fire will be a slowing American economy, falling oil prices, a stabilizing Chinese currency and tighter liquidity in U.S. markets, Redeker said.
This means emerging-market assets that have been battered by rising Treasury yields and dollar strength now look set to shine, according to Redeker. Lower oil prices and stable building material prices including those of iron ore and copper may augur an emerging market rally, he said.
“We expect slowing U.S. growth to benefit countries that are either reliant on USD-denominated funding or vulnerable to higher global funding costs,” Redeker said."

At least 16 members of her own Conservative Party have called for a vote of no confidence in May, citing dissatisfaction with her proposals, the CNBC reported.
Without a deal, the U.K. would move from seamless trade with the EU to customs arrangements set by the World Trade Organization for external states.
Sterling would sink as a result while bond yields on U.K. debt would also likely fall.
Meanwhile, the safe-haven yen has benefited from a deepening Brexit crisis and traded higher on Thursday. The USD/JPY pair dropped 0.3% to 113.4.
Elsewhere, the U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was down 0.1% to 96.79.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The British pound struggled to stay afloat in Asian trade on Friday having suffered a tumultuous slide overnight, as investors feared political turmoil in the country could see it crash out of the European Union without a divorce deal. 
Both the dollar and the yen benefited from a deepening crisis for UK Prime Minister Theresa May after the resignation of key ministers from her government imperiled her Brexit plan. 
That left the sterling  vulnerable to further losses. It was changing hands at $1.2792, barely holding steady after declining 1.7 percent on Thursday, its steepest percentage slide since Oct. 11 2016.
""Political troubles are never good for the currency but in the case of the UK, the pound could drop to 1.25 versus the dollar on the prospect of a no deal Brexit, leadership challenge and slower growth,"" Kathy Lien, managing director of currency strategy at BK Asset Management said in a note.
The resignations, including that of Brexit minister Dominic Raab, came hours after May had claimed backing for a draft divorce deal. The hostility from government and opposition lawmakers raised the risk that the deal would be rejected in parliament, and that Britain could leave the EU on March 29 without a safety net..
May's compromise plan, which seeks to maintain close trade ties with the EU in the future, is facing opposition from Brexiteers, pro-Europeans, the Northern Irish party that props up her government, and even some of her own ministers, thus raising the risks of her losing her job, of Britain leaving the bloc with no agreement or even another referendum.
Without a deal, the UK would move in March from seamless trade with the EU to customs arrangements set by the World Trade Organization for external states, which could cause panic in financial markets. 
However, some analysts believe sterling bulls have a reason not to throw in their towel yet, noting there is a chance of another referendum with the choice between a hard Brexit and remaining in the EU.
A snap Sky News poll yesterday showed 55 percent in favor of another referendum, while 54 percent supported no Brexit, 32 percent a hard Brexit and only 14 percent May's deal.
“A second referendum would likely result in clear vote to remain, a strongly positive outcome for GBP. With that in mind we think the upside tail has fattened more than the downside,” said Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC in a note.
The euro (EUR=) tacked on 0.05 percent to trade at $1.1338. Investors were hopeful after reports out of Italy said that Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte was looking to work with the EU over his government's 2019 budget, which has been rejected by Brussels. 
The single currency has gained over the last three trading sessions, but was up only 0.1 percent versus the dollar month to date, underscoring the strains from weakening economic momentum in Europe, Italian budget woes and the Brexit uncertainty.
The dollar index (DXY), a gauge of its value versus six major peers, was up 0.05 percent at 96.97, not far off a 16-month high of 97.69 hit at the start of the week.
Currency markets were also keeping an eye on the U.S.-Sino trade tensions as traders looked for concrete signs the economic powers were seeking to de-escalate their dispute. 
A Financial Times report said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has told some industry executives that another round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports has been put on hold. But a U.S. Trade Representative spokesperson later denied this report.
""This is a clear sign of the tussle taking place between the doves and hawks in the trade camp..we will be hearing more of this till the upcoming G-20 meet,"" said Sim Moh Siong, currency strategist at Bank of Singapore.
Most analysts forecast the dollar to remain well supported in coming months thanks to the Federal Reserve's commitment to continue to gradually raise interest rates. A fourth hike for this year is expected next month, backed by a robust economy and rising wage pressures.
The safe-haven yen  was well bid in Asian trade, changing hands at 113.34, as the Brexit turmoil drew investors toward the Japanese currency. The yen had hit a six-week low of 114.20 on Monday before reversing course.

The Australian dollar  lost 0.14 percent at $0.7272 on Friday. The Aussie had gained 0.58 percent in the previous trading session on the back of stronger than expected jobs data.

It is ""no surprise"" that EU efforts to establish a so-called Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for non-dollar trade with Iran were floundering over fear in EU capitals that hosting it would incur U.S. punishment, Special Representative Brian Hook said. 
""European banks and European companies know that we will vigorously enforce sanctions against this brutal and violent regime,"" he said in a telephone briefing with reporters.
""Any major European company will always choose the American market over the Iranian market.""
The SPV is seen as the lynchpin of European efforts to salvage the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran from which U.S. President Donald Trump, who took office after the deal was sealed, withdrew in May.
Iran has warned it could scrap the agreement, which curbed its disputed program in exchange for sanctions relief, if the EU fails to preserve the deal's economic benefits.
The SPV was conceived as a clearing house that could be used to help match Iranian oil and gas exports against purchases of EU goods in an effective barter arrangement circumventing U.S. sanctions, based on global use of the dollar for oil sales. 
Brussels had wanted to have the SPV set up by this month, but no country has offered to host it, six diplomats told Reuters this week.
Their reluctance arises from fears that SPV reliance on local banks to smooth trade with Iran may trigger U.S. penalties, severing the lenders' access to U.S. financial markets, diplomats said.
Criticizing EU efforts to bypass sanctions, Hook reiterated a warning that such an EU effort sent ""the wrong signal, at the wrong time.""
However, he added that waivers from sanctions granted to eight of Iran's biggest oil importers were to ensure the U.S. measures did not harm allies or raise oil prices.

""We have looked at these on a case by case basis, taking into account the unique needs of friends and partners, and also ensuring that as we impose sanctions on Iran's oil sector that we do not lift the price of oil,"" Hook said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar jumped and traders bought into the safe-haven yen on Thursday after Britain's Brexit deal with the European Union was plunged into uncertainty, spooking investors across currency markets.
The resignation of a series of British ministers in opposition to the newly-agreed Brexit withdrawal deal sent sterling plummeting more than one percent  (EURGBP=D3). 
It also dragged the euro into negative territory as investors took fright at turmoil in one of the euro zone's biggest trading partners.
The dollar index, which measures the buck against major currencies, firmed half a percent to 97.268 (DXY). The yen gained 0.2 percent to 113.42 against the dollar and was up 0.3 percent versus the euro (EURJPY=). 
Both currencies are sought out as safe places to park your cash in times of market flux.
""The dollar is benefiting from the sterling crash,"" said Manuel Oliveri, FX strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR).
Bond investors scrambled for safety, piling into German government debt.
British Prime Minister Theresa May had said she won the backing of her senior ministers for an EU divorce deal on Wednesday but many in her government are unconvinced.
Raab's resignation leaves May battling for survival as well as trying to win over her Conservative Party to support the EU withdrawal agreement. 
The euro, after earlier trading 0.3 percent higher, fell 0.2 percent to $1.1291 (EUR=). 
Sterling shed as much as 1.7 percent versus the dollar to below $1.27  and 1.5 percent versus the euro to 88.44 pence (EURGBP=). 
The pound recovered slightly as May sought to sell the benefits of the deal in a speech to the British parliament.
""May has survived resignations before but coming on the back of her final deal, this could be far more damaging if others walk as well,"" said Craig Erlam, an analyst at OANDA.
""More worrying could be reports that enough letters may have been collected to trigger a leadership challenge. There's no guarantee this would be successful but you have to think that there is at least a belief that there’s enough support."" 
Analysts said the dollar's gains on the back of the sterling slump were contained after some cautious comments about the economic outlook from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell overnight.
Reports out of Italy that Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte was looking to work with the EU over his government's 2019 budget, which has been rejected by Brussels, to avert massive fines had earlier helped support Italian government bond markets and the euro.
The Australian dollar jumped more than 0.8 percent to $0.7294  after upbeat jobs data. The New Zealand dollar also rose . 

Both later gave up some of those gains as investors turned more cautious about taking on risk in currency markets following sterling's slide lower.

LONDON (Reuters) - The pound plunged against both the euro and the dollar on Thursday after British Brexit minister Dominic Raab resigned in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May's draft deal for leaving the European Union.
Raab said May's plan threatened the integrity of the United Kingdom and he could not support an indefinite backstop arrangement where the EU held a veto over Britain's ability to exit the bloc.
His resignation fueled a selloff in the British currency which was already struggling to gain traction after May said on Wednesday she had won over her divided cabinet following a five-hour meeting.
In volatile trading, the British currency plunged one percent against the dollar  to $1.2839 and 1.3 percent against the euro (EURGBP=D3) to 88.23 pence.
""Raab resigning just now changes the ballgame. Hard to be optimistic on GBP in the short term. "" Nomura analyst Jordan Rochester said. ""But equally Theresa May has survived much worse. It’s whether we get a flood of (ministerial) resignations to follow.""
Those concerns were reflected in the foreign exchange derivatives markets where three and six-month gauges of expected volatility in the British currency remained firm while extreme short-dated volatility indicators edged lower.
That uncertainty was also reflected in the money markets where investors have all but priced out a rate hike by the Bank of England next year.
Bond yields fell across the board with those on benchmark two-year British government debt falling 9 basis points to 0.7 percent. 

Big moves this week have boosted volatility in the British currency with realized price swings this week alone averaging about 12 percent annualized on a daily basis, twice that of end-October.

Sterling struggled to rally even after Prime Minister Theresa May said an impassioned debate led to backing from her top ministers at a lengthy meeting on Wednesday. Brexit negotiators secured a deal on paper in Brussels Tuesday, yet the currency has fluctuated on worries that lawmakers could reject the agreement.
The currency has slumped about 13 percent against the dollar since the U.K. voted to leave the EU in 2016 and has since fluctuated on the twists and turns of the negotiations. Failure to get a deal or Parliament backing this year could see a slump toward $1.20, while approval by lawmakers could drive a rally toward $1.40, according to strategists.
“It took her more than five hours to get agreement from her Cabinet, but there are increasing murmurings of a leadership challenge,” said Jeremy Stretch, head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, adding investors appeared to “buy the rumor, sell the fact” after the announcement. Stretch said getting Parliament’s approval would be difficult and he would prefer to sell any rally toward $1.3075.
The pound gained 0.4 percent to $1.3029, after earlier falling to a low of $1.2882.
With just over four months to go before the Brexit deadline, the agreement marks a significant step toward a two-year transition period and trade talks, relieving some of the uncertainty for companies including the banks and investment firms that crowd London’s historic financial center.
Strategists see a sustained rally being conditional on the Brexit text being approved in Parliament. A majority of lawmakers must vote in favor for the deal to pass, and May faces opposition from both within her own Conservative party and the opposition Labour. Anger among Conservatives is “so high” that a call for a confidence vote in May is possible, BBC editor Laura Kuenssberg said on Twitter, citing an unidentified member of the party.
If the deal is voted down when it goes to Parliament, it could lead to the U.K. having to return to the negotiating table, holding a general election or even a second referendum. The vote could be a “real knife-edge affair,” said Stretch.

If the cabinet approves the plan, the EU expects to hold a special Brexit summit on Nov. 25. May can then present the deal to parliament, most likely in mid-December.
The euro was little changed against the pound, with EUR/GBP at 0.8702, holding above the five month lows of 0.8655 reached on Tuesday.

The data came after a report overnight showing that Japan’s economy contracted in the three months to September.
Investors were looking ahead to preliminary data on third quarter growth in the wider euro zone later in the day.
The euro was also on the back foot after Italy defied the European Commission by sticking to plans for a high deficit in next years draft budget.
Brussels, worried by the impact of high spending on Italy's high levels of debt, had told Rome to revise the budget or face possible fines.

The dollar was unchanged as traders awaited Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell’s speech later in the day.
The USD/CNY pair was down 0.08% to 6.9514 by 1:00 AM ET (06:00 GMT).
China’s October industrial output and third-quarter investment grew faster than expected, but retail sales missed expectations, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reported on Wednesday.
Industrial output jumped 5.9% in October, outperforming previous expectations of a 5.7% growth, the NBS said.
Meanwhile, Fixed-asset investment growth came in at 5.7% in the January-October period, again beating analysts’ estimates of a 5.5% growth.
Private-sector fixed-asset investment rose 8.8% in January-October, compared with an increase of 8.7% in the first three quarters.
Private investment accounts for about 60% of overall investment in China.
Retail sales, on the other hand, rose 8.6% year-on-year in October. Markets expected sales to rise by 9.1%.

Crude Oil WTI Futures declined 0.3% at $55.5 a barrel by 11:19 AM ET (04:19 GMT).
Brent Oil Futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., were down 0.2%, to $65.34.
Both benchmarks are now officially in bear market territory, after slumping more than 20% from their 52-week highs.
""It's like a run on the bank,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. ""It's getting to the point where it doesn't seem to be about fundamentals anymore, but a total collapse in price.""
Citing analysts, Reuters said worries over weakening global demand, and surging U.S. production were the main catalysts for the selling.
Overall U.S. crude production hit a record 11.6 million bpd, making the United States the world's biggest oil producer ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia.
Meanwhile, the American Petroleum Institute showed on Tuesday that U.S. crude inventories climbed by 7.8 million barrels in the week ending Nov. 2 to 432 million as refineries cut output.
Crude oil prices surged earlier this year as the market prepared for shortages amid restoration of sanctions against Iran, the third-largest producer of OPEC.
The positive sentiment in oil prices diminished however after the sanctions were proven to be less severe, as U.S. President Donald Trump announced last week that several of Iran’s major buyers would be granted exemptions that allow them to continue buying limited amounts of crude for at least another six months.
Trump’s comments came one day after Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih said Saudi Arabia would cut oil output from December and suggested that other members of OPEC and their non-OPEC allies led by Russia could follow suit.
The kingdom would cut oil supply by 0.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in December due to lower seasonal demand. The cut represents a reduction in global oil supply of about 0.5%, according to reports.

49,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>","Pound Surges, Gilts Slide on Signals of Brexit Breakthrough","(Bloomberg) -- The pound surged on signs that the U.K. is inching closer to an agreement with the European Union on a Brexit divorce deal.
The currency climbed to the strongest level since April versus the euro after a report that negotiators have agreed on an Irish border backstop, a key sticking point in the talks. Prime Minister Theresa May will hold a Cabinet meeting Wednesday to discuss a draft Brexit agreement, and a summit with the EU could occur as soon as Nov. 25. Gilts declined as conviction grew that the Bank of England will raise interest rates next year.
The currency bounced in response to a “breakthrough in the Brexit negotiations,” said Valentin Marinov, head of FX research at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA. “What remains to be seen is whether the U.K. Cabinet will agree to the proposed text.”
The pound rose as much as 1.5 percent to $1.3047 before paring gains, and reached 86.56 pence per euro, the strongest level since April 18. The yield on the U.K. 10-year government bond increased nearly seven basis points to 1.52 percent. In money markets, short-sterling implied yields climbed, a sign traders may be raising bets on rate increases by the central bank, should a Brexit deal be concluded.
Even if the Cabinet signs off, the agreement would need approval from parliament, where May faces a stiff challenge. And while the body may approve a withdrawal by March, the pound could suffer some whiplash on the way,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) currency strategist Erik Nelson and economic analyst Abigail Kinnaman said in a note to clients. If that scenario plays out, the pound-dollar rate could near $1.34 in six months and $1.40 in a year, they said.
“We see potential for a rally (around 1%) in the pound once a withdrawal deal is finalized by the EU and U.K. and then another, larger, rally (perhaps 2-3%) once that deal is ratified by parliament,” they wrote, referring to that base-case scenario. “The period between the initial deal being reached and the subsequent ratification by parliament will likely be marked by ongoing volatility and uncertainty, which could see the pound retrench.”
In the case of a “no-deal” Brexit outcome, Nelson and Kinnaman see the pound falling nearly 8 percent against the dollar and 6 percent against the euro.
May doesn’t have a majority in parliament and faces opposition from Labour Party lawmakers. She also has to appease some of the hard line Brexiteers within her Conservative party.
Some were quick to criticize the deal. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson said the deal, as reported, would be voted down, and pro-Brexit Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said the Cabinet shouldn’t support the pact. Boris Johnson also said he’d vote against the deal, though acknowledged that neither side wants a no-deal outcome.
Earlier Tuesday, Irish broadcaster RTE cited an unidentified senior official as saying that the key part of the Withdrawal Agreement had been agreed. Still, the official said it would be wrong to say that negotiations were concluded. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar declined to comment on the report. The Telegraph newspaper also reported that the two sides had agreed on the text of a divorce deal.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro and sterling rose on Tuesday following comments from a British official that signaled Britain and the European Union are close to clinching an agreement for the nation to leave the economic bloc as negotiators seek to avoid missing a deadline.
A stronger euro and sterling spurred profit-taking in the dollar, which reached a 16-month peak against a basket of currencies on Monday. 
Uncertainty over the terms of Brexit has bogged down both currencies as a deal is required to keep business open between the EU and the world's fifth-biggest economy.
The euro's gain was limited by concerns about Italy's budget proposals and downbeat German investor sentiment data, traders said.
""News that the EU and U.K. nearly have a Brexit deal in place is injecting short-term flows into the common currency,"" said Viash Sreemuntoo, corporate trader at XE in Toronto. 
Encouraging comments on Brexit negotiations lifted the pound to a 6-1/2 month peak versus the euro. Sterling reversed much of Monday's loss against the dollar.
""We are almost within touching distance now,"" British Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington, who is Prime Minister Theresa May's de facto deputy, told BBC radio.
At 10:49 a.m. (1549 GMT), the euro was up 0.52 percent at $1.12770. It had fallen to $1.1216, the lowest since June 2017. 
The common currency was down 0.29 percent at 87.05 pence after touching 86.82 pence earlier Tuesday, which was the lowest since April 26.
Sterling was up 0.89 percent at $1.2964 following a nearly 1 percent drop on Monday.
An index that tracks the dollar versus the euro, sterling, yen and three other currencies (DXY) was 0.28 percent lower at 97.269, easing below a 16-month high of 97.693 reached on Monday.
In contrast to the latest news on Brexit, Italy's budget proposals remain a drag on the euro.
Tuesday is the deadline for Italy, the euro zone's third- biggest economy, to resubmit its budget plans to the EU after a showdown between Rome and Brussels over the government's 2019 spending plans.
The European Commission rejected Italy's draft fiscal plan last month and has threatened to impose penalties if it is not revised to conform with EU regulations - something Rome has indicated it is unwilling to do. 
The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday warned the government's stimulus plan would leave Italy vulnerable.
The tension between Rome and Brussels has raised fears about Italy's membership in the euro zone.
""Italy is the big test case for the euro,"" said Joachim Fels, global economic advisor at PIMCO at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in New York. ""That risk is not going away anytime soon.""

The gap on 2-year Treasury yields over their German counterparts this month surged to about 3.5 percentage points, a record. For Bilal Hafeez, Nomura’s global head of Group-of-10 foreign-exchange strategy, the size of the spread may be enough to spur a carry trade into the dollar.
Europe’s common currency was trading at $1.1242 as of 11:25 a.m. New York time, close to the weakest since June 2017. Hafeez did point to some silver linings for the euro. For one, he sees signals from the financial markets that the risks from Italy’s budget crisis may not spread to the rest of Europe. What’s more, the boost from U.S. fiscal stimulus appears set to wear off next year.
“The yield angle is therefore the most compelling to see further euro weakness,” Hafeez wrote in a note Monday. He added that the euro could settle into a range of $1.10-$1.135, which it stuck to for much of 2015 and 2016.
The outlook for the dollar carry trade, and thus for the euro-dollar rate, is clouded by the potential for a bout of risk aversion that causes the strategy to fall apart, Hafeez wrote. The dollar carry trade against the euro has returned 3.5 percent this quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar built on last week's gains and rose toward a 16-month high on Monday as traders expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to keep tightening monetary policy, but sterling remained under heavy pressure amid uncertainty over a Brexit deal.
The Fed has reaffirmed its plan to raise interest rates by 25 basis points in December, followed by two more potential rate hikes by mid-2019 on the back of an upbeat economy and rising wage pressures.
The greenback has also benefited from a broader move away from riskier assets due to U.S.-Sino trade tensions, China's economic slowdown, Brexit uncertainty, and the standoff between Rome and the European Union over Italy's plan for a big-spending budget and wide fiscal deficit. 
The dollar index (DXY) against other major currencies edged up 0.1 percent on Monday to 97.02, just below its 16-month high of 97.2 hit on Oct. 31. The dollar index has strengthened four weeks in row, gaining 0.4 percent last week.
""The dollar index was firm all last week, bouncing back after the (U.S.) mid-term election results. Looking ahead, moves will be driven by the developments around the Italian budget and Brexit politics,"" said Sim Moh Siong, currency strategist at Bank of Singapore.
The dollar gained 0.1 percent on the Japanese yen  which quoted at 113.98 on Monday, near a 6-week low of 114.08. The dollar has been preferred over the yen because of the diverging monetary policies of the Fed and the Bank of Japan.
While the Fed is on track to raise interest rates, the BOJ is expected to keep its monetary policy ultra-loose in the face of slow growth and inflation.
The widening interest rate differential between U.S. and Japanese bonds has made the dollar a more attractive bet than the yen, which is often used as a funding currency for carry trades.
The British pound  lost 0.25 percent to $1.2941 amid increasingly fraught tensions within British Prime Minister Theresa May's government over whether she can produce an orderly exit plan from the European Union.
With less than five months before Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29, negotiations are still stuck over a backup plan for the land border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland, should they fail to clinch a long-term deal.
Four British ministers who back remaining in the European Union are on the verge of quitting Theresa May's government over Brexit, the Sunday Times reported, adding to the political uncertainty.
""Eventually, the EU and May will come to a deal. Both parties want to conclude the deal, but the only risk is whether May will still be prime minister. I expect sterling to remain choppy in its recent wide range,"" added Sim Moh Siong.
The euro (EUR=) traded at $1.1329 on Monday, down 0.05 percent. The single currency lost ground versus the dollar in the previous three trading sessions as investor confidence weakened due to the standoff over Italy's budget.
The European Commission rejected Italy's 2019 budget last month, saying it flouted a previous commitment to lower the country's deficit. The EU gave Rome until Tuesday to present a revised version of the budget.
The EU also cut its forecasts for Italian growth last week, adding to investor concerns over Italy's debts and economic outlook.

The Australian dollar  gained 0.1 percent versus the greenback to $0.7232. The Aussie has rallied more than 3 percent in the last two weeks on the back of stronger than expected trade data and a less dovish Reserve Bank of Australia.

The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was up 0.1% to 96.87 by 10:36 PM ET (3:36 GMT). The index has strengthened four weeks in a row, gaining 0.4% last week.
The Fed indicated last week that it is still on course to hike interest rates in December and in early 2019, with the U.S. economy looking strong on almost all fronts.
""The dollar index was firm all last week, bouncing back after the mid-term election results. Looking ahead, moves will be driven by the developments around the Italian budget and Brexit politics,"" said Sim Moh Siong, currency strategist at Bank of Singapore.
The EUR/USD pair and the GBP/USD pair slipped 0.1% and 0.3% respectively.
Brexit negotiations remained in focus amid reports that the UK and European Union are edging closer to a draft deal.
""Eventually, the EU and May will come to a deal. Both parties want to conclude the deal, but the only risk is whether May will still be Prime Minister. I expect sterling to remain choppy in its recent wide range,"" added Sim Moh Siong.
USD/CNY inched up 0.1% to 6.9632 as the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the yuan reference rate at 6.9476 vs Friday's fix of 6.9560.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY was up 0.2% to 114.0, while AUD/USD and NZD/USD were little changed at 0.7228 and 0.6745 respectively.

62,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 11, 2018 09:10PM ET</span>",Traders Eye Yuan Proxies as China Intervention Risks Linger,"(Bloomberg) -- China bears are shorting yuan proxies, as risks of central bank intervention loom large with the currency edging closer to its decade-low again.
Yuan proxies -- such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars -- are appealing, as they are more flexible, liquid and less affected if the Chinese central bank intervenes, according to Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. Other popular proxies include the Korean won, and the Taiwanese, Singaporean and Hong Kong dollars, analysts say. Such exchange rates tend to decline on negative sentiment toward China because the nation is their major export market.
The yuan posted the worst weekly loss since July in the five days through Nov. 9, after a short-lived rebound built on bets the world’s two largest economies may reach a deal on trade. The slide in the currency, also fueled by looser monetary policy and slower growth, stoked concerns that the People’s Bank of China may punish bears by removing liquidity or selling the dollar aggressively -- tactics it used repeatedly in 2016-17.
""I can’t help but be bearish on the Aussie, which is the most liquid proxy to express China risks,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp. in Singapore. If needed, ""the PBOC can be merciless and jack up interest rates to outrageous levels. While the proxies will follow the yuan stronger in that case, they will not do so with the same vigor and allow a more comfortable exit if you decide to cut and run.""
The yuan has tumbled more than 6 percent this year, prompting investment banks from  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). to JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). to predict a breach of 7 per dollar for the first time since the global financial crisis. The Aussie has plunged more than 7 percent, while the won has slid 5 percent during the same period.
There are signs that policy makers are growing less comfortable with the depreciation. The PBOC sold bills in Hong Kong for the first time on Nov. 7, a move that  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc said may signal tougher currency management ahead. Late last month, the central bank’s deputy governor Pan Gongsheng said China is confident that the yuan will be kept stable.
While heavy, direct intervention hasn’t been seen of late, it can happen anytime at the whim of the PBOC. In January 2017, when officials grew upset about the yuan’s weakness, they choked cash supply in Hong Kong and sent the currency’s deposit rates to record highs. A stampede of bears followed suit, fueling a 2.4 percent spike in the offshore yuan within two days. But during the same period, the Aussie and kiwi both strengthened about 1.6 percent.
Proxies are ""a lot more logical vehicle for China bears because of limited flexibility of the yuan,"" said Callow, who sees a strong chance of intervention before the Chinese currency hits 7 per dollar. ""Plus, they are tradeable 24 hours a day and five days a week, liquid and do not have a central bank threatening to step in.""
Also, interest rates on proxies are usually cheaper than those on the yuan, making it less expensive for bears to place short bets. While the offshore yuan’s one-month forward implied yield -- a gauge of traders’ expectations on the currency’s funding costs -- stood at 4 percent on Monday, the equivalent for the won was around 1.8 percent and 2.2 percent for the Aussie.
Crowded Trade
However, some traders -- especially those who are foreseeing a major devaluation in the yuan -- may prefer to short the currency directly. That’s because the proxies aren’t as overvalued and have become a crowded trade, said Kevin Smith, founder and CEO of Denver, Colorado-based Crescat Capital. The company, whose global macro fund returned 17.5 percent in October, has been adding wagers against the yuan with put options.
Also, the proxies may not follow the yuan perfectly all the time as they are also affected by domestic conditions. The Aussie, for example, jumped 0.5 percent last week, while the Chinese currency weakened.
Looking ahead, the proxies will likely weaken as the yuan may depreciate further amid risks that the trade war may escalate again, according to Mingze Wu, a Singapore-based foreign-exchange trader with Intl FCStone Global Payments. The yuan will slide to 7.5 per dollar by the end of next year, dragged down by slower growth in China, trade tensions and higher interest rates in developed nations, said Sue Trinh, head of Asia FX strategy at Royal Bank of Canada.
The onshore yuan rose 0.07 percent to 6.9509 per dollar as of 9:37 a.m. in Shanghai on Monday. It slid to as low as 6.9780 in late October, its weakest level since May 2008.

“Until now, we fail to make the euro as strong as the dollar,” Macron, speaking English, said in an interview with CNN broadcast on Sunday. “We made a great job during the past years but it’s not yet sufficient.”
For the French president, European corporations and entities are too dependent upon the U.S. currency. “This is an issue of sovereignty for me. So that’s why I want us to work very closely with our financial institutions, at the European levels and with all the partners, in order to build a capacity to be less dependent from the dollar,” he said.
“It doesn’t mean to be opponents -- but I think for the stability of the global order, you’ll need a strong currency like (the) dollar, but you need some alternatives. Euro has to be one of these alternatives, which means we have to better enhance our financial structures and the financing of our players at the euro-zone level,” Macron said.
Macron said the Chinese currency was a de facto alternative to the greenback, “not at the global level but for a certain region.”"
64,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 11, 2018 06:50PM ET</span>",Even Dollar Bears Are Wary of Betting Against Greenback Just Yet,"(Bloomberg) -- Dollar bears may want to hibernate this winter.
Although many currency strategists see the greenback resuming its downtrend in 2019, some are advising investors to keep their powder dry for now. The Bloomberg dollar index climbed as much as 0.4 percent Friday and was close to the more than 17-month high reached at the end of October. The greenback was helped by a decline in U.S. stocks and signals from the Federal Reserve that it doesn’t plan to budge from its tightening path.
It suggests the “king dollar” trend may have room to run, Valentin Marinov, head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), said in an interview. With the Fed expected to continue raising rates into 2019, the U.S. currency may remain strong well into the first quarter.
“You may see a gradual grind higher, even though it will fall well short of the lofty highs of late 2016, early 2017,” he said about the greenback. He emphasized that it will do best against currencies with more exposure to China, such as Australia’s and New Zealand’s, but warned “the dollar is close to peaking, and the longer-term risks 6 to 12 months out seem to be on the downside.”
Kit Juckes, global fixed-income strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), also doubts the dollar’s good vibes are drying up. Between the U.S. economy still running hot, a tightening labor market and a Fed that’s “unlikely to give any hint that they are approaching peak rates for several quarters,” dollar bears have plenty of hurdles to clear, Juckes said in a Nov. 8 note.
The currency is overvalued and market is positioned long, which suggests a correction is likely in 2019, Juckes wrote. In the meantime, however, he is “wary of jumping the gun.”
Ben Randol, senior director of currency strategy at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), expects the dollar will weaken next year as U.S. economic growth cools, he said in an interview. But it may find support from Brexit difficulties, the threat of deeper Italian fiscal crisis and U.S.-China trade tensions.
“Timing is very difficult,” Randol said “Given the risks, it can be a challenge to have conviction high enough to short the dollar.”
Turning Point
The turning point may arrive near the end of the first quarter when political risk bubbles up again around U.S. government spending, Credit Agricole’s Marinov said. Plus, the U.S. midterm election results may stymie additional fiscal stimulus measures. A pause in Fed rate hikes some time around the middle of 2019 and the start of rate increases in Europe could also factor in.
“We think that growth will moderate, especially given that the prospects for further aggressive fiscal stimulus may wane now that political gridlock has returned to Washington D.C. and the global growth headwinds have intensified,” he said.
By the end of next year, the euro could be back above $1.26 from around $1.13 at the end of last week, while the dollar-yen rate, which was close to 114, could be below 104, he said. That could see the dollar index return to levels last seen in late 2017 and early 2018, according to Marinov.

69,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 12:11AM ET</span>","Dollar supported by hawkish Fed, yen bounces after hitting five-week low","By Vatsal Srivastava
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar gained versus the euro and sterling on Friday as the U.S. Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady but reaffirmed its monetary tightening stance, setting the stage for a rate hike in December.
In foreign exchange markets, investor focus is now shifting back to the divergence between the monetary policies of the United States and other major economies, such as Japan where interest rates are seen staying extremely low. The yen, as a result, remains near a five-week low against the dollar.
The dollar index (DXY), a gauge of its performance against six major peers, traded at a fresh one-week high at 96.75. 
""The Fed looks set to raise rates in December. They have been largely unfazed by the equity market correction in October,"" said Ray Attrill, head of currency strategy at NAB.
Attrill added that the dollar strength also follows a weak euro and a jittery sterling over the last few trading sessions.
The Fed has raised its key policy rate three times this year, and the market expects another rate hike in December on the back of a robust U.S. economy, rising inflation and solid jobs growth.
According to the CME group's FedWatch tool, the likelihood of the Fed raising rates by another 25 basis points in December is 75 percent.
Analysts are also expecting more rate hikes by the Fed next year. 
""We anticipate two more hikes in 2019: one in March and one in June,"" Kevin Logan, chief U.S. economist at HSBC, said in a note. 
The yen  reversed course after hitting a five-week low versus the dollar to trade at 111.86 on Friday. 
The dollar has gained 2.24 percent versus the yen over the last 10 trading sessions due to the diverging monetary policies of the Fed and the Bank of Japan.
While the Fed is on track to raise interest rates, the BOJ is expected to keep its ultra loose monetary policy due to low growth and inflation.
The widening interest rate differential between U.S. and Japanese bonds has made the dollar a more attractive bet than the yen, which is often a funding currency for carry trades.
Meanwhile, the euro (EUR=) traded at $1.1342 on Friday, losing 0.18 percent versus the greenback. The single currency fell 0.54 percent on Thursday as traders reacted to negative news out of Europe.
The European Commission forecast on Thursday that the Italian economy would grow more slowly than Rome thinks in the next two years, leading to much bigger budget deficits than assumed by the new government.
The standoff between the EU and Rome over Italy's budget deficit and concerns over Europe's slowing economic growth have dragged the euro which has fallen 4.2 percent versus the dollar over the last six months.
The British pound  changed hands at $1.3049 on Friday, trading marginally lower versus the dollar. Sterling has gained 2.3 percent against the dollar in November.
The pound has benefited from growing investor expectations that Britain is close to reaching a deal with the European Union, less than five months before it is due to exit the bloc.

The Australian dollar  lost 0.21 percent to trade at $0.7241 as sentiment was dampened by worries about rising U.S.-Sino trade war tensions. China is Australia's largest trade partner and a weakening of sentiment toward China does not bode well for the Aussie dollar.

70,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 06:50PM ET</span>","Buy ‘Cheap’ Yen Before Its Big Awakening in 2019, SocGen Says","(Bloomberg) -- It’s time to start loading up on “cheap” yen.
Using options to bet on gains for Japan’s currency is a smart wager for 2019, according to  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN). The dollar rose to about 114 yen Thursday in New York, its strongest since early October, extending its advance after the Federal Reserve left rates unchanged and stayed on course to hike next month. The dollar set a 2018 high of about 114.50 yen on Oct. 4, which the bank cited as an area of technical resistance.
“On top of being a good entry point to buy yen, we think investors should consider rising risks of a sharp yen bounce in the medium term,” Olivier Korber, a currency derivatives strategist at SocGen, said in a research note Thursday.
The call for a yen rally dovetails with the firm’s assessment, laid out in a separate research piece Thursday, that the dollar is “overvalued.” Although SocGen said it’s wary of selling the greenback too soon because the U.S. economy is “still running hot,” the job market remains robust and the Fed is unlikely to signal a pause just yet, it sees a shift next year.
The result of the U.S. midterm elections, which produced a divided Congress, “supports the idea that the best quarter for economic growth in the current cycle will prove to be Q3 2018, and it’s all downhill from here,” Kit Juckes, a global fixed-income strategist at SocGen, wrote separately Thursday. “That suggests rates may peak next summer, at the same time as other, lagging central banks in Europe start raising rates.”
To wager on a stronger yen, Korber recommends buying an option structure known as an “appearing put spread,” expiring in a year. The structure includes the simultaneous purchase and sale of put options with different strike prices. One option has a feature that bets the yen won’t move below 100 per dollar over the lifetime of the structure.
Yen bulls will be looking for a pause in U.S. rate hikes by the Fed, expectations of Bank of Japan tightening or more risk aversion, he said.
“The potential for higher U.S. rates appears minimal compared with super low Japanese rates,” Korber wrote.

72,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 12:27PM ET</span>",Iran's economy to suffer but likely ride out U.S. sanctions storm,"By Parisa Hafezi and Jonathan Saul
DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Iran is likely to ride out the storm from U.S. oil sanctions, suffering recession but no economic meltdown, thanks to rising crude prices and deepening divisions between the United States and other major powers, officials and analysts say.
""Iran's situation is better than pre-2016 because of high oil prices and the fact that the U.S. is isolated this time,"" said a European diplomat who asked not to be further identified. 
Iran emerged in early 2016 from years of global sanctions under a deal with world powers that curbed its disputed nuclear program. But President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the deal in May, calling it flawed to Iran's advantage, and reimposed far-reaching U.S. sanctions in phases, with the most damaging oil and banking penalties taking effect on Nov. 5.
Trump aims to force Washington's longtime adversary to accept tougher restrictions on its nuclear activity, drop its ballistic missile program and scale back support for militant proxies in Middle East conflicts from Yemen to Syria.
But the broadly united front of world powers that enforced sanctions on Iran previously, pushing Iran into nuclear restraint, has unraveled since Trump took office and clashed with allies over everything from trade to collective security.
The other signatories to the nuclear deal - Germany, France, Britain, the European Union, Russia and China - have condemned Trump's walkout from the pact. The EU is preparing a special mechanism to enable payments for Iranian oil and other exports without U.S. dollars, possibly through a barter system. 
""It will be a difficult period but Iran's economy will withstand it for various reasons,"" a second diplomat said, ""including (the fact of) Russia being under (U.S. and EU)sanctions, Saudi Arabia having its own financial and political issues, and (trade war) between China and the United States."" 
Big power disunity and EU moves to circumvent Trump's sanctions regime have given Tehran a psychological boost - but not dissuaded foreign businesses ranging from oil majors to trading houses and shipping concerns from pulling out of Iran for fear of incurring new U.S. penalties.
RECESSION BUT NO MELTDOWN
Still, while the U.S. clampdown will probably trigger recession in Iran next year, economic meltdown should be avoided, with a reduced but still significant volume of oil exports continuing, a Fitch solutions analyst said.
""Tehran is still likely to see a substantial share of its foreign exchange earnings maintained,"" Andrine Skjelland told Reuters. ""This will enable Tehran to continue subsidizing imports of selected basic goods, keeping the costs of these down and thus limiting inflation to some extent."" 
In hopes of mitigating the immediate economic hit, Iranian authorities have hinted that Tehran might have to sell its oil at a discount to entice buyers going forward. 
""Oil revenues might decline but (they) will still be enough to run the country,"" said an official involved in Iran's international commerce. ""If we sell our oil for $1 less than market price, it will have tens of buyers.""
In another counter-measure made possible by state control of the oil sector, Iranian authorities are using special exchange centers to sell dollars at cheaper rates to importers of basic foods, medicine and other essential goods. 
IHS Markit senior economist Patrick Schneider doubted that Iran could cushion the economic blow in the near term.
""Despite the rhetoric and attempts to mitigate the downside effects..., uncertainty will remain prevalent for the next 6-12 months,"" he told Reuters. 
The International Monetary Fund has forecast that Iran's economy will contract in 2018 by 1.5 percent and by 3.6 percent in 2019 due to the dwindling of oil revenues. 
    At the same time the World Bank anticipates inflation in Iran jumping to 23.8 percent in 2018-19 from 9.6 percent in 2017-18, and to 31.2 percent in 2019-20.
DEFIANCE
But Iranian officials are defiant, citing Trump's isolation in repudiating the nuclear deal, climbing oil prices and Trump's agreement to grant sanctions waivers to eight countries especially dependent on Iranian crude.
    ""Crude prices are rising. Even if Iran's oil sales drop to 800,000 barrels per day (bpd), we will be able to run the economy. But we will send much more than that. Our economy will be far from collapse,"" said a senior Iranian official.
""Our budget is based on oil of $57 per barrel and is now over $75 per barrel.""
In October, Iran's crude exports were estimated at 1.82 million bpd by data intelligence company Kpler and 1.5 million bpd by another firm that traces Iranian shipments.
    Trump granted 180-day sanctions waivers to China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey, which together took in over 80 percent of Iran oil exports last year, Refinitiv Eikon data shows.   
    ""Even without the exemptions, we will sell our oil. We will bypass sanctions. We have so many countries that are on our side. America cannot do a damn thing,"" said a senior official close to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
The sanctions, however, will inevitably erode Iran's state finances and raise already high inflation and jobless rates, making life harder for ordinary Iranians.
Since May, when Trump took Washington out of the nuclear deal, prices of bread, cooking oil and other staples have soared and the value of the rial currency has plunged.
    The rial's weakness has sent prices of some imports rocketing, destroying jobs as some factories using imported parts have folded. Around 70 percent of small factories, businesses and workshops have begun to close down in the past few months due to scarcity of raw materials and hard currency, according to the Iranian state news agency IRNA.
    Moreover, Trump's sanctions against Iran's financial sector essentially make 30 banks and their subsidiaries off-limits to foreign lenders, undermining its means to facilitate trade.
Still, Iran demonstrated considerable resilience and ingenuity in coping with earlier international sanctions, and there is little to suggest Tehran could not do this again.

While ordinary Iranians struggled, Iran’s clerical and security establishment and business world sought kept the economy running by means including resorting to barter as well as foreign currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro fell on Thursday after the European Commission cut its forecasts for Italian growth, adding to investor concerns about the euro-zone's third-largest member's debts and economic outlook.
While the euro dipped, the dollar extended its recovery following a sigh of relief across markets after the U.S. midterm election results, and as investors turned their attention towards the Federal Reserve's policy meeting later on Thursday.
The European Commission forecast the Italian economy would grow more slowly in the next two years than Rome thinks, making government budget deficits much higher than assumed by Italy, and supporting the Commission's view that Italy's 2019 draft budget breaks European Union fiscal rules.
The announcement sent the euro, which was up marginally on the day, into negative territory. It traded 0.2 percent lower at $1.1404 (EUR=) by 1135 GMT, at the day's lows.
""The Italian situation continues to pressure the euro,"" said Alvin Tan, an FX Strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
Tan said that adding to euro weakness was the dollar's rebound thanks to U.S. midterm election results that ""were in line with expectations and mean the Fed can go on its way"" in raising interest rates. 
Democrats won control of the House of Representatives in the vote while the Republicans cemented their majority in the Senate, resulting in a split U.S. Congress. 
The dollar pulled further away from 2-1/2 week lows hit on Wednesday.
The Fed is expected to keep interest rates on hold but signal further tightening in December and 2019.
The dollar index (DXY) nudged up 0.3 percent to 96.251. It had hit as low as 95.678 on Wednesday.
""Over the coming weeks and months the market will have to draw its own conclusion about how far the hiking cycle in the U.S. will go, based on the continuation of the U.S. fiscal and trade policy under the new conditions in Congress and the economic data,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analysts said in a note. 
""That means that in particular positive wage, price and labor market data might provide support for the dollar.""
More broadly, analysts said foreign exchange traders were treading cautiously and looking for their next cue on the strength of the global economy, despite world stocks racking up their longest winning streak of 2018 on Thursday. The dollar gained 0.2 versus the Japanese yen to 113.72 . The dollar has gained over the past week versus the yen due to the diverging monetary policies of the U.S. Fed and the Bank of Japan.
The New Zealand dollar  slipped slightly, by 0.1 percent to $0.6774, but was little moved by its central bank keeping rates on hold at 1.75 percent on Thursday. The Australian dollar  built on recent gains to trade at $0.7284, up 0.2 percent and within touching distance of a six-week high. 

The Aussie was cheered by stronger than expected trade data out of China, Australia's largest trading partner.

78,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 11:26AM ET</span>",Dollar dips after midterm election splits power in U.S. Congress,"By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar edged lower on Wednesday, with some investors tiptoeing back into riskier assets after midterm elections split power in the U.S. Congress, giving Democrats greater ability to check any major initiatives from President Donald Trump.
Traders pulled out of the safe-haven currency after the election results came in as expected. Some had worried that political instability might ensue if either party had won full control. 
""There was this expectation that if we didn’t get a divided Congress, we might see risk sentiment becoming a little shaky, but since that didn’t happen we have a risk-on move,"" said Mazen Issa, senior foreign exchange strategist at TD Securities in New York. 
The greenback has been the surprise winner in the global currency markets this year after Trump and congressional Republicans passed a significant tax cut, and strong economic growth prompted the U.S. Federal Reserve to start steadily raising interest rates.
Market watchers believe the outcome of the U.S. midterm, with Democrats taking the House of Representatives and Republicans keeping control of the Senate, would make further tax cuts and deregulation unlikely for now. 
""For the dollar, there are fewer fiscal initiatives like tax reform to drive sentiment higher. Any sort of fiscal stimulus is less likely to be observed over the next two years,"" said Issa. 
Prospects of less fiscal stimulus would also relieve the pressure on the Fed to keep raising interest rates and add downward pressure on U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar.
Some analysts had said a fully Republican Congress could have meant increased trade tension and a larger deficit. 
Against a basket of other currencies (DXY), the dollar slipped 0.16 percent on the day, last at 95.838, its lowest level in two weeks. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note  was down 2.5 basis points, last at 3.189 percent. 
Equity markets rallied as investors pushed funds into riskier assets, and on hopes that the reduced likelihood of more fiscal stimulus would bring the end to a multi-year U.S. rate hike cycle.
The euro (EUR=) gained half a percent to trade at $1.148. The single currency changed hands more than 1 percent above this year's trough of $1.1301 reached on Aug. 15.

91,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 09:10PM ET</span>","Aussie, NZ dollars to stick to recent ranges near-term as headwinds persist: Reuters poll","By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Foreign exchange analysts broadly stuck to their predictions for the Australian and New Zealand dollars while expecting a small rebound for the badly battered currencies over a 12-month horizon.
A Reuters survey of 42 analysts saw median predictions for the Aussie at $0.7100  on a one-month horizon, from $0.7200 in the previous poll and Monday's close of $0.7210.
Analysts marginally trimmed their projections for 3 and 6 months to $0.7200 and $0.7300 while the outlook for 12 months remained unchanged at $0.7500.
Such expectations come amid renewed downward pressure on the Australian currency, which has shed almost 8 percent since the start of the year to hit a 2-1/2 year trough of $0.7021 just last month. 
The trade-exposed currency has been used by investors to wager on, or hedge against, tensions in emerging markets and the risks to the Chinese economy from U.S. tariffs.
A sudden surge in U.S. bond yields and hawkish commentary from the Federal Reserve has also driven the U.S. dollar higher more broadly. In contrast, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has repeatedly stated that its rates will remain at historic lows for some time to come.
Many analysts had long predicted a steep fall in the Aussie but the currency had found support from a run of strong local data and fund flows from carry trades. That was until the spectre of the Sino-U.S. trade war sent it falling to test 70 U.S. cents in recent weeks.
""The long awaited squeeze in the AUD is materializing,"" said Daniel Been, head of FX Research at ANZ which has a bearish view on the Aussie.
""The domestic data flow is positive, but this is ...largely priced in. Importantly, the global environment continues to dominate moves, and we see a number of risk events ahead namely U.S.-China tension, Brexit, U.S. mid-term elections, that could take a toll on the Australian dollar.""
ANZ is among only a handful of analysts in the Reuters poll to forecast a fall under $0.7000. It sees the Aussie at $0.6900 in three months and $0.6800 in six. 
For the kiwi, analysts staunchly held to their predictions for $0.6600 for one-, three- and six-months out and then a slight uptick to $0.6800 in a year's time. 
The currency was last trading at $0.6658 , above the $0.6481 seen in the previous poll.
The downside risk was perceived as greater, though, with forecasts stretching as low at $0.6081 on a six-month view.
The kiwi has lost about 6 percent of its value so far this year with a run of weaker-than-expected economic data including sagging business confidence weighing on the currency. 
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has also signaled that the next move in rates could be a cut if economic indicators disappoint. 
""The risk that soft New Zealand business confidence translates into weaker activity cannot be fully ignored, and this may encourage the RBNZ to sound more cautious, and undermine New Zealand dollar,"" Joseph Capurso, currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank said. 
""Global risks also suggest more downside risks to New Zealand’s growth and inflation outlook.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar stuck to tight ranges against its major rivals on Tuesday as investors favored caution ahead of U.S. midterm elections later in the day.
The U.S. congressional election is widely expected to boost the Democratic Party, which has a strong chance of winning control of the House of Representatives, with Republicans seen likely to keep the Senate.
""Markets are increasingly pricing in the possibility of a victory for the Republicans - even in the House,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities.
A Republican victory in both chambers was likely to boost the U.S. dollar, Yamamoto said. But a sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields following the elections might lead to selling of U.S. equities.
""If there will be another big round of sell-offs in the U.S. equity market, then I think that's not necessarily positive for the dollar,"" he said.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the performance of the greenback against six key rivals, was basically flat at 96.319, moving in a range between 96.315 and 96.334. It hit a 16-month high of 97.20 last week.
The euro (EUR=) was slightly higher at $1.1411, about one percent above this year's trough of $1.1301 touched on Aug. 15.
Euro zone finance ministers called on Italy overnight to change its 2019 budget to conform with European Union rules before a deadline set for next week, but Rome dug in its heels saying its disputed deficit plan would not change.
Against the yen <JPY=>, the dollar changed hands 0.1 percent higher at 113.27 yen, close to a four-week high of 113.385 yen reached last week.
The Australian dollar <AUD=D4> held steady at $0.7211 as traders awaited a monetary policy decision from Australia's central bank due at 0330 GMT.
The Aussie traded 2.7 percent above a more than two-and-a-half-year low of $0.7021 touched on Oct. 26.
The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to extend its record spell of steady rates well into next year, according to a Reuters poll published on Monday.
All but one of the 39 analysts polled expected the RBA to hold rates at 1.50 percent at Tuesday's policy meeting, the poll found.

The pound <GBP=D4> rose 0.1 percent to $1.3063, trading just off a two-week high of $1.3070 hit earlier in the session after a media report suggested the E.U. and Britain may be inching closer to an orderly Brexit.

93,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>","UK's Hammond says growth, not budget surplus, key to reduce debt","By David Milliken and Alistair Smout
LONDON (Reuters) - British finance minister Philip Hammond raised the prospect of looser budget policy after Brexit and said faster growth was the best way to cut Britain's debt burden, but insisted he was still committed to ultimately running a budget surplus.
Hammond's annual budget last week reinforced some analysts' doubts about his commitment to a budget surplus, after he used a tax windfall to fund public spending commitments rather than to make faster progress at reducing public debt.
Prime Minister Theresa May said last month that austerity was ending after a series of cuts to public services and welfare benefits since 2010, and had previously announced a big rise in public healthcare spending.
The non-partisan Institute for Fiscal Studies said Hammond's actions suggested that the idea he really intended to eliminate the budget deficit by the mid-2020s was ""surely for the birds"".
Asked by a parliamentary committee if the Treasury had given up on the prospect of running a budget surplus in the next decade, Hammond said: ""No, it hasn't been abandoned.""
However, he declined to say when he expected a surplus. Budget forecasts last week showed government borrowing as a share of national income on track to fall to 0.8 percent in 2023/24 from a lower-than-expected 1.2 percent -- or 25.5 billion pounds ($33.3 billion) -- this financial year.
""We are within touching distance (of a surplus), but it will be a policy decision at successive fiscal events how to balance whatever available fiscal headroom there is between reducing the deficit, reducing taxes, increasing spending ... and investing in capital infrastructure,"" he told legislators.
Government borrowing is already forecast to rise to 1.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) next year, and Hammond said he could borrow more after Britain leaves the European Union on March 29 next year and still meet budget rules.
""We could, if we chose to, allow borrowing to rise a little,"" Hammond said.
Hammond said finding a way to boost sluggish growth was likely to be a more viable strategy to rapidly reduce debt as a share of GDP than persistently running budget surpluses, which Britain has rarely managed in previous decades. 
""There's a very hard way of doing it, which is running a budget surplus every year and paying off the cash debt,"" he said. ""And there's a much easier way of doing it, which is (to) get the economy growing faster.""

Total public sector net debt is forecast to fall to 83.7 percent of GDP this year, or 1.835 trillion pounds.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.24% to 96.31.
ISM nonmanufacturing data for October showed a reading of 60.3, below the record-setting reading seen last month, but still above expectations.
The services sector is critical component of the US economy, accounting for roughly 80% of U.S. private-sector gross domestic product (GDP).
The upbeat data was overshadowed by expectations that the U.S. mid-term elections Tuesday, will result in divided Congress, with Democrats tipped to take control of the House.
The midterms and the Federal Reserve policy action later in the week ""are significant enough in terms of event risk to keep investors sitting on their hands,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist, at Scotia Capital.

""I would expect us to no longer need to hold the kind of level of headroom against meeting our fiscal rule in 2021 and indeed, it's not just a single year - we've got a profile of headroom against that metric across the whole five year period.

97,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 11:21AM ET</span>",The 8 million pound hole in Brexit: smoking gun or damp squib?,"By Guy Faulconbridge
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's serious crime agency has started an investigation into Brexit backer Arron Banks over the source of 8 million pounds ($10.4 million) in loans to groups including Leave.EU which campaigned to leave the European Union.
WHY DO WE CARE?
Banks has said the investigation is part of an attempt to undermine Brexit. He has repeatedly insisted that the money came from him and that no Russian funding was involved.
But if criminal offences or foreign funding are proven, that could cast doubt on the legitimacy of the whole Brexit vote.
The groups that received the loans ran emotive publicity campaigns to persuade people to vote to leave the EU - and the final result was close. In the June 23, 2016 referendum, 17.4 million voters, or 51.9 percent, backed Brexit while 16.1 million, or 48.1 percent, backed staying in the bloc.
WHAT IS THE INVESTIGATION ABOUT?
The focus is 8 million pounds in loans provided to Leave.EU and Better for the Country Limited (BFTC), which Banks controls and which ran Leave.EU's campaign.
Britain's Electoral Commission asked the UK National Crime Agency to investigate Banks after saying it suspected the insurance entrepreneur was ""not the true source"" of the loans.
It also said it had grounds to suspect that the loan arrangements had involved Banks' Rock Holding Limited, which was incorporated in the Isle of Man, a self-governing British crown dependency that is not part of the United Kingdom. 
British law mostly bans companies from outside UK from making such political donations. 
The Electoral Commission said it suspected criminal offences were committed, specifically relating to the transactions which led to the 8 million pounds being paid into BFTC's bank account.
WHAT DOES BANKS SAY?
Banks said the money was his and came from his UK-incorporated Rock Services insurance firm and was generated from insurance business written in the UK.
He has said that the Electoral Commission's issues about Rock Holdings are based on a misunderstanding about its status - that it is a holding company that owns Rock Services and did not itself provide the loans.
""Rock Holdings is a company I own and control and I’m a U.K. tax payer, no Russian or foreign money has ever come into it,"" he told Reuters. 
Banks, who was pictured with Donald Trump and leading Brexiteer Nigel Farage outside a gilded elevator soon after Trump’s 2016 U.S. presidential election victory, said he welcomed the inquiry.
""I am confident that a full and frank investigation will finally put an end to the ludicrous allegations leveled against me and my colleagues,"" he said.
RUSSIAN LINKS?
After the announcement of the investigation, Damian Collins, chair of the British Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said it is unclear where Banks got the 8 million pounds.
Collins' committee said Banks had misled it over the number of meetings he had with the Russian embassy in London.
Banks said at the time that he had no business interests in Russia and had done no business deals in Russia. Russia has denied any involvement in Brexit.
WHAT NEXT?
It is unclear how long the National Crime Agency's investigation will take. The United Kingdom is due to leave the EU on March 29, at 11:00 p.m. London time.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar paused after three consecutive weeks of gains as investors took profits before U.S. midterm elections this week that may fuel a bout of volatility for global markets, with the British pound leading gains on Brexit deal breakthrough hopes.
Notwithstanding a dollar selloff in the second half of last week, hedge funds added to their dollar holdings taking net long positions to its biggest levels since Dec. 2016 as latest data have encouraged more bullish bets.
But market analysts warn that an unexpected outcome at the midterm elections could trigger a massive unwind of long dollar positions and undermine the greenback which has rallied more than 7 percent from April lows against its rivals.
Tuesday’s U.S. congressional election is widely expected to help the Democratic Party, who have a strong chance of winning control of the U.S. House of Representatives, with Republicans likely to keep the Senate.
""On the contrary, if the Republicans put up a strong showing, that could give President Trump a freer hand and he could step up his criticism of the Fed which may hurt the dollar,"" said Ricardo Evangelista, a senior analyst at ActivTrades Plc in London.
The dollar index (DXY) was down 0.1 percent at 96.39. It hit a June 2017 high of 97.20 last week.
Speculators added to their net long U.S. dollar bets, taking the value of the net long dollar position to $26.74 billion in the week ended Oct. 30, nearing its highest level since Dec. 2016, according to latest futures data.
Friday's data showed that U.S. jobs growth rebounded sharply in October and wages recorded their largest annual gain in 9-1/2 years, pushing U.S. Treasury yields on ten-year maturities  to 3.2 percent on Monday.
Broader moves in the currency markets were muted with only the British pound the big gainer as expectations grew that Britain and the European Union are inching closer to a deal.
The currency was lifted by a report over the weekend that said an all-UK customs deal will be written into the legally binding agreement governing Britain's withdrawal from the European Union. 
EURO STRUGGLES
The strong U.S. data also brought into prominence the diverging trends between a robust U.S. economy and its struggling European counterpart with a Citibank economic monitor <.CESIEUR> showing the European index near 2018 lows.
Recent dovish comments from senior policymakers such as Finnish central bank chief Olli Rehn have raised some hopes that the European Central Bank could extend a new set of long-term loans to the bank sector.
Though ECB policymakers said last week that new targeted long-term refinancing operations are an option that may be considered in due time, sources have told Reuters that a new round of loans is not imminent.
The single currency (EUR=EBS) softened 0.1 percent to $1.1378. 
""The latest news heightens the downside risk to the euro from weaker economic data for a while,"" said John Marley at FX risk management specialist, Smart Currency Business. 
Latest headlines from Italy were hardly conciliatory as eurozone finance ministers to meet later in the day with discussion of Italy’s budget high on their agenda.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said the country’s budget deficit expansion could be a model for the rest of the EU to match U.S. fiscal stimuli and encourage investment growth.              
Ulrich Leuchtmann, an FX strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said the latest comments from Italy suggest the government is not going to give in to the conflict with Brussels.

""There is a high risk of this conflict escalating,"" he said.

Business activity in the UK service sector grew at the slowest pace in seven months in October, data on Monday showed, held back by heightened economic uncertainty over Brexit and wider fears over the global economic outlook.
The report, taken together with similar surveys of the manufacturing and construction sectors indicated that the rate of economic growth could slow sharply in the fourth quarter.

With talks at an impasse five months before Britain exits the European Union, investors are growing anxious and sterling is moving sharply on any news of a possible breakthrough.
The currency has faltered in seven of the 10 months of this year so far, losing as much as 3.6 percent. 
But it traded up 0.3 percent on Monday to reach a 10-day high versus the dollar of $1.3065 . Versus the euro (EURGBP=D3) it climbed to 87.33 pence, its highest since Oct. 11. 
The currency was lifted by a report over the weekend that said an all-UK customs deal will be written into the legally binding agreement governing Britain's withdrawal from the European Union. 
That would mean an Irish ""backstop"" deal to avoid a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, is not required, the Times reported. The issue has been the main stumbling bloc to London and Brussels agreeing a deal.
""We think EUR/GBP could be embarking on a sustainable bear trend – largely on the back of the deteriorating EUR outlook,"" ING's head of FX strategy Chris Turner said in a client note.
""Any news this week that the EU would hold a Brexit summit in November would be greeted positively,"" he added. 
The pound enjoyed its best day of the year against the dollar on Thursday.
It was aided by optimism for a Brexit deal and after the Bank of England signaled more interest rate hikes could be on the way if Britain's exit from the European Union is smooth. 
An agreement with Brussels on the terms of divorce would remove a major uncertainty overshadowing the economy and the BoE as it tries to curb inflation.
The British government and EU officials have this week played down hopes for an imminent Brexit deal, emphasising that while an agreement is close the two sides still have work to do.

Any agreement with Brussels would then need to win approval from British parliamentarians before Britain's scheduled departure date of March 29, a far from easy process given factions with Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative party oppose her proposals for a Brexit agreement.

106,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 02, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar Inches Higher; Sterling Set for Best Week Since March,"Investing.com - The dollar rose against its rivals Thursday after data showed the U.S. economy created more jobs than expected last month, strengthening the Federal Reserve's case to continue gradually raising rates.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.31% to 96.57.
The Labor Department said Friday nonfarm payroll employment increased by 250,000 jobs in October, beating economists' estimates for 193,000 new jobs. While the unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.7%.
Average hourly earnings rose 0.2% month on month and 3.1% for the year through October, in line with economists' forecasts.
The better-than-expected jobs data keeps the Fed on track for another hike in December, leading to a tightening cycle that could slightly overshoot the neutral rate over time, TD Securities said.
""The data offers a boost to the dollar, though we think markets will be cautious to push this narrative with positioning stretched and event risk related to the US mid-terms next week,"" it added.
The dollar held firm against safe-haven yen despite a selloff on Wall Street as investors fretted about U.S.-China trade tensions. White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow refuted reports that President Donald Trump had asked his Cabinet to put together a trade deal with China.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar made modest gains against the yen on Friday, boosted by upbeat U.S. jobs data, but gains were limited by hopes that Washington and Beijing can repair the trade tensions that have spurred safe-haven buying of the greenback.
U.S. job growth rebounded sharply in October and wages recorded their largest annual gain in 9-1/2 years, which could keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates in December.
""Even though we had a pretty strong payrolls report, it still seems like the dollar's gains were somewhat muted,"" said Sireen Harajli, foreign exchange strategist at Mizuho in New York.
The dollar was 0.28 percent higher against the yen, while the euro was up 0.02 percent against the greenback.
""I think we might be seeing some signs that dollar gains are starting to become somewhat limited at these levels,"" she said.
The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback versus the euro, yen, sterling and three other currencies, hit a 16-month high on Wednesday. On Friday, the index was little changed on the day at 96.355.
The strong jobs numbers did not boost the dollar more since investors remained focused on trade-related tensions, said Juan Perez, senior currency trader with Tempus, Inc. in Washington.
The greenback draws safe haven flows during times of economic and political uncertainty. It came under pressure on Friday, after a Bloomberg report said President Donald Trump was seeking a trade agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping before a meeting in Argentina at the end of November.
A trade dispute between the world's two largest economies has cast a pall over the global economy and boosted demand for the greenback as investors view the United States to be in better shape than its rivals to weather a trade war.
A senior Trump administration official dismissed the report of a possible trade deal with China as untrue, a CNBC reporter said in a post on Twitter.
Improved risk sentiment provided support to commodity-linked currencies, including the Aussie and the kiwi, said Perez.
The Australian dollar , seen as a proxy for China-related trades as well as a barometer of broader risk sentiment, was about flat on the day.
The offshore yuan  was trading at 6.89 per dollar as of 1445 GMT after surging to a high of 6.8525, its strongest level since Sept. 24.
Sterling  was down 0.3 percent on the day, but on pace for its biggest weekly gain since March. The pound was aided this week after the Bank of England signaled more interest rate hikes could be on the way if Britain's exit from the European Union is smooth.

The Canadian dollar  dipped from an earlier one-week high against the greenback after investors deemed domestic jobs and trade data not strong enough to raise bets for another Bank of Canada interest rate hike next month.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was flat at 96.28 as of 11:04 AM ET (15:04 GMT).
The greenback rose briefly after the jobs report data, but was flat soon after. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 250,000 in October, higher than the consensus forecast. The jobless rate was also steady, while average hourly earnings advanced 0.2%, as expected.
The positive report supports the case for the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates in December, which is likely to put pressure on gold. Chances of a December rate hike are priced in at 77.6%, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Meanwhile, trade tensions weighed, as reports suggested that a trade deal with China is not likely.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke on the phone regarding trade on Thursday, boosting sentiment that a trade deal will be reached when the two meet at G-20 summit later this month.

The lira , which has recovered from a slump to record lows in August, briefly strengthened beyond 5.4200 against the dollar by 1415 GMT from Thursday's close of 5.51.
It is currently down 30 percent against the U.S. currency this year, having been hit by concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan's influence over monetary policy and a diplomatic spat between Ankara and Washington.
In a sign of improved relations, the United States on Friday lifted sanctions imposed on Turkey's justice and interior ministers, three weeks after Turkey freed an American pastor from detention.
Shortly after the announcement, Turkey lifted sanctions on U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen and Attorney General Jeff Sessions which Ankara had imposed in retaliation for the sanctions on its ministers.
The U.S. government has agreed to let eight countries, including close allies South Korea and Japan, as well as India, keep buying Iranian oil after it reimposes sanctions on Tehran from next week, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing a U.S. official.
Turkey has not received written notification regarding any waiver on buying Iranian oil but it has heard rumors on the issue, Turkish Energy Minister Fatih Donmez said in Ankara when asked about the issue.
""The statement by the energy minister created the perception that Turkey might be one of the eight countries that is included in the Iran sanctions waiver,"" said one banker.
Turkey, among the major importers of Iranian crude, has resisted calls by Washington to end their oil purchases as winter looms in a country largely dependent on foreign resources for its energy needs.
Washington will reintroduce the sanctions targeting Iranian oil on Monday. U.S. officials have said the United States does not want to harm friends and allies dependent on the oil.
The Borsa Istanbul BIST100 index (XU100) was up 1 percent.

110,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2018 09:00AM ET</span>",Basket case: euro strength blunts export boost potential,"By Sujata Rao and Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - A slump in the euro zone's biggest trading partners' currencies this year is blunting any boost that the euro's weakness versus the dollar could provide the region's exporters.
Two months before the European Central Bank is scheduled to begin winding up its crisis-era bond-buying program, the task is being complicated by signs that the bloc's economic momentum is running out of steam, and the euro is not helping.
While the single currency's 5 percent drop against the dollar (EUR=) in 2018 has captured the headlines, in ""effective"" terms it is roughly flat since January and close to four-year highs.
That is according to an ECB-compiled index  that comprises the weighted average of the euro versus a basket of the bloc's 19 main trading partners.
GRAPHIC: Weights of trading partner countries in the euro's effective exchange rate - https://tmsnrt.rs/2OFFqai
Shifting trade patterns have diminished the dollar's role in the euro's trade-weighted basket to 17 percent from 22 percent in 2003.
By contrast, emerging currencies account for more than half, led by China's yuan on around 23 percent, up from sub-10 percent in 2003.
Hit by the United States's trade levies, the yuan has fallen across the board; against the euro it has lost 6 percent (EURCNY=) since June and around 1 percent since January.
That undermines the ECB's desire for a weaker euro to help stir stubbornly low inflation and support exporters at a time when slowing global growth momentum and trade tensions are dampening demand.
GRAPHIC: Euro flat year-to-date in ""effective"" terms - https://tmsnrt.rs/2OXOnMr
Many economists expect the ECB to lower its growth forecasts at its December policy meeting.
""What is under-appreciated is that there's been a massive break between euro trade-weighted and euro-dollar, and it's the former that really matters for the export sector,"" said Tim Graf,  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors' head of EMEA macro strategy.
""On that basis the euro is actually very strong because of Brexit, yuan depreciation and Turkey. The lira alone added 0.7 pct to the trade-weighted euro basket,"" Graf said, referring to the summer selloff that saw the lira hit record lows.
To be sure, a sturdy euro is not the main worry for ECB policymakers grappling with fading economic momentum and ructions in Italian bond markets.
Marchel Alexandrovich, an economist at Jefferies, said the euro was ""not something the ECB is going to lose sleep over"", arguing that a stronger currency may prove a bigger concern after quantitative easing ends.
But the euro's strength comes as worries about growth increase - euro zone economic expansion slowed in the third quarter, and third-biggest member Italy stagnated.
Negative economic surprises, according to Citi's barometer, have gathered steam. <.CESIEUR>
While overall consumer price growth in the euro zone accelerated last month to 2.2 percent, the closely watched ""core"" inflation rate stood at 1.3 percent. The bank's inflation target is 2 percent.
A key gauge of markets' long-term inflation expectations is also near its lowest in a year.  
Policymakers hope higher wages will fuel a rise in inflation soon.
ECB president Mario Draghi played down growth concerns last week, noting ""weaker momentum, not a downturn,"" and sticking to plans to exit stimulus at year-end.

""They don't have much wiggle room, because anything hawkish will strengthen the euro and they just won't want that with export growth starting to moderate,"" said State Street's Graf.

Italy's government has drawn up a draft budget for 2019 that includes a budget deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP. The European Commission has rejected it, saying the deficit is too high, and has called on Rome to change its fiscal plans.
""I do not see that danger because no one commits suicide,"" Juncker told Austrian broadcaster ORF when asked if Italy would abandon the euro, but he did expect fallout from the budget dispute. 
""For the first time someone is saying the (EU budget) rules are of no interest to us. That will have consequences,"" he said.
Asked what those consequences were, he said Rome has to answer the Commission's questions by mid-November ""and then we will see"".

""Many Italians want to remain a member of the European Union, a growing number of Italians also clearly support the euro because Italians ... notice, feel, know, sense that the euro protects them, too. And in terms of arguments we will move in that direction,"" he said.

114,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>",Shorting the Yuan Is a Top Play for This Investor,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s currency is bound for a steady grind lower as its officials oversee an orderly depreciation to support a slowing economy, according to a former Tudor Investment Corp. trader.
Shorting the yuan, is one of the biggest trades going for Brett Gillespie, who’s building macro funds at Ellerston Capital Ltd. after working at Tudor Investment Group for more than 11 years. He sees it slipping beyond the 7-per-dollar level that traders have focused on lately, taking it to the weakest since the earlier part of the global financial crisis.
“We’re positioned for dollar-CNH to go higher -- but we don’t think it’s going to be an explosive move,” Gillespie said in an interview Wednesday in his office in Sydney, using the currency ticker for the yuan traded offshore. Given Chinese authorities’ wariness about disorderly currency moves that rekindle worries about large capital outflows, the yuan is more likely to see a “grinding” move weaker, he said.
The onshore yuan traded at 6.9659 per dollar on Wednesday, within about half a percentage point of 7; the offshore rate was at 6.9698. Gillespie said he’s using options with trades structured to expire at the end of January to early February, a period when the next stage of U.S. trade sanctions may be in focus.
While Gillespie said that options pricing suggests traders see a swift move toward 7.3 or 7.4 per dollar for the yuan if it passes 7, that’s unlikely in his view. “You get really cheap trades” for more modest declines past 7, he said.
Read Goldman’s take on the yuan and the likelihood of reaching 7 per dollar.
Gillespie said U.S. Vice President Mike Pence’s Oct. 4 keynote speech criticizing China across security and economic fields loomed large in his outlook on relations between the world’s top two economies.
“That moved it from a trade war to a Cold War,” Gillespie said. “That might sound dramatic, but this is now a much more longer-term battle. The Chinese accepted that after the Pence speech.”
With China’s economy slowing and no trade deal likely to be in the offing, “they are going to try and let the currency help in this growth support,” said Gillespie, who manages about A$370 million ($262 million) across his funds.
“Seven is not a magic number -- it’s no longer that important,” he said. “What is important, is that the move is orderly and that you don’t create a dam-breaking type effect if you move through.”"

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.89% to 96.04.
ISM manufacturing data  for October showed a decline to a reading of 57.7, down from 58.8 last month and below expectations for a reading of 59. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the U.S. economy.
The dollar was also weighed down by a surge in sterling on reports that London is close to securing a financial services deal with the EU.

Sterling built on early gains, with GBP/USD up 1.46% to 1.2950.
The pound was bolstered by reports that the UK and the EU are close to a deal that will allow UK financial services companies based in the UK to have continued access to European markets after Brexit, although reports were played down in London and Brussels.
Sterling received an additional boost after the Bank of England indicated that there are scenarios where interest rates could still need to rise in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The BoE left interest rates on hold in a unanimous decision earlier Thursday and warned that uncertainty over Brexit is weighing on the economy.
The euro was sharply lower against the pound, with EUR/GBP down 0.77% to 0.8809.

117,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>","Canada dollar to rally as global gloom lifts, say strategists: Reuters poll","By Fergal Smith
TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar will rally over coming months on a recovery in demand for riskier assets and as a solid domestic economy supports more interest rate hikes from a hawkish central bank, according to a Reuters poll.
The poll of more than 40 currency market strategists predicted the currency would climb to C$1.2850 to the greenback in three months from the C$1.3150 it was trading at on Wednesday.
The currency is expected to climb to C$1.2600 in a year, weaker than the C$1.2500 forecast in October's poll.
The Canadian dollar declined 1.9 percent in October, its worst monthly performance since February, as optimism after a deal to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement was overshadowed by a plunge in global stocks.
Over the same month, the U.S. dollar (DXY) climbed 2 percent against a basket of major currencies.
""The loonie is currently penalized by investors' low risk appetite,"" said Hendrix Vachon, senior economist at Desjardins. ""This situation is not expected to last, as the economic fundamentals are still encouraging.""
Global equities have been pressured by a trade war between the world's two largest economies, the United States and China.
Canada runs a current account deficit and is a major exporter of commodities, including oil, so its economy could be hurt if the global flow of trade or capital slows.
In October, oil prices posted the worst monthly performance since mid-2016 amid worries about the outlook for demand and evidence of rising global crude supply.
To make matters worse for Canada, the price of its heavy crude traded at a record discount to U.S. oil during the month due to pipeline congestion. The differential slumped to more than $50 before recovering some ground, according to Shorcan Energy Brokers.
Still, the Bank of Canada was encouraged enough last week by prospects for the economy to lift its key interest rate to 1.75 percent. It said the rate would need to rise further to a neutral stance of about 3 percent to achieve its inflation target, and opened the door to a faster pace of tightening.
Economists in a separate Reuters poll this week expected the central bank to raise interest rates three times next year.
The Canadian dollar should attract support from a ""fairly hawkish Bank of Canada,"" said Erik Nelson, a currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC). ""Canadian growth remains above potential, driven by solid domestic demand, while the resolution of NAFTA uncertainty should help rebalance the economy toward investment rather than consumer spending.""
Canada's economy will continue to grow faster than its potential over the coming quarters as U.S. fiscal stimulus boosts demand for its exports, a Reuters poll of economists showed last month.
Still, Canada's productivity and credit growth face a threat from a flattening yield curve as it makes it less appealing to invest in long-term projects, and less still if the Bank of Canada meets its goal of a 3 percent interest rate.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro rebounded from 2-1/2 month lows on Thursday as currencies hit hard by recent dollar buying roared higher, with the mood for risk-taking starting the month on a much more positive footing. 
Analysts said a flood of end-of-month buying of dollars on Wednesday had ceased with the start of November. 
That, combined with hopes that China would ramp up fiscal stimulus, boosted the euro and led to substantial moves higher in the Australian and New Zealand dollars, the Norwegian and Swedish crowns and a clutch of emerging market currencies. 
A more than one percent increase in sterling  on hopes of an EU-UK Brexit deal for financial services also added to the dollar's woes, leaving it on track for its biggest one-day loss in three weeks.
""We are doing the opposite from what we were doing yesterday. We've got a reasonably risk-friendly market, and with the new month we have some dollar selling,"" said Kit Juckes, a strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
The euro rose to as high as $1.1389 (EUR=), away from recent lows of $1.1302 that had followed weak euro zone data and worries about the Italian budget.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback's value versus six major peers, moved lower by 0.5 percent to 96.642, easing from a 16-month high of 97.2 hit on Wednesday. 
The Australian dollar , seen as a barometer of investor sentiment, jumped one percent to $0.7146, helped by data showing a strong rise in the country's trade surplus.
The New Zealand dollar gained 1.4 percent  while the Swedish  and Norwegian crowns  also made headway.
The yen  rose slightly to 112.90. The Japanese currency weakened to a three-week low of 113.38 on Wednesday after the Bank of Japan signaled its intention to maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy for some time.
EM RECOVERY
With investor risk sentiment improving, emerging market currencies racked up gains versus the dollar. The offshore Chinese yuan, which had skidded to a 22-month low this week, recovered nearly half a percent to 6.9456 . 
The Russian rouble (RUB=), Turkish lira  and South Africa rand  rallied, the latter up 1.7 percent. 
Despite the dollar's slide, some analysts were cautious about further falls given the headwinds for the global economy.
Friday's U.S. employment data could also reinforce the view that the U.S. economy is outperforming rivals, sending money back into the buck.
""After a very difficult month of October for risk assets, overnight we saw across the board strength in EM (emerging market) and higher beta FX, partly helped by the announcement of Chinese stimulus,"" ING analysts said in a note to clients.

GBP/USD was up 1.17% to 1.2916 by 04:40 AM ET (08:40 AM GMT), the highest level in just over a week.
Reuters reported that the UK and the EU are close to a deal that will allow UK financial services companies based to have some access to European markets after Brexit.
The Times newspaper reported that a tentative deal had been struck.
The reports came ahead of the Bank of England’s latest interest rate decision later in the day, with the bank widely expected to keep monetary policy on hold amid uncertainty over the economic impact of Brexit.
Sterling rose to one-and-a-half week highs against the euro, with EUR/GBP down 0.73% to 0.88.12.
The euro was higher against the softer dollar, with EUR/USD advancing 0.59% to 1.1378.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.57% to 96.35 after gaining 2.28% in October.
The dollar has been boosted by expectations for a faster pace of rate hikes from the Federal Reserve going into 2019 as the U.S. economy remains strong.

120,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 12:40AM ET</span>",A tough road ahead for India's battered rupee: Reuters poll,"By Shrutee Sarkar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - There will be little respite for the bruised Indian rupee over the coming year, depressed by an escalating U.S.-China trade war and rising domestic political risks ahead of a general election, a Reuters poll showed.
Investors have generally shunned emerging market assets this year, made riskier by the international trade tensions and the increasing attractiveness of dollar yields thanks to the U.S. Federal Reserve's steady pace of rate increases.
That, and a widening current account deficit due to higher global crude oil prices and capital outflows, has pushed the rupee down almost 16 percent this year, regularly setting all-time lows. It's one of the worst performing Asian currency this year.
""The Indian rupee reflects emerging market concerns and is facing significant depreciation pressure,"" noted Tuuli McCully, head of Asia-Pacific economics at Scotiabank.
""In addition to the twin-deficit position, political uncertainty in India will remain high over the coming months due to four state elections that will be held by the end of January 2019, followed by general elections in April–May 2019; accordingly, we remain bearish on the INR over the medium-term.""
The poll of about 40 foreign exchange strategists taken Oct 26-31 showed the rupee was expected to gain slightly to 72.5 per dollar in 12 months from about 73.95 on Wednesday.
But the predicted outlook for the currency will still leave it much weaker than where it started 2018 around 63.80.
The latest consensus was only slightly better compared to the previous month, and more than one quarter of strategists with a year-ahead view predicting the currency to hit a new record low by then.
The recent life-time low for the rupee was 74.485 per dollar on October 11.
In a month, nearly one-fifth of respondents expect the currency to hit a new record low.
That is likely driven by worries about growing policy disagreements between the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government after deputy governor Viral Acharya warned that undermining the central bank's independence could be ""potentially catastrophic.""
The Economic Times newspaper reported the government had invoked never-before-used powers to issue directions to the central bank governor on matters ""of public interest,"" related to support for the financial sector and small companies.
The rupee hit 74 on the dollar on Wednesday after television channels reported RBI Governor Urjit Patel may resign due to the spat with the government.
That will put further pressure on the currency, which has lurched lower since the RBI unexpectedly left rates on hold at its Oct 5 meeting when many thought it would raise them, in part to prop up the weak currency.
""We have altered our forecasts considerably after the RBI's decision to keep its policy rates on hold in October, which, in our view, is a policy error,"" said Hugo Erken, senior economist at Rabobank.
""We hold on to our view that the INR will return to its fundamental value of approximately 68/69 against the U.S. dollar, but the trajectory towards this value will take much longer and be more painful than we initially anticipated.""

Most Asian currencies are forecast to gain against the dollar in a year, though the Chinese yuan is expected to have a bumpy ride in that period.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Chinese authorities will defend the yuan from weakening past the psychological 7 per dollar rate, very close to where it is trading now, according to a Reuters poll of FX strategists who said the currency will cut its losses in the coming year.
Interactive Reuters poll graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2RoZ7QI?eikon=true
Still, 28 of 60 strategists polled from Oct 26 to 31 forecast the partially-managed yuan to weaken to 7 to the dollar or further at some point within a year, the highest count in Reuters polls since July last year and seven more than in the October poll.
Having weakened more than 7 percent so far this year, the yuan hit its weakest since the global financial crisis on Wednesday, at 6.9748 per dollar. It's been hammered by the trade war with the United States and bets for further monetary easing by the People's Bank of China to bolster the stumbling economy.
But 20 of 37 currency strategists who answered an additional question in the latest Reuters poll said the Chinese authorities would stop the yuan from weakening to 7 per dollar or beyond.
The remaining 17 respondents said authorities would not intervene to defend that exchange rate.
""Even if we see clear signals that the Chinese central bank is against a depreciation of the renminbi, the depreciation pressure is not easing,"" wrote Zhou Hao, senior emerging market economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Singapore, in a client note.
""Nevertheless, we continue to believe that the PBoC will not abandon the psychologically significant 7 mark easily. This could trigger a capital flight that would make it all the more difficult for Chinese leaders to maintain financial stability,"" he added.
Capital outflows have increased as the yuan has approached 7 per dollar. Sales of net foreign exchanges by Chinese commercial banks rose to $17.6 billion in September, the highest since June 2017.
The onshore yuan was expected to gain around 1.8 percent to 6.85 per dollar in a year, according to the Oct 26-31 poll of 60 foreign exchange strategists. It was last trading at 6.97 per dollar on Wednesday, just about 0.4 percent away from 7 per dollar.
Those expectations are largely dependent on a weakening of the dollar's safe-haven appeal and a breakthrough in Sino-U.S. trade talks later this month.
Gao Qi, FX strategist with Scotiabank, says the yuan is not likely to cross through 7 per dollar in the run-up to the G20 summit scheduled at the end of November.
But if U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping fail to make a deal, he says it will.
""We expect the two presidents' meeting to be able to de-escalate the tensions to some extent, which would then boost risk appetite at that time and prop up (emerging market) Asian currencies,"" he added.
Trump said he thinks a deal with China will be secured, but threatened tariffs on another $267 billion worth of imports if it does not go through.
BREAKING 7?
The Chinese central bank, which has cut reserve requirements for banks four times this year, is expected to ease monetary policy further while the government has pledged more tax cuts next year to support growth.
That could exert pressure on the yuan, pushing it to 7 per dollar or beyond.
In the latest poll, the 12-month renminbi forecast was the most pessimistic median in Reuters polls since August last year.
Comparing the November and October polls, six of 35 common contributors revised their yuan forecast to reflect a stronger currency and thirteen kept projections unchanged. Sixteen revised forecasts to a weaker yuan.
That includes the weakest forecast of 7.30 per dollar, held by four banks at some point on the 12-month forecast horizon.

123,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 10:00PM ET</span>",Goldman Says Yuan Will Hit 7 as China Avoids Heavy Meddling,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s policy makers will likely allow the yuan to hit the key level of 7 per dollar within the next six months without conducting heavy intervention, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
While the authorities may guide sentiment by issuing stronger fixings, they won’t likely sell the dollar heavily to defend the currency as they did in the aftermath of a shock devaluation three years ago, according to MK Tang, a senior China economist at Goldman in Hong Kong. That is because the conditions for the yuan to hit 7 are ""more mature"" than in the past as capital outflows remain contained, he added.
""We see good economic reasons arguing for a weaker yuan, especially in the coming months,"" Tang said. ""It’s only a matter of time for the yuan to hit 7.""
The yuan has come under intense pressure to fall as China became embroiled in a trade war with the U.S. and loosened its monetary policy to bolster a slowing economy. The currency touched its weakest level in more than a decade this week, spurring debate on when and whether it could slide to 7 for the first time since the global financial crisis.
Another reason policy makers are likely to be averse to outright intervention is the yuan is more liberalized than in the past, Tang said, and such tools will only be used moderately in the future. Chinese officials have been working to make the yuan more market-driven as they seek to attract more foreign investors onshore and promote the currency’s global use.
How far the yuan can slide may depend on how much weakness the PBOC is willing to tolerate. In early 2017 when the currency was close to the current level, the authorities engineered a cash squeeze in the offshore market to punish bears. The latest sign of officials’ uneasiness came on Wednesday, when Hong Kong’s government said the Chinese central bank will issue bills in the city for the first time ever -- a move that would drain liquidity and support the yuan.

Signs of rising fund outflows are emerging as official data suggest that Chinese investors’ demand for foreign-exchange surged the most in nearly two years in September. Still, the level is only a fraction of the capital flight seen after the 2015 yuan devaluation. The government has had capital controls in place since then -- limiting banks’ cross-border transfers and making it less convenient for households in China to buy the dollar -- to stem fund exodus.
""It’s possible that outflows will pick up from September as the yuan continues to weaken,"" Tang said, adding he sees the yuan weakening to 7.1 in the next six months. ""I expect policy makers to use capital controls more proactively to manage outflows pressures.""
The onshore yuan climbed for the first time in four sessions, rising 0.14 percent to 6.9644 per dollar as of 9:51 a.m. in Shanghai. That came after the People’s Bank of China set its daily reference rate at a stronger-than-expected level on Thursday. The offshore rate erased a loss to gain 0.05 percent.

131,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",Falling Peso Hits Debt-Laden Philippine Companies,"(Bloomberg) -- The Philippines’ biggest companies face another year of significant repayments of U.S. dollar debt after record amounts came due in 2018, even as a slumping peso makes it costlier to pay back.
A total of $4.9 billion in dollar bonds and loans have matured or will still come due in 2018, more than four times the amount last year and the highest since at least 2003, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Obligations that groups such as San Miguel Corp., SM Investments Corp. and Ayala Corp. need to refinance or repay in the next five years will remain sizable.
The Philippine credit market is seeing reminders of the late 1990s Asian financial crisis, as big companies including banks, brewers and builders must pay back dollar debt at a time when the home currency is depreciating.
The peso, among Asia’s worst performers this year, will likely weaken by 2.4 percent in 2019 to 54.90 pesos per dollar and to 55 the year after, according to a Bloomberg survey. It closed at 53.590 a dollar on Oct. 30.
As currency volatility lingers, the Philippine central bank is closely monitoring corporate credit for risks it could pose to the financial system.
Huge exposure to foreign-currency debt, at a time when the peso has touched 12-year lows, could erode corporate profitability and add to banks’ overall credit risks, the central bank said in an emailed reply to questions. This is especially true for companies that haven’t sufficiently hedged their dollar obligations, it said.
Probably only 20 percent to 30 percent of private dollar debt is hedged, excluding any natural cover from dollar earnings, according to Eduardo Francisco, president of BDO Capital & Investment Corp., which is engaged in securities underwriting, loan syndication and the financial advisory business. No official numbers are reported to the central bank.
“Hedging levels have likely remained the same over the years because hedge cover has always been expensive,” Francisco said. “The market is not that deep.”
The most at risk from the peso slump are construction and transportation companies, whose revenues are in the local currency but they make large investments in dollars, according to S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings analyst Bertrand Jabouley.
San Miguel and its energy units have to pay off the most dollar debt in the next five years at $3.3 billion, based on publicly available data. The beer maker that had expanded to infrastructure enters into currency swaps to manage its long-term borrowings, according to regulatory filings.
The conglomerate and units including oil refiner Petron Corp. and SMC Global Power Holdings Corp. have been borrowing in pesos in the past three years to refinance dollar obligations. The company declined to provide details of its hedging.

While hedge cover remains costly, companies like Ayala count on their dollar earnings to provide protection. The conglomerate, whose banking, utility and telecom units face $1.5 billion in outstanding dollar debt to 2023, said in latest regulatory filings it is fully covered by its foreign currency assets.
“Despite the weakness of the peso against the dollar, Ayala did not incur materially significant debt-related foreign exchange losses” as of the third quarter, it said.
SM Investments vice chairman Teresita Sy-Coson said she doesn’t expect the peso slump to have a great impact on the company’s ability to service its debts.
“As long as we’re hedged, we’re OK. We’ve learned our lessons from the 1997 Asian financial crisis,” she said. SM, which owns the Philippines’ biggest bank and largest mall operator, has $1.9 billion in outstanding dollar debt in the next five years.

132,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>",Weakest Yuan Since 2008 Puts Spotlight on China Capital Outflows,"(Bloomberg) -- How much further will China’s currency slide after it touched the weakest level in a decade on Tuesday?
The answer may depend in large part on whether Beijing can keep capital outflows under control. Official figures released over the past few weeks suggest money is increasingly leaving China’s borders, a reminder that motivated citizens and companies still have ways to get their cash out despite a tightening of capital controls after the country’s shock devaluation in 2015.
While there’s little to suggest a stampede for the exits is imminent, the risk increases with every tick lower in the yuan. Below are some of the key indicators investors are watching to gauge whether the recent trickle of outflows will turn into a flood.
Foreign Reserves
Shrinking foreign-exchange reserves may be a sign of central bank intervention, capital outflows, or both. One important caveat: broad gains in the dollar sometimes reduce the value of other foreign currencies in China’s stockpile, leading to declines in reported reserves that aren’t a result of intervention. In September, reserves shrank the most since February to $3.09 trillion. The People’s Bank of China will release October figures on Nov. 7.
PBOC Positions for FX Purchases
This series shows the amount of overseas currencies the PBOC bought or sold against the yuan, another indicator of official intervention. When the numbers are falling, it suggests the central bank may be offloading foreign currencies. September’s figure showed the biggest decline since January 2017. The next print will come around mid-November.
Banks’ FX Settlement on Behalf of Clients
This is an indicator of individual and corporate demand for overseas currencies. When onshore banks’ net foreign-exchange settlement for clients in the spot market is negative, it suggests banks sold more foreign currencies to customers than they did the yuan. In September, net foreign-currency sales were the biggest since December 2016. October figures will be released by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Nov. 19.
Cross-Border Fund Flows Via Yuan Payments
This has been a closely watched indicator since mid-2016, when economists flagged that Chinese investors were sending money overseas in yuan rather than in foreign currencies in an effort to skirt capital controls. Chinese lenders registered the most net outflows via cross-border yuan payments since July 2017 in September. The October figure is expected on Nov. 19.
Foreign Buying of Chinese Bonds
This straightforward series, released monthly by China Central Depository & Clearing, reflects overseas investors’ net purchases or sales of onshore bonds. Foreigners have been net buyers for 19 straight months, but they increased holdings at the slowest pace in six months in September.
Household Dollar Savings
Published by the PBOC, the figure shows whether local investors have added or reduced foreign-exchange deposits at banks. An increase typically reflects stronger demand for overseas currencies. Aside from the exchange rate, investor interest in holding dollar deposits depends on relative interest rates and the availability of other investment options. Foreign-exchange deposits shrank for a third consecutive month in September.
Yuan Deposits in Hong Kong
This is a gauge of Hong Kong investors’ appetite for the yuan. An increase suggests they’re more willing to hold the Chinese currency, a decision that can be influenced by the exchange rate and interest-rate differentials. The stockpile rose for a second month in September."

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar hit a new 2 1/2-month high on Tuesday, supported by worries about an escalation of the Sino-U.S. trade war and more signs the United States economy is outperforming rivals, while weak euro zone growth knocked the single currency lower.
Data showed that the euro zone grew less than expected in the third quarter and economic confidence continued to fall, sending the euro to a day's low.
The headwinds for the euro, which include a standoff between the European Union and Rome over Italy's rules-breaking budget, come just as demand for the dollar rebounds.
""Trade wars, a recovery on equity markets and poor data out of Europe and stronger data in the U.S."" were supporting the dollar at the euro's expense, said Niels Christensen, chief analyst at Nordea.
""I don't think the euro will bounce back. There's no reason for the ECB (European Central Bank) to start sounding more hawkish unless inflation surprises,"" he said.
Investors bought into the dollar after Bloomberg reported that Washington was preparing to announce tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports by early December if talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping fail to ease the trade war.
YUAN AT DECADE LOW
With concerns about an escalating trade war and a Chinese economic slowdown mounting, the yuan hit a 22-month low in offshore markets . The onshore currency  slid to its weakest in 10 years.
The yuan has been one of the biggest casualties as the dollar steamrolled higher in 2018. 
The dollar, measured against a basket of its peers, rose 0.3 percent to 96.926 (DXY), its strongest since Aug. 15.
Friday's stronger-than-expected GDP numbers in the United States and a tentative recovery on Wall Street this week have again underlined that the U.S. economy is outperforming. 
The euro dropped 0.2 percent to $1.1345 (EUR=), after reaching a 10-week low of $1.1336 on Friday. On Monday, the single currency fell on news German Chancellor Angela Merkel would not be seeking re-election as head of the Christian Democrats party.
""This [The euro's weakness] is due to Italian-budget-related political tension and fears over the future of the German political landscape, which threaten the single currency with further downside,"" said Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at online broker ActivTrades. 
The Japanese yen extended its recent losses against the dollar, partly because Japanese investors have been net buyers of offshore equities this month. 
The yen fell 0.4 percent to 112.845 , as traders prepared for the Bank of Japan monetary policy meeting due Wednesday.
In a sign that overall demand for risk was improving despite the trade war fears, the Australian dollar  gained half a percent to $0.7093 on Tuesday. 

The Aussie is often viewed as a barometer of broader risk sentiment, as well as a proxy for China-related risks since China is the largest buyer of Australia's key exports.

137,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 05:50AM ET</span>",Investors hedge their faith in China's faltering yuan,"By Noah Sin and Winni Zhou
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - As China's yuan approaches the 7 to the dollar barrier, investors are betting authorities will eventually let the currency fall beyond the historic level. Yet they are just as confident that China won't allow the kind of capitulation seen in past market meltdowns.
The Chinese currency <CNY=CFXS> has fallen 10 percent against the dollar since March, when the first set of tit-for-tat tariffs in the U.S.-Sino trade war were announced, and has been inching close to the psychologically significant 7 figure, a decade low.
Although the central bank has not directly intervened to stem this decline against a strengthening dollar, it has signaled it won't allow excessive volatility. Policy insiders have told Reuters authorities will fight a rapid descent in the yuan.
Data from currency reserves and commercial bank operations, however, suggest capital outflows are rising, possibly as investors bet on a yuan decline.
""It is natural that people in China want to hedge themselves,"" said Cliff Tan, East Asia head of global markets research at MUFG, in Hong Kong.
""This is a sign that capital outflow is increasing, but it is not a sign of capital flight. They may have to tighten capital controls further eventually.""
Few expect a replay of the 2015-2016 sell-off that caused China's stock markets to plunge and the yuan to fall 11 percent over 17 months. The stringent capital controls enacted then are still in force, companies have less foreign debt and China still has $3 trillion of currency reserves, should it need to defend the yuan.
Still, the backdrop of a trade war that has caused mainland stocks to lose a quarter of their value this year, rising U.S. yields and monetary easing at home mean investors aren't putting blind faith in the yuan's stability.
Commercial banks in China have pumped $28.1 billion into markets so far this year, a contrast from 2017 when they mopped up dollars. These banks sold a net $17.6 billion of foreign exchange to retail clients in September, the most in 15 months.
""The data represents the view that many locals, including importers, think the yuan will be weaker as the dollar strengthens further,"" said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING Wholesale Banking.
Eric Stein, Boston-based co-director of the global income group at Eaton Vance Management, who manages approximately $20 billion, said his team has been running short positions in the yuan for the past five months or so.
""What China has right now is a policy preference for modestly weaker but not significantly weaker currency. That would probably be an impetus for increasing the short position,"" he said.
GRAPHIC: China's falling yuan approaches 7/dollar - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Oqh8Ru
TAKING NO CHANCES
The short-yuan trade has worked as an effective hedge in recent months for the M&G (Lux) Dynamic Allocation strategy, said Graziano Creperio, a London-based investment specialist with the firm.
About 6 percent of the $10.5 billion fund's net asset value is in the short yuan trade, protecting the fund's 2 percent long position in Chinese equities.
""We’re very positive on equities...if we’re wrong about being too bullish about it, then we would expect this currency to depreciate,"" Creperio said. ""We’re hedging, in a small fashion, but at least it created a little bit of buffer and protection.""
In the options and forward markets, bets that the yuan will hit 7 soon have been rising, despite China pushing up funding costs to make it more expensive for speculators to short-sell the currency.
Yet, the flows so far have been small. China has spent only about $53 billion of its reserves this year, a fraction of the trillion dollars it burned in 2015 and 2016.
""From our conversations with corporates, we're not sensing panic,"" said Lu Sun, a China currency strategist at Citi. ""There are outflows via banks, but it's about $10 billion per month in recent months, compared with about $100 billion in late 2015.""
And the PBOC hasn't minced its words for the bears.
""For those who are trying to short the renminbi, we are very familiar with each other as we fought hand to hand a few years ago,"" Pan Gongsheng, deputy central bank governor, said on Friday. ""I think it's still fresh in our memory.""

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.13% to 96.47 by 04:49 AM ET (08:49 AM GMT), within striking distance of the 10-week high of 96.62 set on Friday.
Demand for the dollar continued to be underpinned after Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration is preparing to announce tariffs on all Chinese imports by early December if talks next month fail to ease the trade conflict between Washington and Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are due to meet in Argentina during the G20 Summit late next month.
The escalation in trade tensions comes against a background concerns over a weakening earnings outlook for technology companies and the pace of U.S. interest rate increases.
The yen, typically seen as a safe haven during time of market turmoil, was lower against the dollar, with USD/JPY advancing 0.4% to 112.82 ahead of the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy announcement on Wednesday.
The euro was little changed against the dollar, with EUR/USD at 1.1366, not far from Friday’s 10-week lows of 1.1335.
The single currency has been pressured lower by rising political risk in the euro area.

The yuan moved closer to the key level of 7.0000 per dollar as the USD/CNY pair inched up 0.2% to 6.9699 by 11:30 PM ET (03:30 GMT).
The fall in the Chinese currency came after Bloomberg reported that the U.S. is preparing to impose tariffs on the remaining $257 billion of Chinese imports if talks in November between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping do not go well.
The two leaders are due to meet during the Group of 20 leaders summit in Argentina at the end of November.
The yuan was under pressure in recent months and plunged 9% since April after the People’s Bank of China cut its reserve-ratio requirement for the fourth time this year.
Despite recent weakness in the yuan, Chinese media said this week that the Chinese currency is unlikely to weaken beyond 7.0000 against the dollar.
The PBOC set its official Yuan midpoint to the lowest level in over a decade on Tuesday. The Yuan reference rate was fixed at 6.9574 per dollar, 0.3% weaker than the previous fix of 6.9377.
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was up 0.3% to 96.44. The greenback was supported by safe-haven demand amid rising trade tensions between China and the U.S.

140,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 06:11PM ET</span>",China Aims to Pull More Currency Trading to Its Domestic Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- China plans to deepen its foreign-exchange markets to encourage both domestic and overseas players to trade and borrow external currencies more onshore, in the latest step toward fostering a global role for its financial system.
The China Foreign Exchange Trade System, an arm of the central bank, plans to develop swaps involving overseas currencies -- such as between the euro and the dollar -- and foreign-exchange interest-rate swaps, among other steps detailed in emailed responses to questions posed by Bloomberg. CFETS also aims to build reference rates in onshore markets for dollar borrowing across the maturity spectrum. That could encourage companies to seek dollar funding at home rather than overseas, tapping the pool of U.S. currency held in China.
While China has kept tight controls on outflows of capital, it has steadily opened its domestic markets to overseas investors, including the use of yuan-denominated oil futures, which were introduced in Shanghai earlier this year. In currency trading, Tokyo and Singapore have long dominated volumes in the Asian time zone, even as China grew to become the region’s top economy and the world’s biggest trading nation.
“Developing the foreign-currency market onshore will facilitate cross-border capital flows, and put China one step closer to a complete opening-up of the capital account,” said MK Tang, a senior China economist at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). in Hong Kong. The moves could make it easier for Chinese companies to borrow in foreign currencies, and foster the internationalization of the yuan, he said.
Foreign-currency borrowing stood at $36 billion, measured by daily average transaction volume, for the first nine months of this year -- up 47 percent from the same period last year, CFETS said. Domestic Chinese institutions have amassed hundreds of billions of dollars worth of foreign exchange, care of deposits by companies and households and the issuance of foreign-currency bonds.
While China effectively slowed its campaign to internationalize the yuan in the wake of a devaluation in 2015 that spooked global investors, it has deepened links to overseas markets more recently. One such step came last year with the Bond Connect, which lets foreign traders buy Chinese fixed income via Hong Kong -- mirroring the two stock-trading links that have been set up with the city since 2014.
The latest plans come even after the yuan tumbled about 9 percent against the dollar over the past six months. The plans for benchmark borrowing costs in dollars follow China’s second issuance of sovereign bonds in the U.S. currency in a year, in face of a worsening trade war with the U.S.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.25% to 96.37.
Bloomberg News reported that the U.S. is planning on implementing additional tariffs on more Chinese products if upcoming talks between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping falter.
The U.S. has slapped tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, about half the value of U.S. imports from the country. China has retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion worth of American exports.
The news sparked a selloff of risk assets as Wall Street gave up gains, but demand for the safe-haven yen was subdued as the dollar held most of its gains.
USD/JPY rose 0.46% to Y112.40.
The dollar was helped by data showing the U.S. consumer spending rose for a seventh straight month in September, reaffirming expectations that a strong consumer would continue to prop up economic growth.
Weakness in both the pound and euro, meanwhile, also helped the greenback tack on gains.
GBP/USD fell 0.19% to $1.2806 after U.K. Treasury chief Philip Hammond gave an upbeat assessment of the UK economy, forecasting the budget deficit to fall to £19.8 billion ($25.34 billion), and touting higher projections for growth and tax receipts over the next couple of years.

LONDON (Reuters) - German bond yields rose on Monday after Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would not seek re-election as party chairwoman and that her fourth term as chancellor would be her last, while Italian yields fell on relief at an unchanged ratings verdict from S&P.
Merkel has been chairwoman of her conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) since 2000 and chancellor since 2005. Her decision to step down as chairwoman comes after her party suffered its second regional election setback in as many weeks.
The move also sets in motion the process for the CDU to settle on, and groom, Merkel's successor.
While German bonds, regarded as one of the safest assets in the world, often benefit from uncertainty, the implications of latest political developments left even German bond investors slightly rattled while the euro (EUR=) weakened.
""This news would signal the quality of German credit would deteriorate because markets are extrapolating from the results of the weekend state election to conclude that the next government will have a bigger populist portion to it,"" said Mizuho rates strategist Peter Chatwell.
""So that explains the rise in German yields but there is also a need to treat German bonds as a risk-free (investment), so if there was a lot of stress a selloff would be limited.""
Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield rose three basis points to 0.38 percent (DE10YT=RR), above seven-week lows hit last week at around 0.34 percent.
Across the German curve, yields were up 2-5 bps on the day.

The risk of the German coalition collapsing before the next election had risen, analysts said.
""Perhaps the biggest implications are for the euro zone as a whole,"" said Jennifer McKeown, chief European economist at Capital Economics. ""Given her (Merkel's) weakened position, an agreement over Italy's budget may take longer to reach, increasing the threat of contagion to other markets and adding to the risks to Italian banks.""
S&P LIFT
For now, Italian bonds took their steer from news on Friday that ratings agency Standard & Poor's had decided to leave Italy's rating unchanged at BBB, two notches above junk.
S&P lowered the ratings outlook to negative from stable, saying that the new government's policy plans were weighing on the country's growth and debt prospects.
But the decision to leave the rating unchanged, a week after Moody's downgraded its Italy rating, bought some relief.
Italy's 10-year bond yield fell to its lowest in almost a month at 3.29 percent (IT10YT=RR), before settling at around 3.32 percent by the close. 
The gap over top-rated German bond yields narrowed to 294 bps from around 306 bps late Friday (DE10IT10=RR).
""The underlying budget concern is an ongoing issue but the ratings risks are out of the way for the rest of the year as there are no more scheduled ratings decisions,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) rates strategist Rainer Guntermann.

143,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>","As stocks suffer, forex markets keep calm and carry on","By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - As global stock markets head for one of their worst months in a decade and bond market volatility surges to more than four-month highs, the stampede out of risk has left the foreign exchange market largely unmoved.
Riskier currencies - from emerging markets or linked to commodity prices - have not suffered the sharp selloffs that would normally be expected when panicked investors rush for safety.
Similarly, in contrast to this year's ""vol-mageddon"" meltdown, the safe-haven yen <JPY=> hasn't caught as much of a bid as many expected. It's up 1.2 percent this month compared to a 2.3 percent surge in February.
This relatively benign reaction may be because, unlike in equities where signs of a peak in corporate earnings growth has sparked fears for the fate of a decade-long bull-market, currencies had already started adjusting to a world of slowing growth.
More importantly, it might also suggest that while investors need to adjust to a world of slower growth and tighter financial conditions as the U.S. Federal Reserve raises interest rates, they need not panic because there is no real evidence yet of a deeper downturn, analysts say.
Currency volatility, while rising, is no higher than it was in August and remains far below average levels between 2015 and 2017.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s currency volatility Index has increased to 7.99 from 7.66 on Oct. 1 .
Volatility on Wall Street (VIX) has jumped by far more, more than doubling since the start of October to within a whisker of eight-month highs.
U.S. bond price swings have leapt almost 50 percent, according to one measure (MERMOVE1M), and are at 4-1/2 month highs.
GRAPHIC: FX volatility - https://tmsnrt.rs/2OYmOlY
Stephen Gallo, BMO'S European currency strategy head, said one of the reasons for the relative calm in currencies was because investors were already so loaded up on the dollar.
They had slashed their holdings of riskier currencies in emerging markets during the August slide sparked by a meltdown in the Turkish lira.
""Positioning is already long dollars. We have already seen waves of EM FX selling,"" he said.
Even so the dollar, while inching toward a 2-1/2-month high versus its peers (DXY), is up a modest 1.5 percent in October.
GRAPHIC: Emerging market currencies - https://tmsnrt.rs/2OUax1W
The relative calm in currency markets may also reflect the view that the equity slide has been triggered primarily by a reassessment of U.S. growth expectations rather than something broader.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts note that the currencies of countries with high exposure to U.S. demand - Canada <CAD=>, Colombia <COP=>, Israel <ILS=> and Mexico <MXN=> - have suffered heavily in October.
In contrast, currencies typically vulnerable to a downturn in sentiment like the Australian dollar <AUD=>, Indian rupee <INR=> or South African rand <ZAR=>, have held up relatively well.
""In other words, for FX, this equity drawdown has been more U.S. demand-centric than normal,"" they wrote.
""Typical safe havens such as yen and Swiss franc have also had a more muted response over the past month than predicted by historical sensitivities to the S&P Index.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher against the euro, on Monday, close to a 10-week high hit last week, on news German Chancellor Angela Merkel would not seek re-election as head of her CDU party.
More broadly, the dollar added to recent gains against other major currencies, supported by robust U.S. consumer spending data on Monday.
Merkel said she would not seek re-election as party chairwoman, heralding the end of a 13-year era in which she has dominated European politics.
""Currency markets considered her the Iron Lady of Europe,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto.
""This is certainly not positive for the euro's political backing,"" he said.
Merkel's weakness at home may limit her capacity to lead in the European Union at a time when the bloc is dealing with Brexit and a budget crisis in Italy, said Schamotta.
Merkel has loomed large on the European stage since 2005, helping guide the EU through the euro zone crisis and opening Germany's doors to migrants fleeing war in the Middle East in 2015 - a move that still divides the bloc and Germany. 
""Merkel has been a stabilizing force for the euro zone throughout the last decade,"" Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at online forex broker Oanda, said in a note.
The euro was 0.28 percent lower against the greenback.

The dollar has been boosted by growing volatility in capital markets spurred by concerns about corporate earnings and geopolitical uncertainty.
Data showed U.S. consumer spending rose for a seventh straight month in September.

Broad dollar strength, as concerns swirl over risks of a global economic slowdown, was the main influence in the currency market, and there are growing expectations that the yuan could breach 7 per dollar in coming months, a level last seen during the global financial crisis. During intra-day trade on Friday the yuan had struck a 22-month low of 6.9647, before rallying on verbal support from a senior central banker.
""For currency flexibility, it's not absolutely unacceptable for the RMB to go beyond 7, especially when the dollar strengthens like now,"" Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie in Hong Kong, said in a note.
""If the market views the depreciation as a passive one, mainly driven by a strong dollar, such a depreciation might not destabilize expectations too much.""
He expected the central bank's reaction to be guided by trends in capital outflows.
Policy insiders told Reuters on Friday that China is likely to use its vast currency reserves to stop any precipitous fall through the psychologically important 7 level as it could risk triggering speculation and heavy capital outflows.
Prior to the spot market's open, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC> at 6.9377 per dollar, 133 pips or 0.2 percent firmer than the previous fix of 6.951 on Friday.
However, major state-owned banks, which usually act on behalf of the central bank to prop up the Chinese yuan, did not appear to be selling dollars on Monday, some traders said.
""The central bank is likely to keep the yuan at firmer than 7 level before the midterm election in the United States (on Nov. 6) but it will continue to test market's reaction to further depreciation in the yuan,"" said Ken Cheung, senior Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong.
Last week, the yuan weakened 0.23 percent against the dollar, but on a trade-weighted basis , it rose 0.18 percent against a basket of its trading partners' currencies, according to official data from the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS).
The index, published on a weekly and monthly basis, stood at 92.32 on Friday, CFETS said on its website.

148,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 01:30AM ET</span>",Rupee Slump to Push India to Seek Yuan Trade Settlement,"(Bloomberg) -- India is considering allowing some imports from China to be settled in yuan, people familiar with the proposal said, as the South Asian nation moves to limit its currency’s loss against the dollar.
The plan would enable direct convertibility between the rupee and yuan and will help cut transaction and hedging costs, the people said, asking not to be identified citing rules. The proposal would allow Indian exports of pharmaceuticals, oilseeds and sugar to China to be settled in rupee, while keeping out trade in high volume products such as electronics, they said.
India-China trade is mainly settled in U.S. dollars since currencies between the two nations aren’t directly convertible. By allowing Indian importers to pay for Chinese goods in yuan, the South Asian nation would be able to save on dollars to pay for escalating oil import costs in the face of higher crude prices and the rupee’s slump to a record low.
Oil is India’s biggest import item and the government estimates it will pay a record $125 billion, or 8.8 trillion rupees, for crude imports this fiscal year, the highest in rupee terms since 2001.
Currency Risks
A small but viable and ring-fenced basket of commodities is being considered for rupee-yuan trade, according to the person. Allowing direct convertibility can help cut currency risks for Indian traders, the person said.
India’s Commerce ministry spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to two phone calls to her mobile phone. China’s Ministry of Commerce and the central bank didn’t immediately respond to separates faxes seeking comments.
Limiting the basket to a few items will help Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government keep India’s $56 billion trade deficit with China in check. The current-account deficit is already at the highest level in five years, with the government raising tariffs on imports of items ranging from air-conditioners to communication gear in a bid to curb the shortfall and stabilize the rupee.
For China, the move would help broaden the yuan’s influence and improve liquidity overseas. The option of invoicing half of trade between the so-called BRICS nations -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- in yuan had already been discussed by the group.
Bank of China Ltd. started a yuan clearing and settlement service in Pakistan in May, and similar yuan hubs have been set up in Russia and Canada to allow traders to settle transactions. A similar system could be considered in India, the people said.
Earlier discussions about trading in local currencies had made little progress with Indian banks expressing apprehension about U.S. regulations and with 80 percent of the nation’s trade valued in dollars.
China has been seeking to expand bilateral trade with India amid an intensifying trade conflict with the U.S. However, Indian policy makers are worried manufacturers may not be able to cope if Chinese imports rise dramatically with the currency plan, the people said.

On those days, the yen has shown a tendency to strengthen during U.S. trading hours, as stock market volatility sparks a flurry of haven bets, before weakening again in the Asian session as domestic flows take precedence and the bullish traders back off.
“Global financial markets are starting to rotate around U.S. equities as rising U.S. yields are having an impact, weighing on the dollar-yen,” said Naohiro Nomoto, manager of FX trading at MUFG Bank in Tokyo. “But when trading shifts to Asia, dollar-yen short positions tend to be squeezed.”
Traders anticipating Japanese stocks will follow U.S. peers lower at the Asian open may short the dollar-yen currency pair, only to cover positions if moves are muted, Nomoto said. Then, buying from real money such as Japanese importers sets in temporarily to underpin the pair. Positions are unwound toward the U.S. trading session and the dollar-yen starts to edge down again, he said.
Some market participants may also be using the Cboe Volatility Index, a gauge of equity volatility, as a trigger to place and unwind positions, said Shuntaro Ikeshima, chief manager for FX and financial products trading at Mitsubishi UFJ Trust & Banking in Tokyo.
The Japanese currency has been a haven during the recent sell-off in U.S equities -- the dollar-yen is down 1.6 percent since Oct. 2 with the S&P Index down about 9 percent. The pair declined 0.6 percent during the February correction when the American benchmark dropped over 10 percent.
Still, there doesn’t seem to be an imbalance overall in positions favoring either the dollar or the yen, keeping both more or less neutral, according to MUFG Bank’s Nomoto. While leveraged funds continue to hold a net short position on the Japanese currency, they have been cutting bearish bets over the last two weeks, according to the latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.

153,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 07:53AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Guarding stability, China likely to slow yuan's slide to 7 per dollar - sources","By Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China is likely to use its vast currency reserves to stop any precipitous fall through the psychologically important level of 7 yuan per dollar as it could risk triggering speculation and heavy capital outflows, policy insiders said.
On Friday, the yuan  yuan hit a fresh 22-month low of 6.9647 against the dollar, and traders expected that the tightly managed, partially convertible currency would soon be testing 7 per dollar, a level unseen since the global financial crisis a decade ago.
The yuan has lost over 6 percent versus the dollar so far this year, partly reflecting its slowing economy and pressure on exports due to an ongoing tariff war with the United States. 
Two sources involved in internal policy discussions, but who are not the final decision-makers, said that a defense of the yuan at 7 per dollar would be mounted to show investors that the authorities wouldn't allow a runaway market.
""If the yuan falls through 7, there could be a rapid depreciation of the exchange rate"", said one policy insider. ""In order to avoid such a passive situation, the authorities are likely to step in the market to stabilize the yuan.""
The second source was certain the central bank would make a stand, rather than allow any sudden break through a psychologically important level to feed pessimism among investors.
""The central bank will intervene - intervene directly or indirectly. It's necessary. The central bank has many policy tools. We cannot let the yuan fall past 7, as it would have a psychological impact on people,"" the second source said.
Beijing's priority now is to ward off a sharper slowdown in the economy, which grew 6.5 percent in the third-quarter, the weakest pace since the global financial crisis, several sources said.
The central bank, which has cut reserve requirements for lenders four times this year, is expected to ease monetary policy further, while on the fiscal side the government has pledged more tax cuts next year to support growth. 
The People's Bank of China will probably loosen monetary policy further and let the yuan lose more ground to bolster sagging economic growth, but policymakers will be on guard against spooking markets as the exchange rate nears 7 per dollar, a third source said. 
""We need to loosen monetary policy and should allow the yuan to depreciate to help expand exports, otherwise it will be more difficult,"" the source said.
""But they (the authorities) will pay special attention to the psychological effect of breaking the 7 per dollar level.""
The PBOC did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment, but Vice Governor Pan Gongsheng told a briefing earlier that healthy economic fundamentals and ample foreign currency reserves would help keep the yuan basically stable.
Currency market participants are closely watching to see if China's foreign currency reserves fall below $3 trillion, having slipped to $3.087 trillion last month.
Reserves fell $52.9 billion in the first nine months of 2018 - with 43 percent of the drawdown happening in September, but the scale of the decline is dwarfed by a record annual drop of $512.7 billion in 2015, showing the authorities have been far less interventionist.
Pan said the central bank would adopt macro-prudential measures to stabilize market expectations, warning against speculators who seek to drive the yuan weaker. Earlier this month, authorities restricted outward investment by its residents earlier this month.
Capital outflows have picked up as the yuan moves closer to the key 7 per dollar level. Net foreign exchanges sales by China's commercial banks rose to $17.6 billion in September, the highest in 15 months.
So far this year, Chinese policymakers have been less interventionist on the yuan than they were in 2015, as a weaker currency helps cushion a slowing economy and take some of the sting out of higher U.S. tariffs, although Beijing has rejected talk that it's deliberately pushing down the yuan to spur exports.

Pan reiterated that the PBOC rejected the use of competitive currency devaluation as an answer to the trade pressures arising from the tariff war.(This version of the story was refiled to add dropped word in 1st paragraph)

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar hovered near a 10-week high on Friday as investors waited to see if U.S. economic growth figures do anything to interrupt its months of strength.
Donald Trump has expressed displeasure over the dollar's strength, defying a custom that U.S. presidents avoid openly interfering in financial markets.
Traders expect a potentially strong reading of U.S. gross domestic product data on Friday which could see the dollar climb further.
""Today's robust U.S. GDP will illustrate to the market the deep division between the U.S. and the euro zone when it comes to growth performance,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Thu Lan Nguyen.
Speculation that U.S. interest rates will be hiked more aggressively than anticipated next year would see the dollar strengthen against the euro, she added.
If the reading is lower than expectations, however, investors could worry about economic growth momentum hastening a change in the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening path.
""This number could give signs if we are close to peak earnings for U.S. corporates. Housing data and consumer goods durables data has been soft lately,"" said Sim Moh Siong, currency strategist at Bank of Singapore.
The U.S. economy is expected to have grown at a 3.3 percent annualized rate in the third quarter, following 4.2 percent in the second quarter. The Fed is expected to raise rates by 25 basis points in December.
The euro, meanwhile, (EUR=EBS) traded marginally higher at $1.1383 on Friday. It hit a two-month low of $1.1353 the previous session, following European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's failure to convince traders the ECB could pursue monetary tightening after next summer as political and economic uncertainties grow in the monetary union.
The policy guidance has been consistent since June, even though the economic outlook has darkened as political turmoil about Italy looms over the currency bloc.
Analysts said markets remain skeptical about the ECB rates given inflation remains tepid.
Elsewhere, a rebound of U.S. stocks on Thursday following the previous session's big sell-off was not sustained into the Asian day, which lent support to safe haven currencies.
The U.S. dollar lost 0.2 percent to be 112.14 versus the Japanese yen , a safe haven currency, while the Australian dollar , often viewed as a gauge of risk appetite, hit a near 33-month low.
The dollar index (DXY) traded flat at 96.56 on Friday, after hitting a two-month high on Thursday. The gains in the dollar index were largely due to the losses in the euro, which has a 57.6 percent weighting in the index.
The dollar has been supported by positive sentiment on Wall Street recently as blue-chip names such as Microsoft (O:MSFT) delivered strong earnings.
Analysts see many persisting risks for markets, including trade tensions, Italy's budget woes, geopolitical uncertainties and concerns about U.S. corporate earnings.
""Is there a slowdown coming at the moment? That's the question, and the combination of all these factors is dragging down sentiment,"" said Miraji Othman, credit strategist at BayernLB.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan and China on Friday signed a currency swap arrangement of up to $30 billion - the largest such bilateral deal concluded by Tokyo - to strengthen financial stability and spur business activity in both countries, the Bank of Japan said.
The arrangement, which takes effect on Friday and lasts until Oct. 25, 2021, will allow the exchange of local currencies between the two central banks for up to 200 billion yuan or 3.4 trillion yen ($30 billion), the BOJ said.
Earlier in the day, China and Japan signed a broad range of agreements on strengthening bilateral ties, pledging to step up cooperation in areas from finance and trade to innovation and securities listings.
The agreements were signed during Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit to Beijing for the first formal Sino-Japanese summit in seven years, as Asia's two biggest economies looked to further build relations and trust against a backdrop of trade friction with the United States.
""With the strengthening of economic and financial linkages between Japan and China, Japanese financial institutions have been expanding their renminbi-based businesses,"" the BOJ said in a statement.
The BOJ would be prepared to provide liquidity in the yuan currency, should Japanese financial institutions face unexpected difficulties in yuan settlements, and if the bank judges the liquidity provision to be necessary for ensuring the stability of Japan's financial system, it added.
The previous arrangement expired in September 2013 amid a low point in Sino-Japanese ties. Relations had soured in recent years due to territorial disputes and tensions over Japan's wartime history.
The swap was originally launched in March 2002 as part of multilateral currency swap lines known as the Chiang Mai Initiative, which was established in response to the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s.
While the previous arrangement was designed to respond to current account crisis and stabilize currency markets in Asia, the new swap deal is aimed at supporting economic and financial activities in each country by enhancing financial stability.

The BOJ also signed a separate memorandum of understanding with the People's Bank of China, with the aim of exchanging information on the offshore yuan market. The MOU was agreed upon in conjunction with the establishment of a yuan clearing bank in Japan.

Investors are watching for signs whether a much-anticipated challenge to U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May will actually materialize, and the outcome of a meeting of Conservative Party backbenchers Wednesday could be crucial. Long-time sterling bull Nomura International Plc switched to a neutral stance Monday, recommending a flat position amid reports of mounting opposition to May from within her own party.
While sterling gained Tuesday on optimism the European Union is preparing to offer a solution for the Irish border issue, political risk could yet set the currency back, according to  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA and Nomura. The prospect of a leadership threat has reappeared on traders’ radar since the weekend press reported that the number of lawmakers rallying against May was approaching the number required to officially mount a challenge.
“Any indication that political risks are on the rise in Westminster could fuel fears about a ‘no-deal’ Brexit and sink the pound,” said Valentin Marinov, head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at Credit Agricole. “While we still hope for a last-minute Brexit deal, we maintain a rather cautious stance on the pound for now.”

The country’s foreign-exchange reserves plunged $5.14 billion in the week ended Oct. 12, the biggest drop in seven years, hinting the central bank intervened to stem the rupee’s losses from getting out of hand after it held interest rates at an Oct. 5 meeting.
While it may be too early to conclude that the RBI will step in frequently to defend the rupee on such a magnitude regularly, the intervention along with a fall in oil prices helped steady the currency, according to analysts at Natwest Markets Plc and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc.
“This reserve selling was mostly due to USD/INR buying pressure after the FX market reacted negatively to the RBI decision,” said Maximillian Lin, an emerging-markets Asia strategist at NatWest in Singapore. The intervention helped limit further weakness in the rupee, a move helped by a decline in oil prices and a softer dollar, he said.
The rupee lost more than one percent in three sessions after the RBI’s rate decision, sinking to a record 74.4825 on Oct. 11. Asia’s worst-performing currency then recovered to advance over the past two weeks, though ING Bank NV has said the bounce will soon give way to another round of declines.
“The strong intervention appears to be aimed at containing the losses post the RBI policy, and they may also have been worried about this spilling into the equity market,” said Gopikrishnan MS, head of foreign exchange, rates and credit for South Asia at Standard Chartered in Mumbai.
The rupee on Wednesday rose, reflecting gains in other emerging-market Asian currencies, gaining 0.4 percent to 73.28 as of 9:13 a.m. in Mumbai, halting two days of declines.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The safe-haven Japanese yen and the Swiss franc held firm against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday as risk-averse investors trimmed their exposure to the greenback in the face of a weak performance on Wall Street.
Worries about U.S. corporate earnings knocked the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) and the S&P 500 (SPX) on Tuesday, though they had pared losses by the closing bell.
While the dollar is also considered a safe haven currency, weakness in U.S. equities has tended to undercut its appeal especially as talk of a peak in U.S. corporate earnings has raised concerns about the outlook for economic growth.
Any signs of strain in U.S. growth has implications for Federal Reserve policy, with a steady pace of U.S. rate increases providing a boost to the dollar this year.
""We have maintained that when sentiment really turns nasty that the yen will remain the market’s safe haven of choice,"" said Rabobank analysts in a research note.
The Japanese yen <JPY=> was steady at 112.43 in early Asian trade, having gained 0.32 percent on Tuesday and was the best performing currency in the G-10 space in that session.
The U.S. dollar index, a gauge of its value against six major peers, was wobbly in early Asia trade. It was last slightly lower at 95.94.
The Swiss franc <CHF=>, considered another safe haven, traded flat at 0.9952 on the dollar, after advancing over the last two sessions.
The euro (EUR=) was also steady at $1.1472, although bearish sentiment against the common currency amid Italy's budget woes has limited any chance of a rally.
On Tuesday, the European Commission rejected Italy's draft 2019 budget, saying it brazenly broke EU rules on public spending, and asked Rome to submit a new one within three weeks or face disciplinary action.
The uncertainty around Italy's free spending budget has also bred some doubt on whether the European Central Bank (ECB) would be able to raise interest rates next summer.
""Euro will move cautiously for the next 3 weeks as it looks like Italy doesn't want to give ground,"" said Rodrigo Catril, senior currency strategist at NAB.
""However, in the near term we don't think Italy's woes will affect ECB's policy...ECB will try to paint a picture of confidence in the short term,"" Catril said.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has agreed to give Pakistan $3 billion in foreign currency support for a year and a further loan worth up to $3 billion in deferred payments for oil imports to help stave off a current account crisis, Pakistan's government said on Tuesday.
The $6 billion total exceeds forecasts by analysts and will likely reduce the size of any bailout Pakistan it receives from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), with whom it is currently engaged in talks on a rescue package. 
The Saudi agreement came as new Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan attended a Saudi investment conference that has been boycotted by several other leaders over the death of a dissident Saudi writer at the country's consulate in Istanbul.
Khan had said before departing that his country is ""desperate"" to shore up its foreign currency reserves, which are at a four-year low, equivalent to less than two months' imports and barely enough to make its debt repayments through the rest of the year. 
Finance Minister Asad Umar this month requested talks with the IMF for the country's second bailout in five years. An IMF team is due to visit Pakistan to open negotiations on Nov. 7.
Khan had however sought to avoid going to the IMF and still wants to at least reduce the size of any bailout by appealing to ""friendly countries"" for bilateral financial support.
Khan had visited Saudi Arabia last month in his first overseas trip since taking office in August, but that trip failed to produce any significant assistance, despite Pakistani media reports of agreements on deferred oil payments.
Pakistan's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday night said the latest visit had met with success.
""It was agreed Saudi Arabia will place a deposit of $3 billion for a period of one year as balance of payment support,"" the ministry said in a statement.
""It was also agreed that a one year deferred payment facility for import of oil, up to $3 billion, will be provided by Saudi Arabia. This arrangement will be in place for three years, which will be reviewed thereafter.""
Khan is scheduled to visit China next week.
Pakistani officials have been concerned the United States, which has fallen out with Islamabad, will push the IMF to impose harsh conditions on Pakistan as part of any bailout. 

Pakistani analysts say reducing the size of the bailout package needed from the IMF would shore up Pakistan's weak position during negotiations with the fund.

174,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>","Yen, Swiss franc to regain allure if global market storm hits","By Tommy Wilkes and Tom Finn
LONDON (Reuters) - Shaky global stocks and a recent spike in U.S. equity volatility have sounded a warning for investors eager to find assets offering shelter in case world markets go belly-up.
Treasury bonds, gold, London property, and even bitcoin have lured investors during times of stress. In currency markets, the dollar, Swiss franc and Japanese yen are the traditional go-to choices.
But the conundrum of recent months is that few of these assets have lived up to their reputation for safety. Even as trade war fears, U.S. equity volatility and Italy's public spending plans have rattled investors, the yen  has lost 7 percent to the dollar since March. 
The Swiss franc (EURCHF=) has gained two percent against the euro in 2018 but fallen since early September, despite an Italy-European Union showdown over Rome's budget spending.
German and U.S. government bonds, having enjoyed a decade-long bull market run, are widely seen as expensive; gold , often considered inflation-proof, is down five percent this year.
Only the dollar has reigned supreme, benefiting from being the world's most liquid currency, the robust U.S. economy and rising interest rates.
OLD FAVORITES
For all that, many think a major equity setback after such a long upward swing or a serious growth slump, especially in the United States, will leave the old favorites as the only reasonable hedges. 
Both the yen and the franc will appreciate as all else tanks, investors predict.
""You would expect that to happen if the U.S. stock market came down 10 percent or European banks by the same, if there was a serious risk-off event,"" said Jim Leaviss, head of the retail fixed-income business at M&G Investments, which runs 351 billion pounds ($464 billion) in assets.
This month has offered some signs the yen will function as expected if market volatility spikes and investors dump stocks. 
On Oct. 10, when U.S. shares plunged in their biggest one-day loss since February, the yen strengthened. On Tuesday, it again flexed its muscles, rising half a percent following sharp Wall Street losses the previous day.
(Graphic: Volatility spikes boost yen - https://tmsnrt.rs/2J0plpB)
Kaspar Hense, portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management, said he had bought the yen in recent days as a cheap way to hedge against a stock market correction. 
""Japanese money will reverse its flow to international markets, that should strengthen the yen,"" he said.
MONEY HEADS HOME
Therein lies the appeal of the yen and franc. Boasting vast current account surpluses, both Switzerland and Japan have hefty assets overseas. When world markets fall, Japanese and Swiss investors tend to bring cash home, boosting their currencies.
Switzerland's surplus is worth nearly 10 percent of its economy while Japan's -- at roughly $184 billion last year -- represents four percent of GDP.
In contrast, the U.S. current account deficit is two percent while Britain runs a deficit of almost four percent of GDP.
(Graphic: G20 current account balances, pct of GDP - http://tmsnrt.rs/2HEN3pL)
Japan is the world's largest creditor, the net value of assets held by government, businesses and individuals topping 328 trillion Japanese yen ($2.92 trillion) at end-2017. Switzerland is also one of the world's biggest creditors, behind the likes of China and Germany. [nL3N1SV3YK]
That is what encouraged investors to pile resources into the yen, for instance, when North Korea tested ballistic missiles in 2017, or buy francs during the 2010-13 euro zone debt crisis. 
Both currencies also enjoy mammoth foreign exchange reserves, stable political systems, and the liquidity investors demand in times of market flux.
""If there is some horrendous geopolitical event, or the U.S. growth story turned around ... it will be the yen and the franc that people buy,"" said Rabobank strategist Jane Foley.
So, how to explain the currencies' lackluster run in 2018?
Firstly, their underperformance likely reflects a broadly benign climate: world growth of 3.5 percent-plus and double-digit company profit growth have helped counteract worries over politics and trade.
Second, there is the possibility that the carry trade -- a popular strategy in which investors borrow in lower-yielding currencies like the yen and franc to invest elsewhere -- is not as important in the current cycle.
Thirdly, currency volatility remains relatively low, at a third of the levels of 2015-2017 <.DBCVIX>. That has curbed demand for francs and yen even when political worries escalated, for instance in Italy over the summer.
""The relation of the yen to so-called risk-off is non-linear. It reacts much more to a sharp volatility spike,"" said Alvin Tan, currency strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
(Graphic: Franc shrugs off Italian saga - https://tmsnrt.rs/2IXWq5z)
The question for investors is what might roil investor sentiment to such an extent? And when?
Most agree a sharp and sustained 10-15 percent Wall Street slide that signaled the end of the long current bull market run, possibly coinciding with fears over U.S. and world growth, would be a catalyst.
""If you (have a) risk-aversion move because of global growth concerns, then you see the typical safe-havens like the Swiss franc, or specifically the yen, appreciate significantly,"" said Bernd Berg, global macro strategist at Switzerland-based Woodman Asset Management.
""And then you get the move to safe havens.""

175,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 04:17AM ET</span>",Euro wilts before EU decision on Italy budget,"By Tom Finn
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro fell toward a two-month low on Tuesday before a meeting by the European Commission on Italy's budget that could see Brussels take the unprecedented step of rejecting it and demanding changes.
A dispute over Italy's spending plans and doubts about the leadership of Britain's prime minister, mired in a stalemate over Brexit, means investors are focusing on the likelihood of further political turmoil in Europe. 
That contributed to broad risk aversion on Tuesday, with the safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc strengthening while higher-yielding currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollars fell.
Worries about Italy's spending has bred some doubt about the European Central Bank's plan to raise interest rates next summer and that has hurt the euro. On Tuesday, it fell 0.2 percent to $1.4390, nearing a two-month low of $1.4325 hit on Oct. 9. (EUR=EBS) 
Italy's bond yields ticked up on Tuesday before the meeting. Mario Centeno, the head of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, said on Monday he was confident an agreement could be reached.
""The prospect of a normalization of monetary policy was the main reason why the euro was able to appreciate over the past year. However, there is a rising risk that this support is now going to crumble,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Thu Lan Nguyen said.
Tensions are likely to heighten between Rome and Brussels, especially if the European Council launch an ""Excessive Deficit Procedure"" against Italy, said Philip Wee, currency strategist at DBS in a note.
""This would require Italy to provide a plan of corrective action to rein in its large public debt, currently at 130 percent of GDP vs the 60 percent Maastricht rule,"" Wee said.
The dollar index (DXY), a gauge of its value against six other major currencies, rose to a two-month high of 96.158 and traded up 0.1 percent. 
That was due to the turbulence in Europe continent and expectations that a strong U.S. economy may see the Federal Reserve raise rates faster than assumed. 
Britain's pound traded up 0.2 percent at $1.3 after falling on Monday on fears that the Irish border issue and disagreements within Britain's ruling Conservatives over Brexit could see Prime Minister Theresa May face a serious leadership challenge. 
""Whispers of a growing number of Tory MP rebels losing their patience with May have put the risks of a lengthy UK political impasse and a Brexit policy mistake (exiting the EU without a deal) back on the table,"" said Viraj Patel, a currency strategist at ING.
""We think this noise is likely to keep the pound on the back foot this week,"" he said.
The dollar weakened 0.4 percent against the Japanese yen  to trade at 112.32 yen, gaining as risk-shy investors retreated from Asia's main share markets.
The Australian dollar  lost 0.1 percent versus the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, changing hands at 0.7089. It lost 0.6 percent on Monday.

178,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",Pound's Brexit Swing Threatens to Rip Up BOE's Inflation Outlook,"(Bloomberg) -- The pound’s inevitable sharp move on the final Brexit outcome will have big implications for Bank of England policy.
Exchange-rate swings could push inflation up to almost 3 percent or slow it to well below the 2 percent target by early 2020, according to calculations by Bloomberg Economics. The direction will be determined by whether the U.K. leaves the European Union smoothly or without a divorce deal.
BOE officials, who are basing their forecasts on the average of a range of scenarios, have long said Brexit could lead them to move interest rates either up or down.
In testimony to lawmakers last week, BOE Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said that sterling’s current value reflects a number of Brexit outcomes, and that large moves are possible once investors get clarity.
Foreign-exchange strategists surveyed by Bloomberg agree, with the median estimate showing that the pound could drop about 8 percent if the U.K. crashes out of the bloc without a deal. Or it could rally 6 percent if Prime Minister Theresa May finds a way to get her current plan through Brussels and Westminster.
Such a swing would translate to about a 1 percentage point difference in the BOE’s inflation forecasts a year after the currency movement, according to Bloomberg Economics’s Dan Hanson.
BOE officials, who are due to announce their latest forecasts and policy decision next week, have hiked rates twice in the past year and say more increases are required. They are currently predicting a gradual decline in the inflation rate over their forecast horizon, returning to their 2 percent target in 2021.
Under a no deal scenario, the drop in the pound alone could add more than 0.5 percentage point to the inflation rate, Hanson estimates.
Assuming the decrease happened in the first quarter of next year, that would leave inflation approaching 3 percent by early 2020, even before the extra boost from tariffs and a potential slowdown in supply growth -- backing up Governor Mark Carney’s warnings that the BOE may have to respond to such an outcome with rate hikes.
“If we were to get no deal, sterling would have a long way to fall even though the market is short already,” said Jane Foley, head of currency strategy at Rabobank, who sees a 13 percent drop against the dollar in such an outcome. “That would be very worrying for the Bank of England.”
Conversely, the pound’s rally under a “good” Brexit would push inflation down by about 0.4 percentage point a year later, leaving the rate below officials’ target far sooner than they forecast.
The effect of just one aspect of Brexit -- in this case, the pound’s reaction -- shows how difficult a task the BOE faces in setting policy as talks drag on.
It also provides more evidence of how the current outlook, based on a Brexit with a smooth transition and little movement in the pound, is increasingly doubtful, and at risk of a major overhaul. Markets are currently pricing in just one more hike next year, though that could change quickly once Brexit negotiations conclude.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro rallied on Monday as a fall in Italian government borrowing costs after their recent surge introduced some calm into the market, while the promise of more Chinese stimulus helped offset broader political worries. 
Rating agency Moody's downgraded the Italian government's credit rating on Friday but unexpectedly kept the outlook at stable.
That, together with comments by Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio that the government was ready to sit down with the European Union amid the ongoing row over Rome's budget, boosted demand for Italian debt after a sharp selloff in recent weeks.
The euro has often fallen this year when Italian government bond yields have spiked higher.
The single currency rose 0.3 percent to $1.1550 (EUR=), hitting the day's high and away from recent lows of $1.1433.
The dollar index dropped 0.3 percent to 95.472 (DXY).
The euro was also 0.2 percent higher at 1.1487 Swiss francs (EURCHF=), and gained 0.2 percent versus sterling to 88.26 pence (EURGBP=).
Despite the euro's rally, analysts said it remained at the mercy of Italian developments, with a great deal of uncertainty ahead.
""...A full diary of risk events over the next two weeks and little to argue in favor of support from the ECB (European Central Bank) in the near future, the question remains over how far the yield gap can blow out and how this could translate back into the FX market,"" said Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon.
Equity markets were largely in positive territory as hopes that China's tax cuts next year could be worth more than one percent of gross domestic product sparked a rally in Asian shares that fed across to Europe.
That helped offset geopolitical concerns about the rift between Saudi Arabia and the West over the killing of a prominent critic of the kingdom, as well as worries about Britain securing an exit deal with the EU.
Forex markets were largely quiet, although the more positive tone at the start of the week did buoy sentiment.
For the dollar, a hawkish Federal Reserve and signs of continued strength in the U.S. economy remain key drivers. 
""Markets will be closely watching the release of the U.S. advance GDP number on Friday for more clarity on the direction of the U.S. dollar,"" said Sim Moh Siong, currency strategist at Bank of Singapore.
The dollar rose versus the Japanese yen . The yen fetched 112.71, down 0.2 percent on the day and off a one-month high of 111.61 touched on Oct. 15.
The yen had benefited from rising risk around Brexit, the Italy budget plan and trade tensions, because investors tend to buy the Japanese currency when they are nervous.
The Canadian dollar  changed hands at 1.3080 on its U.S. counterpart, within striking distance of a five-week low of 1.3132 hit on Friday on the back of weaker inflation and retail sales.
The Australian dollar , often considered a barometer for global risk appetite, traded at $0.7122, flat on the day.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Currency options investors are bracing for increased volatility and possible U.S. dollar weakness going into the U.S. midterm elections next month. 
But in the bond market, investors don't see the midterm election as a major catalyst for moves in interest rates.
Hedging activity increased in October in the yen, Australian and New Zealand dollars versus the greenback for maturities as far out as one year, strategists said.
Control of the U.S. Congress is at stake in the Nov. 6 election. Polls suggest the most likely outcome will be Democrats winning control of the House of Representatives with Republicans retaining the Senate. 
A divided Congress could mean government gridlock, and this prospect has spawned some complacency in the bond market. Investors believe this outcome would not change the underlying upward trajectory of U.S. economic growth nor the pace of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve, analysts said.
It's a different story, however, for the currency market where investors are pricing in election-related risks. 
""There has been a rise in hedging activity across all tenors for dollar/yen in October from the previous month that may be related to the U.S. midterm elections,"" said Alice Leng, quantitative strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in New York.
""The sharpest rise in volume is between six months to one-year. So the market right now is looking at longer-term risks,"" she added.
To be sure, there are other factors contributing to a rise in hedging such as the escalating trade conflict between the United States and China. Investors use options to protect positions or simply bet on event risk within certain periods of time.
The implied volatility or ""vol"" used by banks to price one-month options on dollar/yen rose as high as 6.8  on Friday. The metric reached 7.57 last week after hitting a nine-month low in September. Implied volatility measures expectations of increased moves in a currency pair in either direction.
Implied vols on six month to one-year maturities on dollar/yen also showed a pick-up, data showed.
(Graphic: Yen vol chart - https://tmsnrt.rs/2J5QXtF)
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) in a research note echoed Leng's views on currency option activity but highlighted that the event risk premium was smaller than during the 2016 presidential elections. 
Expected bond volatility one month from now, meanwhile, is at the lower end of its trading range for the year. It spiked earlier this month amid a bond market rout that propelled the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield  to a 7-1/2 year high.
A measure of one-month U.S. bond volatility compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch was 52.635 on Thursday, up from Wednesday but below a four-month peak on Oct. 11 (MERMOVE1M).
FX OPTIONS SHOW BEARISH DOLLAR BETS
Aside from increased volatility, dollar/yen's one-month risk reversal, an option market signal used to measure sentiment on currencies, showed bearish bets. 
One-month risk reversals on dollar/yen showed bets for a drop in the dollar against the yen , although bearish sentiment has eased a little bit.
Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC), head of North American FX strategy at TD Securities in Toronto, said there is a bit of ""a skew to the downside in the dollar"" ahead of the elections.
""A divided Congress could see the market start to question how much longer U.S. assets can outperform the rest of the world,"" McCormick said.
He cited the rising correlation between the strength in the dollar and the outperformance of U.S. equities the last few months, which he said could be highly sensitive to the U.S. midterms.
Hedging volume activity has also picked up in the longer-term options of the Australian and New Zealand dollars. Investors buy the Aussie and New Zealand dollar when investors have a higher risk appetite, and they tend to sell them in times of market uncertainty.
One-year Australian and New Zealand dollar implied vols have tracked an upward trend since early August  .

""Market participants are engaging in longer-term hedging activity, in case the election outcome has an impact on the broader market or the broader economy,"" she added.

Market dynamics have shifted only slightly since the European Central Bank’s last meeting, yet not in a supportive way for the common currency. Data may be suggesting the forecasts for growth are broadly on track with the Governing Council’s projections, but on the other hand subdued inflation, early signs of contagion in peripheral bonds, deadlocked Brexit negotiations and a hawkish Federal Reserve could mean the euro could test its $1.1301 mid-August low.
Draghi said he sees a “relatively vigorous” pickup in underlying euro-area inflation following the September monetary policy decision and while wage pressure is building, the pass-through to prices is yet to be seen. At a time when the market looks behind the curve when it comes to additional U.S. tightening, there may be little room for the ECB president to downplay monetary policy divergence projections at the next gathering on Oct. 25.
Price action in the spot market this month showed that the euro could benefit from a Brexit resolution. U.K. and EU officials keep kicking the can down the road however as obstacles remain, with focus now turning to a December EU summit, as volatility shows. European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker present conclusions from the Oct. 18-19 summit to the EU Parliament next week, with the bar high for a positive surprise.
For the short-term, investors are looking closely at the performance of euro-area peripheral bonds as the rift between Italy and the EU widens. Italy’s 10-year yield spread over Germany touched the highest in more than five years following a letter from the European Commission to Rome that said its spending plans were excessive. While resilience was the name of the game initially, Spanish bonds led the widening versus bunds on Thursday and the 10-year Portugal yield rose by 8 basis points Friday to 2.11 percent, highest since May.
The euro flirted with a two-month low Friday, hitting $1.1433, just one pip higher than its mid-August trough. Bloomberg’s fear-greed indicator shows bears are in firm control of price action, while a crossover in short-term moving averages suggests the latest rally for the dollar has legs to follow. On the weekly chart, a close below $1.1457 opens the room for a test of the $1.1300 handle.
Leveraged names may be short the euro already, yet model names are seen selling technical breaks, according to two traders in Europe, who asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak publicly. As the market looks short gamma below $1.1400, further weakness for the common currency could mean traders will need to chase the market lower. As long as the euro stays below its 55-daily moving average, currently at $1.1579, bulls will be kept on their toes.

The USD/CNY pair fell 0.1% to 6.9376 by 1:13 AM ET (05:13 GMT).
China’s economic growth slowed to 6.5% year-on-year, compared with the general consensus of a 6.6% growth. It was the weakest pace since the first quarter of 2009.
On a quarterly basis, GDP grew 1.6% in the third quarter, in line with expectations but slower than the 1.8% growth in April-June.
Reports said Beijing’s official growth target for 2018 is around 6.5%.
Earlier in the day, the chief of China’s CSRC said that Beijing will extend its support to non-state backed listed companies, while the PBOC governor said low market valuations and market volatility are mainly due to investor sentiment, rather than China’s economic fundamentals.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The euro hovered near a one-week low against the dollar on Friday as the European Commission's criticism of Italy's populist budget sparked fresh concerns about political tensions in the common currency zone.
The dollar index (DXY), a gauge of its value against major peers, was 0.05 percent higher at 95.96 on Friday, having closed on Thursday at its highest level since Aug. 21. That rise was driven by a steep fall in the euro on Thursday, which constitutes around 57 percent of the index.
The euro (EUR=) was relatively flat at $1.1454 on Friday, steadying slightly after losing 0.4 percent overnight. The single currency hit its lowest intra-day level of 1.1447 since Oct. 9 on Thursday after the European Commission said Italy's 2019 budget draft is in serious breach of European Union budget rules.
The Commission said in a letter to Italian Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, that planned government spending was too high, the structural deficit - excluding one-offs and business cycle effects - would rise instead, not fall, and that Italian public debt would not come down in line with EU rules.
This has sparked investor concerns about more political tensions in the EU between Brussels and member states, which has hurt the euro.
The gap between Italian and German 10-year bond yield spreads hit its widest level in 5-1/2 years after news of the Commission letter broke.
Italy's prime minister defended the nation's free spending budget, though markets were not impressed.
""The euro decline reflects the build up of political tension in the eurozone,"" said Sim Moh Siong, currency strategist at Bank of Singapore.
""The next support for the euro is at 1.1430, a break of which can take us down to 1.13."" 
The British pound  hit a fresh 11-day low on Friday, but rebounded slightly to quote at $1.3020 versus the dollar.
Traders placed bearish bets on the sterling as a EU-UK summit failed to yield a decision on Britain's exit from the euro zone.
British Prime Minister Theresa May, on Thursday said that the European Union's proposal on the Irish border was unacceptable.
""Unless we get positive noises from Brussels, the impasse on Brexit and softer economic data suggests that the pound could underperform,"" said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of currency strategy in a note.
The Japanese yen  weakened 0.17 percent versus the dollar on Friday, to trade at 112.31.
The greenback lost 0.4 percent of its value to the yen on Thursday, reflecting the global risk-off mood due to rising geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, Italy's budget woes and U.S-Sino trade war tensions.
Wall street benchmark equity indices also tumbled more than 1.2 percent each, with technology stocks leading the pack.
China's economic growth in the third quarter slowed to 6.5 percent, its weakest pace since 2009 and below expectations, as a campaign to tackle debt risks and the trade war with the United States weighed on the economy.
The yuan  changed hands at 6.9339 on Friday, trading flat versus the dollar, after recovering from its intra-day low of 6.9416.
""Expectations have increased for the Chinese yuan to depreciate towards its psychological 7 level against the USD,"" said Eugene Leow, rates strategist at DBS in a note.

Net immigration in the third quarter was the lowest for that period in four years, Statistics New Zealand data showed Friday. The annual number has dropped to less than 63,000 from a peak of 72,400 in July last year.
Departures have jumped as people employed on building projects after the 2011-12 Christchurch earthquakes leave the country and more residents move to Australia, which has historically offered better prospects for many Kiwi workers.
The net outflow of New Zealand residents to Australia increased to almost 6,400 in the year through September. It was more than five times that level at its peak, suggesting there’s ample scope for immigration to slow further.
“The pick-up in annual departures was broad-based,” said Mark Smith, senior economist at ASB Bank in Auckland. “We expect annual net inflows to continue to recede from record highs, reaching around 40,000 persons by the end of next year.”

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.31% to 95.65.
The Philadelphia Fed said Thursday its manufacturing index fell to a reading of 22.2 in October, below 22.9 last month but above economists' estimates for 19.7.
The U.S. Department of Labor, meanwhile said initial jobless claims dropped by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 210,000 for the week ended Oct. 13, beating economists’ forecast for a drop to 211,000.
The pair of reports underlined the strength to the U.S. economy, reaffirming investor expectations for further rates hike following the somewhat hawkish Fed minutes released on Wednesday.
The majority of Federal Reserve members said they expected the central bank would increase rates beyond the neutral level over the longer run, according to the minutes.
Trader expectations for the December rate hike jumped to more than 90%, from about 80% on Wednesday prior to the release of the minutes, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Higher interest rates have been blamed for recent market turbulence, particularly in equity markets.
Trump on Tuesday said the Fed was his ""biggest threat"" because it was raising rates too fast.

In a break from recent releases, Treasury devoted a section Wednesday to outlining concerns with China’s bilateral trade surplus and said the U.S. was “deeply disappointed” that the Asian nation doesn’t disclose its FX interventions. The department also cautioned that it will be monitoring whether countries “resist depreciation pressure in the same manner as appreciation pressure.”
The focus on China portends more turbulence ahead for financial markets, according to  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV. The Chinese yuan slid Thursday in a move that some market participants expect to continue. Given the currency’s role in determining global risk sentiment, emerging-market currencies may be poised for more pain, said ING currency strategist Viraj Patel.
“The latest Treasury report came across as basically a final warning over Beijing’s currency policy,” London-based wrote Patel in an email. “The currency pair is fast turning into a bargaining chip in U.S.-China trade talks, and that makes us nervous.”
The offshore yuan fell as much as 0.3 percent to 6.9514 per dollar Thursday, reaching the weakest on a closing basis since January 2017. A break above the psychological 7.0 level would likely spell trouble for other Asian currencies, Patel said.
Regional Laggard
The yuan has declined about 10 percent against the greenback in the past six months, trailing many Asian peers. The cheapening has drawn the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump and fueled speculation that China is deliberately weakening its currency as trade relations between the two nations sour.
October’s report “lays the groundwork for giving Treasury the option of naming China next time for failing to intervene to block depreciation pressure with sufficient force,” according to Brad Setser, a former Treasury official. “My guess is that the White House might say Treasury should name China if the bilateral deficit keeps growing and China doesn’t resist depreciation pressures.”
While formally naming China a manipulator wouldn’t have triggered immediate sanctions or other U.S. penalties, it would have further soured an already tense relationship between the world’s two largest economies.
‘Glaring’ Failure
The U.S. got the main conclusions “largely right,” given that there’s no basis to accuse China of manipulation, according to ex-Treasury official Mark Sobel. However, Treasury’s lack of comment on the strengthening dollar’s role in contributing to the U.S. current account deficit amounts to a “glaring” failure, he said.
“Rather than admit heavy U.S. responsibility for these currency developments, the Treasury takes aim at renminbi depreciation,” Sobel wrote in a blog post for the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, where he’s U.S. chairman.
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has climbed more than 6 percent since mid-April amid Federal Reserve rate increases and strong U.S. economic growth, spurred in part by fiscal stimulus.
The stepped-up criticism of China’s currency practices puts more focus on November’s potential meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit. Currencies linked to Chinese growth -- such as the Australian dollar -- will remain under pressure amid the tensions, according to  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).
“The singling out of China suggests that the U.S. administration stands ready to do more on China should discussions between Trump and Xi not bear fruit” next month, Calvin Tse, the bank’s North American head of G-10 FX strategy, wrote in a note."

(Reuters) - Short positions on most Asian currencies were seen unwinding over the past two weeks, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday, with traders turning skeptical of the dollar's (DXY) bull run after U.S. retail sales data came in below expectations. 
Moreover, the run-up to the U.S. mid-term elections next month and related political uncertainty is also expected to weigh on the greenback, which has gained nearly 4 percent this year against a basket of currencies (DXY), thereby providing support to regional currencies. 
Bearish bets on the Singapore dollar , Taiwan dollar  and the Philippine peso  declined over the past two weeks, a poll of 10 respondents showed. The currencies had suffered heavy losses over the last fortnight, hurt by a confluence of factors including higher crude oil prices and brewing global trade tensions. 
Short positions on the Thai baht  fell to the lowest since late May. Strong economic fundamentals have bolstered sentiment for the baht, which is the best performer amongst its peers in the year so far. 
Bearish bets on the Singapore dollar also fell to the lowest level since late May. The export-reliant economy's non-oil shipments rose 8 percent in September despite ongoing trade tensions.
The country's central bank tightened monetary policy last week and had posited a strong outlook for the economy.
Meanwhile, bears on the South Korean won  hiked their stakes to the highest level since early August. The country's central bank held its benchmark rates as expected, and said a rate hike in November was almost certain.
Global trade tensions have dampened South Korea's economic outlook due to its close ties with China, which accounts for a bulk of the country's exports.
Short positions on the Chinese yuan  rose slightly, with the currency touching its weakest levels in 21 months on Thursday, as a trade war with the United States continued to hurt sentiment. Strong Chinese export data did little to deter yuan shorts, as market participants believe that the real brunt of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods is yet to be felt.
Markets will closely watch China's third-quarter GDP data this Friday to gauge the effects of the conflict. A Reuters poll predicted that China's third-quarter growth will slow to its weakest pace since the global financial crisis with domestic demand expected to falter.
Bearish bets on the Indonesian rupiah  and the Indian rupee  were the highest. The two currencies are the worst performers among their peers this year, as both the countries have large current account deficit and are heavily dependent on oil imports. 
Weak domestic currencies had recently prompted market intervention from the central banks of both the countries, with the Indonesian central bank tightening its monetary policy in September for the fifth time since mid-May.
Bears on the rupiah raised their positions to the highest level in more than five years while shorts on the rupee eased slightly.
The Reuters survey is focused on what analysts believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3.

A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars. The figures included positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar traded stronger versus its major peers on Thursday after minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's September meeting affirmed expectations that the central bank is likely to continue raising interest rates this year.
Every Fed policymaker backed raising interest rates last month and also generally agreed borrowing costs were set to rise further.
Interest rate futures are now pricing in an 83 percent likelihood that the Fed raises rates in December, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, the fourth hike this year. Two more increases are likely next year.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures its value against six major peers, traded at 95.664, up 0.1 percent on Thursday.
""The dollar is being bid as there is follow through support post the release of the FOMC minutes,"" said Ray Attrill, head of currency strategy at NAB.
""Dollar bulls are playing to the view that the market is under-pricing what the U.S. Fed can do,"" added Attrill. 
U.S. benchmark 10-year treasury yields  climbed to 3.2 percent on Thursday. The last time they traded below the psychologically important 3 percent level was Sept. 18.

The Australian dollar, often considered a barometer of global risk appetite, changed hands at $0.7126 on Thursday, gaining 0.24 percent versus the greenback on the back of a strong unemployment report.
The Aussie hit a two-year low of $0.7039 on Oct. 5 and analysts still expect the currency to remain under pressure.
""The combination of a strengthening U.S. dollar and commodity price pressures could bring a test of the two-year low around $0.7040 in the coming sessions,"" said Sydney based Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.
Elsewhere, in a document keenly awaited by markets, the U.S. Treasury Department's semi-annual currency report, released on Wednesday, did not name China or any other trading partner as a currency manipulator.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Wednesday refrained from naming China or any other trading partner as a currency manipulator as it leans on tariffs to try to cut a massive trade deficit with China.
In its semi-annual currency report, the U.S. Treasury Department said a recent depreciation of China's yuan currency will likely exacerbate the U.S. trade deficit but U.S. officials found Beijing appeared to be doing little to directly intervene in the currency's value.
U.S. President Donald Trump has claimed that China's rise as an exporting powerhouse has hurt U.S. workers and since taking office he has ordered tariffs on more than $200 billion in Chinese imports. 
""Of particular concern are China's lack of currency transparency and the recent weakness in its currency,"" said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. 
Since the Treasury's last currency report was issued on April 13, the yuan has fallen by more than 9 percent against the dollar.  
In the last week, the currency has pushed closer to the key 7 to the dollar threshold, a level not breached since 2008. Some currency derivatives show market participants expect the yuan to weaken past that level within a year.
The Treasury noted reports that China was trying to counter some of the yuan depreciation and said China could bolster confidence in the yuan by engaging in more market-friendly reforms.
""Treasury is deeply disappointed that China continues to refrain from disclosing its foreign exchange intervention,"" the department said in its report. 
It added that China should advance macroeconomic reforms that support greater household consumption growth and help rebalance the economy away from investment.
China's multi-decade investment boom has helped make it the world's factory floor and fueled a trade surplus in goods with the United States of $390 billion in the 12 months through June. 
Some China experts have speculated that Beijing could use yuan devaluation as a weapon in a broader trade war with the United States.

The Treasury also said it has was keeping China, India, Japan, Germany, South Korea and Switzerland on a monitoring list for extra scrutiny.

Still, moves were muted in currency markets, contrary to the big gains in global stocks and drops in government bond yields in markets such as Italy.

206,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 04:50PM ET</span>","Dollars Are Out, Euros Are In as U.S. Sanctions Sting Venezuela","(Bloomberg) -- Venezuela said it will shun the greenback and inject 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) into its sinking economy as U.S. sanctions limit the cash-strapped nation’s access to capital markets.
Economy Vice President Tareck El Aissami said Tuesday that going forward all government auctions of foreign exchange would be quoted in euro, yuan and other hard currencies due to a so-called financial blockade imposed by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the country’s political opposition.
“Various actors continue to attack our financial system,"" El Aissami said in remarks broadcast on television. “We are not going to give in to foreign and imperialist interests.”
Venezuela’s ruling socialists have struggled to tame hyperinflation and address the collapse of what had once been one of Latin America’s most affluent countries: Wide-scale hunger, and the breakdown of public services has seen millions of citizens flee the oil-rich country for neighboring countries, creating region’s largest-ever migration crisis.
President Nicolas Maduro has vowed to bring about economic recovery since winning another six-year term in widely-criticized election this year. Still, his administration has struggled to attract much needed investment amid a raft of sanctions on Venezuelan debt and its beleaguered oil sector. The government’s actions Tuesday won’t alter the hard fact that it’s the black market where Venezuelans go to acquire dollars.
‘Economic Sabotage’
El Aissami said the government would open bank accounts in Europe and Asia as potential workarounds to financial sanctions. Venezuela’s banking sector will now be able to participate in currency auctions three times a week, he said, adding that the government would sell some 2 billion euros amid a rebound in oil prices.
“The illegal measures will continue to damage the national economic system, and this is why we have made these decisions,” El Aissami said.
Venezuela’s government insists the country’s woes are the result of “economic sabotage,” while analysts largely blame a complicated system of price and currency controls for stymieing local production and warping the economy.
The Tuesday announcement comes after the government said in August it would soon overhaul its Dicom currency auction system and allow both businesses and individuals to buy dollars at a “single, fluctuating rate.” Maduro rolled out the revamped system in September but finds himself having to shore it up a month later.
The late President Hugo Chavez established currency controls in 2003 in a bid to stem capital flight. The efforts to regulate the sale of hard currency backfired as the state struggled to supply dollars amid crashing commodity prices and rampant corruption, giving way to a thriving black market for greenbacks.
Officially, dollars sell for around 63 bolivars on the Dicom platform. They currently fetch over 130 on the street.

212,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>",Treasury Report Tests Trump’s Claim of China Currency Manipulation,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Treasury is poised to render a verdict on President Donald Trump’s claim that China is manipulating its currency as a trade war between the two nations intensifies and rattles markets.
While the U.S. hasn’t designated China as a currency manipulator since 1994, Wall Street is bracing for the prospect that the Treasury Department will do so this week in its semi-annual foreign-exchange report. Such a move wouldn’t trigger penalties, but it would likely escalate tensions between the world’s two largest economies.
Treasury staff have recommended to Secretary Steven Mnuchin that China doesn’t meet the criteria to be labeled a currency manipulator, according to two people familiar with the matter. The criteria established by Congress include: a minimum $20 billion trade surplus with the U.S.; a current account surplus in excess of 3 percent of GDP; and repeated interventions in currency markets.
Traders are watching several other Asian and European currencies that could be called out in the report. Here are five things to watch:
1. China
Trump has repeatedly said China keeps the yuan artificially weak, making its exports cheaper. The currency, also called the renminbi, has tumbled more than 9 percent against the dollar over the past six months. The U.S. is concerned about the depreciation, and wants to make sure it’s not being used as a competitive devaluation, Mnuchin said in an interview in Bali Thursday.
The yuan’s drop has been fueled at least in part by market forces from the trade dispute, according to Mark Sobel, a former U.S. Treasury official who worked at the department for nearly four decades.
“Trade tensions are contributing to the softening Chinese economy and a weaker currency,” Sobel said. “When Trump threatens, or actually hits China with trade tariffs, the renminbi depreciates. As tensions rose, pressures on the renminbi intensified.”
People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang used the IMF meetings to say the government won’t use its currency as a tool to deal with the trade conflict even as a tariff war with the U.S. intensifies.
Still, the White House is pressuring Mnuchin to publicly shame China, and Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg News last month that the U.S. is “looking very strongly at the formula” it uses to evaluate possible manipulation. Mnuchin has gotten more involved than usual in the currency analysis, people familiar with the matter have said.
2. More countries scrutinized
Treasury in April said it may expand the number of countries it examines. An expanded list could include Russia, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Ireland or Malaysia, all of which have large trade surpluses with the U.S.
Expanding the list would be a “clear signal of intent that the administration wants greater transparency on the currency policy of key trading partners,” said Viraj Patel, a currency strategist at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV in London. “Implicitly it also signals the intent to avoid ‘too strong’ a dollar in the medium-term and this is a subtle but important shift in dollar policy that shouldn’t be taken lightly.”
3. India
India was unexpectedly added to Treasury’s currency watch list in April for its significant trade surplus with the U.S. and increased purchases of foreign currency last year. This year it’s been doing the opposite, with the Reserve Bank of India spending over $26 billion trying to shore up the rupee, Asia’s worst performing major currency in 2018.
One criterion for being labeled a currency manipulator is a trade surplus with the U.S. of $20 billion or more. India’s was at $22.9 billion in 2017.
4. Thailand
If Thailand is added to Treasury’s twice-yearly review, analysts widely agree that it could be branded a currency manipulator because it meets all three criteria set by Congress.
5. Germany
Trump has criticized European Union countries for “manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower.” Germany, which has been on Treasury’s monitoring list since April 2016, has faced the toughest criticism from Trump and the Treasury over its large current account surplus.

213,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",Yen Reigns Supreme Over Franc as a Haven When Markets Get Messy,"(Bloomberg) -- There’s only one trade to make in foreign-exchange markets when investors are running away from risk: buy the yen.
That’s the view of analysts at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). who compared the performance of the Japanese currency with the Swiss franc on days when the S&P 500 Index incurred losses of 2 percent or more. While Switzerland’s currency was clearly the better haven before the global financial crisis of 2008, the yen has “emphatically” taken the top spot since then, according to a note from analysts including Calvin Tse.
The yen certainly proved itself to be the stronger of the two last week. It surged by almost 1.4 percent against the greenback in a period that saw the American equity benchmark record two consecutive daily declines of more than 2 percent. The franc rose just 0.6 percent over the same period.
“With the outlook for market volatility to stay high going into the end of the year, more frequent bouts of risk aversion are likely to emerge,” the Citigroup analysts wrote. “There is only one standout safe haven currency to own.”
Citi’s analysis shows that when the epicenter of risk aversion is in Europe, the yen tends to outperform the franc, debunking conventional wisdom that the Swiss currency should benefit in such situations. For Asia-focused episodes, there is no clear bias between the two.
The analysts highlight several potential reasons for the yen assuming the mantle of top shelter from 2008 onward, including greater position short-covering for the yen, changes to Swiss banking regulations and the cheapening of the yen against the franc. They also pointed to a larger pool of Japanese assets abroad, which allows for greater repatriation than in the case of Switzerland.
Differences in central-bank FX policy are also key. The Bank of Japan has intervened in currency markets on just eight days since the crisis, while the Swiss National Bank has gotten involved on a regular basis in a bid to check franc strength, the analysts said.
“With the JPY being cheap, the Japanese having the largest private net international investment position in the world, and the BoJ taking a non-interventionist approach, there’s only one FX trade in risk off – you buy the JPY,” the analysts wrote."

The pound rose last week to a one-month high against the dollar on hopes the two sides were close to a breakthrough, easing fears of a 'no-deal' British exit from the bloc next March. 
But sterling traded back at one-week lows on Monday  amid a stalemate over the post-Brexit status of Britain's land border with Ireland, puncturing optimism before an EU summit on Wednesday.
Even if May and EU authorities reach agreement, a likely second battle with her own party in London over that issue - the biggest outstanding hurdle - has generally left investors wary of taking big cash sterling positions.
""I wouldn't be rushing to buy sterling. We could easily see the pound at $1.15 or $1.45,"" said Derek Halpenny, European head of global markets research at MUFG.
The scenario of binary Brexit outcomes has prompted mainly caution.
The British currency has traded mostly in a range of 86 to 90 pence against the euro (EURGBP=D3) over the last year. It has swung more violently versus the dollar but that's probably down to the greenback's own volatility in 2018.
Taking out protection against sterling losses, via three- and six-month options contracts providing a hedge against a 'no deal' Brexit has been a popular trade. 
For now, there is no sign of this picture changing.
Many of May's lawmakers who want a cleaner break from Europe, and Northern Ireland's DUP, the party she depends on for her parliamentary majority, have threatened to vote against next year's budget, potentially bringing down her government.
Such events could bring ""months of up and downs for sterling,"" MUFG'S Halpenny said.
BAD NEWS PRICED IN?
Over 80 percent of strategists in a recent Reuters poll predicted sterling to be higher in a year than its current $1.32 levels because so much bad news is already priced in.
But between now and then, much seems uncertain.
Three-month sterling implied volatility, a gauge of future fluctuations, is approaching its highest levels this year at more than 9 percent, far above implied vols on euro and Japanese yen and even higher than some emerging market currencies. 
Around $1 billion worth of sterling options expire at the end of this week, Refinitiv data shows. They are bunched around $1.28-$1.32, roughly the range sterling has traded in since May.
The final chance for May of reaching a deal during 2019 now appears to be a summit in December, but optimism is limited - for instance, only 38 percent of Nomura's clients said in a survey they expected a deal by year-end.
Meanwhile speculative positions remain broadly negative and derivatives continue to signal nervousness. Futures data shows short pound positions by hedge funds remain near-17-month highs of $4.97 billion.
Another sign traders are bracing for sterling weakness comes from risk reversals  , a gauge of the difference in demand for puts - betting an asset's price will fall - and calls - betting it will rise.
The most liquid three-month risk reversal is at the widest since September 2016. In other words, bearishness on sterling is at its highest in two years. 
""Even if we see a deal, the upside for sterling will be around 5 percent from current levels but risks for a sharp drop in the pound have also grown substantially as can be seen from FX derivatives,"" said Charles St-Arnaud, a senior investment strategist at Lombard Odier Asset Management in London.
That concern is also manifest elsewhere in options markets where demand has risen for out-of-the money puts on the British currency, especially against the euro. Such puts tend to be relatively cheap because their strike prices are below current market levels.

""The possibility of an early election, a referendum, or prolonged standstill all remain very real,"" said George Saravelos, co-head of foreign-exchange research at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), who estimates the chance of a deal passing parliament at 50 percent.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.23% to 94.72.
The Commerce Department said on Monday that core retail sales fell 0.1% last month. That confounded economists’ forecast for a 0.4% rise. The retail sales control group, which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP, rose 0.5% beating expectations for a 0.3% rise.
""These data mean that third quarter consumers’ spending likely rose by 3.6%-to-3.8%, after a 3.8% leap in the second quarter. This uplift from the prior trend, about 2%-to-2.5%, likely is due to the tax cuts, so it won’t be sustained,"" Pantheon said. ""We expect sub-3% consumption in fourth quarter.""
A rebound in both the pound and euro from session also pressured the greenback even as investors digested negative news on stalled Brexit talks and ongoing friction between the EU and Italy.
U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May told Parliament Monday that while talks with the European Union had resulted in progress, the status of the Irish border has remained a critical stumbling block.
Profit-taking on dollar-denominated assets explains ""why despite failing Brexit talks, persistent disagreements between EU and Italy and falling equity prices, the buck can't find a bid,"" said BK Asset management.
GBP/USD edged up 0.08% to $1.3166, while EUR/USD rose 0.27% to $1.1590.
USD/CAD fell 0.47% to C$1.2964 after the release of an upbeat Bank of Canada outlook survey.
USD/JPY fell 0.33% to Y111.83 as demand for safe-haven demand was propped up by mixed trading on Wall Street.
In emerging-market currencies, meanwhile, the Turkish lira rose against the dollar, hitting a two-month high, after Turkey on Friday released U.S. pastor Andrew Brunson.
USD/TRY fell 1.44% 5.778."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar dipped on Monday after retail sales data for September missed economists’ expectations, and as benchmark U.S. Treasury yields consolidated after last week hitting their highest level in seven years.
U.S. retail sales barely rose in September as a rebound in motor vehicle purchases was offset by the biggest drop in spending at restaurants and bars in nearly two years.
Retail sales edged up only 0.1 percent in the month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an increase of 0.6 percent.
“We had softer than expected retail sales, that was another leg of dollar selling,” said Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
It comes after data last week showed that U.S. consumer prices rose less than expected in September, held back by a slower increase in the cost of rent and falling energy prices, as underlying inflation pressures appeared to cool.
Higher 10-year Treasury yields, which on Tuesday shot to 3.26 percent, helped to boost the greenback last week. With yields now having retraced to 3.15 percent, investors are looking for fresh impetus for dollar buying.
“Until we get another leg up in U.S. yields, the dollar’s going to be sort of in limbo,” said Thin.
Safe haven currencies the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc gained on Monday as European stocks tumbled to 22-month lows, with rising tensions between Western powers and Saudi Arabia adding to a cocktail of concerns that battered global stocks last week.
Saudi Arabia has been under pressure since a prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of Riyadh and a U.S. resident, disappeared on Oct. 2 after visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's Bavarian sister party also said on Monday it would back political stability in Berlin after suffering big losses in a regional election which their far-right foes hailed as ""an earthquake"" that would rock the coalition government.
""I don't think (the German election result is) a huge political risk, but it does tell you that political risks in Europe are not going away,"" said Alvin Tan, a currencies analyst at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in London.

GBP/USD was down 0.28% to 1.3119 by 04:49 AM ET (08:49 AM GMT), while EUR/GBP was up 0.2% to 0.8810.
The pound came under pressure after talks between Britain’s Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and the European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier ended in a stand-off ahead of Wednesday’s EU leaders summit.
The lack of progress towards a Brexit deal added to a cocktail of geopolitical risks weighing on market sentiment.
Markets were watching developments in the euro zone, where Italy’s government was expected to approve its new budget, despite criticism from Brussels that it will breach EU fiscal rules.
A Bavarian state parliament election on Saturday saw the ruling Christian Social Union party lose its majority, in a blow to German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government.
Meanwhile, oil prices were pushed higher by rising diplomatic tensions between Saudi Arabia and the West over the disappearance of a journalist.
Global equity markets failed to rebound on Monday, despite Friday’s gains on Wall Street after a sharp selloff last week triggered by worries over rising U.S. yields and concerns that trade wars are starting to act as a drag on global growth.
The safe haven yen gained ground, with USD/JPY down 0.45% to 111.70.
The Swiss franc, also sought as a refuge in times of market turmoil, was higher against the dollar with USD/CHF down 0.3% to 0.9900.

The USD/CNY pair slipped 0.06% to 6.9193 by 11:20PM ET (03:20 GMT). The Chinese currency has plunged more than 9% against the dollar in the past six months as worsening domestic economic outlook and tighter U.S. monetary policies were cited as headwind for the currency.
Despite recent fall in the yuan, PBOC governor Yi Gang said the currencies’ volatility is normal. “The currency has a flexible exchange rate mechanism, which now shows two-way fluctuation,” Yi said on Sunday in Bali during the IMF and World Bank’s meetings.
“For the full year, the yuan will stay in a reasonable range against the backdrop of an appreciating dollar,"" he added.
Yi then added that the fluctuation of yuan is much smaller than other currencies in developing economies and “basically similar” to those in developed countries.
“Economic growth, employment, inflation and the two-way fluctuation of the yuan are within reasonable range,” he said.
The People's Bank of China set the yuan reference rate at 6.9154 on Monday vs Friday's fix of 6.9120.
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies rose 0.11% to 95.04.
The Japanese yen rose against the dollar as the USD/JPY pair traded 0.11% lower to 112.08, after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said during the weekend that Washington wants to incorporate a provision to prevent currency manipulation in future trade deals, including with Japan.
The yen traded higher in the last six out of seven trading sessions versus the dollar, as safe-haven demand increased during the global stocks sell-off last week.
The AUD/USD pair and the NZD/USD pair both traded 0.1% higher."
219,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 14, 2018 09:20PM ET</span>","Don't Bet on China's Yuan Falling Past 7 Soon, Survey Shows","(Bloomberg) -- China is unlikely to let the yuan weaken past the key psychological level of 7 per dollar any time soon, according to market observers.
Just three of 18 traders and analysts surveyed Wednesday and Thursday said the Chinese currency will breach that milestone in 2018, though a majority see it happening by the middle of next year. Falling beyond 7 for the first time in a decade would further strain relations with the U.S. and spur capital outflows, some respondents said. The yuan fell 0.37 percent to 6.9146 per dollar Friday.
The yuan edged close to 7 last week after the People’s Bank of China announced a cut to the reserve requirement ratio for a fourth time this year, reflecting a growing divergence with U.S. monetary policy. Pressure on the currency, which has tumbled 9 percent over six months, eased in the past few days amid reports Donald Trump and Xi Jinping plan to meet in November and that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is being advised not to name China a currency manipulator.
How bears sped up building options wagers betting the yuan will hit 7
“We expect that the trade uncertainty will keep the yuan weak, but the Chinese authorities likely want to avoid a situation of snowballing negativity surrounding the currency,” said Julian Wee, an investment strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Private Banking in Singapore. “Existing capital controls and improving economic data from policy stimulus should help to partially counter the negative impact of the trade tensions.”
Including the three who see a break of 7 this year, 11 respondents expect the yuan to pass that mark by the end of June, citing reasons from a stronger greenback to a worsening trade conflict. There’s some disagreement on the consequences of a move beyond 7: Mizuho Bank Ltd.’s Ken Cheung said falling past that level would be “catastrophic to China’s economy and financial stability,” while  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc’s Ding Shuang doesn’t foresee large outflows due to capital controls.
Here are some highlights of respondents’ views:
Mizuho Bank (Ken Cheung, senior Asian currency strategist)
Standard Chartered (Ding Shuang, Greater China and North Asia chief economist)
United Overseas Bank (Heng Koon How, head of markets strategy)
Malayan Banking Berhad (Fiona Lim, senior currency analyst)
Bloomberg’s survey involved 12 strategists, economists and researchers based in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing and Singapore, and six currency traders at Chinese banks. Survey respondents who agreed to be identified were from Scotiabank, Mizuho, Standard Chartered, DBS Bank Hong Kong Ltd., Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Malayan Banking Bhd, China Financial Futures Exchange, United Overseas Bank, China Merchants Bank Co., Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Natixis SA and Credit Suisse Private Banking.

“Despite intense efforts, some key issues are still open,” including the backstop for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to avoid a hard border, tweeted European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier after meeting British counterpart Dominic Raab in Brussels on Sunday.
Sterling fell 0.5 percent against the dollar to 1.3085, a one-week low. Spot sterling had risen as much as 5 percent from a year-to-date low of 1.2662 reached in August, as hopes for a resolution to the Brexit impasse grew.
We met today @DominicRaab and UK negotiating team. Despite intense efforts, some key issues are still open, including the backstop for IE/NI to avoid a hard border. I will debrief the EU27 and @Europarl_EN on the #Brexit negotiations.
— Michel Barnier (@MichelBarnier) October 14, 2018
U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May is set to meet EU counterparts on Wednesday. A meeting of EU governments scheduled for Monday has been canceled, several diplomats said, and there will be no more negotiations before leaders meet on Wednesday. If the process were to fall apart, leaders have until a planned December gathering to decide what to do.
The need to limit the time Britain stays in the EU tariff regime is one of May’s headaches, with pro-Brexit ministers threatening to quit if she keeps the country locked in indefinitely. She also faces opposition to her plans from the Northern Irish party her government relies on for votes in Parliament. Those party leaders have said they will not accept a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
The risks to a bullish sterling view include leaders not agreeing on the Brexit divorce terms this week, as well as U.K. lawmakers not ratifying such a settlement in Parliament later in the year. The Democratic Unionist Party in Northern Ireland has reportedly refused to back her fiscal plans if a solution to the Irish border conundrum isn’t found.
Both the U.K. and the EU have stepped up contingency planning in case negotiations fail. Britain’s Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond said last week he was readying the government’s reserves in case Brexit hits the economy and he needs to intervene.

225,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>","As Brexit talks progress, UK PM May struggles to find support at home","By Costas Pitas and Andrew MacAskill
LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May was struggling on Friday to find consensus on Brexit proposals that would be acceptable to her ministers, her Conservative Party and the Northern Irish lawmakers who prop up her minority government. 
Brexit negotiations with the European Union have accelerated and become more positive over the past week, though significant hurdles remain, finance minister Philip Hammond said.
""What has happened over the last week, 10 days, is that there has been a measurable change in pace,"" he told the BBC. 
""But that shouldn't conceal the fact that we still have some big differences left to resolve,"" Hammond said. ""So process is a lot more positive this week - substance still very challenging.""
With less than six months to go until the United Kingdom is due to leave the EU, May is seeking to rally support at home on the details of a divorce deal though it is unclear if she can win parliament's approval for any agreement.
Britain warned on Friday that leaving the EU without a divorce deal would mean drugmakers needing to stockpile experimental treatments from remaining member states in case of border delays. Professional qualifications from European nations may no longer be recognized in Britain, it added.
The government, which has warned of a no-deal Brexit, published more than 25 technical notices covering issues from consumer rights and sanctions policy to rail transport and taking horses abroad.
But British and EU negotiators are making headway on the Irish border issue, the biggest hurdle to an overall agreement, and hope for a Brexit deal breakthrough on Monday, diplomats said.
The Irish border ""backstop"", which seeks a way to avoid customs checks on the frontier between the British province of Northern Ireland and Ireland if there is no overall exit deal, has become the biggest sticking point in negotiations.
DEAL OR NO DEAL?
May's Northern Irish supporters vehemently oppose any checks between the province and mainland Britain after Brexit.
The head of the Democratic Unionist Party, Arlene Foster, said May ""could not in good conscience"" back an EU proposal for checks on goods being imported to Northern Ireland from Britain after Brexit.
Under May's proposals, the whole of the United Kingdom would forge a customs partnership with the EU after a transition period ends in December 2020 in the event of the backstop being triggered.
Some of May's ministers have urged her to put a time limit on that plan. 
Britain's international trade, environment and Brexit ministers told May at a meeting on Thursday that they fear the whole of Britain could remain in the EU customs union for an open-ended period, the BBC said.
May will never agree to a backstop plan that means Britain could be permanently tied to the bloc's customs rules, her spokeswoman said on Friday. ""The prime minister would never agree to a deal which could trap the UK in a backstop permanently,"" she said.
The Times newspaper reported May was warned the issue was so serious that she could face further cabinet resignations unless she found a way to ensure the backstop was not permanent. 
Speaking to Northern Ireland journalists at her Downing Street office, May said on Thursday that talks on the Irish backstop were likely to continue until November.
In the worse case scenario of Britain failing to agree a divorce deal, the government warned that the single electricity market shared between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic may not continue. Consumers may also no longer enjoy the protections they are used to when buying goods and services in the EU, it added.
However, the government said it was working hard to mitigate such risks.
Britain will continue to enforce EU economic sanctions in force when it leaves the bloc on March 29, even if it does not secure an exit deal.

Brexit supporters accept there is likely to be some short-term economic pain but say the government is trying to scare voters about the impact of a no-deal exit.

226,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",IMF Says Yuan Is Fairly Valued Ahead of U.S. Currency Manipulation Report,"(Bloomberg) -- The yuan is “broadly in line” with China’s economic fundamentals, a senior IMF official said, days before the U.S. Treasury Department is scheduled to release a closely watched report on currency manipulation.
China’s currency has fallen more than 6 percent this year against the dollar, prompting speculation it may fall through the key level of 7 per dollar. The decline has attracted the notice of the U.S., which is locked in a tit-for-tat tariff dispute with Beijing. In an interview Thursday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. wants to make sure the depreciation isn’t a “competitive devaluation.”
The IMF says the drop in the yuan reflects the People’s Bank of China’s commitment to make the exchange rate more flexible.
“According to our framework, the exchange rate of the renminbi is not out of line. It is broadly in line with the fundamentals,” Markus Rodlauer, deputy director of the fund’s Asia and Pacific Department, said in an interview Friday at the IMF annual meetings in Bali, Indonesia, using the official name for the currency.
No Manipulation
The IMF’s view is a key benchmark as trade tensions between the U.S. and China leak into the currency realm. Treasury Department staff don’t believe there’s ground to label China a currency manipulator in the department’s semi-annual foreign-exchange report, two people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News.
It’s possible Mnuchin could revise the final report before it’s released. If the U.S. did name China a manipulator, Mnuchin would have to either enter direct talks with Beijing or conduct negotiations through the IMF.
Mnuchin, speaking in an interview with CNBC TV from Bali on Friday, said currency issues are an element of the trade talks with China. Mnuchin met PBOC Governor Yi Gang this week at the IMF meetings.
Rodlauer declined to comment on the future value of the yuan. But he said the PBOC is allowing the exchange rate to respond to “market pressures,” without allowing big “destabilizing” movements.
Three or four years ago, China wouldn’t have let the currency move as much as it has this year, Rodlauer said. “It is more flexibility. Where the limits of that flexibility are in the short run to prevent this from becoming destabilizing, that is the PBOC’s judgment.""
FX Management
In April, the Treasury department declined to name any major trading partner a manipulator, though it kept China on a watch list of countries to monitor.
Should Mnuchin choose to follow his staff’s advice about the yuan, he may face push-back within the White House. President Donald Trump has tweeted that he thinks China is manipulating its currency -- including days after the last Treasury report in April.
The U.S. hasn’t declared another country a currency manipulator since 1994, when it put China in that category.

The lira  was trading at 5.8975 to the dollar at 1043 GMT, slightly firmer than Thursday's close. Earlier on Friday, it firmed to 5.85 - its strongest level in two months - before reversing course.
It gained 3 percent on Thursday on expectations that the pastor, Andrew Brunson, will be returned to the United States after Friday's court hearing.
""If he is released, it would be a major positive signal for the lira and should prove sufficient for USD/TRY to convincingly break below the support area around 6.00 towards the 5.6968 level,"" Piotr Matys of Rabobank said in a note to clients.
The case of Brunson, an evangelical Christian from North Carolina, has deepened tensions between the NATO allies, helping to send the Turkish currency down 40 percent this year. He faces terrorism charges, which he denies.
NBC News reported that the White House expected Brunson to be released by Turkey and returned to the United States in the coming days, according to two senior administration officials and another person briefed on the matter.
NBC cited its sources as saying that under an agreement which U.S. administration officials recently reached with Turkey, Brunson is supposed to be released after certain charges against him are dropped at Friday's hearing.
The report could not be confirmed.
Brunson's lawyer told Reuters earlier that new prosecution witnesses expected to testify on Friday in his trial lacked relevance as their testimony will focus on incidents after his arrest. 
Istanbul's main stock index (XU100) was up 0.41 percent, with shares in state lender Halkbank (IS:HALKB) rising 3.3 percent, having briefly dropped 6.2 percent before a temporary suspension in trading.
A U.S. judge sentenced Halkbank executive Mehmet Hakan Atilla in May to 32 months in jail after he was convicted of taking part in a scheme to help Iran evade U.S. sanctions. The case is another source of Turkish-U.S. strains. 
Turkey has dismissed the case as politically motivated and its finance minister has said he does not expect Halkbank to face any fine in relation to dealings with Iran.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar crept up on Friday, reflecting investor confidence in the U.S. economy, despite criticism by President Donald Trump of the Federal Reserve and a sell-off in U.S. equities. 
The decline in stocks has yet to spread into foreign exchange markets, with emerging market currencies still appreciating and the safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc not budging significantly.
Concern about a trade war between the United States and China and expectations interest rates will rise further in coming months have underpinned the dollar's 2.5 percent rise since July. 
But a drop in U.S. Treasury bond yields and weaker-than-forecast rise in U.S. consumer prices saw the dollar shed half a percent on Thursday as traders cut their bets on Federal Reserve rate hikes.
Hedge fund have staked out their longest dollar positions since the end of 2016 and markets are focused on any tweak in data that could alter the Fed's thinking.
The dollar index (DXY), a gauge of its value against six major currencies, traded flat at 95 on Friday, down from its monthly high of 96.15 on Tuesday.
""We doubt the dollar will derive much further cyclical support through the remainder of the year. Political uncertainty could also undermine the dollar ahead of the mid-term elections on 6 November,"" said Derek Halpenny, European head of Global Markets Research at MUFG.
""The longer-term negative structural implications of the growing U.S. twin deficits will increasingly weigh on U.S. dollar sentiment,"" he added.
Other analysts see few signs the dollar will fall further. Fed officials said last month they expected three rate hikes in 2019.
""If the equity markets were to calm down again quickly without developments spreading to other asset markets, there is no reason in our mind why the Fed should not continue its rate hikes as planned,"" said Esther Maria Reichelt, an FX strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.
""The dollar will be able to maintain its current strong levels for now but further appreciation potential is limited,"" she said.
The euro (EUR=EBS) was the main beneficiary of dollar weakness on Friday, reaching a weekly high at 1.1611 after minutes of the last European Central Bank meeting set a positive tone.
The minutes suggested the ECB was on track to normalize its ultra-loose monetary policy this year despite concern about slowing growth in Europe. 
""We've heard quite a bit of comment from euro zone policymakers recently about rising inflation and the message is consistent, which is that price pressures are growing,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management.
The Japanese yen , a preferred currency in times of market turbulence, traded at 112.34 on Friday. It had strengthened to 111.83 versus the dollar on Thursday, its highest since Sept. 18.

The Australian dollar was at $0.7122, recovering from Monday's two-year low of $0.7039. The rally was aided by promising news out of China, its biggest trade partner.

While not a directional driver, the data also showed China's unwrought copper imports rose to 521,000 tonnes in September. Meanwhile, iron ore imports increased 4.2% to a four-month high of 93.08 million tonnes in September.

The yen barely shifted on Thursday following the biggest equities slump since February, while the Swiss franc actually fell. The reaction in the haven currencies shows this isn’t a panic, but rather a long overdue reversal in the rally in stocks. U.S. Treasuries also slipped, though any flight to safety there could spill over to currencies, according to  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV.
“We saw something similar in February where the spillover into currency markets from a equity-specific sell-off was limited,” said Viraj Patel, a currency strategist at ING. “If this is just ‘deja vu’ when it comes to the equity market sell-off and VIX spike, then it’s just an equity market correction that has a small and trivial spillover into FX and bonds.”
The yen was little changed at 112.24 versus the dollar by 12:30 p.m. in London, while the Swiss franc was down 0.2 percent at 1.1434 per euro. U.S. Treasuries, which rallied on Wednesday, fell back with the 10-year yield up 2 basis points at 3.18 percent.
The Cboe Volatility Index or VIX, Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” spiked to its highest since April on Thursday. While it’s still well away from a peak seen in February, the speed of the climb did catch the currency market’s attention.
Treasury Focus
Patel is watching haven bonds, as a continued stock stock sell-off that pushes yields down by 10 to 20 basis points could trigger a move in currency markets and see the yen appreciate to 110 to the dollar, he predicts. That would be the strongest level for the Japanese currency since Aug. 21.
Until recently any market uncertainty has provided support for the dollar and traditional beneficiaries of risk-off sentiment haven’t been getting the usual traction, said Jeremy Stretch, head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
“The longer term presumptions of risk-off tendencies benefiting the Swissie and the yen are going to come back into play,” Stretch said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro steadied near $1.15 and away from seven-week lows on Wednesday as a fall in U.S. Treasury yields took some steam out of the dollar's recent run.
Rising Treasury yields and concern about the sustainability of Italy's public finances after the ruling parties proposed a budget criticized by the European Union and have fueled another rally in the dollar in recent sessions, sending the greenback to a 1 1/2-month high on Tuesday.
That rally paused in European trading on Wednesday, although analysts said it was likely to prove a temporary reprieve for the euro.
Investors are betting that rising inflation pressures will keep the Federal Reserve, which unlike the European Central Bank is hiking rates, firmly focused on tighter policy, even as U.S. President Donald Trump took aim at policy makers' hawkish inclinations.
""If U.S. yields rise at the same time and the market prices in a slightly more aggressive Fed next year, that automatically means that EUR/USD will head south,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Antje Praefcke.
""That means that short-term the dollar will continue to remain bid. The euro has lost its shine and therefore has too little to offer at present.""
On Wednesday, the dollar index (DXY) was largely unchanged at 95.692, not far off 96.163 reached during the previous session -- its highest level since Aug. 20.

Yields on Italy's 10-year bonds have hit a 4 1/2-year high this week - reflecting concern about the country's finances - despite encouraging comments from Italian Economy Minister Giovanni Tria.
Tria said that Italy will do whatever is necessary to restore calm if market turbulence turns into a financial crisis, adding fears over the country's budget plan for next year were unjustified.

The move reflected improved liquidity conditions, taking into account private sector deposit flows and banks' access to financial markets, it said. The ELA ceiling is valid through to Nov 7.
Greek banks have relied on emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) since February 2015 after being cut off from the ECB's funding window. Emergency funding is more costly than borrowing directly from the ECB.
In June 2016 the ECB reinstated Greek banks' access to its cheap funding operations, allowing lenders to reduce their dependence on the emergency liquidity lifeline.

But with Athens out of its bailout program since August 21 this year, the ECB has ended a waiver that made Greek government bonds eligible collateral for its cheap funding.

The fund said in its updated World Economic Outlook that it was now predicting a 3.7% growth, down from the 3.9% growth it forecasted in July. It was the first downgrade since July 2016. 
Crude Oil WTI Futures for November delivery slipped 0.2% to $74.74 a barrel by 1:45AM ET (05:45 GMT) on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while London’s Intercontinental Exchange showed that Brent Oil Futures for December delivery also traded 0.1% lower to $84.89 per barrel.
Oil prices gained in the previous session on worries of a hurricane swirling toward the oil-rich U.S. Gulf Coast.
Companies operating in the Gulf shut down nearly 20% of their oil production as Hurricane Michael approached the region, where it was expected to make landfall on Wednesday as a Category 3 storm.
According to forecasts by various weather services, Michael could deliver the most powerful strike in at least a decade on the Panhandle, a 200-mile strip on northwest Florida that’s home to the state’s largest crude and natural gas fields.

Only this time, the declines might not be triggered by oil but by the surprise move by India’s central bank to hold rates despite the currency’s free fall.
The rupee, which has fallen for six straight months in the longest stretch since 2002, is seen sliding to 75 per dollar by year-end, according to median of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The December-end estimate has inched up from 69 at the start of September.
Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel’s comments Friday that the rupee’s drop is moderate in comparison to emerging market peers and that the central bank doesn’t have any target in mind unnerved investors who were expecting the authority to boost its defense of Asia’s worst-performing major currency.
“Governor Patel has effectively left the rupee out in the cold and insinuated that it is not his job to determine the appropriate level for the currency,” said Charlie Lay, an analyst at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) in Singapore. “RBI has seemingly opened the floodgates for further rupee weakness.”
The rupee fell past the 74 to a dollar mark for the first time soon after the RBI’s decision, and analysts, whose year-end estimates have been obliterated by the meltdown, cut their targets further. Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB said the rupee could test 75 in the near term while ING Bank NV said the bank’s recent downgrade to 75 wasn’t enough.
The currency rose 0.2 percent to 74.2275 at 10:22 a.m. in Mumbai, rebounding from a record low of 74.3950 touched on Tuesday.
To be sure, the RBI has for long maintained that it steps in only to curb undue volatility and doesn’t target any currency level. That stance places the authority behind counterparts in Indonesia and the Philippines, which have been actively supporting their currencies, Madhavi Arora, an economist at Edelweiss Securities Ltd., wrote in a note Tuesday.
“We expect the weakness to persist, with the rupee heading toward 75-plus levels against the dollar, unless some additional assertive policy steps come through,” she said.

Lu said at a regular news briefing that recent accusations by U.S. officials that China had been intentionally weakening the currency to help exporters were “groundless speculation and irresponsible.”
Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that a senior U.S. treasury official expressed concern at the fall in the yuan and that Washington was considering naming China as a “currency manipulator” in a report due next week.
The USD/CNY pair slipped 0.03% at 6.9304 by 12:30AM ET (04:30 GMT) as the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the yuan reference rate at 6.9072 vs the previous day's fix of 6.9019.
Elsewhere, a Reuters poll showed that the yuan could potentially pare some of its recent losses in 2019 as traders expected trade tensions with the U.S. and sell-off in emerging markets would eventually subside.
The poll of over 50 foreign exchange strategists suggested that the Chinese currency would trade at 6.80 per dollar in 2019.
""The most likely scenario for a strong CNY rebound against USD is for risk-on sentiment to resume again. This will likely only come when the negativity from U.S.-China tensions and EM risks fades,"" said Jeff Ng, Asia chief economist at Continuum Economics.
""We believe that the most likely trigger would be a resolution of U.S.-China trade talks, given the unpredictable nature of U.S. President Donald Trump. Other possible triggers could also stem from a stronger trade relationship between China and Europe or investors finally finding another positive reason to put risk on the table again.""

U.S. President Donald Trump, in a statement, said that the tariffs would rise to 25% in January 2019, adding that ""if China takes retaliatory action against our farmers or other industries, we will immediately pursue phase three, which is tariffs on approximately $267 billion of additional imports."" 
In the same week, Beijing announced retaliatory tariffs that targeted more than 5,000 U.S. products worth $60 billion. The new tariffs would take effect on Sep 24, China’s Ministry of Finance said in a statement.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - China's yuan is forecast to pare some of its recent losses against the dollar over the coming year on hopes that risks from an escalating U.S.-China trade war and a deep sell-off in emerging markets will subside, a Reuters poll found.
Having weakened over 6 percent so far this year, the yuan hit a 7-week low on Monday after the People's Bank of China (PBOC) loosened policy by cutting the ratio of cash that banks must hold as reserves.
The PBOC's decision was its latest move to try and bolster an economy that is feeling the heat of a tit-for-tat tariff dispute with the United States. 
While most strategists left their currency predictions unchanged after the PBOC cut reserve requirements, the latest 12-month yuan view was the most pessimistic forecast in Reuters polls since October last year.
The yuan  was expected to gain around 1.7 percent to 6.80 per dollar in a year's time from around 6.92 currently, according to the poll of over 50 foreign exchange strategists.
Sixteen strategists see the yuan weakening to 7 to the dollar or higher at some point over the 12-month period, the highest number of respondents in the Reuters poll predicting that since August 2017.
""The most likely scenario for a strong CNY rebound against USD is for risk-on sentiment to resume again. This will likely only come when the negativity from U.S.-China tensions and EM risks fades,"" said Jeff Ng, Asia chief economist at Continuum Economics.
""We believe that the most likely trigger would be a resolution of U.S.-China trade talks, given the unpredictable nature of U.S. President Donald Trump. Other possible triggers could also stem from a stronger trade relationship between China and Europe or investors finally finding another positive reason to put risk on the table again.""
Trump imposed tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports last month, in addition to duties on $50 billion of goods previously announced. China has retaliated and plans for new trade talks between Beijing and Washington recently collapsed.
That bitter trade dispute between the two world's biggest economies pushed the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to lower its China's 2019 economic growth forecast to 6.2 percent from 6.4 percent.
But most currency strategists remained optimistic on the yuan's outlook for the coming year on hopes some trade negotiations will be initiated between Washington and Beijing. Those expectations are also dependent on a fading in the dollar's safe-haven appeal. [EUR/POLL]
According to a wider Reuters foreign exchange poll, the U.S. dollar rally, which has had its best run so far this year since 2015, will last only another three to six months.
""We expect the dollar rally to lose steam. We believe that the yuan is significantly oversold as indicated by all technical indicators,"" said Amy Yuan Zhuang, chief Asia analyst at Nordea.
""In a year's time, the market will likely realize that the trade war has hurt the Chinese economy less than expected and the sentiment on China will improve from the current level.""
But not all currency strategists expect the yuan to appreciate over the coming 12-months.
Nearly half - 18 of 37 common contributors in the latest survey and a September poll - revised forecasts to a weaker yuan, citing expectations for more policy easing from China's central bank in coming months. 
Eight respondents revised their forecast to reflect a stronger currency, while the remaining 11 left projections unchanged.
""The risk of further Chinese yuan depreciation comes not so much from the tariff war turning into a currency war, but more from Beijing's policy responses to cushion the economy,"" Philip Wee, an FX strategist at DBS Bank, wrote in a note.

249,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>","Argentine peso extends rally, worries grow about central bank debt","By Gabriel Burin
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's currency extended its week-long rally on Tuesday as investors swarmed toward peso-denominated debt offered by the central bank at nose-bleed high interest rates, even as economists worried over the bank's growing indebtedness.
The central bank began offering short-term notes called ""Leliqs"" with interest rates of about 70 percent at the start of the month to encourage Argentine banks to invest in peso- denominated assets rather than seeking the safety of the U.S. dollar. The strong dollar has fueled soaring inflation in Latin America's third biggest economy. 
It traded at 37.2 pesos to the greenback on Tuesday. The peso  has risen 11.2 percent so far in October, including Tuesday's gain of more than 1 percent. But it is still down more than 50 percent against the dollar since the start of the year, with private economists forecasting further peso devaluation ahead.
Economists, however, were concerned over the high rates carried by the notes and see the issuance of the new Leliqs as a risky maneuver that could backfire and saddle the bank with too much debt.
With every fresh sale of Leliqs, the bank's liabilities grow. The strategy still may prove successful if the expected depreciation of the peso over the year ahead increases the value of the bank's dollar reserves.
Guido Lorenzo, an economist at local consultancy ACM, said the danger was the central bank's rate of indebtedness outpacing the rate at which its dollar reserves are depreciating.
    ""If this happens the central bank is going to end up with some terribly high debt obligations,"" Lorenzo said.
The peso sell-off started in May, when foreign investors grew concerned about Argentina's ability to pay its debts and dumped what had been a rapidly growing inventory of short-term central bank notes called ""Lebacs.""
The Leliqs are offered only to local financial institutions, which are subject to reserve requirements that would block them from rushing out of the short-term notes and causing a fresh run on the peso.
The central bank sold 82.996 billion pesos ($2.2 billion) in Leliqs at an average annual interest rate of 73.524 percent on Monday with more expected to be issued on Tuesday.
The currency is seen plummeting about 19 percent to 47 to the dollar over the next 12 months, according to a poll of economists by Reuters last week. The bank says it will keep interest rates above 60 percent until December. 

The International Monetary Fund has cut its global economic growth forecast for this year and next, citing factors including capital outflows and tighter financial conditions in emerging markets like Argentina.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro languished near a seven-week low on Tuesday as concerns about a row in the European Union over Italy's budget persisted.
The euro has tended not to budge in response to spikes in Italian bond yields triggered by developments in the dispute, with investors judging that Rome's spending plans will not impact the monetary policy of the European Central Bank.
But the threat of a showdown along with weakness in stock markets worldwide has seen traders who had bet on a fourth quarter euro rebound ditch the single currency.

Ten-year Treasury yields resumed their steep climb to seven-year highs on Tuesday. That helped the dollar strengthen across the board with only Japan's yen outperforming among the major currencies.

India Inc. overall is better off than several years ago, after more companies with foreign-currency debt bought protection against rupee declines, which otherwise would push up the cost to service those obligations. But there’s still a group of debtors that lack such safeguards, just as the rupee’s tumble worsens and a wall of debt comes due.
As the rupee slides to fresh lows and U.S. rates move sharply higher, unhedged Indian firms that swapped overseas debt into the local currency and that don’t have foreign-currency revenues face sharply higher repayment costs. The plight of such borrowers stands out after many peers boosted hedges in recent years. As much as 75 percent of the external commercial borrowings of Indian companies are now hedged, according to Samir Lodha, managing director and forex hedging strategist at QuantArt Market Solutions.
Indian companies went on a borrowing spree abroad in the past few years, when the local currency was stronger. The rupee has lost more than 13 percent this year and touched fresh lows against the dollar, making it the worst performer among major Asian currencies, amid a selloff in emerging-market assets.
While hedging has become more common, there is still a lot of foreign debt out there. Indian firms, both hedged and unhedged, face $28 billion of non-rupee bonds and loans coming due in 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That level is similar to elevated figures in recent years, when borrowing costs were lower.
“Many Indian companies are not fully hedged due to high costs for covering exchange risk or a natural hedge,” said Abhishek Dangra, a Singapore-based analyst at S&P Global Ratings. “Some of these companies may see higher refinancing risks.”

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has faced pressure from the White House to formally designate China a currency manipulator in the report. The yuan has tumbled 9 percent against the dollar in the last six months in one of Asia’s worst performances, raising speculation that China has been deliberately weakening its currency as trade tensions with the U.S. have escalated.

269,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 11:20PM ET</span>","Analysts keep touching faith in the Australian, NZ dollars: Reuters poll","By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Foreign exchange analysts have trimmed near-term forecasts for the Australian and New Zealand dollars, but stayed upbeat on the long-term outlook despite the beating the two currencies have taken in recent weeks.
A Reuters survey of 55 analysts saw median predictions for the Aussie cut to $0.7200 on a one-month horizon, from $0.7275 in the previous poll. 
Yet projections for three, six and 12 months remained doggedly unchanged at $0.7300, $0.7400 and $0.7500 respectively.
Such faith seemed surprising, given the Aussie has shed almost two cents since early September to hit 32-month lows at $0.7066.
The trade-exposed currency has been used by investors to wager on, or hedge against, tensions in emerging markets and the risks to the Chinese economy from U.S. tariffs.
A sudden surge in U.S. bond yields and hawkish commentary from the Federal Reserve has also driven the U.S. dollar higher more broadly. In contrast, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has repeatedly stated that its rates will remain at historic lows for some time to come.
""We see AUD/USD as a '70-75 cents currency' for a good while to come, but with risk now skewed toward spending at least some time sub-$0.70 in the next six months or so if emerging market pressures do intensify significantly,"" says NAB's head of FX strategy Ray Attrill.
Only a handful of analysts in the Reuters poll forecast a fall under $0.7000 and the lowest call was for $0.6700 in three months, suggesting relatively limited downside.
Attrill argued that further out, the U.S. dollar would come under pressure of its own from the United States' expanding budget and trade deficits.
""Successful efforts by China to offset much of the growth drag from weaker exports via policy stimulus would also help AUD,"" he added.
For the kiwi, analysts again cut their forecasts by a cent or so, but the predictions still trailed the markets by some way. The currency was last trading at $0.6481, compared to the $0.6700 seen in the previous poll.
Expectations were now for $0.6600 in one and three months, with $0.6700 and $0.6800 pencilled in for six and 12 months respectively.
The downside risk was perceived as greater, though, with forecasts stretching as low at $0.6009 on a six-month view.
""We remain bearish, targeting $0.6400 or lower by year-end,"" said Westpac's head of NZ market strategy Imre Speizer.
""The main factor is an expectation the U.S. dollar will rise further as the Fed raises rates further and U.S. economic growth remains strong,"" he added. ""The yield spread between U.S. and NZ should move further in the USD's favor.""
Yields on 10-year Treasury debt are currently 57 basis points above those in New Zealand, near the widest in history.

The currency is then expected to climb to C$1.2500 in a year, stronger than the C$1.2600 forecast in September's poll.
""We are looking for the Canadian dollar to strengthen over the next 12 months,"" said Eric Theoret, a currency strategist at Scotiabank.
Removing the threat of tariffs on autos clears ""a huge cloud of uncertainty"" for the economy and could give businesses the confidence to invest in new assets, Theoret said.
U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Canadian autos if a trade deal was not reached. The Bank of Canada forecast in July that trade uncertainty could subtract about two-thirds of a percent from gross domestic product by the end of 2020.
With the trade deal clinched, investors have raised bets for as many as four additional interest rate increases from the Bank of Canada by the end of 2019.
""We now have the Bank of Canada hiking four times over the next 12 months, which will definitively put Canadian rates above everyone else except for the U.S.,"" said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York. ""What that tends to do is attract capital into Canada.""
Foreign investment could also flow to Canada if the country resolve difficulties it faces in expanding the Trans Mountain oil pipeline, Anderson said.
Canada will not appeal a court ruling that overturned its approval of the pipeline project, opting instead for more consultations with aboriginal groups unhappy about the plan, a top official said on Wednesday.
The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, climbed on Wednesday to its highest since November 2014.
A larger-than-usual discount for Canada's heavy crude has reduced some benefit for Canada of higher oil prices.
Western Canada Select (WCS) oil traded on Tuesday for $42 per barrel less than West Texas Intermediate light oil, near its biggest differential in data going back to 2010, according to Shorcan Energy Brokers.
But Scotiabank expects the discount to narrow over the next one to two years and for the U.S. dollar to weaken, boosting commodity prices.

""Canada will get to benefit on the back of an improvement in our terms of trade,"" Theoret said.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was at 95.57 by 03:43 AM ET (07:43 AM GMT) after hitting an overnight high of 95.78, the most since August 20.
Data on Wednesday showed that U.S. service sector activity accelerated to a 21-year high in September and another report showed that private sector hiring increased at the fastest pace in seven months in September.
Adding to the upbeat mood, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the U.S. central bank may raise interest rates above an estimated ""neutral"" setting as the U.S. economy continues to grow.
“Interest rates are still accommodative, but we’re gradually moving to a place where they’ll be neutral,” neither holding back nor spurring economic growth, Powell said. “We may go past neutral. But we’re a long way from neutral at this point, probably,” he added.
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose to seven year highs overnight as the strong economic data and hawkish comments bolstered expectations for the Fed to raise interest rates again in December and beyond.
The euro was trading at one-and-a-half month lows against the dollar, with EUR/USD at 1.1477 after falling 0.61% on Wednesday.
The euro had initially risen Wednesday, as reports that Italy plans to cut its budget deficit after next year eased concerns over the prospect of a wider deficit that had rattled markets, before reversing those gains.

273,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>",Worst Emerging Market Currency Nears Bottom for This Treasurer,"(Bloomberg) -- The past month’s worst performing emerging market currency is nearing a bottom, according to the head of global treasury at Asia’s largest software exporter Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.
The Indian rupee has dropped 2.9 percent over a month, the biggest slump among 24 emerging markets tracked by Bloomberg. It fell past 73 per dollar to a fresh record this week. The currency won’t drop much further with the Reserve Bank of India and government taking “adequate measures” to arrest declines, T Venkatesan, TCS’s global treasury head, said in an interview at his office in Mumbai.
“I don’t see rupee breaching 74 against dollar. That should be the cap,” Venkatesan said. “We are already close to the top of this move.”
India’s currency has declined for six straight months, prompting analysts at banks such as  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc. and Mizuho Bank Ltd. to predict a weakening past 74 per dollar by the end of the year. Weighing on the rupee are ever-higher oil prices and a current account deficit that makes India dependent on foreign inflows. Measures by the central bank and government -- including raising import tariffs and easing some overseas borrowing norms -- have as yet failed to revive the confidence of investors.
Given concerns around inflation and the currency, the central bank will probably raise interest rates 25 basis points on Friday, adding to two increases this year, according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey.
India’s rate-setting panel will deliver at least two hikes in benchmark borrowing rates this year, estimated Venkatesan in the interview, adding that his views on the currency and rates were his own and not TCS’s. “If the Fed hikes, we should see another two hikes next year,” he said.
TCS is a large investor in India’s bond markets with a little more than half of its 477 billion rupees ($6.5 billion) in cash reserves invested in government securities as of March 31, according to its annual report. The rest is spread over deposits, mutual funds and corporate debt.
On the currency side, the company hedges its exposures for about two to three quarters ahead, Venkatesan said. “While in the short-run there are always pitfalls. But in the long-run, hedging is going to make you gain only.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar hit an 11-month high against the yen and stood tall against other its peers on Thursday, boosted by a spike in Treasury yields following upbeat U.S. data and comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that were seen as hawkish.
The dollar stretched an overnight rally to touch 114.55 yen , its highest since early November 2017. It last stood at 114.345. A rise above 114.735 yen would take the U.S. currency to its highest level since mid-March 2017.
Adding to the bullish mood, Powell said on Wednesday that the central bank may raise interest rates above an estimated ""neutral"" setting as the ""remarkably positive"" U.S. economy continues to grow.
The dollar also was boosted after the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) non-manufacturing activity index jumped 3.1 points to 61.6 last month, the highest reading since August 1997. 
The ADP National Employment Report also showed private payrolls jumped by 230,000 jobs in September, the largest gain since February.

276,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 08:20PM ET</span>",Euro weakness to be limited; dollar to be dethroned next year: Reuters poll,"By Hari Kishan
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The euro will withstand the latest political turmoil in Italy and any short-term spill will be limited, but it may be another six months before the dominant dollar trade is swept aside, according to a Reuters poll of currency strategists.
After its best run since 2003 last year, the single currency is down close to 4 percent so far in 2018, driven mainly by increasing bets in favor of the dollar on solid U.S. economic performance and the Federal Reserve's policy tightening path.
Markets recently have been unnerved by the uncertainty surrounding Italy's debt pile, fiscal plans and future ties with Europe, which pushed the single currency to a six-week low of $1.1504 against the dollar on Tuesday.
But the latest poll of over 70 strategists taken Sept 28-Oct 3 forecast the euro (EUR=) to trade higher at $1.16 in three months from around $1.15 on Wednesday. It was then expected to rise to $1.22 in a year, about a six percent rise from here.
""We feel that a lot of bad news is already priced into Italian assets - including a Moody's downgrade - and hence see the balance of risks tilted toward the euro moving higher from here as some of the markets' worst fears are shelved,"" noted Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING in London.
The single currency is expected to fall at most by only one percent to a low of $1.14 at some point over the next three months, according to the median of 30 strategists who answered an additional question. But that would still be comfortably above a 13-month low of $1.1297 hit in August.
""For the euro to move well below $1.1500 and back down toward the previous lows...we would really need to see the Italian debt situation escalate significantly from here and challenge the sustainability of the euro zone and euro going forward,"" said Lee Hardman, currency strategist at MUFG.
""That is not our base case scenario. But obviously if we reach that kind of a crisis scenario, all bets are off, because it will be going a lot lower.""
LESS BACKING FOR GREENBACK IN 2019
While currency speculators increased their bets in favor of the dollar for the second week in a row, strategists in the latest Reuters poll were almost evenly split on whether the greenback's rally has already stalled.
A majority of strategists who answered a separate question said the U.S. dollar's dominance will last only another three months or six most.
With several of the factors that have helped the dollar rally expected to fade soon, most major currencies are forecast to gain in a year.

""It might run up a little bit further for a couple of months on the emerging markets side, but the dollar versus major currencies is starting to peak,"" said Gavin Friend, senior markets strategist at NAB.
""Markets are getting more interested in the end of the U.S. (tightening) cycle, which has been almost fully priced in.""
Against the dollar, sterling was forecast to strengthen by the time Britain leaves the European Union. But over the coming year it was not expected to regain its losses since the shock Brexit vote in 2016. [GBP/POLL]
""Our basic assumption is that we think the EU and the UK will eventually reach a Brexit deal. At this stage, it is still highly uncertain how they get to that kind of end-point of a deal. The pound could yet weaken further before a deal is reached,"" added Hardman.

""But we still think that overall, a deal is more likely as both sides want to avoid a no-deal scenario. That should result in the pound strengthening notably.""

279,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 01:00AM ET</span>",Pound Left Cornered as Brexit Bugbears Multiply Beyond No-Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Suddenly, a no-deal Brexit is just one of the many unknowns pound traders need to contend with.
Now the risk of a second referendum or even that of another U.K. election no longer looks as far-fetched as they did only recently, and need to be taken on board by investors. The biggest worry for investors is still that Britain will crash out of the European Union without an economic agreement, with talks deadlocked and time running out. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg see sterling sliding almost 8 percent to $1.20 on such an outcome.
At its recent annual conference, the opposition Labour Party said it plans to vote down Prime Minister Theresa May’s exit agreement with the EU and push for a fresh national ballot, while seeing a second plebiscite on Brexit as a way of avoiding a chaotic separation from the bloc. Analysts in the Bloomberg survey see a 23 percent probability of a no-deal Brexit, slightly up from 20 percent in a similar poll held in July.
“The Labour party conference has been interesting since they may consider backing a second referendum,” said Jane Foley, head of currency strategy at Rabobank. “This adds more Brexit permutations for the pound but it does increase the chances of” a no-deal situation leading to a second referendum.
The increasing uncertainty is prompting some investors to opt to stay on the sidelines of the market or to trade through options, with volatility becoming more expensive as the Brexit deadline grows closer.
‘Be Nimble’
“Many clients don’t want to be involved,” Rabobank’s Foley said. “Those that have to, I would advise to be nimble.”
Even with multiplying Brexit ambiguities, the pound has gained over the past month. While this was partly due to dollar weakness, some investors see it as a sign that the market is still not fully awake to the risks. Sterling was around $1.2980 Tuesday.
“Over the summer, markets were strangely complacent on Brexit tail risks, both of the chance of no deal or the chance of a soft Brexit,” said Michael Riddell, a U.K. portfolio manager at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors, who is opting for out-of-the-money call options to profit from a large, little-expected rally in the pound. “The market still appears a little complacent. The options market is pricing in more risk, but still not enough.”
Volatility Premium
Three-month sterling-dollar implied volatility climbed to 236 basis points over the realized measure last week, the widest premium since the Brexit vote in June 2016 but still well below the extreme levels seen then.
This suggests “a sizable depreciation of sterling in case of a no-deal Brexit that is roughly 10 percent as an initial reaction,” according to Thu Lan Nguyen, a strategist at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG).
At the annual conference of the U.K.’s ruling Conservative Party, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson won cheers with an attack on May’s Brexit plan, but stopped short of calling for her to be removed as prime minister. The prime minister is preparing to make a significant new offer to the EU -- including compromises on the contentious Irish border issue -- in an attempt to open the door to a deal, according to a senior British government official.
“If Theresa May does back down then there’s a high risk of a revolt in her party,” said Riddell. “It looks increasingly likely that the opposition will push for another referendum. In short, it’s a mess.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar stood near a one-month high against its peers on Wednesday as concerns as political wrangling over Italy's budget plan rattled market sentiment and weighed on the euro.
The greenback rose as the euro slumped after a senior Italian lawmaker said most of the country's problems would be solved if it returned to a national currency of its own.
The euro was little changed at $1.1550 (EUR=) in Asian trade after retreating to a six-week low of $1.1505 overnight.
The Italian lawmaker, Claudio Borghi, later back-pedalled on his comments. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte also said the euro was ""unrenouncable.""
Still, that was not enough to prompt a strong bounce for the euro, which has been stung recently by worries over heavily indebted Italy's budget situation.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was steady at 95.468 (DXY) after scaling 95.744 overnight, its highest since Sept. 4 as Italian concerns chilled investor risk sentiment in the broader markets and raised demand for the safe-haven U.S. currency.
The yen, another safe-haven currency, also gained against peers such as the euro, dollar and Australian dollar.
The greenback last stood at 113.62 yen , having pulled back from an 11-month high of 114.06 reached on Monday.
""The slip by European currencies in the wake of the latest Italian concerns has lifted the dollar. But a larger component of the dollar's recent rise comes from fundamental factors fortified after the Fed's rate hike,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
The dollar index has advanced about 1.4 percent since last Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates as expected and said it foresees another rate hike in December, three more next year and one in 2020.
""U.S. data due later today such as the non-manufacturing ISM index and Friday's jobs report will provide a chance to see if the economy is performing in line with the Fed's views,"" Ishikawa said.
The pound was little changed at $1.2981  after dropping on Tuesday to $1.2941, its weakest since Sept. 10, as conflicts over Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan escalated.
The Australian dollar was steady at $0.7189  after sliding the previous day to a two-week trough of $0.7162. The Aussie, sensitive to shifts in global risk sentiment, was hit as equities sold off on worries over Italy. 

In the near term, Australian dollar risks probably remain to the downside, given the confluence of the recent Fed meeting, the U.S. review of China tariffs and Italy budget risks, currency strategists at Westpac wrote.

282,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",Iran clamps down on market in drive to rescue rial from record lows,"By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin and Andrew Torchia
LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's rial rose on Tuesday as authorities in Tehran sold U.S. dollars and clamped down on unofficial foreign exchange trade in a drive to rescue the currency from record lows hit because of U.S. economic sanctions, traders said.
The rial traded at 147,000 to the dollar in the unofficial market, up from 156,500 on Monday and a record low of 190,000 reached last Wednesday, according to foreign exchange website Bonbast.com.
The currency's slide, from levels around 43,000 at the end of last year, has eroded the value of ordinary Iranians' savings, triggering panic buying of dollars.
The rial has been undermined by the prospect of U.S. sanctions after Washington pulled out of an international deal on Tehran's nuclear program. U.S. measures targeting Iran’s oil industry are due to take effect in November.
Traders said on Tuesday that the central bank appeared to have released more dollars into the market in the last several days in an effort to halt the rial's slide, which is disrupting Iran's foreign trade and pushing up inflation.
On Saturday, the government announced the central bank would intervene in the market through banks and authorized exchange shops to control the exchange rate.
Meanwhile, authorities clamped down on Tuesday on websites and social media groups tracking the unofficial foreign exchange market.
Some websites, such as Mesghal, only showed the little-used official rate of 42,000 rials to the dollar, while others such as 2gheroon did not announce any rate for the dollar. A group on the Telegram messaging service, called the Forex and Gold Portal, was suspended; it had around 38,000 members.
Tehran police chief Hossein Rahimi was quoted as saying by state television that police had ""dealt with"" 15 websites that were posting ""wrong"" prices for the dollar.
""The brokers in the market are under police surveillance and they will be severely punished,"" he said.
On Sunday, special courts set up in a campaign against financial crime sentenced three people to death for spreading corruption, a punishment that was seen by some currency traders as a warning against pushing the rial lower.
An International Monetary Fund report in March said Iran was running a current account surplus and had over $100 billion of gross official reserves. These numbers suggested Tehran might have enough financial ammunition to defend its currency.

However, the U.S. sanctions could cut the current account surplus sharply, while the IMF said Tehran was having difficulty accessing some of its reserves because its relations with foreign banks were constrained by the threat of sanctions.

Ireland has consistently beaten its revenue target in recent years, even as it gradually unwinds tax increases introduced during the financial crisis due to a rapid jobs recovery and the benefits of being a major location for multinational companies.
However while corporate tax receipts were 6.3 percent ahead of target at the end of the third quarter, income tax and value-added tax, the two largest tax categories, stood 0.1 percent and 0.3 percent below target. A large 8.0 percent underperformance in excise duty more than wiped out the company tax gains.
The total tax take, however, was still 5.2 percent up year-on-year, the data from the finance department showed on Tuesday, reflecting Ireland's strongly performing economy.
Assuming fiscal targets are met, Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe has a modest 800 million euros to dish out on further tax cuts and spending increases next year, having already committed over 2 billion through previously announced increases in current and capital spending. 
Donohoe is expected to find extra money through measures under consideration including the scrapping or part scrapping of a reduced VAT rate for the tourism sector. 
With expenditure 0.1 percent behind where the government had estimated it to be and up 8.9 percent year-on-year, the exchequer recorded a deficit of 1.47 billion euros for the first nine months of the year.

The government expects to run a deficit of 0.2 percent of economic output this year, although the central bank and independent fiscal watchdog has urged it to be more prudent and target a surplus.

Investor concerns over Italy intensified Tuesday, after the head of the lower house's budget committee said the country would have solved its fiscal problems with its own currency.
The comments added to a war of words with the EU over the populist government’s budget proposal which seeks to increase spending and cut taxes, but would raise Italy's debt and breach EU budget rules.

(Reuters) - The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said on Tuesday it had opened an inquiry into price competition among suppliers of foreign currency conversion services and would investigate the ability of potential entrants to compete. 
The ACCC said the inquiry would examine the ways exchange rates are presented to customers as well as the mark-up from wholesale currency rates that buyers are charged when changing currencies. 
“We will be examining why major companies in Australia, including the Big Four banks, seem to be able to consistently charge high prices,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said. 
“The exchange rate you Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is not the exchange rate you get from the Big Four banks. The difference is known as the ‘mark-up’, and it’s often a big part of the price consumers pay when converting currency,” he added.
A 2017 study by consultancy Capital Economics found Australian consumers and businesses paid out about A$3.9 billion ($2.82 billion) in foreign currency fees in 2016, of which more than A$3.1 billion was in exchange rate mark-ups and card spending charges applied by banks and brokers to international transactions.
A powerful Royal Commission inquiry into Australia's big banks and wealth managers has shined a harsh light on financial institutions in the country, revealing widespread misconduct and deception of customers.
The Australian Banking Association said the inquiry's interim findings marked ""a day of shame for Australia’s banks"" with ""no excuses for the behavior that has been exposed by the Royal Commission"". 
A World Bank report published in June said the cost of sending money overseas from Australia was higher than both the Group of 20 nations and global averages. 
Australia had migrant remittance outflows of about $6.36 billion in 2016, according to the World Bank. 
The ACCC said it will submit its final report to the Treasurer by May 2019.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar retained gains against a basket of currencies on Tuesday while slipping off a more than 10-month peak against the yen as the boost to risk appetites from the U.S.-Canada trade deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement faded.
Traders awaited the outcome of a Reserve Bank of Australia monetary policy meeting. The RBA is expected to stretch its record spell of rates at 1.5 percent well into next year, according to a Reuters poll, with a 25 basis-point hike not expected before end-2019.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six peers, edged higher to 95.322, trading near a three-week high of 95.373 reached the previous session.
While fears about international trade conflicts between the United States and major trading partners including China have lifted the dollar 3.4 percent this year, an increasingly confident U.S. Federal Reserve has also boosted the greenback.
The newly minted United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, announced on Sunday, preserves a $1.2 trillion open-trade zone that was on the brink of collapse after nearly a quarter century.
Ayako Sera, market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, said the U.S trade representative ""was occupied solving the problem in relation to NAFTA up until now"". 
""Japan and the United States can really kick off their trade negotiations now that has ended,"" she said.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed on Sept. 27 to start fresh trade talks.
Against the Japanese yen , the dollar rose 0.06 percent to 113.92 yen on Tuesday. 
Following the U.S.-Canada trade deal, the yen fell as low as 114.06 per dollar, its weakest since November 2017.
The greenback is now up just over 1 percent against the yen this year. It strengthened 2.3 percent against the Japanese currency in September. 
""If we close this week above 114, that's going to be a significant milestone,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo branch manager at State Street Bank.
The Australian dollar , meanwhile, was 0.05 percent higher at $0.7228 shortly before the RBA's policy decision.
Elsewhere, the Canadian  traded at C$1.2804 per dollar, holding onto most of its 0.7 percent gains the previous day.
The euro (EUR=) was down 0.06 percent against the greenback at $1.1573 on renewed concerns about Italy's budget deficit.
Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio accused European Union officials of deliberately upsetting financial markets with negative comments about Italy's budget plans.

He was taking aim at European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici, who earlier said that Rome's plans were ""obviously"" deviating from EU rules on fiscal discipline.

The USD/JPY pair gained 0.03% to 113.95 by 11:30AM ET (03:30 GMT). The Japanese currency was reportedly weighed down by improved market sentiment following the NAFTA announcement.
The yen is now near its lowest in more than 10 months against the dollar.
""Overall, I do think the yen is acting as a proxy to risk...115 will definitely be a level that I don't think will be so easy to break through,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo branch manager at State Street Bank.

The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, inched up 0.04% to 94.96.
The gain in dollar came after the US and Canada reached a new trade deal, along with Mexico, to replace the NAFTA.
“It is a great deal for all three countries,” Trump wrote on Twitter Monday. He added that the new deal could solve the many “deficiencies and mistakes in NAFTA, greatly opens markets to our Farmers and Manufacturers, reduce Trade Barriers to the U.S. and will bring all three Great Nations closer together in competition with the rest of the world.”
U.S. President Donald Trump will hold a news conference on the new trade deal later in the day in Washington.

GBP/USD jumped 0.28% to 1.3066 as of 9:05 AM ET (13:05 GMT), not far from an earlier high of 1.3078.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May plans to make a new Brexit deal with the European Union, Bloomberg reported. A senior British government official told Bloomberg that the country sees a way to reach an agreement on the border issue.
The compromise would only apply as a last resort if a deal is not reached and would be conditional on the UK having full access to the EU customs union. The EU has already proposed allowing Northern Ireland to trade with Ireland without full checks, which May has rejected on the grounds that it would break up the UK.

The group said it was the first non-U.S. financial services infrastructure to connect to the Fed's National Settlement Service. While Euroclear UK and Ireland (EUI) already offers settlement in ""central bank money"" for sterling and euro transactions, hooking up with the Fed allows it to expand the service to dollars.
Central bank or sovereign money refers to money issued by a central bank. EUI's existing dollar settlement was based on commercial bank money, which is generated when banks issue loans or conduct transactions in excess of their actual currency holdings.
Euroclear said customers would now get dollar cash proceeds from a sale of securities from the moment each transaction settled. Banks would be protected from possible risks stemming from another settlement bank's failure to pay.
The ability of settlement banks to make payments in the Fed's accounts would be underpinned by funds they hold with the Bank of England, the group said.
Ian Dowglass, EUI's head of innovation and business transformation, said there had been big client demand for the service in dollars. It has offered settlement in central bank money for sterling since 2001 and settles an average 425 billion pounds worth of sterling transactions per day. 
Dollar transactions, on the other hand, were between $2 billion and $5 billion a day.
""It's all part of risk reduction. What clients now get is absolute central bank settlement in all securities transactions in three currencies,"" Dowglass told Reuters. ""There is no longer a layer of commercial bank risk.""
Worldwide, the Euroclear group settled the equivalent of 733 trillion euros in securities transactions last year, via a total 215 million transactions and it held 28.6 trillion euros in assets for clients.

The exchange rate touched its strongest level since mid-August and tested a key psychological level against the dollar. The advance was supported by speculation over the potential for a detente between Turkey and its western allies.
The country’s September purchasing manufacturing index fell to 42.7, from 46.4 in August. Exports rose 22.6 percent in September from a year earlier while imports declined 18.1 percent, preliminary data showed Monday. Investors have been concerned about the current-account deficit following pro-growth policies by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The lira has lost more than a third of its value this year as monetary and fiscal policy remained too loose to anchor the nation’s assets against a resurgent dollar. Turkey’s central bank raised rates aggressively last month in a bid to support the currency, with investors now watching for an end to a diplomatic spat with the U.S.
The lira gained as much as 1.6 percent to 5.9581 per dollar. While the dollar-lira pair has been probing the 6.00 level over the past few sessions, the “missing element” for a decisive break is an improvement in relations between the U.S. and Turkey, said Piotr Matys, a currency strategist at Rabobank. The next target is the Aug. 16 low at 5.6968, he said.
Erdogan met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week, a sign that he is trying to patch up rocky relations with the European Union. Some investors are also hoping that a jailed American pastor will be released at a hearing on Oct. 12 to end a diplomatic standoff that saw Washington impose sanctions against NATO ally Turkey.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar slipped against the Canadian dollar on Monday as the United States and Canada reached a framework deal to update the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
Sources with direct knowledge of the talks confirmed the two countries reached a deal, which involved offering more dairy access to U.S. farmers as well as Canada agreeing to a side-letter arrangement effectively capping automobile exports to the United States.
A Mexican source close to the NAFTA talks separately said: ""we have a trilateral deal.""
The Canadian dollar  rose about 0.7 percent, reaching a four-month high of C$1.2814 as the news about the framework agreement broke, before giving up some gains. It last traded at C$1.2836.
The loonie added to the previous session's gains of more than one percent.
""Though markets were already anticipating an agreement, one source of worry will be swept away if a deal is made,"" Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo, said.
""That will lead to a rise in trust in the U.S. economy, so it's easy for risk sentiment to improve."" 
""The Canadian dollar is really strong today. Together with that, it's easy for currencies from resource-dependent and emerging market countries to rise, putting selling pressure on the dollar.""
Mexico's peso currency  strengthened to a seven-week high versus the dollar, at one point gaining about 0.85 percent to 18.54 per dollar.
The yen , meanwhile, weakened to 113.96 per dollar, reaching its lowest since the middle of November 2017 before paring some losses. It last traded 0.2 percent higher at 113.90 per dollar.
The greenback has risen four straight weeks against the Japanese currency, including a nearly 1 percent gain booked last week.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration had said Canada must sign on to the text of the updated North American Free Trade Agreement before Monday local time or face exclusion from the pact. Washington has already reached a side deal with Mexico, the third NAFTA member.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, edged less than 0.1 percent higher to 95.197, not far off a more than two-week high of 95.366 reached on Friday.
For the third quarter, the dollar index posted its second consecutive quarterly gain, rising more than half a percent. 
The euro (EUR=) was down 0.1 percent at $1.1595, with worries about a rise in Italy's deficit weighing on the single currency after the Italian government agreed to set a higher than expected budget deficit target.

The rial has slumped due to a weak economy, difficulties at local banks and heavy demand for dollars among Iranians who fear Washington's withdrawal from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal and renewed U.S. sanctions could shrink Iran's oil exports and derail its economy.
A set of U.S. sanctions targeting Iran's oil industry is due to take effect in November. President Hassan Rouhani has called the sanctions an ""economic war"" against Iran.
A top government body, headed by Rouhani and the heads of parliament and the judiciary, ""gave the central bank governor the necessary authority to intervene in the foreign exchange market and to manage it"", state TV said.
""The central bank will intervene in the foreign exchange market through banks and authorized exchange shops and carry out the necessary measures to control the exchange rate of hard currencies,"" the television quoted the body as saying.
The central bank will ""announce the rate of exchange in the foreign exchange market at an appropriate time,"" the body added.
It was not immediately clear whether Saturday's announcement meant the government would return to a policy, abandoned in recent months, of injecting hard currencies into the market.
The Iranian rial hit a record low on the unofficial market on Wednesday, and was offered for 186,000 rials to the dollar according to foreign exchange websites. The rial has lost approximately 75 percent of its value so far this year.
On Saturday, the first trading day of the week, the rial recouped some its losses to be traded at around 174,300-174,500 per dollar, according to foreign exchange websites 2gheroon.ir and bonbast.com, which track the unofficial market.
The official exchange rate is 42,000 rials per dollar and is used mostly for imports of state subsidized basic goods such as food and medicine.
The top government body also gave final approval to a move allowing money exchange shops to import foreign currency banknotes, and requiring non-oil exporters to repatriate their hard cash earnings within three months to be reinvested or sold in a regulated secondary market to importers. 
Officials have said Iran was moving to ease regulations on imports of hard currency bills and gold by exchange shops, after Washington in August re-imposed sanctions on Iran's purchases of dollars, its trade in gold and precious metals, and its dealings with metals, coal and some software.

The Chicago purchasing manager's index (PMI) fell to a reading of 60.4 in September from 63.6 the prior month.
The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, was flat in August from July, remaining at the Fed's 2% target in annual terms.
The data validated Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's remarks earlier this week when he claimed there was little chance that inflation would ""surprise to the upside,"" which would push the bank to adopt a more hawkish stance on monetary policy.
""Core inflation pressures seem to have crested at the Fed's 2% target the last several months backing up Fed Chair Powell's contention that inflation was unlikely to pose a problem in the future,"" Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi said.
The greenback's retreat from session highs was limited, however, by weakness in the euro as Italian concerns came to the fore. Italy's populist government late Thursday showed little regard to tackling the country's debt burden, setting next year's budget at 2.4% of GDP, above what many had expected, risking backlash from EU policymakers.

The currency fell to its weakest level in more than two years this month after data showing the economy entered a recession in the second quarter, raising the nation’s risk profile at a time when emerging-market assets are under pressure from a rising dollar and global trade tensions. It’s regained some lost ground since President Cyril Ramaphosa unveiled an economic plan last week to try and revive growth.
The rand traded at 14.1617 per dollar by 6:12 p.m. in Johannesburg on Friday. The currency has weakened about 17 percent since February, when it rallied to a three-year high after Ramaphosa succeeded Jacob Zuma as president.
“Anything weaker than 13 rand to the dollar we see as undervalued and we see scope up to 11 rand in terms of equilibrium of the rand,” Coleman said in an interview Friday with Bloomberg Television. “There is significant potential re-rating in a positive sense for the rand to go.”
Coleman said Ramaphosa’s package of proposals announced last week, which the president billed as a stimulus program, is a “stability and recovery plan” that shifts the budget emphasis away from consumption to more productive spending.
The Goldman Sachs executive also said he’s optimistic Ramaphosa will secure victory for the ruling African National Congress in elections that are scheduled to take place in the first half of next year. The new administration is on the “right track,” he said.
“We think that the elections will allow the president to effectively get a renewed mandate from the population which effectively will underpin the modernization program and structural reforms he wants to undertake,” Coleman said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar climbed to a two-week peak versus a basket of currencies on Friday, boosted by gains against the euro amid concerns about the Italian budget and a U.S. interest rate outlook that reflects multiple rate hikes until 2020.
The U.S. dollar also rose to a nine-month high against the yen. 
As the third quarter winds down, the dollar index, a gauge of its value against six major currencies, was on track to post its second consecutive quarterly gain of about 0.7 percent. For the last six months, the greenback has advanced nearly 6 percent. 
""The U.S. dollar remains a metaphorical rock in a sea of troubles,"" said Karl Schamotta, director of global product and market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto.
""The growth outlook for other Group of 10 countries and the emerging markets remains uncertain, and increased confidence in the forces compelling the Federal Reserve to hike rates next year is helping to lift the U.S. dollar against its counterparts,"" he added.

U.S. data on Friday all supported the view of an economy that is on a stable growth path.
U.S. consumer spending rose 0.3 percent last month after an unrevised 0.4 percent gain in July, while a measure of underlying inflation remained at the Fed's 2 percent target for a fourth straight month.
The Chicago Purchasing Management index for September was 60.4, lower than the consensus forecast. The U.S. consumer sentiment index for September, on the other hand, was slightly lower than forecast at 100.1, but still the highest since March.
The euro, meanwhile, slipped below $1.16 for the first time in two weeks after Italy's government agreed on a budget seen by some investors as defying Brussels.
Political wrangling over the budget in heavily indebted Italy has put a lid on a recent revival in the euro's fortunes against the dollar.
The single currency recorded its biggest one-day decline for nearly two months on Thursday as the battle over fiscal policy intensified in the euro zone's third-largest economy.
Financial markets are nervous that the Italian government's spending plans will boost Italy's debt, which is already the second highest in the euro zone as a share of economic output after Greece, near 131 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).

The government is targeting a budget deficit at 2.4 percent of GDP, inside the 3 percent ceiling prescribed by EU rules.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.68% to 94.52.
The Federal Open Market Committee increased the overnight funds rate to a range of 2.00% to 2.25% and delivered an upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy, hiking its outlook on domestic GDP for both this year and 2019.
Fed officials hinted another rate hike would follow at year-end, with more hikes expected in 2019, prompting analysts to suggest the greenback has further room to advance.
Higher U.S. interest rates tend to boost the attractiveness of the greenback.
But the fiscal hangover, trade wars and tighter monetary policy could restrain economic growth in 2019 by more than the Fed expects, resulting in an earlier pause in the hiking cycle than forecast, which could halt the dollar's strength earlier than expected,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) said.
The dollar's strong rally intraday comes despite data showing ongoing weakness in the housing market, which is expected to deteriorate further as higher interest rates typically spawn higher mortgage rates, stifling homebuying activity.
The National Association of Realtors’ pending home sales measure fell 1.8% to 104.2 in August.

301,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 04:50AM ET</span>","Hawkish Fed Means Dollar to Pass 115 Yen, $1.13 vs Euro: NatWest","(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve’s most important move Wednesday might have been the bump up in its longer-term projection for the policy interest rate -- and that’s bound to help the dollar, according to NatWest Markets.
“We expect the dollar to keep benefiting from rising carry returns, with the euro and yen still at risk of making new one-year lows through $1.13 and 115 respectively over the next few months,” Mansoor Mohi-uddin, the head of foreign-exchange strategy at NatWest in Singapore, wrote in a note. The euro was at $1.1704 and the yen at 112.63 per dollar as of 9:07 a.m. in London.
In the early days of the rate-hiking cycle that began in 2015, U.S. central bankers were lowering their longer-term expectations for the policy rate, and that countered the otherwise positive impact of monetary tightening on the dollar, Mohi-uddin said. They stopped lowering the forecast this year, allowing Fed hikes to support the greenback, the argument goes.
Fed officials have boosted their median estimate for the longer-term federal funds rate to 3 percent, from 2.875 percent in June. The Fed also bumped its current target range for the rate by a quarter point, to 2 percent to 2.25 percent Wednesday.
Through raising the longer-term estimate, the central bank is “signaling its current tightening hasn’t become ‘late cycle’ yet,” Mohi-uddin wrote. With the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan likely to keep rates on hold at least until later in 2019, that makes for a yield-premium boost for the dollar, the Natwest argument concludes.

The central bank dropped the word ""accommodative"" to describe its monetary policy stance in its statement, saying the change does not signal any change in the bank's path toward normalizing monetary policy.
Some traders took the change to mean that if the Fed no longer believes its policy is accommodative, it may be moving closer to the end of its monetary tightening cycle.

The Fed’s Chairman Jerome Powell also discussed trade related issues, adding that the Fed had heard a ""rising chorus of concerns from businesses all over the country.""
He also indicated there was no change in his thinking on monetary policy, although the Fed made an amendment to the statement by removing the use of “accommodative” to describe its stance on monetary policy.
There was much debate about whether removal of that key phrase was hawkish or dovish, but the Fed chief poured some cold water on the speculation.

Powell also noted that he doesn't see inflation surprising to the upside.
The dollar initially sold off quickly following the statement, as markets believed the removal of ""accommodative"" in the statement indicates less urgency for tightening. Some analysts said, however, that it was ""stretch"" to suggest such tweak in language was dovish.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher on Wednesday in choppy trading after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates as expected for the eighth time, flagged more rate hikes and signaled the end of the ""accommodative"" policy era.
The greenback briefly fell against the euro and yen after the release of the Fed statement but slowly inched higher as market participants digested the statement.
Fed policymakers lifted the benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 2.00 percent to 2.25 percent. The central bank also removed from its policy statement a description of monetary policy as remaining accommodative.
""Today's dropping of keyword 'accommodative' from its policy statement ensures the Fed remains on course for further hikes as unemployment heads towards multi decade lows,"" said Robert Sierra, director at Fitch Ratings. 
""The Fed continues to be very much focused on strong domestic conditions and neither trade concerns nor recent emerging market turbulence affected today's decision,"" he added.
For Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC), head of North American FX strategy, at TD Securities in Toronto, however, the removal of the word ""accommodative"" is a dovish signal and was the reason for the initial fall in the dollar. 
""To me, it means that the Fed is more or less in a neutral stance and is probably close to being done raising rates,"" McCormick said.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell clarified that the removal of ""accommodative"" in the statement is a sign that monetary policy is proceeding in line with expectations.

The housing data arrived ahead of the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates and the central bank's release of its projection for inflation, forecasts of future rates and unemployment.
As the Fed's decision draws closer, the debate continues as to whether the Federal Reserve will continue to describe its monetary policy as ""accommodative."" Monetary policy hawks, meanwhile, will likely parse the Fed data for any indication for steeper rate hikes in the coming years.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's central bank governor resigned on Tuesday in the midst of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, dealing a blow to President Mauricio Macri's efforts to shore up investor confidence and sending the peso tumbling.
Luis Caputo's surprise resignation after just three months in the role came as a nationwide strike by unions, called to protest Macri's handling of the economy, shuttered public transit and ports across the country.
Former Economic Policy Secretary Guido Sandleris, who holds a doctorate in economics from Columbia University, was named as Caputo's replacement, a statement from the presidency said.
Argentina has been at the center of emerging market jitters in recent months. It has seen its peso currency lose more than 50 percent of its value so far this year amid concerns that a recession could impact the government's ability to pay its foreign debts. 
Caputo, a former finance minister whose appointment three months ago was supposed to restore investors' faith in monetary policy, is the second Argentine central bank president to resign this year. A hike in central bank benchmark interest rates to 60 percent has failed to stem a slide in the peso.
The peso  fell a further 6.7 percent in late morning trade on Tuesday to 40.0 per U.S. dollar. The Merval stock index (MERV) rose more than 2.5 percent in thin trading after the announcement, led by energy stocks that price their sales in dollars.
""This resignation is due to personal reasons, with the conviction that a new agreement with the International Monetary Fund will reestablish confidence in the fiscal, financial, monetary and exchange rate situation,"" the central bank said in a statement.
Sandleris is a close ally of Economy Minister Nicolas Dujovne, who was at odds with Caputo in recent weeks over how to handle monetary policy during the crisis, according to Argentine media reports.
Sandleris did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Argentina is in talks with the IMF to bolster a $50 billion standby financing agreement after a severe drought this year crippled the grain export sector and the run on the peso sparked fears the country would be unable to service its foreign debts in 2019.
An IMF spokesman said the organization looked forward to continuing its close relationship with the central bank under Sandleris' leadership.
Local media reported that a deal would be announced on Wednesday. However, foreign investors were jolted by Caputo's departure. 
""The timing could not be worse for Argentina,"" said Paul Greer, Portfolio Manager, Fidelity Emerging Market Debt Fund. ""Negotiations with the IMF about an expanded and revamped program have taken longer than expected, and Caputo's resignation will only add to investor uncertainty.""
A government source told Reuters on Monday that a deal was likely in the coming days and could include some $3-5 billion in additional financing. Nomura said in a research note on Tuesday that investors had been hoping for an additional $10-$20 billion to allay concerns over debt servicing. 

The Treasury Ministry estimated that Tuesday's strike could wipe out 31.6 billion pesos in lost output, or roughly 0.2 percent of gross domestic product.

The lira has lost nearly 40 percent of its value against the U.S. currency this year on concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan's grip on monetary policy and, more recently, due to a diplomatic row between Turkey and the United States.
In August U.S. President Donald Trump slapped additional tariffs on Turkish imports over the trial of evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson on terrorism charges. Turkey responded in kind, raising tariffs on some U.S. imports.
Erdogan is visiting the United States this week to attend a United Nations meeting. Pompeo said on Monday that he expected talks with Turkish officials this week, during which Brunson's fate will be discussed.
""If they can solve the (issue) with the U.S. that will be quite a relief and we will see the dollar-lira going below 6 if this is announced,"" said Jakob Christensen, head of emerging market research at Danske Bank.
""But we are seeing the challenges of a weak economy underlying and therefore we think the lira will weaken towards the dollar over the next year.""
The lira  firmed to 6.1424 against the dollar by 0921 GMT, compared to a close of 6.1600 on Monday.
ECONOMY PROGRAM
However, it was not clear whether the talks would lead to any improvement in relations. Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin told reporters in New York on Monday that Turkey's judiciary would make a decision on Brunson and urged everyone to respect the court's ruling. Brunson's next trial session is set to take place on Oct. 12.
The row between Ankara and Washington helped send the lira to a record low of 7.24 against the dollar in August. The currency has since rebounded with a series of measures taken to prop up the lira, including a 6.25 percentage point rate hike by the central bank and a new economy program announced by the government.
But along with a weak lira, double-digit inflation and the main interest rate at 24 percent, Turkey's economy has recently shown signs of a noticeable slowdown in the second half of the year.
The new economy program presented by Finance Minister Berat Albayrak last week showed sharply lower growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019. The latest data for economic and manufacturing confidence indices showed that both indicators had tumbled to their lowest since 2009.

Investors are also concerned about the state of the banking sector, which faces a potential deluge of bad debt with companies' cost of servicing foreign-currency debt increasing with the decline in the lira.

LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds are betting big against sterling, the most since May last year. And following last week's Brexit debacle in Salzburg, that bet will probably be even bigger now, closing in on the largest on record.
Funds and speculators have been growing increasingly bearish on the pound since April, when it traded above $1.42. Their aggressive selling helped to drive it below $1.27 last month. 
They have increased their net short position in sterling in the latest week to 79,258 contracts, according to the latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission figures from U.S. futures exchanges. That's a $6.51 billion bet against the pound.
But those figures are for the week ending Sept. 18. That was Tuesday, before the European Union summit in Salzburg on Thursday, which laid bare the chasm between Britain and the EU on Brexit. 
Talks between the EU and Prime Minister Theresa May on how to manage Britain's withdrawal from the bloc, which is only six months away, hit a brick wall. The consensus seemed to be that it was a humiliation for May.
She hit back the following day with a defiant speech that cheered the Tory party faithful and eurosceptic elements of the UK media. But as far as the FX market was concerned, it only raised the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. 
Sterling duly tumbled, falling more than two cents against the dollar, or 1.7 percent, marking its biggest one-day fall in nearly two years. There's every chance hedge funds already betting on the pound falling will have doubled down.
Their net short position of 79,258 contracts is already among the largest since CFTC began compiling data in 1995. The only time it has ever been bigger was the year after the Brexit referendum itself, between July 2016 and May 2017.

""MATERIAL NEGATIVE""
The speculative community's turn against sterling since April has been sharp. Then, they were net long to the tune of 47,702 contracts, a bet worth $4.26 billion. Their $6.51 billion short position now marks a swing of $10.77 billion in five months.
And that may only be the tip of the iceberg. Analysts at one large bank estimate that the CFTC positions are only around 20 to 30 percent of all short positions in the pound across the global currency market. 
Bank of New York Mellon's Simon Derrick said on Monday that the bank's internal flow data show investors ""continuing to shun sterling"". Analysts at JP Morgan are also recommending that clients stay short.
In a note on Friday, Deutsche Bank's Oliver Harvey said May's speech was a ""material negative"" for sterling. A Brexit deal remains his base case scenario, but he recommends selling the pound against the euro ""to hedge against an increasing deterioration of Brexit negotiations"".
Sterling's fortunes against the dollar and hedge funds' positions have been pretty closely correlated since the Brexit referendum in June 2016. That's likely to remain the case in the months ahead, and the primary drivers of both are likely to remain Brexit and UK political developments.

Harvey notes that positioning in sterling remains short but well below extremes. It could get worse for the pound before it gets better. ""A negative turn in the politics still leaves plenty of downside, in our view,"" he said.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's lira firmed more than 3 percent on Monday after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he expected discussions with Turkish officials this week over the fate of a U.S. pastor whose trial has strained relations. 
The lira has tumbled 40 percent against the dollar this year, hit by concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan's influence on monetary policy and the diplomatic row with Washington.
U.S. President Donald Trump has slapped tariffs on Turkey over its trial of Andrew Brunson, an evangelical Christian pastor from North Carolina, who has lived in Turkey for more than two decades. He is facing terrorism charges, which he denies.
Pompeo told reporters in New York he expected talks with Turkish officials to take place this week to discuss Brunson's fate. Erdogan is visiting the United States this week for a United Nations meeting.
""Yes he could be released this month. He should have been released last month. And he should be released today in fact. We have talked to the Turks. They know the expectations,"" Pompeo told reporters in New York.
""Pastor Brunson and the other U.S. persons that are being held by Turkey all need to be released by Turkey and that needs to be done immediately,"" he added.
The lira  firmed as far as 6.0575 against the dollar as of 1607 GMT, compared with Friday's close of 6.2900. It later weakened to 6.15 to the dollar at 1831 GMT.
Speaking to reporters in New York, Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said the decision on Brunson would be made by the judiciary and urged everyone to respect the court's ruling.
""Obviously we want to have good relations with every country, including the United States, but we have to resolve the issues between the two countries through diplomacy,"" Kalin said.
""It's not just about Pastor Brunson, but a number of other issues, including the American support for the YPG in Syria, which is a concern for our national security.""
Turkey considers the YPG militia a terrorist organization linked to Kurdish militants on its soil.
REBOUND SUSTAINABLE?
The sell-off in the lira has raised concerns about the impact on the broader economy and put particular focus on Turkey's banks. Ratings agency Fitch said on Monday that banks' foreign-currency liquidity risk had heightened significantly amid volatility and currency weakness.
The central bank this month hiked interest rates by 6.25 percent to stem inflation and put a floor under the currency. Last week the government rolled out a new economic program with lower growth estimates, although many investors have given it a lukewarm reception.
""If there is an attempt to improve relations with the U.S. then this would be the third important component that we need to expect this rebound in the lira to prove sustainable,"" said Piotr Matys, an emerging markets forex strategist at Rabobank.
""The other two important components are already in place. The central bank raised interest rate decisively and this was followed by the new economy program, which includes more realistic macroeconomic assumptions."" 
Brunson is one of several U.S. citizens who have been detained in Turkey in the aftermath of a failed coup in 2016, which Ankara blames on a U.S.-based cleric. Turkey has sought the extradition of the cleric, Fethullah Gulen. The United States has said it is a matter for the courts.
Among those jailed is a Turkish-U.S. citizen and former NASA scientist. Serkan Golge was visiting family in southern Turkey when he was arrested in the crackdown that followed the coup.

He plans to file an appeal to Turkey's top court after a lower appeals court reduced his sentence, his lawyer said last week.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro rose to more than a three-month high against the dollar on Monday after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said he sees a vigorous pickup in euro zone inflation, backing moves toward unwinding an ECB asset purchase program meant to stimulate the economy.
The single currency has been on an uptrend the last few weeks, bolstered by generally solid European economic data. Over the last 10 days, the euro has risen 2.5 percent versus the greenback.
The dollar, meanwhile, was little changed to slightly higher against the yen, as investors searched for fresh clues to extend a multi-month rally in the greenback before a widely-expected interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve this week.
The dollar briefly dipped against the yen after some media said U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was headed to the White House amid reports he had offered to resign in anticipation of being fired by President Donald Trump.
Other media, however, reported that Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, had not offered to resign. 
With the Fed decision a few days away, markets were jolted by Draghi's hawkish comments on inflation and wage growth even though he affirmed the ECB's pledge to keep rates at their current, rock-bottom level ""through the summer"" of next year.
John Doyle, director of markets at Tempus Consulting in Washington, said Draghi's remarks reinforced the view that other central banks are catching up with the Fed in terms of tightening monetary policy. 
""The idea of divergence between the Fed tightening and other central banks either on hold or cutting rates is not there to support the dollar anymore,"" Doyle said.
In midday trading, the euro rose 0.2 percent against the dollar to $1.1771 (EUR=). It rose to as high as $1.1815, a 3-1/2-month peak.
The euro earlier was also boosted after German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government resolved a dispute over the country's scandal-tainted spy chief on Sunday, ending a threat to the six-month-old administration.
Against the yen, the dollar was up 0.1 percent at 112.65 yen  ahead of this week's Fed meeting.
With the market forecasting a rate hike this week, another in December and two more next year - roughly in line with Fed policymakers' projections - analysts said only unexpectedly strong data would change those bets.
""Dollar direction could boil down to how many rate hikes the Fed pencils in over the coming year,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. 
""The Fed could increase its forecast for 2019 rate hikes from three to four with inflation showing signs of pushing above its 2 percent goal, a hawkish scenario that would likely be positive for the dollar,"" he added.
Earlier the dollar snapped a two-week losing streak as the weekend brought global trade tensions back into the spotlight after Beijing released a white paper on its trade dispute with the United States, saying it would seek a reasonable outcome, while also describing U.S. tactics as ""bullying.""

The dollar index was last down 0.1 percent at 94.138 (DXY), mainly weighed down by the euro's gains.

325,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 23, 2018 10:20PM ET</span>",Hong Kong's Surging Dollar Sends a Warning on the Housing Market,"(Bloomberg) -- A shock jump in Hong Kong’s currency is signaling a decade-long liquidity party is coming to an end. That may be bad news for the city’s housing market.
The Hong Kong dollar surged as much as 0.6 percent on Friday, its biggest gain in 15 years, and extended gains on Monday. While traders gave differing reasons for the move, the common theme was concern that the city’s borrowing costs will catch up with those in the U.S. as the Federal Reserve continues to hike rates. The chance of local banks raising the so-called prime rate for the first time since 2006 is ""extremely high,"" Financial Secretary Paul Chan said.
A currency peg with the U.S., open financial borders and a booming economy meant Hong Kong property was one of the greatest beneficiaries of ultra-low lending costs in the wake of the global financial crisis. Home prices rose more than 170 percent in the past decade making the city the world’s least affordable.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and CLSA Ltd. are among those warning of a reversal on expectations that mortgage servicing costs will rise.
""The market has underestimated the pace of interest rate increases in Hong Kong,"" said Kevin Lai, chief economist for Asia ex-Japan at Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd. This ""will bring pressure to the property market and leveraged home buyers.""
After trading at the weak end of the band for months, prompting repeated interventions by the city’s de facto central bank, the Hong Kong dollar rocketed into the stronger half of the spectrum on Friday. The currency was 0.15 percent higher at 7.7998 per dollar at 9:07 a.m. local time.
The three-month interbank rate, known as Hibor, was last at 2.125 percent, its highest level in almost a decade. That’s almost triple the 0.75 percent level it was a year ago. A narrowing spread with U.S. Libor is making a previously profitable trade of selling Hong Kong dollars to buy higher yielding U.S. assets less appealing.
""The short-Hong Kong dollar carry trade has come to an end,"" said Ken Peng, an investment strategist at Citi Private Bank in Hong Kong. ""Friday’s move suggests borrowing costs in Hong Kong have tightened a lot and will tighten further.""
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said in emailed comments that while it didn’t want to comment on Friday’s movement in the currency, ""market participants generally view the elevated interbank interest rates as a contributing factor.""
While residential prices in Hong Kong’s secondary market have climbed 16 percent over the past 12 months, according to Centaline Property Agency, developers have begun to offer perks to accelerate sales. Some are selling apartments at discounts, and others aren’t providing mortgages due to concern that rising borrowing costs may increase defaults. Financial Secretary Paul Chan said this month he sees signs the market is cooling.
Record Highs
Predicting declines in Hong Kong’s property market hasn’t been a profitable exercise in the past, with a home-price slump in 2015-2016 quickly followed by new record-highs. But a rising prime rate could change the dynamic of demand for the city’s housing.
""We expect banks to hike prime rate twice this year by a total of 50 basis points, as Hibor rises with a shrinking liquidity pool and Fed hikes,"" said Frank Lee, acting chief investment officer for North Asia at DBS Bank (HK) Ltd. ""It will hurt property market sentiment.""

May further claimed that the UK and EU were at an ""impasse,” denting optimism for a post-Brexit deal agreement following recent reports that the EU were set to adopt a warmer approach to Brexit talks.
GBP/USD fell 1.41% to $1.3075, eroding most of the week's gain as the pair looks set to end the week roughly flat.
The dollar was also supported by profit-taking on emerging-market currencies like the South African rand and Turkish lira, both of which have enjoyed sharp gains on the back of improving sentiment in developing economies.
Turkey unveiled a new economic program earlier this week to reduce its current account deficit, while South Africa's central bank stood pat on interest rates Thursday.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rebounded from early lows and edged higher against most of its rivals on Friday but was still on track for its biggest weekly drop in seven months as stronger equity markets and rising bond yields fueled a rush to buy riskier assets.
With trade war concerns receding in the background and emerging market central banks led by Turkey taking measures to stabilize their currencies, investors pushed the euro to the $1.18 line for the first time in more than three months.
""This is textbook risk-on behavior in the markets and, though it is hard to find an immediate catalyst, falling trade conflict concerns and improvement in emerging market sentiment has helped,"" said John Marley, a senior currency consultant at Smart Currency Business, and FX risk-management specialist.
Premier Li Keqiang pledged on Wednesday that Beijing will not engage in competitive currency devaluation, a day after his country and Washington plunged deeper into a trade war with more tit-for-tat tariffs.
Global shares hit their highest levels in more than six months on Friday while the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) was up 1.27 percent, partly on expectations that Beijing will pump more money into its economy to weather the trade war. 
The dollar index drifted 0.1 percent (DXY) higher to 94.02 as investors consolidated positions before the weekend, but the greenback was set for its biggest weekly drop since February.
A sell-off in the dollar that began in the late European session on Thursday gathered steam overnight as investors ramped up bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve will be near the end of its rate-rise cycle after an expected increase next week.
Market expectations are for approximately two increases to U.S. interest next year and Russell Investments said that medium-term recession risks in the U.S. economy are now elevated, pointing to a number of indicators such as a tightening labor market.
""The weakness in the dollar is prompting investors to unwind their short bets against other currencies such as the euro, and this move may have further room to run,"" said Manuel Oliveri, a currency strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London.
The dollar's bounce pushed the single currency (EUR=EBS) back into the red at $1.1768, taking its gains for the week to nearly 1.5 percent.
Amid a bounce in currencies such as the Turkish lira and South African rand, ravaged earlier in the month by trade friction and domestic factors, MSCI's emerging market currency index (MIEM00000CUS) climbed 0.4 percent to its highest since late August.
The Australian dollar, a proxy of China-related trades as well as a gauge of risk sentiment, climbed to a three-week high of $0.7297 . 

The pound  was the only notable loser against the dollar, weakening nearly 1 percent to $1.3179 on Brexit concerns.

The dollar has been lifted by a stronger-than-expected U.S. economy, the world's largest, and that's a positive sign for global growth, the U.S. investment bank said. 
The U.S. dollar index (DXY) has lost more than 1 percent this week, but this follows months of strong demand over U.S.-China trade-related tensions, as investors bet the greenback would gain at the expense of riskier currencies. [USD/] 
""The risk aversion this summer created significant emerging market destocking, particularly in China, as consumers attempted to avoid a strong dollar and tariffs by liquidating inventories,"" Goldman said in a note dated on Thursday. 
A stronger greenback makes the purchase of dollar-denominated international commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies, making buyers and users more likely to draw on any stored materials in preference to imports. 
""This liquidation, however, has a physical limit with Chinese destocking having already created significant increases in physical (premiums) for oil and metals – a sign of physical shortages."" 
Going forward, oil had a strong fundamental outlook helped by U.S. demand growth, supply losses and disruptions, and still constrained U.S. shale output, Goldman said. 
The bank said its near-term Brent crude oil price (LCOc1) target remained at $80 a barrel. 

The bank said it was moderating its bullish view for gold due to a sell-off in emerging markets, and it lowered its 12-month price forecast for the metal to $1,325 per ounce, down from $1,450 and ounce earlier.

The lira, which surged almost 2 percent after Albayrak announced lower growth and spending targets, erased gains as he skipped details on the key issue, which investors had expected him to clarify. Speculation had been building that authorities would announce a plan to help banks tackle a buildup of bad debt on their balance sheets amid a currency rout that’s knocked 40 percent off the lira’s value this year.
“Front and center has to be evidence the government gets the challenges in the banks,” Timothy Ash, a strategist at BlueBay Asset Management in London, said before the minister’s speech. “The urgent need from the authorities is to be open about the problem, and through innovative solutions like a bad bank, help banks clean up their balance sheets.”

While the currency stabilized after the central bank hiked rates by 625 basis points last week, many investors were looking for signs of further policy action. The lira was initially lifted on Thursday by new growth forecasts, which suggested authorities aren’t planning any major stimulus programs, and are committed to tighter fiscal policy and financial stability. It was trading almost 1 percent lower at 6.3091 per dollar at 3:09 p.m. in Istanbul.
The revised forecasts showed growth slowing to 3.8 percent in 2018 and 2.3 percent in 2019. The latter figure is still significantly more optimistic than the estimate by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, which sees Turkey’s expansion at just 0.5 percent next year. The Turkish economy expanded 5.2 percent in the second quarter of this year and 7.3 percent in the first quarter.
Another key indicator of how the government will handle the expected slowdown in a municipal election year was fiscal targets with new projections suggesting that the government would try and undo this year’s deterioration in the public budget.
Citing the less ambitious targets in the central government’s budget gap and an inflation forecast of 9.8 percent at the end of 2020, Turkey Macro View Consulting Managing Director Inanc Sozer said “macroeconomic targets were realistic.”
“The fact that they don’t see inflation back in a comfortable single-digit zone for three years shows that they are aware of the problems they are facing,” he said. “Investors were worried that another round of fiscal stimulus would chip away at the most recent monetary tightening. So, implementation of fiscal policies announced today will be key.”

Plans to restructure the Development Bank of Turkey and the Real Estate Bank of Turkey also raised concern that the government could stick to some expansionary economic policies.
Market response will now depend on implementation of Albayrak’s plan, said Anastasia Levashova, a fund manager at Blackfriars Asset Management in London. “Now it is all about credit contraction, debt repayments and restructuring and deleveraging -- which will undoubtedly will be painful and lengthy.”"

Not so in the U.S., where expectations for a Federal Reserve rate hike next week are flashing sell signals for the dollar.
 BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management says the broad greenback could plunge 10 percent in the next six to nine months, while Invesco Ltd. forecasts it’ll sink about 3 percent against the euro by year-end. Both firms are watching the Fed’s Sept. 26 decision for any comments on the impact of escalating trade tensions. The two companies also see the currency sliding as other central banks inch closer to monetary tightening.
“We have a turning point where the dollar is going to weaken’’ said Momtchil Pojarliev, deputy head of the currencies team at BNP Paribas Asset Management, which manages $653 billion. The dollar is “at the maximum positive point” and could weaken to $1.25 per euro in the next six to nine months from around $1.17 in Wednesday trading. It’s also a good time to short the U.S. currency against the yen, Pojarliev said.
The market views a 25 basis point Fed rate hike next week as a near certainty, based on fed fund futures. Contracts on Wednesday showed more than 45 basis points of total tightening by the end of 2018. Focus is increasingly shifting to the outlook for next year, with investors moving closer to the central bank’s projected path of three rate hikes for 2019.
That won’t be enough to prop up the greenback, according to Noelle Corum, an Atlanta-based portfolio manager in Invesco Ltd.’s fixed-income group. As global growth improves and market participants start to speculate about policy changes from the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan, the dollar’s support from Fed hikes and trade tensions will wear off, she said.
“Going into year-end, we would expect fundamentals will begin to drive markets again, and this will drive the dollar weaker,’’ said Corum, whose group manages $235 billion. She forecasts the greenback will depreciate to $1.20 per euro and weaken to 104 yen per dollar by year-end.
The U.S. currency has risen more than 5 percent since mid-April, bolstered by a robust economy, gradual tightening by the Fed and haven flows as investors sought refuge from escalating trade tensions. That’s been painful for investors who began the year with a bearish mentality following a 8.5 percent decline in 2017.
As the dollar started to gain steam this year, speculators piled into bullish bets. Long-dollar wagers are now the third-most crowded trade in financial markets, according to fund managers surveyed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) Global Research. And yet, prominent investors including Ray Dalio, who founded the world’s biggest hedge fund at Bridgewater Associates, and Jeffrey Gundlach, chief investment officer at DoubleLine Capital, are turning bearish alongside some Wall Street strategists.
“The Fed needs to be taken in the context of other themes like trade,” said Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC), North American head of FX strategy at Toronto-Dominion Bank. “The market anticipates a hike and there is more room to fade the USD as positioning looks well-populated.”"

If implemented in a country in chaos where the central bank struggles to impose its will, the move devalues the official rate of the dinar to the dollar for such deals to around 3.9 from 1.4, Libya's Eqtisidiya business TV channel said.
Its impact was unclear. The black market rate stands at around 6, and the fee covers only part of the market. Family allowances will be excluded as well as possibly imports of fuel and other subsidized goods.
The gap has done much to distort Libya's oil-dependent economy, contributing to a liquidity crisis and causing corruption as armed groups with access to dollars at the official rate make huge profits through import scams.
The fee is supposed to be paid on commercial transactions but it remains unclear how it will be collected.
""The imposed fee will be 183 percent on sales of foreign currency based on daily publications of the rates of the Libyan dinar versus foreign currencies by the central bank,"" a government decree said.
Commercial banks which grant foreign currencies at the official rate on orders from the central bank are in practice controlled by armed groups which stand to lose if they pay the fee.
Last week, the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli announced a program of economic reforms to correct distortions in the economy, targeting the exchange rate and fuel subsidies. It did not give details then on the fee mentioned in the statement.
It had specified that the fee would be imposed on personal and commercial dealings -- that would most likely exclude imports of fuel and other heavily subsidized goods.
Travel allowances for Libyan families, which make with fuel imports the bulk of hard currency allocations, would be excluded, the government had said last week.
Smugglers, often linked to armed groups, make a huge profit by shipping petrol to Tunisia or Malta where the retail prices are much higher. Imported wheat gets smuggled to southern neighbors Chad and Niger.
Last week, the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli announced a program of economic reforms to correct distortions in the economy, targeting the exchange rate and fuel subsidies. It did not give details then on the fee mentioned in the statement.
The issue of reforms became more urgent late in August with the eruption of clashes between armed groups vying for access to public funds.
The U.N. brokered a ceasefire which has since been broken, and fighting was raging late on Tuesday in southern Tripoli.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar was steady against the euro and the Japanese yen and slipped against the risk-sensitive Aussie, as investors appeared little shaken by the latest round of tariffs announced by China and the United States.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was about flat on the day at 94.647. 
The euro was 0.04 percent lower, while the yen, which tends to benefit during geopolitical or financial stress as Japan is the world's biggest creditor nation, was slightly lower against the greenback .
The Australian dollar, seen as a proxy for China-related trades as well as a barometer of broader risk sentiment, was 0.48 percent higher .
""The market reaction seems to suggest that the tariff announcement was overall on the soft side of market expectation,"" said Alvise Marino, an FX strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in New York.
China and the United States plunged deeper into a trade war after President Donald Trump levied tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. Beijing retaliated with duties on about $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
But Washington's new duties were set at 10 percent for now, before rising to 25 percent by the end of 2018, rather than an outright 25 percent, as some market participants had feared.
Traders will be paying attention to next week's Federal Reserve meeting at which the U.S. central bank is expected to raise benchmark interest rates and shed light on the path for future rate hikes. 
On Wednesday, risk appetite held up across markets. Emerging-market currencies firmed, led by the Indian rupee after China said it would not retaliate with competitive currency devaluations.
The euro struggled to advance above the $1.17 line as a rise in Italian bond yields on budget concerns prompted investors to trade broad market ranges.
Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Wednesday stressed that he would not pull the plug on monetary easing until inflation hits his 2 percent target, warning that escalating international trade disputes could inflict widespread damage to global growth.
The Canadian dollar strengthened to its highest in nearly three weeks against its U.S. counterpart, before paring most of its gains ahead of further talks to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement. 

Sterling gave up earlier gains and briefly hit the day's lows on Wednesday at $1.3098 after the Times reported that Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May had rejected an improved offer from European Union chief negotiator Michel Barnier on the Irish border issue.

343,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>","Turkey to cut growth forecasts, sources say, in difficult balancing act with markets","By Orhan Coskun and Nevzat Devranoglu
ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey will on Thursday cut its growth forecasts for this year and next amid a deep currency crisis, although the extent of next year's revision is still being debated by top government officials, sources said.
The discussion over the growth targets underscores the delicate balance between President Tayyip Erdogan's long-standing emphasis on credit-fuelled economic expansion and investors' calls for greater austerity.
Finance Minister Berat Albayrak is due to announce the forecasts in a new medium-term program on Thursday, after a 40 percent plunge in the lira this year that has eroded confidence in what was once a star emerging market. 
Albayrak, Erdogan's son-in-law, has promised ""realistic macro targets"" and ""right action plans"". 
Investors want to see signs the government is moving away from a decade and a half of growth driven by credit and big infrastructure projects. They are, therefore, hoping for big reductions to the current targets of 5.5 percent annual expansion in 2018 and 2019.
The outlook for 2018 growth is likely to be cut to 3.5-4 percent, said three sources, all of whom declined to be identified because the information is not yet public. 
""There will be almost zero growth or a contraction in the third quarter, and a contraction in the fourth quarter. It is probable that growth will be 3.5-4 percent this year,"" one of them said.
Yet the forecast for 2019 - likely to be a major focus for financial markets - is still being hashed out.
""The 2019 growth forecast is one of the most controversial and sensitive numbers in the medium-term program,"" one of the sources said. ""It could be cut to around 2.5 percent, although this number may change."" 
Two of the sources said the government may want to see a ""slightly higher"" number than 2.5 percent, given that it faces local elections in March 2019. Next year's growth is likely to be helped by an increase in exports and strong tourism revenues, government officials have said.
LIRA CRISIS
""The government needs to show they understand the consequences of the present lira crisis,"" said Per Hammarlund, chief emerging markets strategist at SEB.
""They need to show they are realistic about their budget assumptions for next year, or investors will wonder how big the current account deficit will be, and how much the funding need will be. Unless they are realistic, the lira will quickly come under renewed pressure."" 
Last week, the central bank hiked its benchmark by a mammoth 6.25 percentage points in an attempt to put a floor under the lira and rein in 18 percent inflation, the highest in a decade and a half. The currency crisis has been driven by concerns about Erdogan's control over monetary policy and a bitter row with the United States.
Next year's inflation forecast is likely to remain in double digits, two of the sources said, with one putting this year's inflation number at around 20 percent.
Authorities were taking steps to curb non-mandatory public investments to boost savings, they said.
""The resources available in the budget will mainly be used to finish projects that are close to completion. Projects that will be carried out with the public-private sector cooperation will not be impacted by this decision,"" one of the sources said. 
But it was not clear whether any steps would be announced to help the banking sector, which is grappling with a potential wave of non-performing loans, given its exposure to foreign-currency debt.
One of the sources said every measure would be taken to prevent the real sector and financial sector from being damaged and added that certain projects were being prepared in this regard.
""I'd like to see very conservative economic assumptions for the next few years, meaning persistent high inflation and low growth assumptions. Also I'd like to see some sort of contingency plan in terms of an acknowledgement of potential defaults,"" said Koon Chow, an emerging markets strategist at UBP.

""Everyone will understand that policymakers may take the view that the banking system has been very strong and (non-performing loans) won't rise much, however, you still need to plan for the risk that you are wrong.""

The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier previously suggested that checks would need to be carried out at British and Northern Irish ports on only one category of goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
Four categories of goods would be affected if the backstop took effect and Northern Ireland was to remain in the EU customs union and single market.
May is currently in Salzburg, Austria to discuss Brexit with European leaders. If informal talks do not go well, there will be little hope among investors of a deal when the UK officially leaves the EU in March.

“Recent fluctuations in the renminbi exchange rate have been seen as an intentional measure, but that isn’t true,” Li said in a keynote speech at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin on Wednesday. “One-way devaluation will do more harm than good to China’s economy. China will by no means stimulate exports by devaluing the yuan.”
The offshore yuan rose 0.15 percent after the comments, buying 6.8509 per U.S. dollar as of 11:24 a.m. in Hong Kong.
Li’s comments come as trade tensions with the U.S. escalate, with both sides pledging to impose new tariffs from next week, threatening to worsen the slowdown of China’s economy. While policy-makers have implemented easing measures ranging from tax cuts to central-bank liquidity injections, they have refrained from broad-based fiscal or monetary stimulus for now.
Li said that policy makers are currently facing more difficulty in keeping stable economic progress, and will now make greater efforts to prioritize employment. The government is also seeking ways to further cut taxes and fees, he said, while the central bank will stick with “prudent” monetary policy.
China has accelerated the pace of financial opening this year, seeking to lure more foreign investment as the yuan weakens and threats to output increase. Growth in the world’s second-largest economy is forecast to slow this year to 6.6 percent, slightly higher than the official target.

The currency fell as much as 1 percent against the dollar, with the losses being compounded as long positions initiated after last week’s 625-basis-point interest-rate increase get stopped out, according to an Istanbul-based trader who declined to be named. The lira led emerging-market losses and its volatility is the highest among peers.
While the aggressive policy move was lauded for reaffirming the central bank’s independence, a 40 percent slide in the currency this year has dealt a blow to an economy that relies heavily on foreign inflows to keep growth ticking along. And with inflation nearing 18 percent, many investors think the central bank waited too long to act decisively.
The lira was trading 0.5 percent lower at 6.3444 per dollar as of 11:25 a.m. in Istanbul, taking losses this week to near 3 percent.
The corporate sector is sitting on a $216 billion foreign-exchange shortfall, and analysts say that pent-up demand for hard currency may be standing in the way of any meaningful rally. On Thursday, Turkish retail and corporate investors bought up to $2 billion dollars, according to traders, slowing the lira’s gains.
“I think it’s obvious that the domestic Turkish corporate sector is stuck short dollar-lira. Every dip they see is an opportunity to decrease that exposure,” said Saed Abukarsh, the co-founder of Dubai-based hedge fund Ark Capital. “We may see bouts of Turkish lira demand but the underlying problem is still there. Credibility. And domestics are not buying the story.”
In an effort to further shore up the currency, the central bank in Ankara raised the interest rate for lira-denominated reserve requirements to 13 percent from 7 percent, according to a document seen by Bloomberg News. Attention will next turn to the government’s medium-term economic program due Thursday, where investors will be looking for authorities to commit to a tight fiscal stance to help narrow the country’s twin deficits."

European Union leaders agreed at the end of June to allow the ESM bailout fund to lend in an emergency to the existing bank resolution fund if it runs out of cash in a crisis. They left it to finance ministers to settle the details by December.
""It is now urgent to deliver on it (the June agreement) by the end of this year,"" Villeroy, who is also governor of the French central bank, told a financial regulation conference in Paris.
""Two key issues remain: how to fund the backstop at a sufficiently high level to be credible, and how to create a swift decision-making process to deal with emergencies. If we need weeks to activate the backstop, then the backstop is useless,"" he said.
The EU's bank-financed rescue fund for failing lenders was set up as part of a banking union plan during the financial crisis, but it still lacks enough cash to cope with a large banking crisis, meaning it would require a safety net.
The backstop issue, along with a common insurance scheme for European depositors, have long blocked the completion of the euro zone's banking union with a single supervisory body.

Villeroy said that making the resolution fund fully operational should be a priority, which would in turn open the way for a ""pragmatic compromise"" on deposit insurance.

With little data on the economic calendar, market focus will largely be attuned to the next potential steps in the tit-for-tat trade dispute between the U.S. and China.
U.S. President Donald Trump is likely to announce new tariffs on about $200 billion on Chinese imports as early as Monday, a senior administration official told Reuters.

The currency recovered 4 percent against the dollar last week but was still 39 percent weaker this year in a slide driven by concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan's influence over monetary policy and a diplomatic row with the United States.
Finance Minister Berat Albayrak will announce Turkey's medium-term economic progamme on Thursday. He has promised cost-cutting measures and more efficient spending as the economy enters an expected sharp slowdown.
Erdogan said on Friday Turkey was freezing new government investment projects to rein in spending and stem double-digit inflation after a 15-year construction boom fueled by debt.

Financial markets have long been concerned about Erdogan's control over monetary policy, which they say has undermined the central bank's ability to fight inflation, now at 18 percent. He has described himself as an ""enemy of interest rates"".

The dollar index (DXY) against a basket of major currencies held at 94.965, well above Friday's 94.359 which was the lowest since end-July.
The dollar  was last at 111.99 yen, within kissing distance of Friday's 112.16 which was the highest since mid-July. It gained 0.9 percent last week. 
The dollar has seen a surge in safe-haven demand from an escalation of global trade tensions involving the United States, China, Canada and the European Union. Expectations of faster U.S. rate rises have also pulled the currency higher.
Investors continue to be bullish on the greenback with net long positions of $19.2 billion, according to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) data released on Friday.
The CFTC report also showed the major positioning changes were in the euro, with net longs increasing. Net shorts in sterling and the Swiss franc also declined. 
The euro (EUR=) and sterling each rallied last week on encouraging developments on terms for Britain's exit from the European Union, paring some safe-haven demand for the dollar.

The tariff level will probably be about 10%, the Wall Street Journal reported, quoting people familiar with the matter. This is below the 25% the administration said it was considering for this possible round of tariffs.
Besides trade rhetoric, the U.S. will see a relatively quiet week in terms of economic releases, with a report on the housing sector expected to draw the most attention.
Economists reckon the data will do little to alter expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates when it meets the following week.
This week's calendar also features flash survey data on euro zone business activity for September, which should give some indication of how the region's economy is coping with global trade conflicts, Italian politics and messy Brexit negotiations.
The latest snapshots of UK inflation and retail sales will also capture some attention.
Staying in Europe, Brexit talks are set to intensify over the coming week, with the first of three summits that European Union leaders hope will settle an agreement for departing Britain within the next two months.
Elsewhere, in Asia, a monetary policy announcement from the Bank of Japan will be on the agenda, though no change is expected.
The dollar ticked higher against its rivals on Friday, as upbeat U.S. economic data and higher Treasury yields rekindled some investor appetite for the greenback.
The U.S. Commerce Department said domestic retail sales rose 0.1% in August, the smallest gain in six months, but July figures were revised higher, supporting the view of solid consumer spending in the third quarter.
Consumer spending, which accounts for two-third of the U.S. economy, will likely hold firm as consumer optimism improved to its strongest since March, according to the University of Michigan.
Another bright spot was a 0.4% increase in industrial output last month.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, ended 0.47% higher at 94.97, trimming its weekly decline to 0.4%.
The data also lifted Treasury yields, with the 10-year yield touching 3% for the first time in six weeks.
The euro climbed to a two-week high of 1.1721 earlier on Friday before retreating against the greenback. The common currency ended down 0.57% at 1.1623.
The European Central Bank kept its policy unchanged as expected last week, staying on track to end bond purchases this year and raise interest rates next autumn.
Sterling closed 0.3% lower against the dollar at 1.3070, pulling back after hitting 1.3145 earlier on Friday, its highest level since July 31.
The Bank of England also kept interest rates on hold last week and highlighted greater financial market concerns about Brexit.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.38% to 94.89.
Trump instructed aides on Thursday to proceed with tariffs on about $200 billion more in Chinese products, but the announcement has been delayed as the administration considers revisions based on concerns raised in public comments, Bloomberg reported, citing sources.
The prospect of further trade penalties on Beijing propped up demand for the greenback, as traders bet the U.S. economy would be able to better weather a trade war storm than China's.
The biggest reaction, however, was seen in the trade-war proxy AUD/JPY, which fell 0.32% to 80.25.
The Australian economy relies heavily on exporting raw materials (primarily metals), particularly to China, which accounts for about a third of Australian exports every year.
The risk-sensitive USD/JPY rose 0.09% to Y112.02.
The greenback's rise was also supported by upward revisions to July's retail sales data, which overshadowed soft data for August, and signalled underlying consumer strength.
The Commerce Department said on Friday that retail sales rose 0.1% last month, but July's print was revised upward to 0.7%. Retail sales excluding autos was revised to a 0.9% gain for July.
The dollar's recent strength, however, has not met with optimism from all quarters as some analysts expressed concerns that the upcoming midterms could spell trouble.

The central bank on Thursday raised its benchmark rate to 24 percent in the biggest such hike in President Tayyip Erdogan's 15-year rule, boosting the lira  and possibly easing investor concerns about the bank's independence.
The lira  has lost more than 40 percent of its value this year on the back of investor concerns about Erdogan's influence on monetary policy and an ongoing row with the United States that has resulted in reciprocal sanctions and trade restrictions.
On Friday, the lira stood at 6.0342 to the dollar at 0728 GMT. The lira's implied volatility gauges also fell to their lowest levels in more than a month, as sentiment continued to improve.
The bank's decision came hours after Erdogan, a self-described ""enemy of interest rates"", reiterated his opposition to high interest rates and blamed Turkey's high inflation on the central bank's wrong steps.
With Thursday's rate hike, the bank has now raised interest rates by 11.25 percentage points since late April in an attempt to prop up the ailing lira. Key rates now stand at their highest level since 2004, around a year after Erdogan first came to power.
Late on Thursday, Finance Minister Berat Albayrak told pro-government newspaper Sabah that the central bank's move had put an end to any discussions about the bank's independence, and said Turkey would unveil its medium-term economic program on Sept. 20.
Albayrak, who is also Erdogan's son-in-law, said the three-year business plan would put forth ""realistic macro targets"" with the ""right action plans"" toward the economy's problems.
Erdogan and his government have cast the lira crisis as an ""economic war"" against Turkey, repeatedly urging Turks to sell their foreign currency savings to shore up the lira.
In an attempt to support the currency, the central bank and government have taken a series of measures in recent weeks, with Erdogan ruling early on Thursday that property sales and rental agreements must be made in lira, putting an end to such deals in foreign currency.

On Thursday, Erdogan again said the volatility in the currency was ""artificial"" and vowed that his country would emerge stronger from the period ahead if Turks stood tall against the attacks.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar dipped on Friday after weaker-than-expected U.S. inflation data, with the currency already sagging on signs of reduced trade tensions between the United States and China.
Emerging currencies, like the South African rand and the Mexican peso, held onto to gains having surged, as investors in emerging markets registered relief that Turkey's central bank had hiked its policy rate to 24 percent to restore confidence in the lira.
The greenback took a hit overnight after the U.S. consumer price index (CPI), the government's broadest inflation gauge, rose just 0.2 percent in August and less than the 0.3 percent projected by analysts in a Reuters poll.
""The dollar has sagged mainly due to the soft U.S. CPI,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies was a shade lower at 94.491 (DXY) after slipping 0.3 percent on Thursday, when it touched 94.428, its lowest since Aug. 31.

The ECB kept policy unchanged as expected on Thursday, staying on track to end its bond purchases this year and raise interest rates next autumn.
The Turkish lira was a shade weaker at 6.137 per dollar <TRYTOM=D4> after ending the previous day on a gain of more than 4 percent.
The lira surged after Turkey's central bank raised its benchmark one-week repo rate by 625 basis points to 24 percent on Thursday, in a bid to stabilize the currency, which had slumped to a record low against the dollar a month ago.
By tightening policy the central bank demonstrated an independent streak, as Turkish President Tayipp Erdogan is a self-declared enemy of high interest rates.
Following the lira's rally, the South African rand <ZAR=D4> gained 1.3 percent against the dollar on Thursday and the Mexican peso <MXN=D4> rose 1 percent.
MSCI's emerging markets currency index (MIEM00000CUS) bounced further away from a 16-month low reached earlier in the week.
""The rate hike by the Turkish central bank deserves praise but the key point going forward is President Erdogan's views on the monetary tightening,"" said Kota Hirayama, senior emerging market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""It is naive to assume that Erdogan will continue respecting central bank independence. The Turkish central bank will lose credibility again and its rate hike will be wasted if monetary policy is disrupted by politics.""
China's yuan was 0.2 percent weaker at 6.8520 <CNY=CFXS> in onshore trade after gaining more than 0.4 percent the previous day.

The dollar gained some ground against the Chinese yuan on Friday morning. The USD/CNY pair was up 0.06% to 6.8489 at 10:46 PM ET (GMT 02:46).
On Friday, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) set the reference rate for the yuan at 6.8362, stronger than the 6.8488 rate on Thursday. China’s industrial output rose 6.1% in August, beating estimates of a 6% increase.
The yuan has been sliding against the US dollar since April and has lost more than 9% since then. It has gained some ground over the past couple of days, the PBOC set the reference rate stronger two days in a row, after reports that talks on trade between the U.S. and China may resume.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is reportedly working to meet with China’s top economic office Liu He. U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted on Thursday that the pressure is on China but the prospects of talks calmed markets.
The US Dollar Index was up 0.01% to 94.53 in morning trade in Asia, holding steady after falling during the day session in North America.
Still, the yuan faces myriad risks in the months ahead. Speaking on Thursday in Hong Kong, Chris Wood, the chief equity strategy at brokerage and investment firm CLSA, said a sudden shift in the geopolitical climate could push the yuan past the 7 mark and that would force the PBOC to take steps.
Despite the risks, however, bearish bets on the yuan have slowed down. According to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., the value of options on the yuan weakening past the 7 mark fell last week to the lowers in two months, Bloomberg reported.
The Japanese yen was holding flat against the dollar after having lost ground overnight. The USD/CNY pair was down 0.01% to 111.91. The dollar jumped against the yen overnight. On Thursday, the pair was trading at 111.35.
The yen is getting some support from some relatively positive economic news. On Friday, the Japanese government maintained its assessment that the economy is recovering at a moderate pace but noted that capital expenditures are rising, which should push economic growth. The risk of a trade war between the U.S. and China could slow growth down in Japan, however.
The Australian dollar lost some ground against the greenback on Friday morning. The AUD/USD was down 0.08% to 0.7189.
On Thursday, the European Central Bank kept rates steady and announced plans to end bond purchases at the end of this year while keeping interest rates low. The bank sees inflation rebounding and economic growth stable but leveling off."

Consumer prices in the U.S. rose less than expected in August, increasing 0.2% compared to expectations for a gain of 0.3%.
The inflation numbers came just a day after data showed the producer price index fell 0.1% last month, increasing concerns that the Federal Reserve could ease its hawkish stance.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.35% to 94.49 as of 10:15 AM ET (14:15 GMT).
Meanwhile, the euro and sterling rallied after the Bank of England and European Central Bank kept rates steady.
The ECB kept its deposit rate at -0.40% and repeated that it expects its asset purchase program to end in December after halving it to €15 billion per month starting in October, from €30 billion at present. The BOE kept its interest rate at 0.75%, as expected.

The Central Bank of Turkey increased the one-week repo rate by 625 basis points to 24%, more than analyst expectations for a hike of 425 basis points to 22%.
The bank’s decision was announced hours after Erdogan triggered tumult by repeating his hostility to higher borrowing costs and issuing an order that limited the use of foreign currency in domestic transactions.
The lira rose after the decision and was trading 2.9% higher at 6.1586 per dollar at 7:20AM ET (1020GMT).
The rate hike came alongside a pledge by the bank to enact strong monetary tightening in order to support price stability.
""If needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered,"" the bank said in a statement.
The lira has lost around 40% in value against the dollar since the start of the year, thanks to investor fears over the central bank's independence and a diplomatic and trade fight between Turkish President Recep Erdogan and Washington.

The BoE is also expected to hold fire after raising interest rates last month with market expectations of another rate hike only seen in the second half of next year.
Perhaps attracting more attention is a policy meeting by the Turkish central bank, which is expected to raise interest rates to shore up its battered lira.
The lira traded at 6.3700 per dollar, up about 0.5%. It had slumped to a record low 7.2400 in mid-August.
Meanwhile, against a currency basket, the dollar inched up 0.1% to 94.91 ahead of the release of U.S. consumer price index data due later on Thursday.
The CPI data comes after soft U.S. wholesale price data undermined the case for a faster pace of policy tightening by the Federal Reserve.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to raise benchmark interest rates at its September meeting, but odds for another move in December have decreased in recent days.
Meanwhile, investors remained focused on the U.S.- China trade dispute following news that the Trump administration has invited Chinese officials to restart trade talks, which raised hopes for a deal easing the bitter tariff dispute between the world's two biggest economies.

African Companies Will Avoid Turkey-Type Crisis: Moody's,"(Bloomberg) -- Deep and liquid local debt capital markets have reduced the need for South African companies to borrow abroad, making them less vulnerable to a financial crisis than peers in Turkey and other emerging markets, according to Moody’s Investors Service.
Large external financing needs and a plunging currency are proving a toxic mix for Turkey’s corporate sector. But in South Africa, companies have enough access to local funding, and those that have turned to foreign debt used hedging strategies to cushion the effects of short-term currency fluctuations or buy time to adjust to long-term rand weakness, Moody’s said in a report dated 12 September.
In addition, most foreign borrowing by South African companies has been driven by offshore expansion and the debt is serviced with cash flows generated in the same currency, creating a natural hedge to currency weakness, the report said.
“Currency volatility in emerging markets has been one of the key focus areas for investors this year, particularly in terms of how it affects credit risk for companies,” Moody’s analysts lead by Dion Bate said in the report. “Despite continued rand volatility, we expect the credit quality of most South African companies we rate to remain broadly stable during the next 12 to 18 months.”
Foreign Exposure
About 38 percent of South African non-financial corporate debt is denominated in foreign currencies, according to Moody’s. That compares with 56 percent for Turkey, or an amount of $336 billion, almost triple the borrowers’ assets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The lira’s 40 percent slump this year will make servicing those loans more burdensome, lowering capital spending and GDP growth.
Moody’s expects the rand to remain volatile over the next year, driven by how successful the government is in implementing economic reforms, as well as global factors including the U.S. policy path, trade tensions and emerging-market turmoil. That will complicate the operating environment and investment decisions for South African companies, Moody’s said.

Right now the plan is unchanged: the company wants to raise 9.3 billion in dollars and 3.6 billion in euros ($4.2 billion). But the deal has gained strong early momentum in the U.S. relative to Europe, driving speculation that the dollar side could be increased, either for loans and bonds, or both, according to investors reviewing the deal who asked not to be named.
The deadline for fund managers to commit to loan portion has been brought forward to this Friday, earlier than the original Sept. 17. In Europe, next week’s roadshows have been canceled but London meetings with bond investors take place through to Friday. Arrangers won’t have full clarity on demand from all quarters of the market until late this week.
Cross-border borrowers typically set tranche sizes based on a combination of factors that includes their revenues and the cost of funds available to them in the different markets, including the cost of hedging between currencies. In Refinitiv’s case, its U.S. operations contribute 43 percent of revenues, Europe 40 percent and Asia 17 percent, according to information provided by the company to bondholders.
Want Some More Please
The U.S. market has seen relatively sparse leveraged debt issuance to back M&A this year. This has left buyers hungry for more, whereas in Europe they have had a feast this year, so cross-border borrowers such as Refinitiv could find a more eager bid for dollars. On top of this, the U.S. capital markets are deeper, and investors tend to be less finicky about weak covenants and aggressive structures than their European counterparts.
The European market is still deep, however, and the initially targeted roughly 2 billion euro loan tranche, although very large, should not be out of reach if the credit story and documentation stack up. Demand is driven by a long queue of CLOs wanting to price by year-end, and euro-denominated term loans may appeal to some investors that have been buying U.S. paper, due to the yield pick-up.
Wider Net
On the high-yield bond front, Refinitiv can cast its net wider among potential U.S. investors. The company is being categorized as a financial in the U.S, which is a standard part of the U.S. high-yield benchmark alongside companies classified as corporate. In Europe, financials are off-benchmark for a lot of European high-yield investors.
Bridge In
In addition to this, U.S. investors are said to have taken up more of the $5.5 billion bond bridge sold over the summer, according to fund managers. This would have given those investors that bought the bridge paper a headstart in terms of credit work, and would also mean a significant amount of the bonds were already covered as these investors roll into the deal.
Regulation
Some European investors have also pointed to MIFID II as a possible reason enabling a swifter response from the U.S. buyside. The regulations took effect on Jan. 1 and require European managers to pay for equity and fixed income research. In contrast, their U.S. counterparts will have had access to free research ahead of formal launch, improving their familiarity with the credit.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sent a letter to Chinese officials to propose trade talks in the next few weeks, The Wall Street Journal reported.
The talks would take place before the Trump administration implements additional tariffs on Chinese imports, according to the report.
The news drew a brief retreat in the dollar as traders reined in their bets on a full-blown U.S.-China trade war, which had supported demand for greenback on expectations the United States would fare better than its rivals.
Optimism for an improvement to U.S.-China trade relations comes just a day after the China told the World Trade Organization (WTO) it wants to impose $7 billion a year in sanctions on the United States, citing Washington’s non-compliance with a ruling in a dispute over U.S. dumping duties.
Ahead of consumer inflation data due Thursday, wholesale inflation for August undershot expectations.
The Labor Department said on Wednesday its producer price index for final demand fell 0.1% last month, missing economists' forecast for a 0.2% rise. In the 12 months through August, the producer price index rose 2.8%.
Analysts blamed the sluggish wholesale inflation on falling input prices in the volatile trade-services sector, but said the overall trend remained intact.
""Goods prices were flat, but the miss came in large part from services, specifically a 0.9% drop in the volatile trade-services sector, which measures margins, not selling prices,"" Wells Fargo said. ""Core was softer as transportation and warehousing prices fell, yet the trend remains upward.""

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.17% to 94.89 as of 9:43 AM ET (13:43 GMT).
The Labor Department said on Wednesday its producer price index  decreased 0.1% last month. In the 12 months through August, the PPI rose 2.8%. Economists had forecast the PPI rising 0.2% last month and increasing 3.2% from a year ago.
The PPI is a leading indicator of inflation and is closely watched by the Fed because when producers pay more for goods, they are more likely to pass price increases on to the consumer.
The lower-than-expected data indicated the Fed could slow down rate increases, with the the chance of December hike falling to 79.8%.
Trade tensions also lingered as investors watched trade developments. China is planning to ask the WTO for permission to impose sanctions on the U.S. at a meeting next week in response to U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to impose tariffs on almost all Chinese imports, or about $467 billion in goods.

The pound later recovered to trade flat at $1.3028, while against the euro the British currency was largely unmoved, at 89.010 pence per euro (EURGBP=D3).
In choppy trading in recent days, sterling had hit five-week highs of $1.3087 on renewed hopes of a speedy Brexit deal with Brussels.
While recent signals from Brussels have pointed to renewed confidence that Britain and the European Union can agree a deal to govern trading relations after Brexit, divisions within May's government over Brexit continue to rattle markets. 
The pound has lurched up and down on almost every Brexit-related headline in the past week, as traders struggle to decipher whether Britain can avoid a no-deal Brexit when it leaves the EU. 
Positive economic data in Britain published this week, including relatively strong GDP numbers, have been pushed into the background as investors focus on Brexit developments. 
Traders and analysts say many investors are reluctant to take out big directional bets on sterling because of the uncertainty about where the Brexit negotiations are headed.
""The market is very focused on the immediate and now rather than the future,"" said Neil Mellor, an analyst at BNY Mellon.
Mellor said that investors were increasingly confident EU head of states would rally round May to try and secure a Brexit agreement, reflected in the fact sterling had traded away from its 2018 lows of below $1.27 in mid-August. 

European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday renewed a pledge of close trade and security ties with Britain after Brexit but said the European Union would not compromise on key withdrawal terms.

There’s evidence now to show this argument is weakening. The nation’s 36-currency real effective exchange rate, or REER, was 114.54 in August, a two-year low, and down from 115.32 in July, according to data released Tuesday.
There are dangers in using the overvaluation argument to not support the rupee when it is hitting multiple lows, said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Singapore.
“Observable rupee shifts have far more impact on the psyche - including market psyche,” he said. “And it is hard -- and very expensive -- to catch falling knives once reflexivity sets in.”
The response of policy makers to the currency’s stumble has been rather muted compared with the big interest-rate defense seen in other countries with wide current-account deficits like Indonesia. “While the Reserve Bank of India has been intervening in the FX market, the size of recent intervention looks to be less compared to before,” Khoon Goh, head of research at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore, said Monday.
The RBI net sold $1.9 billion of foreign currency in July to support the rupee, data Tuesday showed. This week’s currency selloff, which has nudged the rupee toward 73 per dollar, has led to an increase in chatter on the possible steps likely from the central bank, including raising money from overseas Indians.
The depreciation has more or less accounted for the overvaluation seen in the past two-to-three years, according to Kotak Mahindra Bank. The rupee has slid about 15 percent against the dollar from the taper-tantrum period in 2013, significantly less than other big emerging markets, the lender said in a note.
“On REER basis, the INR remains overvalued against long-term average though it has come down from its highs,” economists Suvodeep Rakshit and Upasna Bhardwaj wrote.
The rupee is Asia’s worst-performing currency this year, and its one-month volatility is at levels last seen in 2015, data compiled by Bloomberg show."

VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (Reuters) - Russian Economy Minister Maxim Oreshkin said on Wednesday the ruble has ""seriously deviated"" from fundamental value but he expected it to firm to 63-64 rubles to the U.S. dollar in December this year.
Earlier this week the ruble touched 70.60 per U.S. dollar , its weakest since mid-March 2016, extending the losses that started in early August with the threat of more U.S. sanctions against Moscow. 
Officials, including some from the finance ministry, have said they had a wide range of tools to be used in case of high market volatility.
So far the tools had not been necessary and there was no need to make exporters sell foreign exchange to support the ruble, officials have said. 
""Currently, there is a deviation from the fundamental (exchange rate) level...It can last for a quite prolonged period,"" Oreshkin said on Wednesday.
The ruble floated freely and was influenced by a number of factors including sanctions and capital outflows, Oreshkin said on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum in the Russian Pacific town of Vladivostok.
The economy ministry this month lowered its 2018 economic growth forecast to 1.8 percent from 1.9 percent and to 1.3 percent from 1.4 percent in 2019 amid mercurial markets, faster capital outflows and pessimism over the possibility of new U.S. sanctions. 
""We don't expect any big positive surprises from the third and fourth quarter (in terms of economic growth),"" Oreshkin said. ""It is due to the increased unpredictability, higher volatility on the financial markets.""
Oreshkin said he did not expect economic growth to exceed 1.9 percent in the last two quarters of 2018. 
The Russian central bank's board meets on Friday to decide its key interest rate, with analysts expecting the rate to be held steady, with the central bank sending a hawkish signal in its statement to calm down markets. 

Oreshkin said on Wednesday that annual inflation this year may exceed his forecast of 3.4 percent if the ruble exchange rate remains at current levels. The central bank's inflation target is 4 percent.

On Wednesday, the PBOC set the reference rate for the yuan at 6.8546 compared to 6.8488 on Tuesday.
After taking a 15-day break from open market operations, on Wednesday the People's Bank of China injected CNY60 billion of liquidity.
The yuan has been sliding against the US dollar since April and has lost more than 9% since then. A weaker yuan could lessen, to a degree, the impact of trade tariffs that the U.S. has Imposed and the further tariffs that U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened.
Speaking on Tuesday during the Easter Economic Forum (EEF) in Vladivostok, Russia, former PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said the U.S. use of too many financial sanctions could drive people to the yuan.
Trump has threatened to impose sanctions on virtually all Chinese exports to the U.S. with sanctions on $200 billion worth of goods having already gone through public consultations and sanctions on another $267 billion threatened after that.
While sanctions could make Chinese products more expensive in the U.S., a weaker yuan could make them cheaper.
The USD/CNY pair was trading at 6.8742, up 0.03% at 11:00 PM ET (GMT 03:00).
The PBOC and other agencies have been taking steps to support the yuan. In August, the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) reintroduced a counter-cyclical factor in setting the value of the currency after a 5% plunge over two months.
The Japanese yen gained some ground on Wednesday morning against the dollar, with the USD/JPY pair down 0.17% to 111.46. On Sept. 10, Japan reported accelerated growth in the second quarter. The Japanese economy grew at an annualized 3% in the second quarter, the fastest pace in two years.
The Australian dollar gave up some ground Wednesday morning. The AUD/USD trade was down 0.29 to 0.7099.
The fall in the Indian rupee against the dollar continued. The USD/INR pair was up 0.21% to 72.705. The rupee has lost about 12% against the dollar this year.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.10% to 95.22, from a session low of 94.84.
The U.S. Labor Department's latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTs) report, a measure of labor demand, showed job openings in August improved to about 6.939 million, beating expectations of 6.646 million.
The surge in job openings to the highest level since 2000, pointing to underlying strength in the U.S. economy, added to the narrative that the United States would fare better in a trade war with China that looks set to intensify.
China plans to ask the World Trade Organization (WTO) it wants to impose $7 billion a year in sanctions on the United States, citing Washington’s non-compliance with a ruling in a dispute over U.S. dumping duties.

Beijing will formally place the request next week, as an apparent response to remarks from Trump. Chinese officials had previously stated they would retaliate on any trade moves from Washington.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro rose on Tuesday as easing concerns about Italian debt boosted the single currency for a second day, while broader moves in forex markets were contained as investors fretted about the next developments in the Sino-U.S. trade dispute.
Sterling was the big mover elsewhere, rallying to a fresh five-week high above $1.30 after the European Union chief negotiator's comments on Monday on the prospects of a Brexit deal underpinned demand for the pound. 
Markets remain nervous about any U.S. move to slap fresh duties on Chinese goods amid heightened tension between the two economic giants, and after further falls in emerging market asset prices into early European trading hours. 
The euro, however, was buoyed by a fall in Italian government borrowing costs this week after Economy Minister Giovanni Tria on Monday predicted yields would drop as the government lays out its much-anticipated budget for 2019. 
The euro rose 0.4 percent to $1.1644 (EUR=) while the dollar index was left down 0.3 percent at 94.895 (DXY), close to its lowest since late August. 
""It seems to be a mixture of cautious sentiment toward the emerging markets, relief following positive comments on the part of the Italian Ministry of Finance about the Italian budget deficit and government debt, concerns about possible new U.S. tariffs on Chinese products and uncertainty ahead of the ECB meeting on Thursday,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Antje Praefcke said.
Policymakers at the European Central Bank are widely expected to leave their policy settings unchanged on Thursday.
BREXIT BOOST
Monday's reports that Michel Barnier, the EU's top negotiator, told a forum in Slovenia that it was ""realistic"" to expect a Brexit deal in six to eight weeks helped send the pound sharply higher to $1.3052 , its highest level since Aug. 2.
It built on those gains on Tuesday, rising to as high as $1.3087.
Barnier's comments were seized on by markets as a signal the UK may avoid a disorderly no-deal Brexit. Sterling has been under pressure on worries that Britain would exit from the EU without any formal trading agreement.
""If the negotiations for Brexit go well it naturally becomes a tailwind for the pound,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities. ""If Britain achieves Brexit without problems, the advantages for the European Union are big as well.""

The rupee slid as much as 1.3 percent Monday to a new low of 72.6738, leading losses among Asia’s emerging-market currencies. Sustained weakening has prompted authorities to ask the central bank to intervene more aggressively to support the currency, people familiar with the matter said.
“While the Reserve Bank of India has been intervening in the FX market, the size of recent intervention looks to be a lot less compared to before,” said Khoon Goh, head of research at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore. “The rupee’s continued decline stems from dollar strength and concerns over India’s external position.”
State-owned lenders were seen selling dollars, possibly on behalf of the central bank, around 72.50-72.65 levels in early trading, Mumbai-based traders said. The banks were subsequently not seen intervening heavily, they said. The rupee closed down 1 percent to 72.4575 per dollar.
The rupee has been roughed up in the past month amid a selloff sweeping emerging markets following a rout in the currencies of Argentina and Turkey. The currency has set a string of record lows, dampening some of the optimism about India’s world-beating economic growth that sent the local stock market to record highs last month. The weakness is credit negative for companies which generate revenue in rupees but rely on U.S. dollar debt to fund their operations, Moody’s Investors Service said Monday.
The government is conscious about the rupee’s slump, and the central bank is intervening when needed, a finance ministry official said, asking not to be identified citing rules. The government may take steps, including introducing a deposit plan for overseas Indians, to stem the selloff, the official said.
Oil Shortfall
The comments helped the rupee pare the day’s losses that were fueled in part by data that showed the current-account gap widened in the June quarter to $15.8 billion The benchmark yield climbed 13 basis points to 8.16 percent, the highest since 2014, while the 30-stock S&P BSE Sensex had its biggest drop since March.
The deficit represented 2.4 percent of gross domestic product, more than the 1.9 percent seen in the March quarter, according to the RBI. The worst may be yet to come as the oil import bill for the world’s fastest-growing oil user surged 76 percent in July from a year earlier to $10.2 billion.
The gap will probably widen to 2.5 percent of GDP for the year amid rising commodity prices and fund outflows, said Dhananjay Sinha, an analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services. He expects the rupee to weaken further to as low as 75 per dollar and sees the benchmark yield reaching 8.40 percent.
Global funds sold $601 million of India’s bonds this month, more than the combined $459 million that they bought in July and August. Concerns over an oversupply of sovereign bonds had contributed to the selldown earlier this year, and there are little signs of relief.
The right level for the rupee is 68-70 per dollar, with 72 being “perhaps an outer limit or beyond the reasonable outer limit for depreciation,” Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Garg told the Economic Times in an interview. “Those operators who are trying to take advantage of this contagion feeling in emerging markets may come to grief later,” he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar struggled against its rivals on Monday, especially against the Scandinavian currencies, as some investors took profits after a strong rally in recent weeks although strong U.S. data kept the pressure on emerging market currencies.
Against a basket of its rivals, the dollar was broadly flat at 95.36 (DXY) after rising 0.23 percent last week, its biggest rise in three weeks.
Its losses were more pronounced against the Swedish crown and the Norwegian crown against which it lost 0.1 and 0.6 percent respectively.
The Swedish crown  strengthened after gains for the nationalist and anti-immigration party Sweden Democrats party were smaller than some polls had predicted. 
A big negative driver for the Swedish crown before the election has been hedging activity against a strong showing by the Sweden Democrats, but the outcome avoided the worst of the market's fears even as the nation headed for a hung parliament.
""Sweden's election has left political gridlock in its wake, but the Sweden Democrats party made less progress than some had expected and that has triggered a relief rally,"" said Kit Juckes, a strategist at London's  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
The Norwegian crown  surged after August inflation data firmed expectations for a central bank rate hike next week.
Against the euro (EURNOK=D3), the crown rose 0.8 percent and was set for its biggest daily rise in more than four months at 9.70.
Overall dollar positions saw their biggest drop in nearly six months as investors took some profits from a rally that has seen the greenback gain more than 6 percent since trade concerns shot into the spotlight.

U.S. jobs growth accelerated in August and wages notched their largest annual increase in more than nine years, boosting the prospect of faster interest rate rises by the Federal Reserve.

With five of the seven already in a currency crisis or a program run by the International Monetary Fund, that leaves South Africa and Pakistan as the standouts.
At the same time, the eight countries with the lowest risk of a crisis are Brazil, Bulgaria, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Peru, Philippines, Russia and Thailand, according to analysts including Robert Subbaraman, Singapore-based head of emerging-markets economics.
“This is an important result,” they wrote in a note Monday. “As investors focus more on EM risk it is important not to lump all EMs together as one homogeneous group; Damocles highlights a long list of countries with very low risk of full-blown crises.”
Nomura’s findings are based on an early warning model -- called Damocles -- set up to identify exchange rate crises for 30 emerging economies. The model examines a variety of factors including foreign-exchange reserves, debt levels, interest rates and import cover.
It has predicted two-thirds of the 54 developing nation exchange-rate crises since 1996, up to 12 months in advance, according to the analysts.
“The results we have achieved are encouraging, but given the inherent limitations of any early warning system it would be foolish to make any exaggerated claims,” they said.

The drops in the US dollar followed a threat by U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday that he is considering significant additional tariffs on Chinese imports that could potentially cover the entirety of U.S. imports. The threat sent both the currency and equities down.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies, moved from losses to gains and was up 0.04% to 95.42 by 11:25PM ET (GMT 02:56). On Friday, all major equity indexes in the U.S. fell and Asian indexes were trading in the red Monday morning.
Trump threatened to impose tariffs on an extra $267 billion worth of Chinese products over and above tariffs on an $200 billion worth of Chinese goods for which public consultations have concluded. Trump said that the tariffs on the $200 billion of Chinese goods could “take place very soon, depending on what happens with them.”
The Chinese yuan weakened, with the USD/CNY pair rising 0.24% to 6.8612.
Down under, the Australian dollar hit a two-and-a-half-year low on Friday as the AUD/USD pair went up 0.01% to 0.7106, the first time the Australian dollar has traded below 71 US cents since February 2016.
The U.S. and China are Australia’s major trade partners. The ongoing trade dispute as well as the country's dependence on foreign investment have combined to push the currency lower.
“AUD broke below key technical levels on Friday and a test below $0.7 cannot be ruled out over the short term. Eyes will remain on trade headlines with any negative impacts to China likely to hurt AUD,” said Cherelle Murphy at ANZ. (Source)

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal wraps ""a suicide vest around the British constitution"" and hands the detonator to the European Union, former foreign minister Boris Johnson said in comments that drew strong criticism.
In an article in the Mail on Sunday newspaper, Johnson pressed his attack on May's so-called Chequers plan to leave the EU, calling it ""a humiliation"" that opens ""ourselves to perpetual political blackmail"".
May is under fire from all sides of the divisive Brexit debate, with Johnson, favorite to succeed her, leading a push by eurosceptic lawmakers for the government to ""chuck Chequers"" and pursue a clean break with the bloc. 
But so far, May has signaled she will not drop her blueprint for Britain's future ties with the bloc after Brexit - the biggest shift in the country's foreign and trade policy for almost half a century. 
""We have wrapped a suicide vest around the British constitution – and handed the detonator to (EU chief negotiator) Michel Barnier,"" Johnson wrote.
His words - particularly the reference to a suicide vest - drew condemnation from fellow members of the governing Conservative Party. 
Alan Duncan, a minister at the Foreign Office, said Johnson's comments marked ""one of the most disgusting moments in modern British politics"".
""For Boris to say that the PM's view is like that of a suicide bomber is too much,"" he said on Twitter. ""I'm sorry, but this is the political end of Boris Johnson. If it isn't now, I will make sure it is later.""
""NOT NEWS""
Johnson resigned as foreign secretary over the Chequers plan, named after May's country residence where the government agreed proposals to maintain close trade ties with the EU in July, and has attacked it as making Britain ""a vassal state"".
The prime minister's plans have also been criticized by EU supporters for offering the ""worst of all worlds"".
Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said her organization would back a second vote on Brexit if May failed to win a deal that supported workers.
But two ministers batted away Johnson's appeal for Britain to drop Chequers and negotiate a Canada-style trade deal instead, saying such an agreement would not solve the problem of a new border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.
""It is not news that he has a difference of opinion with the prime minister and that's why he left government,"" interior minister Sajid Javid told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. ""I think there are much better ways to articulate your differences.""
Housing minister James Brokenshire urged Conservatives to move forward with the Chequers plan, which May has failed so far to win backing from her party, Britain's parliament and also EU negotiators.
Many of Johnson's supporters hope his increasingly vocal criticism of May signals that he will launch a leadership bid while other Conservatives suggest his Mail article was solely to distract attention away from his marital difficulties.

On Friday, Johnson said he had separated from his wife Marina Wheeler and that the couple would divorce.

O'Grady, who leads the body which groups 48 trade unions, told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: ""We should extend Article 50 (which gives two years to negotiate an exit deal). We should focus on getting a deal that is actually good for this country and that means good for working people.

Speaking on the sidelines of Italy's annual Ambrosetti conference on European affairs, Lidington said London wanted a deal that satisfied all EU member states but its contingency plan for a 'no-deal' Brexit was well developed.
""We remain very much committed to getting a good deal and believing that that is not just the right outcome but the most probable outcome,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
He said it was important to wrap up negotiations by November in order to give British and European parliaments enough time to review and approve the text of any agreement.
""This is not something that can simply be left to the 11th hour,"" Lidington added.
The UK is due to leave the European Union on March 29, yet little is clear. If the world’s fifth largest economy leaves the EU without a detailed agreement, financial markets fear a chaotic divorce that would disrupt trade flows across Europe.
There is, so far, no full exit deal, rivals to Prime Minister Theresa May are circling and some lawmakers are pushing for a rerun of the 2016 referendum.
May recently outlined proposals on economic and trade policy in a white paper, which Lidington said would ensure frictionless trade, especially across the UK's only post-Brexit land border with the EU, between Ireland and Northern Ireland.

But EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has criticized the proposals, saying they imply Britain wants a ""kind of à la carte single market, a kind of cherrypicking approach"".

The Federal Reserve's view that a tighter labor market would lead to wage growth, increasing inflationary pressures, was validated somewhat as average hourly earnings grew 0.4%, topping economists' forecast for a 0.3% increase.
With a quarter-point rate hike already baked in for the Sept. 25-26 meeting, the stronger average hourly earnings print lifted expectations for rate hikes further out the curve. BofA Merrill Lynch said it expects three more increases next year following Fed hikes later this month and in December.
""The labor market may have reached a point where limited labor supply is finally starting to put meaningful upward pressure on wages,"" the bank said.
The dollar's surge forced the pound to give up strong gains, which had followed reports that the UK parliamentary transcripts showed European Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier was ""open to discussing other backstops"" concerning the Irish border issue, easing expectations of the UK leaving the EU without a trade deal.

Reserves declined by $8.2 billion to $3.110 trillion in August, the People’s Bank of China said Friday. That compares with $3.118 trillion the previous month and the median forecast of $3.115 trillion in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
The nation’s reserve holdings, the world’s biggest, have shown small fluctuations in value this year as capital control measures remain in place and the PBOC refrains from direct intervention on the yuan. In August, the PBOC used multiple policy tools to support the currency and stabilize market sentiment, implementing a reserve requirement on foreign exchange forward trading and a counter-cyclical factor in the daily pricing of the currency.
“There were worries in the market that a weak yuan could trigger capital outflows,” said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING Bank NV in Hong Kong. “Capital outflow channels are managed by the authorities, and the capital account of China has not ever been freely open.”
""These policy steps alleviated yuan depreciation pressures and foreign exchange outflows,"" according to a report by China International Capital Corp analyst Liu Liu in Beijing, ""Foreign exchange reserves will likely remain largely stable."""

LONDON (Reuters) - The Australian dollar fell to its weakest level in more than 2-1/2 years on Friday as fears over an escalation in the trade conflict between the United States and China dominated concerns while safe haven currencies such as the franc and yen gained.
With a public comment period for proposed U.S. tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese imports ending at 0400 GMT, markets edged lower as investors waited for a fresh salvo to be fired in the ongoing Sino-U.S. trade war.
Ulrich Leuchtmann, a currency strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt said broad concerns were giving a boost to safe-haven currencies and markets will remain focused on trade war headlines than upcoming U.S. economic data unless there is a big downward surprise.
An emerging market currency index (MIEM00000CUS) edged higher on Friday but is poised to register its biggest weekly loss in three weeks.
Among developed currencies, the Australian dollar fell more than half a percent to its lowest level since Feb 2016 at $0.7138 as concerns that any escalation in trade conflict would hit export-oriented economies such as Australia hard which consider China as their biggest trading partner.
The yuan was relatively stable in the offshore market  in Hong Kong as a spike in overnight borrowing costs deterred short sellers of the Chinese currency.
The U.S. currency held in relatively tight ranges against other major peers such as the euro and pound, with the market bracing for the highly anticipated U.S. jobs report due later in the session.
August U.S. non-farm payrolls report is due at 1230 GMT. The U.S. economy is expected to have added about 191,000 jobs in August, with average earnings at 0.2 percent month-on-month compared to 0.3 percent from July.

China's commerce ministry has said the country would retaliate if the U.S. imposes new tariffs.

410,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 10:40PM ET</span>",Fitch Sees Emerging-Market Contagion Easing as Investors Pause,"(Bloomberg) -- The emerging-market rout that started in Argentina and Turkey, then spread to India and Indonesia and other nations, will probably stay contained, according to Fitch Ratings.
While contagion from the broader selloff is apparent in financial markets, the consensus among investors is that tumult in developing nations will subside, according to Fitch’s global head of sovereign ratings. The company maintains stable outlooks for all Asian emerging markets, aside from Pakistan.
“The discussion around contagion has changed over time -- people are less focused on it than in previous crisis episodes,” James McCormack, Fitch’s global head of sovereign ratings, said in an interview at a conference hosted by the company in New York. He defined contagion as an irrational sale of a nation’s assets based on developments elsewhere.
About 43 percent of survey respondents at the conference said they would hold positions during the turmoil . About 30 percent said it makes sense to cut exposure on worsening contagion, while 26 percent said the selloff was overdone and presents a buying opportunity.
The economies of India and Indonesia have adequate buffers and their governments have made appropriate policy responses to be able to weather the emerging-market rout, according to Stephen Schwartz, the head of Fitch’s Asia-Pacific sovereign team.
And while Argentina’s peso selloff has dragged down other Latin American currencies, the broader economic impact has been limited so far, according to Todd Martinez, director of Latin America sovereigns.
Looking ahead, the rising U.S. dollar poses a challenge for developing nations that have sold large amounts of dollar debt and are vulnerable to declining commodity prices.
“The dollar is the single most important variable across the emerging-market universe,” McCormack said. “That’s been the case for many, many years, and what markets are telling us now is it’s still the case.”"
411,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 06:50PM ET</span>",The Australian Dollar Is Acting Like an Emerging-Market Currency,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s dollar is finding itself in unusual company these days, getting sold along with former emerging-market darlings such as the Indonesian rupiah and Indian rupee.
As a rout grips developing markets, the Aussie -- viewed as a barometer for global risk appetite -- is also bearing the brunt of investor angst. While nobody’s expecting the currency to be swept up in full-fledged contagion, it is being battered due to the economy’s close ties to China and reliance on offshore funding.
“Australia’s economic growth has become more highly linked to the Asia region through commodities, services and as a source of capital,” said Greg Gibbs, founder of Amplifying Global FX Capital Pty. “So the Aussie is used as a proxy trade for risks for the region, even if they have not materialized in weaker growth in Australia or lower commodity prices.”
The Aussie’s fall from grace -- it was trading at parity to the U.S. dollar as recently as 2013 -- is the flip side of previous gains that were fueled by years of record Chinese demand for its commodities. Australia’s currency is also suffering along with emerging-market assets as global funds withdraw in favor of returning to the greenback.
The Aussie has slumped 3 percent in the past month, and this week dropped to 71.45 U.S. cents, the lowest since May 2016. Indonesia’s rupiah is down a similar amount, while the Indian rupee has tumbled more than 4 percent.
Still, the drivers of the recent declines differ to some extent. While emerging-market currencies have been pummeled by contagion fears from the financial turmoil in Turkey and Argentina, Australia’s dollar has been dented by the impact of tighter global liquidity on its banks.
Liquidity Tightens
Three-month funding costs have risen almost 9 percent this year, and three major Australian banks have pushed up mortgage rates, spurring concerns this will damp economic growth and make it even less likely that the Reserve Bank of Australia will raise interest rates.
“The key links are that Australian banks rely on offshore funding for a significant part of their books,” said Gibbs, who previously worked at the RBA’s foreign-exchange desk. “We can see some of the direct effects of tightening global liquidity via a moderate uptick in Australian bank funding costs and some lift in mortgage rates.”
The next risk factor for the Aussie will come from a possible escalation of the U.S.-China trade war. With the public comment period for new American tariffs on Chinese goods ending on Thursday, the expectations is that U.S. President Donald Trump will impose additional duties soon.
China buys more than a third of Australia’s exports -- equivalent to about 8 percent of the South Pacific nation’s gross domestic product. The dependence helped drive the correlation between the Aussie and the offshore yuan to the strongest on record last month.
“China has always had an outsized impact on AUD due to China being Australia’s main export partner,” said Marcus Wong, who was the most accurate forecaster for the Aussie in Bloomberg’s second-quarter rankings. “As an instrument to express risk-off sentiment, the Aussie has been hit not just by rising protectionism concerns but also EM worries as well.”
The Aussie will probably extend losses to 70.60 cents soon, said Wong, a treasury strategist at CIMB Bank Bhd. in Singapore.

On Sept. 4, the bank sold $358 million of the $650 million traded on the peso spot market, roughly 55 percent of the volume, as it sought to prop up the peso. Traders say it’s become essentially the only participant offering hard currency.

To put it into perspective, the last time Brazil’s central bank intervened in the FX market on Aug. 30, it sold $1.5 billion using derivatives in a session that saw total volume in that specific market of almost $38.9 billion. The intervention accounted for only 3.9 percent of the total.
The lack of liquidity in the peso also means that spreads on bid and offers have widened, further convincing traders to stay on the sidelines. The spread reached almost 3.5 pesos last week, the most in at least three months, based on data from the Buenos Aires MAE electronic trading platform. The peso gained for a second day Thursday, rising 1.3 percent as of 1:23 p.m. in Buenos Aires.
""The market is operating with very low volume, without the hysteria of the previous days, but with too few trades to be considered representative,"" said Gustavo Quintana, a currency trader at PR Corredores de Cambio in Buenos Aires.Traded volume has slumped as the peso tumbled 51 percent in the year to date. A rout that began in April intensified last week after President Mauricio Macri said he was looking to speed up disbursements from a $50 billion credit line with the International Monetary Fund. The announcement, combined with accelerating inflation and the prospect of a recession this year, spooked investors and led to a 16 percent drop in the peso last week alone.
The central bank Wednesday sold dollars directly in the market in addition to a $100 million intervention through an auction.
""Liquidity is improving slightly, but on Tuesday it could have been considered a broken market with scarce activity in the month,"" said Alejandro Cuadrado, Latin America FX strategist at BBVA (MC:BBVA) in New York. ""The conclusion is that it’s too early to say that it has stabilized.""
So what’s next for the Argentine peso? Investors are watching for clues from negotiations in Washington D.C., where government and central bank representatives are meeting with IMF Director Christine Lagarde and her team to revise the original agreement. That will be the next catalyst to help anchor short-term expectations for the peso, Cuadrado said.
""From then on we can talk about rebuilding the market and reducing volatility,"" Cuadrado added. ""But it’s hard to see flows returning significantly. Appetite on dollar-bonds is trickling in, but appetite for the ARS will remain limited.""

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.01% to 95.06.
A deluge of mixed economic U.S. data showed services activity remained robust, factory orders were off the pace and weakness in the private labor market, leaving investors with little conviction to back the dollar.
On the labor market front, private payrolls grew by 163,000 in August, a decline from the 217,000 in July, according to a report released Wednesday by ADP and Moody's Analytics. That missed economists’ forecast of 188,000.
The weaker ADP print comes a day ahead of the all-important nonfarm payrolls report, with economists' expecting that the U.S. economy churned out about 191,000 jobs in August.
The Commerce Department, meanwhile, said factory orders slipped 0.8% in July month, missing economists' forecasts for a 0.6% decline.
ISM nonmanufacturing data for August showed an uptick to 58.5, beating expectations for a reading of 57.0. The services sector is critical component of the U.S. economy, accounting for roughly 80% of U.S. private-sector GDP.
The dollar was also kept in check by a both sterling and yen strength as the latter attracted safe-haven demand on concerns the U.S.-China trade war could intensify.
Trump could impose levies on $200 billion more of Chinese imports on Thursday when a public comment period on the new tariffs ends.

As they clock up gains along with the U.S. dollar, what’s remarkable is how long it took them.
The Swiss franc turned positive for the year on August 29, and now is up 0.4 percent. After peaking in March, the Japanese yen weakened steadily until bottoming out on July 17. It’s currently up 1.2 percent for the year.
Strong U.S. growth data and higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve have kept the yen and the Swiss franc from rallying more substantively, analysts from Rabobank wrote in a Sept. 5 report. That’s in spite of an emerging market sell-off that’s seen investors take cover from volatility spreading from Indonesia to Turkey to Argentina.
“We expect that over the long term that the JPY and the CHF will remain investors’ safe havens of choice,” the analysts wrote. “In the short term we would also expect that any negative shock to the market is also likely to result in a sudden JPY and CHF outperformance.”
There’s been no shortage of market turmoil this year lending strength to the greenback which has posted a 2.2 percent gain in the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index during the same period.
Conspicuously absent from the list of putative havens is gold bullion, which has sunk 7.6 percent year-to-date.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar sagged on Thursday as the pound led a bounce in European currencies, although skittish emerging market currencies and global trade concerns limited the greenback's losses.
The Australian dollar also dipped, failing to draw support from slightly better-than-expected domestic trade data.
The catalyst behind the dollar's fall was the pound, which spiked after Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that the United Kingdom and Germany were prepared to drop a key sticking point in Brexit negotiations.

420,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 09:20PM ET</span>","U.S. dollar to keep currency crown this year, but not next: Reuters poll","By Hari Kishan
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar, which has had its best yearly performance since 2015 so far in 2018, will hold on to those gains for the rest of the year but beyond that is unlikely to maintain its ascendancy, a Reuters poll showed.
A majority of foreign exchange strategists in Reuters polls since the dollar's resurgence in April had predicted a reversal in its fortunes, with the upward trend not expected to last more than three months. But the current rally has outlasted those expectations.
Still, the latest poll of over 50 strategists taken Aug 31- Sept 5 showed the dollar, up over 3 percent this year, would reverse that trend with most currencies - including battered emerging market currencies - forecast to gain in a year's time.
That thinking is driven by expectations that U.S. economic growth momentum has peaked as well as the fact that many of the things underpinning the dollar - ranging from expected Federal Reserve interest rate hikes to the U.S.-China trade dispute - have now been priced in.
""The substantial U.S. dollar rally was not widely expected, even within the context of looking over the past long-term downtrend in the dollar against major currencies. It has definitely gone on for long and has been a surprise based on the length and magnitude of this corrective bounce in the dollar,"" said Nick Bennenbroek, head of FX strategy at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).
""But over time, once the fiscal stimulus eventually fades ... we do expect the dollar to soften over time and there are indications that it might be getting closer to the end.""
While there has been no let-up in the trade wrangling between the United States and China, with President Donald Trump set to ramp up tariffs on more Chinese imports, the dollar's performance over the past month has been mixed.
Currency speculators reduced bets in favor of the U.S. currency in the latest week for the first time in 11 weeks, after net long dollar positions hit a more 1-1/2-year high the previous week.
Still, the latest poll showed the U.S. currency is not likely to fall in the near-term. Indeed, the median probability of a dollar correction of 5 percent or more by year-end was only 20 percent, according to responses to an additional question. 
""The dollar is overvalued and the Fed isn't doing anything to send it higher, but that's enough for it to remain top dog in currency markets in the absence of good news elsewhere,"" noted Kit Juckes, global head of FX strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
""The 'winner' is the currency that doesn't lose. And right now, that's still the dollar. There's not much to make me think the dollar should be going up, but there's plenty to make me nervous about other currencies.""
In a year's time, though, the euro, which is down more than 3 percent against the dollar this year, is forecast to gain 4 percent to $1.21 from around $1.16 on Wednesday.
Sterling will gain around 6 percent against the dollar in a year, but expectations for that rise are conditional upon Britain leaving the European Union with a deal, which is not certain. [GBP/POLL]
The Japanese yen, which is also considered a safe bet during times of economic distress, is forecast to gain over 2 percent against the dollar in a year.
""USD remains supported across the board due to market fears about a U.S.-led global trade war, a booming U.S. economy and continuing Fed policy normalization – all of which underscore the appeal of the currency,"" noted strategists at CA-CIB.
""Over the long term, we anticipate renewed USD underperformance on the back of a flatter U.S. Treasury yield curve, concerns about the U.S.'s deteriorating twin deficits and the diminishing positive growth impact from President Trump's fiscal stimulus.""

421,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 09:00PM ET</span>","Sterling to float up around 6 percent in a year, but no-deal Brexit would sink it: Reuters poll","By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling will make solid gains on the dollar in the coming year, a Reuters poll found, but that climb is based on the assumption that Britain leaves the European Union next year with a deal.
Median forecasts in the Aug.31-Sept 5 poll of 50 foreign exchange specialists put cable  at $1.28 in a month, $1.32 in six and $1.37 in year - which would mark around a 6 percent rise from where it was trading on Wednesday.
But that still won't be where it was before the June 2016 referendum and those forecasts were weaker than ones given just a month ago, highlighting market doubts as a deadline approaches for when the two sides want to have thrashed out a deal.
""Our high conviction view remains that a deal will be reached ... we think this will take GBP/USD back above the $1.30 level and toward $1.35,"" said Kamal Sharma at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
But the pound will instead fall 8 percent in the immediate aftermath if Britain leaves the EU without a deal in March 2019, the median forecast from an extra question suggested. The most pessimistic response was for a 15 percent slide.
""If the negotiations should collapse, or if the agreement is rejected by some EU country or by the UK Parliament − causing the UK to leave the EU without an agreement next year − there is a risk that the pound will depreciate dramatically, especially against the dollar,"" analysts at SEB told clients.
Still, a separate Reuters poll earlier this week gave only a one-in-four chance of a no-deal Brexit - despite there being less than two months before the UK and EU are hoping to agree on the terms of Britain's departure with the two sides still looking a long way apart. [ECILT/GB]
""The risks to our forecasts are tilted to the downside,"" said Valentin Marinov at CA-CIB, who has already revised down his forecasts. 
""While our central case remains that the EU and the UK will eventually arrive at a mutually beneficial and business-friendly trade deal, chances are this will come only after a period of heightened political uncertainty and growing fears about a no-deal Brexit."" 
The uncertainty was also reflected in the range of forecasts, between $1.20 and $1.41 in six months time - around when Brexit is due to happen - and $1.2258 to $1.51 in a year.
Soon after Brexit happens, the Bank of England is expected to raise its Bank Rate by 25 basis points to 1.0 percent, offering some support to the pound, but then hold off on any further moves until 2020.
The United States Federal Reserve has been steadily raising borrowing costs since late 2015, which alongside investors seeking safety in U.S. assets on concerns over the impact of trade tariffs, has lent support to the dollar.
So with those factors already priced in, any further dollar rise is expected to be limited. [EUR/POLL]
Against the common currency, the pound (EURGBP=) will move little, which has been the case for a long while. In a month, one euro will get you 90.0 pence, in six months 89.0 pence and in a year 88.0 pence, not far from the 89.6p it was at on Wednesday.

The European Central Bank, which plans to end its 2.6 trillion-euro stimulus program this year, is expected to raise its interest rates in the quarter after the BoE does. [ECILT/EU]

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Chinese yuan will trim only some of its recent losses against the dollar over the coming year, with the People's Bank of China increasingly likely to intervene to support the currency against a still-rampant dollar, a Reuters poll found.
Trading in the partly-managed yuan, which has lost about 5 percent since the start of the year, was volatile this week amid threats that U.S. President Donald Trump could impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods worth $200 billion.
But in the last few weeks, China's central bank stepped in to support the currency and avoid heavy capital outflows, strengthening the yuan by about 1.5 percent against the greenback from its weakest level this year on August 15.
""Chinese authorities, having allowed the yuan to weaken in response to the trade escalation, have now signaled that they are unwilling to let the currency slide further beyond the 6.95–7.00 level last seen in late 2016,"" noted Khoon Goh, Head of Asia Research at ANZ.
""In the past, the authorities have been successful in eventually turning yuan weakness around. Trade tension is unresolved and the PBoC is likely to further support growth. But even with this, the signal the PBoC is sending suggests the yuan could be due for a rebound in the near-term.""
The yuan  is expected to gain 1 percent to 6.77 per dollar in a year, according to the poll of over 50 foreign exchange strategists taken Sept 3-5 from around 6.84 late on Wednesday. 
However, 18 of 40 common contributors have now revised their forecasts to a weaker yuan compared with a poll taken last month, citing the risk that global trade tensions worsen. 
Thirteen of them kept their projections unchanged and the remaining 9 revised them to reflect a stronger currency. 
Nine strategists see the yuan weakening to 7 to the dollar or higher at some point over the 12-month period, two more than in the poll taken one month ago. 
The PBoC has taken multiple steps to arrest the sharply-depreciating yuan by making the currency expensive for investors to bet on, helping to ease market speculation in a bid to avoid a repeat of the shock devaluation of the renminbi seen in 2015.
One of the measures the PBoC undertook to shore up the yuan was to reintroduce the 'counter-cyclical factor' to its daily fixing mechanism at the end of August. This would allow investors to trade 2 percent above or below the daily reference rate set by the central bank.
Following this, bearish bets on the renminbi were sharply reduced, a separate Reuters survey showed. [ASIA/FXP]
""We are fairly bearish on the U.S. dollar over the near-term and see weakness in the yuan as a multi-reflection of dollar strength,"" said Erik Nelson, currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and the top forecaster for Asian currencies in 2017. 
""In the very near-term the Chinese currency is out of the woods, but I think by early next year we will see a decisive recovery in the yuan and decisive resumption of greenback weakness."" 
But the wider Reuters foreign exchange poll found the U.S. dollar, which has had its best run so far this year since 2015, will hold on to the gains until December and not beyond. [EUR/POLL]
Still, the 12-month forecast for the yuan was the most pessimistic median in Reuters polls conducted this year.
Several currency strategists said renewed pressure on the yuan is inevitable as the Sino-U.S. trade war escalates, threatening to put more pressure on China's already cooling economy. [ECILT/CN]
Seventeen of 50 participants said the yuan will weaken below the current level of 6.84 in a year with the most pessimistic forecast expecting it to fall to 7.30, a level not seen since last financial crisis.
Policy tightening from the U.S. Federal Reserve and rising Treasury yields could affect the yuan's stability.
""The prospect of a new trade war could hurt China's export competitiveness and the PBoC is loosening monetary policy to cope with credit contraction. So I don't deny for a moment that yuan will face depreciation pressure,"" said Li Yishuang, FX analyst at China Securities in Beijing.

""The chance of yuan falling below 7 in the short-term is low, but in the long-term, the movement will depend on dollar index.""

425,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",Russian Rate Hike in Play as Ruble Revs Up Inflation at Last,"(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s central bank is setting the stage for an increase in interest rates as a weakening ruble fans inflation.
Just five months after it stopped easing monetary policy, the Bank of Russia raised the prospect of its first hike in borrowing costs since 2014. The country’s latest bout of currency weakness is combining with a worsening outlook for inflation as the rout in emerging markets showed no sign of letting up.
While a round of U.S. sanctions in April touched off an even bigger decline in the ruble than last month, the fallout is proving harder to contain this time. Data due as early as Wednesday will show inflation reached an annual 3.1 percent in August, the fastest in a year, according to the median of 14 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.
The ruble was among the four worst performers in emerging markets in August with a drop of more than 7 percent against the dollar. It’s lost a further 1 percent in September, trading 0.3 percent weaker as of 1:50 p.m. in Moscow. The central bank has estimated that each 10 percent decline in its value could add a percentage point to price growth.
“In April, some businesses could have refrained from passing on the ruble’s weakness onto consumers amid still-weak demand, and instead sacrificed part of their margin,” said Tatiana Evdokimova, chief economist for Russia at Nordea Bank. “But going forward, it will be hard to cut the margin further.”
Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina said Tuesday that there were factors in favor of raising rates at a meeting next week, even though most evidence still pointed toward leaving borrowing costs unchanged. For now, all 14 economists polled by Bloomberg predict the benchmark will be kept at 7.25 percent on Sept. 14. Still, a discussion over more drastic measures may be heating up.
“We are seeing that inflation is returning to our target slightly faster than we were earlier forecasting,” Nabiullina said. That’s “primarily because of external factors, the exchange-rate dynamics.”
The difference from April is also that a moderation in food prices through the summer months helped mask the ruble’s inflationary impact. The outlook for the rest of the year is far less favorable.
Adding to concern are plans to raise the value-added tax from Jan. 1, a move the Bank of Russia says may boost price growth by as much as 1.5 percentage points. The main impact is expected in the first quarter, when the central bank sees consumer-price growth temporarily exceeding its target of 4 percent. In July, annual inflation hit a high for 2018 even though it remains well below the goal.
Households’ inflation expectations for a year ahead, which the central bank calls a “pillar” of its rate decisions, rose in August to more than double the target. The share of Russians expecting the ruble to depreciate further is at the highest level since 2013, according to surveys conducted by inFOM on behalf of the central bank.
“Headline inflation is going to rise fast in the next few months,” said Tatiana Orlova, an economist at Emerginomics in London. “We have a pass-through from the weaker ruble and high global grain prices and an increase in local processed meat prices.”

426,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",Dollar rises on fears of new U.S. trade tariffs,"By Tom Finn
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rose broadly on Wednesday as concerns grew that U.S. President Donald Trump may soon ramp up a trade war with Beijing by imposing tariffs on more Chinese imports.
Trump could impose levies on $200 billion more of Chinese imports after a public comment period on the new tariffs ends on Thursday, though it is unclear how quickly that will happen.
Investors wary of the deadline stayed loyal to the safe-haven greenback on Wednesday and it rose against major currencies like the euro and the British pound.
The greenback also drew further support from upbeat U.S. indicators underlining the case for further interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the U.S. unit against a basket of six currencies, was up 0.1 percent at 95.442 as of 1100 GMT, not far off a two-week high of 95.737 reached during the previous session.
This year began with the dollar in retreat and investors convinced of further declines but now there appears to be very little to stop its ascent.
A crisis in the Turkish lira and the U.S.-China trade war have made the dollar a principal haven for investors seeking shelter and President Trump appears to be revelling in the strong dollar and its ability to bring pressure on his foes.
Since Tuesday, the dollar has gained more than 2 percent against the South African rand  and the Argentine peso , and more than 1 percent against Mexican and Colombian pesos.  
The greenback is up in 2018 against every major currency except the Mexican peso and Japanese yen. But some analysts believe the dollar may yet stumble before the year is out. 
""Cyclical forces will start to work against the dollar: relative economic momentum, relative monetary policy expectations and relative political uncertainty will start to exhibit similar dynamics that weighed on the dollar in the second half of 2017,"" said Viraj Patel, currency strategist at ING.
""Given the bleak global investment environment, we prefer to express our lower dollar versus majors view against safe-haven reserve currencies like the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc,"" Patel added. 
The Australian dollar , which had been languishing at its weakest levels since mid-2016, gained on Wednesday after Australia posted its best economic growth in six years.
It advanced 0.3 percent to $0.7196 moving off its lowest level since May 2016, reached during the previous session.
The euro (EUR=EBS) was 0.1 percent lower at $1.1597 and the British pound  was down 0.2 percent at $1.2827.
Emerging market currencies fell overnight as investors feared export-oriented economies would be caught in the crossfire of any escalating trade conflict. A JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) emerging market currency index (MIEM00000CUS) on Wednesday hovered near a 15-month low reached during the previous session.

""As long as the United States and China are quarrelling, it's easy for commodity prices to fall, and commodity and emerging market currencies are easily sold as well,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities.

427,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>","Canadian dollar to rally, say strategists betting on trade deal: Reuters poll","By Fergal Smith
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's dollar is likely to rally over the coming months, according to foreign exchange strategists in a Reuters poll, who forecast that trade uncertainty will fade and the Bank of Canada will continue to raise interest rates.
The latest poll of more than 35 market strategists taken Sept 1-4 predicted the Canadian dollar would rally to C$1.30 against the U.S. dollar, or about 77 U.S. cents, in three months, from nearly a seven-week low of C$1.32 on Tuesday.
The currency, which has weakened nearly 5 percent this year, is expected to reverse that trend and climb to C$1.26 in a year, matching the forecast of the August poll.
""At the end of the day we expect Canada to acquiesce to a trade deal, so that does remove some level of uncertainty,"" said Mazen Issa, a senior FX strategist at TD Securities. ""The problem, however, is timing.""
The loonie hit a nearly seven-week low on Tuesday at C$1.3208 after Canada and the United States ended talks last week to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement without reaching a deal. Canadian officials are due to resume talks with their U.S. counterparts on Wednesday.
Canada sends about 75 percent of its exports to the United States, so the economy is likely to suffer if a deal is not reached.
The Bank of Canada, which has worried that trade uncertainty will hold back business investment, will wait at least until October before raising interest rates again, according to a separate Reuters poll taken late last week.
The central bank has raised rates four times since July 2017, taking its policy rate to 1.50 percent from 0.50 percent.
""We are generally constructive on commodity prices and we do expect the Bank of Canada to tighten rates a little bit more relative to the (U.S.) Fed over the next 12 months,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank. ""Those two things, we think, should combine to give the CAD a bit of support, at least over that sort of time frame.""
The price of oil (CLc1), one of Canada's major exports, has rallied more than 15 percent this year. But industrial metals have been pressured by a trade dispute between the United States and China and investor worries that global growth will lose momentum.
Copper futures (HGc1) have fallen more than 20 percent since December.
Canada runs a current account deficit, so its economy depends on the global flow of capital.
Still, obstacles for the Canadian dollar, such as trade uncertainty, U.S. dollar strength and investor dislike of risk-sensitive currencies, could fade over time, said Erik Nelson, a currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).
""We think all three of those things are going to turn more favorable for the Canadian dollar in the six to 12 months or so,"" Nelson said.

At 0746 GMT, the ruble was 0.5 percent weaker against the dollar at 68.44  after briefly touching 68.59, a level last seen on Aug. 23. Versus the euro, the ruble shed 0.2 percent to 79.06 .
Geopolitical concern was in focus, after the Kremlin dismissed U.S. President Donald Trump's warning to Syria not to launch an offensive in the rebel-held enclave of Idlib, saying that the area was a ""nest of terrorism"".
The ruble could feel downside pressure from the situation in Syria as well as from the ""negative emotional background"" in other emerging markets, said Mikhail Poddubsky, an analyst at Promsvyazbank.
Russian assets also remained under pressure from concern about new U.S. sanctions, which could imposed restrictions on investment in new Russian sovereign debt.
But the ruble gained some support from the central bank after Governor Elvira Nabiullina indicated on Monday the board of directors would chose between holding and raising its key interest rate at the next rate-setting meeting, on Sept. 14.
Nabiullina's words shook the bond market where yields of 10-year government bonds, which move inversely to prices, rose to 8.87 percent (RU10YT=RR) for the first time since late 2016.
The market also keeps an eye on the finance ministry's plan to replenish its reserves under the so-called budget rule. In September, however, this plan would not envisage state buying of dollars on the market as the central bank said it won't resume daily FX purchases until October. 
Having supported Russian assets the day before, oil prices declined as a tropical storm near the U.S. Gulf coast weakened. Brent crude oil (LCOc1), a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was down 0.77 percent at $77.59 a barrel. 

Russian stock indexes went lower. The dollar-denominated RTS index (IRTS) lost 0.7 percent to 1,075.08 points, while its rouble-based peer MOEX (IMOEX) was 0.05 percent lower at 2,335.16 points.

The dollar was being offered for 150,000 rials, compared with about 138,000 rials on Tuesday, according to website Bonbast.com, which tracks the unofficial market. The website bazar360.com also quoted 150,000. Mesghal.online gave an exchange rate of 152,530.
The rial has lost more than two-thirds of its value this year because of a weak economy, financial difficulties at local banks and heavy demand for dollars among Iranians. Many fear the Washington's pulling out of a 2015 nuclear deal and renewed U.S. sanctions will cut into Iran’s exports of oil and other goods.
A set of U.S. sanctions targeting Iran’s oil industry is due to take effect in November.
Last week, Iran’s parliament sacked the minister of economic affairs and finance, the latest in a continuing shakeup of top economic personnel. In early August, Iranian lawmakers voted out the minister of labour and in July President Hassan Rouhani replaced the head of the central bank.
Protests linked to the tough economic situation erupted last December, spreading to more than 80 cities and towns and resulting in 25 deaths.

432,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>","EU Exploring Irish Backstop Options to Help May on Brexit, Source Says","(Bloomberg) -- European Union officials are exploring how to unlock a wider Brexit deal by making the so-called Irish border backstop more palatable to the U.K., according to a person familiar with deliberations.
In February, the EU laid out a detailed plan for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, a proposal that would effectively keep Northern Ireland in the bloc’s customs union and parts of the single market if needed. But that approach would amount to erecting a customs frontier between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain, which U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May says is unacceptable.
The EU accepts that its original version was heavy-handed and indicated a lack of trust in Britain, according to the person, who asked not be identified because deliberations are confidential and no formal alternative proposals have yet been tabled. Still, there’s no question of the bloc backing down on the principles behind the backstop.
Brexit Key
The search for a version of the backstop more politically acceptable to the U.K. is key to the entire Brexit process. The Irish question must be solved to allow the two sides to reach an accord on a withdrawal agreement and avert the risk of Britain crashing out of the bloc without a deal.
The U.K. side is also working on proposals to find a solution to the border problem. But May needs to keep her allies in the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party onside as without them she doesn’t have a majority in Parliament. For the DUP, any barriers between Northern Ireland and Britain would be unacceptable.
DUP lawmakers are getting suspicious about the concessions the U.K. government may be prepared to offer the EU. Bloomberg reported in July that one option being considered is keeping Northern Ireland aligned with some EU rules after Brexit and setting up regulatory checks -- but not a customs border -- between Northern Ireland and Britain. DUP lawmakers repeatedly questioned Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab on Tuesday as to whether there would be a regulatory border down the Irish Sea. Raab stopped short of ruling it out.
“We will not allow anything to be done that would threaten either the territorial or constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom,” he said.
Chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said he’s open to suggestions on how to solve the problem and in July said a way forward could be found. “We need to de-dramatize things,” he said.
The EU’s willingness to help May lies behind Barnier’s request last week for more detail from Britain on what crosses into Northern Ireland from the mainland, the person said. There may be many areas where there’s little trade, for example, which would mean those sectors would need minimal monitoring on an ongoing basis, the person said.
DUP Stance
A second area being explored is the circumstances under which the backstop would be triggered. If the EU and U.K. government can demonstrate that relatively few triggers for the backstop are in play, that may help sell it to the DUP.
Still, there’s a real risk the Northern Irish party will reject any form of a backstop, no matter how watered down, the person said.
While the Irish government still wants a backstop to ensure no border re-emerges after Brexit, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has also said he’s not “hung up” on the precise version of the legal text. What’s important is the outcome, he said.
Relatively little progress is expected in coming weeks, the person said, with only a cursory discussion on Brexit expected at an EU leaders summit in Salzburg, Austria, this month. November is a more realistic timeframe for a deal, according to the person.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar extended gains on Tuesday as concerns about a possible escalation in trade conflict between the United States and China prompted investors to dump emerging market currencies.
Against a basket of currencies (DXY), the dollar rose half a percent and was set for its biggest daily rise since Aug. 23 to 95.55. It hit its highest level in more than a year at 96.98 in mid-August.
The public comment period on a U.S. proposal for new tariffs on Chinese goods is set to end on Thursday, after which U.S. President Donald Trump can follow through on plans to impose tariffs on $200 billion more of Chinese imports, though it is unclear how quickly that will happen.
""The dollar seems to be the main defensive currency of choice as trade war concerns have picked up this week and that is causing problems for emerging markets,"" said Richard Falkenhall, a senior currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
Emerging market currencies came in for special punishment as investors feared these export-oriented economies would be caught in the middle of any escalating trade conflict. 
A JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) emerging market currency index (MIEM00000CUS) edged toward a more than one-year low hit in mid-August while the Indian rupee  plummeted to a record low. The Turkish lira  and the Mexican peso  fell by more than a percent each. 
""The general sentiment is that the dollar has not done too badly out of the trade war concerns, with concerns the U.S. might signal a fresh escalation in the trade conflict,"" said Kenneth Broux, an FX strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in London.
The U.S. dollar's status as the chief reserve currency makes it the primary beneficiary of concern over trade conflicts. 
It has gained nearly 7 percent since mid-April, when trade tensions first spilled into the limelight, and is set for its biggest daily rise in nearly two weeks.
On a positioning basis, markets are firmly in the stronger-dollar camp, with net outstanding positions holding just off the highest levels since January 2017, calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.
Though main Chinese stock benchmarks ended up more than 1 percent, underlying investor sentiment remained wary with Chinese state-run banks seen intervening to support the local currency.
Major currencies were also caught in the widening sell-off in emerging markets, with the euro (EUR=EBS) falling nearly half a percent at $1.1562 and the New Zealand dollar  dropping nearly one percent to a 2-1/2-year low.
Data this week also might lend further fuel to the dollar rally as U.S. investors return after a long weekend. U.S. August manufacturing ISM data is due later in the day and monthly payrolls data is scheduled for Friday.
The yen  rose 0.04 percent to 111.07 yen, giving up some gains after touching as high as 110.90. It was also higher against the euro, gaining about one-fifth of a percent to 128.84 yen (EURJPY=EBS).

The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, was up 0.05% to 95.12 by 1:45AM ET (05:45 GMT), while the Argentine peso hit a record low on Monday as President Mauricio Macri vowed to employ “emergency” measures to resolve the crisis.
Argentina announced on Monday new austerity measures with the ultimate goal of eventually balancing the budget by next year. These measures include new taxes on exports and further cuts to government spending. The Macri government wants to speed up the release of a $50 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Macri said poverty levels would rise as inflation rises to over 30%. The country raised interest rates to 60% in late August. “This is not just another crisis. It has to be the last,” he said.

441,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 03, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>",Turkey's Lira Needs More Than Intent to Raise Interest Rates,"(Bloomberg) -- The Turkish lira may have found its footing after the central bank signaled higher interest rates were around the corner, but some investors worry that any lasting relief will require a bold hike that it is loath to deliver.
Even after 700 basis points of monetary tightening since December, consumer-price growth has accelerated for five months, narrowing the inflation-adjusted policy rate to around 1 percent. Just to drive that back toward levels that afforded the lira some relative stability in June, the central bank would have to raise borrowing costs by another 400 basis points.
Central banks around the world have been pushed into action by emerging-market turmoil, with Argentina hiking rates by 1,500 basis points last week alone. Nomura International Plc says Turkey needs to raise its one-week repo rate by at least 575 basis points to 23.5 percent and it’s not clear policy makers will be prepared to deliver such aggressive tightening.
“It gives the feeling they are running out of ammunition,” said Guillaume Tresca, a strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA in Paris. “Market expectations are now running high for a bold rate hike. In our view, they can only disappoint markets,” he said, adding he saw the lira weakening to 8.30 per dollar by December.
The lira trimmed Monday’s loss against the dollar to trade around 6.64 on speculation hikes were on the way, after the central bank said it would take “necessary actions to support price stability.” The next policy meeting is on Sept. 13.
Considering the pressure from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to keep growth ticking along, it is no surprise that investor skepticism over the adequacy of any policy action is running high. By letting inflation run into the double digits for most of the last two years and relying on liquidity management instead of outright hikes the central bank has remained firmly behind the curve.
“I’m not very confident to say the least,” said Inan Demir, an economist at Nomura. “If Monday’s statement is a signal of unconventional policies, the market will be underwhelmed by the policy response.”

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar consolidated near a one-week high against a basket of currencies on Monday as tensions around global trade and a continued selloff in emerging markets fueled demand for the greenback.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday there was no need to keep Canada in the North American Free Trade Agreement and warned Congress not to meddle with the talks to revamp NAFTA or he would terminate the trilateral pact altogether.
""Trade tensions are broadly supporting the dollar, but the market is hardly very conducive of risk,"" said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING in London.
The U.S. currency's status as the chief reserve currency makes it the primary beneficiary of concern over trade conflicts. Traders have bought the dollar against the British pound  and the Canadian dollar  among others.
The dollar (DXY) was flat at 95.12 against a basket of major currencies, nearing its highest level since Aug. 27. It has gained nearly 7 percent since mid-April when trade tensions first arose.
On a positioning basis, markets are firmly in the stronger dollar camp, with net outstanding positions holding just off the highest levels since January 2017, calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.
Investors are also jittery about emerging markets, many of which are seeing an exodus of capital. Countries such as Argentina and Turkey are already in crisis, with the Argentine peso falling more than 4 percent on the day against the dollar and the Turkish lira losing 2 percent  .
Pressures are building elsewhere too, with the Indonesian rupiah hitting a 20-year low and the Indian rupee at a record low  
""It looks like we're going to see another week of dollar strength against EM ... Add in what should be a strong U.S. jobs report on Friday and we would expect dollar/EM to push further ahead,"" ING analysts told clients, referring to payrolls data due at the end of the week. 
The euro (EUR=EBS) slipped 0.11 percent against the dollar after data showed euro zone manufacturing growth slowing to a near two-year low in August as optimism dwindled due to the fears of an escalating global trade war.
Sterling was the standout loser of the day as new concerns about Brexit negotiations and weak UK manufacturing data combined to push the British currency down 0.8 percent.
Michel Barnier, the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator, said he was ""strongly opposed"" to the British government's proposals on future trade ties after it leaves the EU.
The pound  fell 0.8 percent to $1.2855 and weakened 0.8 percent against the euro (EURGBP=D3) to 89.80 pence.

447,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 02, 2018 10:30PM ET</span>","Goldman Sees Yuan Gaining in Reserves at Expense of Dollar, Yen","(Bloomberg) -- China’s currency is set to take an increasing share of world foreign-exchange reserves, with the dollar and yen having to make the most room proportionally for the newcomer on the block, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
An acceleration in foreign inflows into Chinese fixed income in recent months -- despite a tumble in the yuan -- has showcased the power of allocation demand for the world’s No. 3 bond market. Central banks will probably account for $250 billion of an estimated $1 trillion of net inflows into Chinese bonds in the five years through 2022, Goldman analysts said.
“Reserve re-allocations (i.e., outflows) could be more concentrated in dollars and yen,” analysts Danny Suwanapruti, Michael Cahill and Andrew Tilton wrote in a note Friday. Because central banks already hold the bulk of their reserves in dollars, the greenback is a natural funding source. “The rise in the renminbi’s prominence should impact the yen more since it will no longer be Asia’s only reserve currency,” they wrote, using another term for the yuan.
Along with reallocation from index-following asset managers that are set to respond to China’s inclusion in major global bond benchmarks, some $522 billion will come out of other markets into Chinese fixed income over five years, Goldman projects. For ease of analysis, that’s under the assumption of assets under management being static. A total of $1 trillion will flow in, including sovereign wealth funds and private fund managers, the bank said.
Outflows from Japan thanks to central banks and bond-index followers are estimated at $66 billion, which represents about 12 percent of foreign holdings of Japanese government bonds. The similar figure for U.S. bonds is $280 billion, though that only amounts to about 4 percent of foreign holdings of Treasuries, Goldman calculated.
China has been steadily opening its domestic markets to overseas investors, as part of a broader attempt to secure a stable exchange rate, given pent up demand among Chinese households and companies to put money overseas. Just last week, the State Council decided to exempt foreign institutions from some taxes.
The yuan’s share of global reserves, as identified in International Monetary Fund allocation estimates, “should rise to around 3 to 4 percent by the end of 2022,” the Goldman analysts wrote. “If financial markets deepen faster than we expect, then these estimates could prove to be too conservative. However, there are also a number of downside risks, including the fact that reserve allocation decisions tend to be rather ‘sticky.”’
For now, the outlook is for the yuan to remain below the pound and the yen in global reserves, Goldman concluded.

449,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>","Time for Currency Traders to Start Hedging Midterm Election, BofA Says","(Bloomberg) -- With the North American summer drawing to a close, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). strategists are urging investors to plan ahead for the U.S. midterm elections.
The bank recommends owning three-month dollar-yen implied volatility heading into November, when Democrats will attempt to wrest the House of Representatives and even the Senate from Republican control. Implied volatility in dollar-yen appears “cheap” relative to the rest of the Group-of-10 at the moment, and the yen’s flight-to-quality characteristics make it attractive heading into autumn’s risk events, according to FX strategists Alice Leng and Vadim Iaralov.
“U.S. election risk tends to be underpriced in FX historically, with a sizable rise in volatility around the election date,” they wrote in an Aug. 30 research note. Owning three-month dollar-yen vol is a way to “hedge against a mid-term election shakeup, potential deterioration of trade issues with China and fallout from North Korea denuclearization talks.”
Three-month implied volatility in dollar-yen currently sits at 7.35 percent, down from a peak of more than 10 percent back in February. Volatility in major developed-nation currencies remains below its one-year average, according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). gauge based on three-month at-the-money forward options.
The outcome in November could change that. Should Democrats retake both chambers of Congress or secure a large majority in the House, markets might begin to price in the possibility of a full Democratic sweep in 2020 -- when President Donald Trump is up for re-election -- and potentially the repeal of his tax-reform package. That would give way to much broader turmoil, the analysts wrote.
“Post-election, our biggest concern is whether a complacent market can handle a rise in volatility,” Leng and Iaralov said. “In those scenarios, volatility could rise significantly as policy uncertainty takes hold, an outcome that is being priced only as a tail scenario.”"

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's beleaguered peso stabilized on Friday as the central bank said it would auction a large amount of dollar reserves and the International Monetary Fund issued a strong statement of support for President Mauricio Macri's government.
With frustration rising over inflation of more than 30 percent and austerity measures required under a $50 billion IMF standby deal, members of the opposition Citizens' Unity party called for protests against Macri across the country on Friday evening.
The party's populist leader, former President Cristina Fernandez, may run against Macri for president next year, despite a graft scandal that has marked by the jailing of several of her former officials, further eroding confidence in the country's economy, Latin America's third largest. 
Macri is caught between voters tired of fiscal belt-tightening measures already implemented and investor pressure to unveil a package of further spending cuts austere enough to calm the markets. 
Many Argentines blame the IMF for imposing budget cuts that plunged millions into poverty during 2001-02 economic crisis.
The peso strengthened 3.5 percent in early Friday trade to 37.80 to the dollar after the central bank said it would auction $675 million in foreign reserves. It remains the world's worst performing currency so far this year.
""The peso is recovering thanks to the central bank actions,"" said Gustavo Quintana, a trader at local brokerage PR Corredores de Cambio.
The bank had offered $500 million per day over recent sessions. Through Thursday the peso had fallen more than 30 percent against the greenback in August.
Two-thirds of that drop came on Wednesday and Thursday after Macri said he would ask the IMF to advance disbursements under a $50 billion financing deal. The announcement raised alarms among investors that Argentina might be hard pressed to fund its 2019 deficit. 
""Argentina has the full support of the Fund and we are confident that the strong commitment and determination of the Argentine authorities will help the country overcome the current difficulties,"" IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said in a statement.
The backing expressed by the Fund helped the peso stabilize, at least temporarily, said Ignacio Labaqui, an analyst for New York consultancy Medley Global Advisors.
""IMF support is definitely helpful at this stage,"" he said.
SPENDING CUTS 
A policy package containing further government spending cuts is expected to be announced next week. But any more belt tightening will meet strong opposition, as discontent with Macri grows over high inflation, a weak economy and subsidy cuts that have jacked up household heating and water bills.
Several short-term general strikes have been called next month by leading labor groups protesting fiscal cuts.
With more austerity on the way, and utility prices set to rise again in the fourth quarter, low and middle income Argentines are hard-pressed to pay their monthly household costs. Yet fiscal tightening is exactly what the IMF and the markets want to see. 
""If the government fails to deliver a convincing austerity package, the peso will probably slide further and another large interest rate hike would be likely,"" consultancy Capital Economics said in a research note.
IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde, Fund staff and Finance Minister Nicolas Dujovne were scheduled to meet on Tuesday ""to advance the dialogue,"" Rice said.
Speaking to reporters on Thursday night, Dujovne said the government would announce a set of new economic measures on Monday, and would target a 2019 primary fiscal deficit below the 1.3 percent of gross domestic product agreed with the IMF.
Earlier that day, the currency closed at a record low 39.25 pesos per dollar. Also on Thursday the central bank hiked its monetary policy interest rate by 15 percentage points to a dizzying 60 percent, a move designed to fight inflation but that will shut down the already scarce amount of credit available to help businesses expand. 
Tens of thousands of people marched through downtown Buenos Aires on Thursday evening demanding higher budgets for public universities and higher salaries for university professors and staff. 
Protesters say salaries have been eroded by inflation that clocked in at an annual rate of 31.2 percent in July.

""In the context of the debate over the IMF's adjustment budget, we need to organize to change the economic path,"" said Vinesa Siley, a lawmaker in Argentina's lower house of Congress aligned with former populist leader Fernandez.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose for a second straight session on Friday on concerns about global trade conflict, this time between the United States and the European Union. 
On the week, however, the dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's value against six currencies was still down 0.3 percent. Over the last two weeks, the dollar has fallen 1.3 percent.

Trump also threatened in an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday to withdraw from the World Trade Organization if ""they don't shape up."" Those remarks dampened any positive sentiment following negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The cautious mood helped lift the yen against the dollar, which slipped 0.1 percent at 110.86 .
The Swiss franc rose for the sixth successive session versus the dollar, which fell 0.1 percent to 0.9670 franc .
Emerging market currencies fell. The Argentinian peso , the world's worst-performing currency this year, was down about 1 percent against the dollar, which last traded at 38.00 pesos. On Thursday, the Argentine peso tumbled 10 percent, bringing month-to-date losses to 27 percent.

Argentina's central bank voted unanimously at an emergency meeting on Thursday to raise its benchmark rate to 60 percent from 45 percent.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The Turkish lira strengthened against the dollar on Friday as a cut in taxes on lira bank deposits helped rein in losses from a day earlier, when sources said the central bank's deputy governor Erkan Kilimci was leaving.
Three sources told Reuters that Kilimci, also a rate-setter, was departing, two weeks before the bank's monetary policy committee meets to address a slump in the lira, which has weakened 42 percent this year.
The currency  firmed 1 percent to 6.5800 by 0730 GMT, rebounding strongly from an overnight low of 6.8994. Turkish markets were closed for a public holiday on Thursday, but the lira continued to trade offshore.
The currency found support from a decision announced in the Official Gazette to lower the level of withholding tax on lira bank deposits, while raising the level on foreign currency deposits of up to one year.
""It appears to be a step taken to make lira deposit usage more attractive and to make a move from forex to lira deposits 'profitable',"" said TEB Investment/BNP Paris strategist Isik Okte.
""More actions will be taken by the authorities to reduce short-term USDTRY (dollar/lira) volatilities.""
The central bank and the banking watchdog have taken a series of measures to try to prop up the currency since its recent slide began, although it has not raised interest rates since early June. 
The central bank was not available for comment on Thursday on Kilimci's departure. Kilimci is joining the board of the Development Bank of Turkey, according to a document from that bank. President Tayyip Erdogan will appoint his replacement.
""Kilimci had no disagreements with the central bank administration on any issues - including interest rates. His expertise will be employed at another public position, that's all,"" a senior source told Reuters.
The central bank has been under pressure from Erdogan not to increase interest rates, despite high inflation and the lira's slide, which has fueled concerns about Turkey's economic outlook.

However, traders said market sentiment was hurt by renewed pressure from trade tensions between Beijing and Washington, and they were afraid sharp losses in the local unit could again force the authorities to roll out more stabilizing measures.
Bloomberg News reported on Thursday that Trump is prepared to quickly ramp up a trade war with China and has told aides he is ready to impose tariffs on $200 billion more in Chinese imports as soon as the public comment period on the plan ends next week.
""This doesn't make it easier for the market to digest and I'd expect this to dampen sentiment across the APAC region today,"" Kerry Craig, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management said in a note.
The stronger U.S. dollar ""is the biggest near term challenge for Asian markets,"" he said.
Prior to market opening on Friday, the People's Bank of China weakened its official yuan midpoint  less than expected to 6.8246 per dollar, 133 pips, or 0.19 percent, softer than the previous fix of 6.8113. 
Friday's fixing, the weakest since Monday, was also the biggest one-day weakening in percentage terms since Aug. 24. But it was 80 pips firmer than Reuters' estimate of 6.8326 per dollar.
In the spot market, onshore yuan  opened at 6.8420 per dollar and was changing hands at 6.8352 as of 0302 GMT, 88 pips firmer than the previous late session close.
Its offshore counterpart , which is more freely traded without restrictions, recovered to pare some of its losses overnight on Friday morning. It traded at 6.8516 as of 0302 GMT compared with previous close of 6.8688. 
Some traders said the Friday's fixing was much stronger than their models had suggested, even after they took a ""counter-cyclical"" factor into consideration. They interpreted it as a sign that authorities were unwilling to see further weakness in the yuan after a record 10 straight weeks of losses.
On Aug. 24, China's central bank said it was adjusting its methodology for fixing the daily midpoint to keep the currency market stable.
Market participants largely took the X-factor as a tool to reduce price swings and counteract depreciation pressure on the yuan.
The Chinese currency has weakened more than 8 percent to the dollar since the end of March and booked a year-to-date loss of nearly 5 percent.
Trump told Bloomberg in an interview on Thursday that the United States was studying currency manipulation ""formula"" for the yuan.
""It is a formula,"" Trump said. ""And we are looking very strongly at the formula.""
In the past, Trump has repeatedly accused China of manipulating the yuan, but the U.S. Treasury has not declared China a currency manipulator since 1994.
Earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin praised China for supporting its currency and said ""that is not currency manipulation"".

In global markets, the dollar firmed against its major trading partners, finding support as the latest round of U.S.-China trade tensions dulled investor risk appetite, with weakness in emerging market currencies also helping lift the greenback.

Citing six people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that Trump wanted to move ahead with a plan to impose the tariffs as soon as a public-comment period concludes next week. The report came after the U.S. and China imposed tariffs on $16 billion worth of goods on each other. The two countries also slapped each other with a $34 billion worth of imports in July.
The U.S. Dollar Index, widely seen as a safe-haven asset in recent months, gained 0.04% to 94.68 by 11:30AM ET (03:30 GMT).
""There is an ongoing trend to buy the dollar on the trade friction theme, which has negatively affected emerging market currencies and in turn fuels the dollar's rise,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
Meanwhile, Trump said his administration is examining “formulas” to determine if countries are manipulating their currencies.
“It is a formula,” Trump said Thursday. “And we are looking very strongly at the formula.”
The U.S. President has repeatedly accused China of manipulating its currency, although he was not able to present evidence to support his claim. His accusation also appeared to conflict with findings of the Treasury Department, which refused to name any country as currency manipulator earlier in the year in its semi-annual report on forex policy.

458,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 10:30PM ET</span>",Rupiah Falls to Asian Crisis Low as Emerging Market Pain Spreads,"(Bloomberg) -- Indonesia’s rupiah slid to a two-decade low as the market meltdown in Argentina and Turkey raises scrutiny on other emerging markets with current account deficits.
The rupiah fell to 14,750 per dollar, the weakest level since the 1998 Asian financial crisis. The nation’s benchmark bond yields advanced 5 basis points to 8.06 percent.
“The rupiah’s underperformance relative to the rest of emerging markets stems from Indonesia’s weak external payments position, especially the current account deficit,” said Prakash Sakpal, Singapore-based economist at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV. Still, “things now are far different than 20 years ago when the crisis originated in Asia and rupiah’s external creditworthiness was much weaker.”
As investors dumped Turkish and Argentinian assets, countries with large current-account deficits such as Indonesia and India have also seen their currencies and bonds come under selling pressure. The rout in the Argentinian peso and Turkish lira end the recent stability bought by Bank Indonesia’s four rate hikes since mid-May, which has led to a return of foreign funds.
Investors including Western Asset Management Co. said recently there were buying opportunities in Indonesian bonds, given the sound domestic fundamentals and a proactive central bank. With foreigners owning almost 40 percent of the nation’s bonds, Indonesia is particularly vulnerable to jitters in global markets.
The rupiah is down 7.8 percent this year, and first came under pressure from a resurgent greenback and climbing U.S. Treasury yields.
Despite the rupiah’s selloff, investors can take heart in “some underlying improvement in the Indonesian economy” since the 1998 Asian crisis, said Michael Every, head of financial markets research for Rabobank Group in Hong Kong. “I don’t think there’s as much downside risk to the rupiah until we see China devalues its currency significantly,” he said.
Still, the slide in the rupiah has added to Indonesia’s current-account deficit. The shortfall increased to $8 billion in the second quarter, or 3 percent of gross domestic product, from $5.7 billion in the previous three months, according to the latest central bank data.

459,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 07:38PM ET</span>",Argentina to announce new economic measures after peso freefall,"By Hugh Bronstein and Jorge Otaola
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's peso lost as much as nearly one-fifth of its value on Thursday despite the central bank's hiking its benchmark interest rate to a dizzying 60 percent as investors panicked over President Mauricio Macri's handling of an economic crisis. 
After the market close, Treasury Minister Nicolas Dujovne pledged to announce a set of new economic measures on Monday, and will target a fiscal deficit for 2019 that is lower than the current target of 1.3 percent of gross domestic product in order to reduce the government's need to go to debt markets.
Onerous borrowing costs combined with government spending cuts and a drought that crippled Argentina's agricultural sector this year have slammed Latin America's third-largest economy. It is expected to enter recession in the third quarter.
The political fortunes of Macri, who until recently had been expected to easily win re-election late next year, may also be waning.
He is likely to face mounting opposition from emboldened unions after promising further austerity measures following an International Monetary Fund warning on the government's need to cut its fiscal deficit, with voters mindful of the 2002-2003 economic crisis and the burdensome cuts brought by past IMF deals.
""Rapid adjustment will be painful, recession could be deep, and political risk will spike amid dwindling confidence at home,"" Fiona Mackie, regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said on Twitter. 
In an effort to stem a slide in the peso , the world's worst-performing currency this year, and to curb inflation running at 31 percent, the central bank's monetary policy committee at an emergency meeting on Thursday voted unanimously to raise its benchmark rate to 60 percent from 45 percent.
The surprise move, however, failed to stabilize the peso. It finished down 13.12 percent at a record closing low of 39.25 pesos per U.S. dollar, after touching 42 pesos earlier in the day. 
The market turmoil erupted early on Wednesday after Macri said he had reached a deal with the International Monetary Fund to accelerate disbursement of a $50 billion loan program agreed in June, in a misguided attempt to calm investor nerves.
Instead, Macri's admission that there was a ""lack of confidence in the markets"" about Argentina's ability to finance its deficit next year sowed panic among investors. The country has $24.9 billion in peso- and foreign currency-denominated debt payments next year.
The IMF said hours later that it was considering speeding up payments because of the financial meltdown, but that Argentina needed to adopt stronger fiscal and monetary policies. Dujovne said he would travel to Washington on Monday evening to discuss the policies with the IMF's technical staff.
The central bank auctioned $330 million on Thursday, bringing this week's interventions to more than $1 billion. In efforts to prop up the currency the bank has sold more than $13.5 billion this year, leaving it with $54.3 billion in foreign currency reserves.
""WE ARE STRUGGLING""
""We are convinced that these exchange rate levels exaggerate the fundamentals of the Argentine economy,"" Dujovne said, adding that the country would still be ""competitive"" with a stronger peso.
The MerVal stock market (MERV) closed up 5.2 percent, led by export-focused companies that benefit from a weaker currency. 
Despite the deal with the IMF, which had calmed financial markets briefly after it was announced in June, Macri has struggled to convince investors he can restore economic growth while cutting Argentina's budget deficit, reducing inflation and making the $640 billion economy more competitive.
Elected in 2015 on a pledge to end Argentina's repeated cycles of crises, Macri said his orthodox policies would set the stage for sustainable growth. But the private investment he counted on never materialized while cuts to public utility subsidies jacked up water and gas bills, fueling inflation.
Although Argentina's center-left opposition has been weakened by a series of corruption scandals, a rise in poverty levels due to soaring inflation and anger at job cuts under his economic reform is galvanizing the opposition.
""I do not have enough to make ends meet, so imagine people who make less than me,"" said bank worker Julio Varela. ""We are struggling and I voted for Macri!""
The country's biggest labor group, the CGT, and other unions have called for general strikes in late September to protest Macri's belt-tightening measures.

Argentina has already agreed with the IMF to cut its fiscal deficit from 3.7 percent of gross domestic product last year to 2.7 percent in 2018 and 1.3 percent in 2019.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.29% to 94.73.
The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure -- the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy -- rose 2% in the 12 months through July.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.4% last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday.
Some analysts, however, said it was still too early for the Federal Reserve to declare victory on the inflation front as core inflation, which excludes more volatile food and energy prices, reached 2% for just the third time this year in July, and annual comparisons are expected to get tougher.
""The year-over-year comparisons will soon get harder. Last year, price pressures were soft through the summer before gaining steam in September, in part from hurricane-recovery-related spending,"" Economists at Morgan Stanley said.
In the Federal Reserve's most recent meeting in July, policymakers said they expected inflation to come under pressure from falling oil prices, but remained adamant that inflation would continue to trend near the central bank's 2% objective.
Still, expectations for a Fed rate hike in September appear to be fully baked in, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor tool.

USD/TRY hit an intra-day high of 6.8396, a new high for the week as it re-approached the record high of 7.2393 set on August 13.
The sell-off was fueled by a Reuters report that the deputy governor of Turkey’s central bank, Erkan Kilimci, is preparing to resign from his post.

The dollar gained as much as 5.8 percent to 6.8427 against the lira, which was the worst performer among emerging markets, in thin trade during a public holiday in Turkey. The drop accelerated after central bank Deputy Governor Erkan Kilimci was said to be set to resign to join Development Bank of Turkey, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The currency is headed for a fourth day of losses despite a series of steps by the central bank in recent weeks to try to stem a more than 40-percent slide in the currency this year. Policy makers reintroduced borrowing limits for overnight transactions at the interbank money market on Wednesday, effectively tightening liquidity, though investors are looking for rate hikes to restore market confidence.
“The lira is trading weaker on news of the deputy governor,” said Neil Jones, Mizuho Bank’s head of hedge fund sales. “The lira was trading weaker anyway, it looks as though the resignation is adding to the momentum.”
Investors are concerned about double-digit inflation and a deepening current-account deficit, as well U.S. sanctions announced earlier in August over the detention of an American pastor. The central bank has come under pressure from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to avoid rate increases. The resignation news signals the country is still “fully in crisis”, said ABN Amro Bank NV currency strategist Georgette Boele.
“The market still expects the central bank to raise interest rates significantly on September 13, instead of backdoor tightening,” said Piotr Matys, an emerging-market currency strategist at Rabobank. “This would have to be accompanied by fiscal tightening and economic reforms, and perhaps more importantly Ankara should make an effort to defuse diplomatic tension with Washington.”

The United States and Canada expressed optimism on Wednesday that they could reach a new NAFTA deal by a Friday, though Ottawa said a number of tricky issues remained.

Market sentiment continued to be supported by hopes that Canada will join the new trade agreement between the U.S. and Mexico aimed at overhauling the North American Free Trade Agreement ahead of a Friday deadline.
But the new trade deal did little to indicate how a trade spat between the U.S. and China will play out after talks last week ended with little progress and both countries slapped fresh reciprocal tariffs on imports.
Sterling was steady after rising above the 1.30 level against the dollar for the first time in three weeks on Wednesday after European Union negotiator Michel Barnier said the bloc was prepared to offer Britain a partnership after Brexit.
GBP/USD was at 1.3028 after gaining 1.23% in the previous session, its largest one-day percentage gain since March 21.
The pound was also stronger against the euro, with EUR/GBP edging down to 0.8982 after ending the previous session with a loss of 1.09%.
The euro was little changed against the dollar, with EUR/USD at 1.1704 after edging up 0.12% in the previous session.
The dollar was a touch lower against the yen, with USD/JPY dipping 0.07% to 111.63 after rising 0.45% on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, the Turkish lira continued to slide lower against the dollar, falling to its lowest level in more than two weeks.
Deteriorating relations between the U.S. and Ankara and worries about Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's increasing control over monetary policy and the economy have seen the lira tumble almost 40% this year and hit record lows mid-month.
Elsewhere in emerging markets, Argentina's peso slumped to record lows against the dollar as the country sought the early release of standby funds from the International Monetary Fund.
Emerging market currencies have been hard hit by concerns that higher U.S. interest rates will pressure countries that have borrowed heavily in dollars in recent years."

The U.S. Dollar Index, tracking the greenback against a basket of six currencies, dropped 0.03% to 94.57 by 1:45AM ET (05:45 GMT). The index picked up slightly from a four-week low of 94.434 on Tuesday.
The greenback, widely considered as a safe-haven asset in recent months, has been on the defensive this week in the wake of improving risk sentiment in broader markets, as Canada rejoined the NAFTA negotiations on Thursday after U.S. and Mexico announced a bilateral trade deal earlier this week.
Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said the talks with the U.S. were at a “very intense moment” and that she is looking for compromises that were “win-win” for both sides, while U.S. President Donald Trump said he believed Canada “very much want to make the deal.”
The pound's rally after the European Union revived hopes of a Brexit deal was also cited as headwind for the dollar.
Meanwhile, the U.S. reported on Wednesday the strongest second-quarter growth in nearly four years, with the economy expanding at an annual rate of 4.2%..
Markets now widely expect the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates in September and December following last week’s Jackson Hole symposium, where Fed’s chairman Jerome Powell defended policy of interest rate hikes, adding that he expected a low but gradual growth of interest rates as inflation is reaching the country’s 2% objective.
The USD/CNY pair gained 0.2% to 6.8386 while the USD/CNH pair rose 0.3%. Trading volume data on the FX trading platform of CBOE Global Markets showed average daily volume in dollar-offshore yuan jumped to a record $1.7 billion in July, from $421 million a year earlier. On the other hand, EBS Market, NEX Group Plc’s FX trading system, also saw a new high in offshore yuan transactions last month, exceeding the previous peak by 17%.

468,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 03:00PM ET</span>",Argentina Peso Tumbles on Bid to Tap $50 Billion IMF Line Faster,"(Bloomberg) -- Argentina’s peso tumbled to a record low after President Mauricio Macri asked the International Monetary Fund to speed up disbursements from its $50 billion credit line to ease the nation’s financial crisis.
The request reflects the pressure policy makers are under to reassure investors that the government will have enough money to fund itself through next year without incurring more debt. Borrowing costs soared in recent months as the country heads for its second recession in three years with inflation above 30 percent and the world’s highest interest rates.
Macri is in a jam almost three years after taking over from a socialist government with a pledge to normalize the economy and restore growth, facing down massive fiscal and current-account deficits that have spooked investors. While officials had wagered that obtaining the IMF credit line in June would calm nerves and buy the government some time, the selloff in Argentina’s currency has continued -- it’s now down 45 percent this year -- putting pressure on inflation and threatening to throttle growth.
Critics said Macri’s announcement showed he was more focused on securing funding than plans to cut government spending, which some believe should be Macri’s top priority.
“The announcement was very weak,” said Guillermo Nielsen, a former finance secretary from 2002 to 2005. “There is an absolute lack of confidence in the peso.”
IMF officials didn’t respond to requests for comment on Macri’s statement, nor did they issue their own communique.
Hopes for Argentina’s Economic Renaissance Fade Under Macri
Argentina received the first $15 billion disbursement from the IMF in June and the government was expecting to get an additional $3 billion in September. Macri didn’t say how much he had requested from the fund. IMF economists and technicians are in Argentina this week in meetings with government members to review portions of the agreement.
“We have agreed that the IMF will forward all the funds necessary to guarantee compliance with next year’s financial program,” Macri said in a televised address. “This decision aims to eliminate any uncertainty that was created before the worsening of the international outlook.”
Investors may be concerned the move reeks of desperation. After Macri’s announcement, the peso plunged 7.3 percent Wednesday to an unprecedented 33.8 per dollar. It has lost value for eight straight trading sessions. The peso’s 45 percent plummet this year (and 19 percent loss just this month) is the worst performance in emerging markets, which have broadly suffered in recent months as investors sought out safer assets amid the crisis in Turkey.
Argentine dollar bonds also fell, with the 10-year note down 1.6 cent to 74.5 cents on the dollar, pushing its yield up 33 basis points to a near-record 10.15 percent.
Confidence in the government fell in August, matching the lowest level since Macri took office, according to data released Wednesday by the University of Torcuato Di Tellato. The level slipped to 1.94 on a 0-5 scale, down from 3.14 during Macri’s first full month in office in 2016.
Still, there was some optimism among analysts. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos called the request for more IMF funds a “positive development.” BTG Pactual Argentina’s chief economist, Alejo Costa, said getting the funds faster would be a major accomplishment for Macri, considering the IMF isn’t known to make these types of changes.
The currency crisis has put Argentina on track for a recession this year. Treasury Minister Nicolas Dujovne said Monday the economy will contract 1 percent in 2018, in a sharp reversal from a 3 percent growth forecast earlier the year.
As part of the IMF deal, Macri agreed to speed up spending cuts to reach a fiscal balance by 2020. The fiscal target this year is 2.7 percent of gross domestic product, and it’s 1.3 percent for 2019. Some analysts have noted for months that it will be difficult for Macri to both cut spending more in 2019 and win next year’s presidential election.

469,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>","As Trump Slams China on Yuan, Currency Market Trades Record Amounts","(Bloomberg) -- Turnover in the offshore yuan has reached unprecedented levels, spurred by U.S. President Donald Trump’s broadsides against Chinese currency practices and the protracted trade dispute between the world’s two biggest economies.
On the FX trading platform of Cboe Global Markets, average daily volume in dollar-offshore yuan jumped to a record $1.7 billion in July, from $421 million a year earlier. EBS Market, NEX Group Plc’s FX trading system, also saw a new high in offshore yuan transactions last month, exceeding the previous peak by 17 percent. The volumes, which represent a portion of the offshore yuan market, surged as the yuan slid for a fourth straight month. The drop raised speculation that China was deliberately weakening the currency amid its intensifying tariff impasse with America.
Last week’s announcement by the People’s Bank of China’s that banks would resume use of the counter-cyclical factor in setting the yuan’s daily reference rate may further fuel activity, in the view of Brad Bechtel at Jefferies. The fixing adjustment works to restrain market influences, meaning it will have to compete with forces such as tense trade negotiations and slowing Chinese growth. That tug-of-war should increase volatility, said Bechtel.
“If anything, it creates a more tradeable market,” said Bechtel, the firm’s global head of foreign exchange. The PBOC is “pushing back against what the market’s doing, but at the same time, there are still a lot of variables.”
The offshore yuan, or CNH, has slumped about 6 percent since mid-June as the two nations exchanged tit-for-tat tariff threats, adding to swings in emerging-market currencies. The pace of the decline prompted the PBOC to ask Chinese lenders to discourage “herd behavior” and momentum-chasing in the currency.
Momentum Play
The offshore yuan’s decline was likely driven by the same momentum-chasers that the PBOC was trying to curtail, according to Mingze Wu, a currency trader at INTL FCStone in Singapore.
The offshore yuan “has better accessibility for speculators,” Wu said via email. “As such, I would not be surprised if the increase in volume has been mostly speculative driven.”
Activity in the onshore yuan -- which is only accessible to China-based investors -- has been picking up as well. Data from China Foreign Exchange Trade System, an interbank trading platform affiliated with the PBOC, show that onshore yuan turnover in late July reached the highest level since January 2017.
“The trading volume will likely hold steady at the current levels as sentiment towards the currency has stabilized, thanks to the re-introduction of the counter-cyclical factor,” said Ken Cheung, Hong Kong-based senior Asian currency strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. “Investors no longer feel the rush to cut their positions.”
The turbulence has made this summer the busiest in years for Cheung, with clients and media inquiring about the yuan’s decline and its implications.
Bechtel can relate.
“Activity levels definitely increased across the client base,” he said. “There are those who are always involved or looking at it, but when it starts to move like this, a lot of folks jump on board.”"

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.11% to 94.53.
Gross domestic product increased at a 4.2% annual rate in the April-June period, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, in its penultimate estimate, beating economists' forecast of 4.0% and ahead of the preliminary reading of 4.1% seen last month.
The strong GDP data was driven by contributions from non-residential fixed investment, exports and federal and state government spending, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
But analysts questioned sustainability of above-trend U.S. growth.
""Temporary support from one-off gains coupled with trends of waning momentum, not to mention outright weakness in the housing market, calls into question the sustainability of above-trend topline growth looking out to the second half of the year,"" Stifel said.
The dollar's advance was stifled by a surging pound after EU negotiator Michel Barnier said he was willing to offer the U.K. a trade deal that has never been offered to a third country, easing fears of the U.K. leaving the European Union without a deal.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose against most currencies on Wednesday especially those in emerging markets, as optimism over a U.S.-Mexico trade deal gave way to concern that a conflict over trade between Washington and Beijing was not about to end soon.
The deadline for public comment on U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods is on Sept. 5, with the new measures possibly taking effect that month..
""There is still a long way to go with Trump recently again threatening tariffs on cars from Europe and the U.S. preparing another $200 billion of tariffs against China,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst, at OANDA in London.
The U.S currency had dipped to a four-week low overnight as investors unwound safe-haven bets on the currency after the United States and Mexico agreed on Monday on overhauls to NAFTA. 
The dollar has fallen for three consecutive weeks, even though the United States was raising interest rates faster than other major economies.
But on Wednesday the dollar rose 0.2 percent against the yen to 111. 48 yen . It was higher against the Australian and New Zealand dollars, up 0.6 percent  and 0.2 percent  respectively.
The dollar was also up against the Mexican peso  and soared against the South African rand  and Turkish lira .
The greenback was also supported overall by data showing U.S. economic growth was a bit stronger than initially thought in the second quarter, notching its best performance in nearly four years.
Gross domestic product grew at a 4.2 percent annualized rate, the Commerce Department data showed in its second estimate of GDP growth for the second quarter. That was slightly up from the 4.1 percent pace of expansion reported in July and was the fastest rate since the third quarter of 2014.
The data has cemented expectations for an interest rate rise next month. Fed funds futures have priced in a 96 percent probability of a 25 basis-point rate increase at its next policy announcement on Sept. 26.
The euro (EUR=), meanwhile, was flat at $1.1693 after gaining in the last three sessions, as worries mounted that Italy's public deficit could exceed the European Union's ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product.
The Canadian dollar  was slightly lower on the day versus the U.S. dollar, after rising in the last three days.

473,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 08:21AM ET</span>",Rouble dips as emerging market jitters outweigh Putin's pension move,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The rouble eased on Wednesday alongside other emerging market currencies after ratings agency Moody's sounded more alarm about the Turkish banking sector, outweighing the positive impact of Russian president Vladimir Putin's pension reform.
Putin said he has decided to dilute unpopular draft legislation to reform the pension system which has hurt his popularity, but said serious demographic challenges meant some kind of reform was necessary.
By 1215 GMT, the rouble was down 0.3 percent to 68.07 against the dollar , having risen to 67.7 during Putin's speech. Last week it hit 69.01, its lowest since April 2016.
""Investors estimated the softening of the pension reform as a reduction of domestic political risks,"" said Kirill Tremasov, the former head of the economy ministry's macroeconomic forecasting department and now head of research at Loko-Invest.
Against the euro, the rouble fell lost 0.06 percent to 79.40 , remaining under pressure even though the central bank halted its daily purchasing of foreign currency last week.
Analysts at Rosbank, a subsidiary of  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), said in a note that market players were buying dollars whenever there was no specific and important news to dictate otherwise. 
Geopolitical concerns were a persistent pressure and the rouble was suffering from mounting global risk aversion, analysts said.
U.S. sanctions against Russia, tied to a nerve agent attack in Britain, came into effect on Monday and a second batch of penalties could be imposed after 90 days.
The rouble has also now lost support from month-end tax payments, and the foreign currency sales by exporters is seen running out of steam, VTB Capital analysts said.
Exporters usually convert their foreign currency revenues in order to meet local tax duties that fall in the second half of every month.
However, the rouble did glean some support from higher oil prices, and Russian stock indexes rose. 
Brent crude oil (LCOc1), a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was up 0.59 percent at $76.40 a barrel.
The dollar-denominated RTS index (IRTS) was up 0.26 percent to 1,081.05 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index (IMOEX) was 0.87 percent higher at 2,336.45 points, after hitting its highest level since July 16 at 2,239.72.
""Probably, the general undervaluation of our market on the back of a record high oil price in roubles supports a stable demand for Russian shares from many investors,"" BCS brokerage analysts wrote in a note.

474,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 05:01AM ET</span>",Turkish Lira Drops as Central Bank Move Fails to Lift Confidence,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey’s lira extended its slump to a third day as a central bank move on overnight borrowing limits failed to bolster investor sentiment.
The dollar surged as much as 2 percent against the lira, which led declines among emerging-market currencies. The central bank said on Wednesday it is altering banks’ borrowing limits for overnight transactions, which effectively tightens liquidity by ending unrestricted funding it has offered since Aug. 13.
The central bank has announced a series of measures in recent weeks to try to contain a slide of more than 40 percent in the lira this year. Yet investors do not see policy makers’ approach to market pressure as a sustainable way to tackle double-digit inflation and a widening current-account deficit.
“It’s yet more smoke and mirrors from the central bank,” said Nigel Rendell, an analyst at Medley Global Advisors LLC in London. “The change in banks’ overnight borrowing limits is aimed at trying to ease pressures on the banking system, rather than tackling Turkey’s underlying problem, which remains persistently high inflation.”
The lira was trading 1.6 percent lower at 6.3746 per dollar as of 11:36 a.m. in Istanbul. Together with the Argentine peso, it’s the worst-performing emerging-market currency this year. The yield on 10-year bonds climbed 19 basis points to 21.95 percent, after touching a record high earlier this month.
Data on Wednesday showed an index of Turkish economic confidence fell to the lowest level since 2009 in August, while the country’s trade deficit widened in July from the previous month.
The central bank, which next meets to decide policy on Sept. 13, has got “zero bang for its buck” in Wednesday’s move, given the renewed lira selling, Rendell said.
“The downward currency trend will continue until monetary policy is significantly tighter,” he said. “If the bank really wants to stop the rout and is serious about tackling ever-higher inflation, it needs to raise interest rates by at least 500 basis points.”

The lira has lost about 40 percent of its value this year, hit by both concern about President Tayyip Erdogan's influence over monetary policy and a worsening rift with the United States over an American pastor Turkey has detained.
Investors are particularly concerned that Erdogan and Albayrak, his son-in-law, are not doing enough to guarantee central bank independence, assuage the markets and stem the sell-off.
""We do not see a big risk about Turkey's economy or financial system,"" Albayrak was quoted as saying by the newspaper Hurriyet, when asked about the biggest risk for 2019.
The Turkish lira  weakened as far as 6.4 to the dollar in early trade on Wednesday, its weakest since Aug. 15. By 0728 GMT, it was at 6.3700.
Ratings agency Moody's on Tuesday sounded more alarm about the banking sector, downgrading 20 financial institutions and citing the increased risk of a deterioration in funding.
""The downgrades primarily reflect a substantial increase in the risk of a downside scenario, where a further negative shift in investor sentiment could lead to a curtailing of wholesale funding,"" it said.
Turkish government dollar-denominated bonds fell after the downgrade. Its 2043 Eurobond lost 1 cent to 68.22 cents in the dollar according to Tradeweb, and a 2045 bond dropped fell 1.1 cent to 80.77 cents.
For years, Turkish companies have borrowed in euros and dollars, to take advantage of lower rates. That has exposed them to substantial currency risk, heightening concern about how banks may be hurt by the crisis.

Separately, data showed on Wednesday that a measure of Turkey's economic confidence fell to its lowest since March 2009.

But the new trade deal did little to indicate how a trade spat between the U.S. and China may develop after talks last week ended with little progress and both countries slapped fresh reciprocal tariffs on imports.

The yuan showed some stability early in the week and paused its steep downtrend after the central bank moved to put a floor under the currency as the trade war with the United States grinds on.
Late on Friday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) announced that earlier in August it started changing the way it calculated the yuan's mid-point, resuming use of a ""counter-cyclical"" variable.

The guidance rate was 25 pips firmer than Reuters' estimate of 6.8097 per dollar.
In the spot market, the onshore yuan  opened at 6.8090 per dollar and was changing hands at 6.8138 at midday, 108 pips weaker than the previous late session close and 0.10 percent softer than the midpoint.
Traders said the morning moves followed corporate clients' dollar buying, which dragged spot yuan lower.
They also said some major state-owned Chinese banks were spotted selling small amounts of dollars. But the traders were unsure whether the selling represented big banks' proprietary trading, or was done on behalf of the central bank to prevent the yuan from falling too fast.
""Despite USD/CNY's return to 6.80, its volatility is converging with and exceeding G7 FX volatility for the first time in history,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said in a note to clients on Wednesday.

478,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 01:15AM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar Slips as Concerns Over China-U.S. Trade War Linger ,"Investing.com - The dollar slid to a four-week low on Wednesday as markets remain concerned over the intensifying China-U.S. trade war.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, slipped 0.02% to 94.61 by 1:10AM ET (05:10 GMT). The index dipped to 94.434 overnight in the U.S. session, its lowest since July 31.
Minori Uchida, chief currency strategist at MUFG Bank in Tokyo, said investors were closely watching developments in the Sino-U.S. trade dispute as the dealine for public comment on U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods is due early September.
Low-level trade talks between China and the U.S. ended last week with little progress made, while Trump is reportedly meeting his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping later this year to further discuss trade issues.
The USD/CNY pair rose 0.2% to 6.8153 on Wednesday as U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin praised China for supporting the yuan just a week after President Donald Trump accused China of manipulating its currency.
""Their currency is more of a controlled currency than other markets that are free access,"" Mnuchin said in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday. ""But if they go in and support their currency, that is not currency manipulation.""
""If they [China] let their currency weaken, either for structural reasons or for actual manipulation, that is something that is manipulation,"" he added.
His comments came a week after Trump said China is manipulating yuan to make up for having to pay tariffs on imports imposed by the U.S.
Meanwhile, the USD/JPY pair traded 0.03% lower to 111.17.
The AUD/USD pair was little changed at 0.7336 after losing about 0.1% on Tuesday, and the NZD/USD was unchanged at 0.6708."
479,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 10:01PM ET</span>",Trump's Dollar Policy Could Derail Citigroup's Bullish Forecast,"(Bloomberg) --  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). is bullish on the dollar. U.S. President Donald Trump could change that.
The administration’s preference for a weaker greenback, combined with its unpredictable policy moves, pose a key risk for foreign exchange markets, according to Calvin Tse, North American head of G-10 FX strategy at Citigroup in New York. Even though the chances are slim, investors can’t ignore the possibility that the Treasury may intervene by selling dollars, Tse said.
“We remain structurally bullish,” as strong growth and relative yields attract capital to the U.S., Tse said in an email. “The biggest risk to our view, however, is that the Treasury decides to intervene to weaken the USD. Though still a tail risk, if they were able to corral the Fed to participate, this would be a game changer for the USD outlook.”
The dollar has risen more than 1.3 percent this year amid strong U.S. economic growth and Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes. The greenback’s been whipsawed by escalating tension between the U.S. and its trading partners, punctuated by Trump’s repeated accusations that China and the European Union are manipulating their currencies.
While some traders and analysts consider the chances of U.S. intervention remote, the possibility appears less far-fetched than it once was because of the Trump administration’s pronouncements and unorthodox policy. The U.S. hasn’t intervened in markets to sell the greenback since 2000, when it united with fellow members of the Group of Seven in an effort to boost the sliding euro.
In terms of firepower, Tse calculates the Treasury and Fed would have a combined $189 billion to step into the market. He says such an move could trigger double-digit percentage losses for the greenback in a matter of months, eroding the currency’s position as a global reserve asset.
“The U.S. has enjoyed the ability to run twin deficits without much detriment to its currency -- because it holds the sacred position of being the reserve currency of the world,” Tse wrote separately in a client note. “But if this status is lost, it opens the floodgates for asset repatriation.”

480,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 05:30PM ET</span>",The Dollar Is Losing Its Mojo at the Wrong Time,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- What’s wrong with the dollar? Barely two weeks ago the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index reached its highest since June 2017. President Donald Trump tied the strength to confidence in the U.S., boasting in a tweet on Aug. 16 that “money is pouring into our cherished DOLLAR like rarely before.” But since then the greenback dropped as much as 2.2 percent, reaching its lowest of the month on Tuesday before recovering to end the day slightly higher. 
At a time when the U.S. is embarking on a borrowing binge to pay for trillion-dollar federal budget deficits, any weakness in the currency should concern the government. After all, foreigners might have second thoughts about lending money to the U.S. if they expect the dollar to depreciate. That could cause borrowing costs to rise regardless of whether the Federal Reserve raises interest rates or not. NatWest Markets strategist James McCormick (NYSE:MKC) has identified six primary reasons for the dollar’s recent downturn, ranging from Trump’s recent criticisms of the Fed’s tighter monetary policy to moves by China to keep its currency from getting any weaker. But perhaps the most intriguing reason is the notion that U.S. economic growth has peaked and will only slow. Although McCormick noted in his report dated Aug. 25 that the U.S. economy is in good shape, a growing number of strategists are starting to point to data showing reports coming in softer than forecast.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).’s economic surprise indexes show that not only has U.S. data largely missed estimates this month, they are missing by the greatest degree since September 2018. As such, the currency strategists at  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). both say they see limited upside for the dollar for now.
BOND SENTIMENT SOURSBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yields closed last week at 2.81 percent, their lowest since May, amid a heated debate over whether a speech by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell — in which he said “there does not seem to be an elevated risk of overheating” — leaned dovish. But the bond market reversed swiftly this week, with yields rising to 2.88 percent in late trading Tuesday. Does that mean bond traders are having second thoughts about whether Powell may be leaning toward ending interest-rate hikes sooner rather than later? Maybe, but perhaps the better explanation is that the bears are taking advantage of the rally to set up short positions at what they think are more attractive levels. A widely followed JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). survey released Tuesday showed that bond traders are the most bearish since March. Its so-called All Client Net Long index slid to negative 21 from negative 17 in the week ended Aug 21. The economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. emboldened the bears by reiterating their call that that the Fed will boost rates two more times this year and four times in 2019. In a report Monday, the Goldman economists emphasized Powell’s nod to a recent Fed study that indicated it would be ill-advised for the central bank to ignore low unemployment and slow the pace of rate hikes, Bloomberg News’s Liz Capo McCormick reported.
WHAT NOW FOR STOCKS?One day after setting a record, the S&P 500 Index topped that by posting yet another high. The benchmark closed at 2,897.52, putting it less than 2 percent away from the 2,950 median year-end estimate of 25 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg News at midyear. But rather than recommending investors get defensive, get ready for strategists to get even more bullish and start boosting their year-end estimates as soon as they get back from their summer vacations — if they haven’t done so already. DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas nicely summed up the general sentiment toward stocks in a note to clients on Tuesday. “As long as you believe the U.S. economy is in decent shape (we do) and trade/tariff wars will not push the global economy into a recession (we don’t), U.S. stocks are reasonably valued because earnings are strong/rising and interest rates remain low,” Colas wrote, referring in that last point to the 10-year Treasury note yield's seeming inability to rise above 3 percent. At about 18 times estimated earnings, the S&P 500 is cheaper now than it was back in January, when the ratio reached almost 19 times, despite the rally in equities. That’s largely due to strong earnings growth. Colas figures the best-case scenario is for the S&P 500 to advance an additional 8.7 percent by the end of the year.
BRAZIL POLITICS MATTERIt’s getting ugly in Brazil, where global investors are revolting against the nation’s increasingly unstable political environment. Brazil’s real fell on Tuesday to its weakest level since January 2016. It has lost about 9 percent of its value this month, compared with a more modest 1.40 percent decline in the MSCI EM Currency Index. The nation’s equities are also down for the month and the cost to protect against losses in Brazil’s bonds with credit-default swaps has jumped to the highest since the end of 2016. To understand how crazy Brazil’s politics are, consider that support for former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva — currently in jail for a corruption conviction — rose in all three major polls that came out last week, horrifying traders who dread the return of his Workers’ Party to the presidential palace in Brasilia, according to Bloomberg News. If allowed to run, Lula would win a runoff round against all candidates with as much as 53 percent of the ballots, the polls showed. “Brazil remains a paradox,” Sean Newman, a money manager at Invesco Advisers in Atlanta, told Bloomberg News. “In an election where no one seems to care about candidates, all want less corruption but favor the man behind the biggest debacle in the country’s history.”
HOT COMMODITYOne of the more important industrial metals is bucking the broad weakness in commodities, with prices rising to their highest since June. The price of aluminum on the London Metals Exchange jumped 1.84 percent on Tuesday to $2,133.50 per ton, extending its gain since mid-month to 5.36 percent. Barring a serious surprise, aluminum prices will rise in August for the first time since May. Meanwhile, the broader Bloomberg Commodity Index is poised for its third consecutive monthly loss. The rebound is being credited to reports of delays in shipments of alumina — the commodity used to make aluminum — from Australia because of a strike at an  Alcoa  (NYSE:AA) plant and maintenance at producer South32’s Worsley operations, according to Bloomberg News’s Mark Burton. Also, production in China is down amid a general tightness in the market as a result of sanctions against Russia that has curtailed activity at United Co. Rusal. “We view alumina as likely to remain fundamentally tight through the coming months,” Colin Hamilton, a managing director for commodities research at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a research note.
TEA LEAVESThe U.S. Commerce Department on Wednesday will provide its second estimate of just how fast the economy expanded in the second quarter. Although a big change isn’t expected, with economists forecasting growth of 4 percent, compared with the 4.1 percent that was originally reported on July 27, the report shouldn’t be dismissed. That’s because investors and others will get their first look at economy-wide business profits. Earnings before taxes and excluding profits on inventories and capital accumulation — the measure most closely associated with health in the corporate sector — has flat-lined somewhat recently after rebounding strongly from June 2016 to September 2017, according to Bloomberg Economics.

481,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 01:05PM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar Ditched Amid Optimism Over Trade,"Investing.com - The dollar continued its retreat against its rivals Tuesday, shrugging off mostly positive U.S. economic data as the United States' deal with Mexico eased trade concerns, reducing demand for the greenback.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.23% to 94.45.
Optimism over trade relations -- after the U.S. struck a deal with Mexico on Monday -- prompted traders to continue to unwind their bullish bets on dollar, some of which had been made on the back of trade uncertainties.
Still, lingering trade tensions remained as investor focus shifted to U.S.-Canada trade talks, which got underway on Tuesday. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday the Trump administration's objective ""is to try to get Canada on board quickly.""
President Trump on Monday announced his administration had reached a deal with Mexico on issues that have upended the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the current trilateral trade agreement among the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
USD/MSN rose 1.10% to 18.9712, while USD/CAD fell 0.38% to C$1.2918.
Upbeat data showing consumer confidence hit an 18-year high and strong regional manufacturing drew a modest advance from lows in the dollar.
The Conference Board’s consumer confidence gauge rose to 133.4 in August from 127.9 in July, beating economists’ forecast for a reading of 126.7.
The Richmond Fed manufacturing index rose by 4 points to a reading of 24 in August from the prior month, beating expectations for a reading of 18.
Analysts attributed the rise in consumer confidence to a tightening labor market, underpinning expectations for rises in wage growth.
""Current optimism continues to be a reflection of the tightening labor market. Consumers generally expect their incomes to rise over the next six months, while employment conditions are expected to remain fairly stable,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said in a note to clients.
Also keeping a lid on the dollar's advance was a rise in the euro against the greenback to $1.1717, up 0.33%, despite concerns over political uncertainty in Italy.
""The main downside risk to the outlook for EUR/USD in the near-term continues to be posed by Italian political developments,"" MUFG said.
GBP/USD was flat at $1.2889, as fears of a no-Brexit deal, which would see the U.K. crash out of the European Union without a trade deal with the member bloc, continued to limit gains in the pair.

482,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer confidence races to near 18-year high,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence surged to near an 18-year high in August, as households remained upbeat on the labor market, pointing to strong consumer spending that should help to sustain the economy for the remainder of the year.
The bright economic outlook, however, was dimmed somewhat by other data on Tuesday showing the goods trade deficit widened sharply in July as exports of agricultural products tumbled, indicating trade could be a drag on growth in the third quarter.
The jump in confidence this month suggests consumers are little worried about the Trump administration's protectionist trade policy, which has led to an escalation of a trade war between the United States and China as well as tit-for-tat tariffs with the European Union, Canada and Mexico.
Economists have warned that the duties on imports will raise prices for ordinary Americans as well as make raw materials more expensive for some manufacturers. There have been reports of some companies either laying off workers or planning to as a result of the import tariffs. 
""That suggests a degree of skepticism about trade, inflation, or anything else knocking the economy off track,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. ""For now, consumers remain resiliently positive, which bodes well for household spending in the coming months.""
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index jumped 5.5 points to 133.4 this month, the highest reading since October 2000. Consumers' assessment of both current business and labor market conditions improved further in August. 
Many consumers said they planned to buy a house or other big-ticket items in the months ahead. The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful, rose to 30.0 in August from 28.0 in the prior month.
That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. It is consistent with continued reduction in slack in the labor market, which is near full employment. Consumers' near-term inflation expectations moderated this month from July. 
The Conference Board survey's findings are in stark contrast with a University of Michigan survey showing consumer sentiment falling to an 11-month low in early August as households worried about rising inflation eating into their modest wage increases and eroding their purchasing power.
Economists attributed the divergence between the two surveys on their treatment of the labor market.
""The latest reading from the Conference Board index was one of the more upbeat measures, which could be related to the survey's emphasis on the labor market, many other labor market indicators have been strong lately.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading flat a day after the United States and Mexico reached an agreement on an overhaul of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The dollar (DXY) slipped to a four-week low against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell.
GOODS TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS 
Separately, the Commerce Department said in its advance economic indicators report that the goods trade gap surged 6.3 percent to $72.2 billion last month. Exports of goods dropped 1.7 percent to $140.0 billion, weighed down by a 6.7 percent plunge in shipments of food, feeds and beverages. 
That likely reflected a continued reversal of soybean exports after farmers front-loaded shipments of the crop in April and May to China before Beijing's retaliatory tariffs came into effect in early July. 
There were also decreases in exports of capital and consumer goods last month, though motor vehicle exports rose. Imports of goods rose 0.9 percent to $212.2 billion in July, boosted by imports of food, industrial supplies and capital goods.
There were also increases in motor vehicle imports, but imports of consumer goods fell.
The government reported last month that trade contributed 1.06 percentage points to the economy's 4.1 percent annualized growth pace in the second quarter. 
Despite the anticipated drag from trade, economic growth in the July-September quarter is still likely to remain solid.
The Commerce Department also reported on Tuesday that wholesale inventories jumped 0.7 percent in July and stocks at retailers increased 0.4 percent, suggesting inventories could provide a boost to gross domestic product this quarter.
There was an outright inventory liquidation in the second quarter. As a result, inventories subtracted a full percentage point from GDP growth in the April-June quarter.
A third report showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas rose 6.3 percent in June on a year-over-year basis after increasing 6.5 percent in May. House prices are being driven by tight inventories.
The combination of higher house prices and rising mortgage rates is making the purchase of a home unaffordable for some Americans, especially as wage growth lags. That has hurt home sales, leading to a slowdown in the housing market. 

""House prices will advance this year and next, albeit at a relatively modest pace compared with the last several years,"" said Brent Campbell, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

484,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 07:43AM ET</span>","Turkish lira weakens against dollar, minister warns on sanctions","ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The Turkish lira weakened on Tuesday as investors weighed up Turkey's efforts to manage its rift with the United States after Finance Minister Berat Albayrak warned U.S. trade sanctions against Ankara could destabilize the Middle East. 
The row with Washington over an American evangelical Christian pastor detained in Turkey on terrorism charges has accelerated losses in the lira, which is down about 38 percent against the dollar this year.
More broadly, investors are worried about the direction of monetary policy under President Tayyip Erdogan. The president, a self-described ""enemy of interest rates"" has repeatedly put public pressure on the central bank and picked Albayrak, his son-in-law, as finance minister.
The attendant sell-off in the lira has raised concerns about the impact on the broader economy - given Turkey's reliance on dollar-denominated energy imports - and a possible surge in bad loans in the banking sector.
""At this point in time Turkey has become pretty much un-tradable,"" said Tim Ash of BlueBay Asset Management in emailed comments. 
""The market wants to see specific delivery on policy whether that is monetary, fiscal or action to clear up problems in the banking sector.""
At 1021 GMT, the lira  stood at 6.2150 against the dollar, easing from a close of 6.1200 on Monday, when it weakened to near 6.3 before rebounding in its first day of trade after a week-long holiday.
EUROPEAN TIES
After meeting his French counterpart in Paris, Albayrak highlighted Ankara's push for better ties with Europe and took aim at the United States, saying U.S. sanctions could ultimately aggravate the region's terrorism and refugee crises.
U.S. President Donald Trump this month authorized a doubling of duties on aluminum and steel imported from Turkey, triggering retaliatory measures from Ankara.
Investors are also worried by a U.S. Treasury investigation into state-owned Turkish lender Halkbank (IS:HALKB), which could face a potentially hefty fine over allegations of busting sanctions on Iran. The bank has said all its transactions were legal.
Turkey and the United States are also at odds over their diverging interests in Syria and U.S. objections to Ankara's plan to buy Russian defense systems.
Separately, the government announced a new campaign on Tuesday to support the real estate sector, offering a 10 percent discount on some home sales. Under the campaign, any price increases due to rising exchange rates will be discounted from the cost of the residence, the environment and urbanization minister said.

The main stock index (XU100) rose 1.89 percent on Tuesday to 93,008.72 points.

485,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 05:00AM ET</span>",Lira Extends Slide as Investors See Policy Concerns Unaddressed,"(Bloomberg) -- The lira slid for a second day in the absence of signals from policy makers of reforms to address Turkey’s economic woes.
The currency dropped in choppy trading after relative calm during last week’s public holidays. The return of local traders has added to a selloff driven by a worrying economic outlook, according to Cristian Maggio, the head of emerging-markets strategy at TD Securities in London.
The surge in the dollar against the lira on Monday amid increased local market activity shows “lots of the upside pressure on the currency pair is domestic,” said Maggio. “I would argue that foreigners are negative on Turkey but look for tactical opportunities to take a position, be it long or short. Locals, however, seem to have a much stronger and long-term negative bias on their own currency.”
Investors say the concerns that sent the lira to successive record lows earlier this month remain in place, including double-digit inflation, a deepening current-account deficit and the reluctance of policy makers to raise interest rates. U.S. sanctions announced earlier in August over the detention of an American pastor have further hit sentiment and exacerbated worries over Turkey’s vulnerabilities.
The lira was 1.8 percent down at 6.2295 per dollar by 11.15 a.m. in Istanbul, taking losses so far this week to more than 3 percent. Short-term volatility in the currency is by far the highest among emerging markets, having climbed above 40 percent this week.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called the market turmoil an “economic war” waged by “foreign powers.” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire urged Turkey to pursue economic reforms at a joint news conference following a meeting with Turkish counterpart Berat Albayrak in Paris on Monday.
“All the troubles are now coming to the fore because the external environment has become a lot more challenging than it used to be,” Maggio said. “From an economic point of view, Turkey will have to enter a long phase of low growth, with very high chances of stagnation or even recession.”
It’s “too early” to buy the dips in Turkey as turmoil is driven by unresolved economic mismanagement, said Gabriela Santos, global markets strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management, as she voiced optimism for emerging markets following the U.S. trade deal with Mexico.

486,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 04:51AM ET</span>","Ruble lifted by domestic payments, higher oil prices","MOSCOW (Reuters) - The ruble firmed slightly on Tuesday supported by domestic month-end tax payments, suspension of daily dollar purchases by the central bank and higher oil prices.
At 0811 GMT, the ruble was 0.1 percent stronger against the dollar at 67.46 <RUBUTSTN=MCX> and had gained 0.04 percent to trade at 78.84 versus the euro <EURRUBTN=MCX>.
Oil prices hit their highest since July 11 in early trade. Brent crude oil (LCOc1), a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was last up 0.47 percent at $76.57 a barrel.
The ruble found support from local month-end tax payments that end on Tuesday. To meet these duties, export-focused companies convert their dollar revenues, buying rubles.
The central bank's decision to halt daily purchases of foreign currency from Thursday last week also helped the Russian currency stabilize after sharp losses earlier in August.
The U.S. dollar touched its lowest against a basket of currencies (DXY) since early August as a U.S.-Mexico trade deal aimed at overhauling the North American Free Trade Agreement boosted appetite for riskier assets.
Analysts at Rosbank said they don't overestimate the positive contribution of these factors for the ruble and don't expect the Russian currency to fully recover in the coming weeks.
The ruble has lost almost 8 percent of its value since the beginning of the month, hit by fears of U.S. sanctions and jitters in emerging markets.
""Geopolitical tensions and sanctions risks continue to dominate,"" analysts at Rosbank said.
U.S. sanctions against Russia tied to a nerve agent attack in Britain, which were announced earlier this month, came into effect on Monday and a second batch of penalties may be imposed after 90 days.
U.S. senators also prepared a draft bill that includes restrictions on investment in new Russian sovereign debt and bans several state-run Russian banks from operating in the United States.
New U.S. sanctions have little impact, but more stringent measures pose credit risks, ratings agency Moody's said in a report released on Monday.
""The negative effects would come first through the monetary policy channel as the Bank of Russia slows policy interest rate cuts – or even hikes rates – due to rising risks for its inflation outlook from a weaker ruble,"" the report said.
Russian stock indexes were mixed.
The dollar-denominated RTS index (IRTS) was down 0.13 percent to 1,082.76 points. The ruble-based MOEX Russian index (IMOEX) was 0.25 percent higher at 2,318.71 points.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar held near a one-month low against a basket of its rivals on Tuesday as a U.S.-Mexico trade deal aimed at overhauling the North American Free Trade Agreement boosted appetite for riskier assets. 
However, market moves were largely limited as some sort of a deal was expected by foreign exchange traders in recent days, with both the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso broadly flat against the greenback.

Despite the dollar's struggles against its major rivals, the euro (EUR=EBS) was broadly steady around $1.1685 after Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio told an Italian paper the country's public deficit could exceed the European Union's ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product.
Among the major losers in the currency markets was sterling as London traders returned after a long weekend to more negative headlines on the Brexit front.

China's offshore yuan  traded about 0.1 percent weaker at 6.8024 per dollar.

The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of other currencies, was up 0.2% to 94.82 by 1:35AM ET (05:35 GMT) after U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled details of the agreement that he says will replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The new deal is expected to last 16 years and will be reviewed every six years pending its approval by Congress, according to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.
The dollar has fallen more than 2% since earlier this month as U.S. President Donald Trump said he was “not thrilled” with the Federal Reserve’s decision to raise rates at a time when the U.S. government was trying to stimulate the economy.
Meanwhile, the Mexican peso closed about 0.8% higher on Monday after initially rising about 1.2% following the announcement of the trade deal.
The USD/CNY pair rose 0.1% to 6.8233, while the offshore yuan traded about 0.1% lower at 6.8017 per dollar.

490,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 12:39AM ET</span>","China raises yuan mid-point most in 15 months, spurs dollar buying","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's central bank raised its daily guidance rate for the yuan by the most in nearly 15 months on Tuesday as part of its latest move to put a floor under the currency as a trade war with the United States grinds on.
But the near 0.7 percent jump in the official mid-point fixing sparked more corporate demand for cheaper dollars, capping the yuan's gains in the spot market. 
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) confirmed market suspicions on Friday by announcing it had started changing the way it calculates the mid-point in August, in a sign authorities are growing wary of letting the yuan weaken further after a record 10 straight weeks of losses.
But market watchers say the yuan will continue to face depreciation pressure as the Sino-U.S. trade battle deepens and China continues to ease policies to support its cooling economy.
Prior to the market opening on Tuesday, the PBOC lifted its official yuan midpoint  to 6.8052 per dollar, 456 pips, or 0.67 percent, firmer than the previous fix of 6.8508 and largely matching market forecasts.
The move in Tuesday's official guidance rate was the biggest one-day strengthening in percentage terms since June 1, 2017.
The guidance rate was 4 pips lower than Reuters' estimate of 6.8048 per dollar.
Market watchers believe the re-introduction of the mysterious ""counter-cyclical factor"" in the PBOC's calculations is largely aimed at steadying the currency, not turning it around. 
""It does not make sense to see a much stronger CNY from both the economic and trade war perspectives. In our view, the CNY's weakness is justified as the economy is still struggling between growth, debt and leveraging,"" Zhou Hao, analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Singapore said in a note.
Recent easing measures in monetary policy also imply a weaker bias for the currency, he said, and added it would not be in China's interest to engineer a firmer yuan while the U.S. trade dispute drags on.
In the spot market, the onshore yuan  opened at 6.8128 per dollar and quickly fell into negative territory. As of 0232 GMT, the onshore yuan traded at 6.8185, 25 pips weaker than the previous late session close.
Its offshore counterpart was trading at 6.8051 per dollar as of 0232 GMT.
Bargain hunting for cheaper dollars remained strong, traders said, as many consider 6.8 per dollar as a hurdle for now.

In global markets, the dollar steadied after falling to a four-week low overnight, as after the United States and Mexico agreed to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement, boosting optimism for an easing of global trade tensions.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority bought HK$2.79 billion ($355 million) of local dollars during New York trading hours on Monday, adding to an earlier purchase of HK$3.93 billion, according to the de facto central bank’s page on Bloomberg. That took its purchases to HK$25.3 billion in August, the first month it has intervened since May. The aggregate balance of the city’s banking system will drop to HK$84.2 billion on Wednesday.
“The weakness is likely driven by carry trade activities, as liquidity in Hong Kong remains ample after the previous interventions this month,” said Carie Li, Hong Kong-based economist at OCBC Wing Hang Bank Ltd. “Given Hong Kong’s strong fundamentals, the market expects flush liquidity to sustain for some time. Moving to September, expectations for a wider interest-rate gap may further encourage carry trade as the Fed is set to raise rates.”
The city’s currency was at 7.8499 per U.S. dollar as of 7:57 a.m. local time. The trading band is HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 versus the greenback. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot index was little changed. One-week Hong Kong dollar interbank borrowing costs declined to below 1 percent for the first time since Aug. 15 on Monday.

492,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 01:07PM ET</span>","Forex - Dollar Downed by Soaring Peso as U.S., Mexico Reach Trade Deal","Investing.com - The dollar fell sharply against its rivals Monday on fading fears over the prospect of a global trade war after the United States and Mexico reached a bilateral deal on NAFTA, paving the way for Canada to rejoin talks.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.47% to 94.63.
President Donald Trump on Monday announced his administration had reached a deal with Mexico on issues that have upended the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the current trade agreement among the U.S., Canada and Mexico, for over a year.
Trump suggested the United States-Mexico Trade Agreement would replace NAFTA, paving the way for Canada to rejoin talks, bringing Trump a step closer to overhauling NAFTA and reducing investor fears over a full-blown trade war.
Trump reportedly warned, however, that if a deal with Canada failed to materialized, then the U.S. would move ahead with tariffs on imported goods from Canada. This would dent the loonie as it throws into doubt expectations about a September rate hike, analysts said.
""By saying Canada could be left out, the US is threatening to take a tough line in those talks,"" CIBC said in a note to clients. ""The scenario poses uncertainty for Canadian economy, and could prompt Bank of Canada to hold off on a rate rise early next month.""
USD/MXN fell 1.12% to 18.71, USD/CAD fell 0.51% to C$1.2961.
Fears over a full-blown trade war had kept demand for the greenback elevated on expectations that the strong U.S. economy would be less troubled from a trade war than that of its rivals.
The dollar's poor start the week comes as analysts warned that investor conviction for the greenback was starting to wane.
Investors' conviction in the strength of the dollar is starting to wane, said TD Securities, citing the recent stream of news flow, including U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's comments at Jackson Hole and recent developments in Washington.
The plunge in the dollar was further compounded by strength in both euro and pound.
EUR/USD rose 0.52% to $1.1684 following better-than-expected business confidence in Germany, the eurozone’s largest economy.
GBP/USD gained 0.31% to $1.2889, although gains in the pair were kept in checked by fears of a no-Brexit deal, which would see the U.K. crash out of the European Union without a trade deal with the member bloc and would likely hurt the U.K. economy.
""It is hard to be positive on sterling or bond yields, especially since we seem to be past the peak in inflation and the effect of Brexit uncertainty on business investment remains unclear,"" said Adrian Hilton, head of global rates and currency investments and fixed income at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.
Easing fears over a global trade war helped the dollar pare some losses against safe-haven yen.
USD/JPY fell 0.19% to Y111.06. The pair traded as low as Y110.52 intraday."
493,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 11:41AM ET</span>","Russian rouble recovers amid weaker U.S. dollar, higher oil","MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian rouble pared losses on Monday helped by a weaker U.S. dollar and higher oil prices, distancing from the pressure of new U.S. sanctions against Moscow.
The dollar was weakening amid news that Mexico and the United States were close to agreement on bilateral issues in the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement that can soften a global trade war risk.
The rouble was trading flat at around at 67.13 versus the dollar as of 1450 GMT , after it briefly touched 69.01 last week, its lowest level since April 2016, due to threats of new U.S. sanctions against Moscow and jitters in other emerging markets.
The rouble was trading 0.5 percent weaker in the early trade on Monday at 67.42 versus the dollar. 
""This rollback of the dollar/rouble is a reaction to forex, where the dollar is again in negative,"" a dealer with a big Russian bank said.
Evgeny Koshelev, an analyst at Rosbank, said the market also did not react to the U.S. sanctions against Russia, tied to a nerve agent attack in Britain, that were expected since the beginning of the month and came into effect on Monday.
A second batch of penalties will be imposed after 90 days unless Russia gives a ""reliable assurance"" that it will not use chemical weapons and will allow on-site inspections by the United Nations or another international observer group.
WATCHING
The market is also watching the situation with a draft bill by U.S. senators that includes restrictions on investment in new Russian sovereign debt and bans several state-run Russian banks from operating in the United States.
The Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Monday Russia has a range of measures it can take in case the United States imposes sanctions on the Russian state debt.
""Until the beginning of September we will not see anything new about the sanction bill,"" the analyst Koshelev said.
He expected the rouble to even strengthen further this week.
The rouble was also supported by the fact that the central bank has eased pressure on the currency by suspending its daily buying of dollars until the end of September.
The rouble was down 0.42 percent versus the euro to 78.28 , losing support from month-end taxes after export-focused companies used the sell-off in the rouble last week to convert dollar revenues at attractive exchange rates to meet local liabilities this week.
The price of oil, Russia's key export, remained supportive for Russian assets, hovering far above levels factored into the budget. Brent crude oil (LCOc1) was up 0.21 percent at $75.99 a barrel. 
The dollar-denominated RTS index (IRTS) was up 1.75 percent to 1,083.2 points, while the rouble-based MOEX Russian index (IMOEX) was 1.18 percent higher at 2,306.6 points.

The neighboring countries came up with a  new agreement in the rengogation of the North American Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
“We will call it the United States-Mexico Trade Agreement,” U.S. President Donald Trump suggested. Discussions with Canada have yet to begin.
All three governments were aiming to make a trade agreement before the end of August.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, remained under pressure after the news, falling 0.38% to 94.72 as of 11:26 AM ET (15:26 GMT).
The Mexican peso surged against the dollar, with USD/MXN slipping 1.45% to 18.6523.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The Turkish lira tumbled nearly 5 percent against the dollar on Monday after a week-long holiday, hit by persistent concern about a diplomatic rift with Washington over a U.S. pastor on trial in Turkey.
The slide left the lira down about 40 percent this year, driven by worries over President Tayyip Erdogan's grip on monetary policy and the stand-off with the United States over the fate of evangelical Christian Andrew Brunson. He is being tried in Turkey on terrorism charges that he denies.
With the dollar stronger globally, the lira  weakened as far as 6.2960 from 6.00 on Friday, when a holiday to mark the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha came to an end. It stood at 6.2100 at 1156 GMT.
""The exchange rate sensitivity created by the tension between us and the United States continues,"" said Seda Yalcinkaya Ozer, an analyst at brokerage Integral, adding that emerging market currencies were generally weaker against the dollar.
The United States and Turkey have exchanged tit-for-tat tariffs on each other's exports over the Brunson dispute. The NATO allies are also at odds over diverging interests in Syria and U.S. objections to Ankara’s ambition to buy Russian defense systems.
Investors are set to turn their attention to a meeting between Finance Minister Berat Albayrak and his French counterpart in Paris, after which they are scheduled to make a statement at 1330 GMT.
In a conference call before the holiday, Albayrak told investors that Turkey would emerge stronger from the crisis, insisting its banks were healthy but that the authorities were ready to provide support to the sector if needed. 
Turkey's central bank and banking watchdog have taken steps to underpin the lira in recent weeks, including cutting limits for Turkish banks' swap transactions. On Monday, the Istanbul stock exchange said it had started work on setting up a swap market as part of efforts to make the city an international finance center.
Investors remain concerned about the lira given Erdogan's opposition to high interest rates and with inflation near 16 percent in July, its highest in more than 14 years.
August inflation data will be released next Monday and the central bank will hold a policy-setting meeting on Sept. 13, having left rates on hold at its last meeting, contrary to expectations. 
Erdogan has cast the lira slide as the result of an ""economic war"" against Turkey, a comment echoed by his spokesman last week when U.S. President Donald Trump ruled out concessions to Ankara in return for Brunson's release.
Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, had said Ankara had made a ""big mistake"" by not freeing Brunson and expressed scepticism about Qatar's offer of $15 billion in investment support for Turkey.

The main BIST 100 share index (XU100) was up 0.7 percent at 1155 GMT. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond (TR10YT=RR) dipped to 21.91 percent from 21.98 percent a week earlier.

496,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 07:09AM ET</span>","Dollar steady after Powell speech, NAFTA hopes lift Mexican peso","By Tom Finn
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar steadied on Monday as risk sentiment improved following reassuring Federal Reserve comments and signs U.S. and Mexican negotiators were homing in on a common position on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
At a symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Fed chair Jerome Powell on Friday emphasized the central bank's push to raise interest rates despite President Donald Trump's criticism of higher borrowing costs. 
The Treasury yield curve reached its flattest level since 2007 - a factor seen as reducing support for the dollar - in the wake of Powell's speech.
His comments did little to change market expectations for rate hikes in September and December and disappointed some dollar bulls hoping for a more hawkish message.
""Some in the market were wrongfooted because they thought the Fed might shift toward an auto-pilot mode (approach to rate hikes) as it did in 2004. Obviously, Powell prefers a gradual approach,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX and emerging market research at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.
""The return of risk appetite is negative for the dollar and its safe-haven appeal.""
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies (DXY) was broadly flat at 95.254 at 1100 GMT, after slipping more than 0.5 percent in the previous session.
Adding to the risk-on mood, U.S. and Mexican trade negotiators appeared close to reaching a common position on NAFTA, with Mexico's economy minister saying on Sunday that talks had ""continued to make progress"".
""There is growing optimism that a US/Mexican agreement can be reached ...which in turn would allow Canada to re-join talks and progress to be made overall,"" said Kit Juckes, foreign exchange strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
""We're never more than a tweet away from disaster on trade negotiations but for now, there's optimism.""
The Mexican peso  was up 0.7 percent at 18.81 per dollar. Talks are scheduled to resume on Monday.
A prospective U.S. deal with Mexico ""takes a little bit of global trade war risk off the table"", said Robert Carnell, chief economist and head of research, Asia-Pacific at ING.
The euro was little changed at $1.1607 (EUR=EBS) after going as high as $1.1654, its strongest since Aug. 2. The single currency advanced more than 0.7 percent on Friday.
The Chinese yuan extended its rally in the onshore market to as high as 6.8061 per dollar , its strongest since Aug. 8. 
The yuan had surged about 0.8 percent in onshore trade on Friday after the People's Bank of China said it was adjusting its methodology for fixing the yuan's daily midpoint, amid broad dollar strength and ongoing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.
In emerging markets, the Turkish lira weakened 3 percent against the dollar on Monday after a week-long holiday, hit by persisting concern about a diplomatic rift with Washington over a detained U.S. pastor.
The slide as local trading resumed left the lira down around 38 percent this year.

A broad retreat in emerging market currencies earlier this month had been a key source of strength for the greenback.

The announcement was seen as the latest signal from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) that is not comfortable with further depreciation in the yuan which could spark capital outflows from the cooling economy.
The move late on Friday came a day after the latest Sino-U.S. talks aimed at resolving the trade dispute ended with little progress, with tougher U.S. measures expected to kick in next month that could add more pressure on the Chinese currency.
President Donald Trump, in an interview with Reuters last week, had accused China of manipulating its currency to help cushion the blow from U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.
Monday's domestic closing price was the strongest since Aug. 1. Spot yuan  opened onshore trade at 6.8080 per dollar and closed domestic trade, at 0830 GMT, at 6.8171, or 19 pips firmer than the previous late night session close. 
""Given China has drawn the line in the sand clearly, the outlook of the yuan may depend on China's economic fundamentals other than the dollar trajectory,"" Tommy Xie, economist at OCBC in Singapore, said in a note. 
""Should China's economy decelerate more than expected, the pressure on RMB weakness may come back again. Otherwise, we expect the USD/CNY to stay below 7 comfortably,"" he said. 
The PBOC said it was adjusting how the yuan's official midpoint was calculated to keep the currency more stable amid dollar strength and trade tensions, but gave no details as to how the new ""X"" factor is derived.
With little sign of compromise in the trade talks, most market watchers had predicted it was only a matter of time before the yuan tested the closely watched and psychologically important support level of 7 to the dollar.
The PBOC's move ""validates our views that yuan devaluation is not a weapon of the trade war,"" Mizuho Bank analysts said in a note.
""It also resonates with our '7-3' stability threshold hypothesis, which refers to not breaching 7 for dollar-yuan and FX reserves not falling below $3 trillion.""
INTRADAY SWINGING
Prior to the market opening on Monday, the PBOC lifted its official yuan midpoint  more than expected to 6.8508 per dollar, 202 pips, or 0.3 percent, firmer than the previous fix of 6.8710 on Friday.
The guidance rate was 127 pips higher than Reuters' estimate of 6.8635 per dollar.
The currency firmed initially in spot trade before swinging between gains and losses.
The offshore counterpart  rose to a high of 6.7818, its strongest since July 31. It traded at 6.8047 as of 0830 GMT.
Traders said the policy move had triggered some dollar selling since Friday night, but gains in the Chinese currency were capped by bargain hunting for cheaper dollars on Monday as many saw strong resistance at 6.8 per dollar for now.
The PBOC introduced the ""X"" factor in May 2017 when the yuan was firming against a weaker dollar. But Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said it has been used in both direction at various times: to slow yuan gains and to curb yuan losses.
TESTING THE WATERS
Traders suspect the PBOC may already have been testing the waters in recent weeks for a re-activation of the measure as the dollar continued to climb. It was last believed to have been used early this year, when the yuan was firming.
U.S. policymakers look set to continue raising interest rates well into next year, supporting the dollar for a while longer, while China recently started shifting to easier conditions to shore up slowing economic growth. 
""How the factor works per se is much less important than the clear signal sent by the PBOC that it would defend 7.0 at least in the next couple of months,"" said Larry Hu, head of greater China economics at Macquarie in Hong Kong.
The yuan had appreciated rapidly in the six months after the counter-cyclical factor was first introduced, Hu said.
Late gains in offshore markets after the announcement on Friday spared the currency from an 11th consecutive weekly loss. But it had already posted the longest such losing streak since the exchange rate was unified in 1994.

As of 0830 GMT, the onshore yuan had weakened 4.6 percent against the dollar this year.

At 5:18 AM ET (9:189 GMT), the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, inched up 0.05% to 95.13, after falling 0.54% on Friday.
The dollar’s decline at the end of last week came as Powell conditioned the Fed’s gradual interest rate increases to a continued strong performance of the U.S. economy and labor market, toning down fears that the U.S. central bank was considering a more aggressive stance on monetary policy.
“As the most recent FOMC statement indicates, if the strong growth in income and jobs continues, further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate,” he concluded.
Meanwhile, the Chinese yuan gave up earlier gains seen on Monday as the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) stepped in to support the currency by re-introducing a counter-cyclical factor to its daily fixing mechanism, lifting its official yuan midpoint more than expected to 6.8508 per dollar.
Monday's official yuan midpoint was 202 pips, or 0.3%, firmer than the previous fix of 6.8710 on Friday.
The PBOC said on Friday that banks would resume using the “counter-cyclical” factor when calculating the yuan’s daily reference rate to support the currency amid broad dollar strength and ongoing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.
China had suspended use of the factor in January, when regulators became more comfortable with the yuan’s strength after several months of gains against the dollar.
The Turkish lira was also back in focus as traders returned from the long Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha last week. USD/TRY jumped 2.63% to 6.1603 as markets continued to center their attention on President Tayyip Erdogan's grip on monetary policy and the standoff with Washington over the fate of pastor Andrew Brunson, under house arrest in Turkey on terrorism charges that he denies.
In his first comments on the currency crisis since before the holiday, Erdogan said on Saturday the commitment and determination of Turks was the guarantee needed to combat attacks on Turkey's economy.
Other currency pairs with the dollar were seeing little movement on Monday. EUR/USD was off just 0.08% at 1.1613. Some observers attributed the modest decline to the euro zone’s exposure to Turkey.
In a light day for economic data, German business morale rose for time this year, improving more than expected and limiting losses in the single currency. ""In addition to a robust domestic economic situation, the truce in the trade conflict with the U.S. contributed to improved business confidence,"" Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said.

The currency dropped as low as 6.0375 per dollar in early Asian trading on renewed concern the nation’s economy will worsen amid a feud with the U.S. and a deepening current-account deficit. The lira then reversed its losses to trade 0.4 percent higher against the greenback as at 7.43 a.m. in Sydney. The currency has slumped slumped 18 percent in August.
“We do not think that Turkey is out of the woods yet,” Jose Wynne, a portfolio manager at hedge fund Man GLG, wrote last week in a note to clients. The bounce in the nation’s assets from the nadir on Aug. 13 was “mostly driven by an engineered technical squeeze in the Turkish lira as opposed to fundamental developments,” he said.
The lira has been the whipping boy of investors dismayed over the local economy and sanctions imposed by the U.S. following the imprisonment of an American pastor. While the central bank has raised interest rates by 5 percentage points since April to stabilize markets, it may need to boost them a lot further to stem the rout, according to  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA.
The turmoil is part of an “explicit economic attack” by Washington, according to the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, which has resisted pressure to keep raising borrowing costs in order to support economic growth.
Turkey’s 10-year bond yields climbed to a record 21.5 percent earlier this month as investors dumped the nation’s debt. Five-year credit-default swaps -- the cost to insure the bonds against default -- surged to 573 basis points before dropping to 477 basis points on Friday, CMA data showed.

502,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 26, 2018 05:56AM ET</span>",Forex - Weekly Outlook: August 27 - 31,"Investing.com - With another fairly light week on the economic calendar investors will continue to monitor developments on the U.S. political front after a bruising week for President Donald Trump, following the criminal conviction of two associates.
Tuesday’s U.S. trade data will be in focus after US-China trade talks ended with little progress and both countries slapped fresh reciprocal tariffs on imports.
Investors will also be eyeing a revision to second quarter U.S. GDP data due out on Wednesday. Growth is expected to be revised down to 4% from the initial estimate of 4.1%, but that would still represent the fastest pace of growth in four years.
Canadian data on second quarter growth on Thursday is expected to show that the economy gathered momentum, which would bolster expectations for a September rate hike by the country’s central bank.
The dollar fell on Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in a closely watched speech at the central bank’s annual gathering at Jackson Hole, Wyo. that he expects to see further interest rate increases, but suggested that the Fed funds rate was getting closer to neutral.
Once interest rates reach a neutral equilibrium, where they neither stimulate nor suppress the economy the Fed can cease hiking rates.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.49% at 95.08 late Friday. The index ended the week down 0.96%, its second consecutive weekly decline.
The dollar had been boosted by safe haven demand amid escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China and after Wednesday’s Fed minutes, which underlined expectations for a September rate hike.
Officials from the U.S. and China ended two days of trade talks on Thursday without making any major progress. The talks ended as a new round of U.S. tariffs kicked in on $16 billion worth of imports from China, followed immediately by reciprocal tariffs from Beijing.
The dollar was little changed against the yen late Friday, with USD/JPY at 111.26.
The euro gained ground against the softer dollar, with EUR/USD advancing 0.72% to 1.1622.
The pound fell to its lowest level against the euro in almost a year Friday as concerns over the prospects of a no-deal Brexit continued to weigh. EUR/GBP was up 0.43% to 0.9045 in late trade.
Meanwhile, the Australian dollar rebounded, with AUD/USD up 1.08% to 0.7325 as concerns over domestic political uncertainty eased after the ruling Liberal party elected a new leader.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of significant events likely to affect the markets.

503,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar Down as Powell Pedals Gradual Rate-Hike Narrative,"Investing.com - The dollar fell sharply against its rivals Friday as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said there were no ""clear signs"" of an elevated risk of the economy overheating, affirming expectations that the gradual pace of rate hikes would continue.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.55% to 95.02.
Powell, in support of the Fed's glacial approach to tightening, underlined two risks facing the economy. He said too fast a pace of tightening could ""needlessly"" undermine economy growth, while too slow a pace would risk the economy overheating.
“I see the current path of gradually raising interest rates as the [Federal Open Market Committee’s] approach to taking seriously both of these risks.” Powell said in speech at Jackson Hole, Wyo.
Analysts touted a far more dovish scenario for monetary policy, citing a risk of slowing rate hikes should inflation remain grounded.
""While the Fed is on its one-hike-per-quarter path this year, should inflation stay relatively grounded, the balance of risk approach that Powell talks about could lean towards a somewhat slower pace of tightening in 2019, as rates get closer to where the Fed might see the neutral rate lying,"" CIBC said.
Powell's speech largely overshadowed data showing core durable goods orders undershot expectations, though analysts were quick to downplay the weakness as the underlying data indicated strong capital expenditure growth.
The Commerce Department said on Friday core durable goods orders fell 0.2% last month, missing economists' forecast for a 0.5% rise. But non-defense ex-air orders grew 1.4%, above economists' estimates.
""The (headline number) 1.7% decline was driven by a huge dive in the always choppy aircraft component, a segment in which orders go with a long lag towards actual activity. Core capital goods (non-defense ex aircraft) saw orders up a healthy 1.4%, continuing their nice uptrend and signaling gains in business investment spending,"" CIBC said.
The fall in the dollar kept it on track for a second weekly drop in a row, as market participants dived into the euro and sterling.
EUR/USD rose 0.75%, while GBP/USD gained 0.31% to 1.2855. Both pairs are set to post a weekly gain.
USD/JPY fell 0.10% to Y111.19, from a session high of Y111.48.
Elsewhere, USD/CAD fell 0.47% to C$1.302 as a rally in oil prices supported the loonie, keeping a lid on gains in the pair."
504,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",PBOC Joins Forces With Powell to Hit the Brakes on Dollar Rally,"(Bloomberg) -- The People’s Bank of China and Federal Reserve delivered a one-two punch to the dollar Friday, spurring the biggest selloff in a month and raising the specter of further weakness ahead.
The PBOC announced that banks would resume a “counter-cyclical” factor when calculating the yuan’s daily reference rate, restraining the influence of market forces that have been driving the currency lower versus the greenback. Roughly three hours later, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell gave foreign-exchange traders another reason to sell the dollar, saying he sees little sign of inflation accelerating above the central bank’s 2 percent target.
China’s fixing adjustment in tandem with Powell’s dovish tone on price pressures fueled a decline of as much as 0.7 percent for the greenback Friday. The PBOC move to inject stability into the dollar-yuan rate will reverberate across the emerging-market currency landscape, slowing further greenback gains, according to Brad Bechtel, a managing director at Jefferies Group LLC.
“Any dollar-yuan rallies will be a lot less punchy and a lot more gradual, so it will have a dampening effect,” Bechtel said. “It provides stability to the entire Asian-EM complex. It does help cap the rally in the dollar, or at least stall it.”
The yuan has slid more than 6 percent against the greenback since mid-June as the two countries square off in a protracted trade war, helping fuel broad dollar gains and stoking the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump. The PBOC last introduced a counter-cyclical factor to the yuan’s fixing in May 2017, helping spark a 3.5 percent decline in the dollar over the remainder of the year.
Beijing had suspended use of the factor in January, a move interpreted to mean that policy makers had grown more comfortable with the yuan’s trajectory after several months of gains against the dollar.
The offshore yuan rallied as much as 1.4 percent Friday to 6.80 per dollar, the most since January 2016.
Friday’s move comes after two days of U.S.-China trade negotiations. While talks concluded with no clear resolution, the timing suggests that perhaps China agreed to “behave a little better on the currency front,” according to Bechtel. Heading into the meeting, Trump had repeatedly accused China of manipulating the yuan.
“I’m not sure it’ll be enough the ease the tensions, but it’s an olive branch none the less,” Bechtel said."

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, decreased 0.51% to 95.06 as of 10:25 AM ET (14:25 GMT).
In a speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday, Powell cautioned against hiking interest rates too quickly.
“I see the current path of gradually raising interest rates as the FOMC's approach to taking seriously both of these risks,” he stated.
The Fed kept rates unchanged at its last meeting in August but is expected to increase rates at least two times before the end of the year.
The greenback was also held back by news that the U.S. and China went ahead with 25% tariffs on $16 billion worth of each other's goods, as trade talks between the two ended with no agreement. The two biggest economies in the world have been in a tit-for-tat trade war for months.
The dollar was lower against the safe-haven yen, with USD/JPY decreasing 0.09% to 111.19. In times of uncertainty, investors tend to invest in the Japanese yen, which is considered a safe asset during periods of risk aversion.

506,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 07:42AM ET</span>",Turkish lira firms against dollar as U.S. standoff drags on,"By Daren Butler
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The Turkish lira firmed against the dollar on Friday after weakening in thin holiday trade this week, as a bitter standoff dragged on between Ankara and Washington over the fate of an American pastor being tried in Turkey.
The lira  firmed to 6.0550 against the U.S. currency from a close of 6.0950, having weakened 1 percent on Thursday after Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's spokesman accused the United States of waging ""economic war"".
Trading volumes were thin and probably largely offshore as Turkish markets have been closed since Monday for the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha. They will reopen on Monday. The lira closed at 6.01 last week.
""We do expect pressures to resume, most likely next week. This is the quiet before the storm,"" said Jakob Christensen, head of EM research at Danske Bank.
""We see the measures put in place ahead of the holiday last week as more like temporary relief measures rather than dealing with the symptoms of the crisis,"" he said.
Despite central bank and banking watchdog steps to underpin the lira, it has weakened 37 percent against the dollar this year. The crisis is rooted in investor concern over Erdogan's influence on monetary policy and fueled by the deepening row with the United States.
""We really need some more substantial measures from Turkey before we call the crisis as over,"" Christensen said. 
In a conference call last week, Finance Minister Berat Albayrak assured investors that Turkey would emerge stronger from the crisis, insisting its banks were healthy but being ready to provide support to the sector if needed.
POLICY RESPONSE
One focus of interest for investors will be Turkey's medium-term program for the economy, which Albayrak said he would announce in the first half of September.
Also looming is a central bank policy-setting meeting on Sept. 13. When it last met in July, the bank left rates on hold, contrary to expectations, in its first policy decision since Erdogan was re-elected with new executive powers.
Erdogan wants lower borrowing costs to boost growth and investors worry that his influence over monetary policy is weakening the bank's ability to fight inflation, which neared 16 percent in July, its highest in more than 14 years.
On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump ruled out concessions to Ankara in return for the release of pastor Andrew Brunson, who is being tried in Turkey on terrorism charges. Trump's national security adviser John Bolton said Ankara had made a ""big mistake"" by not freeing Brunson.
Erdogan spokesman Ibrahim Kalin responded by saying Washington must respect the legal process concerning the pastor and that Bolton's remarks showed the United States was targeting Turkey's economy.

Bolton had said he was skeptical about $15 billion of investment support from Qatar, saying it was ""utterly insufficient to have an impact on Turkey's economy"".

The Aussie tumbled Thursday as Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull fought to stave off a challenge from the conservative wing of his own party. Already the nation’s sixth leader since 2007, Turnbull said he would only step aside if his chief rival Peter Dutton proves he has enough support to unseat him.
“What we’re seeing in the forex markets reflects a crisis of confidence in the ability of Australia’s political class to deliver sensible economic outcomes that ensure our future prosperity,” said Stephen Miller, an adviser at Grant Samuel Funds Management and former head of fixed income at BlackRock Investment Management Australia. “I can see the Aussie testing 70 U.S. cents at some stage before year’s end.”
Australia’s dollar has weakened more than 10 percent from this year’s high of 81.36 cents set in January to trade at 72.94 cents at 5 p.m. in Sydney on Thursday. The currency was last below 70 cents in early 2016.
Miller is voicing the view of a growing pool of money managers who are becoming increasingly bearish on the Aussie as a power struggle once again disrupts the process of government. The currency was already under pressure due to the trade dispute between Australia’s largest trading partner China and the U.S., and a widening interest-rate differential in favor of the greenback.
Turnbull, who himself overthrew former Prime Minister Tony Abbott in 2015, said he would call a special meeting of the governing Liberal Party at noon on Friday if Dutton can gather enough signatures on a petition. If lawmakers hold a leadership vote, which would be the second this week, Turnbull said he wouldn’t stand.
Political Mayhem
The Aussie will probably decline to around 71.25 cents as the crisis worsens and other macro factors weigh in, said Chris Manuell, a portfolio manager at Jamieson Coote Bonds in Melbourne. “We would anticipate one last leg lower into that region and be alert for a tradeable bounce around that area.”
The Aussie is taking the brunt of the political mayhem that makes Italian politics look almost sedate, he said.
Not every asset manager is bearish. The Aussie is trading at fair value and will probably stay above 70 cents, said Raymond Lee, a money manager and managing director at Kapstream Capital in Sydney.
“We’re not shorting the Aussie at the moment,” he said. “It’s difficult to trade around political news in the short term. I think this will be short-term noise.”
Australia’s currency is likely to stay under pressure until there’s some clarity on new leadership or a date for the next election, said Kerry Craig, a global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in Melbourne.
“Markets hate uncertainty, but that’s what we’ve got, the currency is likely to feel the pressure the most,” he said.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.45% to 95.42. The dollar was set to snap a five-day losing streak.
The wobble in U.S. housing market continued after sales of new homes in the U.S. unexpectedly fell in July to a 9-month low. Rising building material costs and a shortages of land and labor have tightened the supply of houses available for sale, keeping prices elevated and deterring buyers.
The Commerce Department said Thursday new home sales fell 1.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 627,000 units last month, the lowest level since October 2017. That missed economists’ forecasts.
The housing market data arrived as investors were digesting a fresh round of tariffs between the U.S. and China on each other's goods that went into effect Thursday, prompting investors to back the dollar amid a strong U.S. economy.
The greenback was also supported by ongoing expectations that the Federal Reserve will meet expectations and raise interest rates next month.

Further clues on monetary policy may arrive on Friday courtesy of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who is on the slate to deliver a speech at in Jackson Hole, Wyo.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.28% to 95.26 by 10:05 AM ET (14:06 GMT), snapping six days of losses. The index hit a low of 94.83 the previous day, its lowest since August 8.
Political risks surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump mounted as the criminal conviction of two of his former associates this week raised questions over whether he will remain in office.
Renewed worries about U.S. - China trade tensions also supported safe haven demand for the dollar.
A new round of U.S. tariffs on $16 billion of imports from China took effect on Thursday, followed immediately by Beijing imposing retaliatory tariffs on the same amount of U.S. imports to China.
The tit-for-tat trade spat between the world’s two largest economies continues even as representatives from both countries are engaged in low level talks in the U.S.
Earlier this week, Trump played down the prospects of any imminent success from the discussions, saying that he didn’t “anticipate much” of an outcome.
Demand for the dollar was also underpinned after the latest Federal Reserve minutes indicated that plans for additional rate hikes this year remain on track.
The Fed minutes also showed that officials discussed how global trade disputes could affect businesses and households.
The Fed has raised rates twice this year and is expected to raise rates again next month and one more time this year.

ANKARA/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The lira weakened further on Thursday, pressured by a damaging standoff between Turkey and the United States over the fate of a detained Christian pastor that showed no signs of easing.
Ankara accused Washington of waging ""economic war"" and failing to respect its legal system over Andrew Brunson, whose trial in Turkey on terrorism charges - which he denies - has soured ties between the NATO allies.
The lira  dipped as far as 6.1350 against the dollar from a close of 6.0330 and was at 6.0700 at 0914 GMT, 0.6 percent weaker on the day. The dollar was boosted by U.S. Federal Reserve minutes indicating it would raise interest rates in September. 
The lira is down 37 percent this year, with the crisis in Turkish-U.S. relations exacerbating losses triggered by concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan's influence over monetary policy.
Cristian Maggio, head of emerging markets strategy at TD Securities, said trading volumes were particularly thin as markets were closed in Turkey all week for the Muslim Eid al-Adha festival.
""The problems of Turkey are not fixed,"" he said. ""There is not one single structural solution or reform that has been advanced or detailed by the local authorities.""
Erdogan's spokesman told Reuters overnight that comments by President Donald Trump's national security adviser showed the United States was targeting Turkey's economy.
John Bolton told Reuters that Turkey had made a ""big mistake"" in not freeing Brunson, and was skeptical about $15 billion of investment support from Qatar, which was ""utterly insufficient to have an impact on Turkey's economy"".
""His statement is proof that the Trump administration is targeting a NATO ally as part of an economic war,"" Erdogan's spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said.
""The Trump administration has ... established that it intends to use trade, tariffs and sanctions to start a global trade war.""
Bolton said the crisis could be over ""instantly"" if Turkey released Brunson, prompting Kalin to call on Washington to respect Turkey's judicial independence, one of Ankara's most pointed responses yet to criticism of the pastor's detention. 
Brunson, who has lived in Turkey for two decades, has been detained for 21 months and is now under house arrest.
""RESTRICTIVE AND PUNITIVE""
Until Kalin's statement, Turkish officials had been silent about comments on Turkey this week by Trump and Bolton. Trump told Reuters on Monday he would give no concessions in return for Brunson's release.
As relations soured this month, Trump doubled tariffs on metal imports from Turkey, prompting Ankara to raise tariffs on U.S. car, alcohol and tobacco imports by the same amount.
Ankara has initiated a WTO dispute complaint on the tariffs.
""Turkey will protect its national interests on every platform and work with the rest of the world against restrictive and punitive measures,"" Kalin said.
Qatar's support has had a positive impact on markets and Turkey's ties with it would continue to strengthen, he said.
""The steps we have taken to prevent an assault on the Turkish lira yielded positive results"" and the Finance Ministry and other institutions will continue to ""take precautions and protect our economy"", Kalin added.
Maggio highlighted market concerns that Turkey's central bank has not been hiking interest rates despite double-digit inflation and the ailing lira. Erdogan has called interest rates the ""mother and father of all evil"", seeking lower borrowing rates to boost growth.
""They just squeezed liquidity out of the market but now they have started to reduce that squeeze, which is removing the support the lira received,"" said Maggio. ""I would be very surprised to see a sustained rally in the lira.""
Kalin also said Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a banker at Turkey's state-owned Halkbank (IS:HALKB), had been unjustly convicted in the United States for taking part in a scheme to help Iran evade U.S. sanctions. Atilla was sentenced to 32 months in jail in May.
""It is unacceptable that certain baseless and false allegations are made against Halkbank to weaken this public bank,"" Kalin added.

""Turkey is extremely frustrated with this process.""

515,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 04:32AM ET</span>","Forex - Dollar Higher after Fed Minutes, Aussie Tumbles","Investing.com - The dollar was broadly higher against currency basket on Thursday after the latest Federal Reserve meeting minutes indicated that further interest rate hikes are in the pipeline, while the Australian dollar weakened amid domestic political turmoil.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.34% to 95.32 by 04:31 AM ET (08:31 AM GMT). The index hit a low of 94.83 the previous day, its lowest since August 8.
The dollar was boosted after Fed policymakers said they continued to expect the U.S. economy to expand at an above-trend pace, prompting the need for further rate hikes.
The Fed minutes also showed that officials discussed how global trade tensions could affect businesses and households.
The Fed has raised rates twice this year and is expected to continue doing so, with another two hikes expected before the years end.
The greenback received an additional boost from political turmoil in Australia, which pressured the Aussie lower.
Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was clinging to power after a number of senior government ministers resigned amid a leadership crisis in the ruling Liberal party.
AUD/USD was down 0.82% to 0.7290, re-approaching the nineteen-month trough of 0.7201 reached on August 15.
Concerns over political risks surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump following the criminal conviction of two associates, and worries about U.S.- China trade tensions also supported safe haven demand for the dollar.
A new round of U.S. tariffs on $16 billion of imports from China took effect on Thursday, followed immediately by Beijing imposing retaliatory tariffs on $16 billion of U.S. imports to China.
The tit-for-tat trade spat continues as representatives from both countries engage in low level talks in the U.S.
The dollar was higher against the yen, with USD/JPY rising 0.22% to 110.79.
The euro was lower against the firmer dollar, with EUR/USD down 0.35% to 1.1554.
In the euro zone, data on Thursday showed that euro zone private sector activity continued to grow in August, albeit at a slower rate than expected.
Meanwhile, expectations for future growth fell to the lowest level for almost two years, with the prospects of a trade war hitting the outlook for manufacturers.
The pound was lower against the firmer dollar, with GBP/USD down 0.4% to 1.2856 as the prospect of a no-deal Brexit continued to weigh."

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar snapped a five-day losing streak and the euro fell on Thursday, with the greenback boosted by political uncertainty, a new round of trade tariffs and the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting minutes that signaled a September rate rise.
While the minutes were largely as expected and initially taken as dovish by the market, analysts said dollar bulls had been looking for an excuse to pile back into the greenback after it had lost more than 2 percent from 14-month highs during its longest losing streak of the year.
The United States and China escalated their months-long trade war, implementing punitive 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion worth of each other's goods, rattling investors who have usually sought safety in the dollar.
The greenback also found support after the Fed's minutes showed officials discussed raising rates soon.
""I think the market has been waiting for the moment to get back in (to the dollar),"" said Neil Mellor, a strategist at BNY Mellon.
The dollar index (DXY) gained 0.2 percent to 95.334, moving off a near-three-week low of 94.934 reached overnight.
The euro was down about 0.3 percent at $1.1569 (EUR=), easing from a two-week high of $1.1623. Traders are preparing for purchasing managers' surveys at 0800 GMT to gauge the health of the euro zone economy in August. 
""I'm still not fully convinced we have a sustained dollar rally here, especially after Mr Trump's comments,"" Mellor said, referring to President Donald Trump's criticism of the Fed's rate hikes in an interview this week with Reuters.
The Australian dollar dropped 0.8 percent to $0.7294  as Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's position looked in trouble after his senior ministers called for a second leadership vote.
The Australian dollar typically ignores Australian politics, analysts said.
""Since the Liberal leadership spill on Tuesday, the Australian dollar is easily the weakest G10 currency - despite strong Q2 construction data on Wednesday - which suggests that this is a rare instance of the Aussie carrying a small political risk premium,"" said Sydney-based Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at Westpac.
The yen  fell 0.3 percent to 110.85 versus the dollar on safe-haven demand for the dollar.
The Fed's minutes showed that officials had examined how global trade disputes could affect businesses and households, suggesting that the market's perceived path for monetary tightening could have to change if the trade conflict upsets the U.S. economy.
Dealers said domestic political pressure on Trump - exacerbated this week with news that two of his former advisers face prison sentences - would weigh on the dollar.
The offshore yuan  slid 0.3 percent to 6.8695 yuan per dollar after the latest round of tariffs took effect. 

The Swiss franc gained 0.2 percent to 1.1380 francs per euro (EURCHF=), ending its recent run of losses. The franc hit a near 13-month high of 1.1244 earlier in August.

517,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 03:10AM ET</span>",Currency That Matters Most Is Still the U.S. Dollar,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Turkey is grabbing headlines, but its financial troubles aren’t unique.
The underlying driver of Turkey’s economic crisis is not the detention of an American pastor or President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s opposition to higher interest rates. It’s the steady upward march of U.S. interest rates.
Behind the slide in the lira and pressure on emerging markets, generally, is a lopsided monetary world. The dollar is still the FX superpower. As long as the Federal Reserve keeps raising interest rates further and faster than anyone else, the developing world is going to be pinched. The differences between Turkey and the rest are of degree, not kind.
Don’t expect Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to flag a big change of course at the central bank’s Jackson Hole retreat this week. He may acknowledge difficulties abroad, but his focus is on the U.S., and the strength of the domestic economy doesn’t justify a halt in rate hikes at this time. 
China’s rise and global antipathy toward President Donald Trump have done nothing to dent the financial supremacy of the American dollar. Despite perennial predictions of the dollar’s eclipse, it accounts for more than 60 percent of global reserves. The euro, which was supposed to rival the greenback, makes up about 20 percent. China’s yuan, which was added to the International Monetary Fund’s reserve basket with great fanfare a few years ago, is 1.4 percent.
The dollar was on one side of almost 90 percent of foreign-exchange transactions, according to the Bank for International Settlements. The yuan is making progress, but remains under 5 percent.
What does China have to do with Turkey? China is often seen as a proxy for emerging markets and challengers to American financial supremacy. China has made enormous strides and is starting to behave like a stabilizer in world affairs, rather than a disrupter. Its leaders have been careful to respond proportionately and not provocatively to Trump’s trade broadsides. But for all that and all the predictions of China’s ultimate economic dominance, its capital markets are small relative to the U.S. The greenback still rules.
When U.S. interest rates are low or declining, capital generally tends to flow to emerging markets where risks are greater and expected returns are better. When the Fed raises rates and Western central banks withdraw stimulus, emerging markets are vulnerable. That’s the current against which Turkey is swimming.
All this isn’t to say that a unipolar financial world is a good thing. Or that it will last forever. The past decade shows that America’s banks can crash just like an emerging market and be bailed out. (Malaysia’s former — and recently returned — leader, Mahathir Mohamad, was prescient about that.) And for all its strengths, the Fed has made some big mistakes over the years. 
China’s influence in capital markets will also grow over time. As its gross domestic product approaches that of the U.S., China will require a financial system and central bank befitting that sheer size.
Until then, the dollar is king."
518,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 01:50AM ET</span>",Investors trim bearish bets on most Asian currencies as Sino-U.S. trade tensions ease: Reuters poll,"By Aditya Soni
(Reuters) - Investors have trimmed their short positions on Asian currencies over the last two weeks, a Reuters poll showed, as a weaker dollar, coupled with optimism over Sino-U.S. trade tensions and tightening monetary policy in the region improved risk appetite.
Bearish bets on the Chinese yuan <CNY=CFXS> were sharply reduced in the wake of the latest round of Sino-U.S. trade talks, the survey showed. Short positions fell to their lowest since late-May, when bets on the Chinese currency were slightly bullish.
""At least they are talking, that's the bottom line and the fact that they're talking itself has been taken as a positive,"" said Sim Moh Siong, FX Strategist at Bank of Singapore.
The poll of 10 market participants also showed that investors trimmed their short positions on four other Asian currencies.
The broad lift in sentiment towards emerging Asian currencies came on rising optimism over ongoing U.S.-China trade talks, and after U.S. President Donald Trump's critique of Federal Reserve's interest-rate hike cycle led to a weakness in the dollar.
Risk appetite was also bolstered by policy responses from several Asian central banks.
Earlier this month, Philippine central bank made its biggest rate hike in 10 years - raising key interest rates by 50 basis points - and left the door open for further policy tightening. The poll showed short positions in the Philippine peso <PHP=> narrowed to levels last seen in mid-May.
Short positions on the Thai baht <THB=TH> also hit their lowest since May-end, bolstered by hawkish comments from the central bank governor.
This week, Bank of Thailand Governor Veerathai Santiprabhob said the country cannot buck the global policy tightening trend but noted any interest rate hike would be gradual.
""I think the response of the regional central banks has been in the right direction,"" said Bank of Singapore's Sim.
""Whether the currencies can stabilize ultimately depends on the outcome of the China-U.S. trade tensions but at least on the part of the individual countries within the region, policy makers are stepping up to the plate.""
Export-driven South Korean won <KRW=KFTC> and Taiwan dollar <TWD=TP> saw bearish positions fall to their lowest since May and mid-July, respectively.
However, investors raised short positions on the Indonesian rupiah <IDR=ID>, Indian rupee <INR=IN> and Singapore dollar <SGD=>.
Indonesia's central bank raised interest rates for the fourth time since mid-May last week, in an effort to defend a beleaguered currency.
The rupiah has lost nearly 7 percent since this beginning of the year, making it second-worst performing Asian currency so far.
The Indonesian currency has been hit with a combination of a rising trade deficit, worsening macro trade conditions and lower growth outlook.
Meanwhile, short positions on the Singapore dollar hit their highest since late June.
Singapore's economy grew slower than initial estimates in the April-June period on a quarter-on-quarter basis, as the government flagged a likely moderation in growth in the second half.
Short positions on the Indian rupee, the worst performing Asian currency so far this year, also rose.
The rupee hit an all time low on 69.62 per dollar on August 13. India faces significant headwinds as rising oil prices could spur its trade deficit and prop up inflation, which remains a central concern.
Last week, India's Statistics Ministry said that retail inflation numbers eased in July but remained over central bank's target medium-term target of 4 percent.
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3.
A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars. The figures included positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, gained 0.4% to 95.34 by 12:55AM ET (04:55 GMT).
The index received some support as the Federal Reserve said in its most recent policy meeting that it is ready to hike rates again as long as the U.S. economy remains healthy, “Many participants suggested that if incoming data continued to support their current economic outlook, it would likely soon be appropriate to take another step in removing policy accommodation,” minutes of the July 31-Aug. 1 Federal Open Market Committee meeting released Wednesday in Washington said.
The minutes then added that “further gradual increases” in their target rate “would be consistent with a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committee’s symmetric 2% objective over the medium term.”
Meanwhile, the Australian dollar fell as Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was dealt a blow to his leadership.
The AUD/USD pair fell 1.0% to 0.7290 and slid to near the lowest level this week as Turnbull’s leadership appeared to be in question after three senior ministers tendered their resignations and called for a second leadership vote.
Finance Minister Mathias Cormann resigned and said on Thursday that he believed former Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton is the best person to lead the government. ""I can't ignore reality,"" Cormann said. ""I can't ignore the fact that a majority of colleagues in the Liberal Party... are of the view that there should be a change,"" he said.

Michael Cohen on Tuesday said Trump paid him to buy the silence of women during the 2016 election campaign.
Trump responded to the allegation on Wednesday, claiming Cohen had fabricated his testimony. “Unlike Michael Cohen, he (Paul Manafort) refused to ‘break’ --make up stories in order to get a ‘deal,’"" Trump said in a tweet.
Investor focus could shift away from the political turmoil in Washington to monetary policy, as the Federal Reserve releases the minutes of its July 31- Aug.1 meeting. The minutes could provide clues as to the Fed's plan on future rate hikes.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The under-pressure lira held steady against the dollar on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump's national security adviser said Turkey had made a ""big mistake"" in not freeing a U.S. pastor held on terrorism charges.
The lira has lost 37 percent of its value this year in a crisis triggered by concerns over President Tayyip Erdogan's influence on monetary policy and excerbated by the dispute with Washington. 
U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton told Reuters during a visit to Israel that Ankara ""made a big mistake in not releasing Pastor (Andrew) Brunson"".
The case was likely to continue to add to the lira's woes, said Per Hammarlund, chief emerging markets strategist at SEB.
""Ultimately, they will release Brunson but it will take a while and as long as there is a risk to U.S. dollar flows to Turkish banks or to Turkey in general, then the lira will be under pressure,"" Hammarlund said.
""I wouldn't be surprised if we see another bout of volatility in the lira and a sharp weakening again.""
The lira stood at 6.0820 at 0933 GMT, compared with a close of 6.0600 on Tuesday. Trade was thinner than usual and probably mainly offshore after Turkish markets closed at midday on Monday for a week's holiday to mark the Muslim Eid al-Adha festival.
HOUSE ARREST
Brunson, who has lived in Turkey for two decades, has been detained for 21 months on terrorism charges, which he denies, and is now under house arrest.
Trump, who counts evangelical Christians among his core supporters, has become a vocal champion of the pastor's case. 
""Every day that goes by that mistake continues, this crisis could be over instantly if they did the right thing as a NATO ally, part of the West, and release (him)... without condition,"" Bolton told Reuters.
Brunson's lawyer said he planned to appeal to the constitutional court for the pastor's release, after being rejected by a lower court last week.
A court in Turkey's Izmir province rejected the appeal for release, saying evidence was still being collected and the pastor posed a flight risk.

In an interview with Reuters on Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would give Turkey no concessions in return for the release of Brunson. Ankara has not responded to Trump's comments.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.40% to 95.31, a nearly two-week low.
In an interview with Reuters on Monday, Trump said he was ""not thrilled"" with Jerome Powell's rate hikes and called on the U.S. central bank to do more to boost the economy.
The dollar retreated on the comments despite many expecting it unlikely that Powell would succumb to pressure from the Trump administration to halt the pace of rate hikes.
The Federal Reserve has projected four hikes for this year, with the third rate hike expected as soon as September.
The slump in the dollar helped the euro add to gains, which had followed a firmer Turkish Lira and a decrease in Italian bonds yields to below 3%, pointing to easing concerns somewhat about Italy's upcoming budget.
Italy's new populist government has promised to deliver a big spending plan, but market participants are sceptical as to how the country will be able to finance those plans. Moody's delayed its decision to downgrade Italy's debt on Monday, lifting sentiment.

528,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2018 09:21AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Britain extends lead as king of currencies despite Brexit vote,"By Andrew MacAskill and Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has extended its lead in the global currency trading business in the two years since it voted to leave the European Union, in another sign London is likely to continue to be one of the world's top two financial centers even after Brexit.
Leaving the European Union was supposed to deal a crippling blow to London's position in global finance, prompting a mass exodus of jobs and business. But with eight months to go, London has tightened rather than weakened its grip on foreign exchange trading, a Reuters analysis shows.
Foreign exchange - the largest and most interconnected of global markets, used by everyone from global airlines to money managers in transactions worth trillions of dollars a day - is the crowning jewel of London's financial services industry.
Reuters' analysis, based on surveys released by central banks in the five biggest trading centers, shows forex trading volumes in Britain had grown by 23 percent to a record daily average of $2.7 trillion in April compared to April 2016.
That was double the pace of its nearest rival, the United States, which was up 11 percent to $994 billion, mostly out of New York. 
That means about two-fifths of all trades are handled in Britain, nearly all of them in London - a daily volume almost equivalent to the annual economic output of the United Kingdom.
The next three biggest markets are Singapore, which fell by 5 percent to $523 billion; Hong Kong, which grew 10 percent to $482 billion; and Japan, which increased by 2 percent to $415 billion.
London has dominated the foreign exchange market for nearly half a century. 
Investment banks earned $4.2 billion in revenues from foreign exchange business globally in the first quarter of 2018, about 12.5 percent of all revenues in their global markets divisions, according to data from industry analytics firm Coalition.
While forex trading reaps relatively low margins, it brings in other business, allowing lenders to cross-sell other services such as interest-rate products, equity and bond issuance and advice on mergers and acquisitions, said former currency trader Keith Pilbeam, now a professor at the Cass Business School.
""It is all about getting people in,"" Pilbeam said. ""Selling forex is the best introduction to a company because you are talking to the treasurers of these companies.""
Bankers and traders attribute an overall growth in trading to global political uncertainty, including around Brexit itself. They also cite the presidency of Donald Trump and the threat of trade wars involving the United States, China and the EU.
London's time zone between the United States and Asia means it is well placed in times of global turbulence, they said.
Increased volumes help the biggest players because investors want to buy and sell in markets that have the capacity to absorb large deals without significantly affecting prices.
Finally, London's advanced FX trading hardware and high-speed sub-Atlantic cables to New York make it costly and troublesome for forex operations to move, they said, especially given that banks have a tendency to want to group together. 
""The luck of geography has helped because most of the big market moving news, whether in the U.S. or Europe, has occurred during London's trading hours,"" said Neil Jones, London-based head of hedge fund sales at Japan's Mizuho Bank.
""You may have all the uncertainty around Brexit, but this is outweighed by London's time zone, its language, and the advantages that come from having the biggest market.""
BREXIT BATTLEGROUND
The forex industry has emerged as a battleground between Britain and the EU in negotiations on what will replace current treaties and agreements after Brexit day on March 29, 2019. 
Some EU leaders want to strip banks in Britain of the right to sell FX derivative products, which allow investors to hedge against swings in the price of currencies, to EU-based clients. 
These products, the largest part of Britain's currency market, are sold to customers around the world, not just the EU.
Banks in Britain, including the London operations of global players, are moving some staff to European cities on expectations that they will the lose the automatic right to sell services to EU investors after Brexit.
Companies that run trading platforms, such as Thomson Reuters (TO:TRI) - the parent of Reuters News - and NEX Group (L:NXGN) are shifting parts of their businesses to Dublin and Amsterdam to prepare for life after Brexit.  
But Brexit supporters say the threat of job losses in Britain's financial services industry has been exaggerated.
Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore had been eroding London's dominance before the June referendum, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) said in its last major three-year survey of global forex activity in September 2016.
The city's tightening grip on forex trade does not prove London won't suffer from Brexit, but it does underscore the attractiveness for banks of maintaining large international operations in the city, industry experts said. 
""In order for London to be replaced there needs to be an alternative venue and there isn't one,"" said Alexander McDonald, the chief executive of industry group European Venues and Intermediaries Association. 
""The FX market is effectively an offshore dollar market and offshore dollars are always going to be looking for an international home, and that's London.""

529,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2018 07:41AM ET</span>","Trump vows 'no concessions', Turkey's lira stays under pressure","By Daren Butler
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The lira weakened against the dollar on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would give Turkey no concessions in return for the release of a detained American pastor, the latest salvo in a worsening rift between the NATO allies. 
In an interview with Reuters on Monday, Trump criticized Ankara over the detention of the evangelical Christian pastor, Andrew Brunson, and said he was not concerned that his tough stance against Turkey could end up hurting European and emerging market economies.
Brunson, who is originally from North Carolina and has lived in Turkey for two decades, has been detained for 21 months on terrorism charges, which he denies. The pastor has become an unwitting flashpoint for the diplomatic tension, which has accelerated the crisis in the lira.
Trump said that, after he helped persuade Israel to free a detained Turkish citizen, he thought Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan would then release Brunson.
""I think they're making a terrible mistake. There will be no concessions,"" Trump told Reuters. 
The lira weakened to 6.0925 against the U.S. currency by 1111 GMT, from a close of 6.0865 on Monday, when Turkish markets began a holiday to mark the Muslim Eid al-Adha festival that continues for the rest of this week. 
Trade was thinner than usual and probably mainly offshore, with local markets closed for the holiday. The currency has lost 40 percent of its value against the dollar this year. However, selling on Tuesday was limited due to a broadly weaker dollar. 
Turkish government officials did not comment on Trump's remarks when they spoke after prayers to mark the start of the festival.
Devlet Bahceli, leader of a nationalist party allied with Erdogan's AK Party, told reporters: ""We have no business with those who love Brunson more than us"".
PRAYERS AND GIFTS
Erdogan, who had been expected to speak to reporters after morning prayers, made no public statement. He has repeatedly cast the currency crisis as an attack on Turkey but has stopped short of singling out any one country.
He prayed on Tuesday morning at a mosque near the tourist resort of Marmaris on the south coast and then handed out gifts to local children, the Milliyet newspaper reported.
He also spoke by phone to soldiers stationed near the border with Iraq, sending them greetings for Eid al-Adha.
""I believe that as long as you stand tall our flag will not fall, our call to prayer will not fall silent and this homeland of ours will not be divided,"" the Hurriyet newspaper reported him as saying.
On Monday he appealed to Turks' religious and patriotic feelings ahead of the Muslim holiday, promising they would not be brought ""to their knees"" by the economic crisis.
Turkey has demanded that the United States hand over Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who lives in the United States and who Ankara says orchestrated a failed coup attempt, but Washington has balked at this.
A Turkish court last week rejected Brunson's appeal for release, drawing a stiff rebuke from Trump. The U.S. president - who counts evangelical Christians among his core supporters - has said he would double previously announced tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum imports.
On Monday Turkey initiated a dispute complaint with the World Trade Organization over the tariffs.
Separately, ratings agency Fitch said on Tuesday that tight liquidity amplified risks for Turkish companies.
Another ratings agency, DBRS, said European banks with Turkey exposure face a manageable capital impact.

Underlining the increased diplomatic tensions between Turkey and the United States, the U.S. Embassy in Ankara came under gunfire on Monday. Nobody was injured and Turkish authorities later detained two men over the incident.

The greenback has gained more than 6 percent from this year’s low in February thanks to an expanding U.S. economy and haven bids, and there may still be some upside left, Tai Hui, a global market strategist at the asset manager in Hong Kong, wrote in emailed comments.
“It may be premature to call this the end of the USD rally,” Hui said. “The greenback has been on a rapid ascent in recent months due to reduced risk appetite and outperformance in U.S. economic growth and equity performance.”
J.P. Morgan Asset joins hedge fund giant Man Group Plc in forecasting further strength in the greenback this year as escalating U.S.-China trade tensions fuel demand for the currency. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index climbed to a 13-month high last week as the trade dispute and financial turmoil in Turkey led to a selloff in emerging-market assets.
The dollar dropped for a fourth day on Tuesday as President Donald Trump was said to have complained about the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate increases while accusing Europe and China of currency manipulation.
While this week’s retreat will probably prove temporary, at some point the dollar is likely to run out of steam, Hui said.
“Speculative positioning is at its highest since 2017,” he wrote. “This doesn’t imply imminent correction but this technical factor does suggest limited room for more appreciation.”
At the same time, the U.S. economy is running a sizable current-account deficit, which needs the dollar to weaken to rebalance, he said.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. also argue the currency is nearing its peak as U.S. economic growth slows just as other major central banks begin to unwind their ultra-loose monetary policy.

534,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",UK government aims to boost exports to 35 percent of GDP,"LONDON (Reuters) - The British government will set out a new export strategy on Tuesday aimed at boosting exports to 35 percent of gross domestic product, as it looks to increase trade ties with the rest of the world after leaving the European Union.
The Department for International Trade, set up after the 2016 Brexit vote, estimates that 400,000 businesses believe they could export but don't. It said last year goods and services exported by British companies accounted for 30 percent of GDP.
""We are determined to support, connect and grow UK companies on the world stage through our international network,"" British trade minister Liam Fox will say in a speech to a business audience in London, according to extracts released in advance.
""As we leave the EU, we must set our sights high and that is just what this Export Strategy will help us achieve.""
The government said better use of Britain's overseas network, online tools and promotion of export finance support available from government would be among the measures put in place to encourage more businesses to export.
Adam Marshall, Director General of employers group the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""Our biggest competitors invest heavily in promoting their countries' products and services, and the UK must match or exceed them.""
The EU, which comprises 27 other countries, is the United Kingdom's largest single trading partner and accounted for 44 percent of exports in 2017.
Supporters of Brexit say one of its benefits will be the freedom to strike new trade deals independently of the EU. Opponents of Brexit argue Britain won't have the same negotiating clout on its own as it did within the EU.
Fox, a prominent Brexit supporter, has spent much time over the last two years touring the globe promoting the merits of post-Brexit Britain as a trading partner and holding preliminary talks ahead of possible future trade negotiations.
Previous British governments have adopted lofty targets for trade, with mixed success. 

In 2012, then-finance minister George Osborne planned to double exports to 1 trillion pounds ($1.28 trillion) by the end of the decade -- a figure that Britain looks likely to miss by a few hundred billion pounds.

535,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 05:30PM ET</span>","Trump Accuses China, EU of Currency Manipulation","(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump accused China and the European Union of manipulating their currencies as he tries to wrestle concessions from two of the U.S.’s largest trade partners.
“I think China’s manipulating their currency, absolutely. And I think the euro is being manipulated also,” Trump said in an interview with Reuters published Monday.
The president’s accusation, presented without explanation or substantiation in the Reuters report, conflicts with the findings of his own administration. The Treasury Department stopped short of naming China, the EU or any other country as a currency manipulator in April, in a semi-annual report on foreign-exchange policy. The U.S. hasn’t officially accused another country of currency manipulation since 1994.
The dollar extended its drop to trade at the day’s low as measured by the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index while the euro rose to its highest level in more than a week at $1.1481. The dollar was already under pressure after Bloomberg News reported earlier that Trump complained about interest rate hikes under Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
In the April report, Treasury dialed up its criticism of China, citing lack of progress in rectifying its trade imbalance. The department said that China met two of the three criteria that would qualify it as a currency manipulator. A designation requires the U.S. to engage in expedited negotiations with the country.
China’s stock market has suffered declines and the yuan has been on a losing streak for more than a month. Chinese authorities, bracing for economic fallout, have introduced measures to support growth ranging from shifting toward a more accommodative monetary policy to boosting fiscal spending.
“There is little evidence of more than scant Chinese foreign exchange market intervention,” Mark Sobel, a former U.S. Treasury official who worked at the department for nearly four decades, wrote in a column published Monday by a London-based think tank. He cited a lack of evidence in China’s foreign reserve holdings data and other measures."
536,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 02:52PM ET</span>","With inflation soaring, Venezuela prices shed five zeros","By Corina Pons and Tibisay Romero
CARACAS/VALENCIA, Venezuela (Reuters) - Venezuela on Monday slashed five zeros from prices as part of a broad economic plan that President Nicolas Maduro says will tame hyperinflation but critics call another raft of failed socialist policies that will push the chaotic country deeper into crisis. 
Streets were quiet and shops were closed due to a national holiday that Maduro decreed for the first day of the new pricing plan for the stricken economy, which the International Monetary Fund has estimated will have 1 million percent inflation by year end.
The price change comes with a 3,000 percent minimum wage hike, tax increases meant to shore up state coffers and a plan to peg salaries, prices and the country's exchange rate to the petro, an elusive state-backed cryptocurrency. 
Economists say the plan, which was announced last Friday, is likely to escalate the crisis facing the once-prosperous nation that is now suffering from Soviet-style product shortages and a mass exodus of citizens fleeing for other South American countries. 
Venezuelans were skeptical the plan will turn the economy around.
""I can't find a cash machine because all the banks are closed today,"" said Jose Moreno, 71, a retired engineer in the central city of Valencia, complaining of chronically dysfunctional public services.
""There's no money, there's no water, there's no electricity - there's nothing.""
After a decade-long oil bonanza that spawned a consumption boom in the OPEC member, many citizens are now reduced to scouring through garbage to find food as monthly salaries currently amount to a few U.S. dollars a month.
The new measures have worried shopkeepers already struggling to stay afloat due to hyperinflation, government-set prices for goods ranging from flour to diapers, and strict currency controls that crimp imports. 
'THE PLAN IS INCOHERENT'
Venezuela's main business organization, Fedecamaras, on Monday slammed Maduro's economic plan as ""improvised"" and said it will cause confusion and put the country's economic activity at ""severe risk.""
""Pegging the bolivar to the petro to us seems to be a serious mistake,"" said Fedecamaras President Carlos Larrazabal at a news conference. ""The plan is incoherent.""
The bolivar traded on the opaque black market on Monday at around 96 bolivars to the dollar, a rate reflecting the monetary overhaul and which implies a depreciation in real terms of nearly 30 percent since last week. The rate may not be representative of the overall market because trading volumes were thin due to the public holiday, industry experts said.
Growing discontent with Maduro has spread to the military as soldiers struggle to get enough food and many desert by leaving the country, along with thousands of civilians.
Two high-ranking military officers were arrested this month for their alleged involvement in drone explosions during a speech by Maduro, who has described it as an assassination attempt.
The chaos has become an increasing concern for the region. In recent days, Ecuador and Peru have tightened visa requirements for Venezuelans, and violence drove hundreds of Venezuelan migrants back across the border with Brazil on Saturday.
Maduro, re-elected to a second term in May in a vote widely condemned as rigged, says his government is the victim of an ""economic war"" led by political adversaries with the help of Washington, and accuses the United States of seeking to overthrow him.

The United States has denied the accusations. But it has described the former bus driver and union leader as a dictator and levied several rounds of financial sanctions against his government and top officials.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.14% to 95.86. The dollar had traded as high as 96.31 before retreating.
The euro pared losses Monday, sending the dollar lower, as investors mulled over the health of the eurozone economy as optimism over the end of Greece’s eight-year bailout on Monday was weighed against concerns about Italy's rising debt.
Italy's new populist government has promised to deliver a big spending plan, but market participants are sceptical as to how the country will be able to finance those plans. These concerns were characterized by a sharp rise in Italian bonds yields intraday, increasing the country's cost of raising money by issuing sovereign bonds.
EUR/USD rose 0.19% to $1.1460.
Sentiment on the euro remains challenged, however, as concerns of a plummeting Turkish lira persisted after Turkey's debt was downgraded deeper into junk territory on Friday.

At 11:35AM ET (15:39GMT), the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, inched up 0.02% to 96.02, after falling 0.5% on Friday, the largest one-day decline in almost a month.
The dollar’s rally stalled ahead of expected trade talks between Chinese and U.S. officials in Washington on Wednesday and Thursday. Hopes for a thawing of trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies eased demand for the safe-haven dollar.
Yet eyes in currency markets remained focused on the Turkish lira as the currency continued its decline.
The Turkish lira weakened on Monday after the country’s credit rating was cut further into junk territory on Friday and following reports of shots being fired at the U.S. embassy in Ankara.
USD/TRY was up 2.07% to 6.1421 by 11:39 AM ET (15:39 AM GMT). The lira has recovered from the record low levels of around 7.2 per dollar that it reached just over a week ago, but is still down more than 20% for the month to date.
Both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s downgraded Turkey’s sovereign credit rating on Friday amid the currency crisis in the country.

The pound has suffered six straight weeks of losses against the dollar, its worst run since 2014, even though data such as retail sales suggest the UK economy is holding up. 
With less than eight months to go until Britain leaves the EU, the government has yet to agree with Brussels the terms of its departure, and some hedge funds have started betting against the currency.
Analysts say sterling, which has shed 12 percent of its value since April, will remain vulnerable to the vagaries of Brexit negotiations in the months ahead.
""The price of the pound continues to reflect Brexit concerns and an economy that's at best muddling through,"" WorldFirst head of FX strategy Jeremy Cook said. ""The limelight is elsewhere right now and there's plenty of places people would rather be investing than sterling."" 
At 0820 GMT, the pound was down 0.1 percent against the dollar at $1.2733, near a 14-month low of $1.2662.  It was up 0.1 percent versus the euro at 89.61 pence per euro (EURGBP=D3).
The euro slipped on Monday as the dollar gained before proposed trade talks between the United States and China this week that investors hope will ease tensions between the world's two biggest economies. 
Meanwhile, business leaders' confidence in the British economy has fallen to its lowest point this year, reflecting uncertainty about Brexit, according to a survey published on Monday.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Monday as the dollar gained ahead of proposed trade talks between the United States and China this week that investors hope will ease tensions between the world's two biggest economies.
Anticipated talks between Chinese and U.S. officials in Washington will take place in the next few days, according to media reports. Analysts say those attending will be lower-level officials, although hopes are high that the talks could yield a breakthrough in the months-long trade conflict.
Escalating trade tensions between the United States and its trading partners, in addition to a plunge in the Turkish lira, have boosted the dollar and taken a heavy toll on emerging market currencies.
The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.1421 (EUR=) but was still above 2018 lows of $1.3010 hit last week. The euro slid to a 13-month low early last week amid concerns that the Turkish crisis could hurt European banks.
The dollar index rose 0.2 percent to 96.248 (DXY). Traders are also preparing for the release of Federal Reserve policy meeting minutes later this week and the Jackson Hole symposium for insights into the likely direction of U.S. monetary policy.
""Market participants will be eager to hear more details on the interpretation of the Fed's most recent comment that further gradual rate hikes were appropriate 'for now'. What does 'for now' mean and might it imply a possible change in forward guidance?"" MUFG analysts said. 
""Given our view that U.S. dollar bullishness has become a little excessive, this speech on Friday could well be a catalyst for a sharp reversal the other way as long dollar positions are pared.""
Emerging markets were mostly lower although losses were small. 
The Turkish lira  snapped a three-day rebound on Friday, sliding more than 5 percent against the dollar on fears the United States would impose more economic sanctions unless Turkey handed over detained American pastor Andrew Brunson. On Monday the lira fell 1.5 percent. 
The offshore Chinese yuan  was 0.1 percent weaker at 6.8408 per dollar after gaining about 0.4 percent on Friday, when it pulled further away from a 19-month low of 6.9585 brushed on Wednesday.
Dealers cited speculation that the Sino-U.S. trade talks could set the stage for a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in November.
The dollar rose 0.1 percent against the yen to 110.63 yen  after shedding 0.35 percent on Friday.
Kazushige Kaida, head of foreign exchange at State Street Bank in Tokyo, said dollar/yen could test the 110-level in the event of an unexpectedly negative outcome from the Sino-U.S. trade talks.
""There will be more incentive to buy the dollar if risks recede, but I don't think dollar/yen will easily break out of its range as a result of the trade negotiations,"" Kaida said.

Elsewhere the Swiss franc rose 0.2 percent to 1.1366 francs per euro (EURCHF=) while sterling slipped slightly to $1.2740  against the dollar.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's new Prime Minister Imran Khan called on Sunday for the rich to start paying taxes and said the country will begin an austerity drive to reduce debt, a campaign he will kick-start by selling his office's fleet of bullet-proof cars.
In his first address to the nation as premier, Khan set out his vision for a ""New Pakistan"" and spoke at length about the need to reshape the country by introducing an Islamic welfare system, reducing poverty and slashing high debt levels. 
""We have formed a bad habit of living on loans and aid from other countries,"" said Khan, speaking under a portrait of his hero and Pakistan founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah
""No country can prosper like this. A country must stand on its own feet."" 
Khan, 65, a former cricket legend, was sworn in as prime minister on Saturday after his party swept to power in last month's election.
A firebrand populist, Khan's appeal has soared in recent years on the back of his anti-corruption drive, which has resonated with young voters and the expanding middle class in the mainly-Muslim nation of 208 million people.
But Khan has inherited a host of problems at home and abroad, including a brewing currency crisis and fraying relations with Pakistan's historic ally, the United States.
Khan did not shed any light on policy plans to deal with the currency woes that analysts expect will force Pakistan to seek another International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout. Instead, Khan focused on debt and said former central bank governor Ishrat Husain would lead a task-force to drive austerity.
Criticizing what he called the colonial-era mindset and lavish lifestyles of Pakistan's ruling elite, Khan announced he would live in a small three-bedroom house instead of the palatial prime minister's residence.
""A SIMPLE LIFE"" 
Khan plans to have only two servants instead of 524 reserved for a sitting premier. He also announced plans to sell a fleet of bullet-proof vehicles to help Treasury shortfalls, a bold move in a country where Islamist militants still pose a threat.
""I want to tell my people, I will live a simple life, I will save your money,"" he said.
Khan appealed to overseas Pakistanis to invest in the country and urged the wealthy to start paying taxes, a perennial problem in a nation famous for tax dodging and where less than 1 percent of the population files income tax. 
""It is your responsibility to pay taxes,"" said Khan. ""Think of this as a jihad (holy war), that you need to pay tax for the betterment of your country."" 
Khan said Pakistan was in grave danger from the effects of climate change and promised to reduce some of the world's highest maternal death rates and infant mortality rates. 
He also spoke passionately about the need to help 22.8 million out-of-school Pakistani children in a nation where the literacy rate hovers above 40 percent. 
Khan, who has never held a government position, named his 21-person cabinet over the weekend, opting mostly for experienced politicians. 
Opponents criticized the choices, saying about half of the cabinet had served under the former military dictator Pervez Musharraf and were part of the old guard. On Sunday, Khan announced he will oversee the interior ministry.
A former playboy of the London social scene who has since adopted a pious persona, Khan said he wants Pakistan to build a welfare state akin to some found in the West, which he said are modeled on the ideas first voiced by Prophet Mohammad in the holy city of Medina.

""I will spend money on those who God has not given enough to,"" he said.

546,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 19, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>",Yield Curve Crunch Shows Fed Hiking Even Amid Global Agitation,"(Bloomberg) -- Global financial markets got uglier while Federal Reserve officials were on their August hiatus, but bond traders are wagering that won’t be enough to deter them from pressing on with monetary-policy tightening in the world’s largest economy.
Turkey-induced turmoil has spread across emerging markets, roiling countries from Argentina to South Africa and fueling fears of further contagion. From developing-nation stocks to copper and European banks, bear markets now abound. American short-term rates, however, remain stubbornly close to their post-crisis highs. The yield curve has also pushed back to its lows of the cycle and speculators in Treasury futures are holding record short positions.
This week’s gathering of central bankers at the Kansas City Fed’s annual Jackson Hole symposium could well provide clues as to whether such confidence is warranted, and minutes from the Fed’s Aug. 1 policy meeting also loom large. In recent years, international uncertainty has been more than enough to prompt officials to tap the brakes on tightening. Yet with inflation continuing to run above the central bank’s 2 percent target and America’s decoupling from the global downtrend continuing, this time may be different.
“Before, an overseas hiccup would cause the Fed to skip a hike,” said Michael Cloherty, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at RBC Capital Markets. “Now it would have to be real ugly turbulence across the full spectrum to cause them to delay.”
As it stands, traders are almost fully pricing in a rate hike at the Fed’s next policy meeting just over a month from now, and about 50-50 odds of a second increase by year-end, based on fed funds futures pricing. The spread between December 2018 and 2019 eurodollar contracts suggests they expect an additional one-and-a-half rate hikes next year.
Hedge funds and other large speculators are equally confident in the central bank’s tightening trajectory. They boosted wagers against 10-year Treasury futures to a record 698,194 contracts, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data for the week through Aug. 14. That’s even as ructions in emerging markets fueled the biggest weekly selloff in developing-nation shares since February.
And the spread between 2- and 10-year Treasury yields on Friday narrowed to the least since August 2007 as investors continue to crush any signs of steepening.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will headline this year’s Jackson Hole gathering of prominent central bankers and economists with a speech about monetary policy in a changing economy on Aug. 24.
Talking Taper
Yet given the conference has historically offered only modest insight into the trajectory for monetary policy, Cloherty says he expects this week’s release of minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s Aug. 1 meeting to be more consequential for the bond market, especially if the topic of balance-sheet normalization was discussed.
Powell noted at his semi-annual testimony to Congress last month that the Fed would take up the question about the size of its balance sheet “fairly soon.” Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short-term interest rates at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), said more direction from the central bank “needs to be forthcoming.”
It would be a nice time for the Fed to revisit the topic “and provide some guidance to the market on how they’re thinking about the process,” he said.
Balance-sheet deliberations are becoming increasingly important as Wall Street pulls forward forecasts for when the central bank will conclude its unwind.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG analyst Zoltan Pozsar said last week that the Fed may be forced to halt the tapering process before year-end due to America’s widening fiscal deficit, as surging Treasury-bill issuance puts upward pressure on the effective fed funds rate just a policy makers work to keep it steady.
“These concerns are likely accelerating the focus on this internally,” Cabana said. “They need to guide the market a little more about how they’re thinking.”

Geopolitical risks will also remain in focus this week, with the U.S. expected to impose fresh sanctions on Russia on Wednesday. On Thursday, Washington is expected to slap 25% tariffs on an additional $16 billion of Chinese imports, to which Beijing has threatened to retaliate in kind.
The dollar fell against a basket of the other major currencies on Friday, pulling back from a 13-month high hit earlier in the week as worries over trade tensions between the U.S. and China eased, dampening safe haven demand.

Market sentiment was boosted by news that Beijing is set to resume trade talks with Washington this week, although at a lower level than previously. It will be the first round of trade talks since June and could be a step towards easing trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies.

548,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 05:55PM ET</span>","Turkey's lira falls 3 percent, Trump won't take pastor's detention 'sitting down'","By Daren Butler, David Dolan and Humeyra Pamuk
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's battered lira weakened 3 percent on Friday after a Turkish court rejected an American pastor's appeal for release, drawing a stiff rebuke from President Donald Trump, who said the United States would not take the detention ""sitting down"".
The case of Andrew Brunson, an evangelical Christian missionary from North Carolina who has lived in Turkey for two decades, has become a flashpoint between Washington and Ankara and accelerated a widening currency crisis.
The lira  has lost nearly 40 percent of its value against the dollar this year as investors fret about President Tayyip Erdogan's influence over monetary policy. 
Heavy selling in recent weeks has spread to other emerging market currencies and global stocks and deepened concerns about the economy, particularly Turkey's dependence on energy imports and whether foreign-currency debt poses a risk to banks.
Borrowing costs may rise further after both Moody's and Standard & Poor's ratings agencies cut Turkey's sovereign credit ratings deeper into ""junk"" territory late on Friday.
""They should have given him back a long time ago, and Turkey has in my opinion acted very, very badly,"" Trump told reporters at the White House, referring to Brunson. ""So, we haven't seen the last of that. We are not going to take it sitting down. They can't take our people.""
Trump's comments came after a court in Izmir province rejected an appeal to release Brunson from house arrest, saying evidence was still being collected and the pastor posed a flight risk, according to a copy of the court ruling seen by Reuters. 
Brunson is being held on terrorism charges, which he denies. Trump, who counts evangelical Christians among his core supporters, has increasingly championed the pastor's case.
It was not immediately clear what additional measures, if any, Trump could be considering. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Trump on Thursday that more sanctions were ready if Brunson were not freed.
The United States and Turkey have imposed tit-for-tat tariffs in an escalating attempt by Trump to induce Erdogan into giving up the pastor. Erdogan has cast the tariffs, and the lira's sell-off, as an ""economic war"" against Turkey.
The lira last traded at 6.0100 to the dollar at 2159 GMT, 3 percent weaker after tumbling as much as 7 percent earlier. Turkey's dollar bonds fell, while the cost of insuring exposure to Turkish debt rose.
As the row deepens, Turkey has sought to improve strained ties with European allies. In a telephone call on Friday, Finance Minister Berat Albayrak and his French counterpart Bruno Le Maire discussed U.S. sanctions against Turkey and cooperation between their countries, Albayrak's ministry said.
SPEED-BUMPS
""Diplomatic negotiations hit speed-bumps and that's not unusual in these kinds of situations,"" said Jay Sekulow, a personal attorney for Trump who is also representing Brunson's family. ""We remain hopeful there will be a prompt resolution. Having said that, we fully support the president's approach.""
Whatever action the United States takes looks likely to cause more pain for Turkish assets.
""There has been no improvement in relations with the U.S. and additional sanctions may be on the horizon,"" said William Jackson of Capital Economics in a note to clients, adding that the lira could see a downward trend in 2019 and beyond.
Turkey's banking watchdog has taken steps to stabilize the currency, limiting futures transactions for offshore investors and lowering limits on swap transactions. On Friday, it further broadened those caps.
But some economists have called for more decisive moves.
Turkey and its firms face repayments of nearly $3.8 billion on foreign currency bonds in October,  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) has calculated. It estimates Turkey's short-term external debt at $180 billion and total external debt at $460 billion - the highest in emerging markets.
Companies that for years have borrowed abroad at low interest rates have seen their cost of servicing foreign debt rise by a quarter in lira terms in two months.
After each downgrading Turkey by one notch, S&P said it expected a recession next year while Moody's said a weakening of Turkey's public institutions had made policymaking less predictable.
Fitch Ratings had earlier said the absence of an orthodox monetary policy response to the lira's fall, and the rhetoric of Turkish authorities, had ""increased the difficulty of restoring economic stability and sustainability"".
DEEP CONCERNS
Albayrak, Erdogan's son-in-law, told investors on Thursday that Turkey would emerge stronger from the currency crisis, insisting its banks were healthy and signaling it could ride out the dispute with Washington.
Economists gave Albayrak's presentation a qualified welcome and the lira initially found some support, helped by Qatar's pledge to invest $15 billion in Turkey.
Deep concerns remain about the potential for damage to the economy, however. Turkey is dependent on imports, priced in hard currency, for almost all of its energy needs.
Erdogan has remained defiant, urging Turks to sell their gold and dollars for lira. But foreign currency deposits held by local investors rose to $159.9 billion in the week to Aug. 10, from $158.6 billion a week earlier, central bank data showed. 

Turkish markets will be closed from midday on Monday for the rest of the week for the Muslim Eid al-Adha festival.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.31% to 96.158.
The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index in August fell to 95.3, down from 97.9 in July. That was the lowest level in 11 months and did little to encourage traders to back the dollar.
The greenback was also pressured by uptick in safe-haven yen, as fears of contagion resumed after the lira turned bearish, falling about 5%.
USD/JPY fell 0.45% to Y110.41.
Fresh selling emerged in the USD/TRY as market participants were not impressed by Turkey's central bank efforts to limit foreign investors from betting against its embattled domestic currency. Turkey took measures to limit the amount of currency-swap transactions, a movethat analysts said would curb foreign investment flows into the country as it limits investors' ability to offset the risk of plummeting lira.
""By taking this step, the government is cutting off the branch the Turkish economy is currently sitting on,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analysts said in a note. ""It removes the ability of foreigners to hedge against Turkish lira weakness. Who is going to buy Turkish stocks, bonds, etc., if there is no opportunity to hedge the currency risk?""
Yet bargain hunters appeared to shrug off fresh selling in the lira and scooped up a cheaper euro as it rose 0.28% against the dollar to $1.1410. The single currency was set to post its first weekly gain in four weeks.

550,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>","Turkey Targets Credit as Sanctions, Rating Spark Lira Jitters","(Bloomberg) -- Turkish banks moved to ease access to credit for companies as the prospect of further U.S. sanctions and a review of the nation’s debt sent new convulsions through financial markets.
In the latest steps to shield the economy from the recent rout of the lira, the Treasury and Finance Ministry said lenders would ensure credit lines to non-financial companies remained open and pricing and repayment periods kept flexible. The statement came hours before S&P Global Ratings was scheduled to announce its rating and outlook on Turkey’s foreign-currency debt, three months after it cut the nation deeper into junk territory.
The uncertainty added to negative investor sentiment already building after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin again urged President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government on Thursday to free American pastor Andrew Brunson, whose plight plunged already strained bilateral ties into a crisis, or face more sanctions.
An appeals court in the coastal city of Izmir is set to rule by Saturday on a bid by Brunson’s lawyer to release him.
While reassuring pledges by Treasury and Economy Minister Berat Albayrak on a global investor conference call Thursday and a crackdown on betting against the currency have helped the lira rebound by around 6 percent against the dollar this week -- after losing a fifth of its value the previous week -- the prospect of renewed conflict with the U.S. again has markets on edge.
“It still looks like we’re headed to more conflict,” Kathy Jones, chief fixed-income strategist at Charles Schwab. “Neither side seems to be backing down yet.”
On Friday the lira slid as much as 8 percent before paring losses to 3.9 percent to trade at 6.0676 per dollar at 1:39 p.m. in Istanbul, bringing its decline for the year to around 37 percent.
Market turmoil was triggered when the U.S. first sanctioned two ministers in Erdogan’s government over the continued detention of Brunson for what Turkey says was his role in a failed 2016 coup. For much of this week, the currency pared losses on the back of a stealth interest rate hike by the central bank and a limit by banking regulators on swaps that cut down on short selling the lira.
Erdogan, who has rejected concerns that Turkey might need a rescue package from the International Monetary Fund, also expanded his diplomatic outreach this week, speaking to leaders of Germany and France and striking a deal with Qatari emir which will see an inflow of $15 billion into the economy.
On Friday, government officials announced a slew of measures to protect the creditworthiness of companies hurt by the weaker lira or their failure to repay debt amid the market turmoil. The Treasury and Finance Ministry, which originally announced the measures, said they were formulated by Turkey’s banking association TBB and were only recommendations for lenders.
With Turkish companies weighed down by increasingly costly foreign-currency debt --estimated at 40 percent of gross domestic product -- and confronting double-digit inflation, the S&P review provides the latest flash point.
“The market turmoil in Turkey is the latest in a series of fragilities amplified by gradually tightening financial conditions this year,” according to Wei Li, BlackRock’s head of iShares EMEA strategy in London. “Investors should prepare for further bouts of volatility ahead.”

553,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 05:00AM ET</span>",China Seen Strengthening Yuan as Trade Talks With U.S. Loom,"(Bloomberg) -- China appears to be propping up the yuan just as it prepares to restart trade negotiations with the U.S.
After falling to a one-year low, the offshore yuan -- one of the world’s weakest currencies in recent months -- on Thursday surged the most since January 2017 as cash supply dwindled and the central bank set its daily fixings at stronger than expected levels. That came as the Ministry of Commerce said it would send a delegation to the U.S. later this month, stoking hopes of a revival of talks that stalled in June.
“China and the U.S. are finally sharing common interests on the yuan: while Washington always wants a stronger currency, Beijing may think the exchange rate has fallen enough and needs to stabilize,” said Zhou Hao, a senior economist at Commerzbank AG in Singapore. “We will see intense defense if the yuan moves closer to seven per dollar.”
The New York Times, citing an unidentified person briefed on the plans, said Friday the U.S. Treasury Department will seek to pressure China to strengthen the yuan at the trade talks this month.
President Donald Trump has accused China of keeping its currency artificially weak to garner a trade advantage, saying on television channel CNBC last month that the yuan is “dropping like a rock,” to America’s detriment. The yuan has fallen more than 8 percent versus the dollar since March as the People’s Bank of China eased monetary policy to support a slowing economy while trade friction with the U.S. worsened. But Chinese policy makers worry a disorderly drop could trigger capital outflows and threaten financial stability.
“China wouldn’t want the yuan to slide too quickly before important meetings, and that could be one of the reasons why the policy makers moved to support the currency,” said Nathan Chow, senior economist at DBS Bank Hong Kong Ltd. “The yuan will still face pressures as there are many uncertainties with the low-level trade talks. I don’t think China will bend to the U.S. that easily.”
Here’s a list of news that has been supporting the yuan lately:
The offshore yuan was little changed at 6.8626 per dollar as of 4:44 p.m. in Hong Kong after swinging between a loss of 0.21 percent and a gain of 0.30 percent. The onshore rate rose 0.17 percent. One-year interbank borrowing costs of the yuan in Hong Kong -- known as Hibor -- surged 55 basis points, the most since December 2016, to 4.26 percent, reflecting tighter liquidity.
Measures to tighten cash supply are nowhere near as aggressive as in the aftermath of a shock yuan devaluation three years ago, said Sue Trinh, head of Asia foreign-exchange strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong. The offshore yuan’s overnight Hibor surged to a record 66.8 percent in early 2016. It was at 2 percent on Friday."

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro rose for a second day in a row on Friday as hopes that next week's talks between the United States and China will ease trade tensions between the two pushed the dollar lower.
The Turkish lira's continued recovery helped some emerging market currencies, although the Chinese yuan slipped slightly after Thursday's big rise, underlining investor nervousness about volatility in developing markets.
The euro has been under pressure in recent weeks on worries about euro zone bank exposure to Turkey after the lira crashed this month. Concerns that Italy's governing parties will agree a budget with high public spending have also weighed on the single currency.
The dollar has benefited as investors rush towards safety.
Alvin Tan, FX strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), said Friday's moves were more to do with dollar weakness as investors show greater appetite for taking on risk than euro strength. 
""Volatility seems to have fizzled out in the last 24 hours and the stability in the remninbi has helped emerging market currencies,"" he said.
The euro ticked 0.1 percent higher to $1.1385 (EUR=) while the dollar index - a measure of the dollar against a basket of major currencies - fell 0.1 percent to 96.513 (DXY).
Still, analysts saw limits to any euro rebound.
""Considering that European banks' exposure to Turkey is relatively limited, this week's reaction by the euro looked overdone. But the rise in Italian bond yields amid the country's fiscal concerns may continue indefinitely and limit the bounce by the euro,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities.
The Japanese yen , up 0.1 percent to 110.74, and sterling  also capitalized on the greenback's weakness to move higher.
China and the United States agreed on Thursday to hold a new round of trade talks on Aug. 21-22, supporting the yuan. 
The Chinese currency's slide in recent months, partly on the back of concerns about what a full-blown trade war with the U.S. would do to China's economy, has rattled investors.
After a recovery on Thursday, the yuan in offshore markets slipped 0.2 percent to 6.8727 , still far below its 2018 lows of 6.9587.
The Turkish lira rose half a percent to 5.7933 per dollar  as sentiment improved. The closure of Turkish financial markets for a string of national holidays during Aug. 21-24 also provided some respite.
The lira plunged to a record low of 7.24 on Monday before mounting a three-day rebound, helped by factors including measures by the Turkish central bank to support its currency and Qatar's pledge to invest $15 billion in Turkey.
However, there are still concerns over Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's policies to combat the country's double-digit inflation and his row with Washington over detained American pastor Andrew Brunson.

The Australian dollar rose 0.1 percent to $0.7265 , gaining for a second day, although momentum was lost after Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Philip Lowe said interest rates would stay at record lows ""for a while yet"".

The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, slipped 0.1% to 96.47 by 1:30AM ET (05:30 GMT). The index climbed to 96.984, its highest since June 2017 on Wednesday when concerns over China’s economic health and Turkish’s lira crisis drove investors to the greenback and other safe-haven assets.
Meanwhile, a rebound by onshore Chinese yuan faded after the latest trade news helped the currency to pull back from a 19-month trough of 6.9340 against the dollar set mid-week. The USD/CNY pair last stood at 6.8884, up 0.7%.
News that Chinese and U.S. officials will begin trade talks later this month improved market sentiment, even as Larry Kudlow, Trump’s top economic aide, warned China that the U.S. is determined to get a good deal.
""With the much stronger than expected daily fixing in the past few days and improving sentiment on the U.S.-China trade talk, the market will be more cautious in chasing USD/CNY higher in the near term,"" strategists at OCBC Bank wrote.
The USD/TRY pair gained 0.06% 5.8663. The lira is now up almost 25% from its record low of 7.2400 hit early on Monday on reports that Qatar has promised to invest $15 billion in Turkey.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.01% to 96.58.
White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow confirmed Thursday that the U.S. and China will resume trade talks later this month, ending a two-month stalemate during which both countries have imposed billions of dollars' worth of tariffs on each other's goods.
Concerns over Turkey eased as lira continued its recovery from a slump earlier in the week, underpinning risk sentiment, after Turkish financial minister Berat Albayrak reportedly told investors that the government would tighten fiscal policy and ruled out capital controls.
But analysts said the ""half-measures"" implemented by Turkey this week were unlikely to pull its economy from the brink and called for the country to adopt a policy overhaul.
""These exemplify the half-measures that are unlikely to restore confidence,"" Berenberg Bank said. ""Considering the country shows the 'classic signs' of economic overheating, Turkey needs to rise interest rates and implement fiscal prudence, including less reliance on credit-financed vanity projects such as the next mega-airport or a channel to bypass the Bosporus.""
The dollar was also knocked by mixed U.S. economic data on housing and regional manufacturing.
The Commerce Department said Tuesday U.S. homebuilding fell 0.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.168 million units in July, well below economists’ estimates for a 7.4% rise.
In a separate report, the Philadelphia Fed said its manufacturing index fell 13.8 points to a reading of 11.9, from 25.7 in July.
The euro gave up most of its gains despite an earlier surge on the back of a rising in the lira.
EUR/USD rose 0.17% to $1.1366 after languishing at 13-1/2 month lows.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Istanbul's beloved fish sandwiches, a staple street food in the Bosphorus city, are being offered for free to Turks who heed President Tayyip Erdogan's call to sell their dollars for lira.
The offer is just one of many by vendors across Turkey who are backing Erdogan's appeal to nationalist sentiment, giving out anything from orchids, petrol or a three-day hotel stay for those who show dollar exchange receipts.
If customers can show a slip proving they exchanged $100 dollars into Turkish lira, Adnan Celiker, an Istanbul restaurateur, will hand over his fish sandwiches, or ""balik ekmek"", for nothing.
""The aim here is to make our voice heard and show our reaction,"" said Celiker, who runs a waterfront store on the Anatolian side of Istanbul where diners can enjoy their meal sitting on a nearby boat.
Celiker's restaurant's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page touts the offer with a picture showing a raised fist emblazoned with the Turkish flag above a cowering $100 bill.
Erdogan has called on people to support the weakened lira by exchanging gold and foreign currency, citing an ""economic war"" being waged against Turkey.
The lira hit a record low of 7.24 to the dollar this week after losing nearly half its value this year, as investors fretted over Erdogan's influence over monetary policy and a dispute with the United States. 
It has since pulled back a little to under 6 lira to the dollar.
Despite the lira campaign, foreign currency deposits held by local investors in Turkey rose by $1.3 billion to $159.9 billion last week, central bank data showed on Thursday.
Turkish media have given extensive coverage to anti-U.S. protests, including videos on social media showing Turks apparently burning dollar bills and destroying iPhones.
A barbershop in eastern Turkey announced it will stop offering ""American style"" haircuts. The hashtag ""Boycott USA"" was the number one trending topic on Thursday morning and, later, ""Turkey Will Prevail.""

558,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Yuan Bears Squeezed as Cost to Short Surges Most Since 2011,"(Bloomberg) -- Betting against the yuan just got a whole lot more expensive.
The cost of bearish wagers on the Chinese currency, as reflected in the offshore yuan’s 12-month forward points, soared the most since 2011 on Thursday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The move came amid speculation that China was restricting banks’ ability to lend yuan offshore.
The yuan jumped 1.25 percent to 6.8615 a dollar in offshore trading at 11:34 a.m. in New York, adding to earlier gains that were fueled by a stronger-than-expected daily fixing from the central bank. News that Chinese and U.S. officials will engage in low-level trade talks later this month also contributed to positive market sentiment, even as Larry Kudlow, Trump’s top economic aide, signaled the U.S. would stand firm and said Trump’s determination on trade should not be ""underestimated.""
“Many offshore investors unwound their short yuan positions today,” said Zhou Hao, senior emerging markets economist at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) in Singapore.
Chinese authorities have been trying to limit bets against the yuan after the currency depreciated more than 9 percent since March, approaching the closely watched level of 7 per dollar. While a weaker exchange rate has helped Chinese exporters weather the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs, policy makers worry that a disorderly drop could trigger capital outflows and threaten China’s financial stability.
As the yuan’s slump has accelerated in recent weeks, the People’s Bank of China has taken several steps to slow its drop. Two weeks ago, the central bank made it costlier to place short bets against the currency with forwards. And last week, the monetary authority urged big banks to avoid bearish momentum trades.
On Thursday, Reuters reported that the PBOC banned commercial banks from using interbank accounts to deposit or lend yuan offshore through the nation’s free-trade zone channels. The PBOC didn’t immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.
Downward pressure on the yuan has been growing on multiple fronts. Not only has the U.S. trade war hurt market sentiment, but weaker-than-estimated figures on Chinese fixed-asset investment and credit creation this week have fueled concern that the $12 trillion economy is already slowing. The PBOC has kept borrowing costs low even as the Federal Reserve tightens, raising the specter of capital outflows as the yield advantage for Chinese fixed-income securities shrinks.
When similar pressures were building in 2015 and 2016, Chinese authorities squeezed yuan bears by lifting offshore funding costs dramatically. They also spent billions in foreign-exchange reserves to buy the currency and clamped down on capital outflows.
While the government’s response this time around has been much less extreme, policy makers have sent a clear message that they want to avoid disorderly swings in the exchange rate, according to Carie Li, an economist at OCBC Wing Hang Bank in Hong Kong.
“PBOC’s bottom line is to prevent one-way yuan depreciation,” Li said. “Investors probably have unwound short-yuan positions amid fear of further intervention.”

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian rouble regained ground on Thursday after another sell-off, but lingering concern about U.S. sanctions sent government bonds to their lowest since late 2016.
The rouble has lost 7 percent of its value so far this month, amid threats of more U.S. sanctions against Russia, which could target government bonds, and a sharp downturn in other emerging markets.
The rouble gained 0.2 percent to 67.17 versus the dollar at 1105 GMT, compared with 68.66 on Monday, its weakest level since April 2016. It remained weaker than the levels around 62 it reached in late July.
The rouble pared earlier losses on the eve of the 20th anniversary of Russia's state default, an event so notorious Wikipedia has a page called ""August Curse"".
While Russia, with international reserves of nearly $460 billion, is nowhere close to default on state bonds at the moment, investors ditched rouble-denominated treasury bonds known as OFZs.
Yields on 10-year OFZ bonds (RU10YT=RR), which move inversely with bond prices, rose to 8.50 percent, their highest since December 2016.
""Visible is selling (of OFZ bonds) by non-residents, including real money funds. This is related to worsening of the external political background,"" said Konstantin Kostrub, head of treasury at ING Eurasia bank in Moscow.
Foreign investors have been cutting their share of OFZ bonds this year amid threats that the U.S. sanctions would restrict holdings of Russian debt.
Russian authorities are not expected to step in to defend the rouble or OFZ bonds, but the central bank took some pressure off the market by putting its daily purchases of foreign currency on hold earlier this month.
Against the euro, the rouble was 0.1 percent stronger at 76.29, moving away from the 78.15 mark it touched this week.
Prices for oil, Russia's key export, have also stabilized after falling earlier in August. Brent crude (LCOc1), a global benchmark, was up 0.24 percent at $70.93 a barrel, down from this month's peak of $74.87.
Russian stock indexes were mixed. The dollar-denominated RTS index (IRTS) was up 0.74 percent to 1,063,10 points; the rouble-based MOEX (IMOEX) was 0.07 percent lower at 2,265.45 points.

Many emerging market currencies also rose, clawing back some of Wednesday's losses thanks to easing fears over the knock-on effects from a slide in the Turkish lira. 
Global equity markets were mixed, however, underlining how nervous investors remain.
""That China and the U.S. are beginning to talk again is supporting the market,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currencies strategist Thu Lan Nguyen. ""As the (Turkish) lira did not depreciate further, that has taken out some tension from the market.""
She also emphasized that the currency crisis in Turkey is far from over because authorities have yet to tackle the root causes.
More important for major currencies on Thursday were developments in the months-long trade conflict between the United States and China. 
China's Ministry of Commerce said it had received an invitation from the United States for talks to be held with U.S. Under Secretary of Treasury for International Affairs David Malpass. 
The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.1367 (EUR=), away from Wednesday's low of $1.1301.
The dollar, which has gained on bouts of investor jitters as traders seek safety in the higher-yielding and most liquid currency, fell after a recent strong run. The dollar index slipped 0.1 percent to 96.613 (DXY).
China's yuan, which has fallen in recent months on concerns about the impact on its economy of the trade conflict with the United States, gained 0.7 percent in offshore markets to 6.9005 .
APPARENT CALM
Emerging market currencies bounced across the board, including the South African rand , the Mexican peso  and Russian rouble (RUB=).
Turkey's lira rallied about 3 percent to 5.7923  before a presentation by Finance Minister Berat Albayrak to investors, but is still down 34 percent against the dollar this year.
Despite Thursday's calm, analysts remain cautious about the outlook for markets, particularly those outside of the United States that have looked vulnerable whenever investors get nervous.
Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon, said ""a seeming disconnect between U.S. markets and those elsewhere is becoming increasingly obvious"", given the performance of U.S. equities and the dollar in 2018. 
""The risk is that the apparent calm in U.S. markets may be giving U.S. investors a false read about how volatile the next few months might prove for global markets,"" Derrick said. 
The yen paused after its recent run, with the dollar gaining 0.1 percent to 110.84 yen .
Norway's crown (EURNOK=) fell slightly against the euro after the Norwegian central bank kept interest rates on hold and reiterated it planned to hike in September. It was largely unmoved against the dollar, up 0.6 percent on the day . 

The Australian dollar, seen as a proxy for China-related trades, climbed 0.4 percent to $0.7265  after falling to $0.7202 on Wednesday, its weakest since January 2017.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for a weaker U.S. dollar in a bid to help U.S. exporters, but his recent trade policies, including the imposition of import tariffs on some Turkish goods, have had the opposite effect of strengthening the greenback. 
The dollar this week rose to a 13-month high against a basket of currencies, getting an extra boost as emerging markets have sold off on concern about contagion from Turkey and investors sought a safehaven in the U.S. currency.
On August 10, Trump intensified the spat with Turkey over the detention in Turkey of U.S. evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson on terrorism charges by imposing higher tariffs on metal imports. The move sent the Turkish lira to a record low against the dollar and spurred declines in other emerging market currencies.

The U.S. dollar has risen against major currencies for several months, with the dollar index (DXY) up nearly 8 percent over the last four months. On Wednesday, the index hit a fresh 13-month high.
""In a lot of ways some of his actions have amplified this risk-off type of environment, which has ultimately helped the U.S. dollar strengthen in the near-term,"" said Charles Tomes, senior investment analyst and trader at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.
GRAPHIC: President Trump on U.S. dollar - https://reut.rs/2P971NE
Robust U.S. economic data this year, even as Europe and other major economies have lost some steam, has helped keep the U.S. Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates twice more this year, which should boost the appeal of the dollar further.
“I think the dollar is strengthening as a result of diverging monetary policies,"" said Oliver Pursche, Chief Market Strategist Of Bruderman Brothers In New York. ""It's fairly clear that the Fed is almost certain to hike in September and very likely to hike in December again, whereas other central banks are maintaining a status quo.""
Some analysts said that U.S. tax cuts passed last year by Congress which are boosting corporate earnings and economic growth have reinforced the reasons for raising interest rates. The $1.5 trillion tax cut and the $1.3 trillion spending bill enacted in March, have pushed forecasts for the fiscal deficit higher. The U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly four years in the second quarter.
""So now you have economic data warranting the Fed rate hiking cycle and expectations for other central banks pushed out a little bit,"" said Tomes.
The administration's move to impose import tariffs against China, Europe, Mexico and Canada is also expected to contribute to inflation, which tends to ramp up bets on a swifter pace of Fed rate hikes and, in turn, a stronger dollar.
Investors have also shown a preference for the greenback based on the expectation that the it will gain at the expense of emerging market currencies which are dependent on commodity exports.

The currency climbed as much as 3.9 percent to an almost one-week high of 5.6968 against the dollar, extending a rebound from a record low touched on Monday amid a diplomatic feud with the U.S. The call with Albayrak is due to begin at 4 p.m. local time, according to two people familiar with the matter who declined to be identified.
Authorities have already stepped in with a series of liquidity measures and eased rules on restructuring troubled loans, while President Recep Tayyip Erdogan secured a financial lifeline from Qatar. Still, many say higher interest rates are needed to anchor the currency as inflation shows no signs of easing and as the economy deals with the shock of the market rout.
“The lira is likely to remain extremely volatile in the coming days and weeks,” said William Jackson, the chief emerging-market economist at Capital Economics in London. “Inflation will be higher and the slump in the economy deeper than we had previously expected.”

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, hit an overnight low of 96.28 and was down 0.14% to 96.45 by 04:22 AM ET (08:22 AM GMT). The index hit a high of 96.76 on Wednesday, the most since June 27, 2017.
Demand for the greenback continued to be underpinned by concerns over the rout in the Turkish lira, which plunged to record lows at the start of the week.
Deteriorating relations between the U.S. and Ankara and worries about Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's increasing control over monetary policy and the economy have seen the lira tumble more than 40% this year.
The lira has recovered somewhat since its selloff earlier in the week and was higher for a third day on Thursday after news that Qatar offered Turkey $15 billion of investment.
Geopolitical risks remained to the fore however, with heightened tensions between U.S. and Ankara likely to nudge Turkey closer to countries like Russia, China and Iran.
Markets were encouraged by reports that the U.S and China are to hold another round of trade talks later this month, amid an ongoing trade spat between the world’s two largest economies.
The safe haven yen was little changed against the dollar, with USD/JPY at 110.78.
The euro pulled away from Wednesday’s 14-month lows, with EUR/USD advancing 0.28% to 1.1378.
The single currency has been pressured lower by fears over the exposure of European banks to Turkey.

564,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 12:30AM ET</span>","Yuan Climbs on U.S. Trade Talk Hopes, Tencent Pulls Stocks Lower","(Bloomberg) -- The yuan strengthened and Chinese stocks pared some of their earlier losses after China said it would dispatch a delegation to the U.S. later this month, raising hopes that trade negotiations can resume after a two-month hiatus.
China’s currency jumped 0.50 percent to 6.9012 per dollar as of 11:54 a.m. local time, after sliding to its lowest since January 2017 late Wednesday. The offshore yuan, which neared its weakest on record overnight, rose for the first time in seven days, surging 0.72 percent as forward points spiked. In addition to the trade talks boosting the yuan, the People’s Bank of China set its daily reference rate stronger than expected.
Equities in Hong Kong and mainland China were more volatile, as the trade news was offset by a 5 percent slump in Tencent Holdings Ltd. after the Chinese technology company reported its first drop in profit in at least a decade. The Hang Seng Index fell 1.7 percent before bouncing back with a 0.3 percent gain. It then slid again and was last down 0.6 percent. The CSI 300 Index was down 0.6 percent as of the mid-day trading break on the mainland, after swinging from a loss of 1.8 percent to a gain of 0.7 percent.
“Some funds might be buying the dips after stocks dropped below key levels earlier, though I doubt any rebound amid a downturn would be strong enough to sustain,” said Linus Yip, a Hong Kong-based strategist at First Shanghai Securities Ltd. “Investors will likely remain cautious despite the latest sign that China and the U.S. will return to the negotiation table. There have been some twists and turns before and people expect more down the road on the trade issue.”
The yuan was the strongest currency in Asia on Thursday. Over the past three months, though, it has weakened about 8 percent against the dollar as the PBOC eased monetary policy to support a slowing economy and trade friction with the U.S. worsened. Policy makers have made it more expensive to short the yuan and urged banks to avoid “herd behavior” in the currency market.
“Relief on China-U.S. trade tensions cooled down expectations for further declines in the yuan toward 7 per dollar, and prompted some investors to trim their short yuan positions,” said Ken Cheung, a senior currency strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. “We maintain our view that policy makers will not let the yuan break 7 this year. The central bank will step up actions to stabilize sentiment if necessary.”
In Hong Kong, meanwhile, the city’s monetary authority again stepped in to buy up the local currency to defend its peg to the greenback. The de facto central bank bought HK$14.6 billion ($1.9 billion) of local dollars Wednesday, taking its spending on intervention this week to HK$16.8 billion. Prior to this weeks moves, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority hadn’t stepped in since May. The currency traded at 7.8495 per dollar.

Meanwhile, the USD/TRY pair was trading 0.3% lower as Qatar promised to invest $15 billion in Turkey. The lira surged as much as 8% against the dollar in the previous session following the news.

566,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 10:30PM ET</span>",Australian Dollar Suffers Collateral Damage in Trade War,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors have brushed aside Australia’s world-beating economic growth to make its currency the whipping boy of the trade war.
Down 9 percent in the past six months, the Aussie dollar’s correlation with the tumbling offshore yuan reached the strongest on record in August as investors entwine the two nations’ fortunes. It’s a clear sign of Australia’s vulnerability to a slowdown in China that’s being exacerbated by U.S. tariffs. And if that wasn’t enough, the Aussie’s set to remain under pressure as the crisis engulfing Turkey drives a flight to safety and the U.S. dollar.
“We’re No. 1 on the list of collateral damage in who really has a lot to lose if the China story goes south,” said Sally Auld, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s head of fixed-income and currency strategy for Australia. “We’re a small, open economy that’s highly leveraged to trade and to China so anything that creates difficulty with global trade is bad for us by definition. It’s pretty fundamental to our economic well-being.”
Australia’s currency is under fire as the economy caps a 27th recession-free year amid accelerating growth, robust exports and the government eyeing its first budget surplus in a decade. Fear has become the main driver: China buys more than a third of Australia’s exports, equivalent to about 8 percent of gross domestic product. That, combined with Australia’s liquid foreign exchange market, makes the currency an ideal target.
How bad could it get?
Rodrigo Catril, a currency strategist at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Sydney, says it’s “not unreasonable” to see a level below 69 U.S. cents if there’s a spike in volatility and commodity prices drop. Nick Twidale, chief operating officer at Rakuten Securities Australia Pty., a unit of the major Japanese trading house, reckons the Aussie will trade below 70 U.S. cents by year’s end, and potentially as low as 60 cents in the longer-term.
The currency bought around 72 cents in Sydney on Wednesday.
“The Aussie has been regarded as the major currency risk proxy for the APAC region and specifically China for a while now, and for good reason,” said Twidale. “As global trade tensions persist and indeed increase, and more specifically tensions between China and the U.S., then investors will continue to look to sell the Aussie dollar.”
Tipping Point
A weaker currency is welcomed in some quarters. The Reserve Bank of Australia has kept interest rates at a record-low 1.5 percent for two years, with some economists seeing it staying there for another two. A leg down in the Aussie opens up the possibility of faster growth and inflation that could spur policy makers into action -- but the context will be important.
If the currency should sink into the 60s against a backdrop of a trade war that’s hurting global growth, it’s unikely to encourage Governor Philip Lowe and his board to consider tightening policy. But should such a move happen in a strong global environment and healthy domestic backdrop, that could change the equation.
While there have been murmurings about China and the U.S. restarting trade talks, the tariff deadlines are looming: another round is set for next week and a third is potentially coming in September. The rhetoric remains severe: the Trump administration has portrayed President Xi Jinping’s government as a protectionist regime that needs to be reined in; while China has warned the U.S. that it’s willing to “fight to the end.”
“The Australian dollar is a risk-sensitive currency,” said NAB’s Catril. It “remains vulnerable to the increasing probability that we will see an escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions.”
Australia and its currency have often been seen as a barometer for the global economy. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said he often looked Down Under for an indicator on the U.S. economy. Yet in recent times the Australian story has decoupled from the global picture, lately characterized by tighter monetary policy as nations approach full employment that’s still to be achieved in Australia.
Even as the world lumps Australia with China, direct hits from a trade war aren’t being felt in Sydney. China dominates Australian shipments of iron ore to produce steel for infrastructure and housing, and it also fuels growth in its education exports, but these industries are of almost no relevance to the U.S.-China dispute.
“It’s hard to argue that we’re in the direct firing line if you look at what the U.S. is proposing or has put tariffs on,” said JPMorgan’s Auld. “We’re just being caught up in the dollar strength at the moment. There’s no reason why we should get pounded just because the Turkish lira is belted.”

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority bought HK$14.6 billion of local dollars Wednesday, according to the de facto central bank’s page on Bloomberg, after the currency declined to the weak end of its trading band. The aggregate balance will fall to HK$92.6 billion, the first time since 2008 that the measure of interbank liquidity will dip below HK$100 billion.
After the HKMA started intervening again this week for the first time since May, analysts are watching to see when efforts to defend Hong Kong’s dollar will start driving up borrowing costs in the city. One-year Hong Kong interbank rates climbed by 1 basis point Wednesday.
“Hong Kong still has ample liquidity,” .said Kim Man Ngan, co-head of treasury at China Everbright Bank Co.’s Hong Kong branch. “But with the aggregate balance falling, interbank rates will climb gradually and press some lenders to hike prime rates.

that a government source in Ankara said would be channeled into its banks and financial markets.
The investment package was announced after Qatar's Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani met President Tayyip Erdogan in the capital, as Turkey grapples with a collapsing lira and a worsening commercial and political standoff with NATO ally the United States.
The currency  has lost nearly 40 percent against the dollar this year, driven by worries over Erdogan's growing influence on the economy and his repeated calls for lower interest rates despite high inflation.
Its precipitous decline has raised concerns about the resilience of Turkey's banking sector and caused ructions on global markets.
Following the Qatar news, the lira firmed briefly to 5.8699 from 6.04 to the dollar, before easing back to 6.0500 by 1658 GMT.
The currency had rebounded some 6 percent on Wednesday after the central bank squeezed lira liquidity in the market, effectively pushing up rates and supporting the currency.
Turkey and Qatar have traditionally maintained good ties.
Ankara stood by Doha after Saudi Arabia and other Arab states severed diplomatic, trade and travel ties with Qatar last year, accusing it of financing terrorism, a charge Doha denies.
Qatar's royal court released a statement saying Al-Thani ""issued directives that will see the State of Qatar to provide a host of economic projects, investments, and deposits"" worth $15 billion to support the Turkish economy.

Erdogan's spokesman praised Qatari-Turkish relations on Twitter. ""The fundamentals of the Turkish economy are robust and Turkey will emerge stronger from this process,"" Ibrahim Kalin wrote.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.05% to 96.60.
The lira rose sharply against the dollar for the second-straight day as Turkey doubled tariffs on some U.S. imports, including alcohol, cars and tobacco in retaliation for U.S. moves.
The rise in the lira did little to ease investor concerns as analysts warned that while Turkey may take measures to support the lira, the country's economy would likely plunge into a recession.
""A recession is on the horizon in Turkey, but the depth of the recession depends on the measures taken,"" ABN Amro said. ""Lower growth, higher interest rates and on balance a weaker currency would still make it difficult for certain [Turkish] companies to fulfill their external debt obligations, but a national debt crisis would be avoided."".
Concerns over Turkey saw demand for the safe-haven yen and Swiss franc increase, keeping gains in the greenback in check.
USD/JPY fell 0.40% to 111.72, while USD/CHF fell 0.01% to 0.9940.

The dollar was lower against the traditional safe haven yen, with USD/JPY losing 0.2% to trade at 110.93.
Investors often gravitate to the Japanese currency during times of financial or political turmoil.
The gains in the dollar came as the Turkish lira extended a modest recovery, with USD/TRY hitting an intraday low of 5.9230, before pulling back to 6.1215.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's rouble fell by close to a percentage point versus the dollar on Wednesday, resuming losses triggered by threats of more U.S. sanctions and the tanking Turkish lira. 
At 1021 GMT, the rouble was 0.98 percent lower against the dollar at 66.87 .
The rouble on Monday fell to 68.16 to the dollar, a level not seen since April 2016. It rallied somewhat on Tuesday, but came under renewed pressure on Wednesday from a stronger dollar.
The U.S. currency rose to multi-months highs on the back of the crisis in Turkey that boosted a sell-off in emerging markets and demand for the greenback as a safe-haven asset.
Dealers said that the brief strengthening of the rouble this week hastened the sell-off of the currency, because it allowed players on the market to buy dollars, their long-term preference, at a more favorable rate than earlier in the week.
Because of that trend, the rouble may again reach the level of 68.16 per dollar in the near future, said Igor Akinshin, a dealer at Alfa Bank.
Mikhail Poddubsky, an analyst at Promsvyazbank, said he expected the consolidation of the dollar/rouble pair near 65.80-67.30 in the near future.
""We believe that risk sentiment is likely to remain fragile in coming weeks – unless the Turkish regulators manage to engender market confidence,"" analysts at VTB Capital said in a note.
Versus the euro, the rouble was 0.77 percent weaker at 75.86 .
Kirill Tremasov, former head of the economy ministry's macroeconomic forecasting department and now head of research at Loko-Invest, said that investors will remain vigilant about sanctions risk for Russia.
The U.S. Congress published on Tuesday the text of a proposed bipartisan bill that among other things includes restrictions on investment in new Russian sovereign debt and bans several state-run Russian banks from operating in the United States.
""This set of restrictions will inevitably have a negative macroeconomic effect, which will further fuel our already stagnating situation in the economy,"" Tremasov said.

Russian stock indexes inched lower. The dollar-denominated RTS index (IRTS) was down 1.6 percent to 1,064.25 points, while its rouble-based peer MOEX (IMOEX) shed 0.9 percent to 2,262.58 points.

Signs the U.S. economy remains robust ahead of an expected interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve next month have seen the dollar dominate other currencies in recent weeks. 
A plunge in the lira which has hurt the euro on concerns about European banks' exposure to Turkey has driven further demand for the dollar along with other safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen. 
Against a basket of major currencies on Wednesday, the dollar rose to 96.862, its highest level since late June 2017. (DXY)
""In light of all the turmoil we've seen out of Turkey and the subsequent contagion into other emerging markets, the dollar is pretty much establishing itself as the safe-haven currency,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo branch manager at State Street Bank.
""If you are going to park your money somewhere to stay away from the turmoil, the dollar is going to be the currency of choice,"" he said.
The lira  has lost more than 40 percent of its value against the dollar this year, hit by worries over President Tayyip Erdogan's calls for lower interest rates and fraying ties with the United States.
On Wednesday, however, the lira recovered some ground to trade briefly at 5.7503 to the U.S. dollar, firming from a close of 6.3577 a day earlier.
The rebound to below 6.0 against the dollar was driven by a banking watchdog step to limit swap transactions and by hopes of improved EU relations.
Turkey's finance minister will also seek to reassure international investors in a conference call on Thursday.
Markets are concerned by President Tayyip Erdogan's influence over the economy and his resistance to interest rate increases to tackle double-digit inflation.
The rally in the dollar prompted selling in both the euro and the British pound. 
The single currency drifted down toward $1.13 for the first time since July 2017 (EUR=EBS) and sterling dipped below $1.27 for the first time since June last year.  
The euro is under pressure because of the impact of the Turkish lira collapse on euro zone banks with exposure to Turkey and due to concerns about a fiscal spending spree by the Italian government which is involved in a standoff with Brussels.
""The attractive rate advantage of U.S. bonds is strengthening demand for the dollar. Combined with doubts over the [monetary] normalization efforts of the European Central Bank this limits the upside potential in EUR-USD for now,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) FX analyst Esther Maria Reichelt.
Investors are worried that the market turbulence caused by Turkey's economic meltdown might delay the ECB’s normalization timetable, she said.
Investors remain nervous about the plunge in the lira, prompting capital outflows from other emerging markets that run hefty current account deficits and rely on foreign capital.
Against the yen , the dollar rose about 0.1 percent to about 111.27 yen.
The pound  hit a 13-month low, dropping 0.2 percent to $1.2694 on the back of weaker-than-forecast wage growth figures released on Tuesday.

""With the Bank of England unlikely to raise rates for some time (the market prices the next hike for 12 months' time), U.K. economic data will be a second-order consideration for the pound compared to Brexit negotiations for now,"" Nick Smyth, an interest rate strategist at BNZ Markets in Wellington, said in a note.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority bought HK$2.159 billion ($275 million) of local dollars during New York trading hours on Tuesday, according to the de facto central bank’s page on Bloomberg. The last intervention was on May 18. The city’s currency traded at HK$7.8499 as of 7:38 a.m. local time, close to the weak end of its permitted trading range of HK$7.75-7.85.
The widening interest rate gap between Hong Kong and the U.S. has driven carry trades that has led to outflows and weakened the local currency. The intervention also came as Hong Kong unexpectedly posted a quarter-on-quarter economic contraction for the three months ended June.
The HKMA has spent about HK$70 billion this year protecting the currency system, which has the effect of tightening liquidity in a city that’s enjoyed ultra-low borrowing costs as it imports U.S. monetary policy.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Alexei Nikolayev, one of more than 56 million Russians who re-elected President Vladimir Putin in March, is already counting the likely cost of a weaker ruble: less spending power abroad, higher prices at home, and another round of belt tightening.
But Nikolayev, a 56-year old graphic designer who enjoys foreign travel and imported wine, blames the West, not Putin, for the pain and has no regrets about voting for a politician he sees as the right man to guide Russia through troubled times.
""It's painful and it's unpleasant, but it won't change my politics,"" Nikolayev said of the ruble shedding 10 percent of its value against the dollar since the end of July, driven down largely by new U.S. sanctions on Russia.
""In fact, as strange as it may sound, it will only strengthen my convictions. They (the West) are trying to break Russia.""
Nikolayev's view that Putin is not to blame is held widely among Russians, according to Stepan Goncharov, a sociologist at the Levada Center pollster.
""People don't really understand the dynamics behind it and the president, traditionally, is safe from criticism,"" Goncharov told Reuters.
The narrative in Russia that the ruble's slide is the result of a Western plot has direct echoes with Turkey, Russia's ally whose lira currency slid to a record low on Monday. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said his country is the target of an economic war and has said Turkey will boycott some U.S. imports in retaliation.
In Russia, the falling ruble causes pain for some. The price of imported goods is likely to rise. Foreign vacations have also become more expensive.
Irina Turina, a spokeswoman for the Russian Travel Industry Union, said travel agents had seen demand for package holidays fall by 10-15 percent last week because of the ruble's volatility.
""People who have not yet paid in full for their holidays are rushing to pay off the rest even if they have no obligation to do so,"" Turina told Reuters, saying people were worried that the outstanding balance would be recalculated according to a higher, less favorable exchange rate.
""People who have not yet bought package holidays are also pausing for thought,"" she said. ""It's not just about paying for your holiday, you need spending money once you get there and people take dollars.""
SANGUINE MOOD
Nevertheless, early and anecdotal signs suggest many Russians, long inured to a volatile national currency, are stoical, even defiant, in the face of a falling ruble.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said last week that the sanctions on Russia had nothing to do with Moscow's behavior in places like Ukraine or Syria but were motivated by a U.S. need to keep economic rivals down.
That view finds favor with many Russians who have listened via state TV and taken in the Kremlin's anti-Western rhetoric for years.
Other Russians were simply sanguine about a ruble drop that has taken few by surprise because they have seen worse before.
""Nothing is forever, things will change somehow,"" said Moscow resident Gennady Tsurkan. ""Everything will always change for the better. I think that these days are not far off, I believe that.""
The fall in the ruble is much less severe than the currency crisis after 2014, when an economic slump coincided with the fallout from Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea.
Russia's exposure to ruble fluctuations is significantly less that it was four years ago.
Since that time, Russian companies have reduced their foreign borrowing, the state has cut the amount it needs to raise on Western debt markets, and the country imports fewer goods that it needs to pay for in dollars.
Putin's still-high approval rating has slipped in the past few months, but pollsters put that down to an unpopular proposed pension reform, not the weakness of the ruble.
Pollsters say while the ruble's weakness may fuel an emerging sense of discontent among some Russians sparked by the pension reform, it is unclear if it will catalyze protests or influence a political landscape which Putin has bestrode for over 18 years.
""If it does have an effect, it will be an indirect one, magnifying discontent over falling living conditions,"" said Levada Center's Goncharov.
Nikolayev, the Putin-supporting graphic designer, was philosophical.

""It's like sunshine or snow. I can't influence it. Maybe I'll have to drink a different kind of wine. Or maybe I'll have to buy one instead of two pairs of shoes. It's painful but not that painful.""

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The Turkish lira pulled back on Tuesday from a record low hit a day earlier, helped by the central bank's liquidity measures and news of a planned conference call in which the finance minister will seek to reassure investors.
The lira , which closed at 6.9 per dollar on Monday, has weakened 45 percent this year, hit by worries over President Tayyip Erdogan's calls for lower interest rates and worsening ties with the United States.
The weakness of the Turkish currency has rippled through global markets. Its drop of as much as 18 percent on Friday hit U.S. and European stocks as investors fretted about banks' exposure to Turkey.
Dollar-denominated bonds issued by selected Turkish banks continued to fall on Tuesday, although sovereign bonds steadied. The lira stood at 6.54 against the dollar at 0749 GMT, up around five percent on the day. 
Relations between NATO allies Turkey and the United States are at a low point, hurt by a series of issues from diverging interests in Syria, Ankara's plan to buy Russian defense systems and the detention of an American pastor, Andrew Brunson.
The White House on Monday said U.S. national security adviser John Bolton met Turkey's ambassador to the United States to discuss the detention of Brunson, on trial in Turkey over terrorism charges. Trump had asked for his immediate release.
Traders said news that Finance Minister Berat Albayrak will hold a conference call with up to 1,000 investors to discuss the economy might also have helped support the currency.
""I think the investor call Albayrak has scheduled has helped lira firm,"" said TEB Investment strategist Isik Okte. ""I believe the new and important topics will be discussed in this call, otherwise there would not be such an attempt.""
""The concerns are ongoing in the market but it is possible to mention a limited optimism for the first time in a while,"" a foreign exchange trader said.
Bankers said on Monday the central bank would meet banks' lira liquidity needs at the overnight rate of 19.25 percent -- 150 basis points above the benchmark weekly repo rate -- a move they said could be interpreted as a small, covert rate hike.
Analysts say the crisis has been a long time coming and reflects Turkey's refusal to raise interest rates to curb double-digit inflation and cool an overheated economy.
MEETING WITH BOLTON
Erdogan, rejecting economic fundamentals as the cause of lira weakness, said Turkey was the target of an economic war and has made repeated calls on Turks to sell their dollars and euros to shore up the national currency. He has also urged manufacturers not to rush to buy dollars.
Turkey's business lobbies called on Tuesday for a tighter monetary policy to stabilize the lira, and for diplomacy to solve U.S.-Turkish disputes.
Following Monday's meeting between Bolton and Turkish ambassador Serdar Kilic, U.S. officials have given no indication that the United States has been prepared to give ground in the standoff between the two countries' leaders.
Ankara has repeatedly said the Brunson issue was up to the courts and a Turkish judge moved Brunson from jail to house arrest in July. Infuriated by the move, which Washington said was insufficient, Trump sanctioned two Turkish ministers and doubled tariffs on metal imports, adding to lira's slide.
White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin was monitoring the financial situation in Turkey ""very closely"".
""This is no longer a dispute between the bureaucracies of the two countries. This is a fight between the two presidents now,"" said Soner Cagaptay, director of Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute.

Cagaptay said Washington had an ""arsenal of economic sanctions"" ready to deploy against Turkey, which he believed Trump would escalate until Brunson is released. ""And such a move will further feed Erdogan's narrative that 'The West is attacking us',"" he said.

The struggling currency sank to an all-time low of 7.1289 on Monday amid growing concern over a deepening diplomatic rift with the United States over Ankara's detention of Andrew Brunson, an American pastor detained in 2016.
Turkish authorities accuse Brunson of supporting a failed coup attempt earlier that year.
Worries about President Tayyip Erdogan's growing influence over the economy, and his reluctance to raise interest rates despite rising inflation have also weighed on the lira, which is down almost 70% this year.

583,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 02:59AM ET</span>",Rupee Breaches 70 Per Dollar as Turkey Rout Complicates RBI Job,"(Bloomberg) -- There’s not a moment of respite for India’s inflation-targeting central bank.
Just when gains in consumer prices eased, the Turkish lira-led sell-off in emerging-market currencies has renewed an onslaught on the rupee, pushing it to a record low and possibly demanding more rate action from the Reserve Bank of India.
The rupee dropped to as low as 70.08 per dollar on Tuesday, keeping its position as Asia’s worst-performing currency this year intact. It recouped some of the losses to trade at 69.8525, with traders saying state-run banks sold dollars, probably on behalf of the RBI, as the currency weakened past the 70-per dollar mark.
“Deteriorating emerging-market sentiment has led to a panic in the rupee,” said Paresh Nayar, the Mumbai-based head of currency and money markets at the local unit of South African lender FirstRand Ltd. The price action suggests the RBI might have intervened to prevent a bigger run on the rupee, he said.
A weaker currency complicates the central bank’s job of keeping prices in check, as it makes imports costlier. The monetary policy committee led by Governor Urjit Patel increased interest rates twice since June to curb rising price pressures, while the RBI depleted $23 billion in foreign reserves to check currency volatility.
Government data on Monday showed retail inflation quickened 4.17 percent in July from a year earlier, slower than the 4.5 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
“The weak rupee is indeed making life difficult for Patel and his fellow members of the monetary policy committee,” said Hugo Erken, a senior economist at Rabobank International in the Netherlands. “The RBI tightening cycle will put an end to the current free fall.”
A selloff in Turkey’s lira spread to other emerging-market currencies, with the rupee adding to Monday’s 1.6 percent loss -- which was its biggest since September 2013. Earlier this month, the RBI raised rates to the highest in two years against the backdrop of an economy that’s growing faster than any other major nation.
Indian sovereign bonds were trading slightly higher. The yield on the benchmark 10-year notes was down 1 basis point at 7.81 percent after rising seven basis points on Monday.
Global risks, such as high oil prices and trade tensions, are weighing on the growth outlook, the International Monetary Fund said in its recent report on India that likened the economy to an elephant that’s started to run. Despite the headwinds, the latest high-frequency indicators like the purchasing managers’ surveys show that India’s start to the July quarter has been strong.
“The good old issues of large unhedged exposure, worsening current-account deficit, worries on fiscal deficit and uncertainty heading into elections” are playing out once again in the backdrop of general concern around emerging markets, said Gopikrishnan MS, head of foreign exchange, rates and credit for South Asia at Standard Chartered Plc in Mumbai. With fresh pressure on EMs, the rupee is expected to move in a range of 71-72 against the dollar, he said.
The central bank’s position is that it does not target the exchange rate and is mandated to keep inflation at the 4 percent midpoint of its targeted band in the medium term. The RBI raised inflation forecast for the six months to March 31 to 4.8 percent from 4.7 percent.

“Turkey is faced with an economic siege. We are taking the necessary steps against these attacks and will continue to do so,” President Erdogan said on Monday.
Finance Minister Berat Albayrak, Erdogan’s son-in-law, said Sunday said that Turkey would implement an economic action plan, but did not give details on what the steps would be.
The lira last traded around 6.90 against the greenback, after dropped to a fresh all-time low of 7.24 earlier in the day.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The euro stood near a one-year low against the dollar and the Swiss franc on Tuesday, remaining under pressure as the Turkish lira wobbled on worries that Turkey's economic woes could hit European banks and spread to other emerging economies.
Investors are nervous the plunge in the lira could prompt capital outflows from other emerging economies that run a hefty current account deficit and rely on foreign capital.
The euro traded little changed at $1.1410 (EUR=), having fallen to a 13-month low of $1.1365 on Monday. So far this month it has lost 2.4 percent.
Investors have rushed to the safe haven Swiss franc, which hit a one-year high of 1.1288 franc per euro (EURCHF=) on Monday and last stood at 1.1337.
The Turkish lira slipped as much as 0.6 percent in early Asian trade on Tuesday to 6.955 per dollar , though it hovered above a record low of 7.24 hit on Monday after the central bank pledged to provide liquidity.
The currency last stood at 6.9349.
The lira has fallen almost 30 percent so far this month on concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan's reluctance to raise interest rates despite rising inflation and a deepening diplomatic rift with the United States.
""The Turkish lira remains volatile and it is too early to say the lira has settled down. For now, currencies will be driven by the Turkish lira,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.
""But the euro's fall on worries about European banks' exposure to Turkey seems a bit over done, considering that their scale is not that huge,"" he added.
Onshore Chinese yuan , which had retreated roughly 0.7 percent the previous day, falling along with its emerging market peers, was a shade firmer at 6.8851 per dollar.
The yuan's bounce was limited following the release of downbeat economic indicators, and it remained in reach of a 15-month trough of 6.8965 set earlier this month.
China's economy is showing further signs of cooling as the U.S. prepares to impose even tougher trade tariffs, with investment in the first seven months of the year slowing to a record low and retail sales softening, data released on Tuesday showed.
The yen, often perceived to be a safe haven because of Japan's net creditor status, edged back against the dollar along with a slight ebb in risk aversion, with the Nikkei (N225) bouncing more than 1 percent after two days of steep losses on Turkish jitters.
The dollar was 0.05 percent higher at 110.79 yen , off a 1-1/2-month low of 110.10 touched on Monday.
The greenback was also helped against the yen by rises in U.S. bond yields. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield (US10YT=RR) bounced back to 2.877 percent from a three-week low of 2.848 percent.
""The initial reaction emerging economies usually take in a currency crisis is to dip into their foreign reserves. That means they sell U.S. Treasuries, boosting their yields, which helps to lift the dollar against the yen,"" said Makoto Noji, chief currency strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
Already on Monday, Indonesia's central bank intervened to defend the rupiah while India's central bank was seen intervening after the rupee hit a record low.
The South African rand  also fell more than 10 percent at one point on Monday to hit a two-year low of 15.70 to the dollar, although it later pared much of losses. It last stood at 14.31.

Argentina's currency fell 2.4 percent to close at a record low 29.97 per dollar on Monday, as a local corruption scandal added to its woes, prompting the country's central bank to hike interest rates by 5 percentage points to 45 percent.

That’s the view of Charles Feng, head of macro trading for Greater China at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc., even as drama in Turkey rattles markets worldwide. Factors pressuring the yuan -- such as trade tension and easing China monetary policy -- are almost priced in, while there’s limited room for the dollar to rise further, he said. Investors could also start seeing a bottom for mainland stocks, which are down more than 20 percent from this year’s peak.
Hong Kong-based Feng, who oversees foreign-exchange, rates and local-currency corporate bond trading, said there’s a “good chance” of a retracement in the yuan that could be as rapid as the recent declines, if the dollar weakens. China isn’t likely to intervene heavily provided the moves are in line with economic fundamentals or the overall dollar direction, he said.
The yuan is Asia’s worst performing currency over the past three months, sliding around 8 percent against the dollar as trade friction with the U.S. heated up and the People’s Bank of China took easing steps to support the economy. Policy makers have made it more expensive to short the yuan and urged banks to avoid “herd behavior” in the currency market. While a weaker yuan could help exporters better cope with U.S. tariff hikes, it also risks denting foreign interest in onshore assets.

The best China trade in the short-term is risk-free bonds, as liquidity is flush and concern lingers over credit default risks, said Feng, who has been a trader for more than a decade.

“I’m convinced this downward spiral can be stopped,” said Joachim Wuermeling, an executive board member at Germany’s Bundesbank, which spent decades defending the Deutsche mark before the introduction of the euro. “There are classic instruments Turkey can use. But bold action is missing,” said Wuermeling, who helps supervise the region’s largest banks.
Turkey is in turmoil as a face-off with the U.S. compounds issues built up by years of growth-at-all-costs policies. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has vowed the country won’t use higher interest rates to bolster the currency and choke consumer-price growth. The lira has lost about a quarter of its value against the dollar since the U.S. sanctioned two government ministers, pushing the economy toward a full-blown financial meltdown.
Wuermeling said there’s no need to “over dramatize” the risk that Turkey’s problems will infect the euro area. The Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index fell 2.6 percent over the last week, led by lenders with direct exposure to the country through their units there. Wuermeling said supervisors have the option to order banks to hold more capital against Turkey assets.
While Turkey’s central bank raised borrowing costs to 17.75 percent in June from 8 percent in April, it hasn’t tightened since. In a July 24 policy decision, the first since Erdogan won re-election along with sweeping new powers, officials bowed to political pressure to refrain from raising rates again. Erdogan holds some unorthodox economic views, notably that cheaper credit leads to slower inflation.
“A country that relies on foreign creditors for half of its financing needs, can’t lastingly ignore the rules of global financial markets without suffering damage,” Wuermeling said in an interview in Frankfurt Monday. “Turkey shows the bad that can happen if central bank independence is ignored.”
A 45 percent slide since the start of the year makes the lira the second worst global currency after Venezuela’s bolivar. The depreciation has stoked an inflation rate that breached 15 percent last month, more than triple the official target.
The European Central Bank has the option of crisis-proofing lenders by ordering them to increase reserves for risks, he said. Wuermeling who is a member of the ECB’s supervisory board, said it hasn’t yet seen the need to call an emergency meeting on Turkey.

In times of turmoil, supervisors generally ask banks about their liquidity, their exposure to troubled markets and what collateral they hold. The Bundesbank doesn’t see a need to make “supervisory demands” according to Wuermeling. While the country’s banks, which have 20.8 billion euros ($23.7 billion) of risk tied to Turkey, none of the major European lenders with extensive operations in Turkey are German.
On the monetary policy front, the Bundesbanker said he doesn’t see any reason to put in place currency swap lines to maintain Turkey’s access to euros.
“It’s up to Turkish authorities to engage in confidence-fostering measures to ensure creditors don’t withdraw their money,” he said.

589,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 11:47AM ET</span>",That sinking feeling? Sterling traders prepare for Brexit meltdown,"By Tommy Wilkes, Ritvik Carvalho and Tom Finn
LONDON (Reuters) - Having sunk to 13-month lows, sterling could fall by up to another 10 percent in the coming months should Britain crash out of the European Union without a deal on future trade ties, luring more speculators to bet against the currency.
Sterling lost almost two percent last week just as British holidaymakers were heading off for some overseas sun . The latest move lower was kickstarted by trade minister Liam Fox's warning that, with Britain less than eight months from its scheduled EU departure date in March, there was a 60 percent chance of leaving without a deal.
The moves were certainly exacerbated by a big and broad dollar rally, and the pound has since clawed back the worst of its losses against the euro, rebounding from 10-month lows (EURGBP=D3).
But the worry, say analysts, is that in the absence of any conclusive developments towards a deal over the coming months, the pound's spiral will accelerate while the clock ticks down on the deadline and hedge funds are tempted into betting against the currency. 
And muddying the horizon are major political events - Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party conference in early October, and meetings of EU leaders in late September and then mid-October. 
""There's no guaranteed date for when Brexit progress or hard Brexit will be known by apart from exit day on 29 March 2019,"" Nomura analysts told clients, describing a ""hard Brexit"" as a ""cliff edge"" moment in which Britain crashes out of the EU in March 2019 without any future trading arrangements in place.
""We find that we are very much in the early stages of pricing for a hard Brexit.""
Pound vs U.S. dollar: https://reut.rs/2vEBpYn
How will sterling trade in the later stages, then?
Most economists still believe Britain will reach a deal with the EU. But the latest Reuters polls indicate risk of no deal have risen to 25 percent, versus 20 percent in July. 
Some bookmakers price even higher odds, above 40 percent.
If that comes to pass, Britain's currency would crash to $1.20 - from today's $1.2750 levels, the Reuters poll showed, a fall of around 6 percent. But sterling is forecast to rise to $1.34 by end-January if an agreement is reached. 
Others predict more precipitous falls - Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) sees a 10 percent drop against the dollar and euro. That would leave the pound close to parity with the single currency, below post-Brexit referendum lows of 94 pence and current levels of 89.2 pence. 
The uncertain outlook and the prospect of a sudden sterling surge had kept many hedge funds on the sidelines. Now though, sensing profits to be made, some funds have begun to wager against the pound. Prominent Brexit campaigner and hedge fund boss Crispin Odey told Reuters he was betting against sterling.
He predicts it will hit $1.21 before March.
OPTIONS FLASH RED
Concern may be mounting at the corporate level too. A senior currencies trader at a large European bank said British exporters had rushed to hedge themselves, while speculators were using options to short the pound in increasing numbers.
""Below the $1.30 mark is where corporates start to get nervous,"" the trader said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ""Hedge funds have been buyers of sterling on the dips but that's starting to change. If it weakens further, we will see some accelerated selling.""
Perhaps reflecting that shift, the price investors are prepared to pay for the future right to sell sterling has rocketed.
Demand for options to sell sterling climbs to highest since Jan 2017: https://reut.rs/2MfsQg0
Three-month sterling/dollar risk reversals , a gauge of put-to-call options, have plunged to their weakest level since January 2017, indicating heightened demand for 'puts' -- derivatives that give holders the right to sell an asset.
'Call' options give the right to buy.
As Brexit approaches, more wild price swings are likely.
Sterling/dollar three-month and six-month implied volatility gauges , which measure price swing expectations, have shot to their highest since February. Nine-month  implied volatility, which covers the official March 29, 2019 Brexit date, has spiked even further, to 17-month highs. 
Even relatively stable euro/sterling three-month  implied volatility is at its highest since March. 
Pound volatility gauges spike to highest since February: https://reut.rs/2MfrQbK
CHEAP AS CHIPS?
Yet shorting sterling remains a risky play. 
Should Britain retain close trading ties with the EU, the pound could jump towards its post-Brexit referendum high of $1.4377 reached in April. A Brexit on these terms would also clear the path for the Bank of England to tighten monetary policy further.
Sterling also looks cheap, according to some historical measures. 
Using the real effective exchange rate or REER gauge -- a currency's value against trade partners' currencies, adjusted for inflation -- sterling is six percent below its five-year average, and 16 percent below its 20-year average.
Under the purchasing-power parity, or PPP, theory, which compares the prices of a basket of goods, sterling/dollar should trade at $1.61, and euro/sterling at 80 pence.
""Sure, there is gloom now but the currency remains undervalued as it has been historically,"" said Geoffrey Yu, Head of UK Investment Office at UBS Wealth Management. ""Some [buyers] will see this as an opportunity.""

EUR/USD edged up to 1.1423 by 09:33 AM ET (13:33 GMT) after falling as low as 1.1365 overnight, its weakest level since early July 2017.
After briefly rising back above the 7 lira to the dollar level, USD/TRY was last at 6.8921, still up 7.62% for the day. The pair hit a record high of 7.1326 overnight.
The lira pared back some of its losses after Turkey’s central bank pledged to provide liquidity and cut lira and foreign currency reserve requirements for Turkish banks.
Deteriorating relations between the U.S. and Ankara have seen the lira tumble more than 40% this year, and lose a fifth of its value against the dollar in the last week alone.
The currency has also been pressured lower by worries about President Tayyip Erdogan's increasing control over monetary policy and the economy and his opposition to higher interest rates.
Speaking in Ankara on Monday, Erdogan said his country is under an economic “siege” that has nothing to do with its economic indicators, but predicted that Turkey would overcome the “attack” on its economy.
He insisted that Turkey’s economy remains strong and said the currency would soon settle “at the most reasonable level.”
The selloff in the lira has roiled financial markets amid fears over companies’ exposure to the Turkish currency and economy. The European Central Bank warned Friday that a number of euro zone banks might be exposed to the sharp decline in the lira.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, eased 0.09% to 96.10 after rising to a 13-month high of 96.39 earlier.
The safe haven yen pared gains against the dollar and the euro, with USD/JPY last at 110.77, after falling to a one-and-a-half month low of 110.11 earlier.
EUR/JPY was at 126.49, rebounding from an intra-day low of 125.13.
Elsewhere in emerging markets, Russia’s ruble pared back losses, with USD/RUB at 67.6786 after earlier falling to its lowest level since mid-April 2016, weighed down by the broadly stronger dollar, falling oil prices and concerns over the impact of a fresh round of U.S. sanctions.
South Africa’s rand pulled back from a two-year low against the dollar, with USD/ZAR last at 14.3034.
India’s rupee remained close to record lows against the U.S. currency, with USD/INR advancing 1.13% to 69.87. Reuters reported that the Reserve Bank of India staged a mild intervention to curtail volatility overnight."
591,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>",Turkey Meltdown Propels Lira Volatility Above Bitcoin,"(Bloomberg) -- The Turkish lira is so volatile it’s making Bitcoin look tame by comparison.
The 10-day swings in the lira relative to the U.S. dollar now exceed those for Bitcoin amid Turkey’s escalating currency crisis.
This phenomenon hasn’t happened since April 2017, shortly following Turkey’s constitutional referendum. There are signs that Turks are losing faith in their domestic currency and pursuing alternative mediums of exchange in light of the precipitous decline in the lira.
Bitcoin’s volatility has hindered its mainstream adoption as a source of payment, preventing it from acting as a reliable store of value. The amount of the cryptocurrency used to purchase goods and services has been steadily declining.
Though Bitcoin has been slightly more stable than the lira lately, it’s still traveled a rockier road in 2018. Year to date, the digital currency is down 55 percent versus 45 percent for the lira.

592,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 06:41AM ET</span>","Turkish lira pulls back from record low, markets rattled","By Daren Butler and Nevzat Devranoglu
ISTANBUL/ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's lira pulled back from a record low of 7.24 to the dollar on Monday after the central bank pledged to provide liquidity and cut reserve requirements for Turkish banks, but its meltdown continued to rattle global markets.
The currency has lost more than 40 percent against the dollar this year, largely over worries about President Tayyip Erdogan's influence over the economy, his repeated calls for lower interest rates, and worsening ties with the United States.
On Friday that relentless slide turned into a crash: the lira dropped as much as 18 percent, hitting U.S. and European stocks as investors took fright over banks' exposure to Turkey.
The fresh lira collapse on Sunday night hit Asian shares, weakened South Africa's rand and drove demand in global markets for safe currencies including the dollar, Swiss franc and yen. Shares in Europe's major banks also lost ground.
The central bank, which surprised markets last month when it left interest rates unchanged despite double-digit inflation and the tumbling lira, announced the moves on liquidity and reserves after Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said authorities would start implementing an economic action plan on Monday.
Bankers also said the central bank would meet banks' lira liquidity needs at the overnight rate of 19.25 percent -- 150 basis points above the benchmark weekly repo rate -- though it might not use the overnight funding on Monday because lira liquidity needs were low.
They said the bank's decision could be the first step toward tightening policy through the use of an interest rate corridor, an instrument used in previous years, rather than an increase in the benchmark rate.
The bank said it cut the lira reserve requirement ratio, a cash buffer held by banks, by 250 basis points for all maturity brackets and lowered reserve requirement ratios for non-core FX liabilities by 400 bps for maturities up to three years.
The moves will free up 10 billion lira, $6 billion, and $3 billion equivalent of gold liquidity in the financial system, the bank said. It also pledged to provide ""all the liquidity banks need"".
While the measures should ease worries over financial stability, they will have no direct impact on the lira because they do not affect banks' foreign exchange positions,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) strategist Erkin Isik said in a note.
Isik said the lira's current levels would add between 4 and 5 percentage points to headline inflation in coming months, pushing it up to around 21 percent in September from nearly 16 percent last month.
On Sunday night Turkey's banking watchdog BBDK said it was limiting banks' foreign exchange swap transactions.

RECORD LOW
The lira <TRYTOM=D3>, which hit a record low of 7.24 against the dollar in Asian trading, pared losses after Albayrak's comments and the central bank announcement, strengthening briefly to 6.4. It was trading at 6.8700 per dollar at 1024 GMT.
Turkish bank shares (XBANK) fell to their lowest level in dollar terms since November 2003 and their dollar bonds and Turkey's sovereign dollar debt tumbled. Stocks (XU100) dropped 4 percent, with the BIST index of blue-chip stocks (XU030) down around 50 percent in dollar terms this year.
Albayrak said in an interview published on Sunday that Turkey will start implementing an economic plan to ease investor concerns, stressing budget discipline and pledging that fiscal rules would be implemented for targeted indicators if necessary.
""We will be taking the necessary steps with our banks and banking watchdog in a speedy manner,"" he said, ruling out any seizure or conversion of dollar-denominated bank deposits into lira.
Market analysts broadly welcomed his comments but said investors wanted to see action.
""It’s purely technical and Turkey needs a complete rebalancing of its economic business plan, and very sharp rate hikes and a strong commitment that the central bank will be independent,""  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR)'s senior emerging markets strategist Guillaume Tresca said.
But a drastic rate hike was unlikely because of the damage it would do to Turkey's corporate sector, while any capital controls would close off access to foreign exchange for companies already short of dollars, Tresca said.
Turkey would also be reluctant to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund after clearing billions of dollars of debt to the fund under Erdogan.
In the interview with Hurriyet newspaper, Albayrak described the lira's weakness as ""an attack"" -- echoing Erdogan, who is his father-in-law.
Erdogan, a self-styled ""enemy of interest rates,"" wants cheap credit from banks to fuel growth, but investors fear the economy is overheating and could be set for a hard landing.
On Sunday Erdogan said the lira's free-fall was the result of a plot and did not reflect economic fundamentals.
""What is the reason for all this storm in a tea cup? There is no economic reason... This is called carrying out an operation against Turkey,"" he said.
The interior ministry said on Monday it was taking legal action against 346 social media accounts that had posted comments about the weakening of the lira ""in a provocative way"".

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro slid to a fresh 13-month low and emerging market currencies slumped further on Monday, while the yen surged to a six-week high as the fallout from the Turkish lira's crash pushed more investors into safe-haven currencies. 
As investors dumped riskier assets in Asian trading and into the European open, the Swiss franc jumped to within a whisker of a one-year high against the euro (EURCHF=).
Emerging market currencies continued to reel as investors worried about contagion. The South African rand was down 3.1 percent  after falling more than 10 percent in earlier trading, the Russian rouble dropped 0.8 percent (RUB=) and the Mexican peso 1.5 percent .
After hitting a record low of 7.24 against the dollar early on Monday, Turkey's plummeting lira found some support after Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said the government had drafted an economic action plan to ease investor concerns and the banking watchdog said it had limited swap transactions.
""The big fear in the market is that we are headed for a full-blown emerging market crisis,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, an FX strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt, citing the 1997 Asian financial crisis when even countries with a sound macroeconomic position were sucked into a deep sell-off.
Leuchtmann said he believed that ""we are fundamentally in a different position"" because many emerging market central banks retained the confidence of the market after hiking interest rates over the past year.

596,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 12, 2018 10:50PM ET</span>",Lira Extends Slide as Turkey Heads Toward a Financial Crisis,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey’s lira extended its precipitous slide Monday, with the selloff spreading to other emerging-market currencies, after the nation’s president showed no signs of backing down in a standoff with the U.S.
The lira weakened past 7.23 per dollar amid thin volume before paring losses after the nation’s Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency stepped in to limit swap transactions on the battered currency. Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said the nation will announce steps to calm markets on Monday, Hurriyet newspaper reported.
The reported measures “have evidently had some impact in pulling the lira back higher,” said Ray Attrill, head of foreign exchange strategy at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Sydney. Still, “there’s nothing as yet to suggest that the government, or Turkish central bank, is poised to announce the fiscal or monetary policy measures capable of quickly restoring confidence in Turkey.”
The Turkish currency has been a casualty of a deepening crisis spurred by the administration’s growth-at-all-costs agenda and a worsening spat with the U.S., which sanctioned Turkey over the detention of an American priest. The lira’s plunge to a new record low and fears of a contagion sparked tremors through global markets on Monday, dragging a gauge for emerging-market currencies to the lowest in more than a year.
The dollar climbed as much as 13 percent to 7.2362 against the lira, with some banks said to avoid providing two-way prices amid unprecedented volatility. The South African rand fell to its weakest in more than two years, while the Mexican peso dropped 2 percent against the greenback.
EM Volatility
“The decline in the lira is multifaceted, caused not only by a weak external position in terms of current account deficit and inadequate currency reserves, but also the challenging political environment which exacerbates the vulnerabilities in the lira,” said Kerry Craig, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “This may fuel volatility in EM assets and dampen investor sentiment in the near term, as markets are already skittish.”
The extended rout in the lira also weighed on the euro and the Australian dollar, while spurring haven demand. The Aussie fell 0.4 percent against the dollar, while the yen strengthened against every Group-of-10 peer and Treasuries were bought.
“It’s still the case that the euro and Australian dollar are most readily in the firing line, given concerns over euro zone exposure to Turkey and the Aussie’s status as the market’s preferred EM/risk proxy,” NAB’s Attrill said of the impact of the falling lira on Group-of-10 currencies.
The sell-off also represents a vote of no-confidence in a new system of government that earlier this year handed President Recep Tayyip Erdogan unrivaled authority, essentially paralyzing the bureaucracy in Ankara. In speeches Sunday, Erdogan remained defiant, vowing never to give in on interest-rate hikes. He also ruled out an agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
Runaway Inflation
Years of a growth-at-all-costs policy bias have left Turkey’s companies saddled with hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign debt, runaway inflation and one of the world’s largest current-account deficits.
“Rate hikes would not be enough, with Turkish officials needing to create a credibility shock,” Guillaume Tresca, senior emerging market strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) CIB, wrote in a Aug. 10 note. “A complete rebalancing of the economy is needed, with a new economic team and a real commitment to the central bank’s independence.”
Turkey’s central bank -- which has raised its main policy rate to 17.75 percent -- unexpectedly refrained from a further hike at its last meeting. While investors are pleading for dramatic central bank action to bolster the lira, Turkish officials fear that even a huge increase in borrowing costs could be quickly offset by another round of U.S. sanctions, according to two people familiar with the thinking of the country’s economic administration.
A Turkish acknowledgment of the dangers ahead is nevertheless needed to soothe markets and even if the central bank provides only a stop-gap solution, it should still be done, according to Refet Gurkaynak, a professor of economics at Bilkent University in Ankara.
“It will signal that they are not looking at off-market solutions such as capital controls, conversion of FX deposits"" and other unorthodox policies, he said. “To work, it will have to be large and would have to be accompanied by a ‘whatever it takes’ statement.""
Turkey’s government debt plummeted on Friday, driving the yield on 10-year debt to a record close of 22.11 percent. Five-year credit-default swaps -- the cost to insure the bonds against default -- climbed 75 basis points to 453 basis points Friday evening in New York, the highest level since March 2009, CMA data showed.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The internationalization of the renminbi has made progress, Zhou Xiaochuan, former governor of China's central bank, said on Saturday.
""The internationalization of the renminbi is not a linear progress. It will move faster when there are opportunities to do so. Sometimes, it will move more slowly. But in the longer view, the internationalization of the renminbi is still promising,"" Zhou said at a financial forum in Shanghai.
Zhou said that the development of financial sanctions would have some impact on the US dollar's use as an international reserve currency and as an international means of payment. Diversification was important for reserve currencies, and the renminbi and other currencies would begin to be considered internationally, he said.
Zhou stepped down in March after 15 years at the helm of the People's Bank of China.

599,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 01:25PM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar Rides Euro Slump Above Year High Amid Turkish Lira Rout,"Investing.com - The dollar rose to fresh 2018 highs against its rivals Friday after the euro slumped on concerns about European banks' exposure to Turkey as the country's currency crashed.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.88% to 96.30.
Turkey's lira dropped to a record low against the dollar after President Donald Trump doubled metals tariffs on Turkey. That stoked investor concerns about Turkey's ability to pay its debts, leaving many fearing the fallout could spread beyond Turkey's border.
Fears of market contagion were somewhat justified after reports surfaced that the European Central Bank was assessing its exposure to Turkey.
Data from the Bank for International Settlements showed that banks in Spain, France and Italy had the highest exposure to the Turkish economy at the end of the first quarter, adding up to $81 billion, $35 billion and $18 billion respectively.
Analysts, however, were quick to downplay the impact on European banks, citing most of the exposure was to Turkish equity, and not a falling lira.
""Spanish banks are not owed US$83.3bn and French banks are not owed in FX, this is local bank subsidiaries' balance sheets in Turkey, which are mostly in lira,"" Tim Ash, EM sovereign debt strategist at BlueBay, said.
""European banks' exposure in Turkey through these subsidiaries is really just limited to equity,"" Ash said.
That did little to stop investors betting against the euro, however, as the single currency suffered its biggest slump in more than a year, underpinning the greenback.
EUR/USD fell 1.15% to $1.1396.
Upbeat U.S. consumer inflation data, meanwhile, supported the dollar's advanced, reaffirming investor expectations for the Federal Reserve to hike rates twice more this year.
The Labor Department said on Thursday its consumer price index  rose 0.2% last month, and core CPI rose 2.4% last month, higher than economists' estimates.
GBP/USD fell 0.62% to $1.2748 as data showing the U.K. economy steadied in the second quarter of year was overshadowed by ongoing fears of a no-deal Brexit.
The yen, meanwhile, strengthened as the rout of the Turkey's lira triggered safe-haven demand.
USD/JPY fell 0.36%% to Y110.68, USD/CAD rose 0.74% to C$1.3144."
600,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>","Trump escalates feud with Turkey, imposing higher metals tariffs","By Lisa Lambert
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump intensified his spat with Turkey on Friday by imposing higher tariffs on metal imports, putting unprecedented economic pressure on a NATO ally and deepening turmoil in Turkish financial markets.
Criticizing the state of the U.S. relationship with Ankara, Trump announced on Twitter that he had authorized a doubling of duties on aluminum and steel imported from Turkey, making them 20 percent and 50 percent respectively.
The White House said Trump would use a section of U.S. law that allows for tariffs on national security grounds to impose the increased duties.
Washington and Ankara have been at odds for months over an American pastor detained in Turkey, the Syrian civil war and other diplomatic issues. 
Trump's move sent Turkey's lira currency deeper into tailspin. The lira, which has long been falling on worries about the government's influence over monetary policy and the U.S. tensions, plunged more than 18 percent at one point on Friday to a record low against the dollar.
Even before Trump's announcement, President Tayyip Erdogan told Turks to exchange gold and dollars for lira in order to fight ""an economic war."" Waves from the crisis spread abroad, with investors selling off shares in European banks with large exposure to the Turkish economy. nL5N1V12A6] 
""I have just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency, the Turkish Lira, slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar!"" Trump said in an early morning post on Twitter.
""Aluminum will now be 20 percent and Steel 50 percent. Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!""
The United States, the world's biggest steel importer, imposed tariffs of 10 percent on aluminum and 25 percent on steel in March for imports from a variety of countries. Turkey is the sixth-largest steel exporter to the United States.
Ankara sent a delegation this week to Washington to meet with both the State and Treasury Departments to resolve some of the disputes but those talks showed no signs of breakthrough.
Last week, the United States imposed sanctions on Turkey's justice minister and interior minister for not releasing U.S. pastor Andrew Brunson. 
Brunson, an evangelical Presbyterian pastor from North
Carolina, was jailed for allegedly supporting a group that
Ankara blames for an attempted coup in 2016. Brunson denies the
charge. His cause resonates with Christian conservative supporters of Trump, who could also be influential as Republicans seek to retain control of Congress in midterm elections in November.
'UNCHARTED WATERS'
Trump and Turkey's Erdogan have had an up-down relationship.
At the U.N. General Assembly last year, Trump called Erdogan a ""friend"" who got ""very high marks"" for how he runs the country. 
Just weeks ago, Trump was reported to have fist-bumped Erdogan during a NATO meeting in Brussels.
Aaron Stein, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, said Trump has ""personalized the Brunson issue and feels like Erdogan cheated him.""
""We are in uncharted waters here. No idea how this ends, or where Ankara wants to take this but it’s going to be a wild ride,” Stein said.
In addition to the Brunson case, Washington is seeking the release of three locally employed U.S. embassy staff. Trade issues and differences over Syria have also strained bilateral ties. 
Turkey also wants the United States to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a Pennsylvania-based Muslim cleric who Turkish authorities say masterminded the coup attempt against Erdogan in which 250 people were killed. Gulen denies the allegation. 

Turkey, home to the Incirlik air base which is used by U.S. forces in the Middle East, has been a NATO member since the 1950s and a close ally of the United States.

601,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",Ruble Dives the Most Since the Oil Crash in 2015,"(Bloomberg) -- The ruble is suffering its worst weekly slump since the 2015 oil crash as some of Wall Street’s biggest banks warn investors to steer clear of Russian assets amid mounting risks of crippling sanctions from the U.S.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) turned bearish and UBS Group AG closed its recommendation to buy the Russian currency, with analysts at both banks saying in notes published on Thursday that the risks outweigh the reward for owning the ruble. Diana Amoa, a money manager at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management, puts the likelihood of curbs on Russian sovereign debt at as high as 50 percent.
The ruble is down 6.3 percent this week as contagion from the crisis in Turkey compounded tensions with the U.S. Russia’s currency traded 1.4 percent weaker at 67.5875 versus the dollar as of 6:41 p.m. in Moscow.
A fresh batch of sanctions introduced this week added to mounting concerns that the U.S. is about to start ratcheting up the severity of its restrictions against Russia. The worst-case scenario is a bill introduced in Washington last week that seeks penalties on banking transactions and new Russian sovereign debt as punishment for meddling in the 2016 presidential elections.
“Geopolitics is what keeps us all up,” Amoa said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Friday. “We’ve seen a lot of sanctions coming through ahead of the mid-term elections. I think there is an incentive to send a strong message that the U.S. will not allow interference in their democratic processes.”
Amoa said she has reduced holdings of Russian assets because the tail risk from potential sanctions is “just too large.” High foreign ownership of Russian sovereign debt means that sanctions would have a big impact on bond yields, she said. Foreigners held about 28 percent of the nation’s outstanding ruble debt as of July 1, according to central bank data.
Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have called for tough measures against Russia in the wake of last month’s summit between President Donald Trump and his counterpart Vladimir Putin. Still, the outlook for passage of the bill submitted last week remains uncertain, particularly since the U.S. Treasury warned that sanctioning sovereign debt could cause instability in global markets.
The U.S. is more likely to apply sanctions selectively to avoid “collateral damage” than to pass the bill in full, according to Tilmann Kolb, an analyst at UBS. Pressure on Russia, however, is only likely to rise further in the near term, he said in a note.
No decision can be taken on the bill until the House returns from summer recess next month, leaving a cloud of uncertainty over markets until then. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said that could leave the Russian Finance Ministry struggling to find enough buyers for the equivalent of $3 billion it can still borrow this year, of which $800 million would be swapped for sovereign bonds that are outstanding.
“The ruble remains highly sensitive to potential new legislation from the U.S.,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Hans Redeker said in a research note. “We think that political risk will weigh on sentiment and increase the ruble risk premium as we head into September.”"
602,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",Euro Becomes Collateral Damage as Trump Amps Up Turkey Pressure,"(Bloomberg) -- As U.S. President Donald Trump takes aim at Turkey, the euro is getting caught in the crossfire.
Turkey’s lira plunged to a record low Friday amid escalating tension over the detention of an American pastor, with Trump ordering some tariffs on Turkish metals to be doubled. The carnage quickly spread from emerging to developed markets: The euro sank as much as 1 percent to the weakest in more than a year, extending a drop triggered earlier by a Financial Times report that the European Central Bank raised concern about European banks’ exposure to Turkey.
Barring a quick resolution to the U.S.-Turkey feud, the common currency will continue to suffer amid worries about the vulnerability of European financial institutions, according to Shahab Jalinoos,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG’s global head of FX trading strategy.
“As long as the market suspects the European banking sector has an exposure, it will weigh on the euro, even if that’s hard to quantify,” Jalinoos said. “It will be sold on rallies unless Turkey suddenly gets cleared up, especially as the market knows the euro has its own Italy budget risk still ahead.”
The euro fell as low as $1.1414 Friday, and is now down almost 5 percent this year versus the dollar. Jalinoos has his sights set on the euro’s 200-week moving average at $1.1367 as the next point to watch. He said that level acted as resistance in the second half of 2016.
The greenback gained against almost all major and emerging-market currencies Friday, underscoring the haven appeal that’s boosting it to the likely dismay of the U.S. president.

603,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 11:03AM ET</span>","Rouble, caught in 'perfect storm', sinks to lowest since mid-2016","By Andrey Ostroukh and Polina Nikolskaya
MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian rouble sank to its lowest level since early June 2016 on Friday, battered by concerns over the impact of new U.S. sanctions, falling oil prices and a broadly stronger dollar.
The rouble briefly hit 67.67 against the dollar, losing around 6 percent of its value since the start of the week on U.S. sanctions fears.
""The Russian currency has been caught in a perfect storm of weakening crude oil prices and the new US sanctions, in addition to the threat of even tougher punitive measures in the coming months,"" said Lilit Gevorgyan, an economist at IHS Markit. 
The United States announced new measures on Wednesday targeting Russia that pushed the rouble sharply lower and sparked a wider sell-off over fears Russia was locked in a spiral of never-ending sanctions. 
In attempt to lift some pressure from the tanking rouble, the central bank cut its foreign currency buying on Wednesday.
Analysts doubt, however, that authorities will take much action to support the falling rouble, as they decided not to intervene during a similar sell-off in April, which was also driven by U.S. sanctions.
At 1457 GMT the rouble was 1.1 percent weaker against the dollar at 67.43 . The Russian currency had gained 0.1 percent to 76.98 versus the euro .
As the Turkish lira sent tremors through the emerging markets by hitting all-time lows, analysts at Rosbank said the rouble was hit more by the situation in emerging markets than by concerns about new sanctions.
Looking forward, the market was betting on the rouble to regain some ground.
Konstantin Kostrub, head of trading operations at ING Commercial Banking in Moscow said he expected the rouble to stabilise around 66.00-67.00 per dollar in the near future.
The rouble could recover if the flow of news about sanctions tapers off, but a further rouble drop to 68 per dollar cannot be ruled out, said Denis Davydov, economist at Nordea Bank in Moscow.
STOCKS TAKE HIT
Russian stock indexes were also hit by sanctions and investors' efforts to minimise exposure to Russian assets.
""The Russian equity market and the rouble have been hit for the second time since the start of 2018, highlighting the significance of geopolitical risk for investors in Russia,"" Gevorgyan from IHS Markit said.
The dollar-denominated RTS index (IRTS) was down 3.2 percent to 1,062.4 points, its lowest level since April 11. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index (IMOEX) was 1.7 percent lower at 2,269.9 points.
Moves in stock indexes were exacerbated by a proposal by a Kremlin economic aide to raise more revenue for the state from metal and mining companies.
The letter, seen by Reuters, lists  Evraz  (L:EVRE), NLMK (MM:NLMK), Nornickel (MM:GMKN), Severstal (MM:CHMF), MMK (MM:MAGN), Mechel (MM:MTLR), Alrosa (MM:ALRS), Polyus (MM:PLZL), Phosagro (MM:PHOR) and Acron (MM:AKRN) among those the state could target.
""Since the weight of these sectors is about 12 percent in the MOEX index, the pressure is noticeable,"" analysts at Raiffeisen said in a note.
President Vladimir Putin has ordered that the proposal deigned to raise 500 billion roubles ($7.5 billion) a year from metal and mining firms be looked at, but no decision has been made yet. 

""Until additional explanations on the potential measures are announced, investors will prefer to refrain from buying metals and mining stocks,"" Raiffeisen said.

USD/TRY surged 15.02% to 6.3488, not far from an all-time high of 6.6170 earlier in the session.
The Russian ruble was also weaker, with USD/RUB rising 0.85% to 67.2560, its lowest level since March 2016, after the U.S. imposed fresh sanctions against the Kremlin for its alleged part in poisoning a former British spy and his daughter in the U.K.
The dollar was lower against the safe-haven yen, with USD/JPY decreasing 0.27% to 110.77. In times of uncertainty, investors tend to invest in the Japanese yen, which is considered a safe asset during periods of risk aversion.

In other words, traders are betting the greenback’s bull run will continue, even after rising about 6 percent since March.
The mayhem in the Turkish lira spurring a global sell-off, from emerging-market currencies to European bank stocks, comes as trade tensions intensify while America’s economy powers ahead -- developments that have boosted the U.S. exchange rate.
“The dollar marches on, as the currency looks to be ‘winning’ the trade and sanctions wars, even though time will tell whether this will be a pyrrhic victory,” Stefan Koopman, a market economist at Rabobank in Utrecht, the Netherlands, said in a note Friday.
Weekly U.S. jobless claims published on Thursday fell, staying close to historic lows. Core producer prices rose 0.3 percent in July.
The PPI data suggest that “pipeline inflation pressures are building even without the assistance of tariffs,” Koopman said. “Both figures will only give yet another boost to the Fed’s confidence” over its tightening trajectory.

606,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs sees orderly Brexit with PM May getting deal through parliament,"By Guy Faulconbridge and Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) sees Prime Minister Theresa May clinching a Brexit deal on access to European Union markets for goods and getting it approved by the British parliament, though it cautioned that a disorderly exit and national election remained possible.
With less than eight months left until Britain is due to leave the EU, there is little clarity about how trade will flow as May, who is grappling with a rebellion in her party, is still trying to strike a deal with the bloc.
Under the current timetable, London and Brussels hope to get a final deal in October to give enough time to ratify it by exit day, though May's minority government faces a series of make-or-break moments in the Brexit process over coming months.
""Our own base case is for an orderly withdrawal, although the tail risks have admittedly increased,"" Goldman said in a research notes for clients. ""We see the UK and EU settling on a free trade deal covering goods but excluding most services.""
Ultimately, Goldman said, May will probably be able to get such a Brexit deal through the British parliament in December.
""While there may be no clear majority in parliament for any specific Brexit proposal, there is a majority to avoid the no deal outcome,"" it said.
It forecast the pound would rise to $1.36 in a year with the euro at 0.92 pence in a year. Sterling is currently trading at $1.27, and at 89.9 pence per euro.
Both opponents and supporters of Brexit agree that the divorce is Britain's most significant geopolitical move since World War Two, though they cast vastly different futures for the $2.9 trillion UK economy and the world's biggest trading bloc.
Opponents say it is folly that will diminish Britain's standing in the world, cost hundreds of billions of dollars in lost growth over the decades ahead and delay much needed reforms.
Supporters of Brexit say there may be some short-term pain for the economy, but that long-term it will prosper when cut free from the EU, which some of them cast as a failing German-dominated experiment in European integration.
But if May does not get the deal approved, then Britain could face a national election and the prospect of a Labour government, a scenario that could lead to extending Brexit negotiations or even stopping Brexit altogether, Goldman said.
""Although UK political dynamics have raised the likelihood of a no-deal scenario, we continue to believe it is relatively low,"" Goldman said. 
There is deep concern in boardrooms about the prospect of Britain leaving the bloc without a deal, or with a deal that would silt up the arteries of trade.
Goldman said its base case saw UK growth and inflation justifying further gradual Bank of England interest rate hikes.
It said gilts would rally if there were a 'no deal' Brexit. 
""A 'no-deal' Brexit would be a risk-off event for global markets, causing Gilts to rally,"" Goldman said.

""While the Labour government would be unlikely to reverse course on Brexit, the combination of its softer position on Brexit and its domestic policy agenda would likely imply higher long-term yields.""

The lira fell to new lows against the dollar after a meeting between Turkish and U.S. officials lead to no solution over the detention of a U.S. pastor in Turkey.
USD/TRY surged 7.81% to 5.9783 as of 4:35 AM ET (8:35 GMT) not far from an all time high of 6.1428 earlier in the session.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan brushed off concerns on Thursday, saying it was just a campaign against Turkey.
“Don’t forget, if they have their dollars, we have our people, our God. We are working hard. Look at what we were 16 years ago and look at us now,” he said to supporters in the Black Sea province of Rize.
Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak is expected to reveal plans for Turkey’s economy on Friday, but concern over Erdogan’s authoritarianism and the Turkish economy have weighed on investors.
The Russian ruble was also weaker, with USD/RUB rising 0.29% to 66.8808, its lowest level since November 2016, after the U.S. imposed fresh sanctions against the Kremlin for its alleged part in poisoning a former British spy and his daughter in the UK.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a 13-month high against a basket of currencies on Friday and the yen also made big strides, with investor appetite for risk dropping amid escalating global trade tensions and diplomatic wrangling.
The euro fell to its weakest since July 2017, while the pound dropped to its lowest in a year amid speculation Britain will leave the European Union without an agreement regarding its future relationship with Brussels.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback's strength against a group of six major currencies, climbed more than 0.6 percent to 96.103, its highest since July 2017.
The greenback has been boosted by growing global trade tensions and strained geopolitical relationships, with the United States this week saying it would impose fresh sanctions on Moscow. Washington is also embroiled in a diplomatic feud with Turkey.
Russia would consider it an economic war if the United States imposed a ban on banks or a particular currency, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday, the TASS state news agency said.
""There are all sorts of uncertainties and concerns in the markets currently, with the U.S.-China spat a well established one, but concerns over the European Union, Britain and Turkey also in the air,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, branch manager for State Street Bank and Trust in Tokyo.
""And amidst all this, the yen is suddenly back in vogue as a safe-haven. The dollar and yen are serving as safe-havens at the same time.""
With the dollar seen to be absorbing safe-haven flows, the yen's gains against the greenback were limited. The Japanese currency, however, rallied against other peers such as the euro, pound and Australian dollar.
The euro was down 0.75 percent at 127.13 yen (EURJPY=), the pound lost 0.25 percent to 142.03 yen (GBPJPY=) and the Aussie shed 0.85 percent to 81.29 yen (AUDJPY=).
The Turkish lira  hit an all-time low of 6.49 on Friday after a meeting the day before between a Turkish delegation and U.S. officials in Washington yielded no apparent solution to a diplomatic rift over the detention in Turkey of a U.S. pastor.
""Even in the unlikely event that Turkey resolves its diplomatic row with the United States, downside concerns towards the lira won't ease,"" said Takahiko Sasaki, market economist at Mizuho Bank. 
Turkey is saddled with a mountain of short-term external debt, a high current account deficit and accelerating inflation, Sasaki said.
Meanwhile, the pound has slumped 1.55 percent this week amid worries about a so-called 'hard' Brexit.
Sterling fell roughly 0.2 percent $1.2830  on Friday, plumbing a fresh one-year low of $1.2798.
The euro dropped 0.6 percent to $1.1438 (EUR=), its weakest since July 2017.
The single currency had already suffered deep losses overnight, its decline accelerating after the European Central Bank said that risks to global growth are increasing as the risk of protectionism and the threat of higher U.S. tariffs sap confidence. 
The euro was down almost 1 percent for the week, dogged by renewed investor concerns that Italy was heading for a costly and unsustainable spending spree.
The dollar dipped 0.1 percent to 110.98 yen , nudged off a session-high of 111.165. The pair has been caught in a relatively narrow 111.53-110.68 band this week.
The U.S. consumer price inflation (CPI) report for July is expected to show inflation likely increased 0.2 percent, after rising 0.1 percent in June.
The United States and Japan on Thursday began what the two sides call ""free, fair and reciprocal"" negotiations on trade, with the discussions due to continue on Friday. 
ROUBLE WOES
The rouble  retreated overnight to its lowest since November 2016, weakening beyond the psychologically important 65-per-dollar threshold.
The Chinese yuan weakened about 0.55 percent to 6.855 against the dollar in spot trading , handing back the previous day's gains. 
The yuan has slipped about 0.4 percent this week, weighed down as the market remained bearish on the near-term outlook for the currency amid the trade war between Washington and Beijing.
Elsewhere, the New Zealand dollar remained on the back foot, stretching its overnight slide to $0.6586 , its lowest since March 2016.

The kiwi lost 2 percent on Thursday after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand surprised the market by committing to holding rates at record lows until the end of 2020.

The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims dropped by 6,000 to a seasonally-adjusted 213,000 for the week ended Aug. 3, beating economists’ forecast for a rise to 220,000.
The Labor Department said on Wednesday its producer price index for final demand was flat last month after rising 0.3% in June. In the 12 months through August, the PPI rose 3.3%, compared with expectations for a 3.4% rise.
Analysts downplayed the weaker-than-expected data and blamed the slowdown in wholesale prices on the volatile trade services component.
The trade-services component did most of the damage, which was a story of softness in fuels, lubricants and machinery, RBC said.
""If we strip out trade services from core, it would have been up 0.3%,"" the bank added.
The dollar remained supported, however, on expectations that U.S. would fare better in a trade war than China as the U.S. economy is less dependent on exports.
“You have rising income, rising labor participation, rising confidence, and all of that consumer spending accounts for two thirds of our (U.S.) GDP,” said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in New York last week. “Our starting position is much stronger than the Chinese because trade doesn’t matter as much to the American economy.”
The dollar was also supported by slump in the euro and weakness in the pound.
EUR/USD fell 0.44% to $1.1559. while GBP/USD fell 0.23% to $1.2851 as fears of a no-deal Brexit continued to weigh.
USD/CAD rose 0.22% to C$1.3051 while USD/JPY fell 0.05% to Y110.98."

Investors who had been building long positions in the currency earlier in the summer rushed for the exit, causing a two-day plunge of as much as 5.1 percent. Analysts at Citibank said it looks like traders are already pricing in a worst-case scenario of sanctions on banks and new sovereign debt.
“Now we may have the problem that people will cut at the same time using a very small window,” said Koon Chow, a strategist at Union Bancaire Privee in London. “The market should have already adjusted yesterday but the risk is that there could still be follow-through as people have simply been unable to get out.”
The sanctions announced late Wednesday and taking effect this month will limit exports to Russia of U.S. goods and technology considered sensitive on national security grounds, according to a State Department official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. The restrictions, which aim to punish Russia for a nerve-agent attack in the U.K., may be followed by a round of more sweeping penalties later this year, they said.
The currency’s decline on Wednesday appeared to begin after Russian media published the full text of a separate bill introduced in Washington last week that seeks “crushing sanctions” for election meddling.
Friendly Skies?
Russia’s largest air carrier, Aeroflot PJSC, plunged to an almost two-year low on concern that the next set of sanctions could include a measure that would suspend flights to the U.S.
Sovereign ruble bond yields rose to the highest since 2016 and the cost of insuring dollar debt against default through credit-default swaps jumped to 154 basis points, the highest in a year. Moves were exacerbated by a drop in oil prices this week.
The two-day rout has reignited the kind of concerns that swept the market in April after the U.S. introduced penalties against a raft of billionaires and their assets. Now as then, investors are starting to question how far lawmakers in Washington will be prepared to go in their bid to punish Russia over its foreign-policy moves and claims it meddled in U.S. elections.
The U.S. has been imposing sanctions on Russia since the invasion of Crimea in 2014. To date, most of the measures target specific individuals or industries without having much broader market impact, but there are also measures which bar certain Russian companies from issuing new stock and bonds. The fallout from a move to target sovereign debt or the banking sector would be much wider and the Treasury has warned against going down that route.
“It’s hard to tell the extent of the sell-off,” said Viktor Szabo, a money manager at Aberdeen Standard in London. “The question is whether these sanctions will reach key energy and financial names and also the sovereign.”

USD/TRY was up 2.50% at 5.4122 by 4:42 AM ET (8:42 GMT), hovering just below an earlier record high of 5.4486.
A Turkish delegation went to Washington on Wednesday to try and resolve disputes between the two nations. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Turkey over the continued detention of American evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson for terrorism charges while his trial continues in western Turkey.
The U.S. Treasury implemented sanctions on Turkish ministers of justice and interior, with Washington branding the detention as “unfair and unjust”.
Little progress was made at Wednesday’s meeting according to a Reuters report.
“We held additional talks with Turkish officials. The conversations continue,” state department spokesperson Heather Nauert said.
Thursday’s decline occurred amid sharp losses in other emerging market currencies.
Of note, the Russian rouble extended sharp losses seen on Wednesday when the U.S. announced that would impose fresh sanctions on Russia after Washington determined Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian double agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, in Britain.
Russia's embassy in the U.S. said Thursday that the accusations were far-fetched and called the new sanctions draconian.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Japanese yen rose broadly on Thursday in an apparent reflection of concern among investors about an uptick in geopolitic tensions from the U.S.-China trade war to Brexit. 
Global foreign exchange markets this summer have been dominated by political angst from U.S. sanctions on Russia and Turkey to rising tensions in the Middle East and in Europe.
The Russian rouble  retreated to its lowest since November 2016 overnight, weakening beyond the psychologically important 65 per dollar threshold, after Washington said it would impose fresh sanctions on Moscow.
The Turkish lira touched a fresh record low against the dollar, weakening some 2.5 percent from Wednesday's close after a Turkish delegation met U.S. officials to try to resolve disputes between the two NATO allies.
""Politics continues to wreak short-term havoc in global FX markets – and to the extent where we’re questioning whether any currency is truly safe,"" said Viraj Patel, a currency strategist at Dutch bank ING.
Markets remain worried by the global trade conflict but traders are focusing on talks in Washington on Thursday in which Japan will seek to avert tariffs on its car exports and fend off U.S. demands for a bilateral free trade agreement.
This year's global trade row has seen the dollar strengthen and the Chinese yuan tumble while the safe haven yen has stayed resolutely weak, falling about four percent against the dollar over the past six months.
That has prompted speculation that the currency's depreciation could be an issue in Thursday's talks as Donald Trump has voiced concerns over countries deliberately weakening their currencies- ignoring a custom that U.S. presidents avoid openly interfering in financial markets.
The yen on Thursday rose to a ten-day high against the dollar of 110.76 and strengthened against the euro.  (EURJPY=D3)
The currency was lifted on Wednesday after reports that Bank of Japan board members had disagreed on how far interest rates should be allowed to move from the central bank's target.
""The yen-buying trend has been gathering pace since early August and the moves generated on the latest BOJ news added further momentum,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
Elsewhere, the U.S. dollar, which has been playing more of a role recently as a safe-haven, rose 0.3 percent to 95.336 on the dollar index which tracks the greenback versus a group of six currencies. (DXY)
That kept the euro in the red at $1.15765, not far from a 2018-low of $1.15080 (EUR=EBS).
The dollar had weakened after hitting a three-week high on Monday, when the prospect of a full-blown trade war increased demand for the currency. Traders on Thursday said the dollar needed a fresh impetus or an escalation in the trade tensions to move higher.
KIWI STOOPS TO 2-1/2-YEAR LOW
In a reminder the dispute has not disappeared, however, the U.S. Trade Representative's office said on Tuesday that the U.S. would begin collecting 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion of Chinese goods later this month.
Sterling on Thursday continued to slide and hit $1.2842 following a drop to $1.2854 the previous day, its lowest in a year. 
The pound is weakening sharply as investors ramp up bets on Britain leaving the European Union without an agreement with Brussels on their future relationship.
A big mover in the G10 currency sphere was the New Zealand dollar, which fell more than 1 percent at $0.6652 , its lowest since March 2016.
The kiwi tumbled after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) on Thursday unexpectedly committed to keep interest rates at record lows through to 2020 on disappointing economic activity, a dovish turn that caught markets off-guard.
RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr told Reuters in an interview that the central bank will need to make sure it is ""blowing wind into sails"" of the country's economy for some time yet.
""The reaction to the RBNZ was bigger than we expected. Pushing back the timing of the first hike from ‘far away' to ‘over the rainbow' doesn't seem like such a big deal to me but we've been bearish NZD for a while,"" said Kit Juckes, a strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in London.

(Reuters) - Investors trimmed bearish bets on most emerging Asian currencies over the last two weeks, as renewed trade war concerns were cushioned by regional central bank efforts to shore up their currencies, a Reuters poll showed. 
Central banks across the globe adopted tightening postures, with the U.S. Federal Reserve keeping its interest rates unchanged last week but likely to remain on track to increase borrowing costs in September. 
In China, investors eased their short positions on the yuan as the currency regained some strength after the country's central bank stepped up efforts to cap further weakening of the currency. 
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) last week said it will essentially make it more costly to short the yuan, helping it rebound from a near 15-month low against the greenback. 
That came after China's finance ministry unveiled new sets of additional tariffs on over 5,000 goods imported from the United States worth $60 billion.
A separate poll found that China's yuan will regain some of its recent sharp losses against the dollar and appreciate over the next year, but only if trade tensions between the Washington and Beijing subside. 
Bolstering sentiment in the region, data on Wednesday showed that July exports rose more than expected, suggesting fresh U.S. tariffs imposed last month have not yet had a significant impact on global demand for its goods.
""It's going to depend on consumer price index on Friday night in the U.S. - a benign CPI would potentially see the U.S. dollar/yuan read back over the next week or two towards 6.7,"" said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD and FX provider AxiTrader
""But if CPI is high and it increases expectations about Fed timing then I would expect the current yuan stability to prove ephemeral.""
The world's largest economy will post July inflation data on August 10. 
Investors cut bearish bets on the Indian rupee to the lowest in over three months, the Reuters poll of 11 respondents showed. 
Last week, the Reserve Bank of India raised interest rates for the second consecutive policy meeting, retaining its ""neutral"" stance, aiming to cap inflation. 
For India, inflation still remains a central concern. Rising global crude oil prices are adding to imported inflation pressures. Moreover, recent erratic Indian monsoons muddy the outlook for winter-harvested crops in a largely agriculture-reliant economy. 
The rupee, however, remains the worst performing currency in the region, having weakened nearly 7 percent so far this year. 
Bearish bets on the Indonesian rupiah were at their lowest since May 31. 
Indonesia's central bank has been the most aggressive in Asia this year, hiking its benchmark rate 100 basis points between mid-May and the end of June. 
Indonesia which has been struggling with its fragile currency said it expects headline inflation rate will be around 3.5 percent, the midpoint of it's 2.5-4.5 percent target range. 
Short positions on the Thai baht eased slightly. 
Thailand's central bank on Wednesday held its benchmark interest rate at near record lows, as expected, saying Southeast Asia's second-largest economy continues to face little inflationary pressure as growth pace improves. 
Thailand has kept policy settings unchanged since a cut in April 2015.
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.

The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

The NZD/USD pair fell 0.82% to 0.6679 by 1:13AM ET (05:13 GMT). Central Bank governor Adrian Orr said on Thursday in Washington that he is open to a rate cut if needed.
“We expect to keep the OCR at this level through 2019 and into 2020, longer than we projected in our May statement,” Orr said. “The direction of our next OCR move could be up or down.”
In addition, the central bank trimmed its forecast for economic growth in 2018 as data showed business confidence fell, while housing markets also cooled.
Risks to New Zealand exports also increased amid global trade tensions, RBNZ noted.
Meanwhile, the Chinese yuan rose 0.2% against the dollar on Thursday. An article by CNBC said the recent weakness in the Chinese currency is creating challenging headwinds for Beijing's push to promote its currency globally.
The yuan was under pressure since July amid an on-going trade dispute with the U.S., and analysts now believe its push to become a global currency is likely to suffer a setback.
""Renminbi internationalization could be slowing down temporarily in the second half of this year,"" Ken Cheung, senior Asia foreign exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong, told CNBC, citing the disruption caused by the trade war.
Separately, in a report released Tuesday, IHS Markit economists said the decline in yuan started earlier in the year as the Federal Reserve continued to raise interest rates.
""As long as there is more tension or more uncertainty around U.S. and China trade, then you can imagine the trade volume between the U.S. and China will come down,"" he said. ""And that sets back the overall renminbi internationalization in terms of the usage of renminbi as a trade settlement currency.""
The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, edged up 0.03% to 94.98 on Thursday.

LONDON (Reuters) - The likelihood Britain crashes out of the European Union without a trade deal has increased, an outcome that would hurt an already weak pound, according to economists and foreign exchange strategists polled by Reuters.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Friday Britain faces an ""uncomfortably high"" risk of leaving the EU with no deal, while on Sunday trade minister Liam Fox put the odds of such an outcome at 60-40.
But economists were far less pessimistic, giving a median 25 percent chance no agreement was reached. That was, however, higher than the 20 percent in a July poll. 
A dozen of 27 common contributors between that poll and this upped their forecast. Thirteen left them unchanged and two cut them.
""Given the talk over recent weeks the perception of no deal has increased. Fundamentally our base case is still that some kind of deal is struck. A deal is more likely than no deal,"" said James Smith at ING.
Sterling fell on Wednesday, slumping below $1.29 for the first time in almost a year, in a sell-off fueled by investor concern Britain will crash out of the EU without a trade deal. The poll was largely taken ahead of this latest fall.
However, 80 percent of economists said the most likely outcome will be the two sides agreeing on an EU-UK free trade deal, as has been predicted since Reuters first began polling on this in late 2016.
But in an upgraded second place was leaving without an agreement and trading under basic World Trade Organization rules.
Slipping to third place, according to those polled, was the scenario where Britain would belong to the European Economic Area, paying to maintain full access to the EU's single market.
Once again, their least probable scenario was a decision to reverse Brexit.
Peter Dixon at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said: ""Despite the apparent increase in the likelihood of a disorderly Brexit, it is not in the interest of either party that this should happen and as a result I hold to the opinion that the cliff edge can (and must) be avoided.""
But if that common view is wrong and the two sides part ways without a deal then sterling  would fall to $1.20, according to the median forecast given by foreign exchange strategists polled in the past week. 
Since the Brexit vote sterling is down nearly 14 percent versus the dollar. While it is unlikely to fully recoup those losses anytime soon, expectations for a deal have driven expectations for a strengthening pound.
In one month, cable will be stronger at $1.31 and then at 1.34 by end-January - just two months before Britain is due to leave the EU - the poll forecast.
By end-July next year, it suggested, sterling will have rallied to $1.38, probably supported by an expected rate hike from the Bank of England.
Last week, the nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to push British interest rates above their financial crisis lows but signaled they were in no hurry to raise them further. That unanimity came despite widespread criticism by economists that it was not necessary.
Adding 25 basis points, they took the Bank Rate to 0.75 percent. Economists polled by Reuters largely agreed the MPC would take its time, with the next hike - also of 25 basis points - not expected until the second quarter, just after Brexit.
An overwhelming majority of respondents said the Bank was likely to raise rates within the next year and similarly agreed that it was unlikely to cut rates.
The European Central Bank, which last month reaffirmed plans to end its 2.6 trillion-euro stimulus program this year, is expected to raise its interest rates in the quarter after the BoE does.[ECILT/EU]
So against the common currency the pound (EURGBP=) will move little. In one month one euro will get you 89.0 pence, in six months 88.0p and the same in a year, the poll found. It was trading around 90.0p on Wednesday.
British inflation jumped after the Brexit vote, largely driven by sterling's fall, making imports more expensive, and it is only expected to be back at the central bank's 2 percent target in the third quarter of next year.
With prices rising more sharply, and Brexit uncertainty unsettling business and consumer confidence, growth has steadily slowed. Britain's economy was predicted to grow 1.3 percent this year and then pick up to 1.5 percent next, albeit still lagging its peers.

618,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 09:20PM ET</span>",Dollar's march higher to run out of road within next six months: poll,"By Hari Kishan
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar's march higher against major currencies will run out of road within the next six months, according to a Reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists, who have held on to that view since May.
While the greenback fell about 3 percent in the first few months of the year, since mid-April the dollar index (DXY) has risen more than 6 percent, supported by investors seeking safety in U.S. assets on concerns over the impact of trade tariffs.
Those concerns are well-founded; the U.S. trade representative's office said on Tuesday it would begin collecting 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion of goods imported from China later this month, and China has vowed to retaliate to an equal degree.
The dollar fell a quarter of a percent against a basket of currencies on Tuesday, its biggest drop in a week, suggesting its fear-driven rally is showing signs of fading despite escalating trade disputes.
The latest Reuters poll of more than 60 currency analysts, taken from Aug. 3 to 8, suggested all major currencies will be higher than they are now against the dollar in six months and in a year.
A slight majority - 29 of 52 analysts - who answered an additional question said they were not confident the dollar would be able to maintain its strength over the next six months. The remaining 23 said they were either confident or very confident.
The dollar may struggle to move much higher, given that currency positioning by speculators is close to the most bullish on the dollar since January 2017, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.
There was even more clarity when asked if the dollar rally could last a year, with 37 of 52 analysts saying they were not confident, including 13 who said they were not confident at all.
""It has had a 6 or 7 percent rise in the last three months - but it is flattening out...and is showing already that there is a resistance among investors to take the dollar further up,"" said Gavin Friend, senior market strategist at NAB.
""We are not saying the dollar has peaked here. It might have a little bit of further strength to go, but by the time we get into the back-end of this year, the dollar will start to ease off again.""
China's yuan, actively managed by the Chinese authorities but which has taken the biggest hit from the ongoing trade wrangling, is now expected to cut some of its losses against the dollar and appreciate over the coming year. [CNY/POLL]
The yuan held firm near a one-week high versus the dollar on Wednesday, extending its rise after the central bank took some steps to curb the currency's decline.
The market has already fully priced in most of the factors which have aided the dollar rally, including the threat of a full-blown trade war, robust economic performance and interest rate differentials. So any further gains in the currency will be limited.
While better-than-expected economic performance in the United States and higher interest rates there than elsewhere could still benefit the dollar, a separate Reuters poll showed U.S. economic growth likely peaked in the second quarter. [ECILT/US]
Economists who had accurately forecast the U.S. economy to expand 4.1 percent in the quarter just ended said that may be the peak for the world's largest economy. 
""The dollar has been winning so far because of two things - one is this trade war...and the other is that the Federal Reserve is the only central bank out there which is tightening in a sustained way,"" said Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING Bank.
""Unless we get even stronger growth in the third quarter, which the data so far hasn't suggested - and if that is the case then it is hard to price-in another level of dollar strength.""
Interest rate differentials may also stop widening soon as the Fed is largely expected to stay on its current path and the European Central Bank has said it will wind down its massive stimulus program by end-2018. It is then predicted to raise rates around this time next year.
The euro (EUR=), which is down over 3 percent this year so far, is forecast to regain most of those losses to $1.19 in six months from around $1.16, where it was trading on Wednesday. It is then forecast to rise to $1.23 in a year, unchanged from July's poll.
Median expectations for the single currency had fallen from the prior poll for three straight months until this survey.

619,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 08:20PM ET</span>",Chinese yuan to regain some ground if trade tensions ease: poll,"By Vivek Mishra
BENGALURU (Reuters) - China's yuan will regain some of its recent sharp losses against the dollar and appreciate over the next year, but only if trade tensions between the Washington and Beijing subside, a Reuters poll found on Thursday.
The yuan  has weakened almost 5 percent so far this year and hit a 14-month low last week, primarily driven by new tariff threats from the U.S. and retaliatory warnings from Chinese authorities.
Also, by consistently lowering the mid-point reference rate, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) has allowed the currency to weaken substantially, adding to anxiety in global financial markets.
""We believe the yuan may potentially strengthen against the dollar if the current triggers are removed. Indeed, if U.S. President Donald Trump takes a step back from imposing further tariffs, this may help reverse some of the market concerns about USDCNY,"" said Jeff Ng, Asia chief economist at Continuum Economics.
""Further, a rebound in domestic economic metrics could also help tilt the PBoC away from accommodation, keeping USDCNY closer to the 6.50-level. The yuan could also be granted a reprieve if markets expect the Federal Reserve to slow its pace of rate increases or start to worry about the U.S.' current account deficit.""
The yuan  was expected to gain around 2 percent to 6.70 per dollar in a year, according to the poll of more than 60 foreign exchange strategists taken August 6-8. It was trading around 6.82 on Wednesday.
After largely standing aside in recent weeks while the yuan fell, there are signs that Chinese authorities are now looking to put a floor under the currency and discourage bets on further losses that could trigger capital outflows.
On Friday, the central bank said it would require banks to keep reserves equivalent to 20 percent of their clients' foreign exchange forwards positions in a move to stabilize the yuan.
Still, the 12-month forecast for the yuan was the most pessimistic median in Reuters polls conducted this year. 
According to a separate Reuters poll on currency positioning, investors piled bearish bets on the yuan to the highest on record amid the escalating tit-for-tat trade battle between the world's two biggest economies. [ASIA/FXP]
Beijing on Friday announced tariffs on an additional $60 billion a year worth of imports from the U.S.
China's retaliatory measures come after the latest U.S. proposal to increase tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese products.
Though data on Wednesday showed China's exports are holding up surprising well so far, it is early days and the trade battle is expected to put further pressure on its already slowing economy. Growth is forecast to slow to 6.6 percent in 2018, and 6.3 percent in 2019, from 6.9 percent last year, a separate Reuters poll found.[ECILT/CN]
""The rising likelihood of an economic war with the U.S. presents the biggest threat to China's growth and financial stability since the global financial crisis,"" noted Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based senior emerging market strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) CIB.
""We believe Beijing has more to lose in a confrontation and so it is in China's interests to reach a compromise with Washington rather than going down the path of retaliation. While some battles are likely to be fought, a war will probably be avoided, allowing China to limit the growth slowdown fairly easily via relatively modest credit, monetary and fiscal easing.""
Still, there are few signs that either side is in the mood for concessions at this point, and a few currency strategists expect the yuan to depreciate further over the coming 12 months.
Thirteen of 64 participants said the yuan will weaken below 7.0 per dollar in a year, a closely watched level that has not been breached since the 2008 global financial crisis.
""It is an under-statement to say the near-term outlook for the yuan remains highly uncertain. In the event that trade tensions escalate further, 6.95–7.00 could be the ultimate top for USD/CNY,"" noted Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ.
""Such a move would entail a 10 percent depreciation of the CNY, matching the 10 percent tariff which the U.S. threatens to impose on $200 billion of imports from China.""

But Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) told clients in a note that it believes an eventual ""deal"" still seems to be a reasonable base case assumption. It expected the currency to touch 6.60 in 12 months.

“While not our base case scenario, we cannot rule out a turn toward a more interventionist currency policy, particularly since the current administration has, at times, hinted at a preference for dollar weakness or objected to perceived Chinese currency manipulation,” Michael Feroli, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s chief U.S. economist, said in a research note this week.
In a Twitter flurry last month, Trump accused China and the euro area of manipulating their currencies, and complained that a rising dollar is blunting America’s “competitive edge.” In a reference to interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, the president said “tightening now hurts all that we have done.”
The U.S. hasn’t intervened in markets to sell the dollar since 2000 when it united with fellow members of the Group of Seven in an effort to boost the sliding euro. It last bought greenbacks in 2011 as part of an international bid to stop the yen from surging after an earthquake and tsunami in Japan led locals to repatriate cash.
But analysts are awakening to the reality that Trump may follow through on his jawboning, with potential implications for the independence of the Fed.
“We believe the Fed would fall in line and play their usual role of following Treasury’s lead on dollar policy,” Feroli said. However, he noted that currency intervention would likely have no effect on monetary policy, since the central bank would likely “sterilize” the transactions by purchasing an offsetting amount of U.S. securities at home, thus leaving the monetary base unchanged.
Any attempt to massage the dollar’s value in markets would risk undermining Trump’s argument last month that China has been manipulating its currency. The U.S. has long championed a Group of 20 pact that member economies will “refrain from competitive devaluations, and will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes.”
If China takes the lead in a currency war, letting the value of the yuan fall, it could have a deflationary impact around the world, since a stronger dollar would tighten global liquidity, Oxford Economics said in a note this week.
For now, the People’s Bank of China is suggesting it won’t support a steep drop in the yuan, with the central bank intervening last week to support the currency, after it slid to its lowest level in more than a year."

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.01% to 95.01.
The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said it will impose a 25% charge on $16 billion worth of U.S. goods. The 333 goods targeted by China would include vehicles, crude oil and fiber optical cables.
The announcement from China comes after the Trump administration followed through with a 25% tariff on an additional $16 billion of Chinese goods Tuesday evening.
The latest volley of American and Chinese tariffs takes the total of targeted goods to $50 billion on each side and are slated to come into effect on Aug. 23.
That propped up demand for safe-haven yen and the Swiss franc against the greenback.
USD/JPY fell 0.37% to Y110.98, while USD/CHF fell 0.09% to 0.9946.
A slump in the pound to its lowest level in a year, amid fears of a no-deal Brexit, and renewed pressure on the yuan steadied the dollar.
GBP/USD fell 0.46% to $1.2880, while USD/CNH gained 0.18% to 6.8328.
The plunge in pound comes after U.K. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said it was more likely than not that Brexit happened without a trade deal. The odds of Britain not securing a trade deal before leaving the EU were ""certainly not much more than 60-40,"" Fox said.

GBP/USD hit a low of 1.2854 and was at 1.2869 by 10:39 AM ET (14:39 GMT), off 0.53% for the day.
Sterling hit a 10-month low against the euro, with EUR/GBP advancing 0.48% to 0.9030.
Sentiment on the pound has soured after Britain’s International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said in an interview published in the Sunday Times newspaper there was a 60:40 chance that the UK would leave the European Union without an agreement.
The remarks came after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned late last week that there is an “uncomfortably high” risk of a no-deal Brexit.
Meanwhile, the dollar edged higher against a currency basket as fears over global trade tensions returned to the fore.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, inched up 0.11% to 95.10 after slipping 0.2% on Tuesday.
The index touched the highest level in nearly a year last week, bolstered by rising U.S. interest rates and fears over the impact of trade conflicts.
Trade tensions escalated after China announced that it will impose retaliatory 25% tariffs on $16 billion of U.S. imports.
China’s commerce ministry said it was forced to retaliate after the Trump administration said Tuesday that it will impose 25% tariffs on another $16 billion of goods it imports from China later this month.
The move is the latest by Washington to pressure China into negotiating trade concessions after it imposed tariffs on $34 billion of goods in July.
China’s yuan slid against the dollar, with the currency, which is usually closely controlled by Beijing, at 6.8332 in offshore trading.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The rouble slid towards its lowest level in nearly two years on Wednesday and investors sold off bonds and stocks after the Kommersant daily published what it said was the full text of a draft U.S. law detailing possible penalties against Russia.
Republican and Democratic U.S. senators introduced the draft legislation last week, the latest effort by lawmakers to punish Moscow for its alleged interference in U.S. elections and its activities in Syria and Ukraine.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the measure's lead sponsors, called it ""the sanctions bill from hell."" 
Russian market reaction was muted at the time, however, and jitters only set in on Wednesday after Kommersant's publication of the sanctions document https://www.kommersant.ru/docs/2018/_2018d140-Menendez-Russia-Sanctions-Bill.pdf which cited potential curbs on the operations of several state-owned Russian banks in the United States and restrictions on holding Russian sovereign debt. 
The rouble weakened beyond the psychological thresholds of 65 versus the dollar and 75 against the euro, briefly touching levels against the dollar last seen in April and within a few kopecks of a low last seen in November 2016. 
""The rouble is hit by the sanctions theme. Even though there will be no real action until September, the signal is already there,"" a dealer at a major Western bank in Moscow said.
As of 1255 GMT, the rouble was 2.2 percent weaker at 64.90  against the dollar. Versus the euro, the rouble was 2.1 percent weaker at 75.18 . 
Russia's five-year credit default swaps (CDS), which reflect the cost of insuring Russian debt against default, rose to their late June high of 145, up from 133-134 earlier this week .
""There are a lot of geopolitical concerns investors have and that's being reflected in a higher risk premium on Russian assets,"" said Phoenix Kalen, director of emerging markets strategy, at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in London.
""The probabilities are such that this bill is still relatively unlikely to become law and with that assumption in mind then I wouldn't expect the rouble to sell off significantly from here,"" Kalen added. 
The U.S. measure's prospects are unclear. It would have to pass both the Senate and House of Representatives and be signed into law by President Donald Trump. 
""But even so, the document clearly shows the determination to go further than before in order to cause damage for Russia,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said in a note.
The jitters also sparked a sell-off in Russian treasury bonds, known as OFZs, sending their prices lower and lifting their yields. Yields in 10-year OFZ bonds jumped to 8.12 percent, their highest since mid-March 2017 (RU10YT=RR).
""The sanctions story will be one that resurfaces from time to time, especially with Republicans trying to figure out how to position themselves ahead of the mid-term elections in contrast to President Trump’s position, so it is likely that we will see these bursts of pressure on Russian assets,"" said Societe Generale's Kalen.
STOCKS BATTERED
Shares in Russia's largest lender Sberbank (MM:SBER) dropped to 192.50 roubles on the Kommersant report, losing more than 4 percent on the day and hovering at their lowest since mid-April.
Shares in Russia's second-largest bank VTB (MM:VTBR) were also down - by 2.1 percent - underperforming the benchmark stock index MOEX which declined 0.9 percent to 2,290.5 (IMOEX).
Russian business conglomerate Sistema (MM:AFKS) saw its shares tumble by 3.6 percent, hit by the threat of targeted sanctions after Republican Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen said on her Twitter account on Tuesday that an investigation was underway into Sistema's chairman Vladimir Yevtushenkov for ""operations in illegally annexed Crimea.""

Sistema's spokesman said the company had no investments in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

624,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Ruble Heads Toward 20-Month Low as Sanctions Bill Jolts Russia,"(Bloomberg) -- The ruble headed for its weakest closing level since November 2016 and Russian stocks and bonds plunged after local media published the full text of a U.S. bill seeking “crushing sanctions” for election meddling.
The currency slid 2.2 percent to 64.91 per dollar on Wednesday, sinking the most among major peers and breaking out of a range it’s traded in since April, after Russia’s Kommersant newspaper posted the draft introduced last week by a bipartisan group of legislators. The bill includes proposals to sanction new sovereign debt and block dollar transactions of the nation’s biggest lenders.
“The Kommersant publication was the straw that broke the camel’s back,” said Denis Davydov, an analyst at Nordea Bank in Moscow. “It’s important to be able to read and assess the actual bill.”
No action will be taken on the draft until the House is back from summer recess in September, leaving room for more market jitters through the end of the month. But with President Donald Trump calling for closer ties with Russia, and the U.S. Treasury warning earlier this year against sanctioning the sovereign debt market, it’s uncertain the bill will make it into law.
Traders are particularly concerned by a clause that calls for prohibiting “all transactions in all property and interests in property” of some of the country’s largest lenders. Sberbank, VTB Bank, Gazprombank, Promsvyazbank, Rosselkhozbank and Vnesheconombank are listed. The draft also includes Bank of Moscow, which was merged into VTB in 2016, while Vnesheconombank is listed twice in the text, without explanation.
Subtle Sanctions
Shamaila Khan, who holds Russian bonds as a director of emerging-market debt at AllianceBernstein in New York, is preparing for further sanctions in the “foreseeable future,” but thinks the penalties will be much subtler than the sweeping measures outlined in the lawmakers latest bill. The measures will most likely be directed at individuals or companies, she said.
“If you start crushing Russia by causing the banking system to collapse as a result of sanctions, it could actually lead to worse political outcomes than what you have right now,” Khan said. “The key rule of sanctions is that you want to keep some in reserve because if you use your worst sanctions then what do you follow it up with?”
Vote Hacking
The bill also seeks penalties on energy projects and a survey of President Vladimir Putin’s net worth. It follows reports of Russia’s ongoing efforts to sway U.S. elections, new efforts to hack U.S. senators, and intelligence agencies’ conclusion that Russia sought to meddle in the 2016 presidential election.
Lawmakers from both parties have also been sharply critical of President Donald Trump’s meeting with Putin in Helsinki last month, saying Trump hasn’t done enough to hold Russia accountable.
Investors learned their lesson not to take the threat of U.S. sanctions lightly after penalties introduced in April against a raft of billionaires and their assets sent markets into a nosedive. The Treasury has softened its position since then by outlining a path to lift curbs on companies controlled by Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska.
The Russian government only managed to sell half the amount planned in a bond auction on Wednesday as borrowing costs jumped to the highest level in more than a year. The cost of insuring dollar debt against default through credit-default swaps jumped to a two-month high of 149 basis points. Banking stocks were the biggest drag on the benchmark stock index, which slid 1 percent.
“If the bill becomes law and Russia replies, the ruble would be hit even harder through deteriorating sentiment and a sell-off of Russian assets,” said Vladimir Miklashevsky, a strategist at Danske Bank A/S in Helsinki.

625,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 09:11AM ET</span>",Sterling plunges to 2018 lows as Brexit unease builds,"By Tom Finn and Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - The pound was engulfed in a heavy selloff on Wednesday, skidding to its lowest levels against the dollar and euro in almost a year as markets ramped up bets on Britain leaving the EU without an agreement with Brussels.
London-based traders reported a significant increase in investor hedging against a possible freefall in sterling in the event of a 'no-deal' Brexit, which could damage the economy by raising trade barriers with the UK's biggest export market. 
The exodus began after UK trade minister Liam Fox said on Sunday there was up to a 60 percent chance the country could leave the European Union next March without any new trade deals in place. The currency move has snowballed since.
There was no obvious trigger for Wednesday's big moves lower, but rather a building sense of investor anxiety as the clock ticks down towards a series of EU-Britain meetings starting in September with no agreement in sight. 
""What we are seeing is broad sterling weakness, a very aggressive weakening trend,"" said Peter Kinsella, strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
Sterling tumbled against the euro (EURGBP=D3), dollar  yen (GBPJPY=D3) and Swiss franc (GBPCHF=D3). 
The slide against the euro, the biggest one-day fall since end-May, left the pound below 90 pence for the first time in nine months.
Three-month sterling implied volatility, a gauge of expected swings in a currency, surged to its highest since March . The vol, as the measure is known, was headed for its biggest one-day jump since November.
Part of the hedging trade was being driven by companies.
""A lot of companies can't wait for the (Brexit) negotiations outcome in October, so of course are trying to hedge against a drop in the pound,"" said Christophe Barraud, an economist at Paris-based brokerage Market Securities.
Sterling slumped 0.6 percent versus the euro to 90.175 pence. The pound fell to as low as $1.2859 against the dollar.
NO RATES RESCUE
Analysts said the pound was also being hit by a growing realization that, after last week's Bank of England's policy meeting, UK interest rate increases were likely to be as limited as one a year and contingent on a smooth Brexit.
The BoE raised rates from crisis-era lows last week, but few investors saw the increase as a vote of confidence in the economy with so much political uncertainty ahead. 
""Some are thinking in the market that the BoE raised in order to given them ammunition to cut rates in the face of a 'no deal',"" said Neil Jones, head of hedge fund FX sales at Mizuho Bank. ""The next move could be a cut rather than another hike.""
Options markets supported the idea that there would be little relief in the coming months for sterling.
Risk reversals - used commonly to hedge against expected currency moves - in sterling/dollar fell to their lowest since early March 2017. That indicates a sharp rise in demand for sterling ""puts"", or options to sell the currency.
""BREXIT MESS""
British Prime Minister Theresa May will discuss Brexit with the EU's 27 other leaders at an informal summit in Austria next month and meet with them again in October to try to seal deals on the terms of Britain's withdrawal.
""We remain bearish on the pound in the short term until the Brexit mess is out the way,"" said Nomura strategist Jordan Rochester, predicting a range of $1.27-$1.28 before September.
The pound has fallen 10.6 percent since mid-April versus the greenback and is down almost 5 percent year-to-date.
Traders are also preparing for Friday's reading of second-quarter British economic growth numbers, which might offer some relief.

There was a silver lining on Wednesday for equities, with Britain's export-heavy FTSE 100 equity index (FTSE) surging 0.8 percent. The more domestically oriented FTSE 250 index <.FTMC< rose 0.4 percent.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro hovered around the $1.16 mark on Wednesday but failed to capitalise on a pause in the dollar's rally, while solid data out of China calmed nerves about recent Sino-U.S. trade tensions. 
The dollar has weakened since hitting a three-week high on Monday, when the prospect of a full-blown trade war increased demand for the currency. Traders said the dollar needed a fresh impetus or an escalation in the trade tensions to move higher. 
""The Chinese trade data, coupled with the PBOC moves, is helping quieten markets, with range-bound trading,"" said Valentin Marinov, an FX strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR). ""The main driver for markets at the moment is dollar buying and selling."" 
The People's Bank of China announced last week that it would impose a reserve requirement on forex forwards and wanted to see a stable yuan.
China's currency has since recovered some of its losses but was 0.2 weaker at 6.8380  in offshore markets, still off last week's 6.9125 lows.
The euro initially rose 0.2 percent to $1.1618 (EUR=EBS), against Monday's low of $1.1530 but could not hold its gains.
The dollar index fell 0.2 percent to 95.036 (DXY) before trimming its losses.
""The USD appears increasingly vulnerable as recent movements in global bond markets erode the USD's fundamental support via narrowing interest rate differentials. Sentiment is likely to remain dominant, however, and markets remain vulnerable to headline risk and President Trump’s twitter feed,"" said Christophe Barraud at Paris-based Market Securities.
Traders say market sensitivity to trade war headlines has diminished and investors will want to see evidence the dispute is having real impact before they panic.
China's July trade data, the first since the United States imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports on July 6, showed a faster-than-expected rise in China's exports and imports. The country's trade surplus with the United States was little changed.
In a reminder the dispute has not disappeared, however, the U.S. Trade Representative's office said on Tuesday that the U.S. would begin collecting 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion of Chinese goods later this month.
The yen rose half a percent after reports that Bank of Japan board members had disagreed on how far interest rates should be allowed to move from the central bank's target. The yen rose to 110.84, a one-week high .
The Australian dollar, seen as a proxy for China risk, slipped 0.1 percent to $0.7413 .
Britain's pound skidded further as worries about Brexit weighed. It slipped below $1.29  and hit a nine-month low of 89.92 pence (EURGBP=D3) against the euro.

In emerging markets the weaker dollar offered no respite to Turkey's lira, which dropped another 1.4 percent  on renewed concerns about the government's handling of the economy.

Cable’s strength occurred on Wednesday despite little movement seen in the dollar against major rivals.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was little changed at 95.03.
Investors had been investing in the dollar as a safe haven asset while trade tensions between China and the U.S. continued to mount.

The move is the latest by Washington to pressure China into negotiating trade concessions after it imposed tariffs on $34 billion of goods in July, prompting pledges from China to retaliate.
However, analysts pointed to China’s strong trade data released early on Tuesday, suggesting the world’s second largest economy had yet to be derailed by the tit-for-tat.
Chinese exports jumped 12.2% in July, while imports surged 27.3%, beating expectations and providing some calm despite the fact the first round of U.S. tariffs were implemented last month.
Contrary to its trade against the pound, the dollar was weaker against the yen, with USD/JPY losing 0.42% to trade at 110.92 ahead of expected bilateral trade talks between the U.S. and Japan in Washington on Thursday."

ANKARA/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's lira weakened against the dollar on Wednesday, hit by concern about President Tayyip Erdogan's grip on monetary policy and reports that efforts to resolve a diplomatic row had yet to make tangible progress.
A Turkish delegation is visiting Washington this week to discuss the friction between the NATO allies, according to reports on Tuesday. But the United States said the two remained at odds on its core demand that Ankara free American evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson.
Those tensions have heightened investor concern over Turkey, where investors are most worried by what they see as Erdogan's influence over the central bank, which has not been as aggressive in raising interest rates as investors have hoped. 
The president, a self-described ""enemy of interest rates"", wants to see borrowing costs lowered to fuel credit, new construction and growth. The appointment of his son-in-law as finance minister has deepened the concern.
""The central bank is behind the curve; it remains behind the curve,"" said Guillaume Tresca, senior emerging market strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR). ""The lira keeps depreciating and we are seeing that the central bank is not ready to act.""
The lira  stood at 5.2925 against the dollar, more than 1 percent weaker on the day. It had gained on Tuesday on reports the delegation would visit Washington.
The currency has fallen some 27 percent this year and plunged as much as 5.5 percent on Monday to 5.4250 per dollar, an all-time low and its biggest intraday drop in nearly a decade. That decline came after Washington said it was reviewing access to the U.S. market for Turkey's exports.
The cost of insuring exposure to Turkish bank debt rose on Wednesday, with five-year credit default swaps (CDS) for Yapi Kredi up 1 basis point (bp) from Tuesday's close to 460 bps, according to IHS Markit, a record high. 
Relations between Turkey and the United States have been strained by differences over Syria and by the trial in Turkey of Brunson, the pastor, for supporting a group Ankara blames for a 2016 abortive putsch. Brunson denies the charge. The United States is also seeking the release from detention of three locally employed embassy staff.

Washington last week imposed sanctions on President Tayyip Erdogan's justice minister and interior ministers, saying they played leading roles in organizations responsible for Brunson's arrest. Erdogan has said Turkey would retaliate against the sanctions.

The People's Bank of China, PBoC, urged some lenders to prevent any “herd behavior” in the currency market, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

The move helped stabilized the offshore yuan and arrived just days after the PBoC on Friday raised the cost of shorting the currency.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's lira held close to its record low against the dollar on Tuesday as concerns deepened about a rift with the United States and President Tayyip Erdogan's influence over the central bank.
The currency had fallen as much as 5.5 percent on Monday to 5.4250 per dollar, an all-time low and its biggest intraday drop in nearly a decade, after Washington said it was reviewing access to the U.S. market for Turkey's exports.
It slipped in and out of negative territory on Tuesday and was trading at 5.3035 to the dollar  and 6.1535 per euro  at 1201 GMT (8.01 a.m. ET). Turkey's 10-year benchmark bond yield hit 20.09 percent, the highest on record.
The depth of the sell-off reflects growing unease about the direction of monetary policy under Erdogan, a self-described ""enemy of interest rates"", and the impact of worsening ties with the United States, a NATO ally and major trading partner.
The lira's chronic weakness -- it is down 27 percent on the dollar and 26 percent against the euro year-to-date -- has driven inflation to nearly 16 percent and fueled expectations that an emergency rate hike may be needed to prop it up. 
""The plunge in the currency over the past few weeks is now on a scale which has, in the past, prompted the central bank to hike interest rates aggressively,"" William Jackson of Capital Economics said in a note to clients.
""The lira's fall is being amplified by concerns that the central bank will not act to shore up the currency."" 
The central bank raised interest rates to support the lira in an emergency move in May, before a re-elected Erdogan assumed new executive powers that investors fear will compromise its independence.
He wants lower borrowing costs to fuel credit growth and economic expansion. Economists say the economy is overheated and needs higher rates.
The central bank's apparent reluctance to hike has heightened concerns about its ability to act independently of the president, who appointed his son-in-law Berat Albayrak as treasury and finance minister last month. 
U.S ROW
The row with the United States has only served to further undermine sentiment among foreign investors, upon whom Turkey relies to fund its widening current account deficit. 
A Turkish foreign ministry source said a delegation led by new deputy foreign minister Sedat Onal would go to Washington to discuss the row between the NATO allies, which the U.S. Embassy in Ankara said maintained solid political and economic ties.
Broadcaster CNN Turk said the delegation would include three officials apiece from the justice, finance and foreign ministries and would hold its first meeting on Wednesday. 
Relations have been strained by differences over Syria, and the trial in Turkey of U.S. evangelical Christian pastor Andrew Brunson for allegedly supporting the group Ankara blames for an attempted coup in 2016. Brunson denies the charge. 
The United States is seeking the release from detention of three locally employed embassy staff.
At the weekend, the U.S. Trade Representative said the United States was reviewing Turkey's duty-free access to its markets, after Ankara imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods in response to American tariffs on steel and aluminum. The move could affect $1.7 billion of Turkish exports.
The spat has further hammered the lira, which lost nearly a quarter of its value last year, even after a cut to the upper limit of banks' reserve requirements that the central bank said on Monday would provide lenders with $2.2 billion of liquidity.
""In an environment where the market expects an interest rate hike, the central bank only changed reserve requirements,"" said economist Mahfi Egilmez on Twitter.
""The lira plunged as markets got the impression that the central bank has problems hiking rates. It would have been better if they did not change the reserve requirements at all.""
NO HEADLINES
Erdogan, who has previously cast lira selling as the work of Western financiers attempting to bring Turkey to its knees, has been notably quiet about the crisis this time around. Last week, he called on Turks to convert hard currency and gold into lira and said Turkey would turn to Chinese markets for financing.
Local media made almost no mention of the currency crisis on Tuesday. 
The lira's plunge has sharpened investor concern about the outlook for Turkish companies, which may struggle to repay some $223 billion of debt they have raised in dollar and euros.
Credit ratings agency Moody's has predicted problem loans will rise to well above 4 percent in the next 12-18 months, from 2.9 percent from May, which would also be costly for banks.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) meanwhile warned that a further drop in the lira could wipe out Turkish banks' capital buffers.

Turkish stocks were up half a percent. The BIST index of blue-chip stocks (XU030) is down 40 percent in dollar terms this year, according to Thomson Reuters data -- second only to Venezuela as the worst performer among some 30 emerging market stock indices.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The pound stayed fragile on Tuesday after falling to an 11-month low against the dollar overnight on worries over a 'hard' Brexit from the European Union, while simmering U.S.-China trade tensions provided support to the greenback.

638,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 03:10PM ET</span>",It's Goldman Versus Morgan Stanley When It Comes to Mexico's Peso,"(Bloomberg) -- Two of Wall Street’s most storied banks, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), are at odds over the direction of the Mexican peso, the world’s best-performing currency in July.
Goldman Sachs says there’s still room for gains, even after the peso’s 7 percent rally. Morgan Stanley begs to differ, saying the currency is close to a selling point. Either way, the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement is key.
""Even with the move, the currency still screens as undervalued,"" Goldman Sachs strategists Zach Pandl, Kamakshya Trivedi and Caesar Maasry wrote in a note today. The reasoning: Moderating inflation under a vigilant central bank, tempered rhetoric from incoming President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and of course progress on Nafta talks. While the peso’s path could be gradual and subject to volatility, Goldman Sachs pegs it at 18.5 to the dollar in November and 17.75 next August.
Morgan Stanley, however, says it’s time to short the Mexican peso by betting on the Colombian peso or, for investors willing to shoulder cross-regional risks, the Indian rupee.
""Our model is very close to flagging a sell signal on the currency,"" London-based Morgan Stanley strategists including James Lord and Min Dai wrote in a note, also today. ""Good news on Nafta is broadly in the price and we think that the risks are tilted towards underperformance now.""
The Mexican peso has rallied 13 percent since reaching a 15-month low on June 14, two weeks before the vote. Lopez Obrador, popularly known as AMLO, swept to victory and proceeded to project an unexpectedly pro-markets tone. Spreads on Mexican five-year credit default swaps have narrowed by 35 basis points since then, while the benchmark stock index rose 4.5 percent.
Mexico Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo told reporters in Mexico City today that his team will be back in Washington D.C. at the middle of this week to continue Nafta talks with U.S. counterparts."

The lira slumped as much as 4 percent, while the rate on 10-year bonds hovered just below 20 percent after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday that Turkey will respond in kind to U.S. sanctions over a detained American pastor. As the currency tumbled, Turkish policymakers changed reserve rules to boost banks’ foreign-exchange liquidity -- a measure seen by analysts as insufficient to prop up the the lira.
“This is chump change and the fact that this is all they can do while the lira is in free-fall is quite disappointing,” said Win Thin, a strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
With the lira already under pressure from one of the largest current-account deficits in emerging markets, escalating tension has fueled the currency’s loss this year to 28 percent against the dollar. That has hampered the ability of companies to repay their foreign-currency loans, stoked inflation and put pressure on the central bank to keep raising rates. The bank is scheduled to next meet on Sept. 13.
The move by Turkey’s central bank on Monday to adjust the reserve options mechanism will only lead to more currency weakness, according to Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Lutz Karpowitz in Frankfurt. Overall, unwillingness to raise rates is a dovish signal, and is likely to trigger more lira weakness, he said.
Then lira dropped 3.9 percent to 5.28 per dollar at 1:35 p.m. in New York. The yield on the nation’s benchmark bonds rose to a record 19 percent, while Turkish stocks slid to the lowest in nearly two weeks.

In series of tweets over the weekend, Trump claimed the tariffs are working ""big time"" and that imported goods should be taxed or made in the United States.

Under the measures, the central bank will allow the market to determine the rate of foreign-exchange transactions except the imports of essential goods and drugs, Governor Abdolnaser Hemmati told state television Sunday night. Licensed currency houses whose trading had been halted will be allowed to resume operations from Tuesday, he said.
The rial’s slump to record lows has been at the heart of an escalating crisis facing Iran’s economy as the U.S., encouraged by Iranian foes in the Middle East, seeks to isolate the Islamic Republic after pulling out of the 2015 nuclear deal. One person was killed and 20 other detained in the city of Karaj, west of Tehran, in a protest on Friday. In another town, about 500 people used stones and bricks to smash the windows of a seminary and tried to set the building ablaze, local media reported.
“With activity being banned on the free market, people couldn’t access their foreign- currency needs and alternative prices had taken shape which led to corruption,” Hemmati said, according to the state-run Iranian Students News Agency.
“Given that we have suitable currency reserves we decided to allow the market to carry out its activity and let supply and demand form.”
A central bank official said exchange houses will determine the rial’s rate without any guidance from the regulator. Customers, however, will have to show a compelling reason to buy dollars, such as travel, medical or education expenses, and won’t be able to get large amounts, according to the official, who asked not to be named because he’s not authorized to speak to the media.
Policy Backfired
Earlier this year, the central bank said it would unify the exchange rate at 42,000 rials to the dollar in an attempt to root out unregulated trading. It banned exchange houses from selling foreign currencies, and authorities arrested dozens for allegedly manipulating the rules for personal gain. Among those detained is a central bank deputy governor in charge of foreign-currency affairs.
But the policies backfired, with the rial weakening to more than 100,000 to the dollar on the black market this month.
On Ferdowsi Avenue in downtown Tehran -- the heart of foreign-exchange trading in the capital -- some stores were shut while others had signs reading “No dollar sales to individuals” and boards showing zeros next to all currencies. Some dealers on street corners whispering “Dollar...Currency.”
Traders present at empty exchange houses were skeptical that the central bank’s U-turn will work this time around. One said he was ready to sell $2,000 to anyone without documents.
The currency crisis has heaped more pressure on Rouhani, a moderate cleric who was first elected president in 2013 on promises to end Iran’s international isolation. He championed the 2015 agreement with global powers to curb Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.
U.S. President Donald Trump condemned the pact as a “disaster” that would ultimately lead to a nuclear-armed Iran. European powers, who are attempting to limit the damage imposed by sanctions, and international nuclear monitors say Iran is sticking to the accord.
Starting Tuesday, the U.S. will ban purchases of dollar banknotes by Iran, prevent the government from trading gold and other precious metals, and block the nation from selling or acquiring various industrial metals. The measures also target the auto industry, and will ban exports of Persian carpets and pistachios to the U.S.
Hemmati was appointed late last month with Rouhani stressing that the challenges facing the country called for “fresh blood.” The president has instructed Hemmati to work on preserving Iran’s foreign-currency reserves while looking for “new tactics and approaches” to counter U.S. attempts to disrupt Iran’s banking relations with the world.
The list of essential goods that will be imported under the central bank’s fixed exchange rate will be announced by the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Mines.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The Turkish lira tumbled to a record low against the dollar on Monday, after the Trump administration said it was reviewing Turkey's duty-free access to the U.S. market, a move that could affect some $1.66 billion of Turkish imports.
The review by the U.S. Trade Representative's office, announced on Friday, came after Ankara imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods in response to American tariffs on steel and aluminium.
Relations between the NATO allies have steadily worsened, strained by differences over Syria policy and an escalating row over the trial in Turkey of an American Christian pastor, Andrew Brunson. That friction has exacerbated the sell-off in the lira.
The currency  has lost a quarter of its value this year, battered mainly by concern about President Tayyip Erdogan's drive for greater control over monetary policy. On Monday, it touched a record low of 5.18 against the dollar. By 0941 GMT (5.41 a.m. ET) it was at 5.1750.
""The best bet now is to expect further weakness in the lira -- Turkey really doesn't need this,"" said Per Hammarlund, chief emerging markets strategist at SEB. 
""They should be doing more to support the lira, but in my view this will continue for a while longer and the lira will take another beating here.""
USTR REVIEW
The U.S. Trade Representative's office said the review could affect $1.66 billion worth of Turkish imports into the United States that benefited from the Generalised System of Preferences programme last year, including motor vehicles and parts, jewelry, precious metals and stone products.
It was unclear whether any large, listed Turkish firms would be hit by the move. Auto parts suppliers tend to be smaller, unlisted companies. Istanbul's main index (XU100) fell 1.7 percent.
""This review will impact many companies exporting to the United States, but it will have a very small impact on the income streams of these companies,"" said an analyst at a local brokerage, who declined to be named.
Data from the U.S. International Trade Commission showed that the biggest beneficiary of the duty-free programme were auto and auto parts makers, with imports of nearly $250 million last year. That was followed by precious stones and metals, at nearly $210 million. 
A USTR spokeswoman said the review was unrelated to issues surrounding Brunson, - a case that has prompted U.S. sanctions against two Turkish cabinet ministers.
Erdogan said on Saturday the sanctions by Washington against his ministers were disrespectful and that Turkey would retaliate by freezing assets of U.S. interior and justice ministers.
Bilateral relations have plummeted over the fate of Brunson, who was held in a Turkish prison for 21 months until he was transferred to house arrest.

Brunson, who has lived in Turkey for more than two decades, faces up to 35 years in jail if found guilty of the charges, which he denies.

GBP/USD hit a low of 1.2956, its weakest level since September 4 was down 0.31% to 1.2962 by 05:24 AM ET (09:24 GMT).
The drop in the pound came after Liam Fox said in an interview published in the Sunday Times newspaper that there was a 60:40 chance that the UK would leave the European Union without an agreement.
He accused the European Commission of “intransigence.” putting EU rules above economic well-being.
The remarks came after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned Friday that there is an “uncomfortably high” risk of Britain exiting the EU with no deal.
The pound was also weaker against the euro, with EUR/GBP rising 0.24% to 0.8918.
In the euro area, data on Monday showed that German factory orders slumped by 4% in June, the biggest fall in almost 18 months amid weaker overseas demand.
The unexpectedly weak data added to fears over the economic impact of rising trade tensions.
The euro was trading near four-and-a-half week lows against the dollar, with EUR/USD edging down to 1.1561.

645,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>",Lira Extends Longest Losing Streak Since May to Fresh Record Low,"(Bloomberg) -- The Turkish lira fell against the dollar for a sixth day and government bonds dropped as a showdown with the U.S. over a detained American pastor continued to weigh on investor sentiment.
The currency weakened 1.1 percent to a record low amid its longest streak of losses in three months, while the yield on 10-year bonds touched an all-time high. The lack of liquidity in the lira market and broad dollar strength are compounding the move, according to an Istanbul-based trader who asked not to be named as they are not authorized to speak publicly.
While President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday that Turkey will respond in kind to the U.S. decision to sanction two government ministers, speculation that the dispute will eventually be resolved has increased. Erdogan said he believed that the two NATO partners will “leave behind a major chunk of differences” soon, a sign that a breakthrough in one of the worst diplomatic crises between the nations is possible.
“It’s worth noting that Erdogan has been trying to use very careful language as much as he can,” analysts at Global Securities in Istanbul, including the head of research, Sertan Kargin, wrote in a note to clients. “It seems there is still room for a diplomatic exit, although more time and effort are needed to bridge the gap between the two countries. Should this be the case, lira assets could recover strongly and swiftly.”
The lira is already under pressure from one of the largest current-account deficits in emerging markets, and the risk that U.S. President Donald Trump makes good on his pledge to impose large sanctions on Turkey if it doesn’t release pastor Andrew Brunson is further undermining confidence.
The currency has weakened more 25 percent against the dollar this year, hampering the ability of companies to repay their foreign-currency loans, stoking inflation and putting pressure on the central bank to keep raising rates. The bank is next scheduled to meet on Sept. 13.
The lira was 0.6 percent weaker at 5.1136 against the dollar as of 10:43 a.m. Istanbul time after earlier touching 5.1419 per greenback. The yield on 10-year government bonds jumped as much as 49 basis point to 19.68 percent.

The onshore yuan trimmed earlier gains and was little changed at 6.8300 per dollar as of 1:15 p.m. The People’s Bank of China set the daily reference rate at 6.8513, the weakest since May last year, though in line with analyst expectations.

Here’s a look at some of the moves on Monday:
Zhang Gang, Shanghai-based strategist with Central China Securities Co.:
On Friday evening:
The timing of the announcements seemed coordinated to avoid kneejerk declines in China’s currency from the tariff proposal, according to  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn). Imposing a levy on forward trades is a tactic that the central bank used to stabilize the yuan against the dollar in the aftermath of its shock devaluation in 2015. China’s currency and stocks are both among the world’s worst performers over the past three months.
“The yuan kept falling when China did this last time in 2015, so I don’t think the PBOC’s move will significantly change the market tone,” Hao Hong, chief strategist at Bocom International Holdings Co., said by phone. “The trade war is nowhere near its end and China’s economy is slowing down, so why would the trend reverse?”
The Ministry of Finance said that duties ranging from 5 percent to 25 percent will be levied on more than 5,000 categories of American imports if the U.S. delivers its proposed taxes on another $200 billion of Chinese goods. The list targets everything from planes and computers to wigs and textiles, with the highest tariff applying to more than 2,400 products such as meat, wheat, wine and liquefied natural gas.
The effective additional tariff rate is about 13 percent, which is much less than a proportional retaliation,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). economists wrote in a note. “Nevertheless, this measure still marks a step up in US-China trade tensions.”
“The news headlines from Friday will have some negative impact on share market sentiment,” said Dai Ming, Shanghai-based fund manager with Hengsheng Asset Management Co., who added that he doesn’t expect Chinese equities to recover until there’s evidence that the trade dispute is being resolved. “The stock market isn’t the government’s priority.”
China’s stock woes have caught the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who tweeted about the market’s underperformance versus U.S. shares on Saturday and told a rally in Ohio that the declines are weakening that nation’s bargaining power in the trade war. And White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow suggested Friday that China is letting its currency fall to offset losses from the trade war, though he added that the decline is partly due to weak economic fundamentals.
Eight straight weeks of losses have brought the yuan close to 7 per dollar, a level it hasn’t reached in more than a decade. Analysts had identified that as a key milestone where officials may seek to arrest declines, to counteract the mounting risk of capital outflows. China burned through foreign reserves propping up its currency after the devaluation almost three years ago spurred a rush to take money out of the country.
The levy on forwards is aimed at preventing macro financial risks as the foreign-exchange market shows signs of volatility amid recent trade frictions, and shouldn’t be interpreted as a capital control, according to the PBOC.

648,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 01:09AM ET</span>","Dollar remains steady after U.S. jobs data, focus on yuan","By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held firm against a basket of its peers on Monday after U.S. job data reinforced investors' expectations the Federal Reserve will gradually raise interest rates this year.
The dollar, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was about 0.1 percent higher at 95.259, crawling back to a more-than-one-year peak of 95.652 reached on July 19.
Investor attention has shifted to the yuan after the People's Bank of China on Friday made it more expensive to bet against the currency, which helped it rebound from a near 15-month low against the greenback.
U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in July, but a fall in the unemployment rate suggested that labor market conditions were tightening.
""We're seeing pretty consistent dollar strength across the board. The theme is there,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo branch manager at State Street Bank.
""Although Friday maybe didn't hit the target when it comes to the non-farm payrolls, it was still a positive number. It's a good and strong number. If you line that up with previous releases, you see a trend,"" he said.
The Fed kept rates unchanged as widely expected last Wednesday, and gave an upbeat assessment of the world's biggest economy.
The euro was frail after slipping to a 4-1/2-week low against the dollar on Monday.
The single currency traded at $1.1563, near an intra-day low of $1.1557, its lowest level since changing hands at $1.15275 on June 28.
Offshore yuan was 0.14 percent higher on the day, trading at 6.8400 yuan per dollar.
The yuan pulled away from a near 15-month low against the greenback on Friday after China's central bank said it would set a reserve requirement ratio of 20 percent from Monday on financial institutions settling foreign exchange forward dollar sales to clients, effectively raising the cost for investors betting against the yuan.
Kumiko Ishikawa, senior analyst at Sony Financial Holdings, said she thought it was likely China would allow the yuan to weaken further from its current level despite the move on Friday.
""The U.S. isn't criticizing China very strongly on exchange rates, so for the time being it's very likely the yuan will continue to depreciate,"" she said.
The British pound ticked down to $1.2997, staying near a 2-1/2-week low of 1.2975 hit on Friday, while the Australian dollar was off slightly at $0.7394.
The yen weakened less than 0.1 percent against the dollar to 111.34 yen on Monday.
The yen had risen about 0.4 percent on Friday on worries about Sino-U.S. trade tensions after China proposed retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods such as liquefied natural gas and aircraft.
But State Street Bank's Wakabayashi said the negative impact on markets from the trade tariff exchanges between Washington and Beijing is not as acute it had been previously.
""Whenever there is an imbalance in the market in terms of uncertainty, the initial flight to safety is probably to the dollar, which is the preferred currency right now,"" said Wakabayashi.

""We could extend that a bit to the yen, but definitely the dollar is receiving a lot of support,"" he said.

649,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 12:19AM ET</span>",Forex - Yuan Little Changed After PBOC Announces Supportive Measures,"Investing.com - The Chinese yuan was little changed on Monday as trade dispute with the U.S. continued to boil. The Chinese currencies rallied on Friday after the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) announced supportive measures.
The onshore yuan was little changed at 6.8286 per dollar by 12:10AM ET (04:10 GMT), while the offshore yuan was also stronger against the dollar.
The PBOC said on Friday that it would impose a 20% reserve requirement on some trading of foreign-exchange forward contracts, effectively making it more expensive to short the yuan.
Separately, an hour after the announcement, Chinese authorities announced that it would impose tariffs, ranging from 5% to 35%, on $60 billion in U.S. goods that include many agriculture-related goods if the U.S. proceeded with placing more tariffs on Chinese imports.
The warnings came after U.S. President Donald Trump urged U.S. Trade Representative to consider raising the proposed tariffs on Chinese goods to 25% from the initial 10% earlier this month.
The U.S. Dollar Index, on the other hand, was up 0.06% to 95.09 on Monday following the development.
“The yuan kept falling when China did this last time in 2015, so I don’t think the PBOC’s move will significantly change the market tone,” Hao Hong, chief strategist at Bocom International Holdings Co., said by phone. “The trade war is nowhere near its end and China’s economy is slowing down, so why would the trend reverse?”

650,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2018 09:22PM ET</span>","Iran eases currency rules, hoping to buoy rial ahead of sanctions","By Parisa Hafezi
ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran will ease foreign exchange rules, state TV reported on Sunday, in a bid to halt a collapse of the rial currency that has lost half its value since April due to fears about U.S. sanctions likely to be imposed this week.
President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of an agreement to lift sanctions in return for Iran curbing its nuclear program caused a run on the rial as companies and savers bought hard currency to protect themselves from the looming economic sanctions.
The plunge in the currency and soaring inflation have sparked sporadic demonstrations against profiteering and corruption, with many protesters chanting anti-government slogans.
The central bank has blamed ""enemies"" for the fall of the currency, and the judiciary said 29 people had been arrested on charges that carry the death penalty. On Sunday the judiciary said it had arrested a further seven people, including a former deputy central bank governor and five foreign exchange dealers.
A state body led by President Hassan Rouhani and including the heads of the judiciary and parliament on Sunday partially lifted a ban on the sale of foreign currency at floating rates, allowing exchange bureaux to sell at unofficial market rates for purposes such as overseas travel. 
That reverses the decision in April to ban trading currency outside the rate of about 42,000 rials to the dollar 
Ahead of the announcement of the new measures, the rial gained slightly on the unofficial market, trading at 98,500 to the dollar, compared with 103,000 on Saturday, according to foreign exchange website Boncast.com.
Central bank governor Abdolnaser Hemmati said the plan reflected Iran's self-confidence in the face of the looming U.S. sanctions.
""This shows our power. The same day you (Americans) impose sanctions we open our economy. We have no problems, so why should our people worry?,"" Hemmati said in a live televised interview. 
In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the White House would make an announcement on Monday detailing the reimposition of sanctions on Iran that Trump has ordered for this week.
Hemmati said the central bank would allow a ""managed float"" of the rial's exchange rate and try to avoid using up its reserves to support the currency.
""The central bank will try not to interfere in setting the price of hard currencies, which will be determined by supply and demand, however, the bank's supervision will prevent unbridled (market swings) and the creation of a black market,"" Hemmati said.
To encourage Iranians to return their hard cash to the economy, the plan allows the central bank to set up dollar savings accounts for ordinary people, state television said.
Non-oil exporters will be allowed to sell hard currency to importers, and there will be no limit on bringing currency or gold into the country.
It was not immediately clear whether the plan would create enough hard currency inflows to ease the demand for dollars and help end a panic-buying of hard currencies by many Iranians.
Protests broke out on Sunday for a sixth night in cities including Kazeroon in the south, according to social media. Authorities reported the first fatality among protesters, with the shooting of a man in Karaj, west of Tehran. But they denied security forces were involved, Iranian news agencies reported. 
Hard currency will be made available at a subsidized rate for purchases of basic goods and medicine, state television quoted a government statement about the plan as saying.
In July, Iran opened a secondary foreign-exchange market for importers of non-essential goods that are not eligible to receive the preferential rate from the central bank.
Starting this week, Washington will re-impose sanctions on Iran's purchases of U.S. dollars, its trade in gold and precious metals, and its dealings with metals, coal and industrial-related software.

The United States has told third countries they must halt imports of Iranian oil from early November or face U.S. financial measures.

652,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>",How Low Can They Go? Emerging-Market Currencies Near a Key Level,"(Bloomberg) -- Emerging-market currencies, pummeled in the second quarter by a strong U.S. dollar, are closing in on a key resistance level whose rupture could open the way to further declines.
The MSCI Emerging Markets Currency Index has hovered near 1,628.25 since completing its 5.5 percent swoon in the period, barely budging between 1,615 and 1,630. That stability suggests the gauge is testing the Fibonacci projection level of 1,619 that served as a floor in late September, late October and mid-November. If that barrier is breached, the next resistance would be at around 1,580 -- meaning a further 2.5 percent drop.
While each currency in the basket that makes up the gauge has its own technical levels and idiosyncratic drivers, the benchmark’s move suggests the asset class is at a key technical juncture. Adding weight to the theory are expectations the dollar will strengthen anew as U.S. interest rates rise, reducing demand for risky assets such as emerging markets.
“A major driver of EM year-to-date has been the strengthening dollar, and since it seemed to stabilize in late June, we have seen a more constructive environment for EM assets,” said James Syme, an emerging-market specialist who helps oversee London-based JO Hambro Capital. Going forward, though, recent U.S. economic data has been strong and the Federal Reserve is on course to shrink its balance sheet -- signs of a stronger dollar, Syme said.
Half of the 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg have strengthened since the end of June, led by some of the worst casualties of the second-quarter carnage including the Brazilian real, Mexico’s peso and the South African rand.
MSCI’s currency gauge has dropped 3.3 percent so far this year and was poised for a weekly decline. "

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.15% to 94.86.
The U.S. economy added just 157,000 jobs in June, well below forecasts for 193,000 new jobs, while the unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.9%, the Labor Department said on Friday.
Analysts played down the weaker nonfarm payrolls, saying the underlying trend of U.S. job creation remained on track.

Average hourly earnings grew 0.3% in July, and 2.7% in the 12 months through July, in line with economists' forecasts. But analysts said the timid wage growth does little to support the Fed's position that tighter labor markets would lead to price pressures.
""Wages are moving up but we're not seeing a spike in wages that would concern the market about a sudden rise in inflation,"" said Evan Brown, director of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management. ""There's not much of a reaction in markets at the moment.""

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Major state-owned Chinese banks were seen selling dollars on Friday afternoon in an apparent attempt to put a floor under a tumbling yuan, as the worsening trade dispute between the United States and China drove the currency to a fresh 14-month low.
The banks were seen selling dollars at around 6.9 per dollar in the onshore foreign exchange market in afternoon trade, three traders said.
The onshore spot market  opened at 6.8571 per dollar, weakening to a low of 6.8965 at one point on Friday afternoon, its lowest level since May 15, 2017. It finished domestic trading at 6.8620 at 0830 GMT.
Its offshore counterpart was trading at 6.8968 per dollar as of 0914 GMT.
The yuan is on track to fall for eight consecutive weeks, its longest weekly losing streak since the exchange rate mechanism was unified in 1994.
The currency came under more pressure this week after the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump proposed raising tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to the United States.
China vowed to retaliate with higher tariffs of its own, with a Foreign Ministry spokesman saying U.S. efforts at ""blackmail"" would fail.
A trader at an Asian bank in Shanghai said the Chinese response indicated the trade row was ""very severe"" and that a long-term depreciation trend in the yuan ""should not be ruled out.""
Traders said state-run banks remained active in the dollar-yuan swaps market, although they weren't entirely sure if they were using swaps to borrow the dollars they were selling in the spot market. 
Their heavy swapping of yuan for dollars in forwards in recent weeks has seen the one-year value of the yuan  rise above spot levels. On Friday, one-year yuan was quoted around 6.8440 per dollar.
""Big banks have not alleviated their selling pressure in the swap market, despite the onshore spot yuan showing some signs of stabilization earlier this week. It unarguably shows authorities' attempt to stabilize the yuan from sinking too fast,"" said the trader in Shanghai.
The yuan's rapid depreciation has prompted market talk over the potential for the yuan to breach 7 per dollar in the near term.
A trader at a foreign bank said the state banks' dollar selling on Friday took place in the last hour before the close of onshore trade, seen as an attempt to stabilize its closing price.
The onshore closing price is used by the central bank to help determine the official midpoint of the yuan's trading band for the next day of trade.

State-owned banks sold dollars in the forex market regularly in late 2015 and 2016 in what some traders believed was part of official efforts to prop up the yuan.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, increased 0.08% to 95.08 as of 5:00 AM ET (9:00 GMT).
The dollar was boosted after the Fed left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, as expected. The central bank upgraded its view on the economy, as strong U.S. economic data supports gradual rate hikes to continue.
Trade uncertainty remained on investors minds after reports that the White House plans to propose 25% instead of 10% on $200 billion of imported Chinese goods. The two largest economies in the world have been in a tit-for-tat trade war over the last few months, which has weighed heavily on markets.
China has responded that it would retaliate if the U.S. continues to impose fresh trade tariffs but with the U.S. importing more from China, investors see a trade war hurting Beijing more. The Chinese offshore yuan was near a 15-month low due to trade war fear, with USD/CNH up 0.22% to 6.8962
The dollar was higher against the safe-haven yen, with USD/JPY increasing 0.06% to 111.71. In times of uncertainty, investors tend to invest in the Japanese yen, which is considered a safe asset during periods of risk aversion.
The euro was down with EUR/USD inching down 0.06% to 1.1577.
Sterling was also lower with GBP/USD falling 0.17% to 1.2996, after the Bank of England decided to increase interest rates on Thursday despite Brexit concerns.
Australian dollar was also under pressure due to Sino-U.S. trade tensions with AUD/USD flat at 0.7358 while NZD/USD inched down 0.27% to 0.6738. The loonie was higher against the greenback, with USD/CAD down 0.01% to 1.3021."
657,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 04:30AM ET</span>",Japanese foreign debt investors few ticks away from being lured back home,"By Tomo Uetake and Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's latest tweak to its ultra-easy monetary policy settings has nudged its bond yields higher but not nearly enough to entice hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Japanese investment in overseas debt to return home.
At this week's policy review, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) signaled a greater tolerance for higher rates, allowing 10-year bonds to trade at yields as high as 0.2 percent and forcing a rethink among domestic investors who have as much as 232 trillion yen ($2.1 trillion) in higher-yielding foreign currency debt.
Take the case of the 30-year paper. If yields on this maturity climb to 1 percent, up about 15 basis points from current levels, these bonds will become an attractive alternative to yen-based investments in U.S. and European debt.
Moreover, if the yen appreciates on rising yields, it then gets costlier to put money to work overseas, in which case keeping their yen invested in Japanese government bonds (JGBs) becomes a more attractive option. 
Masahiko Loo, a portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein in Tokyo, said the rise in yields this week wasn't sufficient to lure Japanese investors away from U.S. and other higher yielding markets.
""If 30-year JGBs sell off to 1 percent, we think that Japanese investors will definitely be repatriating some of their foreign assets back to JGBs,"" Loo said. 
With a negative short-term policy rate, and 10-year bonds trading around 0.13 percent, Japan is easily one of the world's lowest yielding markets. 
That is one big reason why Japanese investors have traditionally ploughed swathes of cash into foreign debt. Ten-year Treasuries yield 2.99 percent, German bunds of that tenor yield 0.46 percent and Italian debt returns 2.9 percent.
All the same, these investments in dollars or euros carry exchange rate risk that could erode returns. Japanese investors have traditionally chosen to buy protection against that risk on most of their foreign bond investments.
A short-term hedge for an investment in U.S. dollars could set a yen investor back by as much as 2.6 to 2.9 percent, meaning net returns on Treasuries are just around 37 basis points at most. 
The bulk of Japanese overseas debt holdings is in dollars, a legacy of their investment when dollar hedging costs were much lower. At the end of 2017, they held about $1.3 trillion worth of dollar debt, $458 billion of debt in euros and $178 billion in Australian dollars.
THE 1 PERCENT WAIT
Thirty-year JGBs now yield about 0.85 percent, up 17 bps in the past two weeks and another 15-20 bps of increases to 1.0 percent could swing Japanese investors in their favor.
The policy announcement this week, however, underwhelmed investors. While the BOJ raised the upper bound on 10-year bond yields to 0.2 percent, double the earlier limit, it committed to keeping longer term rates low under its 5-year long qualitative and quantitative easing program.
""That pretty much seals the fate of the Japanese investor. He's got to go elsewhere,"" said Bob Smith, President of Sage Advisory Services Ltd.
Japan's life insurance companies in particular have been waiting for a minimum yield of 1 percent on their long term bond holdings ever since the BOJ's switch to negative interest rates and a yield-targeting policy in 2016.
That's because the estimated average return these insurance firms have promised their policyholders over the years is close to 1 percent.
""Domestic bond yields have not risen to the levels that would attract aggressive buying from Japanese investors,” said Atsushi Tachibana, chief investment officer at Japan Post Insurance (Kampo) (T:7181). 
Kampo is Japan's largest insurance company with assets of 77 trillion yen as of end-March.
Nippon Life, Japan’s largest private life insurance company, with assets of 66 trillion yen as of end-March, also said it plans to increase its holdings of foreign bonds, but without currency hedging.

""The BOJ policy changes are not material enough to steepen the JGB curve and incentivize Japanese investors to repatriate investments in the U.S. and Europe,"" said Ed Al-Hussainy, an analyst at Columbia Threadneedle Investments in Minneapolis.

658,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 01:04AM ET</span>",Dollar stays firm on U.S.-China trade war worries,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies on Friday and hit a more than 14-month high against the yuan, with markets gripped by worries over escalating trade tensions between the United States and China. 
China vowed on Thursday to retaliate if the U.S. acted on a threat to raise tariffs on the Asian nation's exports, after U.S. President Donald Trump instructed his trade officials to look at increasing tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion in Chinese imports into the United States.
But, as the United States imports far more from China, than China does from the United States, investors see a trade war causing greater pain for the Chinese economy.
""It seems that the markets are reacting to the U.S.-China trade war as the U.S. is the winner whereas China is the loser,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities.
""The Chinese markets are generally weak. That's why renminbi's weakness is leading the dollar's strength,"" he said.
China's offshore yuan, which has been under pressure for months due to worries over the trade rift, weakened to 6.8975 per dollar , its lowest since May 15, 2017, before steadying slightly to last trade at 6.8888.
China's onshore yuan briefly slipped to 6.8767 per dollar , its lowest since May 25, 2017. It last traded at 6.8681 yuan per dollar.
""Chinese authorities want to engineer the moderate weakness, the slow depreciation of the renminbi but it is very difficult,"" said Yamamoto.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, hit a fresh two-week high of 95.211. It changed hands at 95.139 at 0421 GMT.
The euro traded near a two-week low at $1.1591 (EUR=).
The dollar was nearly flat against the yen , trading at 111.70 yen. The U.S. and Japan are expected to hold their first bilateral trade talks in Washington on Aug. 9.
""The U.S. is looking to achieve some kind of results (in its trade conflict) with China to start off with,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, chief currency strategist at Daiwa Securities.
""I think one purpose of the trade consultations between the U.S. and Japan is to find common ground vis-à-vis China,"" he said.
The Australian dollar, seen as a proxy for Chinese growth because of Australia's export-reliant economy, was under pressure as the Sino-U.S. trade tensions overwhelmed upbeat retail sales data at home.
The Aussie traded at $0.7370 , a touch above a two-week low of $0.7355 touched the previous day.
Elsewhere, the pound remained frail even after the Bank of England on Thursday raised its policy interest rate from 0.5 to 0.75 percent following an unanimous decision of its nine-member policy board.
Sterling on Friday traded at $1.3020, coming off slightly from a two-week low of $1.3006  hit earlier in the day.
It had slumped as much as 0.8 percent on Thursday in the aftermath of the BOE's decision to lift interest rates.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said monetary policy needed to ""walk not run"" while expressing worries about the risks of a cliff-edged Brexit.
A cliff-edged Brexit could lead to higher tariffs and other strict rules on the border, which will hurt the U.K. economy, said Mizuho Securities' Yamamoto.

""These are the things traders have on their mind so they cannot fully follow the hawkish signs of the Bank of England,"" he said.

659,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 12:59AM ET</span>",Forex - Yuan Heading for Eighth Weekly Decline; Dollar Little Changed ,"Investing.com – The Chinese yuan continued to slide on Friday and is now down 6% against the dollar since June. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, was little changed at 94.99 ahead of the July jobs U.S. report due later in the day.
The USD/CNY pair gained 0.4% to 6.8713, as analysts believed the combination of rising Treasury yields and greenback would be a volatile mix and could cause further loss to the yuan.
“For now, markets have had good reason to be calm despite the renminbi’s slide; so far the renminbi has merely retraced its steps back to where it was in early 2017. Last year was politically important so the authorities had a particularly tight grip on capital outflows,” Freya Beamish, Pantheon Macroeconomics Ltd said. “At this stage, trade tensions are helping the renminbi to weaken, and we’ve seen capital outflows beginning modestly to re-build. If, for instance, Mr. Trump were actually to impose further tariffs, that would cause a further renminbi depreciation. If we get back to where we were at the end of 2016, then I think we’d start to see markets outside of China reacting to renminbi weakness,” she added.
Meanwhile, in a note dated Aug. 1, Deutsche Bank AG said it expects the yuan to trade at 6.95 and 7.40 against the dollar by the end of 2018 and 2019 respectively, compared with a previous forecast of 6.80 and 7.20.
The U.S. dollar received some support in the previous session from trade tensions that returned to focus this week but remained little changed on Friday, as traders await the monthly jobs report due later in the day for more cues.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely rose by 190,000 jobs in July after increasing by 213,000 in June.
""A decent jobs report should prompt a straight-forward reaction by the markets, with U.S. yields rising and the dollar gaining,"" said Ichikawa at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management.
Meanwhile, the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield rose 0.06% to 2.988%.
The USD/JPY pair dollar added 0.04% to 111.70. The dollar rose against the yen earlier this week after the Bank of Japan tweaked its monetary policy but decided to keep interest rates low."

The Chinese Internet giant, which  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) removed from its “focus list” on Thursday, rose 1.4 percent Friday, its first gain in seven sessions.
The Hang Seng Index was little changed Friday morning and in line for a weekly loss of 3.8 percent. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index fell 0.3 percent, extending its decline this week to 3.2 percent. The yield on 10-year Chinese sovereign debt was steady at 3.48 percent.

661,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 02:55PM ET</span>",Venezuela's Constituent Assembly legalizes money exchanges,"By Vivian Sequera and Angus Berwick
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's all-powerful Constituent Assembly on Thursday voted to legalize money exchange operations to relax the strict currency controls imposed by the social government that have throttled the oil-rich nation's economy. 
The measure's reach was not immediately clear and previous moves to tweak the economic model have had little impact. It is unlikely, economists say, that President Nicolas Maduro's government would do away completely with currency controls, first introduced by his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, in 2003 to curb capital flight.
The decision appears, however, to be a sign that Maduro's government recognizes the impact of the controls on Venezuela's economy, which is in its fifth year of recession, with inflation expected to hit 1 million percent this year. 
The pro-government assembly agreed to revoke the law that criminalizes money exchange and eliminate an article from the law governing the Venezuelan Central Bank, to allow the sale and purchase of foreign currency.
The vice president for the economy, Tareck El Aissami, said Venezuelans would be able to go to state-authorized exchange houses to exchange money in a ""transparent, legal and safe manner.""
""This is a big opportunity. It is a fresh start,"" said El Aissami in a speech at the pro-government assembly to propose the reform. He did not provide details on how an exchange rate would be determined.
The political opposition dismissed the reform as an attempt by the government to take control of the remittances on which many Venezuelans depend, given the minimum wage is now worth just $1.50 a month, barely enough to buy a carton of eggs.
""They have said many times they will relax currency controls, which will solve all the chaos they have caused, but they have never managed to do it,"" opposition lawmaker and economist Angel Alvarado said.
The Constituent Assembly was created last year to override the opposition-controlled congress, drawing condemnation from the United States, European Union and other Latin American countries.
The currency reform occurs after years of prosecution of people who operated in a parallel market for dollars used by most Venezuelans to bypass the official currency exchange platforms, which offer far lower rates.
The government currently fixes sales of dollars at an official rate of 172,800 bolivars per dollar, well below the black market rate of around 3.8 million bolivars per dollar. 
Venezuela's bolivar currency has fallen 99.99 percent against the dollar on the black market since Maduro came to power in April 2013. A $100 purchase of bolivars then would now be worth just less than a single U.S. cent.
Maduro blames the crisis on a ""economic war"" led by opposition leaders with the help of Washington, which last year levied several rounds of sanctions against his administration.
The government has also said it plans to remove five zeroes from the bolivar currency later this month to keep up with inflation.

The upbeat labor market report comes a day ahead of the closely-watched nonfarm payrolls report expected to show the U.S. economy created 193,000 jobs in July.
The dollar's advance was helped by a slump in the pound as the Bank of England raised rates but signaled that it was in no hurry to raise rates again, warning that a lack of progress on Brexit talks could impact monetary policy decisions.

669,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 05:55AM ET</span>","Light touch: China lets yuan slide run into fifth month, no floor in sight","By Winni Zhou and Marius Zaharia
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's uncharacteristically laissez-faire approach to its swiftly declining currency is spawning market speculation that the yuan is part of an economic stimulus toolkit and will be allowed to weaken more over the rest of the year.
July saw an 8 percent erosion in the yuan's  value against the U.S. dollar since April, marking its worst 4-month fall on record. Losses were driven by concerns over rising U.S. interest rates, falling Chinese yields and the heated Sino-U.S. tariff row, with latest reports suggesting Washington is planning to slap even higher tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese imports. 
Yet, unlike in the previous bout of yuan weakness from August 2015 to late 2016, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has hardly done anything to contain the currency's fall. Its daily fixings for the yuan, which determine the day's trading band, have been strictly in line with moves in other currencies. 
""I do think the trade war and escalating tension will mean China's net exports will shrink and therefore the yuan will depreciate against the dollar,"" said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING in Hong Kong.
Pang expects the yuan to weaken to 7 per dollar by the end of the year, another 2.5 percent depreciation from Wednesday's spot levels around 6.82.
The tightly managed currency has fallen less against a broadly stronger dollar this year than some of its emerging market peers, including currencies of India and Indonesia, which indicates Beijing is not deliberately devaluing the yuan. 
Those drawing parallels to 2015-2016, when China burnt through a trillion dollars of reserves to stem resident capital outflows and put a floor under the currency, acknowledge that stringent capital controls in place since then effectively preclude a similar crisis.
""It really boils down to the question of how much will they want and how much will they allow the renminbi to depreciate,"" bond house PIMCO's global economic advisor, Joachim Fels, told a conference last week, adding he didn't think the authorities had any firm thresholds for the yuan. 
""I think they're looking at the currency mainly as a tool to support economic growth. Our view is that yes, we're likely to see further depreciation but we think it will be in a very controlled and gradual fashion.""

TRADE WAR TACTIC
Even those market participants who suspect that Beijing is using the yuan as a weapon in its trade dispute with Trump, who has repeatedly accused China of manipulating its currency for advantages in trade, reckon it's difficult to estimate how far the weakness will run.
China and the U.S. have already imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on about $34 billion of each other's goods. Trump has proposed further tariffs on $16 billion of Chinese imports, and a threat of tariffs on the entire $500 billion-or-so of goods imported from China still stands.
A source familiar with the Trump administration's plans said on Tuesday the tariffs on about $200 billion of Chinese imports could be raised to 25 percent from the 10 percent initially proposed, in order to pressure Beijing into making trade concessions.
Separately, Bloomberg reported, citing sources representatives of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He have been speaking privately as they seek to restart negotiations. 
Chinese imports from America are only about a fourth of that amount, so a weaker yuan could well be part of Beijing's retaliatory strategy.
A weak currency also fits well into an ongoing monetary policy loosening in the world's second largest economy. Policymakers have allowed market yields to fall, pumped cash into the banking system and prodded banks to lend to smaller firms as part of measures to prevent a sharp slowdown in growth even as they wean the economy off its addiction to huge levels of unproductive debt.
In a somewhat surprising move, state-run banks also pushed currency swaps down sharply last week, rendering the yuan stronger in the forwards market than spot. While that made it dirt cheap for investors to borrow and short-sell the yuan, traders said the intent was merely to signal easy policy.
""They are indirectly lowering interest rates,"" said ING's Pang. ""I don't think this will directly relate to whether the yuan will appreciate or depreciate...because we are not talking about free capital outflows and inflows.""
Ken Cheung, senior Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong, expects the yuan could rebound to around the 6.7 to 6.8 per dollar levels if trade negotiations resume.

""The overall sentiment remains bearish as the market does not seem to buy trade talks now.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar edged up against the yuan and growth-leveraged currencies on Wednesday after a source familiar with the Trump administration's plans said the White House was about to propose higher tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports.
The news came as a survey showed China's factory sector grew at the slowest pace in eight months in July as export orders declined yet again.
The dollar added 0.4 percent to 6.8306 yuan  after reports circulated President Donald Trump would propose tariffs of 25 percent, instead of 10 percent, in an announcement that could come as early as Wednesday.
The yuan has now fallen for four months in a row and China's central bank on Wednesday set the currency at its weakest since May last year.
The Australian dollar, often used as a proxy for China plays, dipped 0.2 percent to $0.7412 . Against a basket of currencies the dollar added 0.15 percent to 94.631, while the euro was sidelined at $1.1681 (EUR=).
""The jury is out on whether this is yet another 'clever' negotiating tactic by the U.S., but the market has reacted as expected and risk appetite looks set once again to pull back over the next couple of trading sessions,"" said Nick Twidale, COO at Rakuten Securities.
The dollar was also holding the whip hand against the yen after Tuesday's pledge by the Bank of Japan to keep rates extremely low for an extended period.
The dollar was poised at 111.92 yen  as bulls girded for another test of resistance around 112.00.
""Relative to other major central banks, the BoJ is now decisively the last cab off the easy policy rank,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank.
""Higher inflation remains the BoJ's main priority and therefore we suspect the Bank will be at pains to make sure its actions don't result in a stronger yen."" 
HIKES AHOY
In contrast, solid U.S. economic growth is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on track for another two hikes this year as it concludes its policy meeting later in the day.
Data out Tuesday showed U.S. consumer spending increased solidly in June even as wage growth stayed restrained.
The core PCE index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, rose 1.9 percent from a year earlier for a third straight month, near the Fed's two-percent inflation target.
""Though the tariff tantrum ramped up a bit since the last FOMC confab, the core of the Fed is thus far unconvinced that this warrants any material shift in the outlook,"" said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets.
""Our core view remains that the Fed is poised to raise the funds rate by additional 50 basis points this year and another 100 basis points in 2019.""
The Bank of England holds its policy meeting on Thursday and markets are pricing in a near-90 percent chance of a quarter-point hike in rates.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Japanese yen weakened against the dollar on Tuesday after the central bank pledged to keep interest rates low and adopted a forward guidance model to strengthen its commitment for its massive policy stimulus.
The yen slipped 0.2 percent against the dollar at 111.25 yen  in a volatile session and rebounding off an early low of 110.75 yen hit in Asia.
Japan's commitment to keep policy settings at record low levels reassured market participants who were wary the Bank of Japan would signal an end to years of policy stimulus and encouraged investors to snap up relatively higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar .
""What the Bank of Japan has done today has signaled a cap on global bond yields and indicated the appetite for risk may have some more room to run,"" said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING in London.
The BOJ pledged to maintain its short-term interest rate target at minus 0.1 percent and decided to guide 10-year JGB yields around zero percent.
But the bank also said it would allow long-term rates to fluctuate depending on economic and price developments, and conduct its bond purchases more flexibly.
German and French government bond yields dropped 3 to 4 basis points after the Bank of Japan move and the euro (EUR=EBS) hopped a fifth of a percent higher at $1.17230.
Inflation and GDP data in Europe will be the key data points in focus for the session with any upside surprise likely to stir expectations of hawkish comments from the European Central Bank.

Yen volatility neared a seven-week high ahead of the central bank’s decision on Tuesday. Media reports have suggested a range of possible outcomes.

678,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 11:56AM ET</span>",Dollar drivers: what's boosting the buck?,"By Saikat Chatterjee and Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - This year's dollar rally is three months old and, despite some clouds over the U.S. growth outlook, the gains may have a bit further to go.
Since mid-April, the dollar has risen nearly 6 percent against a basket of currencies, hurting emerging markets and inflicting losses on speculators who had bet the currency would extend its 10 percent fall from 2017.
Their bets paid off in the first quarter when the dollar tanked nearly 4 percent. But since then, signs of faltering growth elsewhere in the globe and then the trade war outbreak have pushed capital towards the United States. 
Many remain convinced the dollar has had its day, noting U.S. economic growth is likely to have peaked. But most of the analysts polled by Reuters see the dollar's allure lasting another six months.
""The dollar outlook is the trillion-dollar question in foreign exchange markets today as there are a lot of drivers at play simultaneously,"" said Borut Miklavcic, CIO at LindenGrove Capital, a London-based fund.
Below are some of the key factors driving the dollar. 
(For a graphic on 'Central bank policy gap gives yield advantage to U.S.' click https://reut.rs/2JTQxW7)
1/ MIND THE GAP
Interest rate differentials are big drivers for currencies. That driver seemed to have broken down last year when the dollar fell, despite higher interest rates and bond yields than Europe or Japan. Now the link may be restored.
In early 2018, encouraging European data fostered a view of synchronised economic recovery that could lead to interest rate rises. But that view has dissipated - the Bank of England played down rate rise expectations in April and a hike this week is unlikely to be followed up with more.
The European Central Bank also pledged in June to hold down interest rates until past next summer. And few expect the Bank of Japan to signal any retreat this week from its stimulus. 
But the U.S. economy is growing strongly, even if the second quarter's 4 percent-plus rate is the peak. Nevertheless it should continue to expand faster than peers. 
""The gap in growth between the U.S. and the rest of the world has increased, as has the gap in central bank policy,"" said Roberto Coronado, senior portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments. 
In comparison, the European Commission has trimmed 2018 euro zone growth forecasts to 2.1 percent from 2.3 percent. Japan's economy is expected to rebound modestly in the June quarter after contracting in the first quarter. 
""The U.S. economy is pointing towards a strong rebound in Q2 while in the rest of the world there is nothing pointing to a rebound,"" Coronado added. 
(For a graphic on 'U.S. companies repatriated about $300bn in Q1 2018' click https://reut.rs/2mKlZwM)
3/ REPATRIATION
Repatriation flows from U.S. companies holding large amounts in dollars overseas may be helping support the currency.
New U.S. regulation whereby companies are taxed on profits accumulated abroad, irrespective of where the cash is held has encouraged such companies to start ""repatriating"" an estimated $3.3 trillion of funds stashed overseas.
U.S. balance of payments data shows some $300 billion of such earnings was repatriated in the first quarter. Those flows did not boost the greenback, because the money was believed largely to be in dollars already, but that may change in coming quarters.
""We expect a pick-up in non-dollar repatriation and a sustained increase in net direct investment flows to support the dollar,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said. 
(For a graphic on 'U.S. economy likely peaked in Q2 2018' click https://reut.rs/2JSYLxG)
3/TRADE WINDS
Protectionism may also be playing a role. The United States, whose exports amount to 12 percent of its annual gross domestic product, looks less vulnerable to trade war than, say, Germany, which has an export-GDP ratio around 45 percent.
The figures reflect gross exports as a percentage of annual output and not net trade. Click the following link for an interactive version of this chart: https://tmsnrt.rs/2LBsdxS
China's ratio is 20 percent and its annual exports to the United States are worth $500 billion. But U.S. exports to China are $130 billion. This relative insulation may offer another incentive to buy the greenback.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategist Hans Redeker predicts the dollar rally will end soon, but acknowledges ""protectionism is likely to impact the rest of the world first."" So ""the first-order effect could be dollar-positive, but ultimately net dollar weakness would be the second-order impact,"" he said.
(For a graphic on 'Dollar rally hits emerging markets' click https://reut.rs/2LG13Fd)
4/ EM OUTFLOWS
Support for the dollar has also come from the emerging market capital exodus. As U.S. interest rates rise and China eases policy, trade-driven emerging economies have seen capital outflows.
Emerging markets saw $14 billion in outflows in May and June, the Institute for International Finance estimates. It provided no July figures, but emerging funds have seen more outflows this month. Ordinarily, this cash would have gone to safe-haven Japanese yen or Swiss franc, but this year higher-yielding U.S. assets are benefiting. 
5/ POSITIONS
But markets could soon turn wary if the build-up in dollar long positions tempts investors to take profits.
Long dollar bets are at the biggest in more than a year and a half, with bets tripling from April lows though they remain some way off the November 2014 record. 
The latest increase in dollar long positions came as the dollar index retreated one percent from one-year highs.
Derivatives also paint a slightly more circumspect picture, with three-month risk reversals -- a ratio of calls to puts -- for the dollar against the yen  and the euro  also below June highs.

680,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 04:12AM ET</span>",Big week for currency markets as central banks meet,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - Major currencies stuck to familiar ranges on Monday as investors shied away from taking out big positions ahead of a flurry of crucial economic data and central bank monetary policy meetings this week. 
With the Bank of Japan ending a two-day meeting on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve concluding its meeting on Wednesday and the Bank of England expected to raise interest rates on Thursday, investors are preparing for a busy week that could set the near-term course for currencies.
The European Central Bank's reaffirmation last week that rates would remain low through the summer of 2019 hurt the euro and the currency remained stuck around $1.1649 (EUR=) against the dollar in early European trading.
Euro zone inflation data due later on Monday and on Tuesday could help shake the currency out of its recent narrow range, analysts said, although investors appear reluctant to make large bets for now.
""It will be an active week, there is a lot of event risk,"" said Manuel Oliveri, analyst at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR). ""Markets are pretty much range-bound and it doesn't look like there is much motivation to enter big positions.""
Oliveri said that positioning data showed dollar net long positions remained at their largest for several months, and the greenback's recent strength was vulnerable to a reversal of those positions.
The dollar index (DXY) against a basket of six major currencies stood little changed at 94.717 after dipping slightly on Friday. 
Upbeat second quarter U.S. gross domestic product data failed to lift the greenback, as markets had mostly priced in strong figures.
More important will be data that incorporates July, which is when tariffs against Chinese goods were activated.
The U.S. currency was 0.1 percent higher at 111.10 yen , with markets preparing to see whether the BOJ is considering taking steps to make its massive stimulus program more sustainable.
Talk about what the BOJ might do includes the central bank possibly adjusting its yield-curve control and exchange-traded fund (ETF) buying schemes. The dollar has eased back from a six-month high above 113.00 yen scaled on July 19 after such speculation.
""While various speculations are being made over the BOJ, we believe they will stand pat on monetary policy. The focal point for us is whether the BOJ hints at future policy change,"" said Shin Kadota, senior strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Tokyo.
""Opinion about potential actions on Tuesday varies greatly, and the meeting could trigger a market reaction, no matter what the outcome is.""
The Chinese yuan continued to weaken. In offshore markets it fell to as low as 6.85 yuan per dollar , close to its one-year low reached last week, before settling around 6.833.
The yuan has been under relentless pressure in recent months because of nervousness about what a dispute over trade with the United States will mean for the Chinese economy.

The Australian dollar declined 0.1 percent to $0.7397 , while the Canadian dollar fell 0.1 percent to C$1.3065 .

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was trading at 94.49 by 03:04 AM ET (07:04 AM GMT), almost unchanged for the day, after edging lower on Friday.
The greenback dipped but held near one-week highs Friday as data showing that the U.S. economy grew at the fastest rate in four years in the second quarter was offset by concerns that trade tensions would act as a drag on growth in the second half of the year.
The data underlined expectations for the Federal Reserve to continue hiking rates this year, but economists are concerned that the surge in second quarter growth may not be sustainable.
Market participants were looking ahead to the conclusion of the Fed’s two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, where it will probably flag up its third rate hike this year in September.
The Bank of Japan is to meet on Tuesday, amid speculation that it is considering changes to its massive asset purchase program.
The Bank of England is to deliver its interest rate decision on Thursday, with most analysts expecting a quarter point rate increase.

""Our base case scenario is for the BOJ to make no policy change. But there is increasing speculation the BOJ may tweak its yield curve control settings in part because of lower bank profitability and muted inflation in Japan,"" Elias Haddad, senior currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, wrote in a note. 
Analysts also believed the BOJ could also modify its annual objective of accumulating 80 trillion yen ($720 billion) of Japanese government bonds, as well as potentially lifting its target yield for 10-year JGBs.

683,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 29, 2018 09:20PM ET</span>",Pound Optimism Ebbs as Brexit Gloom Overwhelms BOE Hike Prospect,"(Bloomberg) -- Pound bulls just lost some of their swagger.
Long-standing optimists  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA, BBVA (MC:BBVA) and  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV all cut their sterling calls in recent days with still no sign of a resolution to Brexit uncertainty. While the French and Spanish banks still see the U.K. currency strengthening from current levels, the Dutch one now forecasts it will fall to as low as $1.27 -- a level not seen in more than a year -- in the coming months.
“Our bullish outlook at the start of the year was predicated on lower Brexit uncertainty and issues like the Irish backstop having been resolved,” said ING analyst Viraj Patel. “The fact that we’re still debating that and still questioning whether a transition may or may not go ahead is a huge disappointment.”
The pound fell 0.7 percent against the dollar this month even as markets priced in an interest-rate increase this week by the Bank of England. With just 12 weeks to go until the U.K.’s and European Union’s target date to have a Brexit deal in place, negotiations suffered yet another setback Friday as the bloc rejected British Prime Minister Theresa May’s latest customs plan.
ING now expects the pound in the $1.27-$1.28 area in the third quarter, compared with a previous forecast for $1.34-$1.35. Credit Agricole sees it at $1.37 in the fourth quarter, from $1.38 previously. BBVA cut its third- and fourth-quarter estimates to $1.32 and $1.38, from $1.37 and $1.44 respectively.
One-and-Done
Positioning data shows it’s not just the strategists who are struggling to be positive on sterling. Even amid elevated expectations for an imminent rate increase, the market is close to its most bearish in almost a year on the pound-dollar exchange rate.
This can partly be put down to the fact investors aren’t anticipating a rate hike this week to be followed by more monetary tightening in the coming months. Money-market prices show only 40 basis points of further increases priced over the next three years beyond the expected Aug. 2 move.
But for now, politics is outweighing the economics. Credit Agricole cut its pound forecasts on the view that the risk of a no-deal Brexit was growing and that an agreement between the U.K. and the EU will come “only after a period of heightened political uncertainty and growing fears about a no-deal Brexit,” the bank’s head of Group-of-10 currency research Valentin Marinov wrote in a note.
It would take either a positive surprise from U.K. economic data or a drop in domestic political risks to make ING go bullish on sterling again, Patel said. With both the U.K. Parliament and Brussels in recess, the uncertainty on Britain’s future path is likely to continue into October, he said.

684,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2018 03:10PM ET</span>",Iran currency extends record fall as U.S. sanctions loom,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's currency hit a new record low on Sunday, dropping past 100,000 rials to the U.S. dollar as Iranians brace for Aug. 7 when Washington is due to reimpose a first lot of economic sanctions.
In May, the United States pulled out of a 2015 deal between world powers and Tehran under which international sanctions were lifted in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.
Washington decided to reimpose sanctions upon its withdrawal, accusing it of posing a security threat. It has told countries they must halt imports of Iranian oil from Nov. 4 or face U.S. financial measures.
On Sunday, the rial plunged to 112,000 on the unofficial market, down from about 97,500 rials on Saturday, according to foreign exchange website Bonbast.com. Other websites said the dollar was exchanged between 108,500 and 116,000 rials. 
The rial has lost about half of its value since April because of a weak economy, financial difficulties at local banks and heavy demand for dollars among Iranians who fear the effects of sanctions.
The central bank blamed ""enemies"" for the fall of the currency and a rapid rise in the prices of gold coins and the judiciary said 29 people had been arrested on charges that carry the death penalty. 
""The recent developments in the foreign exchange and gold markets are largely due to a conspiracy by enemies with the aim of exacerbating economic problems and causing public anxiety,"" the central bank said in a statement read on state television.
Judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei told state television: ""29 people have been arrested for economic disruption and will be soon put on trial ... More may be arrested tonight and tomorrow.""
""Many of them face the charge of 'spreading corruption on earth',"" Ejei said, referring to a capital offence under Iran's Islamic laws. 
Besides the currency fall, the expected return of sanctions has triggered street protests including by bazaar traders usually loyal to the Islamist rulers, and a public outcry over alleged profiteering and corruption.
On Saturday, Ejei said 18 people had been arrested over alleged profiteering from foreign exchange dealings and the illegal importing of luxury cars.
U.S. President Donald Trump has called the agreement one of the worst deals ever negotiated but in a bid to salvage the accord, Iran’s European partners in the deal are preparing a package of economic measures. 
But France said this month it was unlikely European powers could put the package together before November.
On Aug. 7, Washington will reimpose sanctions on Iran's purchase of U.S. dollars, its trade in gold and precious metals and its dealings with metals, coal and industrial-related software.
Sanctions also will be reapplied to U.S. imports of Iranian carpets and foodstuffs and on certain related financial transactions.

Iran’s oil exports could fall by as much as two-thirds by this year due to sanctions, straining oil markets amid supply outages elsewhere.

The dollar dipped against a currency basket on Friday as data showing that the U.S. economy grew at the fastest rate in four years in the second quarter was offset by concerns that trade tensions would act as a drag on growth in the second half of the year.
The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 4.1% the Commerce Department reported, accelerating from 2.2% in the first three months of the year. Compared to the second quarter of 2017, the economy grew by a slower than anticipated 2.8%.
The data underlined expectations for the Fed to continue hiking rates this year, but economists are concerned that the surge in second quarter growth may not be sustainable.
Import duties could dampen consumer spending and discourage business investment.
The dollar eased from one-week highs against a currency basket following the report, with the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, dipping 0.11% to 94.47 in late trade, paring its weekly gain to 0.24%.
The euro was a touch higher, with EUR/USD rising 0.13% to 1.1657. The euro ended the previous session down 0.72% against the dollar after the European Central Bank reiterated that rates will remain on hold until summer 2019, highlighting the widening monetary policy divergence with the Fed.
The yen also pushed higher, with USD/JPY slipping 0.18% to 111.02 ahead of the upcoming BoJ meeting reports after reports last week that policymakers are considering how to make its massive stimulus program more sustainable.

686,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 05:20PM ET</span>","Speculators lift net long USD bets, highest since Jan 2017: CFTC, Reuters","By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Speculators raised bullish bets on the U.S. dollar to the largest position since January 2017, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The value of the net long dollar position was $20.33 billion in the week ended July 24, up from $18.41 billion the previous week. Speculators were net long dollars for a sixth straight week, after being short for 48 consecutive weeks.
To be long a currency means traders believe it will rise in value, while being short points to a bearish bias.
U.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.
In a wider measure of dollar positioning  that includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian ruble, the U.S. dollar posted a net long position valued at $21.85 billion, compared with a net long position valued at $19.74 billion a week earlier.
U.S. dollar sentiment has improved over the last few months due to an improving economic backdrop, rising interest rates - which have propped up demand - and U.S. protectionism. 
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six rival currencies, fell on Friday after U.S. GDP data came in softer than expected, but some analysts said the case for owning dollars remains good. 
""Interest rate differentials continue to support the U.S. dollar. We saw GDP in the U.S. reach 4.1 percent, which is higher than any of the other major currencies. Those economic fundamentals keep the dollar at a premium to its rivals,"" said Greg Michalowski, director of technical analysis at ForexLive.com in Scottsdale, Arizona.
The U.S. government reported gross domestic product grew at a 4.1 percent annualized pace in the second quarter, accelerating from a revised 2.2 percent clip in the first three months of the year. 
Escalating tensions over trade policy between the United States and many of its key trading partners had helped the greenback, with investors betting the dollar would gain at the expense of emerging market currencies, which are dependent on commodity exports. 
The trade detente reached by U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker announced on Wednesday caused the dollar to weaken. That development is likely to be reflected in next week's CFTC data. 

Yen net short bets, meanwhile, grew to 73,769 contracts, the largest short position since March, CFTC data showed.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar was little changed against its U.S. counterpart on Friday as the loonie held on to this week's gains even after data showed the U.S. economy expanded at its fastest clip in nearly four years.
At 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar  was trading 0.1 percent higher at C$1.3061 to the greenback, or 76.56 U.S. cents.
The currency, which on Wednesday touched its highest level in nearly six weeks at C$1.3025, traded in a narrow range of C$1.3041 to C$1.3080.
For the week, the loonie is on track to rise 0.7 percent. It has been boosted by stronger-than-expected domestic data and easing of trans-Atlantic trade tensions.
Canada runs a current account deficit, so its economy could be hurt if the flow of trade or capital slows.
""The big takeaway this week has been the Canadian dollar outperforming,"" said Amo Sahota, director at Klarity FX in San Francisco.
Penetration by USD-CAD this week of a rising trend line since April has set the market up for additional Canadian dollar appreciation over the coming weeks, Sahota said.
Canada is in talks with Mexico and the United States to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Mexico and the United States agreed on Thursday to step up talks on updating NAFTA in hopes of reaching an agreement on major issues by August.
Additional ""positive noises"" on NAFTA could boost expectations for another Bank of Canada interest rate increase as soon as October, said Sahota.
The central bank has raised its benchmark interest rate twice this year to sit at 1.50 percent. Money markets see a greater-than 60 percent chance of an October hike. 
Speculators have cut bearish bets on the Canadian dollar for the second straight week, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations showed. As of July 24, net short positions had fallen to 44,511 contracts from 47,484 a week earlier.
The U.S. dollar (DXY) slipped against a basket of currencies as the robust U.S. data failed to erase worries that trade frictions would be a drag in the second half of 2018.
U.S. crude oil futures (CLc1) settled 1.3 percent lower at $68.69 a barrel. Oil is one of Canada's major exports.
Canadian government bond prices were lower across the yield curve, with the 10-year (CA10YT=RR) falling 3 Canadian cents to yield 2.296 percent.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.14% to 94.44. The dollar had traded as high as 94.71 intraday.
Gross domestic product increased at a 4.1% annual rate in the April-June period, the Commerce Department said Friday in its first estimate, in line with economists' forecast.
The strong GDP data was driven by a surge in consumer spending aided by tax cuts, but was partially offset by negative contributions from private inventory investment and residential fixed investment.
Analysts questioned the sustainability of growth, however, as the benefits from fiscal stimulus on economic growth are expected to wane next year.
""While we expect the economy to remain strong in the near-term, we see growth slowing sometime next year as fiscal stimulus fades and tighter monetary conditions begin to bite,""  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) said in a note to clients Friday.
The subdued session for the dollar helped the euro steady from a slump on Thursday, when European Central Bank President Mario Draghi reiterated that rates would remain on hold until next year.
EUR/USD rose 0.16% to $1.1662, but the pair remained on track to post a weekly loss.
GBP/USD fell 0.01% to $1.3108, while USD/CAD fell 0.05% to C$1.3067.
USD/JPY fell 0.38% to Y110.81 as traders remained cautions on initiating large positions in the pair as the Bank of Japan is expected to tweak policy at its meeting next week.

Gross domestic product registered a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 4.1% growth in the second quarter, its fastest rate of growth since the third quarter of 2014.
Trade tensions lingered, however, with some analysts observing that the second-quarter growth is unsustainable given trade tensions between the U.S. and other countries.

Strong economic growth would support expectations for the Federal Reserve to continue gradually increasing interest rates.

That’s the forecast from Morgan Stanley strategists, who say the greenback is “topping out” and will face sustained pressure as early as next month.
There are plenty of factors that could drive a selloff, they say. These include comments from President Donald Trump on currencies, weaker U.S. economic survey indicators, Chinese economic measures and potential tweaks to Bank of Japan policy.
“The USD has peaked and is due to reenter its secular downtrend soon,” Morgan Stanley strategists including Hans Redeker wrote in a note Thursday. “Markets are linking rising risk aversion with USD strength; we think the consensus is wrong.”
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is down 0.5 percent in July following a three-month rally. This year’s gains have caught off guard some investors who had crowded into bearish positions after last year’s 8.5 percent slump.
Hedge funds and money managers have now swung the other way: they’re the most bullish on the greenback since February 2017, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.

Chinese authorities have so far refrained from heavy intervention to stem the yuan’s plunge, sparking speculation they prefer a weaker currency to blunt the impact of a trade war with the U.S. The yuan’s slump on a trade-weighted basis will offset the drag on Chinese growth from the first two rounds of tariffs imposed by the U.S., according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
Despite the weakness in the spot market, traders have refrained from shorting the currency with derivatives. Guo Shuqing, the Communist Party chief at the People’s Bank of China, warned on July 5 that investors betting against the yuan over the past three decades ""eventually bore considerable losses.""
Twelve-month forward points on the offshore yuan -- or the spread between the spot rate and the forwards outright -- have tumbled to the lowest since 2011, reflecting a lack of bearish trades even though the cost of shorting has become cheap. The three-month risk reversal, which indicates bearishness in the options market, is one-fourth of the level seen in 2015.
""Investors understand that the People’s Bank of China doesn’t plan to intervene and have gotten used to higher two-way volatility,"" said Ken Cheung, senior Asian currency strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd.
The offshore yuan lost 0.97 percent on Thursday after climbing 0.32 percent earlier in the day.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar was firm against its peers on Friday, having regained traction as the euro slid sharply after the European Central Bank kept to its planned timetable to move away from its accommodative monetary policy.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback's strength against a basket of six major currencies, stood little changed at 94.743 (DXY). It had risen 0.4 percent overnight to pull away from a two-week low of 94.084.
The euro was virtually flat at $1.1643 (EUR=).
The single currency had sunk more than 0.7 percent the previous day after the ECB said it would stay on course to end its 2.6 trillion euro stimulus program this year and keep rates at a record low level through the summer of 2019.
While the euro's downturn provided the dollar with a significant lift, the U.S. currency was seen to be enjoying support from other quarters as well.
""The dollar is higher across the board and this reflects the lift it is enjoying from fundamental factors, notably higher U.S. yields and higher Wall Street shares amid improving risk appetite,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""The dollar will remain caught between the lift from such fundamental factors and downward pressure from political factors, such as President Trump's attempts to keep dollar strength in check.""
The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield (US10YT=RR) hovered near a six-week high of 2.984 percent scaled overnight as traders braced for a potentially strong reading of U.S. gross domestic product data, set for release later on Friday.
The U.S. currency was 0.05 percent higher at 111.15 yen .
The dollar was slightly lower against the yen for the week, during which it pulled away from a six-month high above 113 yen scaled on July 19.
The dollar's retreat came after U.S. President Donald Trump expressed displeasure over the currency's strength and amid speculation that the Bank of Japan could scaled back its massive monetary stimulus soon.
The pound was 0.05 percent lower at $1.3104 . It had dropped 0.6 percent overnight as a stronger dollar and mounting uncertainty over Brexit negotiations offset the positive impact of bets on a Bank of England interest rate hike next week. [GBP/]
The Australian dollar  was a shade higher at $0.7381. The Aussie, often seen as a liquid proxy of China-related trades, had fallen 1 percent the previous day amid a drop in Chinese equities.

A rout of the euro prompted traders to buy the greenback after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi reiterated that rates would remain on hold until next year.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.46% to 94.41.
Draghi said Thursday that there was no need to ""modify or add new language"" to the bank's forward guidance on rates and reaffirmed plans to keep rates unchanged “through the summer of 2019.”
Draghi added that market expectations of rate hikes were ""very well aligned"" with the bank's own projections.
That all but confirmed investor expectations that ECB is unlikely to hike interest until October 2019, pressuring the euro to drop against the greenback.
EUR/USD fell 0.54% to $1.1665.
A trio of reports showing weak U.S. economic data did little to limit the greenback's advance as investors remained optimistic on domestic economic growth ahead of second-quarter GDP data due Friday.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday core durable goods orders rose 0.4% last month, missing economists' forecast for a 0.5%.
The U.S. Department of Labor, meanwhile, reported Thursday that initial jobless claims increased by 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 217,000 for the week ended July 21, missing economists’ forecast for a drop to 215,000.
The goods trade deficit -- which measures the gap between what the United States imports and what it exports -- widened to $68.33 billion in June.
The greenback was also supported by a slump in the pound as Brexit-related angst continued to weigh.
GBP/USD fell 0.48% to $1.3127. The pair remains well above the lows seen last week, when it dropped below $1.30.

The currency fell as much as 2.3 percent as the White House confirmed an Associated Press report that U.S. Vice President Mike Pence threatened sanctions unless Brunson is released. The lira had gotten some relief yesterday when Turkey, a NATO ally of the U.S., decided to place Brunson under house arrest after almost two years in jail. Pence said that while the status change was a welcome step, it was insufficient.
Pence Warns Turkey U.S. to Impose Sanctions If Pastor Not Freed
The standoff is an unwelcome complication for Turkey at a time when the nation is grappling with financial stress that includes accelerating inflation, a widening current-account deficit and investor perceptions that the central bank isn’t doing enough to shore up the lira. The currency is this year’s worst performer versus the dollar after the Argentine peso, weakening almost 22 percent.
The lira slid 1.4 percent to 4.8407 per dollar as of 11:15 a.m. in New York. The Borsa Istanbul 100 Index erased earlier gains as Turkish state-run lender sank 3.2 percent -- following yesterday’s 12 percent surge. The iShares MSCI Turkey ETF fell as much as 4 percent, before paring gains.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro held at a three-day high on Thursday as concerns about a global trade war eased after the United States and the European Union agreed to begin talks on lowering tariffs.
Following talks on Wednesday with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, U.S. President Donald Trump said they had agreed to ""work together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods.""
However, the moves in the single currency (EUR=EBS) was far more subdued than equities, where auto stocks surged 2 percent, and bond yields edged higher as investors waited for the fine print to emerge on the trade discussions.
""The one thing we have learned from the last 18 months of Trump’s gyrating trade policies is that whatever looks certain today is likely to be undermined tomorrow,"" Gavekal strategists said in a note.

The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.1738 (EUR=EBS), extending its rise after gaining 0.4 percent the previous day. Before the Trump-Juncker talks, the single currency slipped to a low of $1.1664.
The immediate focus for currency markets was the European Central Bank's policy decision due later on Thursday where investors will study comments by President Mario Draghi for any further hints on the pace of policy normalization.
However, another leg down on the Chinese currency after yesterday's bounce undermined broader risk appetite in the markets. The Chinese yuan  fell half a percent to 6.79.
A more than 6 percent drop in the value of the Chinese currency against the dollar since mid-June as trade tensions escalated has put pressure on export-oriented emerging markets.

(Reuters) - Investors raised bearish positions over the past two weeks on all emerging Asian currencies, according to a Reuters poll, as U.S. rate hike concerns and a global trade war kept regional units under pressure.
Asian currencies have been hobbled in the past two weeks as the U.S. dollar firmed due to more clarity on the Federal Reserve's rate stance and as trade war ructions caused capital to depart from the region. 
The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropped to a more than 48-1/2-year low for the week ended July 14 as the labor market strengthens further.
The lower unemployment figure, coupled with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's upbeat comments on the U.S. economy in his latest congressional testimony, has lent credence to expectations of more interest rate hikes this year.
The dollar index (DXY) touched its highest in over a year at 95.652 last Thursday before giving back some gains after U.S. President Donald Trump railed against the Fed's tightening policy.
In Asia, investors piled bearish bets on the Chinese yuan  to the highest on record, the Reuters poll of 11 respondents showed. 
Over the last two weeks, the currency has weakened about 1.48 percent. Trump said last Friday he was ready to impose tariffs on all $500 billion worth of imported goods from China. 
However, China said it has no intention to devalue the yuan to prop up exports.
Chinese state radio on Monday reported the country's cabinet signaling a shift to a more 'vigorous' fiscal policy featuring a corporate tax cut. 
The policy shift is aimed at addressing potential trade shocks and liquidity concerns which have cropped up as the country looks to ease fears of a debt bubble.
Bearish positions on the Taiwan dollar  rose the most, after those on the yuan. Taiwan's export-centric economy leaves it exposed to the potential fallout of a worsening global trade stand-off.
Indonesia's rupiah  saw bearish positions being ramped up to their highest since October 2015, as the currency slid to its lowest in about 33 months earlier this week.
Intervention in the country's bond and currency markets by Indonesia's central bank has appeared insufficient to stem a more-or-less consistent weakening of the rupiah.
In the poll, the Thai baht  saw short positions rising to their highest since mid-October 2016. The country's customs-cleared annual exports rose at a slower pace in June from the previous month, and less than forecast, commerce ministry data showed on Friday.
The Philippine peso  has the second highest level of bearish bets in the region, the poll found.
The IMF on Wednesday said it now expects the Philippines' current account deficit to rise to 1.5 percent of GDP by end-2018, compared with an earlier forecast of 0.3 percent, mainly due to increased imports of capital goods and raw materials.
Short positions on the Malaysian ringgit  were at their highest in a month, with any hopes for a rate hike being dealt a blow as the annual inflation rate in June slowed to its lowest since February 2015, after the government abolished a goods and services tax.
Economists see Malaysia's central bank holding its key interest rate steady at 3.25 percent for the rest of the year, with the possibility of an easing if inflation slows further. 
Short positions on the Indian rupee  and Singapore dollar  were also raised to the highest in a month. The Indian rupee touched an all-time low on Friday. 
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.

The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars. The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela will remove five zeroes from the bolivar currency rather than the three zeroes originally planned, President Nicolas Maduro said on Wednesday, in an effort to keep up with inflation projected to reach 1 million percent this year. 
The OPEC nation's economy has been steadily collapsing since the 2014 crash of oil prices left it unable to maintain its socialist economic system that for years provided lavish subsidies while enforcing strict price controls. 
Annual inflation in June topped 46,000 percent, according to the opposition-run Congress. The IMF said this week it could hit seven digits this year, putting it on par with the crises of Zimbabwe in the 2000s and Germany in the 1920s.
""The monetary reconversion will start on Aug. 20,"" Maduro said in a televised broadcast, showing new bills that are to be released next month.
He said the overhaul would tie the bolivar to the recently launched state-backed cryptocurrency called the petro, without offering details.
Cryptocurrency experts have said the petro suffers from a lack of credibility because of a lack of confidence in Maduro's government and the mismanagement of the country's existing national currency.
The government has said it is the victim of an ""economic war"" led by opposition leaders with the help of Washington, which last year levied several rounds of sanctions against Maduro's administration and a group of top officials.
The country's high inflation rate has made it nearly impossible to obtain cash.
Venezuela's minimum wage is now about the equivalent of $1 a
month, which has left citizens across the country unable to eat properly or obtain basic medical care - fueling an exodus of Venezuelans seeking to escape the economic crisis. 
The government had been prepared to cut three zeroes off the currency in June but postponed the measure at the request of banking industry leaders who said the financial system was not ready for the measure.
Maduro on Wednesday proposed an overhaul to the currency crimes law in order to improve the flow of foreign investments.
Economists routinely identify the exchange controls as a major hindrance to economic growth. The issue will be taken up by the country's all-powerful Constituent Assembly, Maduro said.

He also said he was transferring a concession bloc of the vast Orinoco heavy oil belt to the central bank, which he said would help shore up the bank's international reserves.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro edged higher on Wednesday ahead of a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker but gains were limited with investors cautious about a trade rift between the two powers.
Lack of clarity over where a brewing trade spat between the U.S. and Europe is heading kept most major currencies, including the U.S. dollar, range-bound on Wednesday as Juncker traveled to Washington for trade-focused talks with Trump.
The talks come after the U.S. imposed tariffs on European Union steel and aluminum and Trump's threats to extend those measures to EU-made cars.
""Risks remain tilted to the continuation of the tough rhetoric by the U.S. President,"" said, Chris Turner, head of currency strategy at ING in London.
""Given that the risk of auto tariffs is a well-known threat, any major breakthrough today may not be enough to materially affect risk appetite. Rather, we look for the FX markets to remain stable today,"" he added. 
The single currency (EUR=EBS) was up 0.1 percent at $1.1694. The dollar versus a basket of major currencies (DXY) traded broadly flat at 95.55.
Some are puzzled at how little the impending U.S. tariffs have budged the euro in recent weeks.
""The euro continues to stagnate in a sideways range despite the risk of a trade war becoming increasingly obvious ... and despite many political lapses on the part of the U.S. President,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategist Ulrich Leuchtmann, in Frankfurt.

708,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 12:56PM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar Rally Pauses as Pound Gains ,"Investing.com – The dollar rally paused Tuesday against its rivals as mixed U.S. economic data and a rise in the pound weighed on sentiment.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.02% to 94.40.
Preliminary U.S. manufacturing PMI for July topped expectations, while the services PMI  fell marginally short of forecasts. But the data indicated the economy remains on solid footing.
""The July survey data indicate that the US economy sustained strong growth momentum after what looks to have been a solid second quarter, representing a good start to the second half of 2018,"" Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said.
The strength of U.S. manufacturing was echoed by a regional survey on U.S. manufacturing growth, which also came in above economists' estimates.
The Richmond Fed manufacturing index fell 1 point to a reading of 20 in July. Any reading above zero indicates improving conditions.
The U.S. data, however, did little to derail investor expectation that the U.S. economy generated strong growth in the second quarter. Expectations for a bullish GDP print on Friday were strengthened somewhat as Fox Business Network reported that President Donald Trump has been telling associates that he expects the number around 4.8%.
Economists expect U.S. second-quarter GDP to come in at 4.1%.
A stronger pound, meanwhile, limited the dollar's recovery as British Prime Minister Theresa May said Tuesday she would lead Brexit negotiations with European Union.
GBP/USD rose 0.29% to $1.3140.
EUR/USD, meanwhile, struggled to hold gains to trade at $1.1683, down 0.08%, after bouncing from a session low of $1.1655 amid mixed EU services and manufacturing data.
The euro will likely be closely watched ahead of a meeting on trade between Trump, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and European Union Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the White House in Washington Wednesday.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.21% to 94.22 by 10:52 AM ET (14:52 GMT).
Expectations that the Federal Reserve will stick to plans for further gradual rate hikes this year as the economy continues to strengthen supported the outlook for the dollar.
The dollar has come under pressure after U.S. President Donald Trump launched an attack on the U.S. central bank last week, claiming that their plans to raise U.S. interest rates risked undermining his efforts at strengthening the economy.
Trump also claimed that tighter monetary policy was penalizing the U.S. by contributing to a stronger dollar.
The euro pushed higher, with EUR/USD rising 0.14% to 1.1707, up from an earlier low of 1.1655.
The euro’s gains were held in check after data showing that growth in the euro zone private sector slowed slightly this month, indicating that the region’s economy started the third quarter on a softer footing.
The pound rose to the best levels of the day, with GBP/USD climbing 0.34% to 1.3146 after British Prime Minister Theresa May said in a statement that she will lead Brexit negotiations with the European Union, while the Brexit department will instead focus on preparations for a no-deal Brexit.
The dollar was also lower against the yen, with USD/JPY down 0.27% to 111.03.
The Japanese currency had been boosted on Monday by reports that the Bank of Japan is actively discussing changes to its massive monetary stimulus program. The BoJ is due to hold its next policy meeting at the end of the month.
Elsewhere, the Turkish lira tumbled with USD/TRY jumping 3.03% to 4.8838 after the country’s central bank kept interest rates on hold, surprising financial markets which had widely expected a rate hike.
The decision added to concerns that Turkish President Recep Erdogan is undermining central bank independence, as he pushes for lower interest rates."
710,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 10:31AM ET</span>",Buy yen in crisis? Not this year,"By Tom Finn and Hideyuki Sano
LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - The trade is familiar to investors worldwide: in times of turmoil, rush for cover by buying the Japanese yen. 
This year a global trade row has erupted, Donald Trump has lamented the dollar's strength - ignoring a custom that U.S. presidents avoid openly interfering in financial markets - and the Chinese yuan has tumbled. 
And yet the yen has stayed resolutely weak, becoming the weakest of the G10 developed market currencies this month.
To view a graphic on Major currencies. month-to-date performance, click: https://reut.rs/2JQ8Zyz
The yen's safe-haven status is not in doubt, underpinned by Japan's nearly two trillion yen ($18 billion) monthly trade surplus. But without a massive world market shock to discourage Japanese investors from buying foreign assets, the yen is likely to stay weak - above all because the Bank of Japan lags behind its central bank peers in ending monetary stimulus.
Investors doubt the BOJ can aggressively reduce the stimulus measures as inflation remains well below target and corporate profits are recovering slowly.
The BOJ is debating policy changes to make its stimulus ""more sustainable"", sources told Reuters, but this pushed the yen up only briefly on Monday. 
""The Bank of Japan is still pursuing easing which is still prompting domestic investors to borrow yen and buy overseas assets,"" said Anton Eser, CIO at Legal and General Investment Management which manages 983 billion pounds ($1.29 trillion) in assets.
While U.S. interest rates have risen seven times since 2016 and the European Central Bank plans to wind down its bond purchases by end-2018, the BOJ is still buying local securities, albeit at a slower pace.
Japanese investors are therefore likely to keep pouring money into foreign assets, despite global market wobbles.
Their net purchases of foreign equities reached 1.5 trillion yen in June, the highest in nearly three years. Even as the trade row deepened, they bought 371 billion yen of overseas stocks during the first week of July.

HEDGE TRIMMING
However, Japanese funds are growing reluctant to hedge exposure to billions of dollars' of U.S. assets. 
""I suspect some investors are reducing currency hedge on their foreign bond investments,"" a senior trader at a major Japanese bank in Tokyo told Reuters, requesting anonymity.
Japanese fund managers buying 10-year U.S. Treasuries on a fully hedged basis now earn a slim 33 basis points in yield, compared with 50-80 bps last year. As the Federal Reserve keeps raising interest rates, even that yield advantage could vanish.
And a lack of demand for yen from investors in the currency forwards market would feed into falling spot market demand.
""Currency hedging costs have risen rapidly. Japanese investors have stopped hedging. That stops them buying the yen. The flow is for selling yen,"" said Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC in London.
Another source of yen selling is Japanese companies making acquisitions overseas due to lackluster economic growth and a shrinking population at home. Thomson Reuters data shows Japanese investors spent a record 13.0 trillion yen on foreign acquisitions in the first half of the year.
These included Takeda Pharmaceutical's (T:4502) $62 billion acquisition of London-listed drugmaker  Shire  Plc (L:SHP). 
Initially the deal helped to push the British pound up more than four percent against the yen in early-April, but in May traders started to buy dollars on news that Takeda's payment to Shire shareholders would be in dollars.

TRADE WINDS
Trade conflict would seem yen-positive by raising global market volatility. In fact, this is helping to push it down.
Japan is vulnerable to a trade war. Autos, for instance, comprise almost 30 percent of its exports to the United States and new U.S. tariffs could hurt Tokyo's vaunted trade surplus.
Also, as fund managers worldwide cut foreign investment holdings, much of this cash is going to U.S. markets instead of the ""safe havens"". The dollar is likely to benefit from a trade war due to the United States' lower reliance on exports.
""Rather than move into the Swiss franc or the Japanese yen, the widening interest rate differential in favor of the U.S. dollar is currently providing investors with a strong alternative,"" Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley said.
Global investors now hold their biggest overweight position in U.S. equities in 17 months, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's poll showed last week. Other equity holdings have fallen and allocations to Japan slid for the third time in four months.
Correlation has been high this year between Japanese stocks and the yen, with both losing ground, BAML's FX strategist Kamal Sharma noted. That's unusual because yen weakness usually boosts the Nikkei average (N225). 

""If U.S. share markets crumbled, then we would be in a different situation,"" the Tokyo-based trader said. ""But as long as Wall Street is in the risk-on mode, the dollar will be supported against the yen.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro slipped a quarter of a percent on Tuesday as investors warily eyed business activity data that will shed light on whether growing rhetoric over a trade war between the U.S. and its trading partners in recent weeks has dampened sentiment.
European data has stabilized after losing momentum earlier this year, but sentiment remained cautious with French PMI data easing slightly. Eurozone PMI data is due shortly and is also expected to slip. 
""Should the PMIs reflect a stronger than expected collapse today the trade conflict might increasingly become an issue for the euro as well,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) strategists said.
In early London trading, the single currency was down 0.3 percent at $1.1654. It hit a near two-week high in the previous session at $1.1750.
The Japanese yen trimmed most of its gains against its rivals on Monday as traders dampened expectations about whether the Bank of Japan will launch a fresh round of stimulus at a scheduled policy meeting next week.
Japan's central bank is debating changes to its interest-rate targets and stock-buying techniques, people familiar with the central bank's thinking told Reuters, sending bond yields and the yen rocketing higher on Monday.
The yen  was broadly flat against the dollar at 111.21 yen and a touch stronger against the euro (EURJPY=EBS) and sterling (GBPJPY=EBS).
Risk appetite was mostly firm across markets after Beijing vowed to pursue a more 'vigorous' fiscal policy, stepping up efforts to support growth amid rising economic headwinds.
Both the euro and sterling edged higher against the Swiss franc as investors bet that a fresh round of policy easing from China would send investors into higher-yielding assets.

However, expectations of further loosening in monetary conditions drove the offshore yuan down half a percent to a 13-month low of 6.8448 yuan per dollar, its lowest since June 2017.

Separately, China’s foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the country is not looking to boost its exports through devaluing the yuan. “The yuan's exchange rate is mainly determined by market supply and demand. It floats in both ways, which means there are ups and downs,” Geng said.
His comments came after U.S. President Donald Trump’s brickbats last Friday in a tweet, slamming China and the EU on deliberately controlling their currencies.
The Chinese yuan depreciated against the U.S. dollar as the USD/CNY pair saw an increase of 0.36% to 6.8177 on Monday.
Some investors believed that yuan will go further down.
Vladimir Signorelli, a macro-investment analyst at Bretton Woods Research, said “If the dollar keeps strengthening and gold goes below $1,200 an ounce, you should not be surprised to see the yuan go to seven plus. The correlation between them is that strong.”
Meanwhile, the dollar steadied on Tuesday after the sharp decline in the previous session as Trump told CNBC last Friday that he was “not thrilled” about the Federal Reserve’s decision on raising interest rates.
On early Saturday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin tried to ease fears of a currency war at the G-20 meeting, confirming the Fed’s independence, and saying that the government would not intrude.
Mitsuo Imaizumi, chief currency strategist at Daiwa Securities, said, “The U.S. economy is in a very healthy state overall. It is unimaginable the Federal Reserve would stop raising interest rates.”

That’s the take from strategists at State Street Bank & Trust and John R. Taylor, formerly head of what was once the world’s biggest currency hedge fund. Part of the support for that thesis includes expectations for robust U.S. growth (even if tit-for-tat tariffs play out) that will keep the Federal Reserve hiking rates. Against that backdrop, the dollar has gained almost 6 percent since mid-April.
Dollar bulls also took cheer Monday after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over the weekend moved to ease fears that trade disputes had brought on a currency war. The greenback reversed some of its losses from Friday, when Trump criticized China and the European Union in a tweet, accusing them of “manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower.”
“The dollar will become stronger and stronger, despite Trump’s efforts to keep it weak,” said Taylor, who runs Taylor Global Vision, which produces a newsletter on financial markets. “The Fed will keep tightening and the worsening deficits will keep Treasury supply increasing,” which will keep U.S. yields attractive to international investors, supporting the greenback.
Although the European Central Bank is on course to end its asset-purchase program this year, it has indicated record low rates should remain at least until mid-2019. With the Fed lifting rates seven times since it began tightening in December 2015, the gap between U.S. and German benchmark yields at some maturities is the widest since at least the 1990s.
Favorable Case
Data this week should add to the case for the dollar. The U.S. economy likely grew at a 4.2 percent annual rate last quarter, the fastest since 2014, according to a Bloomberg survey. So even as trade tensions threaten global output, last year’s tax overhaul is helping stoke consumer spending and business investment.
For Tim Graf, head of macro strategy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at State Street Bank & Trust, Mnuchin’s comments at the Group-of-20 summit this past weekend resonated.
“We are still overweight dollars,” Graf said. “If it’s a tariff-only story, then for the time being it’s still dollar-positive,” because China and the euro region have more to lose than the U.S. in such an environment.
“The dynamic changes if things around the currency change, but that’s still a fairly low probability of happening,” Graf said, referring to a scenario where countries race to weaken their currencies to gain an advantage.
Sanguine Outlook
Derivative traders seem to agree, as despite actual swings in exchange rates picking up on Friday, the outlook for the pace of movements (measured by implied volatility on the options) still mostly fell.
Roberto Perli, a partner at Cornerstone Macro LLC and a former Fed economist, says Trump’s criticism of Fed rate hikes actually may have improved the likelihood that policy makers tighten as planned, to drive home their independence.
“If anything, the incentive will be to tighten more, not less, because of this political pressure,” Perli said in a note Friday.
That’s good for traders who were long the dollar before Trump’s tweet storm.
As of July 17, hedge funds and other futures speculators were the most bullish on the greenback since February 2017, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.
Their growing confidence in the U.S. currency does fly in the face of history, which shows that a full-blown trade war typically causes dollar weakness in the end.
But for now, as Taylor sums it all up, “Trump might want a weaker dollar, but he won’t get it.”

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.13% to 94.37.
Sales of previously-owned homes in the U.S. fell in June, as tight supply continued to ramp up house prices, deterring potential home buyers, weighing on housing activity.
Existing home sales fell 0.6% in June from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.38 million units, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) said Monday. Economists were expecting a 0.5% increase to 5.46 million units.
""The root cause is without a doubt the severe housing shortage that is not releasing its grip on the nation's housing market,"" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist with NAR.
The soft U.S. home sales data arrived as the dollar neared session highs after fighting its way back from session lows, following sharp losses against the yen.
The yen had rallied against the dollar earlier in the session as a Reuters report suggesting the Bank of Japan was in discussions to tweak its quantitative easing program to make it more sustainable sent Japanese government bonds spiralling down and yields surging, prompting the central bank to offer to buy an unlimited amount of bonds.
USD/JPY was flat at Y111.47. The pair recovered from an intraday low of Y110.75.
Sentiment on the dollar has soured somewhat in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump’s remarks last week, in which he expressed concerns about a stronger greenback, asserting it was “taking away our [United States] big competitive edge.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The yen strengthened broadly on Monday following a Reuters report that the Bank of Japan was debating moves to scale back its massive monetary stimulus, spurring bids for the Japanese currency.
The yen's gains were modest, with the 10-year Japanese government bond yields hitting a six-month high, as traders wanted to see concrete measures from the BOJ.
""The market may be too complacent that the BOJ would be in this easy policy mode forever,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. ""We have to wait and see what happens.""
The BOJ, facing stubbornly low inflation, is in unusually active discussions, with changes to its interest-rate targets and stock-buying program on the table, people familiar with the central bank's thinking told Reuters.
The BOJ's current policy, adopted in mid-2016, consists mainly of negative short-term interest rates, keeping the 10-year yield around zero percent and buying about 6 trillion yen worth of stocks through exchange traded funds (ETFs).
Expectations the central bank may unveil some measures at its next monetary policy meeting on July 30 and 31 sent bond yields (JP10YT=RR) jumping to 0.093 percent and the yen rallying to a two-week high against the dollar and the euro.
Some analysts raised doubts whether the Japanese policymakers would agree to move away from an easy policy stance as domestic inflation remains below their 2 percent target and in the wake of last week's comments from U.S. President Donald Trump, who criticized the U.S. dollar's strength.
The yen reached a two-week peak at 110.74 yen per dollar before easing to 111.27 yen , which was up 0.1 percent from Friday, Reuters data showed.
It strengthened to a two-week high at 129.85 yen per euro before retreating to 130.33 yen, up 0.25 percent on the day. (EURJPY=)
CNBC reported on Friday that Trump was worried the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates twice more this year. Trump said the Fed's policy tightening and the strong dollar could hurt the U.S. economy.
Also underpinning support for the yen were Trump's comments in a late-night Twitter message warning Iran from making more threats against the United States.
The Japanese currency is seen as a safe-haven due to political worries.
With short bets against the yen doubling to nearly 60,000 contracts in the latest weekly data, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, some traders expected more upside for the yen in the short term.
Positioning data suggested some signs of peaking in bullish dollar bets after a recent buildup.

As the dollar strengthens amid the trade tensions, the slide in the yuan is spurring concern that China might be embracing purposeful devaluation as a policy tool. That stoked the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump, who accused the country and the European Union of manipulating their currencies. China’s foreign ministry spokesman said Monday the country has no desire to boost its exports through competitive devaluation while the nation’s sound economic fundamentals are providing support to the currency.
“The yuan’s definitely weighing on risk, although much more so on Asia,” said Edwin Gutierrez, the London-based head of emerging-market sovereign debt at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “But we are confident that the Chinese will not let things get disorderly. Having recently won the battle against capital outflows, they’re not about to stoke those again by letting the currency depreciate significantly.”
The People’s Bank of China last week fixed the currency past 6.7 per dollar for the first time in almost a year and on Friday weakened the reference rate the most in two years. On Monday, the PBOC strengthened the yuan’s fixing by 0.12 percent to 6.7593, though it was still slightly weaker than traders and analysts had expected. The offshore yuan erased its gain to trade lower at 10:30 a.m. in London.
A further drop in the Chinese currency to 7 against the dollar may trigger another round of panic selling in emerging markets, Gutierrez said. The currency regained some ground on Friday after a big Chinese bank sold dollars, traders said.

The Argentine and Mexican peso as well as Brazil’s real have been the top-performing developing-nation currencies this month. Aberdeen Standard has been overweight Latin American currencies “for quite a while,” Gutierrez said.

720,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 03:48AM ET</span>","Forex - Trump Comments Knock Dollar, Yen Up on BoJ Speculation","Investing.com - The dollar was broadly lower on Monday following comments by U.S. President Donald Trump on interest rates and the currency’s strength, while the yen gained after reports that Japan’s central bank is debating moves to scale back its massive stimulus program.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, slid 0.18% to 94.09 by 03:48 AM ET (07:48 AM GMT), pulling further away from the one-year high of 95.44 reached on Thursday.
The dollar has come under pressure after Trump launched an attack on the Federal Reserve on Thursday, claiming that their plans to raise U.S. interest rates risked undermining his efforts at strengthening the economy.
Trump ratcheted up his criticism of the Fed on Friday, taking to Twitter to claim that tighter monetary policy was penalizing the U.S. by contributing to a stronger dollar.
He also accused China and the European Union of currency and interest-rate manipulation that he claims has put the U.S. at a disadvantage.
The dollar index fell 0.77% on Friday, its largest one-day percentage decline in three weeks, which was enough to turn the index negative for the month.
The dollar fell to its lowest level in two weeks against the yen, with USD/JPY down 0.47% to 110.95. The dollar has now fallen around 2% against the Japanese currency since hitting a six month peak of 113.16 last Thursday.
The yen was boosted after Reuters and other media outlets reported that the Bank of Japan is actively discussing changes to its massive monetary stimulus program. The BoJ is due to hold its next policy meeting at the end of the month.
The euro pushed higher against the dollar, with EUR/USD adding on 0.14% to trade at 1.1735.
The pound was also a touch higher, with GBP/USD rising 0.17% to 1.3151.
Investors were continuing to monitor developments in the intensifying global trade conflict after Trump indicated Friday that he is prepared to slap tariffs on all Chinese imports to the U.S., worth around $500 billion per year.
The U.S. and China have already imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other’s imports.
Meanwhile, finance ministers and central bank heads from the G20 nations called for more dialogue to prevent trade and geopolitical tensions from hurting growth at a weekend meeting in Buenos Aires."
721,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>",China’s Stealth Yuan Devaluation Catching Trump’s Attention,"(Bloomberg) -- For more than a month, China seemed to be enjoying the advantage of exchange-rate depreciation without the global backlash and panicky capital outflows that accompanied the bout of yuan weakening in 2015. Then Donald Trump took issue.
The U.S. president’s charges that China is “manipulating” a currency that’s been “dropping like a rock” came at the end of a six-week slide in the yuan that took it to its lowest level in more than a year against the dollar. The remarks, in a tweet and an interview with CNBC, suggested to market participants that the U.S.-China trade war is now broadening to include currencies, putting fresh scrutiny on Chinese management of the yuan.
After overseeing a slide in the yuan of almost 5 percent since mid-June, the question for Chinese officials now is whether to turn to other policy measures to support growth in the face of headwinds to exports. Wang Tao at UBS Group AG is among those predicting China will use other tools than the exchange rate to “cushion the blow” from the trade war.
“The central bank will work to stabilize the currency,” Wang, UBS’s head of China economic research in Hong Kong, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “So what can China do? At this moment I think they can ease some of the tightening” in credit and fiscal policy, to support infrastructure investment, she said.
China set the reference rate for the onshore yuan at 6.7593 Monday, compared with a forecast 6.7554. The offshore yuan was little changed at 6.7764 as of 9:17 a.m. in Shanghai.
Trump’s criticism aside, China watchers have highlighted how the yuan’s depreciation this time around is better understood by investors as a reflection of economic fundamentals, rather than the 2015-style shock.
“A few years ago we didn’t have a story to justify the yuan weakening,” said Iris Pang, greater China economist at ING Bank in Hong Kong. “It was the PBOC that triggered the sudden yuan devaluation, without any notice or without any hints,” she said of the People’s Bank of China in 2015.
While the yuan has had effects on markets -- for example, futures contracts on the S&P 500 Index, Asian equities and oil all dropped for a time Friday after China cut the yuan’s daily reference rate the most in more than two years -- the impact has been limited.
The S&P 500, for example, remains on track for a fourth consecutive month of gains, compared with its 6.3 percent decline of August 2015. While Chinese stocks have entered a bear market, with the CSI 300 Index down about 20 percent from its January peak, that’s occurred alongside softening growth and worries over rising corporate defaults.
Market Driven?
As China’s officials determine whether to respond to Trump’s yuan manipulation charge, economists say there are clear arguments for a cheaper Chinese currency, justifying the current weakness.
“The currency should be depreciating from a broad macro perspective -- you have the Fed hiking and PBOC easing, so at some point it will be reflected in the FX market,” Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) in Hong Kong, told Bloomberg Television. “This is still in line with the broader PBOC policy of introducing more volatility and letting the market play itself out.”
Bloomberg Economics estimates that the yuan is around 6.6 percent overvalued, based on economic fundamentals. Fielding Chen and Tom Orlik wrote in their analysis Friday that “there’s a sense that the decline is in line with Beijing’s wishes and -- if they want -- under their control.”
Even so, China has reasons to avoid sustained declines in the yuan. Earlier this decade it burned through about $1 trillion of reserves to stem an exodus of capital. And this June saw $10.7 billion in cross-border outflows,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimates.
Chinese authorities have taken steps to ensure the slide doesn’t get unwieldy. After a 2 percent drop over the space of a week, PBOC Governor Yi Gang and other senior officials in early July underscored that China favored a stable currency. Again on Friday, after the morning tumble in the yuan began unsettling Asian investors, there were signs of action to stem the decline.
“Chasing USD/CNY higher is probably the wrong trade,”  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategists including Zach Pandl in New York wrote in a note to clients Friday, referring to the dollar-yuan currency ticker. The yuan “will be more stable, as the U.S. could interpret further depreciation as a form of retaliation,” they said, sticking with a three-month forecast of 6.7 per dollar. “For now.”

722,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>","Forex - Dollar Weakens after Trump Criticises Global Monetary Policy, Fed ","Investing.com - The dollar slipped on Monday as U.S. President Donald Trump criticised the Federal Reserve and global monetary policy over the weekend.
On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump accused the European Union and China of manipulating their currencies.  
""China, the European Union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower,"" Trump said in a tweet over the weekend. That, coupled with U.S. interest rate hikes, was weakening U.S.’s economy as the dollar strengthened, Trump claimed. 
In a separate tweet, Trump added that ""[t]ightening now hurts all that we have done."" That came after the president told CNBC in an interview that he was ""not thrilled"" about the central bank hiking interest rates.
His comment led to the downfall of dollar, which saw a one-year high on Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s comment indicated rising interest rates in the future.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin clarified at the G-20 meeting over the weekend that Trump didn’t intend to interfere with the Fed’s decision. “The administration completely supports the Fed's independence. Where the Fed ends up on interest rates is one, completely up to them, and [two], is also dependent upon what happens to the economy.”
Despite his efforts in easing the tension, the dollar continued to fall.
The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies, traded at $94.06 at 1:05AM ET (05:05 GMT), down 0.2% from the previous session.
Meanwhile, the USD/CNY pair slipped 0.08% to $6.7650, while the euros went up against the dollar to 1.1740. Trump lashed out at China and the European Union for manipulating their currencies over the weekend and keeping their interest rates low. He tweeted, “The U.S. is raising rates while the dollars get stronger and stronger with each passing day - taking away our big competitive edge.”
Elsewhere, the USD/JPY pair also dropped 0.48% to $110.9 following events over the weekend. Japanese stocks were under pressure by strength in the yen, with the Nikkei 225 down more than 1% on Monday."
723,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 22, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>",Fears of Currency War Ease After Mnuchin's Two Days in Argentina,"(Bloomberg) -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin landed in Buenos Aires for a summit on Friday with the risk of a currency war in the air. He left two days later with the world’s top finance chiefs feeling much more at ease.
Mnuchin over roughly 48 hours tamped down concern of any shift in currency policy, hammering home in a press conference early Saturday that America’s longstanding commitment to a strong greenback remains intact. He also said the U.S. isn’t trying to intervene in the dollar market.
His comments at the Group of 20 nations summit followed tweets on Friday from President Donald Trump, who accused China and the euro area of manipulating their currencies while complaining that a rising dollar is hurting the U.S. His comments caused the greenback on Friday to weaken the most in four months as investors feared Trump was embarking on a new era of jawboning the currency to boost exports.
But by the end of the G-20 meetings, few central bankers or finance ministers were talking about a potential currency war in which nations compete to devalue their exchange rates. “We didn’t discuss the topic,” Spain’s Economy Minister Nadia Calvino told reporters Sunday afternoon.
Trade Conflict
G-20 participants instead focused much of their attention on a global trade conflict, as tit-for-tat tariffs between the U.S. and its partners threaten to undermine business confidence, disrupt global supply chains and elevate consumer prices. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde also raised alarms about the disputes, urging G-20 nations to resolve disagreements via international cooperation.
G-20 nations published a final communique at the close of the summit that warned risks to the world economy have increased amid heightened trade tensions.
After more than a dozen bilateral meetings, plenary sessions and a working dinner at a local steak house, Mnuchin said it had been simple to reach agreement on the group’s final statement. “It was the easiest communique -- it was finished yesterday,” he said Sunday.
Despite his diplomacy on the currency front, Mnuchin didn’t soften the administration’s stance on trade and its tough rhetoric against Beijing. As part of its push to rebalance world trade in America’s favor, the White House has slapped tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports as well as $34 billion of Chinese goods.
Mnuchin told reporters Saturday the White House would continue to pressure countries to open their markets to American exports and investments, and questioned whether the yuan’s decline was the result of market forces or government interference. Mnuchin said the U.S. will closely monitor China’s exchange rate, which has fallen more than any major currency in the past month.
The U.S. position on trade attracted sympathy from some participants of the G-20 meetings, with Australia’s Treasurer Scott Morrison saying the Americans have understandable complaints. “There are some grievances that have been around for a decade and the tit-for-tat announcements on tariffs were an unconventional way to resolve those issues,” he said on the sidelines of the summit.
The Europeans were less understanding and voiced support for a unified position in confronting the U.S. The summit wrapped up just days before European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker travels to Washington to discuss trade issues, including U.S. threats to slap tariffs on automobile imports. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said progress is unlikely as long as the U.S. tries to use duties as leverage.
“We refuse to negotiate with a gun to the head,” he said.

725,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",Trump and the U.S. dollar: Actions speak louder than words,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and James Thorne
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump may not be happy about the strength of the U.S. dollar, but the greenback's recent rally may partly be a product of his own making. 
The U.S. dollar has been climbing against major currencies for several months, with the dollar index (DXY) up nearly 7.0 percent over the last three months and on Thursday hit a one year high. 
The dollar has strengthened since late 2015 as the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates against a background of steady economic growth, slowly rising inflation and the lowest U.S. unemployment rate since the 1960s.
The Fed has raised rates twice this year and is expected to raise rates a couple more times by year end which may attract more foreign into the U.S. dollar with monetary policy remaining loose in Europe and Japan, analysts said.
In a break with the usual practice by U.S. presidents, Trump has been unusually vocal about the dollar, publicly criticizing its strength several times, though analysts question whether his frequent rhetoric will have a lasting impact. 
In a CNBC television interview on Thursday and again on Friday, Trump said he was concerned about the potential impact of a stronger dollar on American exports. 
He also broke convention by criticizing Federal Reserve policy on raising interest rates, saying it takes away from the United States' ""big competitive edge"". 
TRUMP'S FISCAL AND TRADE POLICY SUPPORT US DOLLAR
But investors and traders attribute some of the gains to the Trump administration's tax cuts which are widening the fiscal deficit, leading to more government borrowing, and the imposition of import tariffs against China, Europe, Mexico and Canada which may contribute to inflation. 
""By running tight monetary policy and loose fiscal policy, Trump has put almost perfect conditions in place for a rally in the dollar,"" said Karl Schamotta, a strategist at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto.
""That attracts dollars to the United States and increases the absorption of capital within the U.S. economy. That is going to boost the dollar in and of it itself.""
The $1.5 trillion tax cut passed by Congress in December last year, and the $1.3 trillion spending bill enacted in March, have pushed forecasts for the fiscal deficit higher. 
As a result, by 2020 the U.S. government's debt levels may be the highest since World War Two, according to the Congressional Budget Office in June. 
While the Federal Reserve is raising short term interest rates in the face of consumer price inflation running at 2.9 percent annually in June, longer term bond yields may rise to attract foreign capital to finance the wider fiscal deficit and in turn keep the U.S. dollar strong. 
“The Fed is responding to the inputs that have been provided: stronger fiscal stimulus should imply stronger growth,"" said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist TD Securities in New York. ""That may lead to additional inflation and tighter labor markets. So in order to keep inflation in check they may need to hike interest rates.” 
""For that to change we'd need the Fed to back off its tightening policy or for tightening to begin to happen in Europe and Japan and I don't see either of those happening,"" said Stephen Massocca, Senior Vice President at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.
But analysts also attribute some of the dollar's strength to the escalating tensions over trade policy between the United States and many of its key trading partners, with investors betting the dollar will gain at the expense of emerging market currencies which are dependent on commodity exports. 
Companies in the U.S. and other countries may find themselves less able to compete globally as import tariffs contribute to rising input costs, higher consumer prices, and lower demand for commodities from emerging markets as a result. 
Trump, in the CNBC interview on Friday, said he was ready to impose tariffs on all $500 billion of imported goods from China, potentially further escalating a trade clash.
""A lot of the stuff that he wants versus what is actually being implemented are inconsistent,"" said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist TD Securities, in New York. ""That is the way markets work and the economy works. You can't have your cake and eat it too.""
Even though the dollar does tend to react sharply to Trump's words in the short term, analysts say there appears to be limited lasting impact and they do not expect that to change. 
""I really only see this as a short-term consequence,"" said Issa.
The impact on the dollar could be a little more lasting if Trump makes it a point to attack the dollar's strength repeatedly.
""If it becomes a more constant drumbeat, it's probably something that is going to weigh on dollar more significantly,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. 
Trump's remarks about the greenback also struck some as ironic, given his strong words accusing the European Union and China of manipulating their respective currencies.

""It's like, pot, meet kettle,"" said Schamotta.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.64% to 94.37. The slump in the dollar index saw it turn negative for the week after hitting fresh 52-week highs of 95.44 Thursday intraday.
Trump took to Twitter to express concerns about a stronger U.S. dollar, which he said was “taking away our [United States] big competitive edge.” As well as the Fed's approach to monetary policy, other central banks were also criticized by Trump as he claimed they were “manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower.”
Trump's comments – a break away from a long-standing norm of sitting presidents avoiding commentary on Fed policy – won't affect the Federal Open Market Committee's monetary policy decision, according to St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard.
“The FOMC has a mandate to keep inflation low and stable and obtain maximum employment for the U.S. economy, so people can comment, including the president and other politicians, but it’s up to the committee to try to take the best action we can to achieve those objectives,” Bullard said.
Trump's remarks came amid renewed focus on U.S. trade war tensions after the president said he was ""ready"" to slap $500 billion worth of tariffs on Chinese goods imported to the U.S.
That raised demand for safe-haven currencies such as the yen and Swiss Franc.
USD/JPY fell 0.68% to Y111.70, while USD/CHF fell 0.44% to 0.9946.
GBP/USD rose 0.74% to $1.3111, as the pair continued its recovery from slump below $1.30 Thursday, which followed weaker-than-expected U.K. retail sales.

In another statement, Trump criticized the Fed for increasing interest rates. The Fed raised rates twice this year and is expected to raise rates at least once more before the end of the year.



St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard responded to Trump’s comments, saying the Fed would not be impacted.
“The [Fed] has a mandate to keep inflation low and stable and obtain maximum employment for the U.S. economy, so people can comment, including the president and other politicians, but it’s up to the committee to try to take the best action we can to achieve those objectives,” he said.

728,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 20, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",Flailing Euro Is Unlikely to Find Any Succor From ECB Meeting,"(Bloomberg) -- The euro has been treading water. It is unlikely to find a rescuing hand from the European Central Bank, whose policy makers meet next week.
While analysts expect the shared currency to strengthen as the year progresses, conviction in that view is shaky, with strategists having pared their calls recently. The euro was knocked down after the ECB’s mid-June policy review, when President Mario Draghi dashed expectations for tightening in early 2019. Since then, trade tensions have heightened and core inflation in the euro area has been revised downward, which gives the ECB little incentive to change tack any time soon.
The policy divergence between the Federal Reserve and the ECB is another factor that is curbing enthusiasm on the euro. Shorter-term bond yields, which are usually more sensitive to changing views on monetary policy, are in favor of the dollar: the two-year yield differential between U.S. Treasuries and German bunds widened this week to more than 300 basis points, the most in data going back to 1990.
The euro has weakened about 2.5 percent so far this year and has been confined to an about 300-pip range since May. The currency was at $1.1700 on Friday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey is for it to climb to $1.1800 by the end of this year, but this prediction is lower than the $1.2600 forecast in May.
Concerns that the current tariff spat between the U.S. and China could transform into a currency war is likely to draw concern from the ECB. Policy makers “will focus on potential communication on the short-term downside risk stemming from protectionism,” Danske Bank analysts including Piet PH Christiansen said in a client note this week.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.15% to 94.84 as of 5:36 AM ET (9:36 GMT).
Despite the dip, the dollar was on target for a second straight week of gains and has risen more than 5% in the last three months due to expectations that interest rates will rise.
Trump said in an interview on CNBC that he does not approve of how the Fed is approaching monetary policy. The Fed raised rates twice this year and is expected to raise rates at least once more before the end of the year.
“I’m not thrilled,” Trump said. “Because we go up and every time you go up they want to raise rates again. I don't really — I am not happy about it. But at the same time I’m letting them do what they feel is best.”
Meanwhile trade tensions continued, with the European Union expected to retaliate against the U.S. with more tariffs after America imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum in June. Tariffs on around $3.8 billion of U.S. goods have already been imposed by Europe.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar held below a one-year high on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump expressed concern about a stronger currency, although a weakening Chinese yuan reduced risk appetite.
The dollar is poised for a second straight week of gains and has gained more than 5 percent in the past three months on expectations the U.S. central bank will keep raising interest rates in the coming months. 
But in a CNBC interview on Thursday, Trump said a strong dollar puts the United States at a disadvantage and that the Chinese yuan ""was dropping like a rock"".
""The comments are more likely to, on the margin, stem flows into dollar assets given renewed uncertainty over the U.S. administration’s dollar policy,"" ING strategists said.
Against a basket of other currencies (DXY), the dollar held at 95.19, just below the one-year high of 95.62 it reached in the previous session. 
But risk appetite remained subdued after China allowed the currency to weaken by lowering its daily midpoint fixing. The People's Bank of China dropped the midpoint  for a seventh straight trading day to 6.7671 per dollar on Friday, 605 pips or 0.9 percent weaker than the previous fix of 6.7066. 
Friday's fixing was the lowest since July 14, 2017, and represented the biggest one-day weakening in percentage terms since June 27, 2016.
""The Chinese currency really seems like it might be in play again rather than just catching up with a stronger dollar,"" Rabobank strategists said in a daily note.
The Australian dollar  was barely changed at $0.7364, recouping losses after dropping nearly half a percent in early trade.

The USD/CNY pair traded sharply lower and tumbled to a one-year low after The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) weakened the fixing by 0.9% to 6.7671 per dollar on Friday.
Investors are concerned with the PBOC’s seeming comfort with the yuan’s slide. On July 3, Chinese central bankers pledged to keep their currency stable and to not use it as a weapon in the trade conflict with the U.S. That effort helped the yuan reverse some of its plunge earlier this month.
Nomura Holdings Inc. said in a note on Thursday that the decline in the yuan could soon turn to boom should the People’s Bank of China shift toward stimulus mode in the world’s no. 2 economy.
“As Chinese financial conditions further deteriorate and market stress worsens, we actually perversely push closer to the risk-asset positive outcome of escalated PBOC stimulus and easing measures,” said Charlie McElligott, a strategist with Nomura’s equities group. “Essentially, we are nearing the pain-point of the ‘PBOC Put.’”
“An additional ‘right tail’ scenario is that the worse things get in China in the near-term, the more likely it is that we too could see Chinese concessions in the trade war with the U.S.,” he wrote. That “could destroy market tension and volatility and drive a gap higher in risk sentiment,” he said.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, slipped 0.06% to 94.92 on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates.  
Trump said he is “not thrilled” with the Fed’s plan to raise rates four times this year and expressed concerns that the work he has done would be nullified.  
Fed officials, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have raised interest rates twice this year so far and have pointed to two more before the end of 2018. 
“I’m not thrilled,” Trump said in an interview with CNBC. “Because we go up and every time you go up they want to raise rates again. I don't really — I am not happy about it. But at the same time I’m letting them do what they feel is best.” 
“But I don’t like all of this work that goes into doing what we’re doing,” Trump added."
732,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 10:20PM ET</span>",Yuan's Fallout for Markets Means No Summer Lull for Traders,"(Bloomberg) -- The market turmoil spurred by the Chinese yuan’s tumble to a one-year low is putting traders on alert during the normally sleepy Northern hemisphere summer.
As the onshore yuan plunged 0.9 percent Thursday, its biggest drop since 2015 on a closing basis, it took most Asian currencies along for the ride amid broad dollar strength. Copper slid below $6,000 a metric ton for the first time in a year, slumping along with other industrial metals and shares of mining companies. A gauge of emerging-market currencies extended its rout since an April peak to 6.7 percent.
Investors were caught off guard by the central bank’s seeming indifference to the yuan’s slide. The People’s Bank of China weakened its fixing beyond 6.7 per dollar Thursday for the first time since August 2017. With trade tensions between the Washington and Beijing simmering -- and possibly providing motivation for the Asian nation to let the yuan drop further -- the volatility may continue.
“The line in the sand may have shifted higher, causing the market to pay up,” said Neil Jones, the head of hedge fund sales at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in London, who added that a drop to 7 per dollar would be a major concern. “It’s not shaping up to be a summer lull.”
The yuan’s weakness appears to already be drawing the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump, who said to CNBC that the currency is “dropping like a rock,” putting America at a disadvantage. Losses continued on Friday after the PBOC weakened the daily reference rate by the most in two years. The yuan was down 0.2 percent at 6.7901 per dollar.
Thursday’s slide had multiple drivers, including Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy, a view that’s likely to keep the central bank on a gradual policy-tightening path. It’s also been punished by growing pessimism about the outlook for Chinese economic expansion amid the nation’s deleveraging drive, as well as concern about the fallout from a possible trade war between the world’s two largest economies.
Investors are also trying to gauge the impact of China’s efforts to bolster growth by loosening monetary policy. Banks are being offered cash and given instructions to boost lending, according to the banking and insurance regulator, adding to evidence of a shift toward greater official support for the economy.
“It certainly does have traders sitting up, even if not fully engaging yet,” said Oliver Jackson, the global head of sales trading at Saxo Bank A/S. The slump in the yuan “did catch most by surprise, but it seems the market is now buying the lack of intervention as a positive note towards a shift in fiscal policy.”
Along with Mizuho, strategists at Nomura International Plc also raised the possibility of the yuan falling to 7 per dollar, a level it hasn’t seen since 2008. TD Securities analysts see commodity-linked currencies from Australia, New Zealand and Canada as “collateral damage.”  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) said the yuan will be a factor that “drives the dollar.”
Options markets haven’t priced in significant fluctuations in the months to come. One-year implied volatility for the offshore yuan has climbed above 6 percent after the recent spot selloff. Still, that’s far lower than this year’s high of more than 7 percent reached in February, not to mention spikes in 2015 and 2016 that pushed double digits.
Strategists, however, are showing considerably more pessimism, citing policy makers’ hands-off approach to the slide. The central bank may see the yuan’s drop as beneficial to exporters, the companies in the cross-hairs of the U.S.’s increasingly aggressive trade stance.
“Don’t underestimate the geopolitics,” said Viraj Patel, a strategist at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV in London. The “PBOC letting market forces work and not intervening is a signal -- Washington can’t have it’s cake and eat it, can’t call out China for manipulating currency markets -- and then have a go at them for letting market forces prevail.”
But it doesn’t mean the PBOC can turn a blind eye if the weakness in the yuan accelerates. Authorities will keep in mind what happened a few years back, when a rapid depreciation drove capital outflow and policy makers were compelled to tighten financial conditions.
“Authorities have deep scars from the 2015/2016 experience,” said Calvin Tse, the North American head of G-10 FX strategy at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). Still, so far, “all the signs we’ve seen from China have shown a favoring of fine-tuning measures.”

733,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 06:30PM ET</span>",Trump and dollar: friend or foe?,"By Trevor Hunnicutt and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump's comments that a strong dollar ""puts us at a disadvantage"" caused an instant fall in the greenback on Thursday and marked another example of the U.S. president commenting directly - and sometimes contradictorily - on the country's currency.
Talking directly about the dollar is a break with typical practice by U.S. presidents, who are wary of being seen as interfering directly with financial markets, although presidents have influenced the currency with their policies or subtle hints. 
""There are certain comments most presidents wouldn't make,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. ""They'd defer monetary policy to the Fed and the dollar to the Treasury secretary. But Donald Trump is not most presidents.""
In an interview with CNBC that aired in part on Thursday, Trump also said he was concerned that interest rate hikes would put the United States at a disadvantage. Higher interest rates and a strong dollar typically go hand-in-hand, because better yields attract foreign investment.
Yet the remarks, in an interview with CNBC that aired in part on Thursday, in which Trump said he was concerned that interest rate hikes as well as a strong dollar, would put the United States at a disadvantage, are not a break with his own practices.
There are occasional examples of presidents making remarks on the dollar in the past, including George W. Bush being quoted in 2003 that dollar declines were ""contrary to our policy.""
But Trump has made comments far more often, varying on whether he thinks the dollar should be stronger or weaker. 
In January 2017, after a post-election run-up in the dollar, Trump said the currency was ""too strong."" In April 2017 he reiterated that stance. But that July Trump said he liked a dollar that was ""not too strong."" 
After a bout of weakness in the greenback, in January 2018 Trump said he wanted a strong dollar. 
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, has gained about 6 percent in the past three months. The rise has been driven by strong U.S. economic data, rising interest rates and the possibility that a trade war could cause inflationary pressures and reduce the trade deficit of the world's largest economy - factors that at least in part owe to Trump's own policies.
The U.S. trade deficit and the loss of manufacturing jobs that Trump blames on unfair advantages enjoyed by other countries have been centerpieces of his economic policies. A strong dollar makes exports more expensive to purchasers. ""A strong dollar would undermine his stance on trade,"" said Eric Stein, co-director of global income group at Eaton Vance Management. ""We might hear more beating of the drum about a weaker dollar.""
Some traders, however, said they doubted that Trump's remarks would have a lasting effect.
""The dollar issue is momentary, nothing of consequence,"" said Mark Grant, chief global strategist at B.Riley FBR Inc.

After Trump's remarks, the greenback (DXY), which hit a one-year peak earlier on Thursday, fell 0.5 percent before rebounding a bit. In recent weeks, investors have been more confident that the dollar will rise.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the green against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.08% to 94.75, after hitting a session high of 95.44.
""I'm not happy about it,"" President Donald Trump said about interest-rate increases during an interview with CNBC Thursday, claiming that ""higher rates put us [United States] at a disadvantage."" Trump insisted, however, that he would let the ""Fed do what they feel is best.""
The comments scaled back some investor optimism over a faster pace of rate hikes which had followed bullish comments from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell earlier in the week.
Powell said gradual interest rate hikes would be ""the best way forward"" for the economy, citing stronger labor markets, and inflation that had met the Fed's 2% objective.
Downside in the dollar limited, however, as positive economic data reaffirmed investor expectations the economy remained on solid footing.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims dropped by 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 207,000 for the week ended July 14, beating economists’ forecast for a drop to 220,000.
The Philadelphia Fed said Thursday its manufacturing index rose to a reading of 25.7 in July from 19.9 in June.
GBP/USD fell 0.23% to $1.3039, after plunging below $1.30 earlier as UK retail sales undershot expectations, denting the prospect for an August Bank of England rate hike.

735,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 10:29AM ET</span>",Firmer U.S. dollar boosts corporate interest in currency hedging,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed, Jessica DiNapoli and Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. multinational companies are starting to reevaluate their currency hedging strategies after a surge in the dollar in recent months, as the impact of the stronger greenback starts to show up in second-quarter corporate earnings.
A stronger dollar claimed Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) as its first victim of the earnings season on Monday. The company, which does not hedge its revenue with derivatives, said foreign exchange rates pushed its expectations on the 2018 operating margin to near the lower end of its target range.
""This will be another wake-up call,"" said Wolfgang Koester, chief executive at currency risk consulting firm FiREapps, in Scottsdale, Arizona. ""There are still a lot of companies that don't manage this well enough."" 
The dollar gained more than 5 percent against major trading partners' currencies (DXY) in the second quarter, supported by rising trade war tensions and a hawkish Federal Reserve.
The dollar index, which at the start of the second quarter had been down about 11 percent year-over-year, rose to finish the quarter nearly flat on a year-over-year basis.
The dollar's rise has emerged as a surprise risk at the start of what is otherwise expected to be a robust U.S. corporate earnings season. Foreign currency earnings of U.S. multinational companies are worth less in dollars when the currency is stronger.
Banks said their inquiries from clients had gone up recently. 
""Our volume of hedging activities increased from clients from April or May until now,” said Kuniyuki Hirai, head of foreign exchange trading for MUFG in New York. 
The dollar's recent strength is a sharp departure from its weakening trend in 2017, when it delivered a boost to large U.S. companies and may have made managing currency risks less of a priority.
Some analysts expect a rise in trade protectionism to boost the greenback in the near term, which could mean more companies are likely to cite the stronger dollar for future earnings weakness. 
“We get more questions about hedging when currency moves,” said Roberto Battistuzzi, director of foreign exchange sales at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). “If anything, it allows companies to take the opportunity to see how the programs are performing.”
Bryan Morales, a director in Citizens Bank's global markets group, said there had been some pickup in hedging demand recently, with the Federal Reserve hiking rates. Interest rate differences between countries drive hedging costs, and as the Fed raises interest rates it can become more attractive to hedge.
The Fed has raised rates twice already this year and is expected to raise rates one or two more times by year end. 
""It's provided more opportunity for clients hesitant about hedging to take advantage of a premium,"" Morales said.

MANAGING RISK 
Netflix is an example of currency risks faced by companies that do a lot of their business in international markets, even as the vast majority of their costs remain dollar-denominated. Most S&P companies do hedge currency risk, analysts said.
""We don't hedge because we don't think we're differentially better at predicting FX, and hedging only mitigates the movements over the short run, like six months,"" a Netflix spokesman said.
The company, which does not plan to change its stance on currency hedging, will try to move more of its costs offshore, to help create a natural hedge, the company said.
That approach is favored by an increasing number of companies.
Bob Doll, senior portfolio manager and chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, in Princeton, New Jersey, said natural hedging is being relied on ""more and more"" by companies, ""particularly as they become more global and have so many currency relationships.""
But there are limits to the strategy. ""It's rare in these industries that you can have a full natural hedge position,"" said Amo Sahota, director at Klarity FX in San Francisco. ""We expect to see the market start to return to more traditional long-term hedging programs.""
 Oracle Corp  (N:ORCL) is among other companies that have mentioned the dollar as a headwind while Carnival Corp (N:CCL) and Akamai Technologies (O:AKAM) have also talked in recent months about the adverse impact from the dollar.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) estimates that a sustained 10 percent appreciation in the dollar against the euro results in a reduction in S&P 500 earnings per share of 3 to 4 percent.
""Right now there are a number of companies out there which are still reporting the positive impact of currency valuations from the 2017 dollar weakness,"" Sahota said. ""But that's quickly going to turn around as they start to get the impact from the first half of 2018.""

For the second quarter, year-over-year profit growth for all S&P 500 companies is estimated at 21.4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. That follows earnings growth of 26.6 percent in the first quarter.

Demand for the dollar continued to be underpinned after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave an upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy during congressional testimony on Tuesday and Wednesday, and downplayed the impact of uncertainty over U.S. trade policy on the outlook for additional rate hikes.

At 10:35 GMT, GBP/USD was 1.2997, down 0.55%, the lowest level for the cable since September 2017.
Retail sales month over month fell by 0.5% in June, lower than the expected increase of 0.1%. Sales for May were revised upward from 1.3% to 1.4%. The core retail sales figure, which excludes automobiles and fuel, fell by 0.6% - lower than the expected drop of 0.3%.
Overall retail sales growth for the second quarter came in at the strongest level since 2004 despite the fall in June. The month of June is purported to have been weaker as a result of hotter weather and England’s unexpected success in the World Cup.
The combination of wage growth, soft inflation and now disappointing retail sales for the month of June may give the Bank of England food for thought when the Monetary Policy Committee meet in August to set interest rates.
While chances of a hike have somewhat diminished this week as a result of softer data causing sterling to struggle, the pound was also pressured by a stronger dollar.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measure the strength of the greenback against a basket of six currency majors was 95.22, up 0.40 percent.
The dollar was supported by positive comments regarding the US economy from the new Fed Chair Jay Powell on Wednesday.

EUR/USD was down 0.31% to 1.1603.
Sterling dropped against safe haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc. GBP/CHF was down 0.20 percent to 1.3030, while GBP/JPY was 146.94, down 0.37%.
With no major data releases ahead for sterling in the coming week, it may be further at the mercy of political developments.
Brexit has weighed heavily on the pound. The chance of a no deal Brexit looks more likely as Prime Minister Theresa May’s grip over the Conservative Party loosens, as shown by the resignations of leading cabinet figures including David Davis and Boris Johnson.

The People’s Bank of China weakened its fixing beyond 6.7 on Thursday for the first time since the currency began tumbling in June. Signs on further monetary easing are also adding strains, with China Business News reporting policy makers have made efforts to encourage bank loans and investment in lower-rated corporate debt.
Read about the latest sign of policy easing here.
The yuan has fallen more than 4 percent in the past month, the worst performance among 31 major currencies, as the world’s second largest economy showed signs of slowing and a trade spat with the U.S. escalated. China will tolerate higher volatility in the yuan and a moderate weakening of the currency, according to Pacific Investment Management Co.
The fixing ""signals the PBOC is not defending any line in the sand for the exchange rate and is comfortable with gradual yuan depreciation,"" said Tommy Xie, an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore. The signs of easing are ""certainly not supportive to the yuan, and the currency may see another wave of selling pressures ahead.""
The banking and insurance regulator has also asked financial institutions to “earnestly implement” plans to help reduce financing costs for small firms. It said big lenders should “take the lead,” according to a statement posted on its website.

The report also highlighted a 2.2% decline in building permits to a rate of 1.273 million units. That was the lowest level since September 2017.
Analysts, however, claimed the duo of weaker reports did not signal that the housing recovery had ""shorted out.""
""While labor also remains in short supply and pricey, we believe the greatest impediment to homebuilding right now is that fewer projects pencil out. That said, the housing recovery has not shorted out,"" Wells Fargo said.
Market participants were also monitoring Fed Chairman Jay Powell's testimony before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday. Reaction in currencies was muted as Powell offered little new insight on monetary policy.
A slump in the pound to September lows limited dollar weakness as weaker U.K. inflation data dented expectations for a Bank of England rate hike despite calls from analysts insisting that inflation was strong enough to support an August rate hike.
U.K. inflation data likely won't deter the Bank of England from raising the interest rates in August, ING said. But a further fall in core inflation will make a second rate hike in 2018 unlikely, ING warned.
GBP/USD fell 0.34% to $1.3064, but remained above its session low of $1.3011.
The greenback also gave up gains against safe-haven currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc after China’s Ministry of Commerce warned of further countermeasures in response to U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs.
USD/JPY fell 0.11% to Y112.77, while USD/CHF fell 0.17% to 0.9984.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rose towards a one-year high on Wednesday in the wake of bullish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell about the strength of the U.S. economy.
Though Powell did not alter future expectations of U.S. monetary policy, traders saw his comments as signifying that authorities were comfortable with the greenback's near 6 percent rise against its rivals in the last three months.
In his congressional testimony on Tuesday, Powell said he believed the United States was on course for years more of steady growth, and he played down the risks to the U.S. economy of an escalating trade conflict.
""The recent dollar moves has been a bit baffling and the only reason may be short term flows and sentiment are supporting the greenback,"" said Richard Falkenhall, a senior currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
Against a basket of its rivals (DXY), the dollar edged 0.3 percent higher at 95.40, nearing a one-year peak of 95.50 hit in late June.
The greenback reserved most of its gains against the relatively higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar  and the kiwi  against which it rallied half a percent each.
Though concerns the U.S. economy may be nearing a peak as evident from a flattening yield curve and falling inflation adjusted-yields, the widening rate differentials between the U.S. and other major markets also lifted the greenback.
""We are back in a conventional world where monetary policy divergence is in play and monetary policy supports the dollar,"" said Adam Cole, chief currencies strategist at RBC.

MIND THE GAP
The Fed is expected to have hiked a total of four times in 2018 to tackle rising inflationary pressures. Comparatively, the ECB is expected to start raising rates only in mid 2019.
With U.S. rates continuing to rise and most other major central banks taking only tentative steps towards monetary normalization, many analysts expect more dollar upside. RBC is forecasting a year-end euro/dollar of $1.12.
The dollar rallied to as high as 113.14 against the yen , its strongest since January 9.
""The dollar stands to gain further, particularly against the yen, with risk aversion in the equity markets petering out,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""And while long-term Treasury yields are not rising prominently, this is a reflection of investor demand for U.S. assets that generates a degree of dollar-buying.""
The 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) firmed this week but it has been on a steady decline from a seven-year high above 3 percent set in May.
The two-year Treasury yield (US2YT=RR), most sensitive to the market's views on changes in Fed policy, has risen to a decade-high. As a result the U.S. yield curve was the flattest in 11 years and close to inverting.
An inverted yield curve is sometimes seen as a sign of waning confidence towards the economy and a signal for a recession.
Sterling extended overnight losses  after the government narrowly won a vote on its Brexit proposal, underlining the political divisions that have hampered efforts to agree a united front in negotiating with Brussels.

GBP/USD hit a low of 1.3011, the weakest since Sept. 5, 2017 and was at 1.3039 by 05:06 AM ET (09:06 AM GMT), off 0.54% for the day.
Sterling slid to the day’s lows after data showing that inflation in the UK rose at a slower than expected rate in June, adding to the Bank of England's dilemma as it considers whether to raise interest rates next month.
The Office for National Statistics reported that the annual rate of inflation rose by 2.4% in June, matching May's figure which was a one-year low and falling short of expectations for an increase of 2.6%.
Underlying inflation rose by 1.9% on a year-over-year basis, slowing from 2.1% in the previous month and missing forecasts of 2.2%.
Consumer prices were flat for the month in June, down from 0.4% a month earlier and compared to forecasts of 0.2%.
The inflation figures came a day after data showing that wage growth in the UK slowed to its weakest rate in six months in the three months to May, despite record employment.
With inflation outstripping wage growth consumers are facing a cost of living squeeze, potentially making an August interest rate rise less likely.
Sterling was already on the defensive after falling almost 1% against the dollar on Tuesday amid a fresh bout of Brexit uncertainty following a series of crunch votes in the UK parliament, with Prime Minister Theresa May facing threats from both sides of the Brexit divide.
Demand for the dollar continued to be underpinned as optimistic comments from the head of the U.S. Federal Reserve reinforced expectations that the central bank is on track to keep gradually raising interest rates.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave an upbeat assessment of the outlook for the U.S. economy on Tuesday and downplayed the impact of uncertainty over U.S. trade policy on the outlook for additional rate hikes.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.52% to 94.76.
In his semi-annual testimony to Congress Tuesday, Powell said the ""best way forward"" is to continue raising rates, as the job market has strengthened and inflation has moved above the Fed's 2% target.
Powell largely echoed the Fed's recent comments from its June meeting, when the Fed raised interest rates, and hinted at two further rate hikes for this year. Powell could offer further clues on monetary policy when he testifies before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday.
According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, 85.6% of traders expect the Fed to hike rates in September, and 56.2% of traders expect the Fed to hike rates again in December.
Economic data showing U.S. industrial production rebounded in June, boosted by a sharp rebound in manufacturing, and gains in mining output, had a somewhat muted impact on the greenback.
Industrial production - a measure of output at factories, mines and utilities - rose to a seasonally-adjusted 0.6% in June from a revised 0.5% decline the prior month, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday. This was slightly above the 0.5% rise forecast by economists.
The dollar's move higher was also supported by a fall in both the pound and euro. Sterling came under pressure amid soft UK data and expectations that Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit bill could face another challenge in Parliament.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar edged down on Tuesday ahead of congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell which traders will scrutinize for clues on the pace of U.S. interest rate rises and risks emanating from trade conflicts.
Powell will testify on the economy and monetary policy before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee at 1400 GMT on Tuesday.
He is expected to deliver an upbeat message on the outlook for growth and reaffirm the Fed's gradual monetary tightening policy but could face tough questions on the central bank's independence and how it would deal with an escalation in the global trade war. 
""The escalating trade conflict is becoming an increasingly realistic downside risk that could weigh on sentiment and capital spending,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) analyst Guy Stear. 
""It is questionable how much longer the top central banker will be able to and will want to remain so reserved in view of increasing tensions.""
At 0745 GMT the dollar traded down 0.2 percent at 94.37 (DXY) against a basket of six major currencies, paring small gains booked during early morning trade.
The U.S. currency traded flat against the yen to 112.27 yen , after having approached earlier in the session a six-month high of 112.80 yen reached on July 13.
The dollar's gains have this year been capped by worries over the intensifying trade dispute between the United States and China, although the concerns have not derailed the greenback's solid performance so far.
The International Monetary Fund had warned on Monday that escalating and sustained trade conflicts following U.S. tariff action threaten to derail economic recovery and depress medium-term growth prospects.
Analysts are uncertain how the Fed would react if the conflict over trade with China deteriorates: either with aggressive rate hikes due to the inflationary effect of the import tariffs or with a pause in the hiking cycle due to growth dampening.
""[If the trade war worsens] I would expect that the U.S. dollar would initially appreciate as the result of a flight into safe havens, with it probably benefiting even more in case of aggressive rate hikes,"" said Thu Lan Nguyen, an FX strategist at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.
Other major currency pairs on Tuesday stuck to tight ranges.
The euro (EUR=EBS) and British pound  rose modestly against the greenback. The single currency added 0.2 percent to $1.1738 after weakening half a percent last week while the pound was up 0.1 percent at $1.3255.
The Australian dollar  edged up 0.1 percent to $0.7428. The currency is down more than 5 percent since the start of the year because of a divergence in the interest rate outlook of the U.S. Federal Reserve and Australia's central bank which is seen keeping policy steady for some while yet.

The New Zealand dollar , meanwhile, gained 0.8 percent to $0.6839, its highest level since hitting 0.6835 per dollar on July 11. Annual Core inflation in New Zealand accelerated for the third straight quarter and recorded the largest increase since 2011.

Against a basket of its rivals (DXY), the greenback fell 0.2 percent to 94.60 after rising 0.7 percent last week, its biggest weekly rise since mid-June.

Latest positioning data, however, continued to signal a bullish outlook for the greenback, with net long positions in the dollar registering another increase prompting net long bets to reach their highest levels since early 2017.
A strong rebound in U.S. economic data in the second quarter and the threat of trade protectionism has fueled a near 6 percent rise in the greenback over the last three months but concerns the economic rebound may be fading is prompting some investors to grow cautious about the dollar's outlook.

U.S. President Donald Trump's summit with his Russian counterpart in Helsinki later in the day will also be closely watched, as Trump played down expectations over the weekend for the upcoming talks.

Demand for the dollar has been underpinned as recent economic data indicated that the Federal Reserve is likely to remain on track to raise interest rates twice more this year.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.01% to 94.56, after hitting a two-week high of 95.00.
GBP/USD rebounded from an 11-day low of $1.3103 to $1.3213, after U.S. President Donald Trump walked back his criticism of British Prime Minister Theresa May, and claimed a U.K.-U.S. trade deal was still possible.
That eased investor fears that Britain would struggle to secure a trade deal with the United States as Trump had reportedly told the Sun newspaper on Thursday that May's Brexit plan may ""kill"" Britain's chances of such a deal.
Elsewhere, China's trade surplus with the U.S. hit a record of nearly $29 billion, raising the risk of deepening its trade-related rift with the United States.
That, however, failed to trigger significant demand for safe-haven yen and Swiss franc as the latter fell modestly against the greenback.
USD/JPY fell 0.07% to Y112.44, while USD/CHF rose 0.03% to 1.0027.
The Federal Reserve's release of a monetary policy report to Congress in advance of Fed chairman Powell's testimony before the Senate due Tuesday, also had a muted impact on the dollar.
The Fed gave a positive assessment of the U.S. economy, insisting that strong labor markets and inflation would support the central bank's plan to continue with gradual rate hikes.

760,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 06:05AM ET</span>","Euro, yuan dive as U.S.-China trade concern boosts dollar","By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro fell to a nine-day low on Friday after data showing a record Chinese trade surplus stirred worries about a deeper United States-China trade conflict, encouraging investors into the safety of the dollar.
The Chinese yuan, which has suffered in the past six weeks on concern that U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will eventually hit its economy, reversed earlier gains in Asia and fell half a percent in offshore markets . 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday that the United States and China could reopen trade talks, briefly easing concerns about the trade dispute. 
But data showing China's trade surplus with the United States swelled to a record in June as exports grew could further inflame tensions. Trump this week pledged to impose tariffs on $200 billion more of Chinese imports and Beijing has vowed to retaliate.
""The trade conflict is dominating concerns in the market,"" said Esther Reichelt, an analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt. ""These are sentiment-driven moves.""
The single currency dropped to as low as $1.1613 (EUR=), down 0.4 percent. The dollar index reached a two-week high at 95.232 (DXY).
The safe-haven yen fell to another six-month low at 112.775 yen , however, suggesting investors were not panicking.
The dollar has advanced roughly 2 percent versus the yen this week, the biggest weekly gain since mid-September.
INFLATION GAIN
The dollar's broad rally on Friday was also fueled by U.S. consumer prices data a day earlier. That showed a steady buildup of inflation pressure that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as many as four times in 2018.
While rising inflation is largely expected by markets, it will reinforce the view of a ""widening in monetary policy divergence"" between the Federal Reserve and other central banks, said Piotr Matys, FX strategist at Rabobank.
""The latest set of inflation data confirms that the Fed will stay well ahead of other central banks,"" he said. ""We believe the dollar has the potential to extend its rally.""
European Central Bank minutes published on Thursday also weighed on the euro, showing that members remain dovish and are a long way from normalizing policy.
U.S. President Donald Trump's comments on Britain's Brexit plan killing hopes of a U.S. trade deal also knocked sterling lower, pushing the dollar up further.
Sterling slid more than half a percent to $1.3103 .

The Australian dollar - seen as a proxy for China risk given Australia's reliance on Chinese demand for its big mining exports - tumbled half a percent to $0.7375 . The currency has had a turbulent week, sinking more than 1 percent since Monday.

761,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 01:35AM ET</span>",Top FX diplomat to be reappointed as Japan navigates global trade hazards,"By Yoshifumi Takemoto and Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will reappoint career bureaucrat Masatsugu Asakawa as its top currency diplomat, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Friday, maintaining the status quo at a time of global trade turbulence.
Asakawa became vice finance minister for international affairs at the finance ministry, or Japan's top financial diplomat, in 2015. His reappointment would make him the longest-serving top financial diplomat since Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, who served as vice finance minister for international affairs for 3 1/2 years to Jan 2003. 
Senior posts at the ministry are reviewed annually and it is rare for an official to be kept in a post for this long, highlighting the consistency Asakawa can bring to Japan's relationship with the United States as well as other countries.
""Asakawa has been a stable hand in handling policy issues, and he has dealt well with such cases as sudden yen spikes by coordinating with the Bank of Japan and the Financial Services Agency,"" said Masaki Kuwahara, senior economist at Nomura Securities.
""His reappointment should give a sense of relief to markets particularly at a time when the United States and China are on the verge of falling into a trade war, making it highly unpredictable how currencies move from now on.""
U.S. President Donald Trump has been following through on pledges he made during his 2016 presidential campaign to get tough on China, which he accuses of unfair trade practices.
He has also criticized Japan for running large trade surpluses with the United States.
Asakawa's role is to oversee Japan's currency policy and international economic diplomacy, including representing Tokyo at meetings of the Group of Seven advanced countries and the Group of 20 major economies.
Japan has not intervened in the currency market under Asakawa, ministry records show, though he tends to talk tough on markets to stem yen spikes that risk hurting the export-reliant economy.
Asakawa is close to Finance Minister Taro Aso, having served as his executive secretary when Aso was prime minister in 2008-2009 during the global financial crisis, and as his executive assistant when he became finance minister in 2012.
Aso made no mention of the Asakawa appointment at a regular news briefing on Friday. The minister is expected to officially announce a regular finance ministry reshuffle in coming weeks.

The government will also promote Shigeaki Okamoto, currently director-general of the budget bureau, to administrative vice minister - the top bureaucrat at the ministry, the source said on condition of anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to media.

The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies was up 0.13% at 94.69 by 1:00AM ET (05:00 GMT).
""The dollar has benefited this week from the trade conflict concerns that emerged earlier, which ended up funneling safe-haven bids into the currency,"" said Koji Fukaya, president of FPG Securities in Tokyo.
""On top of that, the U.S. economy has shown it is doing well and Treasury yields have risen, and these factors are all helping the dollar.""
A trade spat between the U.S. and China escalated on Wednesday after Washington threatened to slap 10% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.
The tit-for-tat tariffs have fueled worries that the world’s two largest economies could descend into an all-out trade war, which investors fear could hit global growth.
The USD/JPY pair rose 0.12% to 112.65. The dollar this week has strengthened roughly 2% against the Japanese yen, which normally is bought as a safe haven in times of political tension and market turmoil.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.2% to 94.46.
The Labor Department said on Thursday its Consumer Price index rose just 0.1% last month after edging up 0.3% in May. That missed the economists' forecast for a 0.2% rise.
But that failed to dent optimism over the U.S. inflationary backdrop amid expectations that trade tariffs could increase the pace of domestic inflation.
""The latest reading on prices suggests inflation remains solid, with the risk to rise further as trade tariffs threaten to disrupt global access to materials and stoke U.S. inflation,"" Stifel said in a note to clients.
Downside on the dollar was limited by yen weakness as investor appetite for risk assets returned following a report the U.S. and China were considering resuming trade talks.

Bulgaria meets the nominal criteria to adopt the common currency, with low inflation, healthy public finances and its lev currency already pegged to the euro. 
But it is also the EU's poorest country, and widespread graft and troubles at some of its banks have cast a shadow over its prospects of joining.
One EU official told Reuters that euro zone finance ministers will agree on Thursday on a ""timeframe"" for Bulgaria's next steps toward the euro membership.
They will say they will accept Sofia's request to join the banking union, once the country makes a formal request - a move expected in the coming days or even hours.
Banking union member countries transfer to EU bodies the powers to oversee their top banks and deal with ailing lenders.
In about one year, there will be a reassessment of Bulgaria's progress toward aligning its economy, banks and rules to the banking union, the official said.
Once this process is completed, Bulgaria will be able to apply to join the bloc's ERM-2 exchange rate mechanism - a waiting room of at least two years, that precedes euro membership.
Bulgaria has made several commitments in a letter sent to euro zone authorities before the finance ministers' meeting to strengthen its banking sector and its anti-money laundering systems.
""We stand ready to work closely with Bulgaria in these areas so that they can join both the ERM-2 and the banking union, which is, so to say, a stepping stone toward joining the euro area,"" the EU Commission's vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis told journalists before the meeting on Thursday.
""Following on this work on these pre-commitments there will be formal Bulgaria's application for ERM-2,"" Dombrovskis said, noting that once an application is made to join the ERM-2, it could take just a few days to accept it.

766,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 10:30AM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar Steady at 1-1/2-Week Highs after U.S. Inflation Data,"Investing.com - The dollar was holding steady at one-and-a-half week highs against a currency basket on Thursday after data showing that U.S. inflation hit a six year high in June, underpinning expectations for two more rate hikes by the Federal Reserve this year.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was trading at 94.53 by 10:28 AM ET (14:28 GMT), having risen 0.67% on Wednesday.
Consumer inflation rose by an annualized 2.9% in June the Labor Department said. It was the highest rate since 2012.
On a monthly basis, prices rose by just 0.1%, slowing from 0.2% in May.
The figures came a day after data showing that U.S. producer prices posted the largest annual gain in six-and-a-half years in June, adding to signs of strength in the economy.
The reports indicated that even with the uncertainty arising around U.S. trade policy the Fed should remain on track to keep hiking interest rates this year.
Another report showed that initial jobless claims fell to a two month lows last week, as the labor market continues to tighten.
The dollar was trading near six-month highs against the yen, with USD/JPY last at 112.48, up 0.44% for the day.
The euro was little changed, with EUR/USD last at 1.1678, still well below Monday’s three-and-a-half week highs of 1.1790.
Earlier Thursday the minutes of the European Central Bank’s June meeting reiterated that interest will remain at current levels for as long as needed to raise inflation towards its target.
The ECB also warned that the increase in trade protectionism in recent months is hurting the European economy.

767,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",Yen Dethroned From Safe-Haven Perch in Brewing Trade War,"(Bloomberg) -- One might be forgiven for thinking the yen would be a beneficiary of the recent turmoil in markets -- the escalation of the trade war triggering a Pavlovian response luring traders to its safe-haven status. Not this time.
Since the start of July, the Japanese currency has been the weakest of its Group-of-10 peers. TD Securities LLC had to close out a bullish trade call stemming from the haven rationale, accepting a loss after the yen fell past 112.10 per dollar to its weakest since early January.
“We initiated this trade on the basis that trade tensions would worsen and undermine risk sentiment, both of which would weigh on 10-year U.S. Treasury yields,” said foreign exchange strategist Mazen Issa, in a note to clients Thursday. “While this narrative largely played out, USDJPY has broken away from traditional correlation structures and has pushed higher instead.”
The slide has baffled many in part because the decline has coincided with more understandable weakness in other currencies against the dollar. The greenback’s been a place of relative refuge from heightened trade risks amid a strong economic expansion, while Asian currencies like South Korea’s won and China’s yuan were rocked by growth concerns.
In Japan’s case, the economic data hasn’t budged and traders have long since wound back any hopes for the Bank of Japan tapering its stimulus. Similarly, interest-rate differentials that are often a driver of currency moves have remained largely stable.
Read here about how the trade war is killing volatility in currency markets.
The derivatives market might offer some clues to the recent weakness, with some traders saying options positioning suggests the sell-off has even further to run. U.S. inflation data due soon could also bring the 113 per dollar level within reach.
The yen was down 0.5 percent at 112.56 as of 12:29 p.m. in London on Thursday.
As for Issa, a break through technical levels increases the risk of a further decline in the yen, he said. And he has a new idea in mind as for how to profit from the trade woes.
“This augurs for patience,” he wrote. “ For now, we hold a preference to express trade risks through Canadian dollar shorts.”

768,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>","Hedge funds embrace China yuan short trade, but no doomsday in sight","By Simon Jessop and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - A record slide in the Chinese currency in June has paid rich dividends for some of the world's top macro hedge funds, though they say those trades do not reflect growing bets on an economic crash.
The world's second biggest economy certainly has its problems. It is exposed in any escalation of its trade conflict with Washington and its massive debt pile has raised concerns about the health of its banks and state-owned companies.
And betting against its yuan <CNY=CFXS>, either through the offshore markets <CNH=D3> or currency derivatives <CNYNDFOR=>, has been a hedge fund favorite for years.
Having laid heavy bets in 2015 and 2016 thinking China's red-hot economy would crash, those funds felt the heat as central bank intervention cushioned the currency's fall and made their short yuan trade too expensive to maintain.
While that play has faded since Beijing allowed more access to its onshore markets and tightened its grip, some hedge funds have continued to bet against the yuan for different reasons.
For Kevin Smith, chief investment officer at hedge fund Crescat Capital, June's record slide of more than 4 percent in the yuan against the dollar was vindication of a three-year-long bet the Chinese currency would weaken.
After originally paying off, it contributed more then 80 percent of the firm's 23 percent loss in 2017.
""We have been bearish on China for three years and went through the desert last year. It's something that really kicked in for us back in 2015 and is kicking in again for us now,"" Smith said.
Crescat used options to maintain a position at a cheaper cost last year and keeps the yuan devaluation theme among the $56 million fund's top trades.
""The options give us a way to stay in the game and have substantial exposure when it eventually moves and minimizes the downside. Using our risk controls, we were able to stay in it when a lot of other hedge funds... have really been forced out.""
(GRAPHIC: China Yuan risk reversals - https://reut.rs/2NCSeu5)
MOVING ON
In the summer of 2015 and early 2016, Hyman Capital and Corriente Advisors led the charge in betting against the Chinese economy via currency derivatives, which paid off when Beijing engineered a shock devaluation to stabilize its markets. Both funds declined to comment on current positions.
Those trades also peaked at a time when Beijing's ambitions to encourage the overseas usage of its currency fueled bets that China would find it difficult to stem an avalanche of capital outflows as its stock markets plunged.
But since then, China has taken steps to improve markets and allow more access to foreigners by launching investment channels between its big stock markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong.
""For hedge funds, the world has moved on from the view of a disorderly China devaluation,"" said Stephen Coltman, a senior investment manager on the Alternatives Investment strategies team at Aberdeen Standard Investments. While specialist currency funds were still playing moves in the yuan, macro hedge funds - which bet on macro-driven moves in stocks, indexes, rates and currencies - were largely absent.
That can be seen in the offshore derivatives market in non-deliverable forwards, which were not pricing massive yuan depreciation, Coltman said.
Forward prices on one-year offshore yuan contracts <CNHFOR=> show a discount of 56 pips from spot levels, but back in early-2016, the discount was more than 350 pips as concerns about a sharp slowdown in China convulsed markets.
Though a gauge of one-month <CNH1MRR=> and three-month <CNH3MRR=> risk reversals, a ratio of puts to calls, for the yuan have edged higher in recent days, it remains far below the levels of third quarter of 2015 and early 2016.
Yuan moves have also been more orderly this time.
As trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies escalated, the People's Bank of China let the renminbi <CNY=CFXS> weaken nearly 5 percent over 11 trading sessions from mid-June to an August 2017 low of 6.7204 yuan per dollar.
The currency is now holding near one-year lows.
Contrasting with the ""hard landing"" fears of 2015, most investors reckon that China's economy is on a strong footing, and yuan weakness could be just a policy-loosening tool, alongside targeted reserve requirement cuts.
""Our big data indicators on the ground are pointing to an upside risk to the consensus regarding economic activity."" said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, chief multi-asset strategist at BlackRock Investment Institute in London.
(GRAPHIC: Spread between offshore forwards and spot rate - https://reut.rs/2L9rG1V)
'NOSE-BLEEDING POSITIONS'
More importantly, the cost of running short yuan positions has made betting against Beijing an expensive business. With access to onshore markets improving, a falling offshore yuan pool - amounting to 600 billion yuan ($90 billion) compared to more than 1 trillion yuan in December 2014 - has meant short-sellers are vulnerable to sudden spikes in overnight funding costs as seen several times last year.
Even taking the currency derivatives route is relatively expensive. Implied volatility on the offshore yuan, a key input to pricing options, is more than its Asian counterparts.
""These are nose-bleeding positions to run over months and can drag on performance,"" said Kenneth Broux, a currency strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in London.
Greater China-focused hedge funds were down 4.18 percent in June, compared to global counterparts which posted flat returns in that period, according to data from Eurekahedge.
One late joiner was Bluebay Asset Management's Kaspar Hense, who started selling the offshore yuan at 6.45 per dollar last month, reckoning Beijing would accept the inflationary impact of a weaker currency.
While the yuan's drop has made his position far more profitable than expectations, he is not worried that it get out of hand and trigger an avalanche of capital outflows.
""We don't think the Chinese economy is in any danger and the currency losses are far more manageable to policymakers this time around,"" he said at the Mayfair-based fund which manages $60 billion.
Douglas Greenig, founder of Florin Court Capital, meanwhile, said he had profited from both the rising and falling currency in 2017 and 2018, as his quantitative fund models combed the market for trending prices and then leveraged those patterns to profit from them.
""The positioning seems much less extreme than (before)... When positioning is extended there are fewer people to come into the trade and push the trend further.""

769,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 04:11AM ET</span>",Dollar near 1 1/2-week highs as U.S. price data eyed,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar held at a nine-day high on Thursday, bolstered by concern U.S. inflation pressures will pick up, although worries about an escalation in trade conflict capped gains.
The conventional wisdom is that any escalation in trade conflict between the United States and its trading partners will feed through to inflation and prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at least twice more this year. But market watchers fear the dollar may have peaked for now.
With the stimulus effect from U.S. tax cuts expected to wane next year and worries that the trade war rhetoric may fuel a selloff in global stock markets, some analysts advise caution in buying the dollar at these levels.
""If stocks drop sharply then the Fed will pause and moreover, we think the U.S. is toward the end of its rate hike cycle,"" said Thu Lan Nguyen, an FX analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.
Having raised interest rates  seven times since December 2015 to 2 percent, markets expect three or four rate hikes by the end of 2019.
But despite the widening interest rate differentials in favor of the dollar -- spreads between 10-year U.S. Treasuries and equivalent German Bunds are near 30-year highs at 2.59 percent -- the dollar has failed to power ahead in recent days, notably against the euro.
Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh
Money managers at Russell Investments believe the risks of a U.S. recession are rising for late 2019, encouraging the dollar to hit a near-term peak.
The dollar gained 0.3 percent to 112.29 yen  after rising as much as 1.3 percent in U.S. trade on Wednesday, breaching the 112 barrier for the first time since Jan. 10.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies (DXY) edged up toward a one-week high of 94.769 reached overnight, trading at 94.753.
For now, investors were looking U.S. consumer inflation data due at 1230 GMT for further clues on when and how fast the Fed will raise interest rates.
The biggest annual increase in 6 1/2 years in June U.S. producer prices, thanks to gains in the cost of services and motor vehicles, set the scene for an upside surprise in the consumer price index numbers.

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists say the dollar may remain under pressure as the threat of protectionism rises. Damage to the profit margins of U.S. companies could prompt global investors to shy away from U.S. assets.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's lira weakened to a record low of 4.9767 against the dollar in overnight Asian trade before trimming losses on Thursday, hit by worries about economic management and monetary policy under Tayyip Erdogan's stronger executive presidency.
The lira <TRYTOM=D3> has shed about 22 percent of its value against the U.S. currency so far this year as investors fret over Erdogan's influence on monetary policy and his repeated calls for lower interest rates.
Hours after being sworn in with new powers as executive president on Monday, he appointed his son-in-law Berat Albayrak to the post of treasury and finance minister. This exacerbated concerns that Erdogan will look to exercise greater influence over monetary policy.
On Wednesday, local media quoted Erdogan as saying he believed interest rates would fall and that Albayrak will do what is necessary.
""We have many instruments. I believe we will see interest rates fall in the period ahead,"" the Hurriyet newspaper cited the president as telling reporters after his first foreign trip following the inauguration.
""I am sure not just our state banks but our private banks will shoulder responsibility if necessary.""
The lira weakened as far as 4.9767 in Asian trade before rebounding to 4.8320 at 0744 GMT on Thursday.
""Erdogan said yesterday interest rates must fall,"" said a treasury desk trader at one bank. ""This has been interpreted as a desire for a Turkish central bank rate cut at a time when additional tightening is expected and inflation has exceeded 15 percent.""
The central bank's monetary policy committee, which has raised rates by 500 basis points since April in an effort to put a floor under the currency, will next meet on July 24.
'FATHER OF ALL EVIL'
Erdogan has described high interest rates as ""the mother and father of all evil"" and has repeatedly expressed a desire for lower borrowing costs to spur economic growth.
Investors believe the credit-fueled economy is overheating and want decisive interest rate hikes to tame double-digit inflation.
Ratings agency Moody's on Thursday sounded concern about the outlook for the independence of the central bank, given changes this week that make the president solely responsible for appointing members of the bank's monetary policy committee, and shortened the length of the central bank governor's term.
Challenges to the effectiveness of the central bank are ""most clearly credit negative at this point"" Moody's said in a note.
""The changes to the governance of the central bank suggest that its resolve to tighten monetary policy to take the heat out of Turkey's economy, such as it is, may weaken rather than strengthen in the coming months.""
The main share index (XU100) was down 1 percent, adding to a 5 percent drop on Wednesday, and bringing its losses this year to more than 20 percent. Banking stocks (XBANK) were little changed after shedding more than 9 percent on Wednesday - their worst day for five years.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond (TR10YT=RR) rose to 18.79 percent from 18.37 percent on Wednesday.

The upbeat economic data helped offset concerns over international trade tensions. A trade spat between the U.S. and China escalated on Wednesday after Washington threatened to slap 10% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.
The tit-for-tat tariffs have fueled worries that the world’s two largest economies could descend into an all-out trade war, which investors fear could hit global growth.

(Reuters) - Investors trimmed their bearish positions on emerging Asian currencies over the past two weeks, a Reuters poll showed, although escalating Sino-U.S. tensions worsened the mid-term outlook for regional units.
Risky asset classes such as regional equities and currencies were battered over the past few months amid a deepening dispute on trade the United States and China.
President Donald Trump's administration on Tuesday threatened China with 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, prompting a tumble in equity and foreign exchange markets. China has threatened to retaliate, but did not specify how.
Recent dollar (DXY) strength also weighed on Asian units. The currency stood at a six-month high against the yen, bolstered by expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would hike interest rates two more times in 2018.
In Asia, bearish bets on the Chinese yuan <CNY=CFXS> eased slightly, the Reuters poll of 13 respondents showed. But a majority of poll responses came in before the U.S. announced the plan for much wider tariffs on China goods.
China's foreign exchange reserves unexpectedly rose in June, helped by an increase in the value of its U.S. Treasury holdings. June exports, to be announced on Friday, are also expected to have picked up, according to a Reuters poll.
However, many have expressed concerns over slowing economic growth in the country, and such worries have deepened following escalation of the trade fight with the U.S.
On Thursday, the yuan fell against the dollar following the central bank's weakest daily fixing in nearly a year and after Washington's fresh tariff threats knocked the currency lower.
In the poll, the Philippine peso <PHP=> had the highest level of bearish bets. The peso has been undercut by the country's weaker economic fundamentals this year.
The Philippines' trade deficit further widened in May to a five-month high.
Short positions on the ringgit <MYR=> narrowed, as sentiment about the currency was bolstered by Malaysia's solid economic fundamentals.
The Malaysian central bank kept its key interest rate steady on Wednesday, and said the economy was likely to ""remain on a steady growth path.""
Bearish positions on the Indian rupee <INR=IN> also fell slightly, although the currency has largely underperformed peers this year.
The rupee hit a record low against the dollar last month, hurt by rising oil prices as well as reduced risk sentiment over emerging markets.
Indian inflation likely climbed to a near two-year high in June, a Reuters poll showed. The readings, due at 1200 GMT on Thursday, may prompt the reserve bank to hike rates again in August.
Bearish positions on the Singapore dollar <SGD=> declined. However, its economy likely expanded at a slower pace in the second quarter as manufacturing lost momentum, a Reuters survey showed.
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.
The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

State media have been calling for calm, with the Xinhua News Agency saying recent moves in asset prices are within a controllable range.
""The fixing is likely to serve as the primary tool"" for intervention now, said Gao Qi, currency strategist at Scotiabank in Singapore. If that doesn’t work, then it’s likely officials will provide verbal support to slow the pace of the drop to avoid panic, he said.
The yuan was 0.3 percent lower at 6.6960 at 9:54 a.m. in Beijing, stronger than the offshore rate of 6.7120. The Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.6 percent after tumbling 1.8 percent on Wednesday. The gauge has fallen more than 20 percent from this year’s high. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index added 0.1 percent.
High-level trade talks between the U.S. and China have ground to a halt, according to five people familiar with the matter.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar rose near an 11-month high against the Chinese yuan and the Australian dollar tumbled after the U.S. said it would slap tariffs on an extra $200 billion of imports from China, sharply escalating tensions between the world's two biggest economies.
The news threw U.S.-China trade war worries back into the spotlight just days after Washington imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports, and Beijing responded immediately with matching tariffs on the same amount of U.S. exports to China.
The offshore Chinese yuan fell as low as 6.6918 per dollar <CNH=D4>, down more than 0.5 percent from late U.S. levels and edging near its 11-month low of 6.7344 touched on July 3.
The Australian dollar <AUD=D4> slipped 0.6 percent to $0.7417 from this week's high of $0.7484, which was its highest levels in more than three weeks.
The news also prompted knee-jerk selling of riskier assets against less vulnerable currencies.

The Aussie slumped 0.6 percent against the yen, changing hands at 82.30 yen.

""If China does react with further escalation in tariffs, the U.S. equity market as well as the dollar-yen or Australian dollar could face further downward pressures,"" he said.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the United States would impose tariffs of 10 percent on additional Chinese imports worth $200 billion.
The Trump administration released a wide-ranging list of Chinese goods it wants to hit with tariffs, including hundreds of food products as well as tobacco, coal, chemicals and tires, dog and cat food, and consumer electronics including television components.
Administration officials said a two-month process would allow the public to comment on the proposed tariffs before the list is finalised.
The move came after U.S. President Donald Trump said last week the United States may ultimately impose tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods - roughly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year.
""Because Trump talked about the $500 billion figure, it was not a complete surprise. Yet markets will inevitably react to these types of news headlines,"" said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
""Since the new tariffs won't be in place for two months, markets could soon calm down, although we will have to see how share markets, especially Chinese shares, will react to this,"" he said.

779,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 07:00PM ET</span>",Philippine Peso Slump a Relief to Exporters,"(Bloomberg) -- The peso near a 12-year low is providing some relief to Philippine exporters, who risk losing some tax perks and are facing tighter labor policies, the top executive for the electronics and semiconductor industry said.
“In general, it’s a blessing that the peso has weakened,” Dan Lachica, head of the Semiconductor and Electronics Industries in the Philippines, Inc., said in an interview. Even if 70 percent of the industry’s inputs are imported and affected by the 6.7 percent drop in the peso, with revenues in U.S. currency “you’re able to stretch the value of your earnings.”
What alarms SEIPI, the nation’s largest grouping of foreign and local electronics companies, is the government’s push to remove tax perks and its crackdown on labor contracting amid higher production costs as faster inflation trims the purchasing power of the peso, Lachica said on July 9. The peso is among the worst performers in Asia this year along with the Indian rupee and Indonesian rupiah.
The industry, which accounts for about half of Philippine exports, is only now regaining its footing as foreign investors get used to President Rodrigo Duterte’s outbursts against the U.S. during his first year in office in 2016, said Lachica. Recent challenges may slow the recovery in exports, which grew 11 percent in 2017 after a dismal 0.1 percent gain in 2016.

Shipments of electronics and semiconductors are forecast to rise 6 percent this year even as total exports contracted for a fifth month in May, Lachica said. The 320-member SEIPI, which accounts for about 10 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, targets to increase total shipments to more than $50 billion by 2030 compared with $32.7 billion as of end-2017.

Investec Bank Plc, PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC). and Svenska Handelsbanken AB all see China’s currency strengthening in the second half even as bigger-name forecasters have rushed to cut their projections. Among their reasons for the yuan’s advance are a falling dollar, an anticipated easing of China-U.S. trade tensions and the willingness of the Chinese authorities to defend the currency.
The yuan is the worst-performing currency in Asia since mid-June, sliding more than 3 percent, hurt by China’s move to relax its monetary stance to counter growth threats including rising tariffs. The slump prompted global investment banks from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) to  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV to weaken their year-end estimates for the yuan on a potential worsening of the trade frictions.
""We suspect that the dollar is at or very close to its peak,"" said Investec economist Ryan Djajasaputra, who predicts the yuan will rise more than 4 percent to 6.35 versus the greenback by year-end. ""You will see some stability on the trade front and therefore perhaps a degree of appreciation in the yuan over the next 6 to 18 months.""
Bill Adams, senior economist at PNC Financial Services -- who like Djajasaputra accurately predicted the yuan’s second-quarter slide -- says dollar weakness will help the yuan rally to 6.58 by the end of 2018.
Adams shares the view that the tariffs the U.S. imposes on imports from China are ""likely to be less onerous than feared."" He also says a recovery by the euro and pound could lead to ""a weaker overall outlook"" for the greenback. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has slipped 1.2 percent since climbing to its highest in nearly a year on June 27.
China’s currency will strengthen to 6.55 per dollar toward year-end, said Bjarke Roed-Frederiksen, senior economist at Sweden’s Svenska Handelsbanken, in part because China will intervene and use other measures if needed to guarantee exchange-rate stability.
China’s authorities have already voiced support for the yuan to keep it from sliding, with officials from the People’s Bank of China speaking up last week. Some major Chinese banks sold the dollar after the yuan fell past 6.7 per greenback on July 3, a move that strengthened the currency, according to traders who asked not to be named.
""A key concern of China’s government is stability,"" said Investec’s Djajasaputra. ""If the trade situation deteriorated and the yuan witnessed further downward pressure, we would expect the authorities to step in, particularly if there were signs of capital flight.""

The dollar was also higher against the yen, with USD/JPY climbing 0.33% to 111.19, the most since May 21.
Demand for the dollar continued to be underpinned by expectations for a faster pace of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve this year.

UK economic growth picked up to 0.3% in May from 0.2% in April, according to the first ever monthly GDP figures released earlier Tuesday.
The report painted a mixed picture of the economy, with modest growth driven by the services sector, partly offset by falling construction and industrial output.
Some analysts believe the data will keep the Bank of England on track for an August interest rate hike, but others fears that political instability may prompt policymakers to hold off.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is facing down a rebellion in her Conservative Party after Boris Johnson resigned as British foreign secretary on Monday, becoming the third minister to quit the government in twenty-four hours, rather than back her plans for a soft Brexit.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The British pound was frail on Tuesday after the departure of two key eurosceptic ministers raised worries about a ""hard Brexit"" while the yen retreated against the dollar as investors bid up riskier assets.
Sterling stood at $1.3248 , having fallen to as low as $1.3189 on Monday, after Prime Minister Theresa May's foreign minister and Brexit negotiator quit in protest at her plans to keep close trade ties with the European Union.
The currency regained some ground after several Conservative lawmakers said May is likely safe from a leadership challenge despite the resignation of Boris Johnson and Brexit minister David Davis.
Still, after two years of wrangling, their departures shatter May's own proclamation of cabinet unity last Friday in what she believed was an agreement on Britain's biggest foreign and trading policy shift in almost half a century.
Simon Derrick, London-based chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon, said the next few weeks could prove decisive, noting that financial markets have a poor track record of pricing in UK political risks, not to mention the 2016 Brexit referendum.
""Current thinking is that May would win a party confidence vote. However, there is a risk that were May to make further compromises in the negotiations with Brussels, more hard line Conservative MPs might be theoretically prepared to abstain or even vote against her in a no confidence vote in Parliament,"" he said.
Markets still expect it is likely the Bank of England (BOE) will hike rates at its next policy meeting on Aug. 2, but analysts said a full-blown political crisis could dent those expectations.
""Uncertainty is conquering the market at the moment regarding the possibility of a rate hike in August,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
""If there were some negative comments about a possible rate hike from BOE officials ahead of the August (Monetary Policy Committee meeting), then we will see a big fall in sterling,"" he said.

The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies (DXY), (=USD) fell to as low as 93.711 on Monday, its lowest since mid-June, and last stood at 94.098.
The dollar was not helped by Friday's data showing U.S. wage growth remained tame despite a tight labor market.
That kept the euro firm, trading at $1.1751 (EUR=), not far from three-week highs of $1.17905 touched on Monday.
The common currency strengthened to one-month high of 1.16565 Swiss franc (EURCHF=) on Monday. Against the yen, it traded at 130.515 yen (EURJPY=), retreating slightly after hitting a seven-week high of 130.57 yen.
The Japanese currency weakened against the dollar as investors appeared to be putting aside concerns of the trade conflict between the U.S. and China for now.
The dollar changed hands at 111.045 yen , above the 111-yen handle for the first time since last Tuesday.
The Chinese yuan tacked on 0.1 percent in offshore trade to 6.6114  against the dollar.

786,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 09, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>",Foreign Funds Keep Pouring Into China Despite the Yuan's Jitters,"(Bloomberg) -- The sharpest decline of China’s yuan since a turbulent devaluation in 2015 hasn’t fazed international bond funds, suggesting their diversification flows will be a useful stabilizing force for the nation’s policy makers.
“The falling yuan is a concern, but as long as it’s not in a severe downtrend, it’s not the biggest consideration when we’re investing in local-currency bonds in China,” said Manu George, director of fixed income at Schroder Investment Management Ltd. in Singapore, in a view echoed by other market participants.
June saw the yuan’s biggest monthly drop against the dollar since 1994, yet overseas investors poured the most into China’s domestic bonds in almost two years. The contrast is a testament to foreign demand for exposure to the country’s $12 trillion bond market, the world’s third-largest. China has steadily opened to international investors in part to provide a balance against domestic pressures to ferret money out.
The sustained inflows are also important for China’s borrowing costs, because overseas investors have replaced domestic banks as the dominant marginal player in the government bond market this year. Their purchases have helped lower the yield on China’s 10-year notes by the most in Asia -- and among emerging markets more broadly.
While the yuan’s slide from mid-June stoked speculation China’s leadership was turning to depreciation as a weapon against U.S. President Donald Trump’s protectionist trade moves, the country’s monetary authorities have pledged a stable currency. It rose for the third session out of the past five on Monday, trading around 6.62 per dollar in Shanghai.
Rather than getting spooked as in 2015, when China was battling against fears of an economic hard landing, market players this time around see a weaker yuan as part of an supportive monetary stance that should prove good for bonds. And with the trade battle threatening to curb growth, Chinese policy makers also have cause to go easy on financial deleveraging, which has hammered the corporate debt market.
“Allowing yuan depreciation is part of a directed policy of easing,” said Pierre-Yves Bareau, chief investment officer for emerging-market debt at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s asset management unit in London. “We don’t think this has parallels to the drop in 2015. Policy makers are fully in control and anchoring the situation.”
Ji Tianhe, a China strategist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA, went so far as to expect that “some investors would deem the depreciation a buying opportunity, as the slide creates room for future appreciation.”
Not all has been so rosy for China’s assets. Foreigners initially jumped into domestic stocks newly available in MSCI Inc.’s international indexes from the start of last month, but inflows have tailed off in the past three weeks as the yuan slid.
Net purchases via the stock connect with Hong Kong amounted to 3.2 billion yuan ($484 million) in the three weeks through July 6, compared with 48.5 billion yuan the prior three weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The CSI 300 Index has slumped 7.8 percent since June 15, in yuan terms.
In wake of the 2015-16 capital-flight scare, Chinese authorities have been increasingly encouraging foreign-investment inflows to help balance demand for the yuan. Inclusion in international bond indexes is another objective officials continue to work on, a move that could prompt further diversification inflows.
At 1.36 trillion yuan, foreign holdings of China’s bonds are still relatively limited, People’s Bank of China data show. That amounts to little more than the equivalent of what Hong Kong holds in U.S. Treasuries alone.
“Improving market infrastructure and solving technical issues play a larger role when asset managers decide whether to invest in China” than the yuan, said Johnny Chen, a portfolio manager for Asian local-currency bonds at NN Investment Partners Ltd. in Singapore. That includes the capability for block trading, delivery versus payment settlement and more clarification on taxes, he said.
Hedging is also important, and increasingly available. Turnover of futures tied to the offshore yuan against the dollar at Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. surged to a record on July 3, driving the notional value to $2.2 billion, data from the bourse showed. The onshore yuan slid through 6.7 that day, spurring officials to offer their reassurance.
Among the comments, Guo Shuqing, who heads the banking regulator and serves as Communist Party chief at the central bank, said the yuan should strengthen in time.
That’s the bet of Andy Seaman, chief investment officer at Stratton Street Capital LLP. Stratton recently increased its exposure to the yuan, anticipating that rising productivity will help keep China’s current-account surplus in tact for the long haul.

787,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 09, 2018 01:00PM ET</span>",The Pound’s Fate Hangs On Johnson's Replacement,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The face of Brexit has turned away. Boris Johnson stepped down as Foreign Minister on Monday, joining David Davis, the recently departed Brexit secretary, outside the big tent of British government.
With their departure, May has rid herself of the two most challenging members of her cabinet. The question for sterling is whether she gives herself a headache of her own making.
The political flaps gave the currency a tough time. I wrote that the pound’s weakness was best understood as a case of dollar strength, underpinned by the fact that the vast majority of May’s cabinet had stood behind her soft-Brexit plan. Johnson’s resignation showed that traders have their limits in looking through the shifting winds of domestic politics – the pound gave up all of its gains, to wind up back where it was on Friday. 
Assuming May avoids an immediate leadership challenge, what matters for sterling now is who replaces Johnson. Michael Gove, environment secretary, is a face that’s friendly for Brexiteers. Liam Fox, secretary for international trade, would also be someone they could live with. Either would be fine for the role.
With both of them remaining on board, alongside Dominic Raab as Davis’s replacement, there’s sufficient representation from the Brexit camp in the positions that are key for the outcome of the divorce. This will go a long way to getting backbenchers to accept May’s vision of a softer Brexit, making its realization much more likely. This should be reassuring for sterling. 
This arrangement would by no means suggest that she has anything like a clear path through to the end of March. The European Union has yet to give its assessment on her proposal, and they could continue with their line that the U.K. offering is insufficient. A “no deal” Brexit can’t be ruled out. Having played hardball with her cabinet, she would be left having to play hardball with Brussels.
There’s a way the outcome could be much, much worse for the currency. Were Gove to resign, May’s Conservative party would fracture – if it hasn’t already. Leave aside who would win a leadership challenge – the point for Brexit is that it would delay the divorce negotiations for three months. 
That’s a terrible outcome for sterling, as it makes a “no-deal” Brexit much more likely. On the current timetable, by October the whole structure of the deal should have been pretty much agreed by both the U.K. and EU. A leadership challenge would make this impossible to achieve. 
And the pain would be doubled. The collapse of May’s progress would make it much harder for the Bank of England to raise its key interest rate next month. Governor Mark Carney had predicated policy makers’ projections on a smooth exit from the bloc, and now that would be extremely unlikely. In that environment, sterling could start making its way toward the lows it achieved after the referendum in 2016. 
Johnson’s departure was news for the pound. But what really matters is what happens next."

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.06% to 93.82, after trading as low as 93.44.
GBP/USD came under heavy pressure, falling 0.48% to $1.3222 after Johnson resigned over the prime minister's Brexit plans.
Johnson's resignation raises the prospect of a no-confidence vote in May's leadership, though it's unlikely that most ministers of Parliament would vote to remove the prime minister, according to JPMorgan.
""At this stage, we don't see any signs that majority of Conservative MPs are set to turn against May, even if they do not see her as leader of the party for the long run,"" JPMorgan said.
Johnson had resigned a day after David Davis quit as UK Brexit Secretary. Davis claimed May's Brexit plan was ""dangerous,"" as it gave away too much too easily.
Political uncertainty and a soft Brexit, however, will do little to sway the Bank of England from hiking rates in August amid a recent string of strong UK economic data, AllianceBernstein said.
""The best possible scenario for markets is a soft Brexit delivered by the Conservative party,"" which would enable rate increases,"" AllianceBernstein said.
Elsewhere, the greenback was also supported by easing trade war fears, pressuring safe-haven currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc lower.
USD/JPY rose 0.33% to Y110.83, while USD/CHF rose 0.22% to 0.9921.

789,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2018 12:23PM ET</span>",Sterling slides as foreign minister's resignation heaps pressure on May,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling slid on Monday after the resignation of the British foreign minister heaped pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May, but its losses were expected to be contained unless a full-blown leadership challenge materialized. 
Boris Johnson followed Brexit minister David Davis in resigning in opposition to May's hard-fought blueprint for how Britain is to structure its relationship with the European Union after its leaves the bloc in March.
That plan - announced on Friday - has been welcomed by markets, which believe it made the ""soft Brexit"" favored by businesses and investors more likely. 
Sterling had traded higher before Johnson's resignation as investors speculated May would find it easier to negotiate with Brussels without opponents to her vision of Brexit inside her cabinet.
""The danger is that PM May faces a no-confidence vote and the risk has grown that we will have a leadership challenge and a possible hard Brexit leadership facing the EU,"" said Kenneth Broux, FX strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
The British currency fell half a cent to as low as $1.3259  following Johnson's departure, after earlier trading as high as $1.3363, its strongest since June 14.
Sterling slid 0.3 percent versus the euro to 88.625 pence per euro .
Under May's Brexit plan, Britain and the EU would retain close trade ties. But Davis said he believed this would hand too much power to Brussels in the exit talks.
While Davis has said he would not seek to challenge May's leadership, Johnson's ambitions appear less clear.
""What we can say is the pound can handle ministerial resignations if that's the extent of it...if it means Johnson leaving and not launching a leadership challenge,"" said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING.
UK stocks, which benefit from sterling weakness, rose 0.9 percent (FTSE).
NO DISCIPLINE
The resignations have underlined May's limited ability to impose cabinet discipline around a softer Brexit strategy. 
But analysts said May's success in getting broad agreement for her plan for life after the EU was important, reflecting sterling's relatively muted moves on Monday.
Under the agreement announced by May on Friday, Britain will retain a close trading relationship with the EU, making the sort of arrangement business leaders have called for in recent weeks more likely. 
""It's a softer Brexit and it's a plan. A plan is better than no plan. The market is extrapolating that the EU will get more concessions out of the UK"", bringing the two sides toward something like a customs union as favored by markets, Nomura analyst Jordan Rochester said.
May named Brexit campaigner Dominic Raab as Davis's replacement. 
Broad-based dollar weakness also supported the pound's bounce, while data this week could raise expectations of a Bank of England interest rate rise in August if it suggest growing economic momentum in the second quarter. 
Markets are pricing in a 62 percent chance of a rate rise in August, down from 69 percent before Johnson quit. Ten-year British government bond yields slipped after news of Johnson's resignation (GB10YT=RR).
Sterling has climbed around 2 percent since hitting a 7-1/2 month low in late June, boosted by improving economic sentiment and signs that May had faced down the hard Brexiteers in her cabinet.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar recovered from a 3-1/2 week low on Monday as the pound dived following the announcement that UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson resigned from the government.
Sterling fell to a daily low of $1.324 after Johnson quit in protest over Prime Minister Theresa May's plans to leave the European Union. His was the second resignation in a day, leaving the British leader's Brexit plans in tatters.
Johnson decided to walk just hours after May's Brexit minister, David Davis, did the same over her EU plans. The pound rose half a percent  earlier in the European session as traders focused on the increased likelihood of a ""soft Brexit"" in which the UK and EU retain close trade ties. But the second exit provoked a risk-off response in the market. 
The dollar index rose 0.4 percent against a basket of six major currencies (DXY) to a daily high of 94.068. Other safe-haven currencies also benefited. 
Against the pound, the Swiss franc (GBPCHF=) strengthened to a daily low of 1.312. The sterling/Japanese yen cross rate also fell to a daily low of 146.56. 
Earlier in the trading day, the dollar index had fallen 0.4 percent from Friday to 93.713, its lowest since June 14, after U.S. wages indicators disappointed dollar bulls while boosting risk appetite.
In spite of the dollar's recovery on the back of the pound, the Chinese yuan maintained its gains after it rebounded as investors bought riskier assets following favorable U.S. jobs data last week and evidence that global trade tension has not yet slowed economic momentum.
Friday's data showed average U.S. hourly earnings gained five cents, or 0.2 percent, in June after rising 0.3 percent in May. This suggested moderate inflation pressures, creating doubt that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates a total of four times in 2018.
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 213,000 in June, more than expected, the data showed.
Investors appear to be ignoring the worsening trade conflict between the United States and China after the two countries imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of each others' goods on Friday
""There was nothing really surprising"" in Friday's trade announcement, said Omer Eisner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc. ""China’s response was measured and as a result I think we’ve seen the overall risk sentiment in markets improve."" 
The yuan rose more than half a percent in offshore markets to 6.614 against the dollar , putting it on course for its biggest one-day rise in more than three months and further away from June's lows - its biggest-ever monthly decline.

792,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 09, 2018 05:10AM ET</span>",JPMorgan Maps Out Currencies to Buy If Recession Is Coming,"(Bloomberg) -- If a U.S. or global recession is looming, it’s time to own the Swiss franc, Singapore dollar, U.S. dollar and Japanese yen -- and ditch emerging market currencies, according to analysts from JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).
“Recessions are when creditors get to ask for their money back,” analysts including Paul Meggyesi said in a note dated July 6. “Three of the top four currencies to own during a recession are those of countries that boast extremely strong external positions.”
The yen is the cheapest of the recessionary hedges, while the Singapore dollar is the least attractive, the team concluded. The U.S. currency benefits because, as the world’s default funding currency, the rest of the world needs to buy back dollars when banks and companies deleverage during recessions, the JPMorgan strategists said. The greenback has already been outperforming in recent months as trade tensions escalated.
For the record, the team said talk of a recession at this point is “premature,” though concluded it “sensible” to review contingency plans amid the likelihood of a further escalation in trade tensions.
Emerging market currencies are a “clear stand-out” as particularly susceptible to slowdowns, depreciating on average by 17 percent over a two-year period straddling the start of a recession, JPMorgan said. The New Zealand dollar is “by far” the worst performer among the G10 currencies in a recession, losing an average 7 to 8 percent, the report said.
JPMorgan drew on research of currency performance over the last five recessions. While the yen historically had less impressive performance than the other three key hedges, this time around its real effective exchange rate -- a measure that adjusts for relative inflation and trade flows -- is 23 percent below its 40-year average. Ahead of the last three recessions, it was 8 percent overvalued, the bank calculated.
That means Japan’s currency should “form a central part of any recessionary hedge,” the strategists wrote. JPMorgan forecasts the yen to appreciate to 108 per dollar in September and 106 in December. It was at 110.51 as of 6:06 p.m. in Tokyo.
The bank separately said the dollar should extend recent gains against the euro after improved economic data from the 19-nation currency zone.
“This week we increase our overall long position in European FX through euro-dollar as European data surprises have now edged ahead of the U.S. and could support another 1 to 2 percent rally in the European bloc,” Meggyesi and his colleagues wrote.

795,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2018 12:54AM ET</span>","China's FX reserves post surprise gain, withstand June market chaos","By Yawen Chen and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's foreign exchange reserves unexpectedly rose in June, bolstered by an increase in the value of its U.S. Treasury holdings in an otherwise volatile month for Chinese markets, which were battered by fears about a Sino-U.S. trade war.
Reserves rose $1.51 billion in June to $3.112 trillion, compared with a drop of $14.23 billion in May, central bank data showed on Monday. Economists polled by Reuters had expected reserves to drop by $10.6 billion to $3.10 trillion.
China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said in a statement the small increase in reserves was due to asset price changes but did not provide details.
Analysts pointed to the performance of U.S. bonds in June, which are believed to make up a major part of China's reserves.
""U.S. Treasury yields were down in June, so valuation factors were conducive to an increase in foreign reserves,"" said Er Yongjian, chief financial analyst at Bank of Communications.
Fears about a global trade war were among the factors in June that drove investment flows into safe haven assets, such as U.S. government bonds.
China is the largest holder of U.S. government debt. Its holdings fell to $1.182 trillion in April from $1.188 trillion in May, data from the U.S. Treasury Department showed. China also invests its reserves in other U.S. instruments as well as sovereign debt of other countries.
At the same time, the U.S. dollar index rose slightly by 0.7 percent in June, compared with a sharper gain of 2.3 percent in May, according to Thomson Reuters data.
""The impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar on foreign exchange reserves in June was not as big as in May,"" said Wen Bin, chief analyst at China Minsheng Bank.
China's currency and equity markets had been on edge ahead of July 6, when U.S. tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods kicked in. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on U.S. products of the same value.
The heightened Sino-U.S. trade tensions have sparked concerns of capital outflows from China and threatened to pile more pressure on the Chinese currency. 
In June, the yuan suffered its worst month on record, falling 3.3 percent against the U.S. dollar. June also represented the worst month for Chinese stocks in more than two years.
Capital flight was seen as a major risk for China at the start of 2017, but a combination of tighter capital controls and a faltering dollar helped the yuan stage a strong turnaround, bolstering confidence in the economy.
Last year, the yuan reversed three straight years of depreciation against the U.S. dollar and China's cross-border capital flows went from net outflows to basically stable. 
The yuan fell through a key psychological level of 6.7 on the U.S. dollar on July 3. The Chinese authorities made remarks the same day to assure markets it would keep the currency stable.
Market participants last week said major state-owned banks were seen swapping yuan for dollars in the forwards market and immediately selling them into the spot market to prop up the Chinese currency.
Despite the market tumult in recent weeks, China appears broadly comfortable with a weakening yuan and would intervene only to prevent any destabilizing declines or to restore market confidence, policy insiders told Reuters.
Authorities are also confident they won't have to make heavy use of the official foreign exchange reserves to defend the yuan as they did during 2015 when stocks and the currency went into a tailspin.

The value of China's gold reserves fell to $74.071 billion at the end of June, from $77.323 billion at the end of May.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's lead as the top European destination for international investment in financial services is starting to narrow as continental rivals vying for its business are boosted by Brexit, according to a report published on Monday.
The report, by accounting and consulting firm EY, found that the UK hosted just 14 more foreign investment projects in financial services last year than second-placed Germany, down from a gap of 67 in the previous year. 
The number of projects in the UK fell 26 percent in 2017, compared to an increase of 64 percent in Germany, 123 percent in France and 13 percent across Europe as a whole. 
Britain's EU neighbors have looked to capitalize on uncertainty over its future access to European markets to encourage financial firms to set up shop in their own countries, in a challenge to its long-established reputation as the European capital for the sector. 
Omar Ali, EY's UK financial services leader, said Britain hung on to the top spot as factors like its talent, infrastructure and robust regulatory and legal systems were hard to replicate overseas. 
""But we can't ignore the drop in investment and forward-looking sentiment - investors are sending a clear message that answers are needed on future trading arrangements, access to skills and the UK's future approach to the economy.""
UK financial services attracted 78 foreign investment projects last year, down from a record 106 in 2016, EY said. Germany, in second place, won 64, while France saw 49, up from 39 and 22 respectively. 
Ireland saw its number increase from 12 to 28, while Luxembourg attracted 17 projects compared to 2 in 2016. 
For global financial firms that rely on Britain's membership of the EU to run their European operations, slow progress in Brexit negotiations has stoked fears that their access to the bloc could be restricted or even shut off altogether after March 2019, when Britain leaves. 
This has prompted many to enact plans for a worst-case scenario, which usually involve shifting some of their British operations on to the continent to protect them even if Britain crashes out of the bloc with no deal. 
Some banks, including  Barclays  (L:BARC) and JPMorgan (N:JPM), have already started moving some of their staff elsewhere.
""The question is, will this be a temporary shift or the start of a more sustained trend?"" Ali said. 
A survey conducted by EY as part of the report found that two-thirds of global financial firms hadn't changed their investment plans following the Brexit vote, and 75 percent said they had no plans to relocate to the continent.

Retaining strong trading arrangements with the EU was cited by 39 percent of investors as key to ensuring the UK remains attractive in future, with 33 percent saying the same for trade deals with new countries and 31 percent highlighting incentives for foreign investors.

797,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 08, 2018 06:08AM ET</span>",Forex - Weekly Outlook: July 9 - 13,"Investing.com - This week’s U.S. inflation data will be closely watched, while a Bank of Canada policy meeting and a look at UK monthly economic growth will also be in focus.
On Thursday, U.S. inflation data is expected to point to a 2.9% annual increase in the consumer price index, which could underpin the Federal Reserve’s case for a gradual pace of rate hikes this year.
The BoC is widely expected to hike interest rates by a quarter point following its meeting on Thursday, bringing rates to 1.5%, but heightened uncertainty over U.S. trade policy mean that the bank could still decide to hold fire.
On Tuesday, market watchers will get a first look at figures on UK monthly growth that could bolster expectations for a rate hike by the Bank of England in August.
Trade developments will also be in the spotlight after new U.S.-China trade tariffs came into effect on Friday.
The dollar slid lower against a currency basket on Friday after data showing that while the U.S. economy created more jobs than expected in June, wage growth rose at a slower than expected pace and the unemployment rate ticked higher.
The Department of Labor said nonfarm payrolls increased by 213,000 last month, while wage growth remained moderate and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4% from an 18-year low of 3.8% in May.
Sluggish wage growth figures slightly dimmed expectations for a fourth rate hike by the Federal Reserve this year.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.39% to 93.76 late Friday. For the week, the dollar was down 0.61%.
The dollar had already come under pressure earlier in the day after the U.S. and China imposed tariffs on each other’s imports, escalating a trade spat that many investors fear will hit global growth.
The dollar was lower against the safe haven yen, with USD/JPY losing 0.17% to trade at 110.46.
The euro gained ground, with EUR/USD rising 0.47% to 1.1744, while the pound also pushed higher, with GBP/USD up 0.48% to 1.3286 in late trade.

798,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 06, 2018 12:56PM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar Falls on Mixed Jobs Report,"Investing.com – The dollar slumped against its rivals Friday, on mixed U.S. economic data showing the economy created more jobs than expected but wage growth undershot estimates.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.34% to 93.81.
The U.S. economy added 213,000 jobs in June, above forecasts for 200,000 new jobs while the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 4%, the Labor Department said on Friday.
The Federal Reserve's view that a tighter labor market would lead to wage growth, increasing inflationary pressures, continues to be challenged as average hourly earnings grew slower-than-expected for the month.
Average hourly earnings grew 0.2%, undershooting economists' forecast for a 0.3% increase.
The weaker average hourly earnings print scaled back some bullish investor expectations for two Fed rate hikes this year.
""The softer average earnings indicator is likely to catch more attention as it highlights a still tame wage inflation environment,"" said Audrey Childe-Freeman, chief strategist at consultants FX Knowledge. ""That could lead some market participants to start questioning whether we will see two Fed rate rises in second after all.""
The dollar was also weighed down by an uptick in the Canadian dollar as upbeat employment data, reaffirmed investor expectations that the Bank of Canadian would hike interest rates by 25 basis points next week.
USD/CAD fell 0.33% to C$1.3090
U.S, and China trade tariffs kicked in Friday, raising the prospect of a trade war between the world's largest economic superpowers, but the reaction in safe-haven currencies was muted, as some said markets had priced in the impact.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.47% to 93.69 as of 11:14 AM ET (15:14 GMT).
Trade conflict between the two biggest economies in the world began in force on Friday, when U.S. tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods went into effect at 12:01 AM ET (04:01 GMT). Additional tariffs on another $16 billion in goods are expected to go into effect in two weeks. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has given instructions to identify tariffs on a further $300 billion in possible Chinese goods.
China has also retaliated with tariffs on $34 billion of American goods, according to Xinhua news. Beijing had previously said it would impose tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, crude imports, and vehicle products.
The dollar was lower against the safe-haven yen, with USD/JPY decreasing 0.18% to 110.45. In times of uncertainty, investors tend to invest in the Japanese yen, which is considered a safe asset during periods of risk aversion.
On the data front, the U.S. added more jobs than expected in June, indicating a strengthening economy. However wage inflation rose less than expected, which could lower expectations for an interest rate increase. The increase in wages is being closely monitored by the Federal Reserve for evidence of diminishing slack in the labor market and upward pressure on inflation.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's dollar will climb over the coming year, a Reuters poll showed, but forecasters are less bullish than they were a month ago as escalating trade uncertainty competes with expected Bank of Canada interest rate hikes. 
The poll of more than 40 foreign exchange strategists predicted the Canadian dollar will rise to C$1.30 to the greenback, or 76.92 U.S. cents, in three months, from around C$1.3140 on Thursday.
The currency is expected to climb further to C$1.26 in a year, versus C$1.25 in the June poll.
Hawkish comments last week by Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz have left money markets largely expecting the central bank to lift its benchmark interest rate, which sits at 1.25 percent, by 25 basis points next week. 
Up to three further tightenings are seen by the end of 2019, which would lift the policy rate to 2.25 percent. That would match the prediction of a Reuters poll. 
Eric Theoret, a currency strategist at Scotiabank, expects the Bank of Canada to hike more aggressively than the market expects, giving the loonie a boost. He looks for the central bank to tighten five times over the next 18 months to a rate of 2.50 percent.
""It is a function of Canada being at or even above its potential (output) and the growth outlook supporting a push beyond that,"" Theoret said.
The potential for the U.S. dollar to weaken over the coming year could also raise prospects for the loonie.
""We are generally bearish on the U.S. dollar,"" said Daniel Katzive, head of FX strategy North America at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) in New York. ""That reflects the end of the Fed cycle and the softening of the U.S. economy as we head through 2019.""
A weaker U.S. dollar could help support the price of commodities, which are some of Canada's major exports. The price of U.S. crude oil (CLc1) has traded this week at its highest in three-and-a-half years.
But Canada is also dependent on the export of autos. Its economy could be badly hurt if U.S. President Donald Trump, who has already slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada, follows through on a threat to impose auto tariffs.
Another headwind for Canada, which sends about 75 percent of its exports to the United States, is slow-moving talks to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement.
""Any sort of resolution on NAFTA could be a while yet,"" said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist at TD Securities. ""We are still quite bearish (on the Canadian dollar) in the near-term.""
Canada runs a current account deficit so its economy could be hurt also if the global flow of trade or capital slows.
""As the dynamics between the U.S. and China continue to escalate, the risk you run is that CAD will be caught in the crossfire,"" Issa said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Friday as the United States and China slapped tariffs on the other's imports, but a muted reaction in currency markets suggested the escalation had largely been priced in by investors focusing on a U.S. jobs report due later in the day.
The latest salvo in a trade conflict between the world's biggest economic powers was fired on Friday when U.S. tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods came into effect.
Investors are anxious to know whether the latest tariffs were a continuation of tit-for-tat measures or an escalation between the two countries which could cause volatility in global financial markets.
The immediate response among major currencies on Friday was limited.
""The first batch of tariffs is a milestone in the trade war but a very well-telegraphed one,"" said Elsa Lignos, global head of FX strategy, at RBC Capital Markets in London.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies fell 0.2 percent to an intraday low of 94.195 (DXY) after weakening to 94.177 the previous day, its lowest since June 26.
That helped the euro rise to $1.1727 (EUR=EBS), its strongest since June 26.
The euro is enjoying a boost from strong German industrial orders and signs Washington has softened its trade rhetoric toward European Union automakers.
The Australian dollar, a liquid proxy to China-related trades, rose 0.3 percent to $0.7419 .
The Japanese yen, which usually acts as a safe-haven currency during times of economic and political uncertainty, traded flat against the dollar. 
The U.S. Labor Department is expected to report non-farm payrolls grew by 195,000 in June after surging by 223,000 in May. Monthly average hourly earnings probably rose 0.3 percent, taking the annual increase to 2.8 percent from 2.7 percent in May.
""Any misses in today's data could spur a wave of profit-taking - given signs that the U.S. dollar rally looks to be running out of steam,"" said analysts at ING.
The pound was effectively flat at $1.3235 . It had reached a nine-day high of $1.3275 on Thursday after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said he was confident an economic slowdown was temporary, but the rise faded before Friday's government meeting on Brexit policy.
Prime Minister Theresa May will propose a new plan to ease trade and offer Britain more freedom to set import tariffs, a last-ditch attempt to unite her government on plans for leaving the European Union.

China's yuan was 0.1 percent weaker at 6.6480 per dollar  but still some distance from Tuesday's 11-month low of 6.7204. The yuan had retreated amid trade concerns before pulling back on assurances by China's central bank.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's stocks clawed back earlier losses on Friday but lengthened a string of weekly declines as Washington's tariffs on Chinese goods took effect, escalating the trade row between the world's two largest economies.
The yuan weakened against the dollar on the day.
The United States imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports at 0401 GMT Friday. Beijing said it had no choice but to respond in kind, but was yet to outline the full extent of any retaliatory measures.
The benchmark CSI300 Index (CSI300) closed up 0.7 percent, but was still down 4.2 percent for the week, its fifth consecutive weekly loss.
The Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) ended up 0.5 percent after flirting with two-year lows in the morning session. It ended the week 3.5 percent lower, its seventh straight week of losses.
Market participants said some investors were buying beaten-down stocks following this week's selloff, but said the market continued to face significant uncertainties.
""Sentiment is holding up well in Asia today, reflecting that tariffs on $34 billion of goods is pretty much priced in,"" said Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro strategy at Westpac in Singapore. ""Now to see if there is anything unexpected ... over the weekend.""
A Shanghai-based hedge fund manager, who declined to be identified, said the jump looked like a ""self-initiated market rebound.""
The fund manager, who tracks big money flows for suspected state intervention, said she didn't see any evidence of buying from state investors to support the market.
""State intervention is bad for the market, as it only prolongs, rather than stems the market fall, if we're not yet at the bottom,"" she said.
Analysts said the outlook for shares remained shaky.
""The chances are slim for China and the U.S. to reach an agreement on trade issues, and trade war worries will be a long-term uncertainty for at least the next two years,"" said Yan Weixiao, an analyst with Founder Securities, adding that things could be ""dangerous"" for Chinese stocks.
Yan said the psychologically key level of 2,638 points for the SSEC, which was hit in March 2016, will probably be broken.
As stocks turned around, Chinese treasury futures fell. Chinese 10-year treasury futures for September delivery , the most-traded contract, were 0.26 percent lower at 95.590.
China's yuan  was slightly weaker, at 6.6515 to the dollar.
""The market has already digested (the news of tariff implementation),"" said Ken Cheung, senior Asian FX analyst at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong. ""Unless there is an escalation, the yuan is unlikely to have a sizable decline.""
Gao Qi, FX strategist at Scotiabank, said in a note on Friday he expected the Chinese authorities to step in to calm the market and prevent the yuan from sharply depreciating if need be.
""We see a strong resistance of 6.70 for now and the 6.90 level seems China's bottom line for the yuan exchange rate. The yuan will certainly face intensifying depreciation pressure again going forward if China fails to de-escalate trade tensions with the U.S.,"" he wrote.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - The forint and the zloty are seen mostly recovering from this week's record lows against the euro in the next year, after a dollar (DXY) rally caused a sell-off in emerging markets.
The median forecasts of 50 economists in a July 2-5 Reuters poll showed that the forint (EURHUF=) could firm about 2 percent and the zloty (EURPLN=) about 2.5 percent versus the euro in the next 12 months from their Thursday afternoon levels.
Among Central European currencies, Hungary's forint and the Polish zloty got the biggest hit from the past few months' rally in the dollar (DXY) and U.S. bond yields.
For a graphic on Central European central bank rates click https://reut.rs/2IVKlwb
They fell 5-6 percent against the euro from the end of 2017, with the forint touching record lows at 330.7 early this week, before a partial recovery after the Chinese central bank calmed markets and stopped a weakening of the yuan. 
The forint got additional help from growing expectations that the Hungarian central bank (NBH), after abandoning its pledge to keep rates low for years two weeks ago, could consider measures to tackle an increase in inflation risk.
When the forint was falling, some traders did not even rule out an emergency rate hike from the NBH because a weakening increases inflation by boosting the price of imported goods.
Analysts in the poll mostly said that the bank was unlikely to take any monetary tightening measure this month, unless the forint plunges again from Thursday's levels around 323.35.
Ten analysts said an emergency measure before the July 24 meeting was unlikely, and seven said the same about the July meeting, with no participant projecting a move.
ING analysts Peter Virovacz said the bank could rush into tightening only if renewed pressure sharply weakens the forint.
""If we reach 335-ish levels, than from an inflation point of view, NBH needs to take action,"" he said, adding that cutting liquidity provided by the NBH to banks could be a sufficient first measure, to be followed by an increase in the NBH's overnight deposit rate, now -0.15 percent, if needed.
Other analysts also said these measures were possible in the rest of the year if renewed forint weakness puts the bank's 2-4 percent inflation target at risk.
Most respondents refused to make projections about the NBH's likely policies in the next few months, or about the likely bottom of the forint, adding that the currency's path would be key to NBH policy tightness, and it was uncertain.
The key global uncertainties are the impacts of a global trade war on economic growth, the level of crude oil prices, and whether the dollar continues to channel liquidity away from other markets, analysts said.
A separate Reuters poll of analysts showed the dollar was not expected to firm further from levels around 1.17 against the euro. It was seen firming to 1.16 by the end of July, but retreating to 1.22 in the next 12 months.
""I do not understand why we should get into a bad spiral while Hungary has an external (trade and current account) surplus,"" said Gergely Suppan, an analyst at Takarekbank in Budapest. ""If the forint recovers, the bank will not have to do anything.""
According to the median forecasts in the poll, the forint is seen firming to 320 by the end of the year and to 317.25 by the end of June 2019, a weaker 12-month level than the 312 forecast in a similar survey a month ago.
The zloty, which traded around 4.355 against the euro on Thursday, is expected to gradually firm to 4.25 in the next 12 months, a weaker level than 4.2 predicted a month ago.
The recent sell-off also weakened the Czech crown (EURCZK=), but analysts kept their 24.85 one-year forecast for the currency unchanged as the Czech central bank is expected to continue to increase its interest rates.

805,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>","Swedish, Norwegian crowns seen strengthening against euro, dollar: Reuters poll","By Simon Johnson
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The Swedish and Norwegian currencies are set to strengthen against the euro over the next year, boosted by strong economies and higher interest rates, a Reuters poll forecast on Friday.
Both nations have seen their currencies slide over the last six years, reflecting ultra-loose monetary policy, housing market problems and in Norway's case, lower oil prices.
With both economies fundamentally strong, analysts have long considered the Norwegian and Swedish crowns as undervalued. But the cautious policies of the Norges Bank and the Riksbank have trumped wider economic trends.
Sweden's currency has had a bumpy ride in recent months. Even though it has lost around 20 percent of its value against the euro since summer 2012, the Riksbank remains worried that a gain for the crown would undermine its efforts to push up prices.
It has held rates at -0.50 percent since early 2016 and with inflation now back at 2 percent, the Riksbank has said it will start to hike toward the end of this year. 
But uncertainty remains about when it will resume raising rates. The policymakers themselves are divided on timing.
""The crown will start to strengthen as we approach a rate hike, whether that happens at the end of this year or next year,"" Elisabet Kopelman, an economist at SEB said. ""The crown is unreasonably weak at the current levels. It is negative rates that are the problem and maybe worries about a trade war to an extent.""
Overall, economists predicted the Swedish crown will strengthen to around 8.08 to the dollar  and 9.80 against the euro (EURSEK=) by this time next year.

Norway's crown has developed similarly, losing around 25 percent of its value against the euro in the last six years as the price of oil slumped. But a global economic pick-up has reversed some of the losses and Norway's economy has recovered. (LCOc1) 
Despite weaker-than-expected inflation in recent months, Norway's central bank has penciled in a rate increase in September from the current record low of 0.50 percent, citing higher oil prices, a strong housing market and faster growth.
The Norwegian crown is set to strengthen to around 7.38 against the dollar  and 9.10 against the euro (EURNOK=) over the next 12 months.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's rand is likely to cruise through the coming year but the outcome of a trade war between the United States and China could throw the currency off course, a Reuters poll showed on Friday. 
The survey, taken this week, indicates the rand  will fluctuate in the next 12 months against the dollar, and while the medians showed it would remain around 13.50, the range of forecasts was wide.
According to the most bearish forecaster it will weaken to 15.00 per dollar while the most bullish saw it at 11.15.
Economists and strategists were divided on how far the dollar can keep strengthening but Piotr Matys, an emerging-markets currency strategist at Rabobank, said a liquid currency like the rand is likely to remain on the back foot.
""The dollar should remain strong as the Federal Reserve continues to tighten interest rates,"" said Matys.
The South African Reserve Bank is expected to keep its repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent until 2020. It cut its main interest rate by 25 basis points to 6.50 percent in March. 
Last month, the U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight lending rate for the second time this year. It now sits in a range of 1.75 to 2 percent.
The Fed also upgraded its forecast to include another two rate rises this year, one more than projected in March.
""Another factor supporting the dollar against the emerging market currencies including the rand is this prevailing risk of a full-scale trade war between China and the United States,"" said Matys.
The rand has lost all the gains made when markets cheered Cyril Ramaphosa's new presidency at the beginning of the year, when many foresaw a ""new dawn"" that promised higher economic growth than under his predecessor Jacob Zuma. 
But the economy had a bad start to the year, confirming the uphill battle Ramaphosa is faced with to turn around the nation's fortunes and end social and economic inequality.
South Africa's economy is expected to grow 1.7 percent this year and 2.0 percent next.

U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that the tariffs would kick in at 12:01AM ET (04:01 GMT) on Friday. Trump told reporters that another $16 billion are expected to go into effect in two weeks, and that he is considering to impose additional tariffs on $500 billion in Chinese goods if Beijing retaliate.
First “34, and then you have another 16 in two weeks and then as you know we have 200 billion in abeyance and then after the 200 billion we have 300 billion in abeyance. Ok? So we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300,"" Trump said.
“It’s only on China,"" he added.
The USD/CNY pair climbed 0.32% to 6.6577 on Friday. Traders’ focus have now shifted to how China reacts as markets fear the potential volatility would cloud the global economic outlook. Chinese officials have said earlier that it would retaliate against Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods.
""The chances are slim for China and the U.S. to reach an agreement on trade issues, and trade war worries will be a long-term uncertainty for at least the next two years,"" said Yan Weixiao, an analyst with Founder Securities.
Li Liuyang, senior foreign exchange analyst at China Merchants Bank in Shanghai, said the yuan market should not see huge volatility because the development so far were all expected. “Investors know what's going to happen and it has already been priced in,"" Li said.
""The market will pay attention to any follow up, whether Trump escalates further, or anything unexpected happens.""Gao Qi, FX strategist at Scotiabank, said in a note on Friday. Qi added that he expected the Chinese authorities to step in to prevent the yuan from sharply depreciating, if need be.
""We see a strong resistance of 6.70 for now and the 6.90 level seems China's bottom line for the yuan exchange rate. The yuan will certainly face intensifying depreciation pressure again going forward if China fails to de-escalate trade tensions with the U.S.,"" he wrote.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against at basket of six major currencies, was down 0.02% at 94.11 on Friday after slipping to 94.177, its lowest since June 26, the previous day.

808,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2018 11:30PM ET</span>","Trade war risk, rising oil costs seen keeping India's rupee near record low: Reuters poll","By Shrutee Sarkar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global trade tensions and rising oil prices are expected to weaken India's rupee over the next year, a Reuters poll has found, dragging the currency closer to the record low hit last week against the dollar. 
While economic growth has picked up and India has retained its spot as the fastest growing major economy this year, the rupee  hit an all-time low of 69.09 per dollar last week and is the worst-performing currency in Asia this year.
The rupee, already down more than 7 percent this year, has been pressured by a sell-off in emerging markets driven by the daily escalation in global trade tensions and on worries of a widening current account deficit from the rising price of oil, India's biggest import item.
In the poll of 45 strategists taken July 2-5, the rupee was forecast to weaken to 68.90 per dollar by June 2019, slightly down from Wednesday's close of 68.69. Just last month, the rupee was expected to have strengthened in a year's time.
""We are pretty bearish (on the rupee) at this moment, given all the circumstances combined. Not only high oil prices but also the trade war that has been taking off,"" said Hugo Erken, senior economist at Rabobank.
""So, although India has a large internal market, and I still think the Indian recovery will last, the external pressure is really building at the moment. This is not good for the Indian currency.""
What has changed over the past month is that the prospect of a global trade war has increased and oil prices have risen sharply. U.S. crude futures are up 13 percent since June 1 and were trading near a 3-1/2-year high on Wednesday.
""India is obviously one of those countries with higher exposure to commodities, especially oil imports, dragging the current account to a deeper stretch going forward and this is basically negative for INR,"" said Prakash Sakpal, economist at ING, who has the most pessimistic 12-month call of 72.80.
India's finances will also be hit by the increase to the government-mandated price for summer-sown crops to the highest since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014 as he looks to woo millions of poor farmers ahead of a general election next year.
While that is likely to keep foreign investors wary, Asian currencies and foreign exchange markets will more likely be driven by how the current trade dynamics play out after the July 6 deadline passes for the United States to impose tariffs on some of the Chinese goods it imports.
A separate poll on China's yuan [CNY/POLL] showed it will have failed to reverse June's losses against the dollar even a year from now.
On the rupee, though, not all respondents were bearish. 
While more than a quarter of 46 analysts who had a 12-month view forecast the Indian currency to weaken to the crucial 70 mark or beyond to the dollar, more than 45 percent of respondents predicted the currency would appreciate. The remainder expect the rupee to stay around current levels. 
Several strategists said the expected policy tightening by the Reserve Bank of India would help the rupee.
""The reason we think that it (the rupee) will strengthen, is our forecast for domestic monetary policy...there will be a couple of more rate hikes this year, which is slightly more than expected and that should provide some support to the currency,"" said Shilan Shah, senior India economist at Capital Economics.

""But also, we are forecasting a fall in oil prices over the remainder of this year. If that proves to be the case, then that should lead to some strength in the rupee.""

LONDON (Reuters) - China's yuan will have failed to reverse June's losses against the U.S. dollar even in a year from now, according to a Reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists that was conducted before the U.S. was due to impose steep tariffs on Chinese exports.
The currency  has been volatile in the run-up to the U.S. levying tariffs on Chinese goods. It had its worst month on record in June, losing about 3.3 percent of its value against the greenback, and the slide continued into July.
At the start of the week, the yuan, which is closely managed by the Chinese authorities, fell as far as 6.72 per dollar, weaker than the most pessimistic one-month forecast of 6.60 in the last monthly Reuters poll.
""Risks for a softer yuan have increased recently given the rising threat of larger tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on China,"" said Edoardo Campanella at UniCredit.
However, the yuan rebounded on Tuesday after People's Bank of China Governor Yi Gang said the central bank would seek to keep the yuan at a stable and reasonable level. It continued to ride the updraft on Wednesday but struggled on Thursday.
The yuan was trading around 6.64 per dollar on Thursday and will be around the same level in a month. At year-end, the yuan will have strengthened to 6.57 and then go stronger to 6.50 in a year, the poll of over 60 strategists taken this week showed.
Those median forecasts were weaker than in a June poll and the most pessimistic 12-month forecast moved from 6.80 to 7.20 per dollar.
China has previously intervened in currency markets to weaken the yuan, triggering accusations that Beijing was trying to gain an unfair competitive advantage for its exporters - charges revived by U.S. President Donald Trump in recent years.
The U.S. president has said tariffs would make the U.S. stronger and levies on $34 billion worth of Chinese exports will kick in later on Friday. Beijing has said it would retaliate with tariffs on U.S. products.
But Trump has threatened to escalate the trade conflict with tariffs on as much as $400 billion in Chinese goods if Beijing does retaliate.
""A very tricky period lies ahead for China. Growth is under pressure; exports are under pressure; stocks are under pressure; and the currency is under pressure,"" said Michael Every at Rabobank. ""Warning shots all round, in fact.""

810,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2018 10:20PM ET</span>","Pound to rally after UK leaves EU, say FX strategists: Reuters poll","By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling won't move much in the run-up to Britain's departure from the European Union in March next year but will gain ground on the U.S. dollar afterwards, a Reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists predicted.
As foreseen in numerous Reuters polls, the pound  sank after the surprise June 2016 referendum result when Britons voted to part ways with the EU. 
But three-quarters of over 50 respondents to an extra question said sterling is unlikely to set a new post-Brexit vote low before the country leaves the political and economic bloc it has been a member of for more than four decades in March 2019.
The Bank of England will raise interest rates to 0.75 percent in August, according to a Reuters poll last month that also gave only a median 20 percent chance of a hard Brexit - an outcome that would be negative for sterling. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve has already raised rates seven times from near-zero over the past few years to 1.75-2.00 percent and is expected to raise them twice more this year and several more next year. 
""While a rate hike will help provide some support for the pound, the period of Brexit uncertainty (even assuming some progress in July) is likely to persist going forward, which is likely to limit the extent of sterling appreciation in 2018,"" noted analysts at MUFG.
""Still, we continue to expect a deal to be reached this side of Christmas which will see a more notable period of GBP appreciation.""
Since the referendum result, the pound has swung wildly. It reached a post-referendum high above $1.43 in April before hopes of a May rate hike from the BoE were dashed. On Thursday, cable was trading around $1.32. 
While there may be volatility in between, the median forecast in the wider poll of around 70 strategists taken this week was for it to have moved little from there in three and six months.
In a year from now a pound will be worth more, $1.39. While that is just a touch weaker than the $1.41 predicted in June it is well below a recent high above $1.43, and nearly 10 cents below where it was just before the referendum result over two years ago. 
The latest predictions for sterling are part of broader expectations in the wider Reuters poll for the U.S. dollar to weaken after a run-up earlier this year. [EUR/POLL]
Against the euro, the pound will barely move, the poll predicted. On Thursday a euro (EURGBP=) was worth 88.2 pence and in a year's time it will get you 88.0p.
Later on Friday, British Prime Minister Theresa May will make a last-ditch attempt to unite her divided government on what kind of relationship with the EU it wants.
May is under increasing pressure from EU officials, companies and some lawmakers to move forward with negotiations to leave the EU, a departure that will mark Britain's biggest trading and foreign policy shift in almost half a century.

811,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2018 08:20PM ET</span>",Dollar's allure to last a little longer but fade next year: Reuters poll,"By Hari Kishan and Rahul Karunakar
(Reuters) - The U.S. dollar's recent resurgence will last another three months, and possibly up to six, but its dominance will fade next year, a Reuters poll of currency strategists showed. 
With a brightening economic backdrop outside the United States and an expected huge U.S. budget gap from aggressive tax cuts passed by Congress, Reuters foreign exchange polls had until April been forecasting the dollar to underperform in 2018.
But the greenback, which lost over 10 percent in 2017, has gained about 3 percent so far this year as major economies lost momentum. With risks of a global trade war increasing daily, investors have taken shelter in U.S. assets.
Currency speculators increased bullish bets on the dollar to the largest since mid-May last year at the end of June, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
That run up in the dollar is predicted to continue this year as the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to deliver interest rate hikes steadily through this year and next, according to the poll of over 70 strategists taken June 2-5.
""With (U.S. President Donald) Trump and the Fed forging ahead with their domestic agendas, expect the dollar to stay supported and the risk environment to stay fragile,"" noted Chris Turner, global head of strategy at ING.
Just last month, nearly 60 percent, or 35 of 60 analysts said the dollar's recent dominance would only last about three months, including 10 respondents who expected it to end within a month.
While about 60 percent of a larger sample of nearly 70 analysts in the latest poll still expect the dollar's recent rally to last only up to three months, there were more respondents this month than last who said the momentum will go on for another six months.
""The period of synchronized global growth underway for the past year looks to be giving way to a period of more U.S.-biased global growth. With this shift, we want to avoid being underweight U.S. dollars,"" noted Mike Ryan, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS.
With the U.S. economy sprinting ahead, the Fed made its tone slightly more hawkish at its recent meeting even as the European Central Bank made clear interest rates will not rise in the euro zone until late next year.
That widening policy gap between the Fed and other major central banks is expected to be one of the main drivers of dollar strength going forward, according to a majority of analysts who answered a separate question.
""Because of the Fed's position to stand out as the most hawkish bank within the G10, the dollar is getting that bit of extra support over and above other G10 currencies,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank.
Rising concerns about a trade war keeping the dollar well-bid as a safety bet for now, and better-than-expected U.S. economic performance were also cited as key supports for the currency.
But safe-haven bets are likely to trigger an inversion in U.S. Treasury yields within the next year or two, signaling more trouble ahead. [US/INT]
""If the global trade wars intensify and there is a spike in global risk aversion, the USD could benefit at the expense of the emerging market and high-beta currencies, but the FX majors could even outperform the USD if the conflict between China and the U.S. intensifies,"" BBVA (MC:BBVA) strategist Roberto Cobo Garcia said.
In line with that, the greenback was forecast to lose its allure beyond 2018 and instead expectations of other central banks' policy paths, which are likely to become clearer, would dictate currency moves more next year.
That was evident in predictions for the euro.
The euro (EUR=), which has fallen out of favor in recent months, is down close to 3 percent this year, the currency's worst half-yearly performance since 2015.
The single currency is forecast to recoup much of those loses against the dollar by the end of this year, however, and be up over 4 percent in 12 months.
The euro was forecast at $1.19 in six months, almost a 2 percent gain from around $1.17 it was trading at on Thursday. It was forecast to rise to $1.22 in a year.
Sterling, which has taken a pounding in recent weeks, will move little in the run up to Britain's departure from the European Union next year and then gain ground on the U.S. dollar post-Brexit. [GBP/POLL]

Investors remained cautious ahead of Friday’s deadline for the U.S. to impose a 25% tariff on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports, which Beijing has vowed to match with a levy on U.S. products.
China's commerce ministry warned Thursday that the U.S. is ""opening fire"" on the world with its threatened tariffs, and reiterated that it will respond the instant U.S. measures go into effect.

The euro rose to near three-week highs, with EUR/USD rising 0.29% to 1.1691.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro climbed half a percent to near three-week highs on Thursday following strong German data, though gains were capped before the release of Fed minutes later in the day.
German industrial orders bounced back in May with a stronger-than-expected jump after four consecutive monthly drops, as demand from domestic customers and the rest of the euro zone picked up.
Media reports that the European Central Bank may be preparing to raise interest rates by next September or October also helped the euro, though thin volumes were a factor, with U.S. markets shut overnight for Independence Day.
""The euro is getting a bit of a lift on the German data though the trade concerns will continue to dominate markets with the Fed minutes being the key data point,"" said Kenneth Broux, a currency strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in London.
In early London trading, the single currency rallied to a high of $1.1711, just shy of a three-week peak of $1.1722.
But with a deadline for Washington to impose tariffs on Chinese imports also due, markets remained rangebound. 
The offshore yuan  was broadly steady at 6.6466 per dollar, some distance from Tuesday's 11-month low of 6.7344, following reassuring remarks from Yi Gang, governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC).
""Chinese authorities have been clear they don't want to use the weaker yuan as a major foreign exchange trade policy...

However, Chinese Ministry of Finance said in a statement on Wednesday that China would “never fire the first shot”, and that the country would not implement tariffs ahead of the U.S., despite recent reports suggested that Beijing would begin imposing tariffs hours ahead of the U.S. due to the time zone difference.

817,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 05, 2018 12:31AM ET</span>",Want to Win the Trade War? Long the Dollar,"(Bloomberg) -- Trade wars are good, and easy to win -- that’s a Donald Trump assertion which is giving succor to dollar bulls.
They see the greenback as a better haven than gold should the tariff tit-for-tat intensify. Four months after the U.S. president shocked equity markets with his vision of higher duties on imports to America, investors are discovering catalysts that should help the nation’s currency withstand trade turbulence better than gold.
“The dollar has become the main destination for safe-haven investors,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S, said by email from Copenhagen. “Geopolitical risk is on the rise, bonds and stocks have sold off and yet gold continues to drift lower.”
The prospect that import tariffs will reduce the biggest economy’s current-account deficit at a time when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates has created a rare opportunity. The dollar can be used both as a haven and in carry trades, according to Andreas Steno Larsen, a global currency strategist at Nordea Bank AB in Copenhagen.
The currency’s hold over gold is strengthened by the fact the metal is usually priced in dollars -- they’re inversely correlated.
Bad Half
With bullion last week posting its worst first-half performance in five years, investors are recalculating how they weight traditional assets. The push is coming from a confluence of events, from Trump’s antagonistic stance toward America’s trading partners, to the fact that the Fed is winding down quantitative easing earlier than its counterparts in Japan or Europe.
The global stocks benchmark MSCI All Country World Index just notched its first back-to-back quarterly decline since 2015, and emerging-market equities posted the first drop in six quarters. Meanwhile the dollar is outperforming most major currencies. As the world’s most liquid bond market offers higher yields, the appeal dwindles for holding an asset bereft of an income stream such as gold.
Meanwhile, the currency strengthened its grip over gold prices, overshadowing other drivers including falling physical demand in India, industrial-demand expectations and dwindling investment flows in exchange-traded funds. About half of gold’s fluctuation since January could be explained by movements in the greenback, regression analysis shows. That’s a stronger bond than in any year in the past decade.
At the same time, the 120-day correlation between the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which was up 1.7 percent this year through July 3, and the S&P 500 turned negative in February. A stronger-than-noise reading of negative 0.3 meant the benchmark indexes moved in opposite directions more than not. A rallying dollar may itself be a headwind to stocks.
A “significant” driver of the dollar’s gains this year has been reduced risk appetite, spurring a tide of capital to dollar assets as emerging markets seize up, according to Jane Foley, head of currency strategy at Rabobank. That said, “the sheer liquidity associated with the dollar means that for some investors it will always be a safe haven,” she wrote in a recent note.

818,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 04, 2018 06:11PM ET</span>",Southeast Asia Diverges on Rate Policy as Currency Rout Deepens,"(Bloomberg) -- Southeast Asia’s central bankers are taking diverging policy stances even as their economies get slammed by the same headwinds.
Dollar strength, higher oil prices, and global monetary policy tightening are adding pressure on key emerging markets to protect their currencies and curb outflows. Amid all that volatility, central banks still have their inflation targets to consider. While the pickup in crude costs has seen policy makers across Southeast Asia add fuel subsidies to their inflation-fighting toolbox, their interest-rate policy is much less uniform.
The Philippines and Indonesia are finding more pressing needs to tighten policy for different reasons, while Thailand and Malaysia stick with a more patient stance. Here’s how inflation is factoring into monetary policy approaches across Southeast Asia:
Philippines
The inflation hot streak shows no signs of abating in the Philippines, with economists seeing a fifth straight increase on the cards for the June report due Thursday. Price growth probably sped up to 4.8 percent last month from 4.6 percent, setting a fresh record in five years of data and giving more credence to those who worry the economy could be overheating amid strong growth.
The peso is among the weakest currencies in Asia this year, which gives more reason for officials to consider tightening as emerging markets aim to stem outflows. The central bank hiked its overnight reverse repurchase rate by 25 basis points each in May and June, with Governor Nestor Espenilla keeping the door open for more increases.
Indonesia
Bank Indonesia’s surprise move last week to raise the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points -- on top of two hikes in May -- shows how determined officials are to stabilize the rupiah amid investment outflows.
A third straight easing in inflation in June, as reported Monday, should give officials some reassurance, but with the currency still under pressure, price growth isn’t the primary target of central bankers right now.
Thailand
Thai inflation unexpectedly eased a bit in June from a year earlier, against economists’ projections for a fourth straight increase, data showed Monday.
Even so, bets are mounting the Bank of Thailand is moving closer to tightening monetary policy. Brent crude prices are hovering near $80 a barrel, and the baht is down 1.6 percent against the dollar this year. Policy makers discussed conditions and appropriate timing for policy normalization at their meeting on June 20, when the benchmark rate was left near a record low of 1.5 percent.
Economists at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. see a 25 basis-point rate hike as early as November.
Malaysia
Inflation has been less of a focus in Malaysia, where a political transition is fueling policy uncertainty, including at the central bank following the sudden resignation of the governor.
As a net energy exporter, higher oil prices have a more benign effect on inflation in Malaysia. The scrapping of a 6 percent goods-and-services tax should also keep price growth tame, at least until the planned introduction of a sales tax later this year.
After an early interest-rate hike in January, inflation has steadily eased, lending little urgency to tighten monetary policy. Just four of 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg in mid-May saw another increase in the benchmark interest rate by year-end."

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar steadied against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday while holding near its strongest level in nearly three weeks, as oil prices rose and investors braced for a potential interest rate hike next week from the Bank of Canada.
At 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT), the Canadian dollar  was trading nearly unchanged at C$1.3142 to the greenback, or 76.09 U.S. cents. 
The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, was driven higher by a threat to supply from an Iranian commander and a drop in U.S. crude inventories for a second week in a row.
U.S. crude oil futures (CLc1) rose 0.3 percent to $74.33 a barrel.
""Right now we have many problems on the oil supply side ... and we may see high prices for a few more months,"" said Hendrix Vachon, senior economist at Desjardins.
The higher price of oil and an expectation in the market that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates next week have boosted the loonie, Vachon said.
Money markets see about a 70 percent chance of a rate increase at the July 11 announcement.
Expectations have been raised by hawkish comments last week by Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz and recent domestic data that showed business optimism and stronger-than-expected growth in Canada's economy.
Independence Day celebrations in the United States discouraged traders on Wednesday from taking big positions in major currencies, not least until there is some clarity about where the escalating U.S.-China trade tensions are heading. Washington is due to impose tariffs on Chinese imports at the end of the week.
Canada has its own trade dispute with the United States and is also contending with slow-moving talks to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Also, reduced Canadian oil supplies after a production problem at the Syncrude oil sands facility in Alberta could hurt the country's economic growth in the third quarter.
Canadian government bond prices were lower across the yield curve, with the two-year (CA2YT=RR) down 2.5 Canadian cents to yield 1.909 percent and the 10-year (CA10YT=RR) falling 17 Canadian cents to yield 2.158 percent.
On Tuesday, the 10-year yield touched its highest intraday level in more than two weeks, at 2.204 percent.

Canada's employment report for June and trade data for May are due out on Friday.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's yuan rose sharply against the dollar on Wednesday, a day after the central bank assured markets it would keep the currency stable amid heightened worries about trade frictions, although stocks remained under pressure.
Chinese currency and equity markets have been volatile ahead of July 6, when U.S. tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods are set to kick in. Beijing has said it would retaliate with tariffs on U.S. products.
The yuan  had its worst month on record in June, losing about 3.3 percent of its value against the greenback, and the slide continued on Monday, the first trading day of July.
On Tuesday, though, it rebounded after the remarks from People's Bank of China Governor Yi Gang and continued to ride the updraft on Wednesday, putting the yuan on track for its first two-day winning streak since the middle of June and best day since late March.
At 0630 GMT (2.30 a.m. ET), it was trading at 6.6009 yuan per dollar, about 0.65 percent stronger than the late night close on Tuesday.
""Thankfully for regional risk, the PBOC engaged the yuan airbrake yesterday afternoon and at least for the time being, with the help of Chinese state-owned banks who were seen selling dollars to prop up the Chinese currency, is restoring a sense of calm in regional markets,"" OANDA wrote in a note.
A trader at a Chinese bank said the PBOC's signal was clear, but the market would closely watch and react to developments ahead of July 6.
""In the short term, the yuan will continue consolidating at the current level, while sharp, one-way falling might have come to an end,"" the trader said.
Key Chinese equity indexes were less enthusiastic, starting the day flip-flopping around Tuesday's closing prices before sliding into negative territory and staying there.
The benchmark CSI300 Index (CSI300) was down 1.3 percent by 0637 GMT, and the Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) was off 1 percent.
A person with knowledge of the plan told Reuters that Chinese tariffs on $34 billion of U.S. goods would take effect from midnight Beijing time on July 6 in response to the U.S. move.
In flagging its first move, Washington said it would implement its tariffs on July 6, but the 12-hour time difference technically puts Beijing ahead in imposing its reciprocal measures.
Also muddying trade relations between the world's two largest economies was a Chinese court ruling that temporarily barred U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology Inc (O:MU) from selling some of its main products in the world's biggest memory chip market. Separately, the central bank of Singapore, whose economy is heavily reliant on global trade, warned risks to the global growth outlook have significantly increased due to the intensifying trade row between Washington and Beijing.
""Investors are quite pessimistic at this point, and the downward correction for traditional blue-chips, represented by the heavyweight 'nifty 50' firms, is not over yet,"" said Wang Mingli, an analyst with Guoyuan Securities.
An index tracking the 50 most representative blue-chips in Shanghai (SSE50), dubbed China’s ""nifty 50"", slid around 1 percent to a near 14-month low.
However, Wang saw investment value in some growth and tech firms, saying the authorities were attaching more importance to the country's tech sector amid a bitter trade spat with the United States.

In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index (HSI) was down more than 1.3 percent, while an index that tracks mainland companies (HSCE) had fallen about 1.7 percent.

Reports that the People’s Bank of China assured markets the central bank would keep the currency stable were cited as supporting the yuan.
Yi Gang, governor of the PBOC, said in a statement on Tuesday that the central bank would closely monitor fluctuation in the forex market and would take action to keep the yuan at a stable and reasonable level.

Many investors fear that the proposed plan to impose tariffs on more Chinese goods would further dampen global growth. Beijing has earlier said that it would match with tariffs on U.S. products, raising the risk of a full-blown trade war.

824,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 09:20PM ET</span>",China's Yuan Shakeout Fails to Trigger Panic Among Traders,"(Bloomberg) -- The last time China’s currency sank as quickly as it has in recent weeks, panic ensued: traders rushed to hedge their yuan positions or speculate on further declines, global markets plunged, and policy makers in Beijing responded with heavy-handed intervention.
Now -- almost three years after China’s shock 2015 devaluation -- the response to yuan weakness is proving decidedly more subdued. While gauges of trader angst have ticked up, they’re a far cry from levels reached in 2015 and early 2016.
“I don’t see panic,” said Ryan Lam, the head of research at Shanghai Commercial Bank.
That could change, of course, if China’s economy shows further signs of deterioration amid the trade fight with the U.S. But for now, traders appear to have faith that the yuan’s slump won’t spiral out of control. That sentiment was underscored on Tuesday as the currency rebounded from an 11-month low, buoyed by reassurances from Chinese central bankers that they will keep their nation’s currency stable and not deploy it as a weapon in the trade conflict with the U.S.
Below are six charts showing how key yuan indicators have evolved since the devaluation rocked assets around the world:
The offshore yuan’s three-month risk reversal -- a gauge of traders’ willingness to bet against the yuan in the options market -- is still well below levels reached in 2015 and 2016. While yuan options volume has jumped, bearish positioning has yet to reach extremes.
The yuan’s one-month implied volatility shows traders are pricing in the prospect of larger swings in the currency, but the metric has been higher than current levels several times over the past few years.
Action in the forwards market is markedly different than in the wake of the 2015 devaluation, with 12-month forward points declining to multi-year lows. That suggests there’s been no rush to finance bearish bets.
Funding costs in the offshore yuan market remain low, suggesting the PBOC hasn’t tried to tighten cash supply this time around, a form of intervention. Mopping up liquidity is one way to burn yuan bears by making it expensive to short the currency.
The offshore yuan has been trading basically in line with the onshore exchange rate, reflecting limited bearish bets in the overseas market. The gap was more than six times larger at the start of 2016.
Foreign investors increased their holdings of onshore Chinese bonds for a record 16 straight months in June. Expectations that they’ll keep buying has helped bolster confidence in the yuan, according to Christy Tan, head of markets strategy at National Australia Bank in Singapore. Foreign purchases briefly declined after the yuan devaluation three years ago.

The win by longtime political outsider Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Dec. 1, was expected by markets, but his margin of victory was wider than projected and it appears his coalition will have a majority in Congress.
Despite uncertainty about the shape of economic policy in his administration, foreign investors are attracted to the peso because of high Mexican interest rates, said Christian Lawrence, a market strategist at Rabobank. 
Mexico's benchmark rate is at 7.75 percent compared to 6.50 percent in Brazil. 
""I have been surprised by the complacency around the win by Lopez Obrador, but there is a mindset of giving him the benefit of the doubt,"" Lawrence said. 
Lopez Obrador and his team have strived to mollify the concerns of investors, telling them he will maintain fiscal discipline and respect private investment.
Carlos Urzua, Lopez Obrador's pick to be his finance minister, told Reuters on Monday that Lopez Obrador supports ideas such as creating a fiscal committee for prudent economic management and cost cutting at state-owned oil firm Pemex.
Lopez Obrador has said he will fund increased social spending on pensions for the elderly and scholarships for youths by eliminating waste and fighting corruption. But analysts doubt he will be able to quickly achieve enough savings with his anti-corruption plan.
Lawrence said that concerns about an increase in government spending could come back to hit the peso later this year when Lopez Obrador presents his first budget in December.
On Monday, an advisor to Lopez Obrador told Reuters the election win would jumpstart talks between Mexico, the United States and Canada to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

Jesus Seade, Lopez Obrador's chief negotiator for NAFTA, said the talks to revamp the 24-year-old pact had been hindered by uncertainty over the outcome of the Mexican election, and would pick up following Lopez Obrador's decisive win. He stressed an agreement was possible before the next government takes power in December.

830,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 02, 2018 06:40PM ET</span>",Yuan Chases Loonie's Share as Bank of Russia Adds Chinese Assets,"(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s central bank almost tripled the yuan’s share in its foreign-exchange and gold assets, nearly matching the allocation for the Canadian dollar and leaving a fifth of its holdings invested in bullion and the Chinese currency.
The yuan’s proportion jumped to 2.8 percent in the last three months of 2017 from 1 percent in the third quarter, according to a report published on Monday by the Bank of Russia, which discloses the data with a half-year lag. That’s just short of the 3.1 percent for the Canadian dollar, or loonie as it’s known. The shares allocated to the U.S. dollar and the euro fell, while gold’s ratio exceeded 17 percent.
“The rise in the share of yuan assets, albeit still relatively small, reflects Russia’s intentions to diversify away from major currencies,” said Piotr Matys, an emerging-markets currency strategist at Rabobank in London. But “it will not be easy for Russia to significantly reduce the share of the dollar in its reserves given that the greenback is still one of the most liquid currencies.”
With the buying spree of almost $12 billion in the second half of last year, the push into yuan by Russia’s central bank moved at a much faster clip than a more incremental increase globally. The Chinese currency’s share reached only 1.4 percent of worldwide reserves in the first quarter, from 1.2 percent in the previous three months, according to the International Monetary Fund.
From the Bundesbank to the central bank of Kazakhstan, the yuan’s international status has grown since its acceptance in 2016 to the IMF’s reference basket of currencies, or Special Drawing Rights. But while the renminbi -- the official name of China’s currency -- first became part of the Bank of Russia’s holdings in 2015, its share remained negligible before last year.
Four years ago, the central banks of Russia and China agreed to a currency-swap deal to facilitate trade and investment between the two countries. Soon after, Russia’s central bank first invested 14.5 billion rubles ($228 million) in Chinese bonds.
While Russian policy makers haven’t explained their rationale for buying yuan, they highlighted the successes of the Chinese economy last year, accompanied by new rules that contributed to the renminbi’s appreciation against the U.S. dollar. Meanwhile, tighter control over the banking industry as well as higher short-term interest rates on providing liquidity led to higher yields on Chinese sovereign bonds, the Bank of Russia said.
The outlook has recently turned for the worse. The managed currency has slumped over 3 percent since mid-June -- among the worst performers in emerging markets -- as concern over a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy collided with anxiety over the trade war with the U.S.
The bulk of the Bank of Russia’s assets, however, is still in the U.S. dollar, despite its proportion shrinking to 45.8 percent in the fourth quarter from 46.5 percent in the previous three months. The euro’s share reached 21.7 percent from 24.1 percent, according to the report.
The decision to reduce the euro’s share in favor of the U.S. dollar resulted from the growing difference in returns on American and European assets, the Bank of Russia said, pointing to the divergence of monetary policies between the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. President Vladimir Putin has said that a “break” from the dollar is necessary for Russia’s “economic sovereignty” amid sanctions, vowing that his country will continue to diversify its reserves.

Policy makers also increased interest rates on local central bank notes known as Lebacs that come due over the next few months to pay yields as high as 52 percent.
The steps are part of new central bank chief Luis Caputo’s efforts to stem the selloff in the peso, which has tumbled 34 percent this year for the worst performance in emerging markets. President Mauricio Macri is trying to boost confidence after obtaining a record $50 billion credit line from the International Monetary Fund in the wake of the currency rout.
The peso gained 1.9 percent Monday to 28.3 per dollar for the biggest advance since May 15.
The government has no plans to add capital controls, Treasury Minister Nicolas Dujovne, Finance Secretary Santiago Bausili and Economic Policy Secretary Guido Sandleris told investors during a conference call meant to assuage concerns.
They added that Argentina will borrow mostly in the domestic market in 2018 and 2019. The government will only raise funds abroad in 2019 to pay for $3 billion of maturing debt.
""The most important objective is to regain the confidence of the markets to lower the cost of financing,"" Dujovne said during the call. ""That’s our No. 1 objective.""
Stocks didn’t fare as well as the peso, with the benchmark Merval equity index reaching the lowest since September."

Ahead of a meeting of UK ministers later this week a report said officials had drafted a new option for how to handle customs with the European Union.
""I am very clear that we should be doing everything that we can to ensure that at the end of December 2020 we are able to see our future customs relationship in place such that that backstop is not necessary,"" she told Parliament.

May also reiterated that keeping Britain in the European Economic Area after Brexit was not an option being considered by the government.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.63% to 94.82.
ISM manufacturing data  for June showed an uptick to a reading of 60.2 from 58.7, beating expectations for a reading of 58.4. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion, while a reading below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the U.S. economy.
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Monday, meanwhile, showed construction spending increased 0.4% in May. That was slower than the 0.5% growth economists had forecast.
The upcoming $34 billion of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imported goods slated for July 6 drew support for the greenback as traders bet that the U.S. would fare better in a potential trade war than its trade partners as domestic growth remains strong.
""Unless worries of a full blown trade war evaporate in the second half of 2018, investors are likely to continue buying safe-haven currencies, including the dollar, Japanese yen and Swiss franc,"" said Rabobank.
USD/JPY fell 0.05%, while USD/CHF rose 0.41% to 0.9947.

Mexico’s peso reversed early gains to weaken 1.1 percent against the dollar by 3:11 p.m. in London after 64-year-old leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s landslide election victory, according to the earliest figures announced by officials. The zloty, rand, lira and yuan also fell as the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.6 percent.
Attention will then turn to U.S. jobs data and the Federal Reserve minutes on Thursday, as well as unemployment data on Friday as investors gauge whether trade friction has impacted the nation’s economic outlook. A U.S. deadline for $34 billion in tariffs on China is also due Friday. The Asian country has pledged to retaliate if President Donald Trump follows through.
“Things have got to get worse before they get better -- that’s the disturbing situation,” Claudio Piron, co-head of Asian currency and rates strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in Singapore, told Bloomberg TV’s Haidi Lun and Rishaad Salamat.
This week will be highly critical with election results in Mexico “and how that will have a bearing on Nafta,” Piron said. The deadline for tariffs is “going to be key” in determining how much worse the situation will get “before things can possibly get better,” he said.
The war of words between the world’s biggest economies over commerce added fuel to a sell-off sparked by a rising dollar and hawkish central banks in developed economies. It sent a Bloomberg currency index that measures carry-trade returns from eight emerging markets, funded by short positions in the dollar, tumbling the most on a quarterly basis since 2011.
Emerging-market stocks and currencies dropped the most since 2015 in the three months through June, and a Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) index of local-currency bonds posted its first quarterly retreat since 2016. Both the equity and currency gauges extended their declines on Monday, with the latter heading for its lowest since August.
“The practical impact of the trade wars is small thus far and is beneficial to many emerging-market credits, for example oil and metals companies, but the bearish impact on sentiment and possibility of a downward spiral overwhelms this,” said Richard Segal, a senior analyst at Manulife Asset Management Ltd. in London.
“It’s advisable to remain cautious for a while, and better buying opportunities will appear later in the summer,” he said.

835,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 02, 2018 03:58AM ET</span>","Forex - Euro Lower as Trade Fears, German Uncertainty Weigh","Investing.com - The euro was lower on Monday as fears over the prospect of a global trade war and fresh political uncertainty in Germany pressured the single currency, while the dollar pared back overnight gains against the safe haven yen.
EUR/USD was down 0.47% to 1.1628 by 03:56 AM ET (07:56 AM GMT).
The euro came under pressure after Germany's interior minister offered to resign amid an escalating row over immigration policy, throwing into doubt the future of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition government.
The euro had risen on Friday after European Union leaders reached a deal on migration, easing pressure on Merkel.
The single currency was also pressured lower after U.S. President Donald Trump ratcheted up trade tensions with the EU, claiming overnight that it treated the U.S. very badly and was “possibly as bad as China, just smaller”.
The comments raised the prospect that the U.S. could impose further tariffs on EU imports, possibly on auto imports.
The EU has threatened to retaliate with tariffs on up to $300 billion of U.S. products if the U.S. does penalize EU automakers.
The euro was weaker against the yen and the Swiss franc, with EUR/JPY down 0.48% to 128.77 and EUR/CHF shedding 0.33% to trade at 1.1540.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.39% to 94.60, boosted by the weaker euro.
The dollar pared back gains against the yen, with USD/JPY last at 110.74, after hitting a six week high of 111.06 overnight.
Demand for the dollar continued to be underpinned by the relative strength of the U.S. economy and the prospects of additional rate hikes by the Federal Reserve this year.
The pound was lower, with GBP/USD down 0.42% at 1.3155.
The trade sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars were lower, with AUD/USD down 0.54% to 0.7368, re-approaching the one-and-a-half year low of 0.7322 reached last Wednesday.
NZD/USD was down 0.28% to an almost one-year low of 0.6749."
836,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2018 02:37AM ET</span>",Mexico peso wobbles after leftist Lopez Obrador's big win,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's peso whipsawed after leftist candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador won Mexico's presidential election on Sunday with a big margin that may herald a congressional majority.
The peso  gained more than 1 percent when the first exit polls tipped a Lopez Obrador victory.
But the currency erased those gains to weaken as much as 0.8 percent after an official quick count by electoral authorities showed he took over 53 percent of the vote. The currency settled back to trade down only slightly after he offered a moderate victory speech. 
His margin of victory was at the upper end of polls and suggests his leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party may clinch majorities in Congress, which could allow him to make bigger economic changes.
""MORENA will likely get a majority in Congress,"" said Benito Berber, an analyst at Nomura. ""Market sentiment will suffer, but not too much.""
In a victory speech at a downtown hotel, Lopez Obrador struck a conciliatory tone, saying he would preserve fiscal discipline and central bank independence.
But he also said he would review oil contracts awarded to major oil companies to ensure there had been no corruption. Later, speaking before tens of thousands in the historic city center he said he would double pensions for the elderly and establish a government ""by the people"".
Polls had tipped a wide victory for Lopez Obrador, who many investors are expecting will govern from the center.
The peso hit a one-month high on Friday before pulling back and Mexico's benchmark stock index (MXX) closed at a more than eight-week high while options trading pointed to a possible slump this week.
A solid congressional majority would give Lopez Obrador the power to raise spending without brokering deals with other parties. Lopez Obrador has insisted he will maintain a fiscal surplus and fund more social spending by fighting corruption. 
Analysts said it would take until Monday or Tuesday to have a clearer idea how congressional races panned out.
Marco Oviedo, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), thought the peso would hold around current levels, but that the market would be watching Lopez Obrador for further signs of where he will take policy. 
Investors will also be waiting to see how Lopez Obrador will engage the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and what tack he will take on deadlocked talks to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), analysts said. 

""The market will concentrate on his plans: the 2019 budget, NAFTA, his communications with Trump, if he is orthodox and pragmatic,"" Oviedo said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The euro slipped back in Asian trade on Monday after German Chancellor Angela Merkel was dealt a fresh blow when her interior minister offered to quit in an escalating row over migration policy.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who has called for tougher border controls, said he was ready to step down as minister and as chair of his Christian Social Union (CSU), junior coalition partner in Merkel's government. 
While the euro initially rose to as high as $1.1698 in a knee-jerk reaction to the news, it quickly lost steam as Seehofer's departure would be seen as making Merkel's future even more uncertain.
The common currency last stood at $1.1653 (EUR=), down 0.32 percent from late U.S. trade on Friday. Against the safe-haven Swiss franc, it fell 0.15 percent to 1.1557 franc (EURCHF=).
The euro had gained on Friday after European Union leaders hammered out an agreement on migration that investors hoped would ease pressure on Merkel.
The dollar extended its gains against the yen to hit a fresh six-week high of 111.06 yen .
The Japanese currency was unmoved by the Bank of Japan's tankan business sentiment survey, which showed a slight dip in big Japanese manufacturers' sentiment.
The dollar has been supported by the relative strength of the U.S. economy and the prospects of further rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
Data on Friday showed so-called core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred gauge of U.S. inflation, rose 2.0 percent from a year earlier, the biggest gain since April 2012.
That kept alive expectations that the Fed will raise rates at least once and possibly twice by the end of year.
Yet investors are also becoming wary of possible disruptions from the trade disputes triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist ""America First"" policy.
Canada struck back on Friday at the Trump administration over U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs, imposing punitive measures on C$16.6 billion ($12.63 billion) worth of American goods, effective from Sunday.
The United States has also threatened to impose duties on up to $450 billion of Chinese imports, with the first $34 billion portion set to go into effect on July 6.
While economists expect the direct economic damage from those tariffs to be relatively contained, at least for now, many see the reversal of globalisation could have negative repercussions for years to come, lowering companies' longer-term growth expectations.
Fears of a trade war have already knocked Chinese shares to two-year lows, and dented the yuan last week.
The yuan, which posted its biggest monthly fall on record last month, was not much changed at 6.6460 per dollar  in offshore trade, just ahead of Friday's seven-month low of 6.6522 to the dollar.
""The Chinese authorities do not seem to have tried to stem the yuan's fall, which many people take as a message from Beijing that that's one thing they could do against U.S. pressure on trade,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo branch manager of State Street Bank.
The official survey on China's manufacturing sector published on Saturday suggested growth in the sector slowed slightly in June after a better-than-expected performance in May.
Elsewhere, the Mexican peso gained as much as 1.4 percent, in choppy early Asian trade on Monday after exit polls showed Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador - widely known as AMLO - scored a decisive win to secure Mexico's presidency on Sunday.
Lopez Obrador, former Mexico City mayor and anti-establishment leftist, rode a wave of voters' anger at rampant violence and corruption in the country.
Investors are now looking to the results of Congressional elections, where National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), a party that has only existed formally since 2014, could be close to a majority.
The peso last traded at 19.8380 to the dollar , up 0.39 percent on the day and edging near one-month high of 19.5615 touched on Friday.
""I think that given the wide lead AMLO had during the whole campaign, a result favorable to him was already priced in the currency,"" said Tania Escobedo, New York-based Latam FX Strategist at RBC Capital Markets. 

""So far it seems that the process has been calm and without major disruptions. Signs for a smooth transition and a conciliatory tone from the candidates are also, in our view, adding to Mexican peso strength.""

(Reuters) - The U.S. dollar's share of currency reserves reported to the International Monetary Fund fell in first quarter of 2018 to a fresh four-year low, while euro, yuan and sterling's shares of reserves increased, according to the latest data from the International Monetary Fund.
The share of dollar reserves shrank for five consecutive quarters as the greenback weakened in the first three months of 2018 on expectations faster growth outside the United States and bets that other major central banks would consider reducing stimulus. Still the dollar has remained the biggest reserve currency by far. 
However, the dollar strengthened in the second quarter on fears about a global trade war and the European Central Bank signaling it would not raise interest rates until latter half of 2019. 
Global reserves are assets of central banks held in different currencies, mainly used to support their liabilities. Central banks sometimes have used reserves to help support their respective currencies.
Reserves held in U.S. dollars climbed to $6.499 trillion, or 62.48 percent of allocated reserves, in the first quarter. This compared with $6.282 trillion, or 62.72 percent of allocated reserves, in the fourth quarter of 2017. The share of U.S. dollar reserves contracted to its smallest level since reaching 61.24 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, IMF data released late on Friday showed.
Ranked second behind the greenback, the euro's share of global reserves reached 20.39 percent in the fourth quarter, up from 20.15 percent in the fourth quarter. This was its largest share since the final quarter of 2014, but well below the single currency's peak share of reserves at 28 percent in 2009.
China's share of allocated currency reserves increased for a third straight quarter to 1.39 percent. The IMF had reported the yuan's share of central bank holdings for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Sterling's share of currency reserves moved up to 4.68 percent in the first quarter, the biggest since the fourth quarter of 2015, IMF data showed.

The yen's share of currency reserves retreated to 4.81 percent from prior quarter's 4.89 percent, which was its biggest since the fourth quarter of 2002.

The Fed hiked interest rates in June and signaled for the first time that they could lift rates four times this year so market watchers will be focusing on the discussions around the inflation outlook and trade war fears.
On Friday, attention will shift to the U.S. employment report for June for an update on the health of the labor market. The report is expected to show that hiring cooled.
Last month’s jobs report was overshadowed by a tweet from U.S. President Donald Trump that said he was looking forward to the data, so investors will likely keep an eye on the president’s Twitter account ahead of the release of the report.
Alongside the jobs report, markets will watch for updates on the U.S. manufacturing and services sectors.
The dollar fell sharply against the euro on Friday as political uncertainty in Europe eased after European Union leaders reached a deal on migration, easing pressure on German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
EUR/USD rose 1% to 1.1684 late Friday.
The gains in the euro pressured the dollar broadly lower. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.81% at 94.23 late Friday.
Gains in the pound also pressured the dollar. GBP/USD climbed 1.02% to 1.3210 after an upward revision to UK first quarter growth revived hopes for monetary policy tightening in the coming months.
The greenback fell to two-week lows against its Canadian counterpart, with USD/CAD dropping 0.87% to 1.3133 in late trade.
The gains in the loonie came after data showing an unexpected uptick in Canadian economic growth in April potentially set stage for a Bank of Canada rate hike as soon as this month.
Despite Friday’s losses, the dollar index finished the second quarter with gains of 5.6% on the back of the divergence in monetary policy between the Fed and other central banks.

The latest loan highlights Islamabad's growing dependence on Chinese loans to buffer its foreign currency reserves, which plunged to $9.66 billion last week from $16.4 billion in May 2017.
The lending is the outcome of negotiations for loans worth $1-$2 billion that was first reported by Reuters in late May, the two sources told Reuters.
""Yes, it is with us,"" said one finance ministry source, in reference to the Chinese money. The second source added that the ""matter stands complete"".
The finance ministry spokesperson did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
With the latest loan, China's lending to Pakistan in this fiscal year ending in June is set to breach $5 billion.
In the first 10 months of the fiscal year China lent Pakistan $1.5 billion in bilateral loans, according to a finance ministry document seen by Reuters. During this period Pakistan also received $2.9 billion in commercial bank loans mostly from Chinese banks, ministry officials told Reuters.
Beijing's attempts to prop up Pakistan's economy follow a strengthening of ties in the wake of China's pledge to fund badly-needed power and road infrastructure as part of the $57 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), an important cog in Beijing's vast Belt and Road initiative.
But analysts say China's help will not be enough and predict that after the July 25 national election the new administration will likely seek Pakistan's second bailout since 2013, when it received a package worth $6.7 billion from the IMF.
""Looking at the current scenario, it is likely after the new government comes in that they will go to the IMF,"" said Suleman Maniya, head of research at local brokerage house Shajar Capital.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.71% to 94.33.
European Union member states Friday struck a migration deal, agreeing on several measures to tackle the migrant crises in the EU including stepping up border security and setting up holding centers to handle asylum seekers.
The deal was cheered by traders as it eased political uncertainty within the bloc, sending the EUR/USD sharply higher, to $1.1677, up 0.94%.
Ahead of the deal, member states had been in constant disagreement over the handling of migrate crisis: Italy – one of the first port of calls for migrants who manage to survive the trek across the Mediterranean – had threatened to veto any deal if member states did not take ""concrete steps"" to share the influx of migrants.
In German Chancellor Merkel's own backyard, meanwhile, coalition partner, Christian Social Union, had threatened to end the government coalition amid differing views on measures to tackle the migrant crisis.
The rampant euro overshadowed mostly positive U.S. economic data including a report showing U.S. inflation hit the Fed's target, paving the way for the Fed to continue on its rate-hike cycle.
The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure – the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy – rose 2% in the 12 months through May.
The Chicago business barometer, a closely-watched indicator by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), rose to a reading of 64.1 in June from 62.7 the prior month, topping economists' estimates for a reading of 60.0.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.2% last month, the Commerce Department said on Friday, but that was slower than economists had forecast.
But analysts at Stifel downplayed the weakness in consumer spending, citing income growth offered little evidence this was the start of a trend lower in consumer spending, adding that the stronger inflation data would support calls for a faster pace of Federal Reserve rate hikes.
""From the Fed’s point of view, stable wages coupled with a further rise in prices offers additional justification for a potentially accelerated pathway for rates,"" Stifel said Friday.
GBP/USD rallied 0.89% to $1.3194 after the UK economy grew faster-than-expected in the first quarter, renewing investor expectations for a Bank of England rate hike this year.

LONDON (Reuters) - The British pound has suffered its worst quarter since the vote to leave the European Union in June 2016 triggered one of the biggest selloffs in the currency's history.
Worries that Britain will run out of time to agree a deal with the European Union for life after Brexit, a resurgent U.S. dollar and weakness in the economy have combined to hammer the pound, which had started 2018 as one of the best performing major currencies.
(GRAPHIC: Sterling set to post worst quarterly loss since Brexit - https://reut.rs/2tG6Sbx 
Sterling has slumped more than six percent since April to a 7-1/2 month low. That's bigger than the 5.4 percent fall in the euro/dollar exchange rate and a 4.1 percent drop in the yen this quarter.
Against the euro, it has declined one percent (EURGBP=D3).
Hedge funds have a net short sterling position for the first time since November. That is in stark contrast to early 2018 when long positions were at their biggest in three years.
(GRAPHIC: Speculators go short on pound for first time in 7 months - https://reut.rs/2tzXeak) 
The performance since April is also sterling's second-worst quarter since the 2008 financial crisis.
That matters because a strong pound is seen as a barometer of confidence in Britain's economy. Sharp currency drops also risk raising inflation, heaping pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates even if the economy is floundering.
At present, though, the currency is being undermined further by economic weakness which has led the BoE to postpone rate hikes. Current bets for an August rise are about 60 percent but markets are not fully pricing in even one hike for 2018.
Darkening the outlook further are uncertainties over the future trading relationship with the EU and hopes have receded that an EU summit that concludes on Friday would break a deadlock over Brexit issues such as the Irish border.
""At the start of the year the market was too optimistic on sterling,"" said Rabobank strategist Jane Foley. ""We've had a dose of reality. Investors realize now there is a huge lack of clarity on the government's plan for Brexit.""
Rabobank sees a strong chance of an August rate rise but has cut year-end exchange rate targets to $1.28, noting time was running out for a trade deal before Brexit happens next March.
But others are less gloomy and some even predict the pound to recover toward $1.40 as interest rates rise. MUFG analysts also reckon an imminent UK government white paper outlining post-Brexit plans may offer sterling some respite. 
The pound has traded within tight ranges recently and volatility has fallen, possibly because markets already price in the worst-case scenario -- ""hard Brexit"".

But it may also indicate investors have stopped second-guessing outcomes, preferring to sit on the sidelines until the prospect of a clean or disorderly Brexit becomes clear.

At 6:34AM ET (10:34GMT), GBP/USD gained 0.50% to 1.3143.
On Thursday, amid household debt and Brexit concerns, the pound dived to 1.3055, its weakest level since November 2017.
On Friday, the UK Office for National Statistics released its final reading of British gross domestic product for the first quarter of the year showing 0.2% growth quarter-over-quarter. Analysts had expected sluggish growth of just 0.1%.
GDP grew by 1.2% on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter, in line with expectations. Year-over-year previous quarter growth was revised upward from 1.2% to 1.3%.
The Bank of England predicts growth for the second quarter of 0.4%, the ONS will release Q2 GDP on August 10.
At £17.7 billion ($23.3 billion), the current account deficit beat forecasts and was at its lowest level in a year.
The revision in Q1 growth is in line with comments from the Bank of England that first quarter data is often subject to revision. The upward revision increases the likelihood that the BoE will raise rates at its August meeting from 50% to 60%.
Dovish comments from incoming BoE policymaker Jonathan Haskel earlier this week hit expectations for an August rate hike as he said there may be more slack than previously thought in the UK economy.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - After a sharp sell-off, China's yuan and stock markets attempted a modest recovery on Friday, yet investors were grappling with some of their worst losses in years as a bitter Sino-U.S. trade row threatened to ruffle the world's second-biggest economy.
The yuan was set for its biggest monthly fall on record. Chinese stocks, on a downward spiral since late January, were also poised for their largest monthly slide since January 2016.
The downturn highlighted the anxiety among investors as Washington and Beijing showed no signs of backing down from their tariff dispute.
The worry is that an extended selloff in stocks and the yuan could spark a bout of capital outflows, putting further strain on the economy and complicating policy making as authorities put up defenses against the trade battle with the United States. 
The yuan  has shed more than 3 percent of its value against the dollar in June, it's biggest fall since the market exchange rate was unified in 1994. On Friday, it fell to its lowest since mid-November 2017, but pulled up to 6.6139 per dollar by 0600 GMT for a modest bounce of about 0.16 percent on the day.
Offshore, where the yuan trades more freely, the unit  was up by about a quarter of a percent, at 6.6224 per dollar.
In equities, the benchmark CSI300 Index (CSI300) rebounded more than 2 percent, while the Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) gained around 2 percent, though they were both down around 9 percent for the month. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index (HSI) was also up more than 1 percent.

U.S. President Donald Trump has shaken the world trade order by seeking to renegotiate the terms of some of the United States' trading relationships, in particular with China.
The U.S. is targeting $34 billion of Chinese goods for tariffs to take effect on July 6, and has threatened tens of billions of dollars more for similar duties. 
Chinese 10-year treasury futures for September delivery , the most traded contract, leapt 0.34 percent. A fixed income portfolio manager said the sharp rise was a result of central bank promises of ""ample"" liquidity.

CENBANK SUPPORT?
""The central bank is expected to step up efforts to calm investors and slow the pace of the yuan depreciation that has sparked risk aversion across regional markets, including a possible reintroduction of the counter-cyclical factor,"" Gao Qi, FX strategist at Scotiabank in Singapore, wrote in a note on Friday.
He expected ""strong resistance"" at 6.70 yuan per dollar.
Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai Securities, said the rebound in China and Hong Kong stocks was ""technical"", and the yuan's slide was hurting sentiment.
""Negative factors haunting investors are not gone,"" he said.
""Currency is the core, fundamental asset class. A weakening currency is a symptom of waning confidence and reduces risk appetite.""
In 2015, Chinese stock markets cratered and the authorities were widely blamed for a bungled rescue attempt.
Sectors and stocks that were exposed to the depreciating yuan have been hit hard this month.
Real estate <.CSI300REI> was down 5.7 percent and poised for its fifth straight month of losses. The transport sector index <.CSI300TRANS>, whose components include many leading airlines, tumbled 9.4 percent this month and was set for its steepest monthly drop since January 2016.
Flag carrier Air China (SS:601111) has slumped 20.5 percent so far this month, its fourth straight month of losses.

There has been signs of waning foreign interest in China A-shares.
Northbound flows in the cross-broader ""stock connect"" scheme linking Hong Kong and mainland markets last week saw its first weekly net outflows in three months, and is on track to post another week of net selling this week.
Traders said the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has set the daily midpoint stronger than models predicted in recent days, and interpreted it as an attempt to warn the market of making a ""one-way bet"" on depreciation.
A trader at a regional bank in Shanghai who declined to be named said there had been some ""filtering"" of the midpoint fixing, which is set by the central bank each morning, in an apparent bid to keep the yuan from falling too sharply.
""It is too early to say whether the counter-cyclical factor has been revived. If market sentiment could recover by itself, there is no need to use the factor. Market still needs some time to digest,"" the trader said.
In May 2017, the PBOC added a secret ""counter-cyclical factor"" to its formula for calculating the midpoint, which helped put a floor under a falling yuan. It effectively removed the x-factor at the start of this year as the yuan rebounded.
The yuan has held up against other emerging market currencies in the region as well as a basket of currencies the authorities use to measure its value.

The trader said dollar demand was strong this week and could persist until July 6, when U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods are set to take effect.

846,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 12:19AM ET</span>","Euro jumps on EU migration deal, yuan falls again on trade worries","By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - The euro jumped more than a half cent on Friday after European Union leaders reached an agreement on migration, a thorny issue that has threatened EU unity and the fate of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Still, the dollar index is on course to make its first quarterly gain in six while the Chinese yuan looks set to post its biggest fall for a month as traders increasingly worry about the impact of Sino-U.S. trade disputes.
""It's a bit strange but the dollar is strong because investors repatriate funds due to worries about trade disputes, with emerging markets hit the hardest,"" said a trader at a U.S. bank.
""It's just a matter of time before this will hit developed markets too,"" he said. ""When markets see real damage from trade friction in economic data, we could see much larger moves,"" he added.
The euro rose as high as $1.1650 (EUR=), extending its recovery from the one-week low of $1.15275 touched on Thursday, after EU leaders reached the deal on migration. 
If unresolved, the row would have sent a damaging signal about EU unity at a time when the bloc is being assailed by U.S. President Donald Trump on trade and struggling to deal with the legacy of its 2015 crisis, which saw more than one million refugees and migrants enter Europe.
It would have been especially dangerous for Merkel, the EU's longest serving leader, who came under intense pressure from her conservative allies in Bavaria to deliver a deal on migration in Brussels.
The deal improved risk sentiment, undermining the yen while lifting growth-linked currencies such as the Australian dollar.
The yen fell 0.25 percent to 110.75 to the dollar  while Australian dollar  rose 0.3 percent to $0.7376.
TRADE WAR FEARS
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies (DXY) (=USD) stood down 0.5 percent at 94.936 after having risen to as high as 95.534 on Thursday, a level last seen almost a year ago.
Despite Friday's drop, the index was up 5.5 percent this quarter, its first rise since the final quarter of 2016.
The dollar's gains partly stemmed from the prospects of rising U.S. interest rates on the back of solid expansion in the U.S. economy. 
During the past week, the greenback was helped by repatriations ahead of the end of quarter and a half year.
But its overall strength, especially against many emerging currencies, is likely to reflect repatriation on increasing worries about U.S. trade disputes, some traders also said.
One notable currency that has weakened against the dollar is China's yuan , which fell to a 7 1/2-month low of 6.6441 on Friday.
It has lost 3.5 percent this month, surpassing the 2.7 percent fall seen in August 2015, when Beijing shocked markets by unexpectedly guiding the yuan sharply lower.
""We have Chinese economic data coming up tomorrow, one of the first readings after trade tensions have escalated. Chinese PMIs have been essentially flat for some time but if it shows a major deterioration, that could worsen sentiment,"" said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), referring to the official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index due on Saturday.
Caution about a further fall in the yuan was palpable in the options market. 

The implied volatilities of the offshore yuan have risen over the past couple of weeks, with one-week volatility  hitting a five-month high of 6.9 percent, double the levels of just two weeks ago.

849,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",Bank of America Strategist Says He's Never Been This Bullish on the U.S. Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- One long-time dollar bull says the greenback’s charge is just getting started. He just can’t find any clients who agree.
David Woo, head of global rates and foreign exchange strategy at Bank of America , is pounding the table that the dollar’s more than 6 percent rally since mid-April will intensify whether trade tensions dissipate or ratchet higher.
""I’ve never been this bullish the U.S. economy in 20 years I’ve been doing this,"" the strategist said in an interview on Bloomberg Radio, citing the effects of the tax overhaul on corporate behavior. ""That’s the fundamental story here, which is that this economy is growing gangbusters and the market remains in denial.""
His preferred way to express a dollar bias is relative to the euro.
Should trade tensions intensify, European and emerging market economies will bear the brunt of the damage, and those currencies will fall relative to the greenback, he argued. If not, ""this economy is going to go crazy and I’m telling you the dollar is going to surge because we’re going to see a massive repricing of the federal funds rate,"" said Woo.
Indeed, market proxies for how much the U.S. central bank will increase rates during this tightening cycle have ebbed somewhat in recent weeks.
Woo’s take on positioning and sentiment informs his stance on the world’s reserve currency.
Visiting clients on the West Coast, he said he couldn’t find a single one that was long the dollar -- even amid its tear.
Macro tourists, or as Woo calls them cross-over investors, have not aggressively pared their exposure to emerging markets even as those currencies have come under pressure, perhaps due to a dearth of liquidity.
""This also leads me to think that there’s no question this dollar rally is going to keep going,"" he said. ""If you earn 3 percent buying JPMorgan paper, why the hell would you want to buy Brazil at 6 percent?""
If roughly 10 to 20 percent of those crossover investors exited their positions, there would be ""a shockwave through emerging markets,"" said Woo.
As if this wasn’t bad enough, check out this chart:
Meanwhile, China’s need for easier monetary conditions amid a softening economy, ongoing deleveraging campaign, and less supportive global growth backdrop means Beijing has ""a gun pointed at their head"" and no choice but to let their currency decline, he added.

852,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 03:01AM ET</span>",Global trade tensions hit Asian currencies as bears take position: Reuters poll,"By Nikhil Nainan
(Reuters) - Investors raised their short positions in Asian currencies over the past month, a Reuters poll showed, with bets on the Chinese yuan turning bearish for the first time in over a year as Sino-U.S. trade tensions intensified.
An atmosphere of uncertainty has kept investors on the defensive and in search of safe-heaven assets, as the fallout of the U.S. administration's 'America First' agenda spreads to other major economies.
Consequently, demand for the Japanese yen  has firmed, while U.S. debt yields have edged higher, underpinned by the U.S. Federal Reserve's upward path for its benchmark interest rate, with a further two hikes likely this year.
This has kept the dollar (DXY) supported against a basket of six major currencies. The greenback is set for a third consecutive month of gain.
With trade tensions between the world's two largest economies escalating, short bets on the yuan are at their highest since November 2016, the poll of 10 respondents showed.
The Chinese currency  weakened beyond a psychologically key 6.6 per dollar level for the first time in six months on Wednesday. The yuan has lost over 3 percent against the dollar this month alone, an unusually sharp move for the closely-monitored currency.
Expectations have grown that Beijing will allow the yuan to weaken further to soften the impact of trade tariffs imposed by the United States. 
If the trade tensions were to have an impact on Chinese economic growth in the second half, that is going to have a spill over effect on growth in the region, said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research for ANZ.
""Because countries like South Korea and Taiwan do export quite a high portion of their overall exports to China, as part of goods for China to re-export."" 
From Mumbai to Jakarta to Manila, many regional central banks have tightened liquidity by raising rates in order to shore up their respective currencies, stem capital flight and tackle inflation.
At the forefront has been Bank Indonesia, which raised rates twice in May and, according to another Reuters poll, is likely to hike rates for a third time in six weeks on Friday.
Bearish bets on the fragile rupiah  surged to their highest since October 2015. 
Earlier in the week, Southeast Asia's largest economy said its trade deficit narrowed to $1.52 billion in May, but was worse than expected, due to higher oil prices.
Stubbornly high oil prices have added to current deficit woes among net-importers of the commodity, with India being one of them. The United States has told countries to cut imports of Iranian oil from November, adding further upward pressure on prices as India is one of Iran's top customers.
Investors increased their bearish bets slightly on the Indian rupee , despite the central bank raising rates in June for the first time in four years.
The rupee has been the region's worst performing currency, weakening over 7 percent so far this year.
The Philippine peso  comes in a close second as the region's worst performer, prompting the country's central bank to raise interest rates for the second time in six weeks with short positions on the peso at their highest since October 2008.
""The recent emerging market rate hikes are indicative of a sudden rise in the emerging market risk premium, with investors now demanding a higher return to compensate for perceptions of increased risks,"" Mizuho Bank said in a note on Tuesday.
The risk premium is correlated to global trade growth which is under profound pressure from U.S. trade policies, Mizuho said.
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: The Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.
The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar was steady against its peers on Thursday, having failed to extend overnight gains amid conflicting signals from Washington on a proposal to restrict Chinese investment as the bitter U.S.-China trade row kept financial markets on edge. 
Demand stoked by the looming end of 2018's first half was seen supporting the dollar, which was not dented by lower U.S. yields and a slide in Wall Street shares.
The dollar index (DXY) against a basket of six major currencies stood steady at 95.266 after rallying 0.65 percent the previous day.
The greenback had advanced after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he will use a strengthened national security review process to thwart Chinese acquisitions of sensitive American technologies, a softer approach than imposing China-specific investment restrictions. 
There was, however, some confusion about Washington's intentions - with U.S. shares making an about-turn and dropping - after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Fox Business Network later on Wednesday that Trump's announced plan did not indicate a softened stance on China.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had favored a more measured and global approach to protecting U.S. technology, using authority approved by Congress, while White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, the administration's harshest China critic, had argued for China-specific restrictions.
""The dollar has managed to stay buoyant despite a drop in Treasury yields and risk-off in U.S. stocks due to half year-end flows, which involves U.S. investors buying back the dollar,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
""It remains to be seen how long flow-driven bids can support the dollar. Headlines on trade issues will continue to dictate direction once such flows subside.""
The dollar was flat at 110.23 yen . The currency rose to 110.49 the previous day before pulling back slightly following Kudlow's comments on Trump's investment restriction plans.
The euro was a shade higher at $1.1567 (EUR=) after shedding 0.8 percent overnight. Concerns over political complications in Germany are expected to be a drag on the single currency.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel's fragile coalition government faces potential collapse as the Christian Social Union (CSU), her Bavarian ally, has threatened to defy her and impose border controls unless their demands to reduce Germany's immigration burden are met. 
At the European Council Summit later on Thursday, Merkel will try to secure agreements on immigration on a continental level to appease the CSU. 
""The odds are seemingly against Merkel obtaining a meaningful solution and the euro looks set to suffer further declines depending on the headlines coming out of the summit,"" said Daisuke Karakama, chief market economist at Mizuho Bank.
The Australian dollar managed a modest bounce after sliding the previous day on lingering U.S.-China trade tensions. The Aussie was up 0.2 percent at $0.7356  after plumbing a 1-1/2-year trough of $0.7323 on Wednesday.

China's yuan continued its slide, touching a new six-month low of 6.626 per dollar  amid Sino-U.S. trade tensions.

The decision to back CFIUS and not the somewhat harsher International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 – which would have allowed Trump to unilaterally impose restrictions – sparked risk appetite, sending safe-haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc sharply lower against the greenback.
USD/JPY rose 0.25% to Y110.34, while USD/CHF rose 0.50% 0.9962.
Mixed U.S. economic data showing an unexpected narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit and weaker durable goods orders did little to curb demand for the dollar.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday Core Durable Goods Orders fell 0.3% last month, missing economist forecast for a 0.5% rise.
The US trade deficit narrowed to $64.85 billion, well below economists' forecasts of $68.9 billion, from a revised $67.34 billion.
The dollar's move higher was also supported by a slump in both the euro and sterling as the latter was weighed down by Brexit angst, and uncertainty as to whether the Bank of England would hike interest rates this year.

The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) set the weakest yuan mid-point rate since December 25, 2017, a move seen as China’s way of absorbing the shocks of the ongoing U.S.- China trade spat.
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against six major currencies stood at 94.30 on Wednesday at 11:54PM ET (03:54GMT), down 0.01%. The index fell to a low point of 93.94 on Monday over worries of escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and its trade partners, but a modest easing in concerns slightly revived risk appetite.
U.S. President Donald Trump suggested during a meeting with lawmakers that his administration may switch to foreign investment reviews under the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States instead of imposing new limits on Chinese investment in U.S. technology.
The PBOC set the yuan reference rate at 6.5569 – the weakest fix since last December- versus Tuesday’s 6.5180. 
The yuan continued to lose ground against the dollar. The USD/CNY pair was trading at 6.5954, up 0.24%. Last Sunday, the Chinese central bank announced the injection of USD100 billion into the economy by reducing the Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR) for banks to help the economy cope up with the pressures of a trade war with the U.S.
The sliding yuan dragged Aussie lower with it, too. The AUD/USD pair slipped 0.18% and was trading at 0.7379 on Wednesday morning.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held steady against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, its earlier bounce from two-week lows flagging amid lingering trade conflict concerns.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was steady at 94.652 (DXY) after gaining 0.4 percent overnight to snap a four-session losing run.
While a modest easing in concerns over an escalating trade row between the United States and its trade partners had lifted the dollar off a two-week trough of 94.171, wariness lingered and capped the dollar.
Underlining investor caution, equity markets in Asia extended losses and slipped across the board on Wednesday.
""The spat is beginning to have an actual impact on corporate behavior and this is the difference from the earlier stages of the trade row,"" said Koji Fukaya, president at FPG Securities in Tokyo.
""The 'risk off' trend has started to impact corporations in the developed markets, clouding the outlook for their economies and suppressing dollar demand.""
The dollar was 0.1 percent lower at 109.92 yen , after going as high as 110.23 on Tuesday. The yen is often sought in times of market turmoil and political tensions.
""The dollar lacks guidance from U.S. yields, which have been directionless. Furthermore, it is difficult to gauge whether the Trump administration is poised to become even more conservative toward trade issues or if it wants to ease its stance,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield (US10YT=RR) was unchanged at 2.882 percent. The yield has been confined in June to a 15 basis point range after fluctuating by nearly 40 basis points in May, during which it touched a seven-year high of 3.128 percent.
The euro was a shade higher at $1.1657 (EUR=) after losing 0.5 percent overnight, when a rise in Italian bond yields ahead of debt auctions later this week soured sentiment toward the single currency.
Italy will sell five- and 10-year bonds on Thursday, with the auctions seen as a test of investor appetite for the country's debt following the political turmoil that gripped Rome last month.
Sterling was effectively flat at $1.3224 .
The pound had dropped 0.45 percent on Tuesday after an incoming Bank of England policymaker expressed caution over Britain's readiness for higher interest rates and uncertainty over the impact of Brexit on the economy.
The trade-sensitive Australian dollar was down 0.25 percent at $0.7371 , edging back toward a 13-month low of $0.7345 plumbed last week.
The Chinese yuan slipped to a new six-month low of 6.615 per dollar  after the People's Bank of China (PBOC) lowered the currency's midpoint for the sixth straight day to its weakest in six months.

The yuan had slumped on Tuesday on expectations that Beijing will let the currency weaken further to soften the impact of trade tariffs imposed by the United States.
 
"
862,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 26, 2018 06:50PM ET</span>",China's Role as Market Anchor at Risk With Rapid Yuan Slide,"(Bloomberg) -- The slump in China’s yuan is stoking fear that policy makers are less willing to temper the currency’s decline as the economy slows and a trade battle with the U.S. worsens.
That’s a sharp turnaround from just a few weeks ago, when the yuan was in effect serving as an anchor for emerging economies facing rising global interest rates and a strengthening dollar. For some, the yuan’s drop has even evoked parallels to the deliberate devaluation in 2015 that roiled global markets, though China watchers discount the idea of depreciation being deployed as an outright trade-policy tool.
“The yuan now is a source of volatility, not stability,” said Michael Every, head of financial markets research at Rabobank Group in Hong Kong. Further weakness in China’s currency would be expected to “hit the whole emerging-market complex, and to wallop commodity prices,” he said.
The yuan has slumped 2.7 percent against the dollar since June 14, when a raft of economic data came in below expectations. Selling deepened along with President Donald Trump’s threat to keep escalating tariff hikes until a potential $450 billion of Chinese shipments are targeted. The offshore yuan fell the past nine days, the longest losing streak since 2014; it was little changed in early trading Wednesday.
“There’s some risk now the depreciation of the yuan may feed back into other dollar-Asia” exchange rates, said Cliff Tan, Hong Kong-based East Asian head of global markets research at MUFG Bank Ltd.
There are fundamental reasons for the yuan’s retreat. Monthly economic data for May showed an unexpectedly sharp slowdown in the world’s No. 2 economy, days after a separate release showed a big drop-off in credit growth. The People’s Bank of China also has shifted gears, injecting more liquidity in the economy.
More Flexible
So it’s not clear that the yuan’s drop is down to government direction, according to Zhang Zhiwei, chief China economist at  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) in Hong Kong.
""It seems the central bank is willing to let the currency become flexible, but I don’t think they want to have a big devaluation,"" Zhang said. ""China wouldn’t use depreciation actively -- say, guiding the currency lower, or using a one-off devaluation -- as a weapon in the trade war, because it would hurt China as well.""
Unlike reciprocal tariff hikes on the U.S. or regulatory moves against American companies operating in China, outright devaluation would be a blunt and multilateral tool that affects all of the nation’s trading partners. The move also could reprise fears of continuous yuan depreciation and capital outflows that were triggered by the abrupt lowering of the yuan’s exchange rate in August 2015. After that episode, policy makers ultimately spent $1 trillion of the country’s foreign-exchange reserves and had to tighten capital controls to stabilize the currency.
Policy Concern
The MSCI ACWI Index of global stocks slumped about 12 percent by the end of September 2015, and oil prices halved by early 2016, in part thanks to deepening fears of a China hard landing. President Xi Jinping’s team got an earful of concern about its policies at the time from the global community, from figures including IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde.
“They have learned their lesson,” said Jean-Charles Sambor, deputy head of emerging market debt at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management in London. “There could be some downward pressure on the RMB, but not a massive depreciation risk, because they know it could change sentiment toward the RMB and trigger additional outflows again,” he said, referring to the renminbi, the official name for China’s currency.
Yuan Floor
For now the yuan’s resilience is waning compared with its trading partners. The Bloomberg replica of the CFETS RMB Index, which tracks the yuan against a basket of 24 peers, slumped 1.6 percent over the past week. Sue Trinh, head of Asia foreign-exchange strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong, calculates that the drop over the past month has now reached a two standard-deviation depreciation event -- for only the fourth time since the 2015 devaluation.
China would be more likely to put a floor under the yuan if talks with the U.S. progress on trade, Trinh says. “In the short term, the yuan’s moves will depend on the trade negotiations,” she said. “In the long term, the depreciation will continue due to slower growth and the policy divergence between China and the U.S.”
It will be key to watch China’s daily yuan fixings to see if the PBOC is taking steps to slow the yuan’s depreciation, Trinh said.
China has some fundamentals in its favor, including a current-account surplus. The largest emerging market is also seeing increasing interest in its domestic securities, now that they are more accessible with inclusion for some of its stocks in MSCI international indexes and the ability of foreign investors to buy bonds via Hong Kong.
Rabobank’s Every sees modest further depreciation this year, with the yuan reaching 6.75 by the end of December, versus 6.5761 late in Shanghai Tuesday -- a drop of about 3 percent. But the latest slide has stoked fears of worse.
Ex-U.S. Treasury official Brad Setser tweeted this week that what worries him is if China decided “it wants a weaker currency to offset the impact of U.S. tariffs on its export and on its economy. And further dollar strength in turn destabilizes other emerging markets.”

Safe-haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc pared some of their recent gains against the dollar as investors continued to pile into U.S. assets, betting the U.S. economy would fare better in an all-out trade war.
USD/JPY rose 0.15% to Y109.94, while USD/CHF tacked on 0.28% to 0.9878.
Investors have added about $40 billion to U.S. equity funds and another $8 billion to U.S bond funds since April to shelter capital from trade war risks, said the Institute of International Finance.

The greenback had climbed to the 11-month peak as higher U.S. yields underlined the divergence in monetary policies between the United States and Europe.
The dollar, however, began to sag toward the end of last week as U.S. yields lost their lift amid heightened trade tensions between Washington and the European Union. The 10-year Treasury note yield (US10YT=RR) fell to a one-week low of 2.871 percent on Monday.
The euro was steady at $1.1654 (EUR=) after gaining about 0.5 percent on Friday. The single currency was lifted after Friday's upbeat German and French business activity data and fresh assurances by Italian politicians that their nation would not leave the single currency.
""The euro is on a technical bounce but whether it can retain the uptrend depends on how the US-EU trade tensions pan out,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""The trade spat has helped drive down both U.S. and German debt yields, and both the euro and dollar could lose out if tensions intensify,"" he said. ""The yen could end up the winner in such a case by attracting safety bids.""
Commodity-linked currencies dipped as a surge by crude oil prices ran out of steam amid the latest round of trade jitters.
Oil had rallied on Friday after OPEC agreed to an unexpectedly modest increase in production from next month after Saudi Arabia persuaded Iran to cooperate.
The Australian dollar was down 0.3 percent at $0.7418  after gaining 0.85 percent on Friday. The Aussie had fallen to a one-year low of $0.7394 last week, hurt by the Sino-U.S. trade spat.
The Canadian dollar slipped 0.25 percent to C$1.3295  per dollar after advancing 0.4 percent on Friday. The loonie had brushed a one-year low of C$1.3384 last week, buffeted by volatility in crude oil prices.
The Turkish lira  was up about 0.5 percent at 4.64 per dollar, after jumping as much as 1.6 percent earlier.

The lira had initially soared after Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling AK Party claimed victory in presidential and parliamentary elections on Sunday, overcoming the biggest electoral challenge to their rule in a decade and a half.

872,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 24, 2018 11:12PM ET</span>","Forex - Yuan Continues to Slide Against Dollar, PBOC Cuts Bank Reserve Ratio ","Investing.com - The yuan continued to weaken against the US dollar amid the prospects of a trade war continue to hang over the market and China’s central bank announced plans to free up almost USD108 billion worth of liquidity to shore up the economy.
The People’s Bank of China said on Sunday, June 24, that it would lower the required reserve requirement (RRR) ratio of some banks by 0.5% as of July 5. The current RRR requires large banks to hold 16% of their capital in reserve and smaller banks to hold 14%. China uses the RRR as a tool to manage liquidity in the economy.
The cut had been widely expected but the size of it was something of a surprise. Altogether, the cuts will release as much as CNY700 billion that banks can now use to lend. The PBOC said on Monday that liquidity is at a relatively high level.
The yuan has been sliding against the dollar. It hit a five-month low on Friday against the USD and the PBOC set the reference rate Monday at 6.4893. The Monday reference rate was also the lowest in five months against the USD.
The yuan continued to lose ground against the USD in morning trade in Asia Monday. The USD/CNY pair was trading at 6.5174 as of 10:00 PM ET (2:00 AM GMT), up 0.42%.
The yen strengthened against the dollar Monday morning, with the USD/JPY pair down 0.43% to 109.50.
The US Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, fell in morning trade and was trading at 94.4960. The USD has been strengthening since April but the looming trade war is starting to create jitters on the market.
Meanwhile, a jump in oil prices helped shore up the Australian dollar Friday. The oil rally and a slight weakening in the USD helped the Aussie regain some losses from earlier in the week.

873,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 24, 2018 10:40PM ET</span>",China's Yuan Sinks to Five-Month Low on Worsening Trade Outlook,"(Bloomberg) -- A selloff in China’s currency deepened after the central bank moved to free up capital for banks and as investors braced for the next round in an escalating trade dispute with the U.S. Stocks fluctuated, while government bonds were little changed.
The yuan slid as much as 0.4 percent to 6.5223 per dollar, its weakest since Jan. 10, while the offshore exchange rate dropped for an eighth day. The Shanghai Composite Index added 0.1 percent and the yield on 10-year debt held near a two-month low. The People’s Bank of China on Sunday said it will cut the required reserve ratio for some banks by 0.5 percentage point.
A slew of negative factors -- from a trade war with the U.S. to the risk of a credit crunch -- has weighed on China’s financial markets in recent weeks. The benchmark Shanghai stock index is on the brink of a bear market after tumbling almost 20 percent from its recent high, while analysts have started cutting their forecasts for the nation’s currency. Investors have been piling into the relative safety of government debt instead.
“The yuan is faced with a double whammy –- escalating trade tensions are hurting sentiment and the easier monetary policy is also pressuring the currency,"" said Gao Qi, a currency strategist at Scotiabank in Singapore. ""Traders will step up shorting the yuan in the offshore market, but we won’t likely see massive fund outflows considering the capital curbs in place.""
The Treasury Department is planning to heighten scrutiny of Chinese investments in sensitive U.S. industries under an emergency law. Under the plan, the White House would use one of the most significant legal measures available to declare China’s investment in U.S. companies involved in technologies such as new-energy vehicles, robotics and aerospace a threat to economic and national security, according to eight people familiar with the plans.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 0.3 percent. Energy shares rallied, led by Cnooc Ltd., after crude surged, while casinos and Chinese developers retreated.
The 10 year-yield hovered at 3.59 percent. Last time the PBOC cut the reserve ratio, in April, the yield fell the most since 2016.
“The bond market is a little disappointed, as many traders were expecting a one-percentage-point cut and some of them took profit,” said David Qu, an economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Shanghai. “The room for further declines in the yield is limited, as interest rates are rising globally and a marginally loose Chinese monetary policy is already priced in.”

874,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2018 12:34PM ET</span>",Iran rial plunges to new lows as U.S. sanctions loom,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The Iranian rial plunged to a record low against the U.S. dollar on the unofficial market on Sunday, continuing its slide amid fears of returning U.S. sanctions after President Donald Trump in May withdrew from a deal on Tehran's nuclear program. 
The dollar was being offered for as much as 87,000 rials, compared to around 75,500 on Thursday, the last trading day before Iran's weekend, according to foreign exchange website Bonbast.com, which tracks the unofficial market. 
Iran's semi-official news agency ISNA said the dollar had climbed to 87,000 rials on Sunday from about 74,000 before the weekend on the black market, and several Iranian websites carried similar reports.
The currency has been sliding for months because of a weak economy, financial difficulties at local banks and heavy demand for dollars among Iranians who fear the pullout by Washington from the nuclear deal and renewed U.S. sanctions against Tehran could shrink the country's exports of oil and other goods.
The fall of the national currency has provoked a public outcry over the quick rise of prices of imported consumer goods.
Merchants at the mobile phone shopping centers Aladdin and Charsou in central Tehran protested against the rapid depreciation of the rial by shutting down their shops on Sunday, the semi-official news agency Fars reported.
A video posted on social media showed protesters marching and chanting ""strike, strike!"" The footage could not be authenticated independently by Reuters. 
Hours later, Information and Communications Technology Minister Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi said on Twitter that he visited the protesting merchants. 
""I will try to help provide hard currency for (mobile) equipment (imports),"" Azari-Jahromi wrote, adding: ""The merchants' activity has now gone back to normal.""
Some of the U.S. sanctions against Iran take effect after a 90-day ""wind-down"" period ending on Aug. 6, and the rest, most notably on the petroleum sector, after a 180-day ""wind-down"" period ending on Nov. 4.
The rial has weakened from around 65,000 rials just before Trump's announcement of the U.S. withdrawal in early May, and from 42,890 at the end of last year - a freefall that threatens to boost inflation, hurt living standards and reduce the ability of Iranians to travel abroad.
In an effort to halt the slide, Iranian authorities announced in April they were unifying the dollar's official and black market exchange rates at a single level of 42,000, and banning any trade at other rates under the threat of arrest.

But this step has failed to stamp out the unofficial market because authorities have been supplying much less hard currency through official channels than consumers are demanding. Free market trade simply went underground, dealers said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Speculators turned bullish on the dollar for the first time since July last year, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday, as sentiment improved after the Federal Reserve forecast two more interest rate hikes this year.
The value of the net long dollar position was $8.64 billion in the week ended June 19, shifting from a net short of $7.42 billion the previous week. This week's net long dollar position was the largest since May 16 last year.U.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.
In a wider measure of dollar positioning <0#NETUSDFX=> that includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian ruble, the U.S. dollar posted a net long position equivalent to $10.38 billion, up from a net short position of $7.10 billion previous week.
That was the largest net long positioning since mid-May, Reuters data showed.
""This is capitulation of the dollar shorts that were in position at the beginning of the year,"" said Karl Schamotta, director of global product and market strategy, at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto.
""Monetary tightening is continuing at pace in the United States while there has been a moderation in terms of expectations around the ECB (European Central Bank) and other major central banks,"" he added.
Last week, the Federal Reserve further accelerated a dollar rally when it raised interest rates as expected, and signaled two more hikes this year, citing higher inflation.
But before that Fed decision, the dollar was already on an upward trajectory amid a round of robust U.S. economic data. Since mid-April, the dollar has rallied by more than 7 percent.
In the cryptocurrency market, speculators' net short position on bitcoin Cboe futures fell to 1,595 contracts <0#1CFTC1330E1> from net shorts of 1,945 the previous week, the data showed.
Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market, however, remained mired in a bearish trend amid intense regulatory scrutiny.
The virtual currency on Friday fell as low as $6,085.59 (BTC=BTSP) on Bitstamp, the lowest since early February and not far from this year's trough of just below $6,000. It was last down nearly 9 percent at $6,119.08.

884,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2018 02:26AM ET</span>",Malaysia picks ex-deputy governor who probed 1MDB to helm central bank,"By Joseph Sipalan
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia has named Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus, a former central bank deputy who was involved in investigating the 1MDB scandal, as the new governor of Bank Negara Malaysia, a spokesman for the prime minister said on Friday.
Her appointment comes after the exit of Muhammad Ibrahim less than halfway through his five-year term, seen as a fallout from the scandal after the finance ministry said funds from a central bank deal with the previous government were used to pay some of 1MDB's debts.
After a shock election result last month put former premier Mahathir Mohamad back in power, his administration has reopened investigations into alleged corruption and money laundering at 1Malaysia Development Berhad. Officials seen as close to the previous government led by Najib Razak have been replaced.
The new central bank governor takes over at a time when there are uncertainties over the economic policies of Mahathir's administration, which effectively scrapped a consumption tax and introduced fuel subsidies within a month of assuming power.
Foreign investors have pulled out of Malaysian equities and ratings agencies have expressed concerns over the country's fiscal strength.
""Nor Shamsiah's appointment implies continuity in the direction and conduct of monetary policy,"" analysts at Nomura said. 
The ringgit currency  strengthened slightly on news of her appointment.
A finance ministry statement on Nor Shamsiah's appointment is expected later on Friday.
CONTINUITY
Nor Shamsiah joined Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) in 1987 after getting an accounting degree from the University of South Australia, and was appointed to two three-years terms, in 2010 and 2013, as a deputy governor. She left the central bank when her second term ended in November 2016, six months after Muhammad became governor.
Past BNM statements have said Nor Shamsiah has extensive experience in the development of prudential regulation, legislation, policies and guidelines for the financial sector. The central bank also said she was involved in the financial sector resolution initiatives during the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis.
She assisted with the 1MDB investigation when Muhammad's predecessor as governor, Zeti Akhtar Aziz, who retired after 16 years at the helm in 2016, was in charge. After again becoming prime minister, Mahathir appointed Zeti as a member of his advisory council.
On June 6, Mahathir accepted the resignation of Muhammad as central bank governor. Analysts linked his exit to revelations last month that about $500 million raised from a land sale by the government to the central bank was used to pay 1MDB's liabilities last year.
In late May, the central bank defended the deal, saying it had initiated the purchase of the land and that it was conducted as an arms-length transaction and complied with all governance requirements.

In an email to staff on June 6, Muhammad said the central bank did not know the funds from the land deal would be used to settle 1MDB debt.

886,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 06:00PM ET</span>",Mexico Raises Rate as Peso Weakness Spurs Inflation Concerns,"(Bloomberg) -- Mexico increased borrowing costs for the second time this year as higher U.S. interest rates, global trade tensions and the July 1 presidential election have battered the country’s peso, posing a risk to inflation. The currency strengthened on the decision.
Policy makers, led by bank Governor Alejandro Diaz de Leon raised the key interest rate a quarter-point to 7.75 percent, matching the forecast of 18 of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Six analysts expected no change in policy while one saw a half-point hike.
Central banks across the globe are inching toward tighter policy after years of extraordinary stimulus. Mexico’s decision came a week since the Federal Reserve raised rates for a second time this year and hours after the Bank of England left the door open for a rate increase in August.
Mexico’s move Thursday was unanimous and came with a pledge by the central bank board to continue its prudent monetary policy. The decision also comes as President Donald Trump threatens to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement and as leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador appears poised to win the July 1 presidential election.
The decision had ""a hawkish tone as expected,"" said Marco Oviedo, chief Latin American economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc. ""The next move will likely depend on the market reaction to the election outcome.""
The peso strengthened on the rate hike, rising 0.6 percent to 20.2325 per dollar. Since mid-April the peso has been the worst performer among major currencies, declining 11 percent, even after rebounding slightly this week.
The board said in its decision that the balance of risks to inflation has worsened, while the outlook for growth remains to the downside. The bank is concerned that inflation is being hit by several shocks and convergence to target is compromised, Oviedo said before the decision, adding that peso weakness will likely keep inflation very close to 4 percent for the rest of 2018.
Why Some Emerging Markets Are Suddenly Melting Down: QuickTake
The central bank targets inflation at 3 percent. While the consumer price index has been falling steadily from a 16-year high reached at the end of December, some economists don’t see it slowing to target as soon as previously expected.
Inflation missed analysts’ expectations in May when it slowed to 4.51 percent compared to the 4.46 percent forecast in a Bloomberg survey. Adding more pressure are new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum, which Moody’s Investors Service says could delay inflation’s return to 3 percent by a couple of months.
Not all economists were expecting a rate increase. The central bank is ""clearly worried about inflation pressures building from the weakness in the peso and the rise in energy prices,"" said Rafael de la Fuente, chief Latin America economist at UBS AG, who had expected the rate to remain on hold. ""Both risks are legitimate, but not sure they rise to the level of raising rates in my view.""

The biggest risk to the peso, and therefore inflation, is Nafta. The currency has been in a free-fall since a Nafta deadline was missed in May, and continued to sink as the Trump administration threatened to impose sweeping new tariffs on imported automobiles. The peso kept depreciating after steel tariffs took effect in June, and economists began reversing their forecasts for rate cuts to a hike in Mexico. Now, Mexican and Canadian negotiators say they expect to pick up talks again in July, after Mexico goes to the polls.
Lopez Obrador’s gains in the polls have also roiled the currency. He’s pledged to boost spending on social programs, while failing to fully convince investors he’ll have the savings to do so. He’s also clashed with business groups after generating uncertainty about the future of private oil drilling in Mexico and a $13 billion new airport project.

The Philadelphia Fed said Thursday its manufacturing index for June fell to a reading of 19.9, from 28.9 last month, missing economists' estimates for a reading of 28.9.
That overshadowed positive data on the labor market front, as initial jobless claims dropped by 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 218,000 for the week ended June 16, beating economists’ forecast for a rise to 220,000.
A firmer yen and rebound in sterling also sparked a reversal in the greenback.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell off an 11-month high on Thursday against a basket of major currencies as the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's gauge of U.S. Mid-Atlantic business activity fell to a near 1-1/2 year low, spurring profit-taking on the greenback.
The euro recovered from its weakest level since July 2017 which was tied to bets on a protracted period of monetary policy divergence between the U.S. and European central banks. 
The single currency was also pressured earlier after the Italian government appointed two eurosceptics to head key finance committees, reigniting worries about anti-euro voices in the euro zone's third-largest economy.
""Philly Fed missed on the downside. That was a convenient excuse for traders to take profits,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst with Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.
The Philadelphia Fed said its barometer on U.S. Mid-Atlantic business activity fell from 34.4 in May to 19.9 in June, its lowest since November 2016.
The index's sharpest drop since January 2014 came amid escalation in a U.S.-China trade conflict, which has underpinned safe-haven support for the dollar in recent days.
""It does loom as a potential headwind for the U.S. and global economy,"" Manimbo said of the rising trade tensions.
The world's top central bankers at a conference in Sintra, Portugal on Wednesday acknowledged that a serious dispute with more tariffs would weaken their economic outlook, although they have not altered their policy stance for now.
At 10:25 a.m. (1425 GMT), an index that tracks the dollar against the euro, yen, sterling and three other currencies (DXY) slipped 0.1 percent to 94.926 after touching 95.529 earlier Thursday, which was its highest since mid-July 2017.
The euro rebounded from an 11-month low to $1.1592 (EUR=), while the greenback decreased 0.4 percent to 110.93 yen . 
Elsewhere, sterling  rose over 0.5 percent at $1.3243, recovering from a seven-month trough after the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, unexpectedly joined those calling for rates to rise to 0.75 percent, citing concerns about growing wage pressure.
Haldane's vote, however, was not enough to flip the BOE's decision to leave key borrowing costs at 0.5 percent. 
Meanwhile, even as the Swiss National Bank as expected clung to its negative interest rate policy, the Swiss currency rose against the euro (EURCHF=) to 1.1499 franc as some traders saw a slightly more hawkish tone from the central bank. 
Norway's central bank also kept rates on hold but said it was on track to raise rates in September, sending the Norwegian crown to an eight-month peak versus the euro (EURNOK=D3) at 9.3900.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar was little changed on Wednesday, hovering near an 11-month peak against a basket of major currencies as China's signal of a tolerance of a stronger yuan offset anxiety about the global trade conflict.
The greenback, as well as the yen and Swiss franc, remained well supported as traders braced for possibly another round of tariffs.

Before Wednesday's market open, the People's Bank of China cut the yuan's midpoint rate  to 6.4586 per dollar, the weakest level since Jan. 12 and much stronger than market models had suggested.

The Aussie tumbled below 74 cents on Tuesday for the first time in a year amid a worsening trade dispute between the U.S. and China, Australia’s largest trading partner. The currency faces more pressure as policy divergence sees Australian bond yields drop further below those of U.S. Treasuries, said Craig Vardy, BlackRock’s head of fixed income for Australia. The Aussie last traded at 70 cents in February 2016.
“There are conditions that could get it there -- rate differentials is definitely one of them, the potential for China slowing is another,” Vardy said in an interview this week in Sydney. Slowing local lending growth may also add strain to the economy and currency, he said.
BlackRock joins the growing ranks of asset managers turning bearish on the Aussie as growth in China cools even before threatened U.S. trade tariffs take effect. Heaping on more pressure is a Fed that has already raised interest rates seven times since December 2015, while the Reserve Bank of Australia is forecast to keep its benchmark at a record low until at least the middle of next year.

The Aussie may extend declines to the “mid-60s” within the next 12 months, Pendal Group said last week, while Westpac Banking Group said it may drop to 70 cents in 2019.

BlackRock in the first quarter cut its six-month forecast for the Aussie to a range of 78 to 73 cents, from an earlier prediction of 80 to 75, Vardy said. “Probably 73 sees it out in the short term, however on a longer-term horizon there is potential for it to go below that,” he said.

Australia’s 10-year bond yield fell five basis points Tuesday to close at 2.61 percent, compared with 2.87 percent for similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries. The Aussie yield shortfall may swell to 50 basis points in 2019 amid further monetary policy divergence, Vardy said.
A booming American economy means the U.S. dollar is poised to extend recent gains, potentially rising another 5 percent, Vardy said. Further Fed tightening should see benchmark Treasury yields climb to 3.25 percent by year-end, he said.
“You’ve got a Fed tightening, and you’ve got the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, the other key central banks, not really wanting to do anything,” he said. “It absolutely points to a stronger dollar.”

900,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 19, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>",BlackRock Says Aussie May Drop to 70 Cents as China Growth Slows,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s dollar is at risk of sliding to 70 U.S. cents this year as China’s economy slows and the Federal Reserve keeps raising U.S. interest rates, according to BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).
The Aussie tumbled below 74 cents on Tuesday for the first time in a year amid a worsening trade dispute between the U.S. and China, Australia’s largest trading partner. The currency faces more pressure as policy divergence sees Australian bond yields drop further below those of U.S. Treasuries, said Craig Vardy, BlackRock’s head of fixed income for Australia. The Aussie last traded at 70 cents in February 2016.
“There are conditions that could get it there -- rate differentials is definitely one of them, the potential for China slowing is another,” Vardy said in an interview this week in Sydney. Slowing local lending growth may also add strain to the economy and currency, he said.
BlackRock joins the growing ranks of asset managers turning bearish on the Aussie as growth in China cools even before threatened U.S. trade tariffs take effect. Heaping on more pressure is a Fed that has already raised interest rates seven times since December 2015, while the Reserve Bank of Australia is forecast to keep its benchmark at a record low until at least the middle of next year.

Fears of full-blown trade war came to the fore Tuesday as China vowed to retaliate to the latest trade salvo from the White House after Trump had threatened to impose a 10% tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods.
That ushered in a wave of demand for safe-haven yen, keeping the dollar's upside momentum in check.

The Commerce Department said Tuesday U.S. homebuilding rose 5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.350 million units in May, well above economists’ estimates for a 1.4% rise.
The report also highlighted a sharp 4.6% decline in building permits to a rate of 1.301 million units.
Analysts warned that the bullish uptick in housing starts was partly supported by the weather, and claimed that the less volatile building permits data was more telling of the underlying housing construction market.
""The pace of permit issuance is much less sensitive to the weather than starts, and it usually reflects the pace of new home sales, which may have peaked for this cycle,"" Pantheon said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rose to an 11-month high on Tuesday and the euro slumped after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened more tariffs on China in an escalating trade dispute investors fear could hurt global growth.
Hostility over trade between the world's two largest economies intensified on Tuesday when Trump threatened to impose a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods, prompting a swift warning from Beijing of retaliation.
Months of tit-for-tat trade measures between Beijing and Washington have had a fairly limited impact on currencies up to now. But this week's threats have hurt currencies including the Australian dollar and Swedish crown, vulnerable to protectionist measures.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies as traders bet on a escalating trade war forcing inflation up in the U.S. because of costlier imports, raising the prospect of more interest rate rises.
Chinese stocks sank almost 4 percent and the yuan slumped to a five-month low overnight.
""Asian currencies and stocks are feeling most of the impact compared to Europe but that could quickly change if this escalates,"" said fund manager Constantin Bolz of German-based wealth management firm Portfolio Concept.
Investors bought currencies traditionally considered safe havens.
The Japanese yen climbed 0.8 percent against the dollar to 109.56 yen, its highest level in a week  and the Swiss franc rose 0.3 percent against the dollar to 0.9918 franc. 
Traders are divided other whether the row will affect the dollar meaningfully.
Currency markets in general dislike trade intervention, and previous protectionist efforts by the U.S. government have weakened the dollar.
On Tuesday, however, the dollar strengthened half a percent versus a basket of major currencies to hit $95.266, its highest since July 2017. (DXY)
""If the situation were to escalate the main beneficiary would be the U.S. dollar,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategist Thu Lan Nguyen. 
""And of course a far-reaching trade war would be detrimental for everyone in the end, but mainly the countries whose growth heavily depends on foreign trade,"" she said.
EURO UNDER PRESSURE 
China's commerce ministry responded on Tuesday by saying Beijing would fight back firmly with ""qualitative"" and ""quantitative"" measures if the United States publishes additional tariffs.
The yuan slid to a low of 6.4490 to the dollar at one point, its weakest since Jan. 15.
The euro, meanwhile, remained under heavy pressure due to a dispute in Germany's governing coalition and expectations the European Central Bank will hold interest rates steady into 2019.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's Bavarian allies may defy her by implementing a plan to limit immigration at the German border, which could destabilize her three-month-old coalition.
The single currency on Tuesday slumped to a two-week low of $1.1531. (EUR=EBS) after ECB President Mario Draghi called for a patient approach to European monetary policy at a forum in Portugal. 
The euro had its biggest fall in two years last Thursday after Draghi offered dovish guidance for monetary tightening while outlining details of the end of quantitative easing. 
Investors and businesses worry that a full-blown trade battle could derail global growth.
The Australian dollar, a liquid hedge for risk, sank to a one-year low of A$ 0.7380 on the escalating trade dispute and as base metal prices slid. 
The Canadian dollar, meanwhile, weakened to a one-year low of C$ 1.3237 overnight, before paring some of its losses on Tuesday, as investors worried about Canada's own trade feud with the United States. 

Emerging market currencies also came under pressure, with the South African rand shedding 1.9 percent to touch its seven-month low of 13.9150.

In a statement on Monday, Trump said he had asked U.S. representatives to identify Chinese goods that would be subject to the new tariffs. The move would be in retaliation for China’s decision to raise tariffs on $50 billion in U.S. goods, which was in itself in response to new U.S. tariffs.
""China apparently has no intention of changing its unfair practices related to the acquisition of American intellectual property and technology. Rather than altering those practices, it is now threatening United States companies, workers, and farmers who have done nothing wrong,"" said Trump. 
He added that ""after the legal process is complete, these tariffs will go into effect if China refuses to change its practices, and also if it insists on going forward with the new tariffs that it has recently announced.”
China’s Ministry of Commerce also issued a statement on Tuesday indicating that Beijing will fight back with “qualitative” and “quantitative” measures if the additional list of tariffs on Chinese goods becomes reality.
“Such a practice of extreme pressure and blackmailing deviates from the consensus reached by both sides on multiple occasions, and is a disappointment for the international community,” noted the ministry’s statement.
“The United States has initiated a trade war and violated market regulations and is harming the interests of not just the people of China and the U.S., but of the world,” the ministry said.

""While a seemingly minimal impact, as the domestic economy continues to struggle to maintain a near 2% growth rate, a loss of even a few tenths is an unwelcome impact.

911,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 15, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>",Argentine Peso Resumes Slide; Yield on Century Bonds Tops 9%,"(Bloomberg) -- The Argentine peso resumed its slide to a historic low as a major shakeup that put a former Wall Street trader at the helm of the nation’s central bank failed to curb the currency’s massive volatility.
Investors initially cheered the fact that Luis Caputo, who held roles at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), will take over the post following Federico Sturzenegger’s surprise resignation. All that enthusiasm sent the peso up more than 4 percent in the first hour of trading Friday, before a reality check kicked in -- sinking the currency to an all-time low. The yield on Argentina’s 100-year bond jumped to a record 9 percent.
Traders have been desperate for policy makers to lay out a strategy to curb the peso volatility, complaining that all they got in response was disjointed and unpredictable policy. Investors had expected that a $50 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund last week would return calm to the market. Instead, the peso collapse has added to the woes of a country already under siege from double-digit inflation and a ballooning current-account deficit.
The policy outlook for the Argentine peso remains challenging and the shakeup in central bank leadership doesn’t change that, said Erik Nelson, a currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in New York. “We would still expect Argentine peso weakness over time, but the question for us is how significant that weakness will be and whether the currency can eventually stabilize or recover,"" he said.
The peso dropped 1.4 percent to 28.10 per dollar Friday, leading losses among the world’s major currencies. The Merval gauge of stocks extended a four-day slide.
In May, officials sought to arrest the peso decline by jacking up interest rates to the highest in the world at 40 percent, intervening directly in the market and using a $5 billion offer at 25 pesos per dollar to contain the currency while the government negotiated the deal with the IMF. The day of the announcement, Sturzenegger said that the bank would only intervene in the market in ""disruptive situations."" Still, the central bank spent $794 million over two days to curb losses as volume plummeted.
The changes at the helm of the central bank, which included the departure of several high ranking officers, capped a dramatic day in local markets Thursday, with the peso plummeting and the monetary authority refraining from an intervention.
It’s ""rushed and sloppy"" to change the president of the central bank who signed an agreement with the IMF that hasn’t even started, according to a note by Perspectiv@s Economicas, a research firm led by Luis Secco, former cabinet chief at state-run Banco de la Nacion.
""In the next few days, we will know what the market reaction is and to what extent the problem was due to management by the central bank’s trading desk or if it’s a deeper problem that goes beyond individuals,"" the note said.
Caputo took the helm of the Finance Ministry in December 2016 after serving as a key figure in securing an agreement with investors holding debt the country defaulted on in 2001, a truce that allowed the country to return to global capital markets.
“The one person on Macri’s team they have confidence in is Toto Caputo,” said Walter Stoeppelwerth, the chief investment officer at Balanz Capital Valores in Buenos Aires. “Toto is a trader by nature. He’s going to have a clear trading plan. He’s somebody the market knows, in New York, in Buenos Aires... He’s somebody that people trust to make the right decisions, and who’s going to be decisive.""

916,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2018 12:07AM ET</span>",Euro on track for worst week in 19 months on ECB's cautious stance,"By Shinichi Saoshiro
TOKYO (Reuters) - The euro on Friday was headed for its worst weekly loss in 19 months after a cautious European Central Bank signaled it will keep interest rates at record lows well into next year.
Following a closely-watched meeting on Thursday, the ECB said it will end its massive bond purchase scheme by the end of this year, taking its biggest step towards dismantling crisis-era stimulus.
The euro briefly spiked to a one-month high of $1.1853 (EUR=) following the announcement.
But euro bulls were soon in retreat as the ECB also indicated that it would keep interest rates steady at least through the summer of 2019, reflecting the uncertainties hanging over the euro zone economy.
Euro bulls had been emboldened earlier this month as expectations grew for the ECB to begin raising rates at an earlier juncture in 2019, after comments by policymakers such as ECB chief economist Peter Praet, who struck a hawkish tone despite recent political troubles in Italy.
The single currency slumped nearly 1.9 percent on Thursday, its largest one-day fall since Britain's June 2016 Brexit vote shock.
It stretched overnight losses to brush $1.1555, lowest since May 30. The currency was down 1.72 percent on the week, positioning it to have its biggest weekly loss since November 2016.
""The euro showed such a big reaction to the ECB meeting as its stance came in sharp contrast to the Federal Reserve, which had struck a hawkish tone just the day before,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior forex strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
The Fed on Wednesday raised interest rates for the second time this year and indicated that it could tighten policy two more times in 2018.
""Instead of reacting immediately to the Fed, many in the market had opted to first see out the ECB meeting, considered the main event of the week. And they duly reacted,"" Ishikawa said.
The euro was a shade higher at 128.035 yen (EURJPY=) after dropping 1.7 percent overnight.
The dollar edged up 0.1 percent to 110.720 yen  after rising 0.25 percent the previous day.
The greenback was up roughly 1 percent versus its Japanese peer on the week, during which it brushed a three-week peak of 110.850 after the Fed's Wednesday policy announcement.
The currency pair, sensitive to shifts in risk appetite in the broader markets, could be impacted by developments later on Friday in the U.S.-China trade spat. 
U.S. President Donald Trump is due to unveil revisions to his initial tariff list targeting $50 billion of Chinese goods, and focus was on whether the revisions would ease or further fuel trade tensions.
""The tariff revision is a risk event the market is bracing for, with the United States potentially getting even more active on trade issues ahead of Mexico's elections in July,"" said Shusuke Yamada, currency and equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in Tokyo.
Mexico holds a presidential election on July 1 at a time when relations with its northern neighbor are frosty.
""The bottom line for currencies, however, is that the Fed is hawkish and the ECB is not, and monetary policy diversion remains the primary driver,"" Yamada said.
The yen's reaction to the Bank of Japan's decision to stand pat on monetary policy on Friday was limited, as such an outcome had been well anticipated.
The BOJ offered a weaker view on inflation than in April, signaling that it will be in no rush to dial back its massive stimulus program.
Against a broadly stronger dollar, the Australian dollar was down 0.25 percent at $0.7458 after slipping to a one-month trough of $0.7454 .

The dollar index gained about 0.2 percent to a two-week high of 94.995 (DXY), after rallying more than 1 percent on Thursday.

By contrast, the U.S. Federal Reserve struck a hawkish tone on Wednesday, raising interest rates for the second time this year by 25 basis points and hinting that it could raise rates twice more in 2018.

Meanwhile, U.S.-China trade tensions continued to escalate. U.S. President Donald Trump announced a decision to impose “pretty significant” tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods and will reveal the list on Friday.

918,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 10:00PM ET</span>",China's Yuan to Get Hit With $20 Billion Dividend Onslaught,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s currency has had a bumpier ride in the past several weeks than it’s seen since it stabilized against the dollar in 2017, and further turbulence may be in store as companies prepare to make a welter of dividend payments abroad.
Offshore-listed Chinese firms will hand out $19.6 billion of dividends in overseas currencies in the three months through August, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While some of the payments will be made from existing foreign-exchange holdings, some conversions from yuan will be needed, contributing to volatility, market players say.
After a long stretch of gains from 2017 to early 2018, the yuan lately has been confronting a resurgent dollar, thanks to rising U.S. Treasury yields. China’s currency dropped the most since 2016 last month, when its foreign-exchange reserves saw the first back-to-back drop in more than a year. On the flip side, depreciation has been limited by overseas investors’ increasing interest in Chinese securities, with net bond inflows the past 15 straight months.
""The yuan will likely weaken and become more volatile within a short period of time in the coming months due to the dividend payments,"" said Gao Qi, a currency strategist at Scotiabank in Singapore. ""That won’t lead to sustained depreciation or capital outflows -- the yuan will be supported as foreign investors keep adding Chinese bonds.""
Chinese companies’ dividend payments over the three months through August will be 23 percent greater than the same period last year, according to Bloomberg’s calculations based on exchange filings. Hong Kong-listed Chinese lenders are among the biggest payers. China Construction Bank Corp. will hand out $4.2 billion in August, when Bank of China Ltd. pays $2.1 billion, the filings show.
Analysts expect the yuan, which is still up 1.4 percent for 2018, to ride out the volatility and end the year at 6.4 per dollar, a Bloomberg survey shows. The currency slumped 0.27 percent to 6.4180 as of 9:37 a.m. in Shanghai.
""There will be a quick bout of depreciation pressures"" due to the dividend payouts, said Xiao Lisheng, a Beijing-based researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ""As soon as the round of declines are out of the way, companies will start to buy the yuan again, supporting the exchange rate.""

919,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 05:40PM ET</span>",Draghi Crushes the Euro -- and Everyone's Happy,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- European Central Bank President Mario Draghi pulled off a seemingly impossible task Thursday: He announced policy makers will phase out bond purchases by the end of this year without causing either the euro to soar or bonds and stocks to tumble. In fact, the opposite occurred, providing yet more evidence that efforts by the world's biggest central banks to unwind their quantitative easing measures might not be as disrupting to markets as first feared. 
The key for Draghi was that he also said the ECB will keep interest rates unchanged at record lows at least through mid-2019, a longer timeframe than investors anticipated. The Bloomberg Euro Index, which measures the currency against its major peers, promptly tumbled as much as 1.40 percent, the most since 2015. Germany, France, Spain and even Italy all saw their bonds rally, pushing yields lower. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index of equities surged the most in more than two months. “The reaction shows that the market had so far assumed that the end of QE would mean the start of a normalization process, which it is not,” Thu Lan Nguyen, a strategist at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG), said in emailed comments to Bloomberg News.
It would tough for the ECB to normalize policy at the same time it's cutting its forecasts following a spate of soft economic data out of the region recently. ECB staff now see the economy expanding just 2.1 percent this year, down from a prior forecast of 2.4 percent, before slowing to 1.9 percent in 2019 and 1.7 percent in 2020, according to new estimates released Thursday.
TOP DOLLARThe byproduct of a weaker euro is, of course, a stronger dollar, which brings its own implications. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index jumped as much as 0.98 percent, the most since January 2017, to a new high for the year. The greenback is also getting a boost from a more hawkish Federal Reserve, which on Wednesday signaled that it now expects to raise interest rates four times this year. Higher rates tend to attract capital from international investors, which helps to explain a rally in Treasuries Thursday that pushed 10-year Treasury yields further below the psychologically important 3 percent level. Two-year Treasuries now yield 3.20 percentage points more than similar-maturity German bunds, up from about 2 percentage points this time last year and the most since at least 1990. And while Europe's economy shows signs of slowing, the U.S. economy is picking up. The Commerce Department said Thursday that U.S. retail sales rose in May by the most in six months. Measures of gross domestic product suggest the economy is expanding at a greater than 4 percent annualized rate this quarter. “The U.S. is accelerating, and just about everyone else is decelerating,” Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit, told Bloomberg News. “There’s no question in my mind that the U.S. is leading the pack.”
U.S. STOCKS OUTPERFORMPerhaps the most visible sign of the economic divergence between the U.S. and the rest of the world is in the stock market. Yes, the S&P 500 Index had a great year in 2017, rising 19.4 percent, but that performance trailed the rest of the world as the MSCI All-Country World Index excluding the U.S. gained 24.06 percent. More recently, though, the tables have turned, with the S&P 500 gaining about 7.75 percent since early April compared with a decline of 0.60 percent for the rest of the world. While it's true that U.S. corporations are benefiting from tax-law changes, the International Monetary Fund warned on Thursday that tax cuts and public-spending hikes are increasing risks to the global economy by boosting debt, potentially stoking inflation and pushing the dollar higher. The loosening of the purse strings in Washington raises the risk of an “inflation surprise” for markets, the IMF said, according to Bloomberg News' Andrew Mayeda. And pricing pressures could in turn force the Fed to hike interest rates faster than expected. The IMF, which last week announced a record $50 billion loan program for Argentina, also said it’s seeing signs that U.S. fiscal policy may be causing capital flight from emerging markets.
MORE EMERGING-MARKET PAINEmerging-market equities and currencies took another hit on Thursday. The MSCI EM Index of stocks fell as much as 1.25 percent, while another MSCI gauge tracking their currencies tumbled to its lowest level since December. Emerging-market bonds have also been under pressure: The Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) index that tracks the dollar-denominated bonds of emerging-market borrowers has fallen 4.02 percent this year through Wednesday, the most among 19 major fixed-income markets tracked by Bloomberg. The Institute of International Finance in Washington estimates that more than $365 billion of EM government bonds and syndicated loans will come due in 2019, up from $185 billion this year and $160 billion in 2017. That means the more the dollar appreciates and U.S. rates rise, the more expensive it will be for emerging-market borrowers to refinance this debt. Argentina has been particularly troubled. Its peso tumbled to a new low on Thursday amid reports a group of central bank directors will depart from the institution, and as a truck drivers’ strike threatened to disrupt the country’s economy. The peso dropped as much as 5 percent on Thursday, bringing its decline for the year to more than 30 percent, the worst performance in emerging markets. Even more disturbing are signs that China's economy may be slowing, as recent data has fallen short of forecasts and its central bank chose not to follow the Fed in raising rates this week. 
COMMODITIES DIPGrowing concerns over China, the world's second-largest economy and one of the biggest consumers of raw materials, and emerging-markets in general help explain recent weakness in the commodities market. The Bloomberg Commodity Index fell as much as 0.99 percent Thursday to its lowest level since in seven weeks. It's safe to say that the declines have caught many commodity investors off guard. A monthly survey by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) released this week found that investor allocations to commodities is the highest in eight years. Some of the big losers in recent weeks in the commodities market include oil, gasoline, aluminum, corn and wheat. Oil has been under press amid signs that OPEC and its allies may agree to increase production when they meet in Vienna next week. It’s “inevitable” the cartel and its allies will decide to boost output gradually when they meet, Saudi Oil Minister Khalid Al-Falih said Thursday. Corn futures for December delivery fell as much as 3 percent to $3.85 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade on Thursday, the contract’s lowest level since Jan. 24. U.S. crop conditions have been “perfect” after planting, while trade tensions spurred negative sentiment, Ryan Fletcher, director of institutional sales at INTL FCStone in Chicago, told Bloomberg News.
TEA LEAVESIt's been a big week for central bankers, and it's not over. First, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell delivered a surprise by saying that he will start having a press conference after each Federal Open Market Committee meeting starting in January. Then, the ECB's Draghi Mario Draghi said the euro-area economy is strong enough that it can phase out bond purchases by the end of the year. So, will Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda make it three-for-three by signaling something new when he and his colleagues wrap up their monetary policy meeting in a few hours? The chances are slim. Bloomberg Intelligence economist Yuki Masujima expects little fireworks, with the BOJ likely leaving its accommodative policy settings unchanged, including holding its key rate at negative 0.1 percent, in an effort to spur inflation, which remains far below the central bank's 2 percent target. ""The economy has sent a mix of mildly positive and negative signals since the last board meeting in late April, but nothing that alters the picture of steady, if slow, progress on reflation,"" Masujima wrote in a research note.

Emerging-market assets extended losses a day after the Federal Reserve’s more hawkish signals.
A measure of currencies in developing nations dropped to a seven-month low, while every group in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell -- led by industrial, commodity and technology companies. The Argentine peso sank more than 6 percent on reports of changes at the country’s central bank and after truck drivers began a strike. The Brazilian real -- dropped a fourth day as the impact of a massive sale of foreign-exchange swaps was short lived.
Developing-nation assets took a beating as signals of a slightly more aggressive pace of Fed hikes added to concern over further currency depreciation in developing economies. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank said a rate increase won’t come until the summer of 2019, though it announced it would end stimulus in December, setting the euro area up for an exit from years of massive monetary support.

921,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 03:41PM ET</span>",Dollar Bulls Get Fresh Ammo From Draghi-Powell Double Whammy,"(Bloomberg) -- Currency traders looking to Jerome Powell and Mario Draghi for direction are getting the clearest signals yet that the dollar is set to extend its gains versus the euro.
That bet is being fueled by a divergence between the Federal Reserve chairman’s hawkish stance Wednesday and the European Central Bank president’s dovish posture Thursday. The disparate policy paths and contrasting fundamental trends in the U.S. and Europe are setting up a test of the key $1.15 level for the euro-dollar exchange rate in the weeks ahead, according to strategists at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) & Co. and ABN Amro Group NV.
The greenback has “a little room to run” still, said Kathy Jones, New York-based chief fixed-income strategist at Charles Schwab. “We have seen softer numbers out of Europe and firmer numbers out of the U.S.”
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose as much as 0.7 percent Thursday to its highest since November after the ECB pledged to keep interest rates unchanged at current record lows at least through the summer of 2019, even as it phases out bond purchases by the end of the year. The move comes a day after the Fed raised interest rates, ratcheted up rate projections for 2018 and 2019 and sounded an optimistic note on the U.S. economy. The greenback has risen 2 percent this year, rebounding after an almost 9 percent loss in 2017.
Here’s what others had to say about the euro-dollar outlook:
"
922,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>","As Argentine Peso Craters, Stock Pickers Pin Hope on Upgrade","(Bloomberg) -- Argentine stock investors battered by a currency collapse may be on the cusp of some relief as MSCI Inc. considers an upgrade to emerging-market status.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) says the benchmark equity index could jump 20 percent if the classification is raised in a decision set to be announced June 20, or sink 5 percent if it’s left as a lower-grade frontier market. Funds with $1 trillion in assets follow MSCI’s indexes, and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). says an upgrade would bring $3.8 billion of inflows to the local stock market.
A boost in status would reward President Mauricio Macri for his efforts to normalize the economy since he took over in 2015, and couldn’t come at a better time for Argentine investors after a peso rout that’s created one of the world’s worst performing stock markets in dollar terms during the past three months.
But investors are concerned that the market turmoil -- which prompted Argentina to take out a $50 billion credit line from the International Monetary Fund this month -- could be a reason for MSCI to maintain the frontier status, a designation the nation has held since 2009 following a downgrade that stemmed from capital controls.
“All the different things that the government has been doing since the election of President Macri are consistent with Argentina being back in the emerging markets category,” said Gerardo Rodriguez, who manages about $600 million of assets at BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). but won’t touch Argentine stocks because of their lowly classification. “On the other hand, you have the recent volatility and concerns from a macro perspective. In the medium term I’m sure it will happen. Short term, not so sure.”
Argentine investors went through this drama a year ago, when analysts at half a dozen Wall Street banks predicted an upgrade on the heels of Macri policies including allowing the peso to float freely, removing a rule that established a minimum period for portfolio flows to remain in the country and ending the need for central bank approval to repatriate funds. MSCI ultimately kept Argentina’s frontier designation, saying it needed to assess “the irreversibility” of changes that improved access to the market.
This year, only a handful of analysts have said they expect an upgrade, and they often added caveats. An investor survey by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) last week found that while 58 percent of participants thought Argentina deserved an upgrade, only 38 percent think it will actually get one.
During the past year, the stock exchange implemented the remaining items in MSCI’s emerging-market criteria, such as implementing short selling of stocks. Still, officials have lots of leeway to decide whether to elevate the status to the level of Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and Russia, or keep it with countries such as Bahrain, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Slovenia.
Sebastien Lieblich, a managing director at MSCI, said in a May interview that Argentina has shown its commitment to avoiding capital controls, and that boded well for an upgrade. But officials will also consider investor sentiment, and volatility has “raised questions.” The peso has tumbled 33 percent this year, reaching a record Thursday at 27.7 per dollar.
The benchmark Merval index has slumped 32 percent this year in dollar terms following a two-year, 80 percent surge. The main drag has been investor concern about fiscal accounts, inflation and central bank independence, which helped make the peso the worst-performing major currency this year. Officials have sought to arrest the decline by jacking up interest rates, intervening directly in the market and taking out the IMF credit line.
Optimists say mid-term elections last year showed broad support for Macri’s policies and should bolster confidence that his economic reforms will stay in place. But if Argentina is passed over once again, MSCI may wait to see the results of presidential elections in October 2019 before considering an upgrade again, according to Morgan Stanley. That means another chance at emerging-market status may not appear until 2020.
A positive decision this year “should be a walk in the park -- there’s no reason why Argentina wouldn’t be upgraded,” said Oliver Bell, a money manager who oversees $500 million of assets at T. Rowe Price Group Inc., including Argentine stocks. But after the volatility, “one wonders if it gives MSCI an excuse to delay it again.”

The bank's unexpectedly dovish guidance on interest rates overshadowed its statement that it aimed to wrap up its crisis-era stimulus program, quantitative easing, at the end of this year.
The ECB now plans to reduce monthly asset purchases between October and December to 15 billion euros until the end of 2018 and then conclude the program, though ECB President Mario Draghi stressed that the governing council stood ready ""to adjust all its instruments as appropriate.""
Investors, though, seized on comments indicating that interest rates would stay at record lows at least through the summer of 2019. 
Some analysts believe it could be even longer.
""With Draghi's term of office due to expire at the end of October 2019, we feel the ECB is unlikely to start increasing interest rates until the new ECB president is firmly in place,"" said David Zahn, head of European fixed income for Franklin Templeton.
Ten-year government bond yields in Germany, the euro zone benchmark, fell around four basis points to 0.43 percent (DE10YT=RR).
The euro, meanwhile, touched on its steepest one-day drop against the U.S. dollar since June of 2016, while the dollar accelerated to a two-week peak.
The euro (EUR=) was last down 1.37 percent to $1.1628, while the dollar index, which measures the greenback against six top currencies, (DXY) rose 0.85 percent.
EQUITIES STRONG
European equities rose sharply after initial losses, with Wall Street creeping into positive territory. 
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index (FTEU3) rose 1.40 percent, buoyed by big gains in interest rate-sensitive sectors like autos and utilities.
""The hawks had been guiding for a June hike before the (ECB) meeting and, given the clear guidance the ECB gave today on interest rates, it had to be priced out,"" said AFS Group analyst Arne Petimezas. ""It doesn't seem like we're at the stage where the hawks are on top of things."" 
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (MIWD00000PUS) shed 0.05 percent, while Wall Street wavered, with two of the three main indexes up after better-than-expected May retail sales data.
The U.S. Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose 0.8 percent last month, the biggest advance since November 2017. Data for April was also revised upward.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 7.94 points, or 0.03 percent, to 25,193.26, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 7.6 points, or 0.27 percent, to 2,783.23 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 62.69 points, or 0.81 percent, to 7,758.39.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) closed 1.11 percent lower, while Japan's Nikkei (N225) lost 0.99 percent.
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes (US10YT=RR) last rose 8/32 in price to yield 2.9516 percent, from 2.979 percent late on Wednesday.
The 30-year bond (US30YT=RR) last rose 21/32 in price to yield 3.0696 percent, from 3.102 percent Wednesday.
TRADE TENSIONS
One issue keeping investors in check was concern about U.S. threats to impose tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods. U.S. President Donald Trump was planning to meet with trade advisers later to decide whether to activate the tariffs, a senior administration official said on Wednesday. 
CBOT corn and soybean futures were down sharply as uncertainty about tariffs and favorable crop weather in the U.S. Midwest have prompted funds to liquidate big long positions.
CBOT July corn <1CN8> fell to its lowest since mid-January and front-month soybeans  dipped to a 9-1/2 month low. Traders are worries about China, Mexico and other countries curbing demand for U.S. grain and soy exports.
Another event markets were gearing up for: the start of soccer's World Cup in Russia, where time zone differences mean there will be more matches during European or U.S. and Latin American trading hours than any previous tournament.
A study done during the last World Cup with similarly-timed games, the 2010 finals in South Africa, showed trading volumes on share markets dropped by a third on average when matches were on and 55 percent when a market's own team played.
Oil prices were down, facing pressure from evidence of rising U.S. output and uncertainty over supply, before a meeting next week of the world's largest exporters.

U.S. crude  fell 0.3 percent to $66.44 per barrel and Brent  was last at $75.95, down 1.03 percent on the day.

925,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 09:58AM ET</span>",Euro falls one percent versus dollar and bond yields tumble on dovish ECB interest rate guidance,"By Dhara Ranasinghe and Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone bond yields tumbled and the euro headed for its biggest daily loss versus the dollar in eight months on Thursday after the European Central Bank indicated it would not be raising interest rates through the summer of 2019.
The bank's unexpectedly dovish guidance on interest rates overshadowed, at least for the time being, its statement that it aimed to wrap up its stimulus program at the end of this year -- marking the biggest step in dismantling crisis-era stimulus -- quantitative easing.
The ECB now plans to reduce monthly asset purchases between October and December to 15 billion euros until the end of 2018 and then conclude the program, though ECB President Mario Draghi stressed that the governing council stood ready ""to adjust all its instruments as appropriate"".
However, investors seized on comments indicating that the end of QE would not be followed by rapid policy tightening, and that interest rates would stay at record lows at least through the summer of 2019. 
Some market players now reckon rates may not rise even in the months immediately after next summer, noting that Draghi's tenure at the ECB would end in October 2019.
""Although we now know that QE is scheduled to end under Draghi’s watch, we think the ECB could wait a little longer before starting to raise interest rates,"" said David Zahn, head of European fixed income for Franklin Templeton. 
""With Draghi's term of office due to expire at the end of October 2019, we feel the ECB is unlikely to start increasing interest rates until the new ECB president is firmly in place.""
The single currency (EUR=EBS) is currently on track for its biggest one-day loss since October against the dollar, while it also fell one percent to the yen and half a percent to the Swiss franc (EURJPY=) (EURCHF=EBS). 
Bond investors, meanwhile, drew comfort from the dovish interest rate outlook, with 10-year government bond yields in Germany, the euro zone benchmark, falling around four basis points to 0.44 percent (DE10YT=RR).
Analysts also noted that there were no changes to the ECB's plan to reinvest funds from maturing bonds, providing a layer of support for bonds markets even as the central bank winds down QE. 
ECONOMIC GROWTH 
Bond yields from Italy, the country seen as the most vulnerable to higher borrowing costs, also fell, with short-dated yields down 7 basis points at 0.89 percent (IT2YT=RR), having been 9 bps higher shortly before the ECB statement.
Italian 10-year yields were down around 2 bps at 2.80 percent (IT10YT=RR).
Draghi noted that volatility in Italy had ebbed in the past two weeks but revised down economic growth forecasts for the euro zone for 2018, while noting that inflation, after accounting for higher oil prices, remained muted
Karen Ward, chief market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management, said the move to end QE by end-year as previously signaled was significant in light of the recent Italian mini-crisis that saw bond yields there soar to multi-year highs.
""Stepping back from QE will insulate the ECB from potential criticism that it is funding the fiscal largesse associated with certain populist policies.""
But the ECB stance has surprised markets, partly because ECB policymakers such as chief economist Peter Praet, have in recent weeks indicated the central bank remained undeterred by events Italy or economic data indicating a slowdown in euro zone growth momentum. 
""The hawks had been guiding for a June hike before the meeting and given the clear guidance the ECB gave today on interest rates, it had to be priced out,"" said Arne Petimezas, an analyst at AFS Group, an Amsterdam-based brokerage.
Money market pricing accordingly reflected a scaling ack of rate-hike bets over the next year.
Investors now price less than a 30 percent chance of a 10 basis point rate hike in June 2019, compared with a roughly 80 percent chance before the ECB announcement .
On equity markets, an index of euro zone stocks - which benefit from a weaker euro - jumped 0.8 percent (STOXXE) to a 2 1/2 week high, having languished in negative territory before the announcement. 
The biggest beneficiaries were interest-rate sensitive sectors such as autos (SXAP) which rose 1.8 percent, while shares in utilities rose 0.6 percent (SX86P).
Bank stocks, which tend to gain from higher interest rates, fell 0.5 percent on the day (SX7E) but JPM's Ward played down that move. 
""If low interest rates support the health of the economy – not least via a weaker exchange rate – then that will help demand for lending and volume bank lending,"" she said.

926,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 09:15AM ET</span>",Forex - Euro Drops as ECB to End QE But Keep Interest Rates on Hold,"Investing.com - The euro dropped on Thursday after the European Central Bank signaled plans to wind up its bond purchasing program stimulus program by the end of the year but reiterated that it expects to keep interest rates on hold until the middle of 2019.
The euro initially spiked to the days highs, with EUR/USD rising to 1.1852, the most since May 16, before reversing gains to trade at 1.1667 by 09:19 AM ET (13:19 GMT).
The ECB said that it anticipates its asset purchase program will end in December 2018 after halving to €15 billion per month from September 2018, down from €30 billion at present.
The euro came under pressure after the ECB also pledged to keep interest rates unchanged until at least the middle of next year.
""The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remains aligned with the current expectations of a sustained adjustment path,"" the ECB said.
The single currency came under additional selling pressure after ECB President Mario Draghi reiterated that the central bank stands ready to ramp up stimulus as needed.
Economic growth in the euro zone economy is solid, Draghi said but he noted that it has moderated due to temporary factors, such as weaker trade and pointed to rising protectionism as a particular risk.
The ECB cut its forecast for growth this year, saying it now expects euro zone GDP to increase by 2.1%, down from 2.4% in March.
It raised its inflation forecast for this year, saying it now expects consumer prices to rise by 1.7%, up from 1.4% previously.
The euro was also lower against the yen and the pound, with EUR/JPY losing 0.95% to trade at 128.92 and EUR/GBP down 0.49% to 0.8773.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, rose 0.67% to 94.19, the most since June 5, boosted by the weaker euro.
The ECB announcement came a day after a more hawkish sounding Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the second time this year and indicated that it now sees two more rate increases before the years end.
The Fed described the U.S. jobs market as “strong” and said economic activity had been rising at “a solid rate”."

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro slumped more than half a percent on Thursday after the European Central Bank said it would keep interest rates at record lows through the summer of 2019 and signaled it would end its unprecedented bond purchase scheme by end-2018.
After initially rallying nearly half a percent higher to $1.1853, the single currency (EUR=EBS) fell to the day's lows at $1.1718 -- marking an intraday range of one percent as some analysts were disappointed about the timing of its rate hike.
Investors now price just a 30 percent chance of a 10 basis point rate hike by July 2019, compared with a roughly 80 percent chance earlier in the day. 
""The hawks had been guiding for a June hike before the meeting and given the clear guidance the ECB gave today on interest rates, it had to be priced out,"" said AFS Group analyst Arne Petimezas based in Amsterdam. 
Signaling the move would not mean rapid policy tightening in the coming months, the ECB also said that interest rates would stay at record lows at least through the summer of 2019, suggesting protracted support for the economy, even if at a lower level. 
""It doesn't seem like we're at the stage where the hawks are on top of things."" 
The euro's drop pulled the dollar higher with the index up 0.1 percent on the day (DXY) at 93.81.
In the London session, the dollar was trading broadly weaker before the ECB decision in the wake of the Fed's rate hikes, with future rate rises now priced in with a growing view that U.S. economic strength could be nearing its peak, analysts said. 

As expected, the Fed lifted its key overnight borrowing costs by a quarter percentage point for a second time this year, to between 1.75 and 2.00 percent.

The rate hike announced in the U.S. was the second this year after a first hike in March. The Fed hiked rates by 25 basis points to a range of 1.75% to 2% and hinted at two more rate hikes later in the year, instead of just one it had previously suggested. Investors took both the hike and the announcement as a sign of strong confidence in the U.S. economy despite uncertainty cast by trade tensions between the U.S. and many of its partners, including China and other G7 members.
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields were also supported by the Fed's move, rising to 2.992% overnight before paring gains. 
In the wake of an upbeat summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, investors appeared to be shifting their focus to simmering U.S.-China trade tensions.

931,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 13, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>",Trump Says He May Upset China on Trade as U.S. Tariffs Loom,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he’ll confront China “very strongly” over trade in the coming weeks, as his administration prepares to follow through on a threat to slap tariffs on Chinese imports.
“China could be a little bit upset about trade because we are very strongly clamping down on trade,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News’s Bret Baier airing on Wednesday. The interview was conducted Tuesday aboard Air Force One after Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Trump has convened a meeting at the White House on Thursday to talk with his trade team about whether to move forward with tariffs on Chinese goods, according to two people familiar with the plans.
“You will see over the next couple of weeks. They understand what we are doing,” he said before praising his “good” personal relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
The White House has said it’s proceeding with plans to impose duties on $50 billion of Chinese goods, after weeks of high level-discussions between the U.S. and China yielded little progress over a trade deal.
The Trump administration plans to announce on Friday a final list of tariff targets, which will will be imposed “shortly thereafter.” The Trump administration is reviewing a flood of comments to refine its initial list of $50 billion in imports that it revealed in April.
In its preliminary list, the U.S. said it would levy an additional 25 percent duty on everything from TV components to dishwashers and snowblowers.
Trump Decision
Administration officials have cautioned that Trump has the final say.
“It’s always the president’s decision,” White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said Tuesday at an event in Washington.
The administration is expected to put the Chinese tariffs into effect by next month, said Ted Murphy, managing partner at the Washington office of law firm Baker McKenzie.
“That would be my baseline case: that they’re going to publish a final list on Friday with an effective date of July 1,” said Murphy, who sits on a trade committee that advises the Commerce Department and U.S. Trade Representative’s office. “Things change on a tweet, so if they think China is negotiating in good faith, they could delay it.”
China has threatened to retaliate with proportional duties on everything from American soybeans to airplanes. The two countries have been trying to negotiate a truce to the trade spat. But at the latest round of talks in Beijing, Xi’s government warned that will withdraw any commitments if Trump carries out his threat to impose duties.
North Korea Meeting
Trump’s warning comes just days after his meeting in Singapore with Kim over that nation’s nuclear weapons. China is a key player in talks to wind down North Korea’s nuclear program and bring peace to the Korean Peninsula.
China is widely seen as one of the big winners of Trump’s meeting with Kim as it hopes to maintain stability in its neighboring country and boost trade.
Trump on Tuesday thanked China for tightening its sanctions on trade with North Korea, arguing that the economic pressure along North Korea’s northwest border had helped bring Kim to the negotiating table.
G-7 Tussle
The tariffs move would come against the backdrop of heightened tensions between America and its traditional trading and security partners.
A meeting of the Group of Seven ended in chaos this weekend, after Trump revoked support for a joint statement and lashed out at fellow leaders. Following the meetings, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde warned that the outlook for the global economy is growing “darker by the day.”
Businesses are lobbying to shape the final U.S. list, with many firms pushing for exclusions for products they use in their supply chains. Almost 125 companies testified in Washington during three days of hearings last month to collect feedback over the tariffs. Many warned that the tariffs would increase their costs and raise prices for consumers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar was weaker against the euro but rose against some emerging market currencies and hit a three-week high against the yen on Wednesday as investors braced for what is expected to be the Federal Reserve's second interest rate increase of 2018.
The euro gained ground on the greenback amid expectations that the European Central Bank on Thursday would signal its intention to taper its 2.55 trillion euro ($3 trillion) bond purchasing program later in 2018.
Some emerging market currencies weakened versus the dollar on the possibility of a Fed rate hike, while others rose. Countries like Turkey  with large external financing needs are particularly vulnerable to rising dollar-funding costs.
The U.S. central bank is due to release its latest policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), followed by a press conference half an hour later by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.
The Fed is expected to raise its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 1.75 percent to 2.00 percent. Investors will scour the statement for clues as to whether the Fed will raise rates once or twice more in the second half of 2018. 
""If they paint a picture of stronger inflation and growth, the market would take that as dollar-positive,"" said Richard Scalone, co-head of foreign exchange at TJM Brokerage in Chicago.
At 10:17 a.m. (1417 GMT), the dollar was flat at 110.39 yen  after earlier hitting a three-week high at 110.71 yen.
The euro was up 0.25 percent at $1.1770 (EUR=) and was 0.36 percent stronger at 129.96 yen (EURJPY=).
Among emerging market currencies, the Turkish lira  was down 1 percent at 4.646 lira per dollar, while South Africa's rand  firmed 0.2 percent to 13.300 rand per dollar.
The British pound dipped to a one-week low of $1.3309 , unable to hold gains made on Tuesday when it briefly rose to $1.3424 after British Prime Minister Theresa May saw off a parliamentary rebellion over amendments to a bill for the country's exit from the European Union next year.
Slower-than-expected British inflation data on Wednesday also hurt the pound, as it weakened the case for a Bank of England rate rise in August.
The Canadian dollar, which has fallen heavily in recent weeks on concerns an escalating trade dispute with the United States would hit Canada's economy hard, rebounded nearly 0.2 percent to C$1.2992 , above what was nearly a three-month low of C$1.3068 set last week.
The Norwegian crown rallied for a second straight session against the dollar  and the euro (EURNOK=), hitting its strongest level against the single currency since late October after an upbeat central bank survey raised expectations of tighter monetary policy.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.20% to 93.64 by 10:25 AM ET (14:25 GMT).
The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates for the second time this year at its meeting and with a rate hike almost fully priced in market participants will be focusing on whether the central banks plans to speed up the pace of rate hikes this year.
Data earlier Wednesday pointing to an increase in producer prices last month underlined expectations that inflation will continue to pick up this year, a day after a report showing a moderate increase in consumer prices in May.
The euro pushed higher against the dollar, with EUR/USD rising 0.23% to 1.1771 as traders looked ahead to Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting amid speculation that the bank could signal its intention to start unwinding its bond purchasing program.
The dollar was little changed against the yen, with USD/JPY last at 110.39 after rising to a three week high of 110.72 earlier.
The pound was a touch lower against the U.S. currency, with GBP/USD sliding to 1.3361 after data showing that UK inflation remained steady at a one-year low on May, despite pressure from higher oil prices.
The disappointing inflation data weakened the case for a rate hike by the Bank of England in August.
In emerging markets, the dollar was higher against the Turkish lira and lower against the South African rand ahead of the looming Fed hike."
935,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 13, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",These Three Emerging-Market Currencies Look Weakest Before Fed,"(Bloomberg) -- Traders have put three emerging-market currencies on notice amid speculation a more hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve alongside a widely anticipated rate increase Wednesday could propel the dollar higher.
Signals from currency derivatives and credit-default swaps show that while stress is building up across many developing nations, the South African rand, Brazilian real and Turkish lira are the most vulnerable.
Further currency depreciation across emerging markets would exacerbate strains on central banks facing a trader onslaught against countries with widening current-account deficits, accelerating inflation and rising political risk.
The MSCI emerging market currency index is on course for a third successive monthly decline for the first time since January 2016.
Risk Reversals
Risk reversals show that, of the 24 most-traded emerging-market currencies, the rand is least loved by options traders, followed closely by the lira.
Implied Carry
The expected interest-rate arbitrage over the next month is falling for many currencies as higher U.S. interest rates narrow yield premiums. That’s not all. Surging volatility is narrowing returns when the carry trade is adjusted for currency swings. While that’s led to the deepest reduction in carry potential this month for Colombia’s peso, the lira, rand and real are next.
Debt Risk
Five-year credit default swaps show debt risk is rising fastest in Brazil, though the deterioration in South Africa is almost as stark. The rising cost of insuring government debt may mean more pressure on currencies.
None of this implies a Fed rate increase will automatically trigger losses. The MSCI gauge for emerging-market currencies has already lost 3.6 percent since its peak in early April. That might suggest to some traders that the Fed’s stance is already factored into prices, and in the absence any surprises, the currencies will hold their own.

GBP/USD hit lows of 1.1312 after the release of the data and was trading at 1.3319 by 05:19 AM ET (09:19 AM GMT).
The Office for National Statistics reported that the annual rate of inflation rose by 2.4% in May, unchanged from the previous month, which was a one year low and in line with expectations.
Rising motor fuel prices produced the largest upward contribution to inflation, the ONS said, reflecting increases in crude oil prices.
Underlying inflation rose by 2.1% on a year-over-year basis, matching the previous month and also in line with forecasts.
Inflation remains below wage growth, even after data on Tuesday showing that wage growth slowed slightly in the three months to April.
The steep drop in sterling in the wake of the June 2017 Brexit referendum drove up the cost of imports, leading to a spike in inflation. Although it has pulled back from its November peak of 3.1%, it is still running above the BoE’s target of 2.0%.
With inflation falling back towards the BoE’s target and economic and wage growth cooling markets are taking the view that a rate hike by the BoE in the coming months is becoming increasingly less likely.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report for the week ended June 8 at 10:30AM ET (1430GMT), amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of 1.4 million barrels.
Analysts also forecast a gain of 443,000 barrels for gasoline stockpiles, while distillate inventories are expected to rise by 200,000 barrels.
The data will also offer fresh indications on how fast domestic output levels continue to rise. U.S. crude production - driven by shale extraction - is currently at an all-time high of 10.8 million barrels per day (bpd).
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories increased by 833,000 barrels last week.
The API data also showed a rise of nearly 2.3 million barrels in gasoline stockpiles, while inventories of distillates climbed by 2.1 million barrels.
There are often sharp divergences between the API estimates and the official figures from EIA.
U.S. benchmark oil, July West Texas Intermediate WTI crude was down 44 cents, or roughly 0.7%, at $65.92 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange by 3:50AM ET (0750GMT).
Elsewhere, August Brent crude, the global benchmark, shed 49 cents, or around 0.7%, to $75.39 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.
Meanwhile, oil traders continued to weigh potential outcomes for a meeting of major oil producers later this month.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is due to meet at its headquarters in Vienna, together with non-OPEC member Russia, on June 22 to discuss production policy.
OPEC and non-OPEC producers have been curbing output by about 1.8 million bpd to prop up oil prices and reduce high global oil stocks. The pact began in January 2017 and is set to expire at the end of 2018.
However, Saudi Arabia and Russia have said cuts could be eased after receiving calls from consumers including the United States, China and India to support global demand in reaction to lost supplies out of Venezuela and Iran.

941,By Business Insider,"<span>Jun 12, 2018 09:59AM ET</span>",The dollar is the 'collateral damage' of Trump's foreign policy,"The US dollar has rallied about 4% in recent months, and investor sentiment for the currency is the strongest in years. But some analysts say that's all about to change as President Donald Trump ratchets up tensions between the US and its closest allies.
Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC), head of North American FX strategy at TD Securities, said in a research note out Monday the rally looks likely to roll over amid the return of the ""Trump discount.""
""The dollar is merely collateral damage to Trump's stressing of the global orthodoxy,"" McCormick said. ""Geopolitical uncertainty is here to stay. The consequence is the market will be plagued by more volatility and bigger drawdowns, especially in the highbeta space.""
Trump over the weekend refused to sign a joint statement with the US's closest allies following the Group of Seven summit in Quebec, which he left a day early to meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. And it was just the latest in a string of breaks from diplomatic norms that the president has led since taking office. 
McCormick thinks this approach could create a ""feedback loop"" of sorts. The US needs an injection of foreign capital to fund its twin deficits at a time when assets might start to build a larger risk premium, he said. 
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate, which generally pushes the currency higher, but the effect could be softer than usual amid geopolitical tensions.
""For once, the Fed is more likely a sideshow than a primary driver in the FX markets this week,"" McCormick said. 
On the other hand, some see the president's approach to foreign policy as an opportunity for a stronger dollar. Jameel Ahmed, head of currency and market strategy at FXTM, said hope for successful US-North Korea negotiations could bolster the greenback.
""For all of the unpredictable moments that have occurred since Trump became President of the United States, the news that he would have a summit with Kim Jong-un is perhaps the most significant,"" he said. ""The USD could even catch a bid and move higher on optimism that Trump’s foreign policy tactics could encourage world peace."""

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar gave up all its earlier gains on Tuesday, as markets saw few concrete measures emerging from the U.S.-North Korea summit and waited for guidance from two of the world's top central banks this week.
With most currencies staying within well-trodden trading ranges before U.S. inflation data due shortly, the Norwegian kroner was the surprise winner in the London session as a survey by Norway's central bank painted a rosy outlook for the economy. 
""There is very little to take away from the summit and the markets will be focused on the Fed's forward guidance,"" said Manuel Oliveri, an FX strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London.
U.S. inflation data for May is expected to show a modest rise in price pressures, with the headline rate tipped to rise to 2.7 percent on an annual basis, according to a Reuters poll, versus 2.5 percent previously. The data is due at 1230 GMT.
Against a basket of rivals (DXY), the dollar was flat on the day at 93.60 after bouncing 0.3 percent to 93.89 in early trading in Asia, its highest since June 5. 
U.S. President Donald Trump said he had formed a ""very special bond"" with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at a meeting, but the Korean stock and currency markets were broadly flat and U.S. debt, which tends to benefit from geopolitical uncertainty, held steady.
""This is more of a side show and headline grabber rather than yielding anything substantive with markets more worried about the developments at the G7 summit,"" said Viraj Patel, a currency strategist at ING in London, referring to trade tensions among the world's largest economies. 
Against the Japanese yen , the dollar was trading a quarter of a percent higher at 110.32 yen, its highest in nearly three weeks and above a 200-day moving average. 
SHINING CROWN
The Norwegian crown jumped after a central bank survey indicated Norwegian companies are expecting the pace of output growth to accelerate in the next half year, painting a relatively robust outlook for the domestic economy.
Norges Bank's regional network business survey, a key component in rate decisions and interest rate forecasts is followed by a central bank meeting next week.
The crown (EURNOK=D3) strengthened against the euro to a seven-month high of 9.4272, up 0.4 percent on the day.
Currency markets had a slightly more risk-on mode with perceived safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc  weaker on the day, while relatively high yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar  posting modest gains.
Of more importance to global markets will be any clarity on the outlook for U.S. and European monetary policy this week at a time when policymakers have stuck to optimistic stances despite the tensions over global trade.
The U.S. Federal Reserve holds a two-day meeting starting on June 12, and it is widely expected to raise interest rates for the second time this year. The focus is on whether the central bank will hint at raising rates a total of four times in 2018.
The European Central Bank also meets on June 14, when it could signal intentions to start unwinding its massive bond purchasing program.

Against the dollar, the euro was flat on the day at $1.1784 (EUR=EBS).

The currency fell 2.7 percent to 26.00 per dollar in Buenos Aires from 25.31 per dollar Friday. It was the second straight day of losses for the peso since Argentina’s government announced that it will receive a $50 billion credit line from the International Monetary Fund, the largest deal in the Fund’s history.
Argentina’s central bank stopped defending the peso Friday, allowing it to surpass 25 per dollar. After weeks of volatility, it had been defending the peso since May 14 by offering to sell $5 billion at 25 pesos to the dollar. The trade was never executed but kept the currency below that threshold. Now the peso is weakening, despite the wide appraisal by economists and analysts about the robust IMF agreement that’s meant to damp investors’ concern about Argentina’s deficits and debt load.
Emerging market currencies, from Mexico to South Africa to Turkey, weakened Monday. Economists say the lack of central bank intervention, broad pressure on the asset class and longstanding concern about Argentina’s fiscal deficit pushed the peso down.

""I think that the super-sized IMF package is not settling to markets,"" says David Tawil, president of Maglan Capital which invests in Argentine debt.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro rose to a near two-week high on Monday after assurances from Italy that it would not leave the European Union calmed investors' nerves before a key European Central Bank (ECB) policy meeting.
Italy's economy minister said on Sunday his new coalition government would not leave the euro or issue securities to pay off companies owed money by the state, a plan investors viewed as a first step toward exiting the bloc. 
That sent Italian borrowing costs down sharply on Monday as the euro rallied half a percent to $1.1816 (EUR=EBS) toward a two-week high of $1.1840 touched on Thursday.
""The Italy comments calmed fears but let's wait for the government's policy actions this summer. That will decide the market's direction,"" said MUFG currency strategist Lee Hardman.
Investors are raising their bets that the ECB will signal at a policy meeting on Thursday a winding down of its vast bond-buying program by the end of 2018, following a flurry of hawkish comments by officials last week.
The euro bounced despite heightened worries about a global trade war following a spat at the Group of Seven summit in Canada between U.S. President Donald Trump and other leaders over automobile tariffs and other issues. 
Trumped lashed out at Canada and Europe over the U.S. trade deficit after he arrived in Singapore, where he is due to hold an historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Tuesday. 
The Mexican peso and Canadian dollar, which has been dogged by fears that Trump may scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), both fell 0.6 percent.  
Analysts said that the fairly muted reaction in currencies reflected the low expectations markets had for the G7 summit, despite the fact that the euro is sensitive to the threat of U.S. tariffs on cars.
""The overhang of global trade wars is still very much alive but the global FX price action this week will be driven by a stream of other key events,"" said Viraj Patel, a currencies analyst at ING. 
Investors are ready for more volatility before a confluence of big events this week, including the Trump-Kim summit, policy reviews by the world's three major central banks, and a UK parliamentary Brexit bill vote. (For a Factbox, see)
Easing Italian political concerns and speculation the ECB will announce on June 14 when it will unwind its bond purchasing program put the dollar under pressure last week as the euro bounced back from 10-month lows.
Before the ECB meeting, the U.S. Federal Reserve is almost unanimously expected to raise interest rates for the second time this year on Wednesday. The market's focus will be on the Fed's projection on the path of future interest rates.

The Sovereign Money initiative was rejected by more than three quarters of voters in a referendum on Sunday.
The Swiss National Bank had opposed the initiative, which would have made it the only authority allowed to create new money in Switzerland, saying it would limit its ability to conduct monetary policy.
Analysts had argued an acceptance of the initiative could have triggered renewed upward pressure on the franc as speculators bet against the SNB's weakened ability to intervene in the currency markets.
The SNB acknowledged the result, saying adoption of the initiative would have made it much harder to control inflation in Switzerland.
""With conditions now remaining unchanged, the SNB will be able to maintain its monetary policy focus on ensuring price stability, which makes an important contribution to our country's prosperity,"" it said in a statement on Sunday.
At 0550 GMT, the franc was trading at 1.1621 to the euro.

Investors are looking ahead to the Trump-Kim meeting later this week and policy reviews by the world’s three major central banks.

The USD/JPY pair gained 0.18% to 109.75 by 12:00PM ET (04:00 GMT). However, the market reaction was considered moderate since few traders had expected a meaningful agreement on trade to be reached at the G7.
Additionally, central banks in the U.S., the euro zone and Japan will hold their policy reviews later this week. With the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates at the meeting this week, investors are focusing on whether there will be a third and fourth hike in 2018.

Traders will be watching for signs of what kind of Brexit U.K. lawmakers will decide on, as well as how Prime Minister Theresa May is faring, with the pound set to sell off if her leadership looks to be under threat. Investors also have to weigh up U.K. data, with production, jobs and inflation all due this week.
“We’ve got the most important data of the month squeezed into the same week as the politics,” said Jane Foley, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Rabobank. “In terms of the politics, if anything I’d expect sterling to be on the back foot.”
The premium that traders demand to insure against one-week volatility in sterling rose to its highest in almost four months on Thursday, ahead of the June 12 vote in the House of Commons. Yet strategists said they were surprised it wasn’t higher.
This could be because a lot of investors are “sidelined”, opting to wait for a clearer path before betting on the pound, said Rabobank’s Foley. This means the currency’s reaction to political headlines could be more muted than expected, she said. After May wrangled with her cabinet over Brexit policy, she has to get her Brexit law through Parliament, but opposition Labour party lawmakers are also divided on the approach.
The top-tier data due this week may provide a clearer signal to traders. Inflation is seen holding steady while jobs figures, crucial to the Bank of England view of slack in the economy, are also seen in line. Market pricing shows a 92 percent chance of an interest-rate hike by November this year, with banks including Nomura International Plc expecting the BOE to increase borrowing costs in August.
For Jordan Rochester, an analyst at the Japanese bank, the longer-term story is positive for the pound, with Parliament’s intervention set to usher in a softer Brexit and positive data likely to lead to a BOE hike. Yet he is not willing to take a bet on this week’s events.
“We’ve preferred long euro-dollar over pound-dollar in the more recent move and we’re just waiting to get past this week before getting involved again,” Rochester said.

With a rate hike already priced in investors will be watching out for any indications on the path of interest rates for the rest of the year.
The ECB is expected to leave rates unchanged after its meeting on Thursday, but markets may get an update on its plans for phasing out quantitative easing.
The U.S. - North Korea summit in Singapore on Tuesday will also be in focus, along with concerns over trade tensions after President Donald Trump said the U.S. wouldn’t endorse the final communique released at the end of a contentious weekend G7 summit.
The communique said the G7 leaders agreed on the need for ""free, fair, and mutually beneficial trade"" and the importance of fighting protectionism.
The week will also bring updates on U.S. inflation, retail sales and industrial production.
The UK is to release what will be closely watched reports on employment and wage growth, inflation and retail sales, while British Prime Minister Theresa May is facing a parliamentary vote that could challenge her Brexit policy on Tuesday.
The dollar ticked higher against a currency basket on Friday, while the safe haven yen also rose as investors turned cautious ahead of the G7 summit meeting in Canada after Trump vowed to deal with “unfair trade practices” by Canada and the European Union.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, hit a high of 93.83 before pulling back to 93.54 late Friday.

The central bank gave no details of how the fees would work, but they would be aimed at tackling the wide gap between the official exchange rate of 1.4 dinars to the dollar, and the parallel rate of around 7 dinars.
The gap is seen as a major factor in distorting Libya's oil-dependent economy, contributing to a liquidity crisis and causing corruption as those with access to dollars at the official rate make huge profits through import scams.
Libya was once one of the wealthiest countries in the region, but its economy has been crippled by conflict and political division over the past five years.
The central bank said the framework announced on Saturday was agreed with Fathi al-Majbari, who heads the economic file for the internationally recognized government in Tripoli.
The other tracks were described as addressing subsidies and ""creating a mechanism of compensation to mitigate the repercussions and effects of economic reform."" 
The statement came after an internationally mediated meeting in Tunis this week at which the central bank governor, Sadiq al-Kabir, said an agreement had been reached to take action on the exchange rate and reducing fuel subsidies by the end of July. [L5N1T75MB]
Officials with knowledge of the Tunis meeting said the compensation mechanism would be a cash transfer to offset the impact of reducing Libya's fuel subsidies, which are among the most generous in the world and have led to widespread fuel smuggling.
It is unclear to what extent officials in Tripoli can implement effective economic reform without the backing of eastern factions that support a parallel government and central bank based in Libya's east.

Previous pledges to act on the exchange rate and subsidies have come to little.

959,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 08, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",Brazil Real Jumps on `Considerable' Ammo; Argentine Peso Sinks,"(Bloomberg) -- It may not have been pretty, nor quick, but Brazil’s central bank finally became the latest emerging-market monetary authority to halt its currency’s depreciation. It was the opposite story in Argentina, where the peso sank after authorities announced a $50 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund and stepped back from defending the peso.
Brazil’s real rose for the first time in four days, jumping more than 5 percent and leading world gains, after the central bank pledged to flood the market with foreign-exchange swaps. Investors earlier this week ignored central bank attempts to bolster the currency, sending the real to a two-year low.
Unlike India and Turkey, both of which hiked interest rates, Brazil’s central bank says it won’t let the currency determine monetary policy decisions. Indian raised its benchmark rate on Wednesday for the first time since 2014, followed by Turkey, which surprised analysts by tightening policy for the third time in less than two months. Indonesia, which had lifted rates last week, said more tightening may come if needed. Argentina had already raised rates to a world-beating 40 percent.
While the central bank efforts did temporarily manage to stem downward spirals in emerging-market currencies, long-term stability will come only with economic policies that promote growth and balance budgets, said Per Hammarlund, the Stockholm-based chief emerging-market strategist at SEB SE. ""EM central bank monetary would have to be accompanied by prudent fiscal and investment-friendly economic policies,” he said.
Indeed, currencies in India and Indonesia initially rallied after the rate hikes, only to resume losses as investors concluded that interventions would smooth short-term volatility, not alter a currency’s path. The Turkish rally rose after the rate hike, then reversed course and finally flipped again, ending the week higher. The Argentine peso slumped to a record low on Friday in the absence of central bank intervention. The strong U.S. dollar also serves as a roadblock by diminishing the appeal of riskier assets.
That may be one reason Brazil, which cut interest rates in March, decided against a hike as the real plunged this week. Instead, central bank President Ilan Goldfajn called a surprise news conference Thursday night to underline how easily authorities can increase outstanding FX swaps and use currency reserves and credit line auctions to meet demand.
And that was enough, for now at any rate, to convince the market. “The Brazilian central bank continues to have considerable ammunition to intervene in FX markets,” said Gustavo Rangel, chief economist for Latin America at ING Financial Markets LLC in New York.

963,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2018 05:10AM ET</span>",Graphic: Asian economies less vulnerable than in the past,"By Gaurav Dogra and Patturaja Murugaboopathy 
(Reuters) - A sharp decline in Asian currencies this year on higher U.S. yields, rising oil prices and a resurgent U.S. dollar has brought attention back to regional economies' external balances and vulnerability in the recent emerging markets sell-off. 
Although Indonesia, South Korea, India and Malaysia are in the spotlight because their markets are more dependent on foreign investor flows, Asia is comparatively healthier this time than during previous regional crises in 1998 and 2013.
The biggest improvements are that the region's foreign exchange reserves have been replenished alongside a reduction in current account deficits.

However, some signs of weakness remain, and those could prove to be weak links as crude oil prices rise and the risks of a global trade war grow. 
Net oil importing countries - India, Indonesia and the Philippines - have the biggest current account deficits in the region and are thus vulnerable if they have to attract foreign money to foot bigger oil bills. 
To view a graphic on Asia current account balance and fx reserves, click: https://reut.rs/2JBI8du
Most of Asia's central banks have built up their foreign currency reserves over the past three years, leaving them with enough ammunition to protect their currencies from price volatility. The International Monetary Fund's conservative guide for reserves adequacy is that they be worth at least three months of imports.
All Asian economies have a foreign reserves to import ratio in excess of three, while Malaysia has the lowest ratio of 6.2.
But past crises have proved that short-term debt is an equally important consideration for sufficiency of reserves, and countries such as Indonesia, South Korea and Malaysia have a high proportion of foreign portfolio flows, or hot money, that could leave suddenly. Malaysia's external debt to GDP ratio is the highest in the region, followed by Indonesia and Thailand. 
To view a graphic on import cover, click: https://reut.rs/2Jt00rb
During times of emerging market crises, a country's fiscal deficit becomes a critical consideration as it influences ratings and foreign investor appetite for that market's assets. Rising crude oil prices are thus a risk as budget deficits in countries such as India and Indonesia could swell. 
To view a graphic on fiscal balance vs interest rates, click: https://reut.rs/2LkBKET
The comfort of stronger economic growth, led by domestic consumption, and of low inflation gives Asia a luxury with monetary policy it never had during previous crises.
Countries such as China, India and Indonesia have been able to intervene in currency markets and yet sterilise that intervention to keep domestic markets liquid. The macro mix has also allowed some countries to raise rates to put a floor under the currency. 
According to a Reuters poll, Indonesia's central bank is expected to raise interest rates two more times this year after hiking twice in May. Economists surveyed also expect India to increase its interest rates in August. 
India's inflation rate is the highest in the region, followed by the Philippines and Indonesia.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar wallowed near a three-week low against peers on Friday as U.S. Treasury yields fell sharply, while the euro's recovery remained intact amid expectations that the European Central Bank would begin unwinding it stimulus program.
The dollar index versus a basket of six major currencies (DXY) was little changed at 93.444 after declining 0.3 percent overnight, when it posted its fourth session of losses.
The index has fallen 0.75 percent this week, and plumbed 93.213 on Thursday, its lowest since May 17.
The dollar has come under pressure this week as the euro bounced back from 10-month lows thanks to an ebb in Italian political concerns and speculation that an ECB could signal intentions to start unwinding its big stimulus program when it holds a policy meeting on June 14.
The euro was effectively unchanged at $1.1796 (EUR=) after rising to a three-week high of $1.1840 overnight. It was up more than 1 percent on the week and was set to post its biggest weekly gain since mid-February.
The greenback was dragged further down as U.S. Treasury yields fell sharply on Thursday on the back of receding risk appetite in the broader markets.
""The latest moves in currencies are driven by developments in the bond markets. Risk aversion is taking place in such regions as Europe, which could see the ECB begin unwinding its stimulus,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior forex strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""There are also concerns toward next week's political and policy fixtures, such as the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting and the U.S.-North Korea summit.""
President Donald Trump is set to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. The main issue for the summit is the U.S. demand for North Korea to abandon a nuclear weapons program that now threatens the United States. 
The financial markets will have a platter full of upcoming events to digest, starting with the Group of Seven summit scheduled this weekend where trade issues between the United States and its major trade partners will come into focus.
The dollar was steady at 109.765 yen  after losing 0.45 percent overnight.
The pound was flat at $1.3420 , having slipped to a low of $1.3368 on Thursday on worries about Brexit negotiations before pulling back on the dollar's broader weakness.

The Australian dollar was a shade lower at $0.7617 , extending losses from the previous day when it was jerked back from a six-week high of $0.7677 after data showed a fall in the country's trade surplus.

The arbitrage trade, which had sunk to the lowest level in almost 12 years before the central bank raised interest rates on May 23, has now handed investors a gain of 6.1 percent since the day after the move. That’s more than three times as much as returns from Indonesia’s rupiah and India’s rupee which also saw rate increases in the past few days.
That’s not all. Projected carry trade in the lira, adjusted for volatility, has jumped to a three-week high. If the latest rate hike manages to reduce one-month implied volatility in the currency, this gauge of expected returns will increase further.

The rand tumbled as much as 2.1 percent to the weakest level since Dec. 15, days before Cyril Ramaphosa won the leadership of the African National Congress, putting him on course for the presidency. The currency’s decline worsened after the drop in Brazil’s real dampened sentiment toward risky assets, driving losses on a gauge that tracks emerging-market currencies to the most in more than a week.
The declines come after a report this week showed that South Africa’s economy shrank the most in nine years in the first quarter, casting a pall over Ramaphosa’s promise to boost growth. His rise to power since December initially boosted sentiment and the rand following Zuma’s scandal-ridden tenure, but confidence indexes have now returned to levels they were at late last year as businesses seek real reforms.
“This latest bout of rand weakness was triggered by the much weaker than expected first quarter GDP report, which suggested that the South African Reserve Bank probably wouldn’t be hiking anytime soon,” says Win Thin, the global head of emerging-markets strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. “I had always thought that the rand’s gains were overdone, and so I think markets are unwinding their optimistic ‘Ramaphoria’ bets now.”
Fragile State
The central bank last month left its main policy rate unchanged, and hinted that further loosening was off the table as inflation pressures build.
“It is clear that the economy is in a fragile state and it may take some time before we see any evidence of a Ramaphosa effect,” Natalie Rivett, a senior emerging-markets analyst at Infroma Global Markets in London.
The rand retreated 1.8 percent as of 4:44 p.m. in Johannesburg to 12.9464 per dollar. The yield on government debt due 2026 climbed 15 basis points to 8.81 percent."

Officials hiked rates 300 basis points at an emergency policy meeting last month as the lira hit a record low of 4.9233 per dollar.
The selloff came as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told Bloomberg TV that if he wins an election scheduled for later this month, he will step up his role in shaping economic policy.

971,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 08:43AM ET</span>",Dollar's reign likely to be a short one: Reuters poll,"(This story corrects error in euro exchange rate low in paragraph 10)
By Shrutee Sarkar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar's dominance is forecast to fade soon, with any sudden change in expectations for the policies of other central banks posing the biggest risk, a Reuters poll of currency strategists showed.
Nearly 60 percent, or 35 of 60 analysts, who answered an additional question in a poll taken this week said the dollar's recent resurgence would last about three months. Ten expect it to end within a month.
Fifteen analysts expect it to last for six months and the rest said it could be sustained for a year or more.
""We find it premature to crown the dollar king and extrapolate continued broad USD strength into and through the second half of the year,"" said Daniel Hui, executive director of global FX strategy at J.P. Morgan.
""Cyclical divergence favoring the USD is fading as global data gradually stabilizes and global policy normalization is still the baseline case.""
Reuters foreign exchange polls late last year and in early 2018 had predicted a weaker dollar, partly because of a deterioration in the U.S. fiscal position despite higher interest rates. Only recently did the dollar buck that overall trend. 
But expectations the Federal Reserve will raise rates next week and again later this year are already built into the dollar outlook. Predictions for the monetary policy of other central banks now matter more.
The euro rallied to a 10-day high against the dollar on Wednesday after European Central Bank Chief Economist Peter Praet said there would be a debate at the June 14 policy meeting, a day after the Fed is expected to raise rates, on ending the bank's bond-buying program by the end of 2018.
The ECB is expected to stop buying tens of billions of euros a month of bonds by December, according to a separate poll of economists [ECILT/EU].
Last week, the euro fell to a 10-month low of $1.1510, driven by the turmoil in Italian politics and signs of a slowdown in the euro zone economy, which cast doubts on whether the ECB would be able to withdraw stimulus this year.
That pushed the U.S. currency (DXY) to a six-month high last week and up over 2 percent in May. But the latest poll of over 60 foreign exchange analysts taken June 1-6 indicated its rally could not be sustained.
That suggests the recent reduction in bets against the dollar, now at their lowest in five months, was just a large unwinding of net short positions from the 6 1/2-year high reached in April.
""The dollar's short-covering rally is running out of steam with a lot of good news in terms of growth and rate expectations priced in,"" noted Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank.
In the poll, taken largely before Praet's comments, about 60 percent of over 40 analysts picked any change in monetary policy expectations as the biggest risk to the dollar. They considered that more important than the repercussions from any tit-for-tat trade war.
Indeed, an ongoing risk to the dollar stems from expected government bond issuance to pay for the tax cuts passed last year by the U.S. Congress.
""Fiscal expansion of such magnitude at this stage of the U.S. economic cycle will fuel fears on a larger deficit,"" said Gavin Friend, senior markets strategist at NAB in London.
Other major currencies are forecast to rise over the coming year. Sterling is expected to recoup much of its losses since the June 2016 decision to leave the European Union. [GBP/POLL] The euro (EUR=) is forecast to trade at $1.24 in a year, up over 5 percent from around $1.18 on Wednesday.
While the latest consensus for the single currency, driven by the political uncertainty surrounding Italy, was slightly weaker compared to the previous poll, the magnitude of the change from here in the June poll was more or less the same.
""In the short run, it's not obvious to me who wins out in the FX market - Italy or the ECB. In the long run, if you assume that this (Italian politics) isn't the crisis which brings Europe's house of cards crashing down, and it really shouldn't be, the ECB will dominate, in FX markets,"" said Kit Juckes, chief FX strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).

972,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 08:00AM ET</span>",Pound rebound to be kept in check by Brexit talks: Reuters poll,"By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling is likely to gain this year and by the time Britain leaves the European Union next March will have recouped a chunk of its losses since the June 2016 decision to leave the bloc, a Reuters poll suggested.
However, the pound is unlikely to re-test the levels above $1.43 it traded at earlier this year, when the Bank of England was expected to raise interest rates in May. Instead, the bank left rates unchanged. 
The currency is down around 10 percent since Britons voted to leave the EU, trading at $1.34 on Thursday, but some of those losses will be wiped out on expectations for rate hikes and a good divorce deal with the EU, according to the poll. 
Sterling's collapse was predicted in numerous Reuters polls before the Brexit referendum.
In a month's time, sterling  will be at $1.33, in six months at $1.35 and in a year it will have jumped to $1.41, the June 1-6 poll of more than 50 foreign exchange strategists predicted.
Last month the 12-month forecast was at $1.42 and in April - when the BoE was widely expected to raise interest rates in May - it was $1.44, the highest since the June 2016 Brexit referendum.
Economists were convinced the Bank would raise rates in May but dovish comments from BoE Governor Mark Carney together with a slew of downbeat data forced them to push those calls back to August in the most dramatic turnaround in Reuters polls history.
""Although more recent GBP-specific ebbs and flows have been driven by the sharp re-pricing of Bank of England policy expectations, we expect the focus for the pound over summer to shift back to Brexit politics,"" noted FX analysts at ING.
Uncertainty about the relationship Britain can agree with the EU after Brexit continues to cloud the currency's outlook. Forecasts for the 12-month outlook ranged from $1.23 to $1.54.
Lawmakers will vote next week on Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit blueprint. The vote may increase the probability of a ""soft"" Brexit, helping the pound. But it might also cast doubt on whether May will remain in charge, and her departure would probably weaken sterling.
""The lack of safe-haven flows to sterling during the Italian drama highlights belated investor unease about the lack of Brexit progress amidst economic underperformance and BoE indecisiveness,"" JP Morgan wrote in a note to clients.
Italy is the euro zone's third largest economy and last month was embroiled in a power struggle between pro-EU politicians and the anti-euro winners of a March election.
SNOW CLEARS
Better-than-expected business surveys this month have stoked expectations the Bank of England will raise interest rates by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent in August, as was predicted in a May 23 poll. 
Britain's economy almost flat-lined at the start of the year, at least in part due to heavy snow, and the Bank will be wanting to see evidence that the downturn was only temporary before it raises borrowing costs.
BoE rate-setter Silvana Tenreyro said on Monday much of the weakness in Britain's economy would probably prove temporary, but the timing of when rates would next go up remained an open question.
Turmoil in Italian politics and signs of a slowdown in the euro zone economy pushed the euro (EUR=) to a 10-month low of $1.1510 on May 29.
But comments by the European Central Bank's chief economist that the Bank would debate unwinding stimulus at next week's Governing Council gave the single currency a lift on Wednesday.
Against the common currency, the pound will move little, the survey suggested. On Wednesday a euro (EURGBP=) was worth 87.7 pence and in a year's time it will get you 88.0p, the poll said.

973,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 07:17AM ET</span>",Euro rebounds to three-week high on bets ECB will signal stimulus unwind,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro climbed to a three-week high on Thursday as investors raised their bets that the European Central Bank will next week signal a winding down of its vast bond-buying program by the end of this year.
The central bank's chief economist Peter Praet, a close ally of President Mario Draghi, said on Wednesday that the ECB would debate at its policy meeting next week whether to end bond purchases later this year.
Jens Weidmann, the head of Germany's central bank, said expectations the ECB would taper its bond-buying program by the end of this year were plausible while his Dutch counterpart, Klaas Knot, said there was no reason to continue a quantitative easing program.
The comments drove the euro to $1.1838 (EUR=), up half a percent on the day and its highest since May 17. 
Some analysts have taken the comments to suggest a decision is coming at the June 14 meeting but others saw it as the starting gun in a debate that will likely culminate in a decision in July.
Petr Krpata, currencies strategist at ING, said the most ""realistically bullish"" case was for the ECB to signal a one quarter extension of the bond-buying to end-December.
""If they say only one more quarter, that's the biggest upside potential for the euro,"" he said, adding that he was less bullish and expected the ECB to make the unwinding more open-ended and conditional on economic news. 
He said the euro's strength was limited given concerns about a trade war that could hit big euro zone exporters, and the possibility of a more hawkish Federal Reserve when it meets next week and is expected to raise interest rates for the second time this year. 
Many market players were surprised by the flurry of ECB comments as they had thought uncertainty caused by a political crisis in Italy would stay policymakers' hands.
Euro zone inflation will also need to stay close to the ECB's target for several months before policy is tightened, analysts said. 
""Our economists remain highly sceptical about the development of (core) inflation in the euro zone,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analysts wrote, describing some ""normalization fantasies"" as ""too high-flying"".
LIRA JUMPS
In emerging markets, the Turkish lira was the big mover of the day. 
The lira surged more than three percent  to below 4.47 lira against the dollar after the central bank hiked the benchmark interest rate by 125 basis points, more than expected.
The dollar index (DXY) slipped 0.4 percent to its weakest since May 17, helping currencies including sterling  claw back some of their recent losses. 
Despite the improving mood among investors on Thursday many remain cautious, especially ahead of a summit this weekend of the Group of Seven leaders when President Donald Trump looks set to clash with his counterparts over trade.
After a six-week long rapid rally the dollar has failed to break above key levels against some of its rivals, raising concerns the greenback's weakness may have more room to run. 
Against the yen , for example, it has failed to break above a 200 day moving average, potentially opening the door for more losses before a key G7 meeting this weekend.
The dollar fell 0.2 percent to 109.98 yen. 

The Australian dollar dipped 0.2 percent against the dollar to $0.7652 , off a 1-1/2-month high touched on Wednesday, boosted in part by the country's strong economic data.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's dollar will strengthen over the coming year as economic growth prompts the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates again, a Reuters poll showed, but strategists see risk to their bullish forecasts from NAFTA talks.
The poll of more than 40 foreign exchange strategists predicted the loonie will rise to C$1.27 to the greenback, or 78.74 U.S. cents, in three months, from around C$1.2954 on Thursday.
After hitting a 2-1/2-month low on Tuesday at C$1.3067, the currency is expected to climb further to C$1.25 in a year.
""The Canadian economy is hitting its potential growth rate,"" said Derek Halpenny, European head of global markets research at MUFG Bank. ""This will result in the BoC raising rates in July.""
Canada's central bank has raised its benchmark interest rate three times since last summer to leave it at 1.25 percent. Economists polled by Reuters expect it to hike twice more this year. 
Chances of further tightening as soon as next month have climbed to about 70 percent, data from the overnight index swaps market showed, from less than 50 percent before a recent policy statement from the central bank that was more hawkish than the market had expected. 
""We think the Bank of Canada will basically be on a hiking path that is not dissimilar to the Federal Reserve,"" said Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Canada and Monex Europe, who expects the loonie to strengthen to C$1.19 in 12 months.
Berich said Canada has ""a lot of leverage over the United States"" in negotiations to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement because it is a major buyer of American goods, including many manufactured products. But if the U.S. does withdraw from the 24-year-old accord it could ""blow the loonie to pieces.""
Canada sends about 75 percent of its exports to the United States.
In addition to slow-moving NAFTA talks, policymakers have been fretting recently about the impact of new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
Top U.S. allies are set for a showdown with Washington at this week's G7 summit in Canada as the Trump administration shows no sign of backing down from protectionist policies that have upset trading partners and unnerved investors.
Reduced risk appetite could weigh on the Canadian dollar because Canada depends on capital flows to finance its current account deficit.
""When risk aversion picks up, volatility picks up, capital flows tend to dry up and you get risk of undershooting on the exchange rate,"" said Ben Randol, senior FX strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).

975,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 05:50AM ET</span>","Uncertainty surges around Brazil, Mexico FX rates after selloff","By Bruno Federowski
BRASILIA (Reuters) - The Brazilian and Mexican currencies are set to strengthen, but forecasts from market strategists polled by Reuters span an extremely wide range, suggesting that expectations for an imminent rebound from a recent selloff may be premature. 
Brazil's real (BRBY) is now expected to strengthen 8.8 percent to 3.5 to the dollar in 12 months, according to the median of 26 estimates compiled June 4-5, compared to 3.4 in a previous poll. It is down over 16 percent since February.
Mexico's peso , battered down over 10 percent since April, is set to firm 8.6 percent to 18.83 to the dollar, up from 18.5.
Though seemingly small changes after both currencies plummeted almost 6 percent in May, the headline figures likely undersell the extent to which the shock is forcing forecasters to redo their math.
The standard deviation for Brazilian real estimates, a commonly used gauge of dispersion, soared to the highest since the monthly poll published in May 2016, when impeachment proceedings against former president Dilma Rousseff drove up uncertainty all around. The standard deviation for Mexican peso estimates reached a 15-month high.
This would suggest that forecasters are finally taking in a spike in U.S. bond yields, growing chances of a trade rift between the United States and Mexico and a lower likelihood that the winner of Brazil's elections this year will manage to cut government spending, after taking those risks in stride for months.
""Some strategists are probably waiting until things calm down before revising their forecasts, but there's no denying that the dollar spike was much faster than nearly anyone expected,"" Mizuho Securities chief strategist Luciano Rostagno said. ""This could be just the first step of a larger wave of revisions.""
Rostagno himself revised his forecasts for the real after a nationwide truckers' strike against high diesel prices in the final weeks of May forced the government to introduce diesel subsidies even as it struggles to plug a growing budget deficit.
The strike drove several economists to downgrade estimates for gross domestic product growth and raise inflation forecasts.
More importantly, however, it may have exposed the frailty of forecasters' repeated assurance that the winner of this year's presidential elections, set to be the most hard-to-predict in decades, would maintain a platform of spending cuts, privatizations and deregulation.
""Public opinion proved to be very favorable towards the strike, which shows that the population does not endorse an agenda of reforms. This is concerning as Brazil is in a delicate fiscal situation and reforms are needed to drive public debt back to a sustainable path,"" Rostagno said.
A recent poll showed this year's race dominated by the right and the left, with law-and-order lawmaker Jair Bolsonaro as a clear frontrunner followed by populist Ciro Gomes. Centrist candidates seem to be struggling to take off.
Mexico is also facing its own presidential elections which have given investors reason to pause.
Nationalist Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who has drawn opposition from some in the business community for his plans to revise oil contracts and an airport under construction in Mexico City, remains a clear frontrunner, but the composition of Congress is all but a question mark.
Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump seems increasingly bent on scrapping the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and turning instead to bilateral negotiations, raising the threat of U.S. protectionism that forecasters had largely brushed off in several Reuters polls.
That drove strategists at Nomura Securities to recommend in a recent report that clients bet on weakness in the Mexican peso when compared to the Colombian peso, saying those risks are ""likely to either compound any selloff pressure or cap any rally potential in the MXN coming from shifts in external risk sentiment.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro rose to a nearly two-week high against the dollar on Wednesday after officials said the European Central Bank could wind down its stimulus program by the end of the year, as inflation has risen to its target. 
Europe's common currency was on track to post its largest weekly gain versus the dollar since mid-February.
Having revived growth with an unprecedented 2.55 trillion euro ($2.99 trillion) bond purchase program, the ECB has been debating whether to end the purchases this year as the threat of deflation has passed and the bloc is on its best growth run in a decade. 
Many traders expected the central bank to remain cautious at its June 14 policy meeting, given the uncertainty caused by a political crisis in Italy. 
But ECB chief economist Peter Praet said on Wednesday the central bank would next week debate whether to unwind bond purchases gradually. 
Germany's central bank head said market expectations for an end to bond-buying this year were plausible.
""The notion that the ECB could end stimulus sooner rather than later is a boon for the euro as it suggests an earlier arrival of an eventual rate hike from rock-bottom levels,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.
Praet's comments pushed the euro to $1.1796 (EUR=), the highest since May 22, and it also hit a more-than-one-week high of 1.1640 francs versus the safe-haven Swiss franc (EURCHF=).
""A breach of the $1.18 barrier will attract more euro bulls,"" said Viash Sreemuntoo, corporate trader at XE.
As well as boosting the euro, analysts said the comments would introduce heightened volatility in the options markets over the ECB meeting.
""Markets have already factored in a U.S. rate hike; that means the ECB is the most likely trigger for heightened volatility and I'm expecting to see that as we head into the meeting,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX strategy at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
The euro's rise put pressure on the U.S. dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback versus a basket of six major currencies. The index fell 0.4 percent to 93.518.
The ECB comments followed a speech by Italy's new Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, whose promise of radical change had a mixed impact on the euro.
""The Italians have a government and it is doing what it said it would do,"" said John Taylor, president and founder of research firm Taylor Global Vision in New York.

""In itself that should be normal, but in this case it is shocking to the idea of Europe as it has be constructed by Brussels, the German government, and the ECB/Bundesbank,"" he added.

Prior to market opening, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the midpoint rate  at 6.4040 per dollar, 117 pips firmer than the previous fix and in line with a softer dollar. 
The spot market  opened at 6.4036 per dollar and climbed to 6.3910 at one point, the strongest since May 28.
As of midday, the spot yuan was changing hands at 6.3951, 57 pips firmer than the previous late session close and 0.14 percent stronger than the midpoint.
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies due to a firmer euro (EUR=) and concerns that the United States could pull out of a trade pact with Canada and Mexico. [FRX/] 
Traders said the 6.4 per dollar was a psychologically important level for investors, with rising corporate demand for the greenback emerging after the yuan strengthened past the threshold.
""The yuan didn't change its direction to a strengthening path as (many corporate clients) were scooping up cheaper dollars in morning trade,"" a trader at a foreign bank in Shanghai said.
The trader expected the yuan could face some downward pressure in the near term as June marks a traditional peak for dollar demand.
Some market participants said the yuan could also face volatility from the outcome of the European Central Bank's policy meeting on June 14, which could put pressure on emerging markets if the ECB states when its stimulative policy will end. 
Separately, the PBOC lent 463 billion yuan ($72.40 billion) to financial institutions on Wednesday via its 1-year medium-term lending facility (MLF), with interest rates unchanged.
Analysts believe the central bank may be adjusting the way it conducts its various liquidity operations as financing conditions change, with Wednesday's move possibly pushing back the timing of another expected cut in banks' reserve requirement ratios.

985,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 05, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",Brazil's Heavier Hand in Currency Market Can't Stop Real's Slump,"(Bloomberg) -- Brazil’s extraordinary efforts to shore up its currency weren’t enough to stem a rout that left the real at the weakest level since former President Dilma Rousseff’s impeachment in 2016.
Policy makers offered to sell an additional $1.5 billion of swaps contracts Tuesday, beyond the $750 million they had been auctioning daily, after the currency fell to a two-year low. While the real initially pared losses, the recovery faded by late afternoon. It was down 1.8 percent to 3.8132 per dollar as of 4:19 p.m. in New York.
“Any central bank that tries to intervene in their FX market is only inviting speculators to test the bank’s will,” said James Gulbrandsen, a Rio de Janeiro-based money manager who helps oversee $3.5 billion of assets at NHC Capital. “For the bank, it typically ends in feeling like you’re drinking water from a fire hose.”
The real has weakened 13 percent since the end of March, the worst performance among major currencies, as investors grow concerned that October elections could usher in a new president less attuned to investors and business. Fear that fixes to fiscal problems would be derailed have exacerbated what’s already been a lackluster year in emerging markets.
Still, Gulbrandsen said the real is beginning to look attractive at current levels, and if it were to weaken to 4 per dollar he’d “load the boat” buying the currency.
The central bank sold about 22,000 of the 30,000 contracts if offered at two extra auctions. It placed all 15,000 contracts in the day’s regularly scheduled sale. The amount that remained unsold isn’t enough to worry traders and will likely be added to tomorrow’s daily auction, according to Hideaki Iha, a trader at Fair Corretora, who said policy makers weren’t willing to give the investors as high a rate as they were pushing for.
While the swaps don’t change the supply of physical dollars in Brazil, they support the real by meeting demand from investors who want to hedge against the risk of the decline in the Brazilian currency. They also boost onshore dollar loan rates, encouraging commercial banks to bring greenbacks into Brazil to profit from the higher rates onshore.
“The central bank got the timing right, coming in to try to curb a speculative move,” said Italo Abucater, the head of foreign-exchange trading at Tullett Prebon brokerage.

992,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 04, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>",China Revives Global Yuan Push as Capital Outflow Worries Fade,"(Bloomberg) -- After more than two years on the back-burner, there are signs that China is once again focusing on its efforts to increase the yuan’s status in global finance.
Since May, initiatives from the central bank and government have included:
The yuan grabbed a record 2.8 percent slice of global payments three years ago, before a crackdown on outflows in the wake of the 2015 devaluation saw that figure shrink to 1.7 percent as of April. These days -- with China’s foreign reserves rising and volatility staying low -- officials have a window to refocus on President Xi Jinping’s quest for a bigger Chinese role in global finance.
""There will surely be more utilization of the currency in cross-border transfers this year,"" said Ji Tianhe, a China rates and foreign-exchange strategist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA. ""The exchange rate will be influenced by global financial markets more. Offshore investors will also become a more important driver for onshore bonds.""
Recent strength in the yuan -- which had its biggest rally in 10 years in the first quarter -- has given policy makers room to relax curbs on outflows. China’s foreign reserves, the world’s biggest, increased in all but only three months since the start of last year, while overseas demand for the currency is showing some signs of picking up. Hong Kong yuan deposits increased the most since 2011 in April, according to data released last week.
Building Ties
On top of other measures, a long-term project also may also help boost the yuan’s role: Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative to deepen economic ties with countries across the Eurasian landmass and beyond.
""BRI trade and investment would definitely increase currency flows between China and other Belt and Road countries,"" said Ben Yuen, Hong Kong-based fixed-income chief investment officer at BOCHK Asset Management Ltd.
The pace of moves to broaden the yuan’s role remains captive to investor confidence. A steeper rally in the greenback, which just capped its seventh week of gains, could renew concern about a depreciating yuan. The stock market remains stuck in the doldrums, despite MSCI Inc. adding local stocks to its gauges and rising corporate defaults are rippling through the nation’s bond market.
For now, foreign funds appear bullish on Chinese assets, buying a record amount of the nation’s shares last month, while also emerging as the dominant force in government debt. Although the yuan has fallen 2.5 percent against the dollar from its March high, there’s little concern about moves getting out of control -- one-month implied volatility is near an almost five-month low.
Conditions are ripe for officials to take additional steps to boost its global sway, according to MK Tang, Hong Kong-based senior China economist at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). These may include making it easier for foreigners to buy Chinese bonds and allowing domestic investors to buy more overseas assets.

For the week ending May 29, dollar shorts fell 16,000 and sit now at minus 12,000, narrowing the discount on the dollar, pointing to ""a higher hurdle for further rounds of dollar strength,"" JPMorgan said.
Ahead of the parliamentary vote on Italy's new government, sentiment soured on the EUR/USD, which fell to $1.1688 from a high of $1.1745, aiding the greenback's recovery from session lows.
Italy’s new populist government is reportedly preparing for a confidence vote in both houses of parliament, which could reportedly come as soon as Tuesday.
The two populist parties – Five Star Movement and League – hold a majority in both houses of parliament, but boast a slender margin over the opposition of just 14 votes in the 320-seat Senate.
Analysts expect some friction to emerge in the second round of parliamentary votes on which of the expensive electoral promises from each party to keep.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar gained against the yen on Monday after the release of an upbeat U.S. jobs report, although uncertainty over potential political risks kept the currency's near-term outlook murky.
The dollar added 0.15 percent to 109.660 yen  following a rise of 0.6 percent on Friday.
Closely watched data out on Friday showed U.S. jobs growth gathering pace and wages rising in May, making a rate hike by the Federal Reserve in June a near certainty and increasing expectations of a fourth hike this year. 
The robust U.S. jobs report helped offset factors that had weighed on the dollar earlier last week, such as a flare up in trade tensions between the United States and its allies.
""The jobs report was strong but other recent U.S. data also point to strong fundamentals, helping the dollar recover losses suffered from risk aversion. Uncertainty over the U.S.-North Korea summit next week is still likely to cap the dollar's upside,"" said Shin Kadota, senior strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Tokyo.
The greenback dipped against a basket of six major currencies, weighed by the euro's bounce against the greenback. The dollar index slipping 0.15 percent to 94.029 (DXY) after gaining about 0.2 percent on Friday.
The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.1685 (EUR=), recovering the bulk of Friday's losses.
The prospect of a snap election in Italy shook investor risk sentiment at the start of last week as some feared the vote could be a referendum on the country's euro membership.
But the euro has drifted up since as markets gained some composure after anti-establishment parties reached a deal to resurrect their proposed coalition government, averting potentially destabilizing elections.
""While worries over Italy may have subsided somewhat, the bottom line is that the U.S. economy is doing better than its European peers, and this will continue to weigh on the euro,"" Kadota at Barclays said.
The single currency remained in sight of a 10-month low of $1.1510 set earlier last week when concerns over Italian politics peaked in the global markets.
""Focus will likely shift back from Italy to European Central Bank policy,"" said Mitsuo Imaizumi, chief forex strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
""The prospect of the ECB immediately following the Fed in normalizing monetary policy has waned. The euro will be sensitive to any comments by ECB officials which suggest the central bank is less enthusiastic about normalizing policy.""
The Australian dollar rose on an improvement in broader risk sentiment and upbeat domestic data showing strong company profits and a rise in retail sales. The Aussie was 0.4 percent higher at $0.7599 .

999,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 03, 2018 06:58AM ET</span>",Forex - Weekly Outlook: June 4 - 8,"Investing.com - With little data on the economic calendar, markets could focus more heavily on trade-related headlines in the coming week as President Donald Trump prepares to meet world leaders at the G7 summit in Canada.
There could be major developments on the trade front with China during the coming week, as well, and more clarity on whether revisions to the North American Free Trade Agreement can be concluded before a looming deadline.
Staying on the subject, market participants will focus on monthly trade figures out of the United States and China, as they seek to gauge if there has been any impact from the recent trade dispute between the world's two largest economies.
The dollar rose against a basket of peers on Friday, after a blowout jobs report suggested that the Federal Reserve remains on track to raise interest rates later this month and later this year.
The U.S. economy added 223,000 jobs in May, above the expected a gain of 189,000, while the unemployment rate dropped to an 18-year low of 3.8%.
The U.S. Labor Department's report also showed solid wage gains, pointing to rapidly tightening labor market conditions, which could stir concerns about inflation.
Separately, the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index rose to 58.7, up 1.4 points from April and a two-month high.
The upbeat data prompted market players to increase their bets on the number of Fed rate hikes through the end of the year, with the U.S. central bank now seen increasingly likely to raise rates three more times, in addition to the one they approved in March.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, ended up around 0.2% at 94.16, after hitting a high of 94.44.
The index was largely unchanged for the week, while it was up 2.4% in May.
The greenback strengthened almost 0.7% versus the Japanese yen last buying 109.55 (USD/JPY). For the week, the buck gained 0.2% on the yen.
Elsewhere, the euro slipped to $1.1657 (EUR/USD), but the single currency broke a six-week losing streak following a drop in Italian bond yields after a revived coalition deal between Italy's two anti-establishment parties reduced concerns of immediate elections.
Political turmoil in Italy earlier this week drove the euro to a 10-month low.
Meanwhile, the British pound strengthened against the dollar and the euro on Friday as data showed UK manufacturing growth picking up speed in May.

1000,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2018 02:50AM ET</span>",Le Maire Tells Germany It's Now or Never to Strengthen Euro Zone,"(Bloomberg) -- French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has a message for the German government on reform in the euro area: “It is now or never - jetzt oder nie.”
After more than eight hours of tough talks with his counterparts from the Group of Seven that focused mostly on a trade dispute with the U.S., Le Maire found some time to reiterate -- in German -- his call on Chancellor Angela Merkel to move forward with reforms. His channel of choice: journalists from Germany’s biggest newspapers who accompanied Finance Minister Olaf Scholz to a ski resort in Whistler, Canada.
“We can’t only rely on monetary policy and quantitative easing to deal with potential future crises in the euro zone and we have to bid on something new, and that is a common fiscal capacity, if we want to reinforce stabilization and the convergence among the 19 member states,” Le Maire told reporters Friday. “We need to agree together on a clear and ambitious approach. We can’t satisfy ourselves with a kind of loose consensus, something that won’t be clear, won’t be ambitious and stays on the same lines.”
Efforts are focusing on reaching a deal by late June on two key aspects of the euro area: beefing up the bloc’s bailout fund and completing the so-called banking union through the establishment of a backstop for a fund to help wind down failed banks and, crucially, a common deposit insurance scheme.
While there is consensus on the first two, significant disagreements persist on the latter, as hawkish countries such as Germany and the Netherlands are reluctant to take steps that they say would put their taxpayers on the hook for risks lurking in balance sheets of vulnerable banks across the bloc.
For Le Maire, time is of the essence, and a joint ministerial meeting set for June 19 a de facto deadline to find agreement ahead of an EU summit at the end of the month -- before state elections in Bavaria and preparations for a European parliament election divert attention.
While Merkel herself shares the sense of urgency transmitted by the French -- she aims for “important, key decisions” and told German lawmakers last month that governments must step up efforts to integrate the euro area because European Central Bank stimulus won’t last forever -- she’s constrained by fiscal conservatives in her own ranks. Members of the Christian Democratic-led bloc have rejected some of the French proposals, including a euro-area budget and a joint finance minister.
Le Maire reminded German politicians that France has “also taken very difficult decisions.” In his view, now it’s Germany’s turn to act.
“If the answer from Germany is we won’t make any move, that’s a problem,” he said. “But that is not what I am hearing and we have started to make some progress.”
Le Maire said he’s confident a compromise can be found. “A fiscal capacity doesn’t mean transfer union.” And to make absolutely sure the message was received, he repeated his point in German.

1001,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Venezuela says postponed currency overhaul now set for Aug. 4,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela said on Saturday a postponed currency overhaul to remove three zeroes from the devalued bolivar would take place on Aug. 4, two months later than originally planned. 
President Nicolas Maduro's socialist government is taking the measure in response to high inflation and a devastating economic crisis that has made it increasingly difficult to find cash and left millions struggling to obtain basic foodstuffs.
Banking industry leaders had asked for a postponement from the original June 4 date, given that the new notes and transaction systems were nowhere near ready.
Saturday's government communique urged financial institutions to prepare well for the Aug. 4 change ""to facilitate the population's financial transactions and protect our currency.""
Venezuela's annual inflation is now close to 14,000 percent, according to the opposition-controlled legislature, as the country's socialist economic system spirals downward. 
Cash is in short supply because new banknotes have not been printed fast enough to keep up with price increases, spurring a growing use of phone apps for transactions. 
Late socialist leader Hugo Chavez in 2008 carried out a similar so-called monetary conversion that removed three zeroes from the currency. 
But the bolivar has depreciated by 99 percent since Maduro took office in 2013, while unchecked expansion of money supply has given the country the world's fastest rate of inflation.
Most economists say shedding three zeroes from the currency is a palliative measure that would need to be repeated unless Maduro makes deep reforms to the country's dysfunctional currency controls and excessive money creation. 

Maduro, who portrays the country as the victim of an ""economic war,"" has in the past accused adversaries of stealing the country's bills and smuggling them to neighboring Colombia.

Investors moved more than $73 million of the SPDR Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF, or EBND, on Thursday. That was the most since November 2012 and more than 14 times the daily average volume in the past year. A larger fund, the VanEck Vectors J.P. Morgan EM Local Currency Bond ETF, or EMLC, posted turnover of $253 million Thursday, more than five times its daily average in the past year.
It’s no surprise that investors are heading for the exits, as local currency emerging-market credit is taking a beating. In May, local sovereign bonds posted a negative 0.75 percent total return and the MSCI Emerging Markets Currency Index fell nearly 1.4 percent.
But despite investor caution, some see the rout as a chance to enter the market. For example, Didier Lambert, a portfolio manager at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)., is finding value in countries with low inflation that boosts real yields. He’s betting on nations like Indonesia, Brazil and South Africa. And he’s not alone in his convictions.
“The EM local market is looking more valuable as some investors have exited,” said Michael Roche, a New York-based strategist at Seaport Global Holdings. “Those remaining are more strategic in outlook and less prone to abruptly leave the sector.”"

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro consolidated gains on Friday and is set to break a six-week losing streak following a drop in Italian bond yields after a revived coalition deal between Italy's two anti-establishment parties reduced concerns of immediate elections.
The single currency plunged earlier this week and Italian bond yields soared, with 2-year bond yields posting their biggest one-day jump in 26 years on Tuesday on fears that fresh elections in the euro zone's third biggest economy could strengthen the hand of anti-establishment parties.
But the past two days have seen some stability with the euro recouping its losses thanks in part to renewed efforts to form a government and avoid new elections, ending three months of political turmoil.
Analysts were also getting more cautious of the dollar's recent move higher -- the greenback hit a 6-1/2 month high against a basket of its rivals earlier this week -- on trade war fears and rising concerns the U.S. economic momentum may soften. 
""At these levels, I think the dollar is nearly priced to perfection and we think the euro should see a rebound from later this year,"" said Paul Baird, head of fixed income at Newton Asset Management, a subsidiary of BNY Mellon which manages $49.8 billion in assets globally.
On Friday, the euro (EUR=EBS) was flat at $1.1691 against the dollar. On a weekly basis, it is set to eke out a small 0.3 percent gain, snapping six consecutive weeks of losses. 
The dollar edged higher at 94.02 after posting its biggest monthly rise since November 2016 in May against a basket of rivals (DXY). It headed back towards a  6-1/2 month high of 95.03 hit earlier this week.
Risk appetite was on the back foot after the Donald Trump administration slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the EU, Mexico and Canada, raising risks of a full blown trade war.
Canada and Mexico retaliated against the United State's decision while the European Union had its own reprisals ready to go..
The Canadian dollar stood at C$1.2936 to the U.S. dollar , after falling 0.65 percent the previous day.
The Mexican peso  hit a 15-month low of 20.050 to the dollar on Thursday and last stood at 19.85 per dollar. 

A heavy slate of data on Friday is also expected to keep investors on the sidelines. The US jobs report for May is expected to show almost 190,000 jobs added, keeping the Fed on track to raise rates later this month. Flash PMIs in euro zone, United States and Britain are also due.

China’s stocks could account for 17 percent of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index in five years’ time, from less than half a percent now,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategist Timothy Moe said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Friday. Total inflows associated with MSCI inclusion will be about $22 billion after the second inclusion day later this year, he said, compared with $60 to $70 billion average daily trading value in China.
“Clearly, the initial impact right here, right now is modest,” Moe said. “But the symbolism in our view is very, very important.”
Market reaction to the inclusion was hardly euphoric on Friday, as the Shanghai Composite Index slid 0.5 percent, heading for its seventh loss in eight sessions.

Japan and China released their manufacturing data, and the U.S. reignited likelihood of a global trade war.
The U.S. dollar index climbed to this year’s fresh high at 94.93 on Wednesday then lost its rally. The index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies added 0.16% to 94.10 at 11:20PM ET (03:20 GMT). 
On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration said the EU, Canada and Mexico would be soon subject to tariffs on imported steel and aluminum as White House refused to extend the reprieve.
This is another move by the U.S. to impose tariffs to target other countries, including the tariffs on US$50 billion worth of Chinese imports earlier. Canada, Mexico, Europe and China all said they would retaliate quickly and in kind.
In Japan, the USD/JPY pair gained 0.33% to 109.18. The yen did not react to Japan’s stronger-than-expected economic data on Friday. Capital spending by Japanese companies rose 3.4% in the January-March quarter from a year earlier, compared to the estimated 3.2%.
In addition, Japan's manufacturing PMI(PMI) for May also came in at 52.8, beating the forecast 52.5. For PMI, a reading above 50 signals an improvement, while one below 50 points means a contraction in manufacturing activity.
On a side note, the Bank of Japan reduced the purchases of Japanese Government Bond maturing in 5-10 years to 430 billion yen from the previous 450 billion yen. While the drop in bond purchases by the central bank is widely considered bullish for the domestic currency, the yen did not pick up either.

1011,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",Decline and fall? How Italy fell out of love with the euro,"By Alastair Macdonald and Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Italians used to love the euro. Now they are not so sure, voting for populist parties whose prospective government has spooked investors fearful that Italy might quit the monetary union.
It is a tale of a romance gone sour over two decades of monotony, as Italy's economy has stagnated since it ditched the ever-devaluing lira for the EU's newly minted common currency.
Mirroring that disenchantment, Germans who were reluctant to give up their beloved Deutschmark have seen their economy power forward since the euro was introduced in 1999 -- and they have warmed to the now 19-nation currency, as Italians have cooled.
The European Commission has been tracking support across the EU for the euro in its Eurobarometer survey since the 1990s while its Eurostat statistics agency collates economic data. 
To view a graphic on How support for the euro tracks income growth, click: https://tmsnrt.rs/2LaYB5w
In 2000, with the euro a year old in bank accounts but still not in Europeans' pockets as notes and coins, fully four Italians in five -- 81 percent -- thought it a good idea while only 50 percent of Germans were in favor of sharing their rock-solid mark with a country where an espresso cost 1,000 lire.
For comparison among the three big economies which joined the euro zone, the French were somewhat middling, with two thirds of them seeing mainly benefits from giving up the franc.
Fast forward to today, and there is a dramatic turnaround, both in attitudes to the euro and the state of EU economies.
Italy's national income has grown in real terms by just 3 percent since 2000, according to Eurostat's measure of GDP at constant 2010 prices. Germans were fully 24 percent better off last year compared to 17 years earlier, the French 22 percent.
Over the same period, Italians' support for the euro has plunged, to 59 percent in the last Eurobarometer survey in November. That, however, reflected an upturn from a lows of 53 percent hit in 2012-13, at the height of the debt crises in other euro states, and again in 2016 after Greece's bankruptcy and an EU crisis over Mediterranean migrants rocked Italy.
Conversely, while French support is broadly steady, German backing for the euro has hit 80 percent, climbing steadily since its early days, when the reunited Germany's economy was for a time Europe's ""sick man"". That, say some critics, is because Berlin has pressured the EU to run the euro for German benefit.
The anti-establishment 5-Star movement and the League have denounced the effect of euro membership on Italy and EU limits on public borrowing but they are not calling for a referendum on ""Italexit"" -- two private polls on Thursday found that 60-72 percent of Italians still prefer to keep the euro.

EU officials say Italy can still benefit from the single currency but must reform its economy so that it can recover international competitiveness without having recourse to the currency devaluations on which it relied in the last century.

EUR/USD was up 0.08% to 1.1672 by 10:35 AM ET (14:35 GMT), after rising as high as 1.1724 earlier. 
U.S Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Thursday that the U.S. was moving ahead with tariffs on aluminum and steel imports from Canada, Mexico and the EU, ending a two-month exemption and potentially setting the stage for a trade war.
The ratcheting up of trade tensions offset optimism that the Italian political crisis can be resolved before too long.
The single currency has rebounded after falling to ten-month lows of 1.1509 on Tuesday amid fears that repeat elections in Italy could give a mandate for the country to exit the euro zone.
Fresh attempts by Italy’s anti-establishment Five Star and Lega parties to revive their coalition plans raised hopes of a resolution, but investors remained cautious as political risk in the euro area remained elevated. 
In Spain, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is facing a vote of no confidence in the government on Friday, which is likely to pass.
Investors were also wary amid ongoing concerns about a trade spat between the U.S. and China, as well the situation in North Korea.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro rallied further on Thursday as Italian parties renewed attempts to form a government, easing concerns about the wider impact of a political crisis in the euro zone's third-largest economy.
The rise of a potentially eurosceptic government in Italy and the impact that could have on the stability of Europe has seen the euro fall 3.5 percent this month amid a resurgent dollar. 
A degree of calm, however, has returned with two anti-establishment parties renewing efforts to form a coalition government rather than force Italy into holding elections for the second time this year.
The euro on Thursday climbed to a three-day high of $1.1725, having risen 1.1 percent the previous day, its second-biggest daily gain so far this year. It had hit a 10-month low of $1.1510 on Tuesday.
The rally followed remarks by Italian Prime Minister-designate Carlo Cottarelli on Wednesday that possibilities had emerged ""for the birth of a political government,"" suggesting politicians, rather than technocrats like himself, might be able to steer the country out of deadlock.
That has eased fears of fresh Italian elections, a vote some say would effectively be a referendum on Italy's euro membership.
""There's some calm now and the $1.15 level looks like a trough for the euro for the time being,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Thu Lan Nguyen.
""But the markets are likely to remain in thrall of the political crisis in Italy. Euro investors should therefore remain vigilant,"" she said.
Others also remained cautious.
""As the Italian bond spreads have shrunk, the euro is being bought back. But the situation still looks murky and it is far from certain whether the euro's recovery becomes full-fledged,"" said Naoya Oshikubo, strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
The euro is set for its biggest monthly drop in more than three years, according to Thomson Reuters data.
An underlying theme that has pushed the euro lower since mid-April is a slowdown in Europe and the subsequent retreat in expectations for an early rate hike from the European Central Bank.
Financial markets expect the ECB to wind down its 2.55 trillion-euro stimulus program by the end of this year and raise its policy interest rate towards the middle of next year.
Weaker-than-expected economic data out of the euro zone, however, has raised questions about that.
Apart from developments in Italy, investors are also looking to the upcoming euro zone consumer price data  at 0900 GMT, which is expected to show inflation has accelerated to 1.6 percent in May.
While the calmer mood around Italy helped to knock the yen off its five-week high hit on Tuesday, many investors are also wary of a potential escalation in trade frictions.
Sources said the United States will announce plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from the European Union, affirming a report in the Wall Street Journal.
The dollar shed 0.3 percent to 108.60 yen JPY= on Thursday morning, edging back towards Tuesday's five-week low of 108.115 yen.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies (DXY) was down 0.3 percent on the day at 93.833.
Against the greenback, the Canadian dollar  strengthened as much as 1.4 percent on Wednesday after the country's central bank held interest rates steady but suggested that it could raise rates soon, possibly as early as July.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro recovered on Wednesday from 10-month lows after reports that Italy's biggest party would make a renewed attempt to form a coalition government and end months of political turmoil.
An attempt by two anti-establishment parties to form a new government in Italy collapsed at the weekend, raising the prospect of an early election. Markets feared that election would become a de facto referendum on Italy's use of the euro.
A source close to 5-Star, the single largest party in the new parliament, said the party would try again to form a coalition with the right-wing League.

The euro rallied and Italian government bond yields (IT10YT=RR)  settled below multi-year highs after Tuesday's market slide.
A smooth auction of Italian government debt also helped soothe market jitters.
The single currency, which plunged to a 10-month low of $1.1510 on Tuesday, rose as much as 0.7 percent to $1.1624 (EUR=) on Wednesday. It remains down 4 percent this month against the dollar.

U.S. bond yields have fallen over the past couple of days, undermining the dollar's yield attraction and a key reason for the currency's rally. 
That, however, is not stopping analysts from predicting more dollar strength.

EUR/USD rose 0.6% to 1.1603 by 04:07 AM ET (08:07 AM GMT), pulling away from Tuesday’s 10-month lows of 1.1509.
The single currency has fallen around 4.1% against the dollar so far this month.
Financial markets were hit after Italy’s populist parties abandoned their bid to form a coalition government after the country’s president vetoed their choice of finance minister over his threats to pull Italy out of the euro zone, raising the prospect of fresh elections.
Investors fear that repeat elections could be seen as a referendum on Italy's role in the European Union and its future in the euro area and may end up bolstering euro sceptic parties even more.
Market sentiment received a boost following reports that the two mooted coalition partners, Five Star and the Lega party, could make a new attempt to form a government.
But investors remained wary as political risk in the euro area remained elevated. In Spain, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is facing a vote of no confidence in the government on Friday, after a corruption case involving members of the ruling party.
A ratcheting up of the trade row between the U.S. and China also kept investors on edge after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would be proceeding with $50bn worth of tariffs on Chinese imports.

The yen was also supported by Japan’s monthly retail sales data, which beat expectation by posting 1.6% growth for April versus the estimated 0.9% and the 1.0% recorded in March. The data measures the change in the total value of inflation-adjusted sales at the retail level and is the top indicator of consumer spending, which accounts for the majority of overall economic activity in Japan
However, Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kuroda said the central bank must begin to investigate why Japan's inflation is still sluggish and wage growth is lagging despite years of ultra-loosening monetary policy.
In Australia, the AUD/USD pair lost 0.15% at 0.7494. The Aussie was dragged down by the weaker-than-expected building approvals data that came in at -5.0% rather than the forecast -2.9%. The approvals data measures the change in the number of new building approvals issued by the government and serves as a key indicator of demand in the housing market.
In China, the People's Bank of China set the set the reference rate for the yuan against the dollar, the mid-point from which the currency is allowed to trade, at 6.4207 versus the previous day's 6.4021. The USD/CNY pair gained 0.10% to trade at 6.4255.

Italy faces the prospect of fresh elections, which could deliver a deeply Eurosceptic government, threatening the future of the Eurozone, after proposed prime minister Giuseppe Conte abandoned his mandate to form a government on May 27.
As well as Italian political uncertainty, sentiment on the euro was also soured by fears of elections in Spain as the principal opposition party tabled a motion of no confidence last week against the government in the wake of a large corruption scandal.
“Although it remains to be seen if the motion will pass, political noise could interfere with policymaking, which has already been slow this year,” Action Economics said in its June 2018 Consensus Forecast. .

Socialist President Nicolas Maduro said in March the bolivar currency would be redenominated on June 4, and the central bank has been tweeting pictures of the new banknotes emblazoned with Venezuelan historical figures.
But the banks have not received the new bills and have not had a chance to adjust cash machines for them, according to two finance industry sources.
Opposition critics say Maduro is at risk of repeating the chaos of late 2016, when the government withdrew the largest bill from circulation, sparking long lines, looting and protests that led to at least three deaths.
Maduro, who says the country is the victim of an ""economic war"" led by his political adversaries, blamed the 2016 problems on sabotage by enemies and ultimately postponed the measure.
Businesses ""should take provisions so that the monetary conversion does not affect, slow or suspend customer service, payment or billing,"" the government's consumer protection agency, Sundde, said in a statement. 
The Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Venezuela has annual inflation near 14,000 percent, according to the opposition-controlled legislature, amid a collapse of its socialist economic system that has left millions of people struggling to eat properly.
Cash is increasingly difficult to obtain because new banknotes have not been printed fast enough to keep up with price increases, spurring a growing use of cellular phone apps.
Some stores and bus companies were no longer accepting cash on Monday out of fear the notes would be worthless next week. 
Others worried that problems with cash payments could lead to increased use of the already overloaded digital systems such as bank transfers and debit card payments, potentially crashing bank websites.
""There are rumors that transfers will be impossible for several days and that would be terrible because people pay by electronic transfers,"" said messenger Antoni Zambrano, 22, in Tachira state near the Colombian border.

1034,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Euro's rise halted as Italy faces new elections,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro gave up its early gains and turned negative on Monday after Italy's president set the country on a path to fresh elections, raising concerns that such a route may deliver an even stronger mandate for the country's anti-establishment parties.
President Sergio Mattarella's decision to appoint Carlo Cottarelli to form a stopgap administration sets the stage for elections that are likely to be fought over Italy's role in the European Union and the euro zone, a prospect that is unnerving global financial markets.
After climbing more than half a percent in early London trading to rise to the day's highs of $1.17285, the single currency (EUR=EBS) fell sharply to trade at the day's lows at $1.1647, down 0.1 percent on the day.
""Given the stance towards the euro is the single topic financial markets are most sensitive to, the worries towards Italy are probably only starting to increase in the bigger picture,"" Nordea economist Jan Von Gerich said.
With elections likely to be held in the second half of the year, markets are worried the timing of Italy's elections poses a tricky problem to European Central Bank policymakers who are on track to wind down its bond purchase program by September.
Nordea's Gerich believes the ECB may choose a more cautious alternative and extend its bond purchases beyond that month.
The euro has been weakened by the dollar's rally and by widening bond spreads between Italian and German debt, as markets grappled with the prospects of a spendthrift coalition government in Rome comprising the two parties.
Though investors have initially ignored the impact of the new coalition, the events in the last few days have prompted investors to cut their positions in the single currency.
Latest positioning data shows that net euro long positions are at their lowest levels this year after a fifth consecutive weekly drop in bullish euro bets. 
The euro also strengthened by 0.8 percent against the Swiss franc (EURCHF=EBS), rebounding from near three-month lows, but was had halved those gains in midday European trading.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategists said political uncertainty will remain elevated, because the prospect of new elections would remain a drag on the economy.
The euro's weakness meant that the dollar firmed against a basket of rivals on Friday (DXY) and was trading 0.2 percent up on the day at 94.34 at a fresh six-month high.
Elsewhere, the dollar was flat against the Japanese yen at 109.42 yen . Risk aversion receded after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday a U.S. team had arrived in North Korea to prepare for a summit between him and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Trump had pulled out of the summit last week, which had sapped investor risk appetite and helped push the dollar to a two-week trough of 108.955 yen on Thursday.
Trading volumes were low with Britain and the United States, the two main financial centres for foreign exchange trading, both closed for holidays, thus leading to some exaggerated price moves.

Adding to concerns was news that Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would face a vote of confidence in his leadership on Friday.

1035,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 27, 2018 07:00PM ET</span>",Yuan Gives Comfort to Analysts as China-U.S. Yield Gap Dwindles,"(Bloomberg) -- The China-U.S. yield gap narrowing beyond Yi Gang’s “comfortable"" range will prove no deterrent to further reserve ratio cuts in the world’s second-biggest economy, analysts say.
China’s 10-year bonds yield just 65 basis points more than Treasuries, near the smallest premium since 2016. The People’s Bank of China Governor in April described a 90 basis-point gap as “comfortable"", and noted that an 80-100 basis point spread had persisted between the sovereign curves even as the Federal Reserve raises rates.
That raises the question of whether there’s still room to reduce lenders’ reserve requirement ratios, given the last cut in April spurred the biggest drop in China’s 10-year yield since December 2016. Wang Yifeng, a researcher at China Minsheng Bank in Beijing, says the yuan holds the answer. Its resilience means the PBOC will be relaxed about RRR cuts, he says.
“The expectations on the yuan are relatively stable, even though the China-U.S. yield gap is narrowing,"" said Wang. ""The PBOC might cut RRR more to replace maturities from the medium-term lending facility,"" as financing costs are still rising, he said.
The lack of pressure on the yuan is significant because a continued contraction in the yield spread not only risks eroding demand among foreign investors for China’s fixed income, but could see local capital more interested in heading out. If that’s not happening, officials have more room to focus on tweaking policy to drive money into the real economy.
Yi -- who took office in March as the first new central bank governor in 15 years, and lowered the RRR by a full percentage point soon after -- said last month that China is well prepared for normalization of interest rates around the world.
“We expect the PBOC to cut the ratio by 50 basis points in July and October respectively,"" said David Qu, an economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Shanghai. “The China-U.S. yield gap may narrow further in the long term.""

1036,By Investing.com,"<span>May 27, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",Forex - Weekly Outlook: May 28 - June 1,"Investing.com - Investors will be looking to Friday’s U.S. employment figures for signs of strength in the economy amid an ongoing debate over how many times the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year.
Alongside the jobs data, markets will be focusing on a report on personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation - the Federal Reserve's preferred metric for inflation.
This week's calendar also features the second estimate of GDP growth for the first quarter, which is expected to confirm the economy grew 2.3% in the first three months of the year.
Besides the data, traders will have to navigate other things that worry them in the coming week, such as fresh developments on trade negotiations between the U.S. and China as well as President Donald Trump's planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un slated for next month.
The dollar rose against a basket of peers on Friday to its highest since mid-November, after data showed new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased more than expected in April.
The data suggested that business spending on equipment was picking up after slowing down at the end of the first quarter, boding well for second quarter growth prospects.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was up around 0.5% at 94.21, after hitting a high of 94.24, a level last seen on November 14.
The index has logged weekly gains in five of the last six weeks, boosted by its widening yield advantage over the other major currencies.
Investors have fully priced in a rate rise at the Fed's next policy meeting on June 12-13, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool. However, Wall Street remains divided over how many more time the central bank will raise interest rates after that.
The probability of three more rate hikes by the end of this year, rather than two, decreased after the minutes of the Fed's May meeting released last week were seen as more dovish than markets had expected.
Elsewhere, the euro was on the backfoot, as rising bond yields in Italy triggered nervousness among investors, while brewing political instability in Spain also weighed on sentiment.
The single currency lost around 0.6% against the dollar to end at 1.1650 (EUR/USD), its lowest level since November 13. For the week, it slumped 1.1%, the sixth consecutive week of losses.
Meanwhile, the British pound traded near a five-month low of 1.3300 (GBP/USD) against the dollar on Friday, hindered by worries over Brexit and further signs of sustained weakness in Britain's economy.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of significant events likely to affect the markets.

1040,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",Graphic: Markets see more Turkish lira losses and more cenbank moves to support it,"By Karin Strohecker and Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Turkey's lira is in the grip of one its worst routs of modern times but markets are sensing more weakness ahead and could push authorities to do more than this week's 3 percentage-point rate hike to turn the tide.
Roiled by problematic politics, big deficits and double-digit inflation, the lira is heading for its worst week and month in almost nine years. 
Since the start of the year it has lost 20 percent against the dollar and, as the charts below indicate, pressure points remain.
1/ SCALE OF THE MOVE 
The modern lira's biggest-ever slump was a 36 percent drop over roughly six weeks at the height of the 2008-09 global financial crisis. This current plunge, which really started snowballing last September, now amounts to 31 percent.
If the lira doesn't stage a fightback in coming months, this will be its sixth straight year of losses. It is also the most undervalued of major emerging currencies in real effective exchange rate (REER) terms - which measures it against the currencies of trade partners, adjusted for inflation.
Technically the lira's all-time REER low was in October 2001. Renaissance Capital says this equates to 5.16 per the dollar in today's prices. Before Wednesday's 3 percentage point emergency rate hike, the lira spot rate had been close to crossing the 5-per-dollar threshold.  
""We think Turkey could breach that (5.16 level) if it had a growth and banking crisis,"" said Renaissance's chief economist Charles Robertson.

2/ARE WE NEARLY THERE YET?
Futures, options and derivatives markets are still flashing warning signs for the lira.
The cost of hedging against big lira swings using volatility options  on Friday was moving back toward the 9-year high hit on Wednesday before the central bank jacked up rates. Traders only make money on these if the currency moves by more than the priced level. That points to big moves, though it could be in either direction. 
One-year risk reversals , a gauge of puts (sells) to calls (buys) on lira and a medium-term measure of the currency's outlook, are nearing their highest levels since Jan 2017. 
Shorter-term three-month risk reversals  indicate similar stresses, while one-year forwards  are quoted at a 15 percent premium to the current dollar/lira spot rate.

3/MORE RATE HIKES?
The signals from Turkey's interest rate markets are tricky to decipher with any accuracy in the current maelstrom, but the picture that emerges is that while the scale of Wednesday's rate hike may not be repeated, there will be at least one more tweak. 
Three-month 'forward starting swaps' - an indicator of what money markets expect to be charging for three month-funding in three months time -- are at 17.15 percent -- up a bit on Turkey's top 'late liquidity window' rate after this week's policy tightening .
""It looks like the market is pricing in another 50 basis points hike in the next three months, said  Standard Life  (LON:SLA) Aberdeen fund manager Kieran Curtis. ""So another little tweak.""
This week's move is a reminder too that Turkey is no stranger to emergency rate hikes. It cranked up rates in a midnight emergency meeting in January 2014 after the lira tumbled more than 7 percent in 10 days.
Another option that would be welcomed by markets but is not apparent in pricing would be to pull the three different interest rates closer together. It has long been talked about and would make it easier for the central bank to control the market.

4/ SWAPS SURGE
The rout in the lira has spilled over to the cross-currency basis swap markets - a rough indicator of the availability of U.S. dollar funding in domestic currency markets.
One-year Turkish cross currency swaps - a tool used by financial institutions to offset both exchange rate and interest rate risk - surged to a record of nearly 18 percent this week.  
This is up more than 300 basis points since the start of the month - indicating the rush to secure dollar funds. Having tracked the lira quite closely until May, cross-currency swaps have deteriorated at a faster rate than the lira itself this month.
Cross-currency swaps were in the spotlight during the 2008 global financial crisis and the eurozone crisis when banks used derivatives markets to secure overnight funding if they had been locked-out of the traditional wholesale money markets.

A rise in these swap rates indicate financial institutions are paying a premium to secure dollar funds and translates into increased pressure on the local currency, in this case the lira.

1041,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>","EU may not enforce its rules on Italy, but financial markets will","By Jan Strupczewski
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU officials will probably not do much to enforce their borrowing rules on Italy's new government, but they are hoping they won't have to because financial markets will do the job for them.
A new government is expected to take office in Italy next week, a coalition of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and far-right League, who have jointly promised a bonanza of tax cuts and spending increases that would burst through the EU's limits on borrowing by member states. 
Slovak Finance Minister Peter Kazimir on Thursday called the policy mix a ""suicide mission"". Markets have already responded: yields of the benchmark 10-year Italian bonds have jumped 0.7 percentage point since the start of May to 14-month highs above 2.46 percent.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) warned this week that sustained yields that high could spark contagion by hitting the profits of banks which hold a big chunk of their assets in government debt. Shares in Italian banks hit 11-month lows on Friday, having fallen almost 14 percent so far this month. Economists say that is only a taste of what could come: the rise in rates would be much steeper if markets believed that Italy was actually prepared to go through with the plans.
""If they do what said they want to do, the reaction of the market will be much more than what we have seen so far,"" said Francesco Papadia, a senior fellow at the respected Brussels-based Bruegel think-tank. 
The spread of the Italian benchmark paper over comparable German bonds hit 200 basis points this week, still a far cry from the 550 basis points spread at the peak of the sovereign debt crisis in 2012.
""So far (the market reaction) has been clear, but not extreme. Maybe the market still has a hope they won't do at least the most extreme version of what they said they would do,"" Papadia said.
Italy's increased spending against EU rules ""would likely be met by aggressive Italy underperformance versus other markets"", investment bank J.P. Morgan said in a note for investors.
EU UNLIKELY TO INTERVENE
As an EU member, Italy is obliged seek a balanced budget in structural terms and have debt below 60 percent of gross domestic product. Instead, its structural deficit has been rising since 2015 and its debt has been close to 132 percent of GDP since 2014. But most Brussels-watchers do not expect Europe to take political action to enforce its rules.
The European Commission, the guardian of EU laws, has the task of disciplining profligate governments through what is called an excessive deficit procedure that could end in fines.
But it has repeatedly declared that punishment is not the way to deal with budget rule-breaking, and showed leniency to repeat budget offenders like France, Portugal and Spain.
The Commission is also held back by concern that enforcement action would only strengthen eurosceptic sentiment in Italy, the euro zone's third biggest economy, where many people are already ambivalent about the euro currency.
""In the end, crazy countries are always disciplined by markets. Rules can be broken. But you cannot replace market funding with wishful thinking,"" one senior euro zone policy-maker said, expressing a widely-shared view.
MARKET PRESSURE WOULD HURT VOTERS QUICKLY
League leader Matteo Salvini brushed off market pressure.
""The more they insult us, the more they threaten us, the more they blackmail us, the more desire I have to embark on this challenge,"" he said.
But analysts point out that only 36 percent of Italy's massive 2.4 trillion euro debt is held by foreigners, meaning a fall in asset prices would hit Italians hard.
The rest is held domestically by banks, funds, investment vehicles and individuals, who now benefit from demand created by a European Central Bank bond-buying program. 
The ECB scheme is likely to wind down this year and rate hikes are expected in mid 2019. Faced with profligate policies that undermine Italy's ability to repay debt, foreign investors are likely to sell Italian paper. As yields rise, Italian voters would quickly see the value of their assets shrink.
""In Italy, quite a percentage of bonds is held by families directly. So when people see the statements from their banks on the value of their financial wealth, their savings, they would see the consequences,"" Papadia said.
Another factor likely to limit the Italian government's fiscal plans is the threat of a credit rating downgrade. Italy is now just two notches above junk with a BB from Standard & Poor's and Fitch, and Baa2 from Moody's. Fitch has already said the plans outlined in the coalition agreement would add risk to Italy's fiscal position. 

If Italian debt were to fall below investment grade, its banks would find it much more difficult and costly to get daily liquidity from the ECB -- a constraint that could have serious consequences for the whole sector and the country.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro weakened on Friday and is set for a sixth consecutive week of losses as rising bond yields in Italy triggered nervousness among investors, while brewing political instability in Spain also weighed on sentiment.
The Swedish crown  was the surprise winner among G10 FX currencies in European trade after the country's debt office said it plans to build up a position of up to 7 billion crowns ($803 million) as it reduces its buying of costly foreign currencies.
""Italy is still the focus for financial markets for now with Spanish news playing into the overall theme, though we are a long way from those concerns hitting the macro fundamentals,"" said Lee Hardman, an FX strategist at MUFG in London.
Spain's opposition socialist leader Pedro Sanchez said his party would force a snap election if it wins a no confidence vote against Prime Minister Mariano over a graft case involving members of his conservative People's Party. 
Italian prime minister-designate Giuseppe Conte met the governor of the Bank of Italy on Friday as markets fell on fears the incoming eurosceptic government will embark on a spending spree that will undermine fragile state finances. 
The closely-watched Italy-Germany 10-year bond yield spread, seen by many investors as a proxy for investors' sentiment on the euro zone, widened to 200 basis points (bps) for the first time since June. (IT10YT=RR), (DE10YT=RR). 
Widening spreads have pulled the euro lower against the Swiss franc in recent days, with the franc set to post its fourth consecutive weekly gain against the single currency. On Friday, the euro was down 0.1 percent at 1.1601 francs. (EURCHF=) 
Broader currencies remained in a range with investors digesting news this week including minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting which were perceived to be dovish, and mixed European data with the dollar index (DXY) holding below a December 2017 high of 94.19 hit this week.
""The euro continues to be under pressure especially against the franc as Italian/German spreads are widening but markets are taking a 'wait and see' approach for now,"" said Alvin Tan, an FX strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in London.

Data this week showed the German PMI fell to a 20-month low in May indicating that momentum in Europe's biggest economy was faltering. Minutes of the European Central Bank's April meeting showed policymakers were worried about a more pronounced slowdown in the euro zone and political uncertainty in Italy. and 
SWEDISH SURPRISE
The crown has been one of the currencies most heavily sold in recent months by speculators betting that monetary authorities in Sweden would significantly lag behind their peers in Europe in removing policy support. 
The currency therefore jumped on the news from the Swedish National Debt Office (SNDO).
""The fact that the SNDO is taking a position for a stronger SEK vs EUR is a very good sign for crown bulls,"" Richard Falkhenhall, a Stockholm-based senior FX strategist at SEB said on Twitter.
The crown rallied 1 percent to 10.16 per euro (EURSEK=D3) and by a similar margin against the dollar  at 8.6750. 
The yen and the safe-haven Swiss franc  are set to notch up big weekly gains in response to heightened worries over global politics. However, traders were quick to lock in gains before long weekends in the United States and Britain.

The dollar had been rising for weeks on its widening yield advantage but lost some of its momentum after the Fed minutes on Wednesday were seen as more dovish than markets had expected.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's lira weakened more than 2 percent on Thursday, giving up some of the hefty gains it made after the central bank raised interest rates by 300 basis points on Wednesday in an emergency move to prop up the tumbling currency.
The central bank raised its top interest rate to 16.5 percent from 13.5 percent at an extraordinary meeting prompted by the lira's relentless fall in recent weeks. It had depreciated as much as 23 percent so far this year before the bank's move.
Investors have hammered the currency on concerns about the central bank's ability to tame double-digit inflation, particularly after President Tayyip Erdogan -- a self-described ""enemy of interest rates"" -- said he expected to assert more policy control after June 24 elections.
After the initial bounce following the bank's move -- the currency swung from a 5 percent loss to a more than 2 percent gain -- investors now appear to be concerned whether the rate increase was enough to put the currency on a steady footing.
""It might prove insufficient to stabilize the currency, as concerns about monetary policy-making in the post-election period will remain ... given the President's vow to tighten his grip on economy policy,"" said Gokce Celik, chief economist at QNB Finansbank, in a note to clients.
The lira  was at 4.6880 against the dollar at 0845 GMT, versus its close of 4.5900. It hit a record low of 4.9290 on Wednesday before the rate hike. It is now down some 19 percent year-to-date. 
The yield on Turkish 10-year government bonds (TR10YT=RR) fell to its lowest since May 15. Dollar bonds rose, and the cost of insuring Turkish debt against default fell to a one-week low.
FURTHER TIGHTENING
Some analysts pointed out that the bank, in Wednesday's statement, dropped its usual wording that ""further monetary policy tightening will be delivered, if needed"". That sowed some concern that it may not increase rates at its next scheduled policy meeting, on June 7.
""We will need to see some further tightening in the regular scheduled (monetary policy committee) meeting on June 7 as well,"" said Inan Demir, of Nomura International. ""So that they can increase the real rate and go beyond catching up with inflation and actually move ahead of the curve.""
Following the bank's move, Erdogan said ""financial discipline will continue and the necessary things will be done for financial stability"".
But he also said the currency's volatility did not reflect economic reality and, echoing his frequent references to foreign threats, warned that he would not let ""global governance types"" ruin the country.
Erdogan, an economic populist, wants to see lower borrowing rates to fuel credit growth and new construction. Investors, who fear the economy has overheated after a more than 7 percent expansion last year, want decisive rate hikes to cool inflation.
The president also said in his speech on Wednesday he would look to take action on inflation after the June 24 vote -- although he did not say concretely what that might be.

""We will definitely take measures to lower the inflation and current account deficit in a very different way after the elections,"" Erdogan said.

1048,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2018 09:38AM ET</span>",Swiss vote on radical sovereign money plan to upend banking system,"By John Revill
ZURICH (Reuters) - Jean-Marc Decressonniere is probably the only banker in finance-friendly Switzerland who supports a vote next month that could transform how lenders operate.
Unlike virtually all his peers, Decressonniere backs the Sovereign Money initiative, which wants to stop commercial banks from in effect creating money every time they make a loan.
Supporters say their shake-up will make the financial system safer by ensuring the Swiss National Bank is the only authority permitted to produce new money in Switzerland.
The change would scrap fractional reserve banking, a mainstay of lending around the world, in which only a portion of bank deposits are backed by central bank money: notes, coins and bank deposits held at the SNB.
For a FACTBOX on sovereign money see
Decressonniere, a 48-year-old director of the Freie Gemeinschaftsbank, a small bank in Basel, thinks changing the system would make the financial sector more stable and less prone to boom and busts.
""In future, it would be more sensible to have money administered by a central authority that is independent and looks at the whole economy,"" he said. ""Commercial banks have a more limited perspective based on their own profit targets.""
Around 90 percent of the money in circulation in Switzerland now is electronic money created by commercial banks, a situation which supporters of the campaign say is inherently unstable.
They propose de-risking the system by letting customers lodge their money in risk-free sovereign money accounts. 
Banks in future would be able to lend only money they administer in savings accounts, or what they can get from the money markets or the SNB.
The initiative is opposed by the SNB, whose chairman, Thomas Jordan, says it would damage the central bank's ability to carry out independent monetary policy and subject it to political pressure.
The latest opinion poll showed just 35 percent support for the plan, which is subject to a binding referendum on June 10. But the SNB -- mindful of recent populist uprisings against executive pay and tax reforms -- is taking no chances.
Jordan has fired several broadsides against the initiative, which he has branded a"" dangerous cocktail"" for Switzerland.
Polls have got big decisions wrong in the past, as evidenced by Britain's Brexit vote and Donald Trump's U.S. election win.
But Lukas Golder, co-leader of pollsters GFS Bern, said chances for a sovereign money victory were remote.
""A 'no' result is the probable outcome,"" he said. ""Unlike globalisation or migration issues, there has been no great mobilisation of voters.""
Interest in sovereign money rose following the 2008 financial crisis after the Swiss government had to bail out UBS.
Supporters say that allowing customers sovereign money accounts with the SNB would reduce the risk that bank runs will wreck Switzerland's financial system.
""When you ask most people where their money comes from, they will say it is the SNB, but that's not true,"" said Maurizio Degiacomi, a leader of the campaign by academics and ex-bankers.
""When they learn that the money they use in their daily lives is actually produced by commercial banks, they want this changed.""
The Swiss banking establishment disagrees, saying great strides have been made to improve stability via regulations that make banks hold more capital.
The changes would also lead to an increase in the price of credit and higher banking charges, Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) Chief Economist Martin Hess said. Lenders would have to go to the money markets, other banks or the SNB for funding because they could no longer use customers' current account deposits to finance loans.
In a study commissioned by the SBA, University of Lausanne economist Philippe Bacchetta reckoned a switch to sovereign money could cut Swiss gross domestic product by 0.4 percent.
""This plan has never been attempted anywhere else, and if Switzerland was the only place to do this, it would be really risky,"" said Jean-Charles Rochet, a University of Geneva economist.
The initiative would cause massive disruption to the Swiss banking system. Big banks could move their activities abroad so the regulations don't apply, or might offer only accounts in euro or dollars to get around it, he said.
""It's good to have a discussion, but this is too technical an issue to be decided in a simple yes-no referendum,"" said Rochet.
Still, Freie Gemeinschaftbank's Decressonnière thinks the time is right for a change.
""The other banks have their own interests to defend. Creating money is a privilege the banks have and the big banks profit to a greater extent from this,"" he said.

""It would be painful for them to lose this, so it's understandable why they are against it. But it is very surprising we are the only bank that supports the initiative.""

UK retail sales rose 1.6% in April, compared to expectations for a 0.1% gain, the Office for National Statistics reported. The unexpected increase indicates consumer confidence in the UK economy, despite political uncertainty surrounding Brexit.
GBP/USD surged 0.46% to a one-day high of 1.3410 as of 4:43 AM ET (8:43 GMT).
The euro was also higher, but was held back by economic and political worries in Europe. The Euro Zone Composite Flash Purchasing Managers Index fell to an 18-month low in May, indicating stagnating economic growth. Investors are also concerned by politics in Italy, where anti-establishment 5-Star and far-right League could put eurosceptic officials in power. The EUR/USD rose 0.42% to 1.1744.
Meanwhile, the greenback fell after an unexpected dovish-tone in the latest Federal Reserve meeting minutes.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.30% to 93.63.
Fed meeting notes suggested that while another interest rate hike is warranted, the central bank would accept inflation rising above its target rate for a while.
This was a surprise to investors, who expected that the Fed will increase interest rates and tighten monetary policy in the coming months. The Fed raised rates in March and is expected to raise rates twice more, with a 95% chance of a hike in June.

The euro is set to slump for a sixth consecutive week against the dollar - the longest weekly losing streak since January 2015 - hobbled by worries over an economic slowdown in the currency bloc. 
The euro has also been hit by concerns that an incoming coalition Italian government will implement big-spending policies, adding to the country's large debt. 
""The euro is an important choice in our foreign currency reserves, and so we are continuing to buy European debt,"" Li said.
""Even when certain European countries had sovereign debt crises, China kept the broader picture in mind.""
The premier said a strong euro benefits the Chinese yuan currency. 
""We hope the euro can be strong and steady. We have a large amount of foreign reserves. We believe that foreign exchange reserves can't just be put in one basket,"" he said. 
Li's show of confidence in the euro came as German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited China. 
In a joint media appearance with Merkel at Beijing's Great Hall of the People, Li said China and Germany both upheld global free trade, and stressed the huge potential for cooperation between them.

Without any key economic data in the region, investors focused on political events that clouded the market outlook. As risk appetite soured, the safe-haven yen was sent higher.
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies last stood at 93.78, down 0.14%, at 12:49AM ET (04:49 GMT).  On Wednesday night, the index climbed above the 94 level for the first time this year, reaching 94.10.
The market was also reacting to the outcome of a meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday. The Fed appeared to be content to let inflation run above the 2% target for a “temporary period”, signaling no rush to tighten monetary policy.
The USD/JPY pair slid 0.49% to 109.49 as the U.S. sought to impose more tariffs, reigniting fears of a trade war. The yen surged after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to initiate a probe into automobile imports.
The yen was also affected by the reaction to uncertainty over whether a planned summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un would happen. Doubts over whether the summit will go ahead have destabilized geopolitical relations in Asia.
A top North Korean diplomat criticized U.S. Vice President Mike Pence who suggested that the fate of North Korea follow the Libyan model, prompting the Asian country to say that a “nuclear-to-nuclear showdown is entirely dependent upon the decision and behavior of the United States”. The Libyan model refers to the U.S. approach to that country, which ended with the capture and killing of leader Moammar Gadhafi after operations carried out with NATO support and help.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar lost momentum on Thursday after the double-whammy of dovish-looking minutes of the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting and the threat by U.S. President Donald Trump of imposing new tariffs on imported cars.
The euro was hampered by concerns over an economic slowdown in the currency bloc and political risks in Italy, staying near a six-month low against the dollar and a nine-month nadir versus the yen.
Measured against a basket of six major currencies (DXY) (=USD), the dollar stepped back to 98.865 from its five-month high of 94.195 hit just before the release of the Fed's minutes.
While most policymakers thought it likely another interest rate increase would be warranted - in line with market expectations - the minutes showed the Fed would tolerate inflation rising above its goal for a time.
""The minutes suggested the Fed is not in a hurry to raise interest rates. The U.S. stock markets seem to like that they were not too hawkish,"" said Ayako Sera, market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust bank.
Moreover, the minutes also showed the board members generally agreed to make a small adjustment in its policy implementation by raising the interest rates on its excess reserves by 20 basis points, rather than by a widely anticipated 25 basis points.
Their discussion, while highly technical, came as a surprise to market players and helped bring down short-term U.S. interest rates and bond yields.
""This means the effective interest rates in the future have shifted five basis points lower over a long period of time. In other words, we could even say the Fed today cut rates by five basis points,"" said Toru Yamamoto, chief fixed income strategist at Daiwa Securities. 
The dollar's fall accelerated as Trump appeared to have opened a new front in the trade war by considering new tariffs, this time on cars, just days after Washington agreed with China to put ""on hold"" its plan to impose tariffs on $150 billion worth Chinese goods.
Against the yen, the dollar shed as much as 0.6 percent to 109.45 yen , a day after it had fallen 0.73 percent, its biggest fall in nearly three months. It last stood at 109.61 yen, down 0.4 percent on the day.
The safe-haven Swiss franc also ticked up 0.2 percent to 0.9943 franc to the dollar , helped by investors' cautious mood. It hit a three-week high of 0.9894 per dollar on Wednesday.
The euro bounced back slightly to $1.1705 (EUR=) after hitting a six-month low of $1.1676 on Wednesday but the common currency was held back by economic and political worries in Europe.
IHS Markit's Euro Zone Composite Flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), considered a good guide to the euro zone's economic health, sank in May to an 18-month low, suggesting the continent's strong growth last year has lost steam.
Investors were unnerved by political developments in Italy, where the coalition government proposed by the anti-establishment 5-Star and far-right League could tap eurosceptic economist Paolo Savona as economy minister.
The Italian debt yields have jumped in the past couple of weeks, with the 10-year government bond yield (IT10YT=RR) rising more than 50 basis points.
The common currency was soft against the yen, hitting a nine-month low of 128.24 yen (EURJPY=R) on Wednesday.
""I think there is risk of further downward revision in the European economic outlook. Earlier this year, people thought the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve will all raise interest rates. But now the ECB has clearly dropped out,"" said Kazushige Kaida, head of forex at State Street Bank and Trust in Tokyo.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The Turkish lira tumbled more than 5 percent on Wednesday before recovering some ground, the latest drop in a sell-off that reflects growing investor alarm over the direction of monetary policy under President Tayyip Erdogan.
The decline, exacerbated by stop-loss selling by Japanese retail investors overnight, brings the lira's losses to more than 20 percent so far this year and puts it on track for its worst monthly performance since the 2008 financial crisis.
The sell-off has also increased expectations that the central bank may be forced to call an extraordinary meeting to raise interest rates before its next scheduled policy-setting meeting on June 7, as it has done in previous years.
""We expect the MPC to hold an interim meeting over the coming days to raise interest rates by at least 200bp,"" Jason Tuvey of Capital Economics said in a note to clients.
""If policymakers refrain from tightening monetary policy, the risk of a disorderly adjustment and a sharp economic downturn (possibly recession) will mount.""

""We are bearish on the lira and always have been given its very weak external balances and with macroeconomic policy moving in the wrong direction as well,"" said Kiran Kowshik, emerging markets forex strategist at UniCredit.
A self-described ""enemy of interest rates"", Erdogan wants borrowing costs lowered to spur credit growth and construction, and he said last week he would seek greater control over monetary policy after elections set for June 24.
Economy officials told Reuters the government's economic management team met at the start of this week to discuss potential measures, including possible steps by the central bank. Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek and Central Bank Governor Murat Cetinkaya attended the meeting.
Ratings agencies sounded alarm about monetary policy. S&P Global senior sovereign analyst Frank Gill told Reuters government finances could deteriorate rapidly if authorities failed to stem pressure on the currency and government borrowing costs.
Investors want to see decisive rate increases to rein in double-digit inflation, and Erdogan's comments have reinforced long-standing worries about the central bank's ability to do that.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Swiss franc and the Japanese yen rose against the dollar on Wednesday as a wave of caution swept currency markets a day after U.S. President Donald Trump tempered optimism over progress made in trade talks with China.
Carry trades, where investors borrow in relatively low yielding currencies to invest in higher-yielding ones, came under pressure with the euro/swiss franc (EURCHF=EBS) cross being singled out for special punishment.
While the dollar against a basket of its rivals (DXY) rose 0.2 percent to 93.76, it weakened 0.6 percent and 0.3 percent against the Japanese yen  and Swiss franc  respectively.
Stocks tumbled and the yen gained broadly after Trump said on Tuesday he was not pleased with recent trade talks between the United States and China, the world's two biggest economies.
The euro was also pressured lower by concern over political risk in Italy. The single currency fell to a six-month low after German PMI data fell to a 20-month low indicating that economic momentum in Europe's biggest economy was faltering.
The euro/Swiss franc fell 0.3 percent to 1.1616 francs per euro (EURCHF=EBS), its lowest level since March 23.

""The euro/franc cross encapsulates the growing risk premium that investors are placing on the euro in recent days and we may see further downside for now,"" said Alvin Tan, a currency strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in London.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists said the euro's recent weakness could prompt overseas investors to hedge their bond and equity investments in Europe, which could add further downside pressure on the euro.
The safe-haven yen also rose against other currency crosses and surged against the Turkish lira, amid talk of Japanese retail investors selling the lira as stop-loss levels were hit.
The yen tends to rise in times of market turbulence since Japan is the world's largest creditor nation and traders tend to assume Japanese investors would repatriate funds at times of crisis.
Investors are now looking to the release on Wednesday of the Fed's minutes from its most recent meeting, when it kept interest rates steady.

In its post-meeting statement issued in early May, the Fed also said inflation had ""moved close"" to its target and that ""on a 12-month basis is expected to run near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.""

1059,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 22, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>",Rates Linkup Comes Back to Sting Dollar Bulls as Yields Plateau,"(Bloomberg) -- The dollar’s newly revived correlation with Treasury yields -- a rallying cry of late for greenback bulls -- may be cutting short the currency’s five-week climb.
After its best run in three years, the dollar has retreated from Friday’s closing levels as benchmark 10-year U.S. yields stall out below the more than six-year high set last week. The two assets have been moving more in sync: The 60-day correlation between the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index and 10-year yields is the most positive since January 2017, after spending much of 2018 indicating an inverse relationship.
The upshot is that one of the biggest questions hanging over the FX market -- whether the dollar can extend its unexpected 2018 strength -- may go unresolved until traders figure out the next step for the bond market and the Federal Reserve. For now, at least, that means the dollar rally is at risk, given that the central bank’s tightening path is “priced to perfection,” according to Mazen Issa at TD Securities.
“The support from yields may wane as there is less room to price in more rate hikes,” said Issa, a senior currency strategist.
‘Tipping Point’
The greenback’s “tipping point” could come Wednesday with the minutes from the Fed’s May meeting, according to Issa. He expects the release will contain “dovish undertones.” TD projects two more Fed hikes in 2018, whereas traders have been building bets on three additional increases.
Analysts at Scotiabank say the dollar may yet receive a lifeline this week, in the form of a hefty schedule of Treasury issuance.
Should foreign investors seek to buy into the combined $99 billion of fixed-rate note auctions, which kicked off with a two-year offering Tuesday, that could create a bid for dollars, Scotiabank chief FX strategist Shaun Osborne wrote in a note.
To be sure, rising currency hedging costs may have reduced foreign appetite for U.S. sovereign debt, if data out of Japan in recent months is any guide. Granted, the figures are through March, but they could indicate diminished need to buy dollars from at least one investor base. At Tuesday’s two-year Treasury offering, primary dealers were stuck with the highest share since 2017.
Issuance aside, Scotiabank recommends selling into further greenback gains after the U.S. Dollar Index failed to advance beyond a key Fibonacci retracement level at 94.20 on Monday.
“Price action suggests markets may now start to look to fade USD gains rather than buy into USD dips,” he wrote."

Risk appetite revived as the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies is put “on hold”.
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies last stood at 93.79, up 0.21% at 12:09AM ET (04:09 GMT).  It was the highest level since mid-December last year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar climbed to a five-month peak on Monday as news of a truce between the United States and China on trade tariffs prompted investors to pare back their short positions on the greenback.
Investors have been short the dollar since July last year, but since mid-February, the dollar index has rallied nearly 7 percent. The dollar has been mainly bolstered by generally solid U.S. economic data that has backed the Federal Reserve's tightening stance this year. 
The prospect of a resolution to the U.S.-China trade tension has further added to the dollar's shine.
The two world's largest economies have agreed to drop their tariff threats for now. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said on Sunday the agreement reached by Chinese and American negotiators on Saturday set up a framework for addressing trade imbalances in the future.
""While there have seemingly been few signs of concrete progress in those negotiations, the more constructive tone from the two sides appears to be lending some support to the risk environment,"" said Erik Nelson, currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in New York.
That news also boosted U.S. equities and Treasury yields, underpinning the dollar as a result.
In mid-morning trading, the dollar index (DXY) rose 0.1 percent to 93.748 after earlier hitting a five-month high above 94.
This week, the dollar's fate rests on the Federal Reserve, with several Fed officials speaking this week and the minutes of the U.S. central bank's last monetary policy meeting due out on Wednesday.
""If the minutes take note of inflation creeping higher, it could open the door to faster rate hikes and a stronger dollar,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst, at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.
In other currency pairs, the dollar rose to a four-month high against the yen  at 111.39 and was last at 111.13, up 0.4 percent. The yen has been pressured by recent weaker Japanese data, a U.S.-China trade war truce and elevated U.S. Treasury yields, analysts said.
The euro, meanwhile, was flat against the dollar at $1.1770 , after earlier falling to its lowest since around mid-November. Europe's single currency has been affected by concerns about political uncertainty in Italy.
This week will bring about a further test for stubborn euro bulls with the release of May flash PMI data on Wednesday where markets will be waiting to see whether the first quarter slowdown in Europe has spilled over to the subsequent months.

1068,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 20, 2018 08:00PM ET</span>",Pound Wobbling Near This Year's Lows Faces Brexit to Italy Risks,"(Bloomberg) -- The pound is running into another crucial week as it fumbles around this year’s lowest levels against the dollar for a footing.
With the next round of Brexit talks, key U.K. economic reports and the still-unfolding Italian coalition drama set to converge in the coming days, front-end option volatility in sterling versus the U.S. currency has picked up from a one-month low reached at the start of last week.
What investors are waiting for is to see whether the latest economic figures show any upturn, after a sluggish first three months of the year when the Beast from the East snowstorm swept across the country. That could push higher the odds of an interest-rate increase as early as August by the Bank of England. Nomura International Plc sees room for gains in the U.K. currency versus the euro on any positive data surprises.
“If there is a pickup in retail sales, it will suggest that the impact of the Beast from the East on first-quarter activity could have been significant,” said Jane Foley, head of currency strategy at Rabobank. “This will also be sterling-supportive since it would strengthen the view that the BOE could be primed for an August rate hike.”
Markets pared back bets for policy tightening in August after a downturn in first-quarter data amid a cold snap prompted the central bank to adopt a more cautious stance, causing strategists to turn bearish on the U.K. currency. Money-market pricing currently implies a probability of about 52 percent of an August hike, down from 62 percent before the BOE’s last policy announcement on May 10.
Brexit, Italy
“It would require significantly soft data to see the market change its mind as it’s already pretty downbeat with revisions to growth estimates lower of late,” said Jordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura. “The risk for market positioning is that the data surprises higher given the revisions lower, and we’d expect the pound to outperform against low-yielders such as the euro on the back of it.”
Aside from the data, the U.K. will go into the next round of Brexit talks this week against a backdrop of euro-zone turmoil as Italy’s populist coalition pushes ahead with an agenda that’s at odds with the European Union establishment.
The pound was around $1.3470 on Friday. U.K. government bonds dropped last week, with 10-year yields climbing six basis points to 1.50 percent.
“We’ll be keeping a close watch over politics -- both at home and in Italy,” said Daniela Russell, head of U.K. rates strategy at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA). “So far the rise of political uncertainty in Italy hasn’t prompted a flight to quality, but we’ll be paying close attention to the headlines.”

1070,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 18, 2018 01:00PM ET</span>","What, Me Worry? Argentine Peso's Apparent Calm Masks Volatility","(Bloomberg) -- Chart the closing price of the Argentine peso this week and you’ll see something pretty remarkable: The globe’s worst-performing major currency barely weakened past 25 to the dollar -- the floor that the central bank has vowed to defend.
That doesn’t mean Argentina has won. Peel away a layer to look at intraday price action and a vastly different picture emerges. In fact, the peso has gyrated 5.6 percent this week, hardly a confidence-inspiring performance. The currency’s historic volatility remains the world’s highest over a time horizon stretching from one week to one year.
What does that mean? A couple of things, none of them especially uplifting for South America’s second-largest economy. For one, it suggests there’s still pressure for the peso to extend its 24 percent slide against the dollar this year, even as President Mauricio Macri’s team seeks a stabilizing $30 billion credit line from the International Monetary Fund. That package might need to be as much as $50 to $60 billion to completely alleviate concern, according to Lazard Asset Management’s Denise Simon.
Another, perhaps more troubling conclusion: This isn’t by any means a normal currency market. The peso’s one-month volatility is above 40 percent, more than double that of South Africa’s rand, the runnerup among 31 major developed and emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Few investors, apart from the central bank, appear willing to buy pesos at this point.
Traders say bid-ask spreads are still wide and liquidity has dried up. While few consider the currency to be overvalued by much, not many say it’s cheap, either. Risks abound that the peso will overshoot fair value.
If there’s one silver lining, though, there’s this: So far, no one has dared challenge the central bank’s $5 billion bid that’s kept the peso at 25."

Mexico’s currency could drop 10 percent if the deal is terminated, strategists including Michael Zezas wrote in a note Friday. On the other side of tail risks, if the pact is agreed to and signed this year, they would expect the peso to strengthen about 5 percent.
“FX is the main shock absorber for any change to the Nafta policy framework or to expectations,” the strategists said. Nonetheless, they wrote that while Mexican equities may gain just 2 percent from a deal, they could lose as much as 19 percent if Nafta is scrapped.
The U.S. on Thursday dashed hopes for a quick Nafta deal amid “gaping differences” on a number of topics, after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau York expressed optimism about reaching an agreement soon. If negotiators can’t reach at least a preliminary accord this month, any resolution may be a long way off. The U.S. doesn’t have much time to get a revised deal approved under the current Congress, with mid-term elections on Nov. 6.
Nafta isn’t the only driver for Mexican assets. With a broad consensus in the country that Nafta will either remain the same or get renewed, trade has now moved back to the No.2 investor focus behind the presidential elections set for July 1. The left-wing front-runner, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has an 18 percentage point lead, helping send the peso down 8.7 percent since the end of the first quarter.
As for Canada, while Morgan Stanley sees some downside for the loonie in the short-term after it fell 2.5 percent this year, it says the main consequence of the Nafta deal timeline dragging out into 2019 would be for monetary policy.
“A longer timeline for Nafta settlement would serve to reinforce our expectations for a very shallow and cautious path for rate hikes from the Bank of Canada,” economist Robert Rosener wrote. “The BoC has said that Nafta-related uncertainty is already reducing investment and export growth.”
Morgan Stanley cautions investors not to get complacent about the risks surrounding Nafta, even if the most likely scenarios are fairly benign.
“The only case in which we could potentially see a broader contagion to risky assets is in the low-probability scenario of discussions taking a U-turn and Nafta being terminated,” the strategists wrote. “In this situation, markets could extrapolate the outcome into a harsher and broader U.S. protectionist narrative.”

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's peso stabilized on Thursday as the central bank declined for the second day in a row to support the local currency by selling dollars, indicating its willingness to let the market find its own level under 25 to the U.S. dollar.
The peso, in line with currencies around the region, slipped 0.2 percent to 24.3 per greenback a day after President Mauricio Macri declared the run on the peso to be over and sent an olive branch to the bond market by vowing to speed up his deficit cutting effort. Wall Street applauded the moves.
Wednesday and Thursday were the first trading session since May 9 in which the bank did not sell reserves to prop up the peso, which has weakened about 16 percent this month.
The central bank offered to sell $5 billion at 25 pesos per dollar on Thursday, but the local currency did not approach that level during the session. Chief monetary policymaker Federico Sturzenegger established a floor for the peso on Wednesday when he said 25 to the dollar would be ""out of scale.""
The peso hit a series of all-time lows earlier in the month, forcing the president to request a ""high access stand-by arrangement"" from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last week.
It was one of several moves by Macri to bolster confidence after weeks of volatility sparked by a new tax on foreign investors, weak fundamentals, including 25 percent inflation and worries about financial fallout from a drought that has walloped the harvest of Argentina's main cash crop, soy.
The IMF deal may include tough limits on government spending after what Macri called his ""gradualist"" approach to reform failed to halt the peso's slide.
Earlier this month, the government cut its 2018 fiscal deficit goal to 2.7 percent of gross domestic product from 3.2 percent previously. But that in itself was not enough to keep the peso from tumbling.
'ACCELERATED GRADUALISM'
Rather than opt for full bore budget slashing, Macri was more likely to open a period of ""accelerated gradualism,"" said Alberto Bernal, chief strategist at XP Securities. ""I'm still very bullish on this story,"" he said in an email.
""The main points ahead are the details of the arrangement with the IMF,"" said Gabriel Zelpo, chief economist at local consultancy Elypsis, who estimates the government needs about $33 billion from the multilateral lender over the coming year.
""We estimate that a good arrangement with the IMF should be of about that size,"" Zelpo said. ""Investors are waiting to see how intense the fiscal reduction requirement will be and, most important, what the size of the credit package will be.""
Those details will be ""developed in the coming days,"" an IMF official told reporters in Washington on Thursday. An IMF board meeting on Argentina is scheduled for Friday.
Resorting to the IMF is politically sensitive for Macri, who is expected to run for re-election next year. Many Argentines believe it was IMF policies that set the stage for the country's 2001/02 economic meltdown, which tossed millions of middle class Argentines into poverty.

Protests against Macri's deficit-cutting program and his decision to engage with the IMF are being held daily, blocking streets in capital Buenos Aires.

The rise in bond yields, along with positive economic data and rising inflation, has boosted expectations that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates and tighten monetary policy.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro was headed on Friday for its fifth successive weekly decline versus the dollar, in what would be a first for the currency since 2015, as political uncertainty in Italy continued to worry investors.
The euro has slumped six cents from more than $1.24 in the space of three weeks after a huge dollar rally and amid concerns about the demands of populist parties likely to form Italy's next government.
On Thursday, the far-right League and 5-Star Movement agreed the basis for a governing accord that would slash taxes and ramp up welfare spending.
Ratings agency DBRS warned that the economic proposals of the anti-establishment parties could threaten Italy's sovereign credit rating.
The euro on Friday inched up 0.2 percent to $1.1814 (EUR=EBS). But the currency has fallen nearly 1.2 percent this week and on Wednesday dropped to a five-month low of $1.1763.
""The possibility of a eurosceptic government in Rome is shaking investor confidence... at this point a larger fiscal deficit and greater bond issuance [in Italy] does seem likely,"" said David Madden, a strategist at CMC Markets.
A founding member of the EU and the euro, Italy accounts for 15.4 percent of Eurozone GDP and the parties' hostility toward the European Union stance is the biggest challenge to the bloc since Britain voted to leave two years ago.
Still, some investors have played down the broader impact on the euro and questioned whether the Italian parties will really follow through on such plans.
A powerful rally by the dollar is also hurting the euro.
On Friday the greenback edged higher against the yen and set a fresh four-month high, buoyed by a further rise in U.S. Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) that suggests a an upbeat outlook for the world's largest economy. 
The dollar, which has risen 5 percent since mid-February, touched a high of 111.005 yen on Friday, its strongest level since Jan. 23. 
""Moves in U.S. yields remain the focus. If they rise further the dollar could strengthen on the back of that and pull the dollar higher against the yen,"" said Shinichiro Kadota, senior strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Tokyo
Investors are betting that U.S. interest rates will need to rise further to curb inflation.
That has forced investors who took big positions against the dollar anticipating it would fall in 2018 to rush to unwind and cover their positions, pushing the greenback even higher.
In a note to clients, strategists at Citibank said the current rally in the dollar would not last long.
The U.S. budget deficit, which is projected to balloon to more than $1 trillion in 2019, they said, would contribute to a drop of 5 percent in the dollar index over the next 12 months.
Most emerging market currencies continued to wilt against the surging dollar.

The Indonesian rupiah  weakened half a percent to 14,115, its lowest in more than 2-1/2 years and shrugging off a rate rise by the central bank late on Thursday.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority bought HK$9.5 billion ($1.2 billion) of local dollars overnight, the third-biggest intervention since the defense began last month. The HKMA mopped up HK$1.57 billion on Wednesday. Lower rates than the U.S. have made the Hong Kong dollar an attractive target for shorting.
The de-facto central has now spent $7.95 billion protecting its currency system, which has the effect of tightening liquidity in a city that’s grown fat on ultra-low borrowing costs. The city, which imports U.S. monetary policy, is facing the prospect of significantly higher rates for the first time since the financial crisis.
The three-month borrowing rate is 1.75 percent, near the highest since December 2008, and up from 0.8 percent a year earlier. The Hong Kong dollar was little changed at HK$7.8496 per greenback as of 11:40 a.m. local time.
While rising short-term funding costs have prompted banks to offer deposit rates of as much as 3 percent, there’s been little impact so far on the city’s housing market as lenders hold off raising the prime rate -- which caps mortgages. Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. spent a record $3.2 billion buying a land plot at the city’s old airport site this week, signaling confidence demand will hold up in what’s already the world’s least affordable real estate market.
Still, with the U.S. expected to continue hiking interest rates, pressure on the Hong Kong dollar to weaken past its trading band will continue, prompting more intervention, and thereby draining liquidity further.

The euro has slumped six cents from more than $1.24 in the space of three weeks after a huge dollar rally. Investors are betting that U.S. interest rates will need to rise further to curb inflation while other central banks are postponing monetary tightening.
That has forced investors who took big positions against the dollar anticipating it would fall in 2018 to rush to unwind and cover their positions, pushing the greenback even higher.
Some analysts say the market remains complacent about the possibility of a rising dollar, which also notched up a four-month high against the Japanese yen on Thursday as 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) approached their highest since 2011.
The euro slid 0.2 percent to $1.1787 (EUR=), slightly above the $1.1763 2018 low it hit on Wednesday.
""This sense of a market that is not particularly well prepared for a euro decline is supported by the benign valuations still evident in the pricing of six-month and 12-month implied volatility,"" BNY Mellon analysts said in a note, referring to prices of a measure of expected swings in the value of the euro.
The dollar index rose 0.1 percent to 93.502 (DXY), below its 2018 high of 93.632. 
The euro is also suffering from reports Italy's anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the anti-immigrant League, which are working to draft a coalition program, may ask the European Central Bank to forgive 250 billion euros of debt.
But broader Italian markets held up better on Thursday as investors played down the broader impact on euro zone political stability and questioned whether the Italian parties would really follow through on such plans.
""The sheer outlandishness of some leaked plans helped ease investor concerns a bit. The would-be coalition's denials that leaked draft policies were ever concrete plans also helped smooth markets,"" said Ken Odeluga, an analyst at City Index.
Sterling gave up earlier gains after the UK government dismissed a media report that Britain wanted to stay in the European Union's customs union after Brexit.

The Australian dollar added 0.1 percent to $0.7524  after gaining 0.6 percent overnight, buoyed by a rise in prices of commodities such as copper. Other commodity-linked currencies like the Canadian dollar  also advanced.
Volatile emerging market currencies, the biggest losers from the dollar's recovery, took another beating.
Rising Treasury yields have enhanced the dollar's appeal and raised global borrowing costs. For emerging markets with current account deficits that means higher costs and the risk of fund outflows and their currencies declining further, analysts say.

LONDON (Reuters) - Former Reserve Bank of India chief Raghuram Rajan said on Wednesday he did not intend to apply for the job of Bank of England governor which is due to come vacant next year.
Rajan has been mentioned by analysts as a possible future BoE governor after Mark Carney - who previously headed Canada's central bank - steps down at the end of June 2019.
""I have a very good job at the University of Chicago and I actually am an academic, not a professional central banker. I am very happy where I am,"" Rajan told reporters after an event in London hosted by the U.S. university's Booth School of Business, where he is a finance professor.
""I think I’ve said all I can say. I’m not going to apply for a job anywhere, absolutely.""
Asked what he would do if he were approached to fill the role, Rajan - who was the RBI's governor until September 2016 - said he had answered a similar question.
British finance minister Philip Hammond is expected to name Carney's successor later this year, and said in Washington last month that he would consider candidates from abroad.
Andrew Bailey, a former BoE deputy governor who now heads Britain's Financial Conduct Authority, is seen as the front-runner by many economists in the City of London. 
Aside from current senior BoE staff, other names mentioned include Agustin Carstens, the Mexican who is general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, Minouche Shafik, a former BoE deputy governor who heads the London School of Economics and Shriti Vadera, who chairs Santander UK (MC:SAN).
Rajan is a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and warned of financial imbalances in the run-up to the 2007-08 global crisis.
On Wednesday, he said that banks were now much safer but risk had shifted to other parts of the financial system.
Debt troubles in Argentina were likely to be repeated elsewhere and he highlighted the increased volume of 'covenant-lite' loans compared with before the crisis.
The U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank had probably done too much in the way of asset purchases once the worst of the crisis had passed, Rajan added, and had let governments off the hook in terms of undertaking structural reform and providing fiscal stimulus.
In the ECB's case, asset purchases appeared to have weakened the euro but not boosted real economic activity.

He declined to comment on whether the BoE's 435 billion pound ($587 billion) asset purchases were too much, or if Britain's fiscal austerity since 2010 had been excessive, as he had not studied the British economy in as much depth.

The central bank’s governor will meet Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to local television reports on Wednesday, after Turkey’s president said he plans to take more responsibility for monetary policy following elections next month. The lira has been one of the currencies hardest hit by an emerging-market selloff this year amid concern the nation’s interest rates are too low given a current-account deficit and double-digit inflation.
The central bank “is closely monitoring the unhealthy price formations in the markets. Necessary steps will be taken, also considering the impact of these developments on the inflation outlook,” the Ankara-based monetary authority said in a statement on its website.
“Now we just have to see whether ‘necessary’ is the same to the central bank as it is to the market,” said Henrik Gullberg, a strategist at Nomura International Plc. “The market needs a circuit breaker, that circuit breaker can only be a prohibitively aggressive rate hike.”

1092,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2018 07:02AM ET</span>",Euro slides below $1.18 on Italy debt concerns and dollar jump,"By Tom Finn
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro slumped to a five-month low on Wednesday after reports that a possible future Italian government would seek debt forgiveness from European creditors and as the dollar resumed its month-long and powerful rally.
The euro fell as much as half a percent to $1.1783 (EUR=), its lowest since late December, after reports surfaced that Italy's anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and far-right League plan to ask the ECB to forgive 250 billion euros of debt.
The single currency had initially shrugged off the news from Italy but with the dollar restarting its rally, the euro succumbed to selling pressures. 
""This news from Italy has contributed to the weakening of the euro against the dollar,"" said Alvin Tan, an FX strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
""Once an Italian government is formed the market will be keen to know the details of the fiscal policy. Are they really going to push for this write-off from the ECB? That's the one big question mark,"" he said.
The euro also fell sharply against the safe-haven Swiss franc, to a five-week low of 1.1799 francs. (EURCHF=EBS)
The euro had been a top performer in 2018, with traders betting on prolonged dollar weakness because of the United States' trade and budget deficits and investors expecting to allocate more money to the euro zone as its economy strengthens.
Bets that the Federal Reserve will in fact be an outlier in tightening monetary policy among major central banks and signs the euro zone's economy recovery has peaked has unwound that entire euro strength and the currency is now down 1.8 percent in 2018.
The single currency's decline on Wednesday was helped by a resurgent dollar, which hit a five-month high underpinned by gains in long-term U.S. Treasury yields.
The dollar index versus a basket of six major peers rose 0.3 percent to 93.517 (DXY) after rallying to 93.457 overnight, its highest since Dec. 22.
The U.S. currency has gained since mid-April and clawed back its 2018 losses after a reassessment of the path of U.S. monetary policy versus other countries.
Moves by China and the United States to avoid a full-blown trade war have allowed investors to focus on the yield advantage the United States enjoys over other countries.
The dollar rally stalled last week after weaker-than-expected April U.S. inflation data but was lifted on Tuesday when strong U.S. consumer spending numbers sent 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) surging to a seven-year peak of 3.095 percent. 
""Today could see a repeat of yesterday. Momentum would certainly seem to back a further dollar advance with little to stop U.S. 10-year Treasury yields pushing to 3.20 percent,"" said ING FX strategist Viraj Patel. 
The yen barely budged after data showed Japan's economy contracted for the first time in nine quarters during January-March.
The Australian dollar was up 0.3 percent at $0.7491  after sliding 0.7 percent overnight.

The British pound was weaker at $1.3471  after slipping to $1.3452 on Tuesday, its lowest since December.

1093,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 15, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>","Hands Tied and Swords Bent, Emerging Markets Battle the Dollar","(Bloomberg) -- The selloff in emerging markets that began three weeks ago has a disturbing undertone that makes it more dangerous than the boisterous blowout in late January.
The global “wobble” earlier this year grabbed headlines because it came with a sudden surge in volatility. But it proved to be a flesh wound, as the famed resilience of emerging markets aided a quick rebound in stocks, bonds and currencies. With the U.S. dollar losing its momentum, investors were lured again to carry-trade opportunities.
This time, however, the pain is deeper. The dollar has rallied on 17 of the past 21 days, pushing all developing-nation currencies except the ruble to hand investors negative carry returns this month. Even the mighty South African rand, whose outperformance since December has been the talking point, turned negative-yielding on Tuesday.
But that’s not the ominous undertone. It’s about how the traditional fortifications of emerging markets -- strong oil and commodity prices -- are failing to protect developing-nation currencies from the onslaught of a stronger dollar.
Look at the chart below. In January, developing-nation currencies and commodities fell together and rose back in tandem. But this time, while the Bloomberg Commodity Index is extending gains, currencies have collapsed. This divergence suggests that a strong U.S. dollar is more decisive for risk appetite than commodity prices.
That’s bad news for countries such as South Africa and Russia. The ruble, for instance, is now moving in the opposite direction to oil even though it’s the country’s biggest export earner. Their usual positive correlation was destroyed by a four-day decline in the currency in the wake of enhanced U.S. sanctions.
Risks to the Fore
There’s a big, bellowing elephant in the room. Idiosyncratic risks are becoming more influential in currency moves, contrary to the trend seen for two years since January 2016, when yield-chasing investors helped emerging markets rise above political turbulence and diplomatic rows.
In Russia, it’s the U.S. sanctions that keeps a lid on the ruble. In Turkey, it’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s economic principles that favor fighting inflation with lower interest rates are doing the lira in. Such local factors are gaining more recognition as the dollar continues to strengthen.
For the current selloff to end and emerging markets to regain their carry-trade appeal, three elements must coalesce:
* The dollar must halt its rally* Emerging economies must take a break from self-inflicted political turmoil* Currencies must recapture their positive correlation with commodities, especially oil
The opposite scenario, inevitably, is a massive unwinding of carry positions."

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.43% to 92.95. The greenback hit a fresh high for the year of 93.35.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that retail sales fell 0.3% last month. That missed economists’ forecast for a 0.5% rise but retail sales for March was revised higher to 0.8%.
The retail sales control group – which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP – rose 0.4% meeting economists’ estimates.
Market participants said the upward revision to March retail sales bodes well for U.S. economic growth as it confirmed expectations that weakness seen in first-quarter consumer spending was temporary.
“Overall, these are solid figures, particularly given the upward revision to March, which supports our forecast that consumer spending is accelerating again in the second quarter after a sluggish first quarter,” CIBC said.
The Empire State manufacturing index rose in May, to a reading of 20.1 from 15.8 in April, the New York Fed said Tuesday.
The upbeat outlook on economic growth lifted U.S. bond yields as the 10-year Treasury yield rose to its highest level since July 11, adding to upside momentum in the greenback.
The dollar’s surge higher was also supported by a slump in both the pound and the euro.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar inched up against a basket of currencies on Tuesday from its lowest level in more than a week as hopes for an easing of global trade tensions pushed U.S. bond yields higher.
The dollar's index versus a basket of six major peers rose about 0.1 percent to 92.647 (DXY), pulling up from 92.243 on Monday, which was its lowest level since May 2.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield edged up about 1 basis point in Asian trading to 3.001 percent (US10YT=RR), after rising 2 basis points on Monday.
The benchmark yield was supported by signs of an easing in trade tensions between the United States and China after U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to help Chinese telecoms firm ZTE Corp (HK:0763), which has been penalized for violating U.S. sanctions with Iran.
The dollar, which hit a four-month index high of 93.416 last week, has lost steam after soft April U.S. consumer price data raised doubts as to whether the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates as many as four times in 2018.
But some traders remain upbeat about its near-term outlook.
Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore, said he is comfortable remaining long U.S. dollar, with interest rate differentials still likely to work in its favor.
Innes said he would probably remain dollar positive until there is a wave of positive economic data from countries other than the United States, or until the European Central Bank starts to sound ""overtly hawkish instead of just tentatively"".
The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.1932 (EUR=), but remained below Monday's high of $1.1996, which was the common currency's highest level since May 3.
The euro had briefly strengthened on Monday after European Central Bank policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said that the ECB could give fresh guidance on the timing of its first rate hike as the end of its exceptional bond purchases approaches.
Still, some analysts are skeptical of the dollar's upside potential.
""Higher energy and commodity prices globally as well as tightness in labor markets should feed through to inflation and bring back the case of monetary stimulus removal for other majors at some stage,"" the Maybank analysts wrote in a research note.
""We still look for U.S. dollar gains since mid-April to reverse further,"" they said.
Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.1 percent to 109.72 .

""Presidential statements say the necessary steps will be taken in monetary policy and this stress is important,"" the banker added.
At 0806 GMT, the lira  stood at 4.3270 against the U.S. currency, weaker than a close of 4.3088 on Friday but off an early morning low of 4.3502. Last week it touched a record low of 4.3780.
The lira slid again on Friday after Erdogan called for lower interest rates, calling them the ""mother and father of all evil"".
The current account deficit is one of the main worries for investors, although the market showed little reaction to it widening to $4.812 billion in March from $4.5 billion a month earlier. It exceeded a poll forecast of $4.125 billion.
The other major economic concern is inflation, which stood at 10.85 percent year-on-year in April, far above the bank's target of 5 percent.
Erdogan spoke again about interest rates at the weekend before departing on a visit to Britain, when asked about the outlook for rates.
""After June 24, the shape and the level of them will develop in a very different way,"" he said.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond (TR10YT=RR) was at 13.86 percent, up from 13.59 percent on Friday.

1102,By Investing.com,"<span>May 14, 2018 03:42AM ET</span>","Forex - Dollar Slides Lower, Euro Regains Ground","Investing.com - The dollar edged lower against a basket of the other major currencies on Monday after its recent rally to multi-month highs stalled amid diminished expectations for an aggressive pace of monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve this year.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.23% at 92.23 by 03:42 AM ET (07:42 AM GMT).
The index hit four-and-a-half month highs of 93.26 on Wednesday before retreating, to end the week almost unchanged, snapping three straight weeks of gains.
The rally in the dollar lost momentum after tame U.S. inflation data tempered expectations for a faster pace of rate hikes by the Fed.
The Fed raised rates in March and projected two more rate hikes this year, although many investors had seen three hikes as possible.
Earlier Monday, Cleveland Fed head Loretta Mester reiterated her support for gradual rate hikes given that inflation has not yet reached the U.S. central bank's 2% target in a sustained way.
The euro moved higher, with EUR/USD rising 0.26% to 1.1972, having recovered from last week’s lows of 1.1821, a level not seen since late December.
The dollar edged higher against the yen, with USD/JPY inching up 0.12% to 109.53.
The pound gained ground, with GBP/USD climbing 0.24% to 1.3576.
Sterling hit four month lows against the dollar on Thursday after the Bank of England left interest rates on hold as expected, but its cut growth and inflation forecasts for this year and next.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar was higher, with AUD/USD up 0.16% to 0.7553, extending its recovery from the eleven month lows of 0.7411 reached last week.
The New Zealand dollar remained on the back foot, with NZD/USD slipping 0.19% to 0.6952, holding above the five month low of 0.6901 reached on Thursday after the country’s central bank left rates on hold and said the next move in rates could just as easily be a cut as a hike."
1103,By Investing.com,"<span>May 13, 2018 11:13PM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar Drops Amid Sagging U.S. Yields,"Investing.com - The dollar opened the week slipping against the other major currencies on Monday morning in Asia amid sagging U.S. 10-year Treasury yields. Markets also set eyes on the U.S. retail sales data on Tuesday and Japan’s GDP on Wednesday to look for more directional drivers.
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies last stood at 92.28, down 0.17% at 11:10AM ET (03:10 GMT). The greenback reached this year’s new high last Wednesday at 93.22, then lost its rally to drop to the 92 level on Monday. Its uptrend since mid-April is still intact, however.
Last Friday, the U.S. released softer than expected consumer inflation data that curbed expectations for a third rate hike by the Federal Reserve later this year. The news pressured United States 10-Year that had risen to above the 3% last week, widening the interest rate gap between the U.S. and other countries. However, with the yields dropping to 2.96%, the dollar also lost the support.
The USD/JPY pair lost 0.09% at 109.30. Investors will have more cues for the yen following Japan’s GDP on Wednesday and CPI data on Friday.
The AUD/USD pair added 0.24% to trade at 0.7560. The Reserve Bank of Australia will release its meeting minutes on Tuesday, but markets expect little to be changed as the bank has held on its dovish stance given Australian economic data continues to miss expectations.
In China, the People's Bank of China set the set the reference rate for the yuan against the dollar, the mid-point from which the currency is allowed to trade, at 6.3345 versus the previous day's 6.3524. The USD/CNY pair gained 0.06% to trade at 6.3379.

The ringgit  weakened as much as 0.9 percent to 3.985 versus the dollar on Monday, as traders came to grips with the election defeat of the coalition that had ruled the country for six decades. 

The Malaysian stock exchange last week extended trading holidays to Thursday and Friday after the government declared them public holidays following the election results.

1105,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2018 09:00PM ET</span>",Ringgit Drops by Most in 18 Months After Mahathir's Surprise Win,"(Bloomberg) -- Malaysia’s ringgit declined as markets reopened after former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad led the opposition coalition to a surprise election victory, raising concerns over campaign promises to drop a consumption tax and bring back fuel subsidies.
The currency slipped as much as 0.9 percent, the most since November 2016, to 3.9870 at 8:49 a.m. local time. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings have warned of risks to the budget if the goods and services tax is abolished and not offset by other revenue-raising measures.
“The key level to watch would still be 4.00,” said Mingze Wu, an FX trader at INTL FCStone in Singapore. “Mahathir said that they will step in if there’s market disorder, hence this stabilized the market somewhat. The only way to calm investors would be to have the new economic road map.”
Mahathir has sought to reassure the markets by appointing a finance minister seen as a safe pair of hands, while saying he would lead a business-friendly administration. While some, including CIMB Group Chairman Nazir Razak, have expressed optimism following the election, other analysts said stocks and the ringgit may decline in the short term until there’s clarity on policies.
“The appointment of Lim Guan Eng as the minister of finance, as well as the formation of the Council of Elders comprising eminent Malaysians to provide advice to the new government was well received in Malaysia,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore. “While there will be near-term uncertainty over the fiscal impact of the new government’s policies, especially abolishing GST and reintroducing targeted fuel subsidies, higher oil prices will provide a boost to government revenues.”
The opposition victory places the nation in uncharted territory, with an untried government. The Pakatan Harapan coalition had campaigned on a promise to scrap a consumption tax within its first 100 days in power, reintroduce gasoline subsidies and review toll road concessions. In a Thursday press conference, Mahathir emphasized his focus on expanding the economy and reducing debt.
Malaysian stocks had risen to a record close in April as global funds invested more than $600 million into local equities this year. The ringgit has benefited from a recovery in crude prices and was the Asia’s best performer over the past year before trading was suspended for the election.
Market watchers expect equities to fall across the board when the stock market reopens, with government-linked companies, benchmark index stocks and infrastructure companies taking the brunt of a selloff. iShares MSCI Malaysia ETF, the biggest exchange-traded fund holding Malaysian stocks, fell 6.2 percent last week. The FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index has corrected by 2.6 percent after it reached a record on April 19.
“Outcome for GE14 is unprecedented and unexpected,” Suhaimi Ilias, an analyst at Maybank Investment Bank wrote in a report dated May 11. “As investors do not like uncertainties, we can expect some sell-off in Malaysia equities.”
Affin Hwang Asset Management Bhd. is expecting a decline of as much as 8 percent in the first few days of trading post-election, while CGS-CIMB Securities lowered its end-2018 target for the benchmark index. UOB Kay Hian Holdings Ltd. and Nomura Holdings Inc. are reviewing their views on the main measure and equities. On the flip side, Malayan Banking Bhd. has expressed optimism for financial markets following the election.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro headed for a third successive day of gains on Monday as a weak dollar helped the single currency recoup losses, as investors kept a wary eye on political events in Italy.
Italy's anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the far-right League, both hostile to EU budget rules, spent the weekend in talks to forge a common policy program. The parties were adversaries as recently as March but now look likely to form Italy's next government.
The euro (EUR=) was 0.3 percent higher at $1.1972, having fallen last week to $1.1823, its weakest since Dec. 22.
""Italian politics aren't a major moving factor in the euro zone yet. It's not an existential threat and isn't driving a lot of positioning or putting the euro's bounce at risk,"" said Manuel Oliveri, an FX strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London.
""I expect inflation will rebound in the euro zone and that will keep the European Central Bank's stimulus unwinding on track.""
The dollar retreated further from a 2018 peak hit last week as traders booked gains on its recent run-up, spurred by the widening interest rate gaps in favor of the United States. 
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies (DXY) was down 0.1 percent at 92.515.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) strategists said the main catalyst for the dollar's surge was the lack of improvement in euro zone economic data, prompting investors to unwind record short-dollar bets, particularly against emerging market currencies.
A loss of economic momentum in Europe has made policymakers in Europe and Britain more cautious about ending financial crisis-era policies.
On Friday, ECB President Mario Draghi said the euro zone needed a new ""fiscal instrument"" to help weaker member nations if they were being overly penalized by investors during a debt crisis.
Traders pushed out expectations of a rate hike in Britain to end-2018, and the European Central Bank boosting interest rates to the second half of 2019.
Analysts at ACLS said they expected a reduction in trade tensions between the U.S. and China this week to fuel risk-on sentiment that would be positive for the Australian dollar and negative for the yen, considered a safe-haven currency.
The Australian dollar was 0.2 percent higher at $0.7558  after rallying back from an 11-month low of $0.7413 plumbed on Wednesday.

Investors this week are focused on speeches by Fed and ECB officials, as well as German GDP data due out on Tuesday and expected to show some slowdown in growth.

The dollar slid lower against a currency basket for a third day on Friday as investors locked in profits after the U.S. currency hit its highest levels of the year earlier in the week, boosted by expectations for higher interest rates.

The rally in the dollar lost momentum after tame U.S. inflation data on Thursday tempered expectations for a more aggressive pace of monetary tightening by the Fed.

The euro was higher for a second day, with EUR/USD climbing 0.22% to 1.1941. The single currency still ended the week down 0.12% against the dollar.
The euro has come under pressure after data pointing to a loss of economic momentum in the euro area since the start of the year prompted investors to push back expectations on how soon the European Central Bank will wind up its stimulus program.
On Friday, ECB President Mario Draghi said the euro zone needs a new “fiscal instrument” to help weaker member nations if they are being overly penalized by investors during a debt crisis.
The dollar was little changed against the yen late Friday, with USD/JPY last at 109.39, for a weekly gain of 0.23%.

1110,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2018 03:10AM ET</span>","Australian, NZ dollars seen moving down but still in narrow band over a year: Reuters poll","By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Foreign exchange traders recalibrated their expectations downwards for the Australian and New Zealand dollars after steep losses recently, but the two are still seen trapped in a narrow trading band over one year, a Reuters poll showed.
The survey of 38-45 analysts plotted an uneventful future for the Australian dollar, which is seen at $0.7600 in one-month, $0.7663 in three months, $0.7700 in six months and $0.7800 over a one-year horizon.
That is lower than previous expectations the currency would touch $0.7800 in three months and $0.7900 in 12 months.
The Aussie fell for a third straight month in April and was last at $0.7532. It is now on track for a fourth straight weekly loss as the U.S. dollar has pulled up on stronger-than-forecast economic indicators in recent weeks. 
The continuing trade war rhetoric between China and the United States after U.S. President Donald Trump announced import duties on Chinese goods is also weighing on the antipodean currencies.
Trump's move was met with tit-for-tat measures by China, spooking investors who fear the deepening row could derail global growth momentum.
A trade war is particularly bad for open, export-dependent economies of Australia and New Zealand which are heavily reliant on China to buy their wares. 
The uncertainty might explain the wide range in the forecasts from as low as $0.6600 and as high as $0.8600 for the Aussie on a one-year horizon.
Easy monetary policies in Australia and New Zealand at a tine when the U.S. Federal Reserve is on a tightening path further adds to the bearish case for the antipodeans.
""While the level of (global) growth remains positive, it is moderating and we think this will persist,"" said Daniel Been, head of forex research at ANZ, which sees the Aussie at $0.7000 in 12 months.
""With the domestic stories in both Australia and New Zealand well understood and well priced, the global picture is likely to be a key determinant of performance,"" he said.
""The combination of lower growth and tighter liquidity is likely to weigh - the question is how much."" 
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has left rates at a record low 1.50 percent since August 2016 and has given a clear signal that policy will remain easy for a while yet. 
The story is not a lot different in New Zealand where the country's central bank held rates at an all-time low 1.75 percent this week. 
Analysts polled by Reuters predicted small future moves for the kiwi, which currently sits at $0.6973.
The median forecast put the currency at $0.7076 in one month, $0.7017 in three months, $0.7100 in six months, ticking up to $0.7250 in one year.
Again, that is lower than the April poll when analysts had seen the kiwi at $0.7200 in three months and $0.7400 over a 12-month horizon.
While the median forecasts were narrowly spread, there was far more variety at the extremes, with the highest prediction for 12-months out at $0.8000 and the lowest at $0.6000.

1111,By Investing.com,"<span>May 10, 2018 11:13PM ET</span>",Forex – Dollar Little Changed After Soft Inflation Data,"Investing.com –  The dollar retreated from this year’s high after the U.S. released soft CPI data, but rose slightly against the other major currencies on Friday in Asia as sentiment picked up as investors trimmed expectations for four rate hikes after the slower-than-expected inflation report showed prices pressures remained weak.
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies last stood at 92.59, up 0.01% at 11:10AM ET (03:10 GMT). 
The greenback reached this year’s new high on Wednesday at 93.22, then continued to slip back on Friday to trade below the 93 level. Its uptrend since mid-April is still intact, however.
The U.S. Labor Department said on Thursday its consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.2% last month missing expectations for a 0.3% rise. While year-on-year the CPI rose 2.1% in April, also missed economists’ forecast.
The CPI measures the change in the price of goods and services from the perspective of the consumer. It is a key way to measure changes in purchasing trends and inflation. The data showed further evidence of a slowdown in inflation and signaled a lower outlook for Federal Reserve to add another rate hike in the future.
The USD/JPY pair added 0.07% at 109.47. Japan saw a light week of data this week but will release its GDP figures next Wednesday.
In China, the People's Bank of China set the set the reference rate for the yuan against the dollar, the mid-point from which the currency is allowed to trade, at 6.3524versus the previous day's 6.3768. The USD/CNY pair slid 0.04% to trade at 6.3463.

1112,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 10, 2018 10:30PM ET</span>",Mahathir's Surprise Return to Test Ringgit Traders' Resolve,"(Bloomberg) -- The surprise comeback of Malaysian leader Mahathir Mohamad, who once imposed capital controls, is likely to halt a rally in Asia’s best-performing currency amid concerns pro-growth reforms will give way to populist campaign promises.
The ringgit may initially slide to the psychological level of 4 per dollar, although the size of its decline will depend on the level of clarity about the new policies, according to Bank of Singapore.  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV cut its year-end forecast to 4.05 from 3.84 after the vote, citing political uncertainty.
“The first significant resistance is at four,” said Sim Moh Siong, a currency strategist at Bank of Singapore. “We’ll need to see how smooth the power transition is given that this result is historic in nature. Following the transition, we also need to see how the government reconciles the key policy differences.”
The ringgit closed at 3.9497 on Tuesday after dropping to an almost four-month low of 3.9507 earlier that day. Trading in one-month non-deliverable forwards on Friday imply the currency will be 1.5 percent weaker when onshore markets reopen on Monday. It is still Asia’s best performer over the past year, rising 10 percent.
The currency’s immediate future looks bleak due to concern the new government will roll back recent financial reforms, namely replacing the consumption tax with a sales levy and reintroducing fuel subsidies. Most investors had expected former Prime Minister Najib Razak would retain power, ensuring a continuation of policies that had propelled growth to the fastest in three years.
Mahathir sought to reassure investors Thursday as he pledged to focus on growing the economy and lead a business-friendly administration.
“Our concern over the economy is the main thing,” Mahathir told reporters after he was sworn in as prime minister. “We would like to tell the business people to push up the value of the stock market. And on the currency, there is no cause to devalue the ringgit. We should ensure this.”
Currency Peg
Mahathir is known for his criticism of foreign exchange traders and his imposition of capital controls during the Asian financial crisis. In late 1998, he introduced a currency peg after the ringgit plummeted and reserves dwindled. In a sign he remains wary of financial markets, he said in an interview with Bloomberg on April 6 that he’s willing to implement a peg on the ringgit to ward off “currency manipulators”.
While investors, including those at Fidelity International, don’t expect the return of his past policies, there are concerns that implementation of the campaign pledges would widen the nation’s budget deficit, which has been brought down gradually to 3 percent of GDP. Moody’s Investors Service said Thursday that those promises, if carried through without adjustments, would be credit negative for the nation’s bonds.
“A scenario where the fiscal deficit significantly widens would represent a major headwind for the MYR and government bonds” given where the current account is at,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts Jesper Rooth and Chun Him Cheung wrote in a report.
Crowded Positions
The uncertainty may lead some funds to trim holdings given that positioning in both the currency and the debt have become “relatively crowded,” they wrote.
“An initial negative market reaction to the surprising election results seems probable,” Prakash Sakpal, an Asian economist at ING in Singapore, wrote in a research note. Lingering political and economic risks “will weigh on investor confidence and performance of local markets, especially the ringgit for some time, probably through the end of this year.”
Technical analysis suggests the ringgit is likely to extend recent declines until it reaches initial support at 4.01, the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of its advance from January 2017 to April 2018. Beyond that, the currency is also likely to be supported between 4.0155 and 4.0278, the lows set on Jan. 3, 4 and 10.
Not everyone is negative.
“Back in the day, Mahathir was a pragmatic person and is less likely to completely close the economy,” Bryan Collins, head of Asian fixed income at Fidelity International, said in a statement Thursday. “Inflation dynamics in the near term support lower rates for longer, so we would look into buying back our short local rates positions. The ringgit is more volatile to these uncertainties, but a lot of speculative positioning has eroded away.""

1113,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2018 11:24PM ET</span>",Dollar steps back from 2018 peak on softer US inflation,"By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar hovered below a 4-1/2-month high against a basket of major currencies on Friday after tepid U.S. inflation data prompted traders to pare bets of faster rate hikes.
U.S. consumer prices rose less than expected in April, which would support gradual, rather than more aggressive, rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
""Given recent rises in oil prices, a weaker dollar earlier this year, and U.S. tax cuts, markets were clearly worried more about upside risks in inflation,"" said Minori Uchida, chief currency strategist at MUFG Bank.
The so-called core CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy components, rose 0.1 percent from previous month, compared to economists' median forecast of 0.2 percent rise.
It lodged a year-on-year rise of 2.1 percent, matching March's increase.
The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies stepped back to 92.71 from Wednesday's 4-1/2-month high of 93.42.
On the week, it was up 0.1 percent, the fourth straight week of gains if sustained by the end of the day. 
While dollar bulls expect U.S. yield advantages to underpin the dollar in the near term, others say its rally appeared to be running out of steam.
The euro jumped back to $1.1915 from Wednesday's 4- 1/2-month low of $1.1823. 
The single currency has so far weathered the impact from rises in Italian bond yields on signs the country's two anti-establishment parties could sweep into power as they made ""significant steps"" towards forming a government.
While that would end almost 10 weeks of political stalemate after an inconclusive election on March 4, investors cast a wary eye on a coalition of the 5-Star Movement and far-right League, which are hostile to European Union budget restrictions.
Against the yen, the common currency rose to 130.38 yen, extending its recovery from its six-week low of 129.24 yen set on Tuesday.
The dollar eased to 109.40 yen from Thursday's high of 110.02 yen and off its three-month top of 110.05 yen touched on May 2.
The Australian dollar, which had been hit by the loss of its long-cherished status as the highest yielding currency in the developed world as U.S. rates have risen, bounced back to $0.7532 from Wednesday's 11-month low of $0.7413
The New Zealand dollar also bounced back from Thursday's five-month low of $0.6903 following a dovish tone from the country's central bank. It last stood at $0.6962.
The British pound had less luck, falling to $1.3460 on Thursday, its lowest levels in four months, after the Bank of England reduced its growth and inflation outlook for 2018 and 2019 while keeping rates steady as expected.
It was last fetching $1.3528.
The dollar's retreat should take the heat off some of emerging market currencies, which have been hit by worries about capital outflows to U.S, where yields are increasingly becoming attractive.
The Turkish lira stood at 4.2360 to the dollar, off its record low of 4.3780 hit on Wednesday.
The Malaysian ringgit steadied at around 4.0600 per dollar in the offshore forward market, off a near six-month low of 4.1350 touched on Thursday. 
The initial ringgit losses came amid some uncertainty after Mahathir Mohamad scored a stunning election win, defeating the coalition that has ruled the nation for six decades since independence from Britain.
The Argentine peso, the most battered currency among all, as the country seeks financial help from International Monetary Fund, also stabilized on Thursday.

Indonesia Has `Very Good' Buffer, BofAML Says","(Bloomberg) -- Bank Indonesia has a $22 billion buffer for defending the rupiah before alarm bells ring about its foreign reserves, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
Foreign reserves would need to drop to $110 billion, from the $124.9 billion recorded at the end of April, to signal an “aggressive and persistent depletion,” said Singapore-based strategist Rohit Garg. That’s unlikely to happen based on recent history, he said. On top of that, Bank Indonesia closed its forward books recently, giving it another $7 billion, he said.
“History suggests that no matter how violent the selloff has been, even if it’s 2013 or 2015, the outflows have never been really all that aggressive,” Garg said. “We are seeing stress right now in the rupiah and the bonds, but Indonesia’s buffers are still very, very good.”
The emerging market slump triggered last month by benchmark Treasury yields touching a four-year high is drawing comparisons with the 2013 taper tantrum, and dividing investors over the extent of the selldown. Analysts, including those at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., are increasingly predicting that Bank Indonesia will raise rates to defend a currency that has dropped to a 2015 low.
The rupiah has weakened 2.3 percent against the dollar this quarter and fell below the psychological 14,000 level on Monday. Bank Indonesia is preparing monetary measures, including adjusting its policy rate, to stabilize its markets, Governor Agus Martowardojo said Wednesday.
Global funds have sold a net $2.7 billion of Indonesian equities this year. They dumped $1.5 billion worth of bonds in the second quarter, paring the net inflow for 2018 to $202 million.
“Now that foreigners are not buying bonds, that’s going to create a wider supply-demand gap,” said Garg. Demand from local pension funds and insurance companies will probably pick up in coming weeks and fill the gap given the higher yields, he said.

In comments to lawmakers on Tuesday after his inauguration for a record fourth term as president, Putin said a “break” from the U.S. currency is necessary to bolster Russia’s “economic sovereignty,” especially in light of recent penalties and what he called politically motivated restrictions on trade.
“The whole world can see that the dollar’s monopoly is precarious and dangerous for many,” he said. “Our gold and currency reserves are being diversified, and we’ll continue to do that further.”
The numbers tell a different story. According to the central bank’s latest data, the dollar’s share in its international reserves climbed to nearly 46 percent in 2017 from just over 40 percent the previous year. Meanwhile, the euro accounted for almost 22 percent, sliding from more than 32 percent in 2016 and as high as 43.8 percent in 2009. The stockpile was at $459.9 billion in April, the highest since 2014.
Putin doesn’t have much to show for years of decrying the “dollar monopoly” that allows the U.S. to act like a “parasite” on the global economy. Now he has to contend with a deepening standoff with the U.S. after the latest round of sanctions in April ripped through Russia’s currency and stocks and cut off a major company’s access to Western financial markets.
Iran’s experience doesn’t set a very good precedent. While it’s curbed its dollar usage and now receives payment for most oil sales in euros, that doesn’t offer much protection after President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. from the nuclear deal.
Putin acknowledged this week that since oil trades in dollars, “we are thinking of what needs to be done to free ourselves from that burden.”
When it comes to diversifying Russia’s reserves, Putin did have a point. In recent years, the central bank added holdings of yuan as well as Canadian and Australian dollars, which together made up almost 7 percent of the total at the end of last year. It’s also been buying gold, bringing its fraction to over 17 percent in 2017.
What’s more, the dollar’s share in the global reserves is still far ahead of Russia’s at almost 63 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, according to the International Monetary Fund. The euro accounted for about 20 percent, a level that may not be too far off for Russia."

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.36% to 92.62.
The Labor Department said on Thursday its Consumer Price index  rose 0.2% last month missing expectations for a 0.3% rise. While year-on-year the CPI rose 2.1% in April missing economists’ forecast.
Some analysts said the timid inflation report was not bearish enough to derail a Federal Reserve rate hike. But it would likely scale back expectations for the Federal Reserve to add another rate hike to its currently projected two rate hikes.
CIBC said the “the Fed is still likely to pull the trigger on another rate hike in June,” and added that weaker inflation data “tilt the odds in favor of two more rate hikes this year rather than the three some Fed officials have been suggesting.”
GBP/USD fell sharply before recovering some losses to trade at $1.3504, down 0.32%, after the Bank of England, as expected, revealed an unchanged decision on interest rates but slashed its forecasts for growth.

The ruble was the biggest gainer in the world on Thursday as it played catch-up with Brent crude’s surge above $77 a barrel following a national holiday. Oil had lost so much force as a driver for the currency that the 60-day correlation between the two assets has dropped to almost zero.
Thursday’s rally doesn’t necessarily mean the historic bond between the ruble and oil is making a more permanent come-back though. Investors are still wary of piling back into the ruble after being caught out holding overweight positions when the U.S. extended sanctions last month, and a recent rally in the dollar is keeping all developing-nation currencies in check.
Russia’s government also has a policy of buying foreign currency for its sovereign wealth fund when oil is above $40, which shields the exchange rate from excessive strength.
Yerlan Syzdykov, co-head of EM fixed income at Amundi SA, said in a research note last week that while fundamentals “look solid” for the ruble, it will remain a shock absorber of political risk, putting fair value at 61-62 versus the dollar. Thursday’s 2.3 percent jump took the currency to 61.75.
“We are witnessing a modest respite for emerging currencies following the recent rout,” Piotr Matys, a strategist at Rabobank in London, said on Thursday. “The ruble and its EM peers should struggle to regain their bullish momentum.”

1118,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>",No relief yet for emerging currencies against dollar,"By Karin Strohecker and Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - Emerging currencies are suffering their sixth straight week of losses against the resurgent dollar but options markets appear to indicate there is going to be no relief for some of them in the short-term.
Turkey and Argentina are squarely at the center of the rout, with the latter now seeking assistance from the International Monetary Fund. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday convened an emergency meeting with economic advisors to discuss the battered lira.
Investors picking through the debris are trying to predict where emerging currencies will be heading next. Below are three charts showing the possible pressure points:
1/ TURN UP THE VOL
One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected swings in a currency, has crept up across many key emerging currencies. Worst hit is Turkey <TRY1MO=> where ""vol"" has surged above 15 -- beyond levels hit during the May 2013 sell-off that has come to be known as the taper tantrum.
This effectively predicts a swing of some 15 percent in the lira, which is undermined by a large current account deficit, high inflation and overly loose monetary policy.
""The nicest period for emerging markets FX is behind us,"" said Andreas Koenig, head of global FX for Amundi Asset Management.
""We see the Goldilocks situation going away and it is a good reason for higher volatility, and higher volatility is always in a bit of a risk-off environment.""
Implied vol has also risen on other vulnerable emerging currencies such as South Africa's rand <ZAR1MO=>, while Indonesia's <IDR1MO=> implied volatility is at its highest in more than a year.
On most other emerging currencies, however, vol remains lower than during February's equity shakeout. Some analysts attributed this to a belief among investors that the dollar's rally could soon run out of steam.
""Other than Turkey, if you look at implied vols in other EMs it's fairly relaxed. To me it indicates people are skeptical about the potential for much more dollar appreciation,"" said Peter Kinsella, a strategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

2/ UP UP AND AWAY FOR DOLLAR SHORTS?
Emerging currencies indexes (MIEM00000CUS) scaled peak after peak for much of the first quarter but since mid-April the direction of travel has been south.
The main reason is investors taking off bets on a weaker dollar. These ""short"" positions had built up to a record high by end-March, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and are now being unwound.
""A first negative feedback loop has kicked in,"" Holger Schmieding at Berenberg wrote in a note to clients.
""As investors shy away from some risks, the more vulnerable emerging markets are feeling the pinch from higher U.S. interest rates and a stronger U.S. dollar.""
Dollar shorts vs EM longs: https://reut.rs/2ItqUOY
3/ REVERSE GEAR
CFTC data shows short-dollar bets still remain sizeable, and are likely to be unwound further. As a result, the bias is still for dollar strength against emerging currencies, options show.
One-month risk reversals, a gauge of demand for options on a currency rising or falling against the dollar, are up sharply for both Turkey's lira and Indonesia's rupiah over the past 10 days <TRY1MRR=> <IDR1MRR=>.
They remain off February levels, however, and reversals on other currencies such as Brazil's real and the Russian rouble have barely budged.
Amundi's Koenig sees no evidence yet of a huge exodus from emerging equities or debt, but said investors' first move usually is to hedge currency exposure. That would lead to a greater bias for dollar buying.
""After collecting EM assets and risks for years, investors are starting to reduce those risks. I would say it has further to go,"" Koenig added.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.52% to 92.47 by 09:01 AM ET (13:01 GMT), pulling away from Wednesday’s four-and-a-half month high of 93.26.
The dollar weakened after the Labor Department reported that annual inflation rose 2.5% in April, in line with forecasts, but monthly inflation rose by a smaller-than-forecast 0.2%.
Core, or underlying inflation rose 2.1% year-on-year last month and was up 0.1% from a month earlier.
The data indicated that the Fed would stick to plans for two additional rate hikes this year, but tempered expectations for a more aggressive pace of monetary tightening.
At the same time, another report showed that U.S. weekly jobless claims held at 211,000 last week, close to an almost 48 year low, pointing to continued strength in the labor market.
The dollar has been boosted in recent sessions by rising U.S. yields and the prospect of a faster pace of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve this year.
Expectations of higher interest rates make the dollar more attractive to investors seeking yield.

The officials will discuss exchange and interest rates, to be followed by a cost analysis of the government’s pre-election stimulus and incentive packages, according to a senior government official, who asked not to be named because the meeting hasn’t been announced. The lira extended gains on the news, rising 1.1 percent to 4.2401 per dollar as of 2:45 p.m. in Ankara.
In attendance will be Cetinkaya, Capital Markets Board chief Ali Fuat Taskesenlioglu, the banking regulator chief Mehmet Ali Akben, and Treasury Undersecretary Osman Celik, the person said. News of the previous day’s meeting sparked a rally of as much as 1.8 percent in the lira, after it had earlier tumbled to new record lows against the dollar and euro.
The officials will discuss routine technical issues and exchange ideas, and the meeting shouldn’t be expected to yield any policy announcements, according to another government official, who also asked not to be named.
In a statement following Wednesday’s gathering at the presidential palace, Erdogan’s office said that measures would be taken to tackle inflation and address pressure on the lira, without providing specifics. It ruled out any actions that would be inconsistent with open-market principles or the floating exchange-rate regime.
The statement also said Turkey would remain committed to a “growth-oriented"" economic policy."

GBP/USD was down 0.26% to 1.3510 by 07:21 ET (11:21 AM GMT), down from around 1.3605 earlier.
The BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee voted to leave UK interest rates on hold at 0.5% and also left its asset-purchase scheme unchanged.
The vote wasn’t unanimous, with Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders voting in favor of a rate hike.
The decision came after Britain's economy slowed to near stagnation in the first three months of 2018, with gross domestic product rising by just 0.1%.
Officials wanted to keep rates on hold until it becomes clear whether weak first quarter growth was just temporary or if it could persist.
“The recent weakness in data for the first quarter had been consistent with a temporary soft patch, with few implications for ... the outlook for the UK economy,” the meeting minutes said.
“There was value in seeing how the data unfolded over the coming months, to discern whether the softness in Q1 might persist.”
The bank cut growth forecasts, saying it now expects the UK economy to expand just 1.4% this year, down from 1.8% expected three months ago. The growth outlook for 2019 and 2020 was also downgraded, from 1.8% to 1.7%.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held firm on Thursday after the 10-year U.S. bond yield popped above the psychologically important 3 percent mark and investors looked to U.S. consumer price data later in the day that could show an acceleration in inflation.
The dollar index stood little changed against a basket of six major currencies (DXY) (=USD) at 93.02 after hitting a 4-1/2-month high of 93.42, extending its gains from its April low to 4.7 percent.
""Rises in U.S. interest rates are pushing the dollar higher,"" said Ayako Sera, market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, noting that investor sentiment is stronger now than in February when worries about higher rates hit stock prices.
""At the moment, inflation is higher and there's no major risk-off factors, with even the U.S. exit from the Iran nuclear deal having a minor impact. In that kind of environment, interest rate differentials will end up being the main driver for the dollar,"" she said.
U.S. consumer price data due at 1230 GMT is expected to show that annual core CPI inflation [USCPFY=ECI] rose to 2.2 percent in April, which would be the highest in more than a year, from 2.1 percent in March.
U.S. producer price inflation on Wednesday was slightly weaker than expected, however, this had little impact on market sentiment.
The 10-year U.S. bond yield rose above 3 percent (US10YT=RR) on Wednesday, edging near its 2014 peak of 3.041 percent. It last stood at 2.988 percent.

The British pound hovered above Monday's four-month low as traders expect the Bank of England to keep rates on hold at its meeting later in the day.
A recent run of weak UK economic data and renewed worries about Brexit have led markets to price out the possibility of a rate hike this month.
The pound last stood flat at $1.3561 , not far from $1.3485 touched on Monday.

1126,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2018 08:30PM ET</span>",China's yuan to cling to range despite trade spat with U.S.: poll,"By Vivek Mishra
BENGALURU (Reuters) - China's yuan is forecast to move only a little in the coming months as authorities keep a tight leash on the currency until it becomes clear whether the trade spat with the United States will worsen, a Reuters poll showed.
Despite the severity of the dispute and the potential to disrupt trade flows elsewhere, the range of yuan forecasts is even tighter than it was in polls taken in April and at the start of the year, reflecting that caution.
The move in the extremes of the range also suggests a gradual appreciation in the yuan. In the meantime, the resurgent U.S. dollar is at its strongest in over three months, but is still down more than 2 percent so far in 2018 against the yuan. 
The yuan  is forecast to trade steady at 6.37 per dollar in three months, according to a Reuters survey of over 60 foreign exchange analysts taken May 3-9. The currency is predicted to trade at 6.36 in a year. 
""As the U.S. dollar heads higher, it is unlikely that the Chinese yuan will be immune to this move. But, we expect USD/CNY to continue to range trade in the near term amid U.S.-China trade tensions,"" said Irene Cheung, senior strategist for Asia at ANZ.
Chinese officials are expected to meet their U.S. counterparts in Washington for a second round of negotiations next week, after talks last week in Beijing highlighted by a list of aggressive U.S. demands.
""A slight but persistent upward bias in the USD/CNY fixing and a cut in the Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR) suggest that China is being cautious until the trade tensions are resolved,"" Cheung added. 
The People's Bank of China (PBoC) lowered its daily currency reference rate  to its weakest since January on Wednesday. That move suggests policymakers might be working to limit gains in the yuan.
""It is unlikely that China and the U.S. will reach a grand deal very soon, given the large gap between the list of demands and offers,"" said Haibin Zhu, chief China economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in a note to clients.
""The biggest risk at this stage is that both sides have the wrong perception of the counterpart's bottom line, and both sides seem to have under-estimated the losses if a trade war eventually occurs.""
The risk of a trade war between the United States and China threatens to curb the economic momentum created by years of policy stimulus, a Reuters polls of over 500 economists worldwide found. [ECILT/WRAP]
According to a separate Reuters poll on currency positioning taken last week, bullish bets on the Chinese yuan fell to the lowest since October in the previous two weeks. But the survey did not point to any sharp depreciation in the yuan. [ASIA/FXP] 
A majority of strategists forecast the yuan to rise. That includes two respondents predicting it to strengthen sharply to 6.0 per dollar or lower, a rate not seen since China unified its dual exchange rates, officially devaluing the yuan overnight by 33 percent in January 1994.
""Recent trade-related anxieties could support the greenback and restrain the yuan for now,"" said Erik Nelson, currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).
""But confidence surveys point to steady and orderly growth, inflation has ticked higher, and China is gradually nudging interest rates up – factors that should eventually see a stronger Chinese yuan versus a soft U.S. dollar.""
To counter capital outflows following an interest rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve on March 21 the Chinese central bank raised its seven-day rate the day after and its 14-day rate in April.
That is a clear signal Beijing is watching policy moves across the globe and is ready to contain capital outflow risks.
REBOUNDING RUPEE
The Indian rupee , which has lost nearly 6 percent this year, hit its lowest level since February 2017 on Wednesday. But the currency is predicted to recoup some of those losses against the dollar over the coming year, largely supported by expectations for strong economic growth. [ECILT/IN]
The latest consensus is for the rupee to trade at 66.29 per dollar by end-July and at 65.83 in a year. It was trading around 67.42 on Wednesday.
""We see a firmer rupee over time. Overall economic growth continues to recover, while inflation softened. India's central bank remains neutral for now, while the committee's composition of votes remains slightly hawkish,"" added Wells Fargo's Nelson.
""India's relatively high interest rates and the recent announcement to increase debt quotas for foreign investors should support the rupee via capital inflows.""

1127,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2018 08:20PM ET</span>","Dollar resurgence to be short-lived, euro still favored: poll","By Shrutee Sarkar and Rahul Karunakar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The dollar's newfound shine will fade as the U.S. economy's strength and higher interest rates won't support the currency's resurgence for longer than another three months at most, a Reuters poll found.
After falling over 2 percent in the first quarter, in April the dollar made its biggest monthly gain since November 2016 by recouping those losses and is now up close to one percent for the year against a basket of currencies. (For a graphic on world FX rates in 2018 - http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh)
But medians in the latest poll of over 60 foreign exchange strategists taken May 3-9 forecast the greenback to be weaker in a year, leaving the euro (EUR=) up about 7 percent from where it is now.
""Analyzing the three key drivers of this dollar move – and their temporary nature – means we do not see much further scope for dollar upside,"" noted Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING.
""We modestly raise our USD forecasts for the summer, but remain convinced that by the end of the year – and into 2019 – structural forces will drive the dollar to levels weaker than where it currently trades today.""
Over two-thirds of the 66 respondents who answered a separate question said the recent dollar resurgence wouldn't last longer than three months, including 20 percent who expected it to end within a month.
Responses to another question showed over 60 percent of 55 strategists saying risks to their dollar forecasts were skewed more to the upside over the next three months.
However, in line with a weaker dollar view held in Reuters polls since almost the beginning of last year, strategists again forecast the greenback to fall over the coming year against most major currencies.
That suggests the latest dollar rally is partially driven by currency speculators unwinding bets against the greenback to the lowest in seven weeks, down sharply from a 6-1/2-year high net short position held last month.
""When dissecting the anatomy of this USD correction, we feel it exhibits all the hallmarks of a short squeeze. Positioning had clearly been stretched,"" Patel added.
Economic data out of the U.S. have largely been positive and reinforced the view for further rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, which is expected to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points in June and repeat that move twice more in 2018. [ECILT/US]
At the same time, there are clear signs the euro zone and British economies are cooling.
The Bank of England will wait until August before raising interest rates, according to another Reuters poll in which nearly all economists pushed back previous expectations of a hike on Thursday. [BOE/INT]
Britain's pound  fell to a fresh four-month low on Tuesday as the dollar extended its rally.
Still, sterling's recent slide was expected to be short-lived, with the currency forecast to bounce back over the coming year. [GBP/POLL]
The euro zone's economic growth momentum, already moderating partly from a stronger currency, slowed in the first quarter and inflation unexpectedly took a hit in April, possibly making it more difficult for the European Central Bank to end its over 2.5 trillion euro bond buying scheme later this year.
While the dollar did strengthen last month and may continue to in the near-term, the euro and other major currencies are expected to reverse losses and be up in a year.
The euro (EUR=) is forecast to trade higher at $1.27 in a year's time, up nearly 7 percent from around $1.19 on Wednesday.

""Long-term risks remain tilted to the downside for the greenback. The maturing U.S. cycle, the fiscal imbalances, the political context...in conjunction with the U.S. external policies risk triggering additional USD weakness in the long run,"" wrote Roberto Cobo Garcia, currency strategist at BBVA (MC:BBVA).

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.02% to 92.92. The greenback fell from an intraday high of 93.26.
The Labor Department said on Wednesday its producer price index for final demand fell by 0.1% last month after, confounding expectations for a 0.2% rise. In the 12 months through August, the PPI rose 2.6% after rising 3% in March.
The downbeat economic report led some analysts to suggest that wholesale inflation was unwinding as the recent string of upbeat PPI reports were mostly driven by a recovery from hurricanes seen in the United States last year.
""We've seen big PPI gains in six of the last nine months that were at least initially lifted by hurricane disruptions,"" Action Economics said in a note to clients. ""Firmness past the disruption period is slowly unwinding now.""

1129,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2018 10:23AM ET</span>",Is the dollar rally going further? Chartists think so,"By Saikat Chatterjee and Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar's near-5 percent rally against a basket of currencies in the space of just three weeks has brought it up against some critical technical levels, which could give fresh legs to the greenback if successfully broken.
The initial catalyst was the realization that some of the world's biggest central banks, notably the European Central Bank, would not in the near-term follow the example of the U.S. Federal Reserve in raising interest rates from crisis-era lows.
But there are other factors too. From the widening interest rate differential in favor of the United States to investors' need to unwind some of the short dollar positions they had built up over the past year and low market volatility, all these are conspiring to make the dollar more attractive.
""It is certainly shaping up to be another incredibly bullish trading week for the greenback, which has punched above 93.35, its highest level this year,"" said Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst at FXTM, a currency broker.
""The dollar index remains heavily bullish on the daily charts as there have been consistently higher highs and higher lows."" 
Graphic: Dollar index breaks above 200-DMA for first time in a year - https://reut.rs/2In9e7R
On three major market metrics -- valuations, positioning and technical indicators -- the dollar looks set for more gains, market players reckon. 
TECHNICAL 
Against some of its major rivals, the dollar is perched at some key technical levels. 
David Madden, markets analyst at CMC Markets reckons the dollar has recently completed what is known as a ""double-bottom"" reversal. 
Graphic: Dollar marks double-bottom reversal - https://reut.rs/2IoqMQP
According to technical analysis website, StockCharts.com, this is a bullish reversal pattern, made up of two consecutive troughs that are roughly equal, with a moderate peak-in between.
""There's a good argument to be made that the downward trend that was in for a while, has been negated because the lows we saw in January and February were multi-year lows,"" Madden said. 
""So we could push on higher from here.""
For instance, the dollar broke through a 200-day moving average against the British pound last week for the first time in a year. A rise to around $1.3257 would mark the 50 percent range of the pre-Brexit referendum high of $1.5022 and an October 2016 low of $1.1491.
The euro has also lost momentum after scaling a 3-1/2 year high of $1.2556 in mid-February and is now down more than 1 percent on the year, a remarkable turnaround fom last year when it gained more than 10 percent against the dollar.
Market analysts now expect the euro to weaken to as much as $1.1747. 
POSITIONING
On a positioning basis too, the stars appear aligned for further dollar gains, given the overhang of record short bets against the greenback. 
Graphic: Bear hug - https://reut.rs/2IpraPb
While short-dollar bets have seen a sizeable drop in the last two weeks, according to speculative positioning data from Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a sizeable $18 billion in positions still remain, far more than recent averages.
Banks' survey data also indicate the same. Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) monthly survey of funds showed in April that short dollar bets remained well above historical averages, indicating the dollar has more room to strengthen as these bets are unwound.
VALUATIONS
Finally, despite the dollar's recent surge, it still stands below its median value on a 20-year horizon, according to a JP Morgan trade-weighted dollar index. 
Graphic: Fairly valued on a historical basis - https://reut.rs/2ItjqvA
The dollar also offers some of the highest returns thanks to rising yields on the short end of the interest rate curve.
Two-year U.S. Treasury yields are above 2.5 percent, its highest in nearly a decade. So investing in dollars by borrowing in euros offers a chunky yield of 3 percent over a one-year horizon. 
That yield has become more attractive as currency market volatility has plumbed to new lows. Three-month implied volatility on the euro-dollar  is now at its lowest levels in four years.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategists say the ""carry-to-vol ratios"" or returns adjusted for expected market swings for most currencies are at or close to multi-decade highs, indicating more upside for the dollar in the short term.

1130,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 09, 2018 08:31AM ET</span>",Emerging-Market Currencies Say Adios to 2018 Gain Amid Iran Risk,"(Bloomberg) -- On the day that a key gauge of currencies in developing economies erased its gains for the year, the voices saying it may be the start of a deeper selloff are growing louder.
“Risk factors such as the Iran deal have emerged on top of an already weak environment for emerging markets because of the rising dollar and U.S. yields,” said Motoko Miyano, deputy general manager of the treasury in Bangkok at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. “Foreign investors have been selling emerging markets, and that’s starting to deepen the selloff in emerging-market currencies.”
After clocking up the best start to any year since 2012, the MSCI Emerging-Market Currency dropped on Wednesday by 0.3 percent, wiping out its entire year-to-date advance, repeating a feat accomplished by an index of stocks last week. And if the options market is anything to go by, the weakening trend has further to go. Bears outnumber bulls in every emerging-market currency, according to three- and six-month risk reversals.
While there have been plenty of catalysts to the retreat -- from concerns over a global trade war to evidence of faster U.S. inflation -- currencies extended their declines Wednesday after President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the 2015 accord to curb Iran’s nuclear program, sending Treasury yields back to 3 percent-level, the dollar to a four-month high and U.S. crude through $70 a barrel.
The selloff is a shift for developing-nation assets, which enjoyed a two-year rally that drove stocks and a gauge of currencies to the highest level since at least 2007. Global investors dumped emerging-market bonds for a second straight week in the period ended May 2, the first time that’s happened since November 2016, according to EPFR data compiled by Jefferies Hong Kong.
Unquestionably, emerging markets still have their champions. Even Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday the developing economies are well-placed to navigate a period of rising U.S. interest rates.
And idiosyncratic issues in Turkey and Argentina have a lot to do with the current nervousness. The Argentine peso has lost 17 percent this year and the Turkish lira 11 percent as the two countries have grappled with accelerating inflation and investor skepticism about central bank policy. The lira on Wednesday reversed its losses after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was said to summon economy officials to discuss the slide the currency.
Yet they’re only two of five currencies that have weakened more than 5 percent this year, and the Colombian peso, Malaysian ringgit, Chinese yuan and Thai baht are still showing gains, evidence that Asia is a relative haven amid the turmoil.

The Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) index of local-currency government bonds slipped 0.3 percent on Tuesday, trimming its 2018 gain to 0.3 percent.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, climbed 0.31% to 92.89 by 05:02 AM ET (09:02 AM GMT), the highest level since late December.
Rising U.S. Treasury yields and broadly solid economic data have boosted the dollar in recent weeks, underlining expectations for a steady pace of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve this year.
The central bank has projected two more increases for the year, but some investors expect three more.

The euro failed to find much support after data showing that German industrial output rose more than expected in March. The report helped ease concerns that the euro area’s largest economy is facing headwinds from rising protectionism.
Data on Monday had shown that German industrial orders dropped for a third month running in March.
A recent soft patch of economic data has given rise to speculation that the European Central Bank may not be able to end its asset purchasing stimulus program in September, as some investors had expected.
Sterling was also weaker, with GBP/USD sliding 0.34% to 1.3511, closing in on last Friday’s four month lows of 1.3485.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was almost unchanged at 92.63 by 03:19 AM ET (07:19 AM GMT), within close reach of Monday’s highs of 92.82, the most since December 26.
Demand for the dollar continued to be underpinned as rising U.S. Treasury yields and broadly solid economic data has underlined expectations for a steady pace of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve this year.

The Aussie was sent lower by the worse-than-expected retail sales data, and it reacted little to China trade data that came in broadly positive.
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies rose 0.05% to 92.66 at 11:55PM ET (03:55 GMT). The greenback climbed to its highest level this year at 92.82 overnight.
Events to look out this week for the greenback’s movement include U.S. President Trump’s decision on whether to withdraw from the Iran deal later in the day. U.S. withdrawal would mean unclear geopolitical developments in the Middle East that can weigh down the dollar. The U.S. is also due to release its PPI and CPI data on Wednesday and Thursday respectively.

China’s April exports denominated in yuan rose 3.7% from a year earlier, compared with a decline of 9.8% in March.
Yuan-denominated imports rose 11.6% last month, compared to a 5.9% gain in March, resulting in a trade surplus of $28.72 billion for the period.
The AUD/USD pair lost 0.29% at 0.7493. Australian Retail Sales numbers missed expectations, showing 0.0% growth on the year-on-year period for March, missing the 0.3% expected contraction and a complete collapse from the previous reading of 0.6%. As Australia’s largest trading partner, China’s trade data could be a directional driver for the Aussie. Though China trade data came in broadly positive on Tuesday, the Aussie extended its losses.

Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon.
“Eventually, it will be comparable -- eventually is 20 or 30 years,” Dimon said when asked in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Stephen Engle whether China’s yuan would rise to have a role akin to the dollar in the global financial system. “It’s not comparable if it’s not convertible.”
China’s moves up to now, such as winning official reserve-currency status for the yuan at the International Monetary Fund, amount to “small” changes, according to Dimon. He regarded this year’s inclusion of some domestic Chinese equities into MSCI Inc. international stock indexes as a “nice thing -- it gets the world more educated about China -- but in terms of actual dollar amount” of inflows it’s “not going to be Earth-shattering to China or to anybody else.”
“They’re going to have to have a convertible currency” for overseas investors to participate fully in China’s domestic stock market, Dimon said. “That’s quite a ways away.”
When it comes to China’s bond market, now about $10 trillion, Dimon listed a number of needed reforms, especially for corporate securities:
“They’re on the way but they still have quite a way to go” to create a “really healthy bond market,” he said. “Until you can buy and sell securities freely -- if you have the U.S. dollar you can buy and sell securities freely -- then that’s a big thing.”

1143,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2018 08:40PM ET</span>","Dollar hovers near 4-month high, euro hit by weak data","By Shinichi Saoshiro
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar hovered near a four-month high on Tuesday, backed by rising Treasury yields and broadly strong U.S. economic data, leaving its major rivals such as the euro struggling and others including the Argentine peso down sharply.
The dollar index against basket of six major currencies was steady at 92.766 (DXY) after reaching 92.974 overnight, its highest since Dec. 28.
The greenback received its latest boost as the euro sank below $1.19 for the first time this year the previous day in the wake of weaker-than-forecast data on German industrial orders and euro zone investor sentiment.
The euro was up 0.05 percent at $1.1929 (EUR=) after plumbing $1.1897 the previous day, its lowest in more than four months.
The soft economic indicators added to already shrinking expectations of the European Central Bank raising interest rates any time soon, which has been a major drag on the common currency.
""There is some focus on the Iran nuclear situation but the market has priced in much of it before hand, said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
U.S. President Donald Trump said he would announce a decision on Tuesday about the future of an international nuclear agreement with Iran, which he has repeatedly threatened to withdraw from.
""While a U.S. withdrawal from the deal may be a dollar-negative theme, but at least for the short term it is hard to ignore the dollar's broad strength, particularly against emerging market currencies like the Argentine peso,"" Ishizuki added.
Rising U.S. Treasury yields and solid economic data have bolstered the dollar in recent weeks. While Friday's U.S. payrolls data came in mixed, underlying strength in the labor market backed expectations of steady rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
Indeed, monetary policy normalisation in the United States, which has move significantly ahead of other countries, has also been a major dollar-supportive factor.
And persistent concerns over rising U.S. interest rates kept up the relentless sell-off in Latin American currencies overnight, with the Mexican, Chilean and Argentine pesos all falling more than 1 percent, while the Brazilian real lost0.84 percent.
The Argentine peso's slide stood out in particular as the country's central bank had just raised rates on Friday.
Emerging market currencies have taken a hit in recent weeks as investors have shed high-yielding assets on expectations that accelerating U.S. inflation and a widening fiscal deficit could force the Fed to tighten policy at a quicker pace.
Elsewhere, the dollar was down 0.1 percent at 108.990 yen  after going as high as 109.400 overnight.

The Australian dollar was flat at $0.7518  after losing 0.3 percent the previous day against a broadly stronger dollar.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.16% to 92.57. The greenback
The dollar remained supported despite retreating from a 2018 high of 92.82, as investors continued to bet on further Federal Reserve rate hikes despite a weaker-than-expected jobs report on Friday.
The U.S. economy created 164,000 in April, missing economists’ forecast for 189,000 new jobs. The jobless rate fell to 3.9%, while average hourly earnings grew 0.1%.
Tighter labor markets, however, are expected to eventually lead to sustained wage growth, pushing inflation above the Fed’s 2% target.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said on Monday he is comfortable with “some overshoot” of inflation and reiterated his view for two further rate hikes this year.
The dollar has gained more than 4% so far this year but has limited room for further upsides, analysts at ING warned, citing “structural forces.”
ING said it remained convinced that by the end of the year - and into 2019 – “structural forces” will drive the dollar to levels weaker than where it currently trades.
This comes as the bank highlighted the divergence between US growth and interest rates compared to the rest of the world as one of the factors for the dollar rally. This economic divergence, however, is nearing its peak, the bank said, limiting the potential upside in the dollar.
Weakness in EUR/USD limited downside momentum in the greenback as the currency pair fell 0.29% to $1.1926, after German factory orders fell short of economists’ forecasts.
The softer German factory orders added to the recent raft of weaker Eurozone economic data, forcing traders to trim their bets on the European Central Bank unwinding monetary policy stimulus sooner rather than later.
GBP/USD rose 0.22% to $1.3561 on lighter volumes amid a bank holiday in the UK.
USD/JPY fell 0.03% to 109.09, while USD/CAD rose 0.03% to C$1.2849. The latter pair was limited by an ongoing rally in oil prices – supporting the Canadian dollar – amid growing expectations that US President Trump will decide on May 12 to withdraw the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal."

In a session with no major economic reports, investors will watch appearances from members of the Federal Reserve to gauge the future path of monetary policy.
Fed officials Raphael Bostic, Tom Barkin, Charles Evans and Robert Kaplan will all deliver speeches throughout the day on Monday.
The most recent jobs report released last Friday showed fewer jobs were created in April than expected, but the unemployment rate fell to 3.9%, its lowest level since December 2000.
Wage inflation remained subdued with a 2.6% rise year-on-year, missing expectations for a gain of 2.7%.
The increase in wages is being closely monitored by the Federal Reserve for evidence of diminishing slack in the labor market and upward pressure on inflation. Economists generally consider an increase of 3.0% or more to be consistent with rising inflation.
The data did little to alter market expectations for the Fed’s monetary policy path with the next hike still priced for June, with a follow-up in September. Odds for a fourth increase in 2018 at the end of the year remained at around 42% at the time of writing.
In currency pairs, GBP/USD inched up 0.05% to 1.3538 with UK traders celebrating a holiday on Monday.
Meanwhile, the euro continued to be under pressure, as investors continued to weigh signs that the euro zone economy was losing momentum. Among reports released on Monday, German factory orders registered a surprise decline of 0.9%.
The euro zone purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for the retail sector slipped into contraction, with the sharpest decline in annual sales in the last 13 months.
The Sentix investor confidence for the euro area also unexpectedly dropped to 19.2 in May, missing expectations for an advance to 21.2.
EUR/USD was last down 0.23% at 1.1933.
The dollar also traded 0.32% higher against the Swiss franc as Switzerland saw inflation data ease in April.
Over in Asia, the USD/JPY pair gained 0.14% to 109.26, following Japan’s Golden Week holiday period. The Bank of Japan’s monetary policy meeting minutes were released on Monday morning.

The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies last stood at 92.30, down 0.13% at 11:22PM ET (03:22 GMT). The greenback reached this year’s new high at 92.70 last Friday, then dropped to the 92.30 level on Monday morning. Despite the recent momentum, the dollar has lost 6.3% in a year.
The trade talks between the U.S. and China continued, with a long list of demands in a statement titled “Balancing the Trade Relationship” issued by the two countries in an attempt to resolve the disputes. China requested the 25% extra tariffs lifted, while the U.S. expressed concerns over intellectual properties.

1147,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2018 12:30AM ET</span>",Dollar index at near four-month high after U.S. jobs data,"By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar stayed near its 2018 peak on Monday after U.S. jobs and wages data did little to temper perceptions of strength in the U.S. economy, though renewed concerns about trade frictions could cloud its outlook.
The dollar index (DXY) (=USD) stood at 92.461, down 0.1 percent but still near Friday's high of 92.908, which was its firmest level since late December.
The dollar index has risen for three straight weeks, maintaining its strength after Friday's mixed U.S. data.
The U.S. economy added fewer jobs than expected and the average hourly earnings, closely watched for signs of inflationary pressures, rose a less-than-expected 0.1 percent in April, leaving the annual increase at 2.6 percent.
The unemployment rate dropped to near a 17-1/2-year low of 3.9 percent, although this was driven in part by Americans leaving the labor force.
None of this changed the perception that the Federal Reserve will likely hike interest rates at least twice, and possibly three times, by year-end.
In contrast, recent data suggested Europe's stellar growth last year is losing momentum, leading speculators to trim bets on the single currency on expectations the European Central Bank will wind down its stimulus.
The euro changed hands at $1.1962 (EUR=), not far from Friday's four-month low of $1.1910.
Data from U.S. financial watchdog published late on Friday showed speculators' net long position in the euro in Chicago's futures exchange declined only slightly in the latest week.
They held 120,568 contracts of net short positions <1099741NNET>, down from a record 151,476 set last month but still at a high level.
A wider measure of dollar positioning  that includes contracts on some emerging market currencies showed net dollar shorts shrank to $18.32 billion, from a seven-year high of $28.18 billion two weeks earlier.
""Speculators' positioning has gone to extreme levels as they had been selling the dollar continuously,"" Yukio Ishizuki, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.
Concerns about U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionism was one big reason many investors had shied away from the dollar earlier.
Some market participants expect worries over a trade war could return after talks between the United States and China produced little apparent progress.
In a sign that the trade tension is spilling over to other issues, Beijing and Washington came to loggerheads over how to refer to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.
""Trade issues are likely to persist towards the U.S. mid-term elections. So in the long run, the dollar is likely to decline,"" said a currency trader at a Japanese bank.
Traders also kept an eye on the fate of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal, from which Trump has threatened to pull out.
An escalating diplomatic standoff could have innumerable repercussions, including a further rise in oil prices and damage to investors' risk appetite.
Trump has said that unless European allies rectify ""flaws"" in Tehran's deal with world powers by May 12 he will refuse to extend U.S. sanctions relief for Iran.
Elsewhere, the British pound  traded at $1.3538, near its four-month low of $1.3487 touched on Tuesday.
The dollar stood little changed at 109.10 yen , off its three-month high of 110.05 yen.
The yen's rebound was in part driven by short-covering by Japanese margin traders, especially against the Turkish lira , which fell to record lows during Japan's Golden Week holidays.

The lira fell more than 4 percent last week versus the dollar.

1148,By Investing.com,"<span>May 06, 2018 06:01AM ET</span>",Forex - Weekly Outlook: May 7 - 11,"Investing.com - Investors will be awaiting updates on U.S. producer price and consumer price inflation on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, hoping for fresh insight on how how quickly interest rates may rise this year.
In a light week on the economic calendar, trade talks will remain in the spotlight with officials from the U.S., Canada and Mexico set to resume talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement in Washington on Monday.
Thursday’s Bank of England meeting will also be in focus, with investors overwhelmingly expecting rates to remain on hold after a recent spate of weak economic data.
The dollar hit the highest levels of the year on Friday buoyed up by expectations for further interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve this year before trimming back gains slightly after disappointing U.S. employment data for April.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, rose to 92.75, the most since December 27 before pulling back to 92.42 late Friday. The index posted a weekly gain of 1.17%.
The dollar has risen as investors bet that the Fed will continue raising rates while other central banks, including the European Central Bank and the BoE will act more slowly.
Data on Friday showing that the U.S. economy added fewer than expected jobs in April while wages barely rose did little to alter the view that rates will continue to rise this year.
In its rate statement last Wednesday the Fed acknowledged that inflation had moved closer to its 2% target. Fed officials are projecting two more rate hikes they year, although an increasing number of investors now see three hikes as possible.
The euro fell to four month lows on Friday, with EUR/USD touching 1.1911 before pulling back to 1.1961 in late trade, for a weekly loss of 1.4%.
Sentiment on the single currency was hit by data earlier in the week showing that growth in the euro zone slowed in the first three months of this year, underlining the case for the ECB’s caution in removing stimulus measures.
The pound also hit four month lows, with GBP/USD ending at 1.3531, down 1.79% for the week.
The dollar rose above parity with the Swiss franc on Friday, with USD/CHF rising as high as 1.0023.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.12% to 92.39. The greenback rose to its highest level in 2018 after hitting an intraday of 92.75.
The U.S. economy created 164,000 in April, above the 135,000 jobs created in March, according to a report released Friday by the U.S. Department of Labor. But that missed economists’ forecast for 189,000.
The jobless rate fell to 3.9%, beating economists’ forecasts for a 0.1% decline to 4%. Average hourly earnings grew 0.1% for April, below expectations for a 0.2% increase.
BNP Paribas said the softer nonfarm payrolls print would not have a “substantial” impact on the Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions as employment gains remained above its estimated breakeven.
The bank also said it expected wage growth would persist despite uncertainty as to why tightness in the labor market was not translating into wage growth.
“Deceleration in wage growth was surprising given such signs of labor market tightness. Why this tightness is not feeding into greater average hourly earnings growth remains a bit of a puzzle,” BNP Paribas .
Dollar strength was also underpinned by ongoing weakness in the both the pound and the euro as both pairs were set to post a third-straight weekly loss.

1150,By Investing.com,"<span>May 04, 2018 11:18AM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar Hits Fresh 4-Month High After Mixed Jobs Report,"Investing.com - The dollar marked a fresh four-month high against major rivals on Friday after the release of the monthly nonfarm payrolls.
At 11:17AM ET (15:17GMT), the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.34% to 92.59. The intraday high of 92.75 was the strongest level since December 27.
The move higher came after a mixed jobs report that showed fewer jobs were created in April than expected, but the unemployment rate fell to 3.9%, its lowest level since December 2000.
Wage inflation remained subdued with a 2.6% rise year-on-year, missing expectations for a gain of 2.7%.

However, most experts believe that it is only a matter of time before the tightening labor market begins to push wages higher. The last time the jobless rate was at the current 17-year low annual wage inflation was climbing 4.3%.
“We still believe that the wage story will turn higher and be the catalyst for the Fed to take a more aggressive stance on the inflation threat,” ING economists remarked after the release.
“We continue to look for 3 further interest rates rises this year, starting with June 13,” they concluded.
Dollar strength was widespread after the report although most major rivals were pulling back from respective lows against the greenback.
GBP/USD was last down 0.43% to 1.3517, off an intraday low of 1.3487, its lowest since January 10. The move comes ahead of the Bank of England’s policy meeting next week. A string of weak data and comments from policymakers have dampened expectations that the central bank will move on interest rates.
Similarly, EUR/USD was last at 1.1929 after falling as far as 1.1911 earlier, its lowest level since December 28. Data released Friday in the euro zone showed weaker than expected retail sales and business activity, underlining the case for the European Central Bank’s caution in removing stimulus measures.

More than two years into his efforts to revive South America’s second-largest economy, his government is suddenly being tested by an abrupt decline in the nation’s currency, the peso.
Behind the weakness is growing concern that the center-right leader has dragged his feet on some painful, deeper reforms -- and that both inflation and government spending are spiraling dangerously high.
For the third time in less than a week, the central bank on Friday moved to shore up the peso after its two previous attempts had little effect. The currency had its worst decline since December 2015 on Thursday to reach a new low. It rebounded on Friday after the bank announced an additional 675 basis point-increase on its key interest rate to 40 percent, the highest among major economies. The peso jumped 4 percent to trade at 21.48 per dollar in morning trading in New York.
Still, the magnitude of the central bank moves underscores the challenges facing Macri as he attempts to improve the economy and roll back protectionist measures put in place by his predecessor, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.
“Investors gave Macri about a year and a half of a grace period to put the house in order. After that they started to worry,” said Claudio Loser, founding member and director of Centennial Group Latin America and a former head of the International Monetary Fund’s operations in the Western Hemisphere. “Now that the fiscal adjustment remains weak, inflation unwavering, and U.S. bonds more attractive, investors are evidently losing their patience.”
What the first two rate hikes failed to fully convey is a sense that government officials -- not only at the central bank, but also at the treasury and finance ministries and the presidency -- will be acting in a coordinated manner to tackle inflation and shore up finances, according to strategists, economists and traders.
It’s a disappointment to many investors who saw Macri’s election in 2015 and his promises to bring predictability and lure foreign capital as a turning point. For years, Argentina had suffered from state interference in the economy and lawsuits with disgruntled creditors that locked it out of international capital markets.
“External conditions will not accommodate the government’s strategy of gradually removing the country from its medicine -- it’s time to rip the Band-Aid off,” said Sean Newman, a money manager who helps oversee $3.8 billion in assets at Invesco Advisers. “The pace at which the fiscal deficit is closed needs to be accelerated.”
On Friday, Treasury Minister Nicolas Dujovne announced Argentina will reduce spending on infrastructure by 30 billion pesos ($1.4 billion) this year and will find savings of about $3.2 billion. The government will target a primary fiscal deficit of 2.7 percent of GDP, lower than the previous target of 3.2 percent, Dujovne told journalists in Buenos Aires.
Alberto Ramos, the head of Latin America research at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., said monetary policy needs to be accompanied by strong signals officials will shore up the budget.
It couldn’t come soon enough for currency traders, who have made the peso the worst performer in emerging markets this year as it sank 19 percent. The country’s overseas bonds -- including a 100-year note it sold last year -- are also among the world’s worst performers, and Telecom Argentina and Petroquimica Comodoro Rivadavia SA have had to postpone debt sales amid the carnage.
The central bank said in a statement the rate hikes were aimed at reducing volatility from external factors and making sure inflation heads toward the 15 percent target. The presidency said Thursday that it backs the central bank in its fight against inflation and reaffirmed that the bank is independent and has all the tools necessary.
High Inflation
The selloff has its roots in an unconventional move in December. That’s when central bank President Federico Sturzenegger, after pumping up rates to the highest in the world in a bid to rein in price increases, loosened inflation targets after coming under pressure from the government. In January, the bank cut rates by 1.5 percentage points, even as annual inflation running at about 25 percent showed no signs of abating. It’s accelerated since then.
Macri has stuck with a plan of only gradually tackling the government budget deficit, something he predicted would be made easier by quicker economic growth. But with analysts expecting the combined current-account and budget balance to exceed 10 percent of gross domestic product this year, investors are growing skeptical of the strategy.
“We’re in the emergency room now and we need bold moves to anchor the system,” Ramos said. “The policy mistake was cutting rates when inflation expectations were deteriorating rapidly. They’re now doing the right thing in order to bring order to the foreign exchange rate market and to regain some of the lost credibility, but it’s going to be tough.”
New Strategy
Before the recent surprise interest-rate increases the central bank had been relying on selling dollars in the currency market to try to buoy the peso. This year, they’ve spent $6.9 billion on the efforts, or about 10 percent of the country’s international reserves.
On Wednesday night, policy makers seemed to be rethinking that strategy and planning to reduce the amount of dollars they sell, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. They say officials attribute peso’s decline mostly to external shocks.
And no doubt there have been global factors in the peso’s drop. Global pessimism toward riskier assets and renewed dollar strength have been factors. But also at play is an exodus of overseas investors from Argentina after a new income tax for foreigners took effect.
On the fiscal side, Macri is facing pressure from labor unions to boost salaries to keep up with inflation at the same he’s running into resistance against efforts to curtail energy subsidies and pass the higher costs on the consumers. Opposition lawmakers have put forward bills looking to partially roll back the price increases, a move that shook utility stocks. After talks with coalition members, Macri will allow consumers to pay increases in installments.
“If the government backslides on the fiscal area to ease people’s pain, the market will keep the pressure on,” said Greg Lesko, a money manager at Deltec Asset Management.

1152,By Investing.com,"<span>May 03, 2018 10:46PM ET</span>",Forex – Dollar Slides After 4-month High; Aussie Firmer On RBA’s Optimism,"Investing.com –  The dollar slipped against the other major Asian currencies on Friday morning after it jumped to this year’s high on Thursday. The Aussie was the best performer on Friday after the Reserve Bank of Australia struck a positive tone in its statement of monetary policy.
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies last stood at 92.21, down 0.08% at 10:30PM ET (02:30 GMT). The greenback reached this year’s new high on Thursday at 92.66, then slipped back to the 92.2 level on Friday.
The U.S. will release a slew of data later in the day, including nonfarm payrolls and the jobless rate that might give another push to the greenback. On a side note, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday.
The USD/JPY pair eased 0.19% to 108.98. Japan’s market remained closed for Greenery Day.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.25% at 0.7550. The RBA said in its statement that Australia's GDP growth is expected to hit 3.25% by December 2018, though the unemployment rate has missed the expected level and inflation is unlikely to reach its target until 2020, which means the interest rates will continue to stay at record lows of 1.5%.
“Overall, the Australian economy is progressing broadly on the track the Bank has been expecting for a while... If the economy continues to perform as expected, higher interest rates are likely to be appropriate at some time,” said the RBA.
The Aussie, however, got weighed down by China’s softer-than-expected Services PMI, which came in at 52.9. The reading came better than the previous reading of 52.3 but still missed the expected 53.9. China’s data could put pressure on the Aussie that shares heavy trade with China.
In China, the People's Bank of China set the set the reference rate for the yuan against the dollar, the mid-point from which the currency is allowed to trade, at 6.3521versus the previous day's 6.3732. The USD/CNY pair lost 0.15% to trade at 6.3429."
1153,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2018 04:09AM ET</span>",Dollar down from four-month highs ahead of U.S. jobs data,"By Masayuki Kitano
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar held steady against a basket of currencies on Friday, having retreated from four-month highs on profit-taking, with the focus on whether U.S. jobs data will provide the spark for another push higher.
The dollar has erased all its 2018 losses over the past few weeks on expectations the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates while other central banks, including the European Central Bank, take longer to reduce stimulus.
Additional dollar gains will likely depend on data showing a further improvement in growth and inflation, which could fan speculation that the U.S. central bank will raise interest rates this year three more times.
The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies held steady at 92.417 (DXY). That was down from a peak of 92.834 set on Wednesday, the greenback's strongest level since late December.
The dollar index has climbed more than 0.9 percent so far this week, putting it on track for a third straight weekly gain.
The Fed held interest rates steady on Wednesday and expressed confidence that a recent quickening in inflation to near the central bank's target would be sustained, leaving it on track to raise borrowing costs in June.
Some analysts interpreted the Fed's comments on inflation as a signal it may allow price growth beyond its target, a stance that would limit the need for it to embark on a more aggressive path of tightening.
Friday's employment report for April will be evaluated for further indications of the strength of the U.S. labor market and inflation pressures.
""Any slowdown in the pace of wage growth should re-energise dollar bears,"" Christopher Wong, senior FX strategist for Maybank in Singapore, said in a note.
Key support for the dollar index lies at its 200-day moving average, which is now near 92, Wong added. 
Non-farm payrolls probably increased by 192,000 jobs last month, according to a Reuters survey of economists. Payrolls rose by 103,000 positions in March, the smallest gain in six months, which economists dismissed as payback after unseasonably mild weather boosted hiring in February.
Average hourly earnings are expected to have risen 0.2 percent last month. That would leave the annual increase in average hourly earnings at 2.7 percent, steady from the pace recorded in March.
If the U.S. data points to solid wage growth, the dollar is likely to rise, especially against the euro, said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore.
""If...wages come out a little bit stronger than expected, I think the euro tests $1.19,"" Innes said.
The euro held steady at $1.1987 (EUR=), staying above a near four-month low of $1.1938 set on Wednesday.
The common currency had risen 0.3 percent on Thursday, shrugging off data showing an unexpected slowdown in euro zone inflation, as the dollar's recent rally paused.
The U.S. dollar eased 0.1 percent to 109.08 yen , down from a three-month high of 110.05 yen struck on Wednesday. 

The Australian dollar bounced modestly as speculators took profits on long U.S. dollar positions. The Aussie rose 0.2 percent to $0.7549 , pulling away from an 11-month low near $0.7472 set earlier in the week.

1155,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 08:42PM ET</span>","Venezuela says taking over Banesco for 90 days, arrests 11 top bank execs","By Corina Pons and Alexandra Ulmer
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela said on Thursday it would take over the country's leading private bank Banesco for 90 days and announced the arrest of 11 top executives for ""attacks"" against the country's rapidly depreciating bolivar currency.
The detentions come on the heels of last month's shock arrests of two Venezuelan executives working in the country for U.S. oil major  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX).
Oil-rich Venezuela is suffering hyperinflation and a steady collapse of the bolivar currency, which President Nicolas Maduro has attributed to an ""economic war,"" but critics blame on incompetence and failed socialist policies.
Maduro's foes say he is cracking down on the business sector to try to shore up support and halt price increases ahead of a controversial May 20 presidential election, which key opposition parties have boycotted as a sham.
Chief Prosecutor Tarek Saab announced the arrests in a televised press conference, but did not provide evidence of wrongdoing or take any questions. 
""We have determined the (executives') presumed responsibility for a series of irregularities, for aiding and concealing attacks against the Venezuelan currency with the aim of demolishing the Venezuelan currency,"" said Saab, a former ruling party governor. 
State television late on Thursday broadcast a statement announcing the temporary takeover of Banesco, which the government said was designed to ensure the bank continues operating. 
The government also said it would be appointing a board of directors led by the country's Vice Finance Minister Yomana Koteich. 
Banesco's President Juan Carlos Escotet, who lives in Spain, earlier blasted the arrests as ""disproportionate"" and said he was flying to Venezuela to try to free the 11 executives, who include Chief Executive Oscar Doval. 
""In the next few hours, I'm taking a plane for Venezuela. We're going to knock on every door so that this problem is cleared up and they are freed as they deserve to be,"" Escotet, who was born in Venezuela to Spanish parents and holds both nationalities, said in a video posted on Twitter.
Escotet has been a frequent target of criticism by ruling party heavyweight Diosdado Cabello, who recently announced that the government was buying Banesco. Escotet denied any sale.
Escotet temporarily excused himself from his role as chairman of Galicia-based bank ABANCA, the bank said in a statement to Spain's stock market regulator on Thursday.
'MORE CRISIS AND MISERY' 
Venezuela's opposition said the arrests were another sign of Maduro's turn to authoritarianism. 
""The irresponsible government ... continues to deny its responsibility in the destruction of our bolivar. Now they're attacking Banesco. (This) ... will only spawn more crisis and misery,"" tweeted opposition lawmaker Carlos Valero. 
Venezuela maintains exchange controls under which the government is meant to provide hard currency at a steadily weakening official rate , currently 69,000 bolivars per dollar.
But the dollar is fetching around 800,000 bolivars in unofficial trade, which government officials have for years harshly criticized but broadly tolerated. 

Hyperinflation has turned once-powerful banks into warehouses of unwanted and mostly useless cash worth a total of only $40 million, according to a recent Reuters analysis of regulatory data.

At 11:57AM ET (15:57GMT), the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.22% to 92.39, backing away from Wednesday’s highs of 92.66, which was the strongest level since December 28.
That was still off an intraday low of 92.20.
Earlier Thursday morning, weekly initial jobless claims rose less than feared, while continuing jobless claims, which measures the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, dropped to their lowest level since December 1973.
Factory orders also gave an upbeat outlook for the American economy as they rose 1.6% in March, beating the consensus forecast for a 1.3% rise. To the downside, service sector activity slowed more than expected in April, but still maintained its 99th consecutive month of expansion. 
In other pairs with the greenback, the pound traded lower following data showing that activity in the UK service sector picked up slightly last month, but remained subdued. The report added to a recent string of weak data and policymakers’ remarks that convinced investors that the Bank of England will leave interest rates unchanged at its upcoming meeting next week.

1157,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 10:12AM ET</span>",Last man standing: lonely Fed tightening spurs dollar surge,"By Saikat Chatterjee and Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - As speculation about interest rate rises and policy 'normalization' in the euro zone, Japan, Britain and China falls away rapidly, the U.S. Federal Reserve's now lonely monetary tightening has suddenly supercharged the dollar. 
The revival of the U.S. currency after more than a year on the wane is already causing mayhem in emerging markets from Turkey to Argentina and Indonesia, while tightening global financial conditions in a way that could eventually make even the Fed consider a pause for thought. 
In just two weeks the dollar has surged nearly four percent against a basket of the most traded currencies, erasing all the losses it had suffered since the start of 2018 (DXY). 
Against a broader group of currencies, including those from emerging markets, the greenback is now in positive territory against half of them.
Two factors may indicate the dollar's rise, which is potentially damaging to the world economy due to its pre-eminence as a global funding currency, has more room to run. (U.S. yield differentials support dollar: https://reut.rs/2IeomUK)
First is the interest rate gap. While the Fed left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, it is possibly set to raise them by a total of 75 basis points this year. This means U.S. rates are likely to pull still further ahead of all others in the developed world.(U.S., China surprise to the upside: https://reut.rs/2IaK3Fe)
The Fed's overnight lending rate in already in a target range of 1.50-1.75 percent compared with the European Central Bank's closely watched deposit rate benchmark at minus 0.4 percent while the Bank of Japan pledges to guide short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent.
Data on Thursday showing euro zone inflation slowing further last month could cement that view, especially after the Fed showed no sign of swerving from its tightening path after its policy meeting, calling recent U.S. inflation rises sustainable. (2018: Return of King Dollar?: https://reut.rs/2Ieod3E)(2017: Dollar in the dumps: https://reut.rs/2recuIQ)
The second factor is the record overhang of ""short"" dollar bets by speculators who believed the greenback would weaken. These amounted to nearly $24 billion as of end-April, as seen by positioning data, just off a $28 billion peak.
Such bets had multiplied by a factor of 10 in slightly more than a year based on a belief that other major economies, notably in Europe, would continue expanding at a faster pace than the United States, allowing central bankers to react faster than what markets were pricing in.
""The link-up in the yield differential and the dollar theme means the rally may have further room to run, especially against the euro and sterling as there is a big structural short dollar position in the market,"" said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers.(US financial conditions: https://reut.rs/2JQ5GrH)
Anecdotal evidence suggests short dollar bets may be far bigger, thanks to a slow moving allocation away from the greenback in recent years among large institutional investors. 
The dollar's rally this year is quite a turnaround from 2017 when it weakened against every other currency. 
Even in early 2018, most analysts were tipping greenback losses to escalate. The euro was on a roll, with the ECB looking set to roll back its economic stimulus in September and raise rates in the first quarter of 2019.(Last man standing: https://reut.rs/2rifa8m)
Similarly, sterling seemed to have left behind its Brexit-related worries due to expectations of two interest rate rises this year by the Bank of England. Likewise, the Japanese economy had enjoyed eight straight quarters of expansion, the longest such run since the 1980s. 
But a string of ominously weak data is causing speculation that the ECB may have to delay closing its bond buying program from September. Such data appears to have also scuppered a May rate rise in Britain while Japan ditched on April 27 its timeframe for hitting inflation targets, indicating no let-up in its stimulus. 
""Expectations for European and Japanese growth probably went too far, and we have seen a bit of loss of momentum,"" said Nick Wall, a portfolio manager at Old Mutual Global Investors, though he noted growth still remained robust in these regions.
China's central bank meanwhile has also contributed to dollar strength via liquidity injections into money markets and by cutting reserve requirement ratios for banks by 100 basis points in mid-April. 
""The addition of liquidity suggests to markets that the Chinese yuan trade-weighted index appreciation trend was set to pause, in turn suggesting implicit dollar strength,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts told clients.
Some other central banks, notably those in Switzerland and Sweden, have also turned more dovish, with the latter suggesting this week that more ""tools"" may be deployed to lift inflation.
""That indeed leaves the Fed as the only tightening game in town,"" Wall said.
The policy divergence is shown in bond markets where spreads between German yields and equivalent U.S. debt has blown out to its widest in three decades at 240 basis points. Similarly, the UK/U.S. yield gap widened this week to the most since 1984. 
Many people, including Wall, still see the dollar failing to extend its recent surge, given the United States needs a weaker currency to fix its deficit and the Fed's awareness of the knock-on effects on developing countries of a rampant dollar. 
But dollar appreciation could also feed more gains, should it persuade overseas investors to buy U.S. debt without hedging currency exposure. Asian funds have balked at buying Treasuries in recent months as higher U.S. rates raise hedging costs.
That shift to unhedged buying, a dramatic move for bond investors, could lead to more dollar purchases, Lombard Odier's Ahmed said.

(Reuters) - The specter of slower global economic growth presents another threat for Asian currencies, many of which are already under pressure from rising U.S. yields and capital outflows.
Recent economic data showing a cooling in Asian exports and in business activity in the United States and Europe, coupled with the risk that trade tensions will further undermine global supply chains, poses a risk to Asian currencies which had held up last year even as the Federal Reserve raised policy rates. 
""The strengthening in the global economy since second half of last year has supported Asian currencies and that was one of the reasons why they were largely able to brush off higher U.S. yields last year,"" said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ Banking Group.
""But with early signs that we could be seeing a peak in growth with March PMI numbers largely disappointing, there is a concern that 'if the growth start to slowdown, then that is one less supportive factor for Asian currencies'.""
Emerging Asian currencies performance: https://reut.rs/2rfEyvn
Moreover, unlike last year, when there were bursts of volatility in Treasury yields, this year's sustained rise in yields could force dollar borrowers to pull money out of emerging markets. That could embolden regional currency bears.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield breached the psychological level of 3 percent last month. However, its 20-day volatility is hovering near 8-year lows of 15.86 percent hit in April.
""At the beginning of the year, increased volatility discouraged foreign investment in U.S. bonds, including from Japan, but smoother rises in U.S. yields may attract foreign demand more easily,"" said Yujiro Goto, senior FX strategist at Nomura in a note. 
""As long as rises in foreign yields are smooth, further upside in dollar-yen and euro-yen is possible.""
The yield spread of Japanese and Thai bonds over U.S. Treasuries narrowed to a 11-year low last week, while Malaysian bond's spreads are hovering near a 4-1/2 year low hit in March. 
Asian bonds yield spreads over U.S.: https://reut.rs/2I5OtgB
With the Fed being the only major central bank set to raise interest rates in this quarter, most analysts expect further upside in U.S. bond yields.
The dwindling yield premium in emerging markets is already driving foreigners out of Asian bond and equity markets.
Data from seven Asian stock exchanges showed foreign outflows totaled about $3.5 billion in April, extending the year's tally to $8.2 billion. South Korea, India and Indonesian markets led the outflows last month.

Foreign flows into Asian bonds: https://reut.rs/2I1R1N1
Rising crude oil prices are a risk for currencies of the two net oil importers, India and Indonesia, which also have among the highest current account deficits in the region.
ANZ's Goh expects a varied performance for regional currencies for the rest of the year. 
He favors the Singapore dollar due to the central bank's recent tightening and the Thai baht for its higher current account surplus.

U.S. debt yields surged over the past two weeks on a sell-off in the bond market, while robust economic data in the United States, pulled the rug out from under riskier asset classes.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday indicated that inflation was nearing the central bank's target, and that it remained on track to raise borrowing costs in June.
As such, the dollar (DXY) gained against a basket of currencies, underpinned by the Fed's upward path for its benchmark interest rate.
ASIAN CURRENCIES TO RETREAT 
A stronger dollar bodes poorly for Asian currencies, as it will lure capital from the region's volatile markets to relatively safer assets in the United States.
A poll of 12 analysts reflected the shift in portfolios, as positions on most Asian currencies were pulled back.
Bearish bets on the Indian rupee  surged to their highest since August 2013, reflecting recent concerns about sustainable growth in the country.
India's infrastructure growth slowed to a three-year low of 4.2 percent in the fiscal year ending in March, indicating Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces a tough challenge to boost investment ahead of general elections due early next year.
Bullish bets on the Singapore dollar  fell to their lowest since November 2017. The currency shed about 1.1 percent to the dollar in April, its worst month since November 2016.
The city-state's fundamentals remain strong, however, with factory output growing more than expected in March while Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong painted a rosier picture of economic performance for 2018 this week.
Positions on the Taiwan dollar  turned bearish after more than nine months, cementing a recent downturn in the currency.
The Taiwan dollar saw April as its worst month in more than two years, and is poised to lose in May as well. 
An expected slowdown in global tech demand has also fueled speculation about whether recent strong growth in the technology sector can be sustained, as Taiwan's GDP growth slowed in the first quarter of 2018.
Bearish bets on Indonesia's rupiah  surged to their highest since November 2016, as it bore the brunt of a yield prompted sell-off. The rupiah is subject to a large amount of foreign exposure, with data from Bank Indonesia showing that foreigners held about 39 percent of Indonesian government bonds as at the end of March.
Indonesia's central bank has said it would intervene in the market if volatility in the rupiah got out of hand. 
EASING TENSIONS BENEFIT WON
On the other hand, bullish bets on the South Korean won  rose, as easing political tensions with its Northern neighbor reaffirmed confidence in the country. 
The leaders of North and South Korea signed a declaration last week agreeing to work for the ""complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,"" a pledge of peace following about six decades of conflict.
The news comes as a great relief for South Korean markets, which were rattled by escalated tensions following a barrage of missile tests by North Korea last year.
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.
The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

Australia’s rosy trade balance data also boosted the Aussie.
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies last stood at 92.39, down 0.22% at 11:15PM ET (03:15 GMT). The greenback reached this year’s new high overnight at 92.66, then lost its steam in the morning.
Meanwhile, the Fed kept the interest rate unchanged at 1.5% to 1.75%, as widely expected. It also said inflation is moving higher, close to its target.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.39% at 0.7523. Australia’s March trade balance data rose to A$1.53 billion versus A$0.65 billion expected - the largest surplus since May 2017. The Aussie was sent higher by the soaring trade balance data. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will be giving their Monetary Policy Statement on Friday, which market expects the interest rate will be kept unchanged at 1.5%. The RBA’s dovish tone may weigh on the Aussie.
The USD/JPY pair eased 0.18% to 109.64. Japan’s market closed for Constitution Day.
In China, the People's Bank of China set the set the reference rate for the yuan against the dollar, the mid-point from which the currency is allowed to trade, at 6.3732 versus the previous day's 6.3670. The USD/CNY pair edged 0.08% to trade at 6.3663.

1163,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 01:08AM ET</span>","Dollar slips from four-month high, awaits fresh catalysts after Fed","By Masayuki Kitano
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar traded below a four-month high against a basket of currencies on Thursday, with the focus shifting to economic data after the Federal Reserve did little to alter market expectations for further interest rate rises this year.
On Wednesday, the Fed left its benchmark overnight lending rate in a target range of between 1.50 percent and 1.75 percent as had been widely expected.
Its rate-setting committee said inflation had ""moved close"" to its target and that ""on a 12-month basis is expected to run near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.""
Analysts said the use of the word ""symmetric"" suggests that the Fed may allow inflation to run above its 2 percent target, a stance that would limit the need for the central bank to embark on a more aggressive path of monetary tightening in response to recent rises in inflation.
""The Fed is signaling it is keeping to the gradual path and not hiking rates at faster pace (at least for now),"" Alvin Liew, senior economist for UOB in Singapore, said in a note. 
After the Fed's policy statement, traders of U.S. short-term interest-rate futures on Wednesday kept bets the Fed will raise interest rates at least two more times this year. 
On Wednesday, the dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies had briefly slipped to around 92.245 after the Fed's policy statement but later regained its footing to set a four-month high of 92.834 -- marking a 4 percent gain from a trough touched in mid-April.
In Asian trade on Thursday, the dollar index stood at 92.508 (DXY), having slipped back from that four-month high.
With the Fed's meeting out of the way, focus is shifting to U.S. jobs data due on Friday for further indications of the strength of the economy and inflation pressures.
The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.1985 (EUR=), getting some respite after setting a near four-month low of $1.1938 on Wednesday.
A near-term focus for the common currency is euro zone inflation data due later on Thursday, said Mitul Kotecha, senior EM strategist for TD Securities in Singapore.
The euro could come under pressure if the data shows a slowdown in core inflation in the euro zone, Kotecha said, adding that the dollar could see further gains, at least in the near term.
The dollar has been buoyed in recent weeks by the strong U.S. economic outlook and rising yields amid signs of a slowdown in some other developed economies, especially in Europe. 
The dollar eased 0.2 percent to 109.65 yen , inching away from a three-month peak of 110.05 yen set on Wednesday.
The pace of the dollar's rise versus the yen has slowed somewhat, in the wake of the hefty gains seen since April, said Tareck Horchani, head of sales trading in Asia-Pacific for Saxo Markets in Singapore.
""The market is also probably pretty long (dollar/yen) now,"" Horchani said, adding that the dollar could face some downside risk against the yen, if U.S. equities come under pressure on Thursday.

Asian shares slipped as hopes waned for real progress in Sino-U.S. trade talks, which are due to kick off on Thursday.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.16% to 92.43, a five-month high.
Private payrolls grew by 204,000 in April, a decline from the 228,000 private jobs created in March, according to a report released Wednesday by ADP and Moody's Analytics. That beat economists’ forecast of 200,000.
Some said the upbeat ADP data – which often serves as a precursor to nonfarm payrolls – did little to boost expectations for a bullish nonfarm payrolls report due Friday amid seasonal weakness in the labour market.
""We still expect a below-consensus payrolls reading of 145,000 in total, with private payrolls up 140,000. We are allowing for a late start to spring in parts of the country delaying some seasonal hiring,"" HFE said.
The upbeat data on the U.S. labour market arrived ahead of Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision at 2PM ET, widely expected to remain unchanged.
Analysts said they expected the Fed to stick to its ongoing narrative of “gradual” rate hikes, acknowledging that inflation was closing in on the central’s bank target.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD fell 0.05% to $1.3607 as traders welcomed upbeat UK construction data. Sentiment on sterling, however, remained fairly negative as expectations for a Bank of England rate hike later this month has faded.

Demand for the dollar continued to be underpinned after data showing that U.S. private employers added 204,000 jobs in April, slightly higher than economists' expectations. The upbeat jobs data cemented expectations for a June rate hike by the Fed.
While the Fed is expected to keep interest rates on hold after its meeting later Wednesday policymakers are widely expected to line up their next rate hike in June against the backdrop of a strengthening U.S. economy.

The euro fell to fresh four month lows, with EUR/USD down 0.18% o 1.1972.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held near a four-month high against a basket of major currencies on Wednesday, buoyed by the outlook for a strong U.S. economy and rising yields amid signs of slowdown elsewhere, especially in Europe.
The dollar's index (DXY) (=USD) rose 0.66 percent on Tuesday and reached as high as 92.57, its firmest since Jan. 10. 
It rose above its 200-day moving average for the first time in a year, triggering a wave of short-covering.
While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep the benchmark interest rate on hold at its policy meeting ending on Wednesday, it looks certain to bump it up next month, given signs of possible acceleration in the U.S. economy.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey published on Tuesday showed U.S. factory activity slowed in April, but it highlighted shortages of skilled workers and rising costs, suggesting inflationary pressure is building.
Data published last month showed the Fed's favorite gauge of consumer inflation had jumped in March. 
""We are seeing a roll-back of dollar selling since the start of the year. If the upcoming U.S. jobs data shows gains in wage rises, that would propel the dollar higher,"" said Shinichiro Kadota, senior currency strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Capital in Tokyo.
Investors also think U.S. President Donald Trump's tax cuts and spending plans, unusual economic stimulus at a time of solid economic expansion, could further fuel inflation and prompt a faster pace of rate rises.
In contrast, expectations of rising rates are dwindling in Europe as recent economic figures suggest cooling momentum after stellar growth last year.
The British pound  fell to a four-month low of $1.3588 on Tuesday after soft UK manufacturing data, having fallen nearly 6 percent from a post-Brexit referendum high of $1.4377 hit on April 17. 
It was the latest in a run of mediocre economic data that further reduced the chances of a rate increase from the Bank of England when it meets next week.
Swap markets  now indicate around a 15 percent chance of a rate increase this month, down from 90 percent in early April.
The pound last stood at $1.3607, flat from late U.S. levels.
The euro fell to $1.1981 (EUR=), a low seen in mid-January and last stood at $1.1998.
The common currency also eased to 131.58 yen (EURJPY=), its lowest in three weeks, and last fetched 131.75 yen.
The flash estimate of the euro zone due at 0900 GMT is expected to show growth in the 19 country currency bloc slowing to 0.4 percent quarter-on-quarter in January-March from 0.6 percent in the preceding quarter.
While that would be hardly a bad figure, it would undermine the case for an earlier withdrawal of the European Central Bank's stimulus.
The dollar rose to as high as 109.89 yen , a three-month high and last changed hands at 109.85.

Elsewhere the Australian dollar  sank to an 11-month low of $0.74725 in overnight trade, while gold also hit a four-month low of $1,301.9 per ounce.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.62% to 92.20, a four-month high.

Manufacturing activity in April, meanwhile, was unchanged from the previous month, while construction spending unexpectedly fell 1.7%. 
Some analysts downplayed the weaker ISM manufacturing data, citing expectations for tax reform to support factory activity this year. 
“We continue to expect tax reform, particularly related to the accelerated depreciation of machinery and equipment will support factory activity this year,” CIBC said. 
The mostly negative economic reports come as the FOMC meeting gets underway later Tuesday, ahead of an interest rate decision, which will be accompanied by a monetary policy statement. 
The Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged and repeat its narrative of gradual rate hikes ahead of a widely expected June rate hike, Morgan Stanley said. 
“We expect the Fed to next hike rates at its June meeting, with little change in the ‘dots’ and forecasts. We continue to look for a total of three hikes this year, followed by a pause, and two additional hikes in 2019 where we think the hiking cycle ends,” Morgan Stanley said.
The greenback’s rally to a four-month high was helped by weakness in sterling after UK manufacturing activity in April fell to a 17-month low, further denting investor expectations for a Bank of England rate hike next month. 
GBP/USD fell 1.05% to $1.3621, while EUR/USD fell 0.50% to $1.2011.

1177,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2018 03:28AM ET</span>",Euro near three-and-a-half-month lows as dollar cements gains,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro fell on Tuesday, heading towards a 3-1/2 month low as weaker-than-expected economic data at the start of the week dented euro zone sentiment ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy decision.
The dollar has rallied in the last fortnight, helped by the 10-year Treasury yield topping 3 percent and a reconnection between higher interest rates and a buoyant currency. 
While markets don't expect a change in interest rates from the U.S. Federal Reserve at the conclusion of a meeting on Wednesday, analysts will be watching for any change in language. 
BNY Mellon strategists said in a note that if the Fed drops any cautionary comments on its inflationary outlook, then it would signal a growing confidence among policymakers that inflation has firmed up enough for an increase in forecasts.
Bond markets are expecting roughly three rate hikes until the end of the year.
That, combined with growing doubts about when the European Central Bank will move to slow its stimulus as the economy shows signs of peaking, have knocked the single currency lower.
The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.2058 (EUR=), not far from the $1.2055 it hit at the end of last week, the weakest level since mid-January.
The dollar rose 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies to 91.964 (DXY).
Markets are also focused on Friday's April U.S. non-farm payrolls report, which could provide further signs of strength in the world's biggest economy.
The greenback had risen 2 percent in April, its biggest monthly gain since November 2016, after the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) climbed above the psychologically significant 3.0 percent threshold to four-year highs last week.
The U.S. currency received its latest lift after the euro slumped on soft German March retail sales data.
""The euro's downturn is expected to continue in the near term amid receding prospects of the ECB embarking on monetary tightening,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
""With such themes weighing on its peers, the dollar looks well supported against the euro and pound, even without help from higher Treasury yields.""
European markets are closed on Tuesday for a public holiday.
The dollar was a shade higher at 109.43 yen .
The greenback climbed to a 2-1/2-month high of 109.540 yen on Friday as long-term U.S. yields rose. But it has lost momentum as Treasury yields have pulled back from four-year peaks. 
The Australian dollar traded flat  after dropping to $0.7525 on Monday, its lowest since Dec. 12.
The currency showed little response to the Reserve Bank of Australia's well anticipated decision on Tuesday to leave its cash rate unchanged at 1.50 percent.
Currencies such as the Australian and the New Zealand dollar, which previously enjoyed the support of relatively high interest rates, have declined as their yield advantages have been eroded, particularly against the dollar.
The New Zealand dollar extended its decline to touch $0.7029 , its lowest since Dec. 27. The kiwi fell nearly 3 percent in April.

1178,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 02:01PM ET</span>",Tale of Two Pesos Shows Investors Getting Burned by Politics,"(Bloomberg) -- The year started off brilliantly for Mexico’s peso. Same for Colombia’s. By the end of January, both had soared more than 5 percent. No other currency in the world, save Norway’s krone, was hotter than the pesos.
The reasons for the gains were different -- Colombia’s peso was up on surging oil, Mexico’s on optimism that Nafta renegotiation talks were going well -- but the implicit, underlying message in the rallies was the same: Investors weren’t worried about upcoming presidential elections.
That confidence seems to be wavering, especially in Mexico. The peso there plunged 4.9 percent in just five days in April as leftist candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, known as AMLO, showed no signs of squandering his 20-point lead in polls before the July 1 vote. Mexico’s currency is one of the four worst performers in emerging markets since the end of March, losing 3.2 percent.
“The probability of AMLO winning is going up and his speeches remain radical,” said Shamaila Khan, the director of emerging-market debt at AllianceBernstein LP, who’s cautious on Mexico’s peso and bonds. “We don’t think the market is fully pricing in the election risk.”
Even in Colombia, where investors are more confident that the unconventional outsider -- the former guerrilla Gustavo Petro -- will be defeated, the rally has stalled as the May 27 vote nears. Polls show that the lead held by Ivan Duque, a close ally of former president and market-darling Alvaro Uribe, is narrowing.
Lopez Obrador has the support of 47 percent of potential voters, far ahead of runner-up Ricardo Anaya, with 27 percent, and third-place former Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade, according to Bloomberg’s Poll Tracker. In Colombia, Petro trailed Duque by 10 percentage points in the most recent poll by Invamer, down from 19 points five weeks prior.
Investors are just waking up to the possibility that Lopez Obrador will not only win the presidency, but be able to cobble together a coalition of allies who could meld his most radical ideas into policies, Khan said. That could hurt Petroleos Mexicanos, which benefited from a recent overhaul of energy laws that stripped the state of its oil production monopoly. There’s also concern that his promised social spending could blow out the budget deficit.
While Lopez Obrador will probably moderate his platform after winning, Mexican assets could face short-term shocks, according to Jeff Grills, a money manager at Gramercy Funds, which oversees about $6 billion of emerging-market assets. That pessimism may eventually create a buying opportunity for longer-term investors akin to what happened after the brief global selloff following Donald Trump’s victory in November 2016. He’s more optimistic on Colombia.
In Brazil, the other major Latin American country holding elections this year, things have been rockier for the currency. After a brief January rally, it’s down 7.8 percent, in part on concern that October’s vote could produce a new government less committed to shoring up the country’s fiscal outlook.
Colombia’s peso is still the biggest gainer in emerging markets this year, up 6.7 percent. And while it’s down 0.2 percent since the end of March, that’s still one of the world’s best performances.
“It’s not keeping me up at night,” said Grills, who’s overweight Colombian assets and neutral on Mexico’s peso. He says Colombia’s proximity to the economic and social disasters in socialist-run Venezuela will push voters away from radical politics.
“The desire for purely populist policies -- especially in Colombia -- is quite low,” he said.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.38% to 94.66 after hitting a session high of 91.70. The dollar was on track to post its biggest monthly gain in more than a year.
The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, rose 1.9% in the 12 months through March, nearly matching the Fed’s 2% target.
Personal income and spending, meanwhile, rose 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively, in March. 
The uptick in inflation comes a day before the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) is slated to begin its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. But some market participants have downplayed the prospect of more aggressive language on monetary policy tightening appearing in the Fed’s policy statement on Wednesday.
Stifel said Monday the Fed would require more evidence of sustained 2% inflation in the months to come to conclude that it its price objective has been achieved, paving the way for further tightening of monetary policy.
“Ahead of the June FOMC meeting, April and May inflation readings will also need to indicate the Fed has clearly met the Committee’s price objective. Without clear evidence of such, it will be difficult for the Fed to move ahead with a further removal of accommodation in the near-term,” Stifel said.
According to investing.com’s fed rate monitor tool, 94% of traders expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged on Wednesday. The prospect of a fourth rate hike in December, however, was just under 50% following a dramatic rise in recent weeks.
The housing sector, meanwhile, remained subdued as the National Association of Realtors’ pending home sales index rose just 0.4% to a reading of 107.2 in March.
Also supporting the dollar was ongoing weakness in the both the pound and euro.
GBP/USD fell 0.18% to $1.3757 as investors continued to cut bets on a Bank of England rate hike next month following a string of softer economic data including first-quarter GDP released last week that undershot economists’ forecasts.
EUR/USD fell 0.46% to $1.2075 amid a slump in German retail sales.

1182,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 07:02AM ET</span>","Pimco Sees Cold Currency War Reigniting, Pushing Dollar Higher","(Bloomberg) -- The resumption of a “cold currency war” among global central banks could trigger a stronger dollar, Pacific Investment Management Co. said.
The Trump administration’s protectionist policies now face a counterattack from European and Asian policy makers, said Joachim Fels, Pimco’s global economic adviser, who defines a “cold” conflict as one fought with words and covert action rather than outright currency intervention. Their weapon? Just as the Federal Reserve heads determinedly down the tightening path, peers including the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank are turning dovish.
“The empire of non-U.S. central banks has started to strike back,” Fels said in a research note. “If continued, this could lead to a counter-rally of the U.S. dollar in the remainder of this year.”
The conflict began when President Donald Trump took office in early 2017 and immediately sought a lower dollar to boost America’s competitive position; Europe and Asia largely acquiesced to this for fear of a worse alternative: the erection of trade barriers. But now that the U.S. is pressing ahead with tariffs anyway, the gloves are off for its opponents, Fels said.
He cites the recent walk back from plans for withdrawal of stimulus by the BOJ, ECB and the Bank of England, as well as China’s decision to ease its reserve requirements. Moreover, with Japan racked by political scandal and the French-German push for banking and fiscal union in limbo, both will be relying even more on their central banks to tide over their respective economies.
“With the Fed seemingly determined to keep raising interest rates in response to fiscal stimulus while other central banks are turning more dovish, a stronger dollar may now be in the making,” Fels said. “And if so, the U.S. administration is likely to strike back at some stage. In short, the cold currency war is here to stay.”

1185,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 01:12AM ET</span>",Dollar below three-month highs as U.S. 10-year yield pulls back,"By Masayuki Kitano
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar held steady against a basket of major currencies on Monday after pulling back slightly from a 3-1/2-month high last week, pressured by a decline in the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield.
The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 91.561 (DXY), steady on the day but down from Friday's high of 91.986, its strongest level since Jan. 11.
The dollar index had risen more than 1.3 percent last week for its biggest weekly gain in over two months, after the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose above the psychologically key 3.0 percent threshold to four-year highs.
The U.S. 10-year yield has since come off that peak and fell 3 basis points on Friday to 2.957 percent (US10YT=RR), down from a four-year high of 3.035 percent struck on Wednesday.
Earlier this year, the correlation between U.S. yields and the dollar had broken down as investors focused more on trade frictions and geopolitical issues. Markets, however, have recently turned their attention back to interest rate plays as concerns over the U.S.-China trade dispute and tensions over North Korea's nuclear program eased, giving the greenback a leg up.
The dollar inched up 0.1 percent to 109.12 yen, having set a 2-1/2 month high of 109.54 yen on Friday. But trade was thin with Japanese markets closed for a holiday.
The dollar has risen more than 2.6 percent against the yen in April, putting it on track for its best monthly performance since November 2016. 
""The dollar has come a long way, and my sense is that it doesn't have the strength to break above 110 yen for now,"" said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore.
At the same time, with concerns over geopolitical risks easing, the dollar's downside risks against the yen also appear limited, Okagawa said, adding that the greenback was unlikely to fall back to the 107-yen handle in the near term.
Some analysts say moves among Japanese investors to increase their foreign currency exposure at the start of Japan's new financial year have likely contributed to the yen's weakness in April.
Another factor that is seen as having weighed on the yen recently is speculation about the potential for eventual yen-selling flows related to Japanese drugmaker Takeda Pharmaceutical's (T:4502) $64 billion bid to buy London-listed  Shire  Plc (L:SHP).
Events and data coming up this week include the U.S. Federal Reserve's May 1-2 policy meeting, at which the central bank is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged, as well as U.S. jobs data due on Friday.
""This week's U.S. non-farm payroll number will go a long way to cementing the dollar's near-term trend,"" Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore, said in a note.
In addition, a delegation of U.S. officials, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and President Donald Trump's top economic and trade advisers - Larry Kudlow, Robert Lighthizer and Peter Navarro - are all expected in China later this week for trade negotiations.
The euro held steady at $1.2125 (EUR=), having recovered from a 3-1/2-month low of $1.2055 set on Friday.
Sterling eased 0.1 percent to $1.3780 .

The Fed is unlikely to raise rates at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday after a hike in March, but the central bank’s statement will be closely watched amid speculation over whether it will raise rates four times this year, rather than the three signaled by policy makers.
Meanwhile, Friday’s U.S. employment report is expected to show that wage growth cooled despite a pickup in jobs growth last month.
In the euro zone, Wednesday’s flash estimate of first quarter growth and Thursday’s inflation data for April are likely to confirm that the economy has moderated since the start of the year.
In the UK, investors will be looking at surveys on private sector activity for indications on how the economy fared at the start of the second quarter after data on Friday showing that Britain’s economy slowed sharply in the first quarter further dampened rate hike bets.
Another report on Friday showed that the U.S. economy slowed in the first quarter, but this was offset by an increase in wage growth.
The dollar eased from three-and-a-half month highs against a currency basket following the report, with the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, dipping 0.09% to 91.31 in late trade.
The index still ended the week up 1.37%, its largest weekly percentage gain since early February.
The dollar was boosted after the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose above 3% for the first time since 2014 last week, a sign of confidence in the outlook for the U.S. economy.
The euro pushed higher late Friday, with EUR/USD rising 0.22% to 1.2131 after falling to 1.2056 earlier, its weakest level since January 12. The pair ended the week down 1.28%.
The dollar was also lower against the yen, with USD/JPY sliding 0.23% to 109.04 in late trade after hitting a high of 109.54 earlier, the most since February 8.

1188,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 02:31PM ET</span>",Argentina Jolts FX Traders by Hiking Rate Above 30% to Buoy Peso,"(Bloomberg) -- Argentina’s central bank shook local markets by raising its key interest rate, a surprise move aimed at stemming a record decline in the currency and restoring credibility to its inflation-fighting credentials.
The seven-day repo rate was increased 3 percentage points to 30.25 percent effective immediately, the central bank said in a statement, adding that the objective of the decision was to contain inflation that is near 25 percent. The move was all the more unexpected because policy makers had held borrowing costs in a meeting on Tuesday. The bank said it will act again if necessary.
""They confused the market this week, and they’re paying for that mistake now,"" said Edwin Gutierrez, head of emerging-market sovereign debt at Aberdeen Standard Investments in London. ""We all know that they don’t have endless firepower.""
Central bank President Federico Sturzenegger has now puzzled markets twice since December, when the government eased the inflation target allowing officials to pursue looser monetary policy to help bolster a nascent economic recovery. The decision was ""poorly communicated"" and was followed by an ill-timed and controversial 150 basis point rate cut in January in the face of a sharp deterioration of inflation expectations, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said at the time.
What followed was a free fall of the peso, making it the worst performing major currency this year. The bank spent more than $3 billion this week, or about 5 percent of reserves, to defend the peso as it hit a record low. Those efforts weren’t enough to offset global pessimism toward riskier assets, renewed dollar strength and an exodus of overseas investors from Argentina after a new income tax for foreigners took effect this week.
The peso, which had fallen as much as 1.8 percent earlier in the day, closed 0.1 percent higher at 20.54 per dollar. Still, its 10 percent plunge this year is the worst among major currencies, and trails only the Angolan kwanza and Venezuelan bolivar globally.
“The pressure on the FX led to a situation where there was a need to give a message to foreign markets,” said Alejo Costa, the head of strategy at BTG Pactual Argentina. “They needed to give a strong additional policy signal.”
The central bank’s spot-market intervention this week accelerated from just $2 billion spent in the entire year until Monday. Analysts questioned how much more the central bank wanted to spend on intervention with downward pressure on the peso mounting.
Policy makers are concerned that a weaker peso will fuel inflation that’s already running at an annual pace of 25 percent. President Mauricio Macri has made slowing price increases one of his top priorities since he took office in late 2015 vowing to jumpstart investment. But that goal has often conflicted with another top goal: ensuring robust economic growth.
The hike is a boon for investors like Gutierrez, who hold local assets, and have benefited from the highest local rates in the world, now 300 basis points higher, and from a stable currency thanks to the central bank’s participation in the market starting in March.
""We still like the medium-term story, but the confused policy and conflict among the economic team has not been positive, and we’re now seeing the end product of that conflict,"" he said. ""It remains to be seen whether this is enough. That remains a function of what inflation looks like in coming months.""
Even after the plunge this year, the country’s real effective exchange rate -- the purchasing power adjusted for inflation -- suggests that the peso may still have further to fall. The peso’s equilibrium value should be at 22.45 per dollar, analysts at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) wrote in a note yesterday that highlighted intervention in the currency market as ""a band-aid to a more structural problem."" That’s above the end-year forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, who expect the peso to end the year at 21.4 per dollar.

1189,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",Forex - GBP/USD Slump Eases Dollar Losses ,"Investing.com – The dollar hovered above session lows against a basket of major currencies on Friday after U.S. economic growth slowed in the first quarter of the year but losses were limited by a plunge in the pound. 
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.08% to 91.47, but remained close to session lows of 91.30. 
The Commerce Department Friday released its preliminary reading of first-quarter gross domestic product showing the U.S. economy expanded at a 2.3% annual rate as consumer spending slumped.
Yet analysts remained optimistic that economic growth will rebound in the second quarter of the year, as the first-quarter growth weakness is somewhat of a common occurance. 
U.S. economic growth will be better in second quarter as the long-running seasonal adjustment problem in the GDP data means Q1 growth was likely understated, Pantheon said. “We estimate that the average error is 0.9%.” 
Weakness in the dollar was limited, however, by a sharp plunge in sterling after UK first-quarter economic growth fell well short of economists’ estimates, further denting investor hopes that the Bank of England will raise interest rates next month. 
GBP/USD fell 0.98% to $1.3781. 
EUR/USD fell 0.16% to 1.2101. This comes a day after the European Central Bank president Mario Draghi delivered a mixed message on the Eurozone economy on Thursday. Draghi admitted that the pace of the Eurozone recovery had moderated broadly across all countries but reaffirmed his confidence that inflation would eventually hit the bank’s target.

1190,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 09:32AM ET</span>",Forex – Dollar Hits Fresh 3 ½ Month High as GDP Slows Less Than Feared,"Investing.com – The dollar jumped to a fresh three-and-a-half month high on Friday after data showed that economic growth in the U.S. slowed less than feared.
At 9:28AM ET (13:28GMT), the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.21% to 91.58, close to session highs of 91.79, its highest level since January 11.
The move came as preliminary data showed that gross domestic product grew 2.3% in the first quarter. Although that marked a slowdown from the prior 2.9%, it marked the best start to a year since 2015 and beat expectations for a slower expansion of just 2.0%.
The dollar was on track for weekly gains of 1.7%, its best performance since November 2016 as higher U.S. Treasury yields and expectations of a more aggressive tightening by the Federal Reserve lent support.
In other pairs with the greenback, GBP/USD fell 1.00% to 1.3779, an eight week low. The pound had already been under pressure after data released earlier on Friday the UK registered an expansion of just 0.1% in the first three months of 2018, missing the forecast 0.3% growth and markedly lower than the 0.4% growth seen in the final three months of 2017.
EUR/USD succumbed to dollar strength and traded down 0.17% to 1.2083. The euro zone also saw first quarter growth in France and Spain slow more than expected in data released Friday just one day after the European Central Bank held steady on monetary policy.
The yen was seeing less downside against the dollar on Friday with USD/JPY slipping just 0.03% to 109.26. That was despite the fact that the Bank of Japan left its monetary stimulus program unchanged on Friday, as expected, but removed previous wording on reaching its 2% inflation around fiscal 2019.
Some analysts suggested that sentiment in the yen received a boost from the news of a historic peace agreement between North and South Korea. In a joint declaration, both leaders confirmed the common goal of realizing, through complete denuclearization, a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and declared that “there will be no more war on the Korean Peninsula and thus a new era of peace has begun”.
Lastly, in another exception to dollar strength, USD/CAD inched down 0.02% to 1.2868."
1191,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 12:14AM ET</span>",Forex – Dollar Slides; Bank of Japan Speaks And Two Koreas Meet,"Investing.com – The dollar slipped in Friday morning trade although it remained above the 91 mark. Focus of the day for the Asian currency market was on the lacklustre economic data from Japan, Bank of Japan (BOJ)’s interest rate decision and the inter-Korean summit.
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies last stood at 91.31, down 0.09% at 11:53PM ET (03:53 GMT).
Despite a small drop in late morning, the greenback climbed to a new high earlier on Friday, breaking the 91 mark since early 2018. Although yields of U.S. 10-year Treasuries retreated to below the 3% mark on Thursday, it still fueled the dollar’s momentum.
The USD/JPY pair eased 0.10% to 109.19. The yen held firm against the dollar despite a slew of worse-than-expected data, with Tokyo CPI for April coming at 0.5% versus the estimated 0.8% and March retail sales figures at 1.0% versus the expected 1.5%. The yen also reacted little to the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy statement, which indicated inflation is unlikely to hit 2% as targeted.
BOJ delivered its much anticipated decision on monetary policy in late morning in Asia without mentioning the timeframe for achieving the 2% inflation target. The move suggested that the target will likely remain out of reach in the near future, as the Bank kept its inflation forecast for the next fiscal year unchanged at 1.8%.
The AUD/USD pair steadied at 0.7555. The Australian producer price index came out at 0.5% quarter-on-quarter, beating the expected 0.4%, but the upbeat reading did not translate into bulls for the Aussie, which is still at a one-month low against the dollar.
The USD/KRW pair dropped 0.16% to 1,076.02. The historic summit between North Korea and South Korea on Friday morning tamed the geopolitical tensions in East Asia, lifting up the sentiment for the won. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un hailed a “new era of peace”.
In China, the People's Bank of China set the fix rate of yuan against the dollar at 6.3393 versus the previous day's 6. 3283. The USD/CNY pair eased 0.37% to trade at 6.3361.

1192,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 09:20PM ET</span>","Dollar at three-and-a-half month high on elevated yields, euro soft after ECB","By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held near a 3-1/2-month high against a basket of currencies on Friday as higher U.S. yields have prompted unwinding of big short positions in the currency while the euro was hampered by a dovish tone from the European Central Bank.
The dollar's index against six major currencies (DXY) hit a high of 91.639, its strongest level since mid-January as investors have warmed to the greenback thanks to attractive Treasury yields.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries (US10YT=RR) had hit the psychologically important three percent mark on combination of worries about inflation and increased debt supplies as a result of President Donald Trump's tax cuts and spending plans.
Earlier this year, the correlation between U.S. yields and the dollar broken down as investors focused more on trade frictions and geopolitical issues, with currencies largely driven by Trump's tweets than by economic data and yields.
But so far this week, as concerns over U.S.-China trade tensions have ebbed somewhat, the markets have turned their attention to interest rate plays.
In addition, speculators' net dollar short position in currency futures in Chicago , a closely-watched indicator on market positioning, had hit a 6-1/2-year high, suggesting some short-covering will be due.
""There is an element of positioning unwind underpinning the recent dollar strength... The currencies that had the largest net long positions against the dollar are the ones that have declined the most,"" wrote analysts at ANZ wrote.
The euro, in which speculators had a record long position, fell to $1.20965 (EUR=) in the previous session, its lowest level since Jan. 12. It last stood at $1.21805, and is down 1.5 percent on the week.
The common currency slid on Thursday after ECB chief Mario Draghi acknowledged evidence of a ""pull-back"" from exceptional growth readings seen around the turn of the year, although the central bank sought to bolster expectations for a gradual withdrawal of its monetary stimulus.
The dollar changed hands at 109.33 yen , having risen to a 2-1/2-month high of 109.49 yen earlier in the week. So far this week, it has gained 1.5 percent.
The yen's weakness is likely to reflect expectations of yen-selling as drugmaker Takeda Pharmaceutical (T:4502) is pushing to buy London-listed  Shire  (L:SHP) in a $64 billion deal, which would be the biggest Japanese acquisition of a foreign company.
""Given the May 8 deadline of the deal, you would need to be really courageous to go long on the yen until then,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.
In contrast, the pound has been relatively well-supported . It last stood at $1.3915 , down 0.6 percent so far this week.
Against the yen, it was fetching 152.14 yen (GBPJPY=), up 0.9 percent this week.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar  hit a 4-1/2-month low of $0.75465.

The Swedish crown weakened, hitting its lowest level since November 2009 against the euro (EURSEK=), after the Swedish central bank Riksbank pushed back its rate hike plan due to worries about sluggish inflation.

1193,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 02:31PM ET</span>",Brazil Traders Just Made a Huge Bet in Currency Options Market,"(Bloomberg) -- Brazil options traders seem to be gearing up for a sudden surge in currency volatility.
Investors bought $1.4 billion of contracts Tuesday that will pay off if the real swings significantly over the next week from its current price near 3.5 per dollar, already the lowest in 11 months. Trading volume was 25 times the average over the past two weeks, according to data from the exchange. Just seven trades were recorded, indicating the buyers were making large wagers.
While investor anxiety in Brazil has been focused on the October presidential elections, which some analysts fear could derail the painful overhauls needed to shore up the budget, the surge in options buying suggests the concern is more near term.
One possible worry is that upcoming testimony from Antonio Palocci, a finance minister under jailed former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, will implicate new companies in the massive Carwash graft scandal that’s roiled Brazil over the past three years. Investors may also be concerned that a recent Supreme Court move will give Lula, who is currently in jail on corruption charges, a chance at getting out in time to seek another term in office.
“That would cause a market panic,” said James Gulbrandsen, a Rio de Janeiro-based money manager who helps oversee $3.5 billion at NHC Capital and has bought protection against a selloff in Brazilian equities. “I suspect larger players are hedging against that possibility.”
Brazilian investor anxiety, as measured by the real’s one-week implied volatility, hit the highest since early this year the day after the positioning change in USD/BRL call options with a 3.5 per dollar strike price that expire April 30. The real has dropped 10 percent since late January, the worst performance in the world after Russia’s ruble."

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.37% to 91.39.
The US 10-year treasury yield slipped below 3% as a plunge in the 10-year treasury price - which trades inversely to the yield - over recent sessions attracted a wave of buying.
Higher bond yields had boosted the dollar to multi-month highs this week as investors bet on a faster pace of Federal Reserve rate hikes amid optimism on sustained inflation and economic growth.
A plunge in the euro, however, kept the dollar rally intact after European Central Bank president Mario Draghi delivered a mixed message on the Eurozone economy.
Following the European Central Bank’s widely expected decision to leave monetary policy unchanged, Draghi admitted that the pace of the Eurozone recovery had moderated broadly across all countries but reaffirmed his confidence that inflation would eventually hit the bank’s target.
EUR/USD fell 0.39% to $1.2113.
The dollar was also boosted by mostly positive economic data as jobless claims and the advance goods trade balance topped expectations while durable goods fell short.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday Core Durable Goods Orders rose 0.00% last month, missing economist forecast for a 0.5% rise.
Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, fell 0.1% last month after an downwardly revised 0.9% in February.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims dropped by 24,000 to a seasonally adjusted 209,000 for the week ended April 20, beating economists’ forecast for a drop to 230,000.
GBP/USD traded flat at $1.3927, while USD/CAD rose 0.16% to C$1.2864.
USD/JPY fell 0.16% to 109.25 ahead of the eagerly awaited Bank of Japan monetary policy decision and press conference from BoJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar traded near a 3-1/2-month high against a basket of currencies on Thursday, bolstered by higher U.S. Treasury yields, led by the 10-year benchmark breaching the 3 percent threshold this week for the first time in four years. 
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) set a fresh four-year high of 3.035 percent on Wednesday, driven by worries about the growing supply of government debt and inflationary pressures from rising oil prices. 
A rise to levels beyond 3.041 percent would take the U.S. benchmark 10-year yield to its highest since July 2011. The recent jump in U.S. bond yields has caused U.S.-Japan and U.S.-German yield differentials to widen further in the dollar's favor, leaving the yen and the euro lower.
""Unless there is a very unlikely massive meltdown in U.S. equity markets, it is doubtful the Fed will waver on a June rate hike,"" Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore wrote in a note.
""With equity market sentiment holding firm in the face of rising bond yields, the almighty dollar could move through G-10 currency markets like a wrecking ball,"" Innes added. 
The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies was at 91.136 (DXY), having risen to a high of 91.261 on Wednesday, its strongest since Jan. 12. 
Wall Street limped into positive territory on Wednesday on optimism over a spate of upbeat earnings, although that was nearly offset by jitters over rising U.S. bond yields and corporate costs. 
The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.2179 (EUR=) but was still within sight of a near two-month low of $1.2160 set on Wednesday. 
The near-term focus is on the European Central Bank's rates review due later on Thursday.
The ECB is set to keep policy unchanged on Thursday, playing down worries over recent softness in the euro zone economy and leaving the door open to ending its lavish bond purchase scheme by the close of the year.
YEN'S APRIL WOES 
Against the yen, the dollar set a 2-1/2-month high of 109.49 yen but later eased to 109.30 yen , down 0.1 percent.
The dollar may soon test some key technical levels near 110 yen, said Teppei Ino, analyst for MUFG Bank in Singapore. 
One key level for the dollar is 109.65 yen, a 50 percent retracement of its November to March decline, and another is its 200-day moving average near 110.27 yen, Ino said. 
So far in April, the dollar has gained 2.8 percent against the yen, putting it on track for its biggest monthly gain since November 2016.
The yen's recent weakness has probably been driven in part by Japanese investors increasing their exposure to foreign currencies at the start of Japan's new financial year, said Sim Moh Siong, FX strategist for Bank of Singapore.
Still, the yen may see its near-term losses limited at around 110 per dollar, Sim said. 
The Japanese currency likely holds attraction for overseas investors looking to diversify their currency allocations, given that the yen's real effective exchange rate -- its trade-weighted and inflation adjusted exchange rate -- still appears relatively cheap on a longer-term basis, Sim said. 

""Yen will be valuable as a diversifier,"" he added.

Turkey’s central bank defied expectations Wednesday by raising its late liquidity window, the rate it uses to set bank funding costs, by a greater-than-anticipated 75 basis points. The lira immediately advanced as much as 1.3 percent, but then the euphoria evaporated, and by 5:49 p.m. in Istanbul, it was 0.3 percent weaker at 4.0966 per dollar. The main stock gauge extended its decline to 2.3 percent.
For investors such as GAM UK Ltd. and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), the currency’s rapid reversal underlines how policy makers are failing to deal with the issues that led to rising inflation and a widening current-account deficit.

The yen and the Aussie were both weighed down by the yield-fueled greenback.
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies last stood at 90.60, up 0.04% at 11:32PM ET (03:32 GMT).
As the U.S.-China trade conflict woes receded, global investors all eyed the rising United States 10-Year in recent days that surged to 3% on Tuesday, a new high since early 2014. The increase was driven by fears of rising inflation and speculations that the Federal Reserve will be more aggressive in raising interest rates in 2018.
The yield is a barometer for mortgage rates and other financial instruments. Higher yields could lead to higher mortgage and business loan interest rates, as well as reduced spending that would push stocks lower.
The USD/JPY pair gained 0.10% to 108.93. While a bearish equity market was often supportive for the anti-risk yen, the yen lost to the greenback that was sent higher by the yields. The spread between the 10-year US treasury yield and 10-year Japanese government bond yield also stood at 294 basis points, the widest since 2007.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar hit a four-month high on Wednesday after a rise in benchmark U.S. Treasury yields above 3 percent rattled some currency bears while a mixed picture from business surveys failed to help the euro before a European Central Bank meeting.
Asian shares fell on Wednesday after a sharp sell-off in U.S. markets and warnings from U.S. companies of higher costs drove fears that a boom in corporate earnings may be near its peak when concerns of fiscal stimulus in a late U.S. economic cycle have pushed bond yields higher. 
""With rising bond yields spoiling the fun and disappointment around the U.S. tech sector putting a dampener on sentiment, hopes are pinned on earnings delivering,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) macro strategist Kit Juckes.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies (DXY) rose 0.4 percent to 91.093. It had climbed overnight to 91.076, highest since Jan. 12, before a slide in Wall Street stocks tempered investor risk appetite.
Against the yen, the dollar neared a two-month high of 109.20 yen hit in the previous session . It was a notch below that at 109.18 yen, up 0.3 percent on the day.
The greenback had risen without pause through much of the past week as U.S.-China trade conflict fears receded and allowed the market to turn its attention back to dollar-supportive fundamentals, notably the surge by U.S. yields.
The dollar squeeze has been most severe against those currencies heavily backed by speculative investors including the British pound, New Zealand dollar and Mexican peso.
Investors are focused on the euro-dollar exchange rate which has remain stuck in its recent range.
Analysts say the market needs clarity about the speed of the European Central Bank's monetary tightening cycle before the euro, which rallied at the start of this year before running out of steam in the last two months, breaks higher.
The ECB holds its monetary policy meeting on Thursday.
The euro stormed into 2018 in rally mode as traders bet that synchronized global growth would force the ECB to accelerate monetary policy normalization.
But the ECB's reluctance so far to signal any shift leaves the ""euro's gains against the dollar vulnerable to setbacks"", said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Thu Lan Nguyen in a note. 
Nguyen said that the euro-dollar exchange rate continues to be dominated mainly by moves in the US dollar that is now beginning to benefit from higher US interest rates.
This week the gap between U.S. and German 10-year government bond yields has hit its widest in 29 years and the U.S.-Japanese 10-year yield spread (US10YT=RR) reached its broadest in nearly 11 years.
The treasury yield extended its overnight rise and touched the four-year peak of 3.009 percent, reflecting the durability of the U.S. economic expansion. Accelerating inflation and concerns about increasing debt supply have also driven yields higher. 
The pound was down 0.2 percent at $1.3947 . It plumbed a one-month low of $1.3919 on Tuesday before rebounding 0.3 percent, on news about a possible takeover of British pharmaceutical company  Shire  Plc (L:SHP) by Japanese drugmaker Takeda Pharmaceutical Co (T:4502). 
The Australian dollar shed 0.4 percent to $0.7569  as it dropped into a four-month trough. 
The New Zealand dollar extended losses and dipped to $0.7102 NZD=D4, its weakest since Jan. 4.

The Canadian dollar performed a little better on headlines citing Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland that ""good progress"" was being made on NAFTA negotiations.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin rose to a six-week high on Tuesday on positive headlines that included the possible entry of major financial institutions into the space, lifting sentiment on the overall cryptocurrency market.
The virtual currency gained after a brutal 50 percent loss in the first quarter of the year, following a nearly 1,400 percent surge in 2017.
On Tuesday, bitcoin climbed in six of the last seven sessions. It was last up 4.4 percent at $9,340.88 on the Bitstamp platform.
Bitcoin's gains also increased demand for other cryptocurrencies such as ripple and ethereum, pushing the market capitalization of all digital currencies to $427 billion, according to cryptocurrency tracker coinmarketcap.com. That is the largest market cap since early March.
""The space has remained relatively stable over the past several weeks and crypto markets are reacting with resilience as people start to gain a more nuanced understanding of the long-term potential of blockchain technology,"" said Rob Viglione, co-founder of ZenCash, a coin that promises privacy for borderless, decentralized communications and transactions. 
Blockchain, a digital ledger of transactions, underpins cryptocurrencies in general and can be used to track, record, and transfer assets across all industries.
News that major financial institutions are becoming more bullish about the space has also bolstered the confidence of retail investors, Viglione added.
Numerous media outlets reported that Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) [GSGSC.UL] enlisted Justin Schmidt, a former trader, to be the first head of digital asset markets in the company's securities division. Reports also said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) PLC [BARCR.UL] has been gauging interest from its clients about launching a cryptocurrency trading desk.
Reuters also reported on Tuesday that one in five financial institutions is considering trading cryptocurrencies within the next 12 months, according to a survey published by Thomson Reuters.
Among those respondents who said they were willing to trade cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, 70 percent said they were planning to start trading in the next three to six months, the survey showed.
""I think the public catching wind of news that Goldman Sachs and other financial powerhouses are not just showing interest but pro-actively hiring and investing in the crypto markets is instilling a positive sentiment across the board,"" said Josh McIver, chief executive officer of ULedger, a blockchain technology company.
A total of $28 billion has changed hands over the last 24 hours, the largest trading volume since Feb. 10, analysts said. 

That said, market participants pointed out that challenges in the cryptocurrency space such as increased regulatory focus are not going away any time soon and may take a long time to resolve.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar set a three-month high against a basket of currencies on Tuesday, having gained a boost as the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield climbed toward the psychologically key 3 percent level.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield hit its highest in more than four years at 2.998 percent (US10YT=RR) on Monday, driven by worries about the growing supply of government debt and inflationary pressures from rising oil prices.
The U.S. 10-year bond yield later backed off that level and stood at 2.964 percent in Tuesday's Asian trade.
Yields have also risen at the short end of the curve, with the U.S. 2-year yield having reached a high of 2.483 percent (US2YT=RR) this week, the highest since September 2008.
As a result, U.S.-Japan and U.S.-German yield differentials have recently widened in the dollar's favor, leaving the yen and the euro lower.
""The U.S. dollar has put on a compelling show...as the stars align on the back of higher U.S. yields,"" Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore, wrote in a note.
""While it's a bit early for investors to pack in the consensus short dollar view, the weaker shorts are indeed getting pared,"" he added.
The dollar's index against a basket of six major peers rose to as high as 91.076 (DXY), its strongest since Jan. 12. The dollar index was last steady on the day at 90.929.
The dollar set a two-month high of 108.87 yen  and last stood at 108.82 yen, up 0.1 percent on the day.
On Monday, the dollar had surged nearly 1 percent for its biggest daily percentage rise in almost a month, gaining added steam after breaching the 108 yen level.
""The break of 108 triggered a lot of stops and buying interest on the options market as well,"" said Tareck Horchani, head of sales trading in Asia-Pacific for Saxo Markets in Singapore, referring to the dollar's jump on Monday.
The yen, a safe haven currency that tends to rise in times of economic uncertainty but weakens when investor confidence returns, has come under pressure in recent sessions as worries over geopolitical risks and global trade tensions eased.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday he may travel to China, a move that could ease tensions between the world's two largest economies.
The euro held steady at $1.2209 (EUR=), having pared its losses after falling to $1.2185 earlier on Tuesday, the lowest for the common currency since March 1. 
The rise in U.S. bond yields has dented emerging market currencies and bond markets, including those in Asia.
Higher U.S. yields can put pressure on the currencies of emerging market countries that run current account deficits such as Indonesia and India, said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore.
Although its moves were subdued on Tuesday, the Indonesian rupiah  briefly touched a two-year low of 13,898 per dollar.
In one-month non-deliverable forwards (NDFs), the rupiah  hit a two-year low of 14,105 per dollar before regaining its footing.

Market participants said foreign investors may have been buying the dollar against the rupiah via NDFs in recent trading sessions to hedge against the risk of further dollar appreciation.

It’s a stark reversal that took hold over the past week, coming after the peso posted the biggest global gains in the first quarter amid optimism the country would reach a favorable outcome in trade talks with the U.S. and Canada. Now, traders are refocusing on the political outlook before the July 1 election, and see Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador coasting to victory.
That view was cemented Sunday night during the first debate, when Lopez Obrador -- who is known for a quick temper -- played it safe as rivals attacked his security and economic policies. That disappointed investors who hoped the confrontations would make the front-runner stumble. Lopez Obrador now has a more than 20 percentage point lead over the No.2 candidate, Ricardo Anaya, who failed to inflict much in the way of damaging blows.
“Finally, it looks like it’s being priced in,” said Christian Lawrence, a currency strategist at Rabobank in New York. “International markets have woken up to the looming election.”
The peso has lost 4.5 percent over the past five days after it reached the highest closing level in six months April 16, and traded at about 18.85 per dollar as of 1:23 p.m. in New York. The currency broke through its 100-day moving average earlier in the day, a sign to some technical investors that more losses may be coming.
Traders are concerned that Lopez Obrador could roll back the historic opening of the energy industry to foreign investment and that his pledges to increase social spending would blow out the budget deficit. The 64-year-old former mayor of Mexico City is making his third run at the presidency after losing narrowly in 2006 and by a wider margin in 2012.
“The combination of recent USD strength, the ongoing Nafta uncertainty and the political uncertainty in Mexico as the campaign picks up is all contributing to the weaker peso,” said Eric Viloria, a currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) who sees the peso heading to 19 per dollar.
To be sure, there are political analysts who think as president Lopez Obrador is likely to be more like Brazil’s former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva -- who fought for programs to help the poor while preserving market-friendly reforms from his predecessor -- and less like Hugo Chavez, who destroyed Venezuela’s economy with his socialist policies.
Before the recent selloff, the currency had gained 9.2 percent this year amid optimism officials would reach a deal on Nafta in the first half of the year even as Lopez Obrador had a steady lead in polls.
But the outlook for Nafta also suffered a fresh blow Monday after a tweet from Donald Trump in which he insisted Mexico needed to reinforce border security and said “we may make this a condition of the new NAFTA Agreement.” Investors are concerned that reaching a deal may get more complicated if negotiations were to drag on into a Lopez Obrador presidency.
Also not helping matters were comments from central bank chief Alejandro Diaz de Leon, who ruled out intervention to support the peso.

1218,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 08:31AM ET</span>",Dollar Bulls Finally Get Lifeboat as 10-Year Yield Grazes 3%,"(Bloomberg) -- Dollar bulls suddenly are breathing more easily, finding succor in benchmark Treasury yields that brushed 3 percent for the first time in four years.
While the psychologically important level has stoked speculation about which markets may be disrupted in the fallout, the U.S. currency looks to be one of the biggest winners. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is headed toward its best three-day advance since 2016, after languishing at multi-year lows. Treasury spreads are widening over their European and Japanese counterparts, renewing traders’ focus on currency pairs.
“The dollar has woken up a bit to rate differentials,” said James Athey, a money manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, who has a long position versus the euro, yen, South Korean won and the offshore yuan. “The flow is all one-way, while the euro is starting to show signs of material fatigue.”
Treasury yields have advanced this year as the widening U.S. budget deficit -- set to surpass $1 trillion by 2020 -- has prompted a wave of fresh supply, while the Federal Reserve is expected to increase interest rates at least another two times this year.
The 10-year yield has not surpassed 3 percent since January 2014. It was at 2.98 percent as of 7:55 a.m. in New York, pulling back from as high as 2.9957 percent earlier.
At the same time, the latest CFTC data suggest that the market is positioned for further weakness in the greenback, something that could prompt a squeeze in short positions. In the options market, sentiment on 10-year Treasury futures turned the most bearish since the February equities correction.
“The key to how the dollar performs going forwards probably depends on how markets react to a break of 3%” in 10-year yields,” wrote Kit Juckes, a global strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA. “A clean break, unaccompanied by a pick-up in volatility and sell-off in risk assets, would force dollar shorts to capitulate and at the very least, severely test EUR/USD 1.2150.”
The euro headed toward that level on Monday, weakening 0.4 percent to $1.2239.
The European Central Bank meets this week, although analyst expectations are low that it will provide fresh clues about when officials will exit quantitative easing or raise the deposit rate for the first time since 2011. Money markets are not pricing the first move higher until the second half of 2019.

1222,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 02:19AM ET</span>",Dollar near two-week high as U.S. bond yields edge up,"By Masayuki Kitano
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar traded near a two-week high against a basket of major currencies on Monday, bolstered by rising U.S. bond yields, while easing concerns over global political risks weighed on the safe haven yen.
The dollar's index against a basket of six major peers edged up 0.1 percent to 90.401 (DXY), staying within sight of a two-week high of 90.477 set on Friday.
Rising U.S. bond yields helped underpin the greenback, with the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield touching a peak of 2.979 percent (US10YT=RR) in Asian trade, the highest since January 2014. 
Concerns that recent rises in global oil prices could add to inflationary pressures, as well as increases in U.S. debt issuance, are likely contributing to the rise in Treasury yields, said Teppei Ino, a Singapore-based analyst for MUFG Bank.
""So this rise in yields is probably not something that should be welcomed,"" Ino said. 
""The market reaction for now is for the dollar to strengthen, but at the same time the dollar index hasn't risen above its recent trading ranges,"" Ino added. 
The dollar index has traded in a range of about 88.25 to 91.00 since around the middle of January. 
The rise in U.S. bond yields pressured emerging Asian currencies, with the Indonesian rupiah  hitting a two-year low of 13,895 per dollar.
YEN EDGES LOWER 
Against the yen, the dollar hit a two-month high of 107.89 yen, and last changed hands at 107.80 yen , up 0.2 percent on the day.
Easing concerns over global political risks weighed on the Japanese currency, market participants said. 
The yen tends to attract demand in times of economic uncertainty and market turmoil, and sell off when confidence returns. 
North Korea said on Saturday it would immediately suspend nuclear and missile tests, scrap its nuclear test site and pursue economic growth and peace instead. It made these comments ahead of planned summits with South Korea and the United States. 
""The dollar momentum...is probably going to carry the way at least until the next negative headline comes out,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore.
Even traders who had been bearish on the dollar seem to be looking for opportunities to take long positions, with the greenback seen underpinned for now by higher U.S. bond yields, Innes added.
Besides concerns over geopolitical risks, worries over U.S.-China trade tensions also appear to be waning, Innes said.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday he may travel to China, a move that could ease tensions between the world's two largest economies.
The euro eased 0.1 percent to $1.2274 (EUR=), having set a two-week low of $1.2250 on Friday. 
The common currency had slipped last week as investors trimmed long positions in the euro ahead of this week's European Central Bank policy meeting at which policymakers are largely expected to signal no change in policy. 
Sterling last changed hands at $1.4016 , up 0.1 percent on the day. Last week, it fell 1.7 percent, its biggest weekly drop since early February.

The pound fell last week on weaker-than-expected inflation and retail sales data and comments from Bank of England (BOE) Governor Mark Carney on Thursday, which traders interpreted as the BOE being less committed to raising rates in May due to recent ""mixed"" data.

The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims fell by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 232,000 for the week ended April 13, missing economists’ forecast for a drop to 230,000.
The Philadelphia Fed said Thursday its manufacturing index rose to a reading of 23.2, a three-month high, from 20.8 in April.
The higher Philly Fed reading pointed to signs of a continued rise in input costs, stoking investor expectations for a faster pace of inflation, underpinning a move higher in bond yields – a dollar positive. The U.S. Treasury 10Y bond yield rose above a key 2.9% level as the bond-yield curve continued to steepen.
Investors’ outlook on inflation was also bolstered by the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book report released Wednesday, suggesting that consumer inflation could be set on a path higher as rising input costs were expected to be passed onto consumers.

1232,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>",Hong Kong central bank confident in currency peg even as interbank rate jumps,"By Donny Kwok
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's central bank said on Thursday it has confidence in the financial hub's more than three-decade old peg to the U.S. dollar, even as it continued to intervene to prop up the currency and as interbank rates jumped to a 10-year high.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said its recent operations in the banking system have been smooth and in line with expectations after intervening in U.S. trade as the Hong Kong dollar repeatedly hit the weak end of its trading band.
""We see that the operation in the market has been smooth and orderly, and the market's confidence in the ability of the HKMA to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar is very strong and also very strong confidence in the Linked Exchange Rate System,"" said Howard Lee, deputy chief executive of the HKMA, referring to the city's currency peg. 
""The amount and the extent of outflows would depend very much on market sentiment and also the market view,"" he added.
Lee said he had not seen huge short-selling of Hong Kong dollars.
The HKMA has now mopped up HK$51.33 billion of Hong Kong dollars from the foreign exchange market since last Thursday in its first intervention since 2015.
The Hong Kong dollar is pegged at 7.8 to the U.S. dollar but can trade between 7.75 and 7.85. Under the currency peg, the HKMA is obliged to intervene when the Hong Kong dollar hits 7.75 or 7.85 to keep the band intact.
The currency traded at 7.8475 against the U.S. dollar at 0343 GMT while a key lending rate that could push up borrowing costs climbed to new highs.
The three-month interbank rate in Hong Kong , which influences mortgage rates, hit its highest since 2008, edging up to 1.33661 percent.
PROPERTY MARKET STRONG
Thomas Shik, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank, said there was no need for concern as the economy was strong and there was ample liquidity in the system, while the property market remains robust. 
""The interest rate is trending up and home buyers will have to assess the risk. Ninety percent of mortgages are now linked to HIBOR and the HIBOR has risen gradually in the past 2-3 years,"" he said. ""However, the property market is still strong with buyers still having confidence in buying a home amid a low unemployment rate and strong economy."" 
As the former British colony pegs its currency to the dollar, its money market rates should mirror those of its U.S. counterpart, but the gap has now widened to more than 133 basis points since the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates from ultra-low levels adopted during the 2008 financial crisis. 
Hong Kong's markets have remained flush with excess cash, keeping a lid on Hong Kong dollar interest rates.
Most market participants do not see this bout of weakness as a threat to the currency peg even though ample liquidity, thanks to inflows from Chinese investors and overseas into Hong Kong's domestic markets, is anchoring short-term interest rates and exerting depreciation pressure on the currency.
Hong Kong authorities have maintained the peg even though that means reconciling sometimes divergent monetary policy-making pressures in the United States with the economic dynamics in mainland China.
The financial hub has more than $400 billion in reserves to defend the Hong Kong dollar. 
Hong Kong has raised its base rate charged through its overnight discount window twice in the past few months in lockstep with the Fed. The base rate now stands at 2.00 percent.
The city's major banks have left their prime rates unchanged, although the HKMA has said it expects them to raise rates gradually.

(Reuters) - Investors trimmed their long positions in most emerging Asian currencies in the last two weeks, a Reuters poll showed, as the dollar bounced back amid improving appetite for riskier assets and upbeat U.S. economic data.
Expectations that Western strikes on Syria last week will not escalate have also supported the greenback.
The dollar index against a group of major currencies (DXY) traded 0.1 percent up at 0245 GMT.
Among the biggest shifts in investor sentiment, bullish bets on the Korean won <KRW=KFTC> and the Malaysian ringgit <MYR=> plummeted to their weakest in nearly eight months.
Sentiment on the Thai baht dipped to levels last seen in October.
""The pruning of long positions in most AXJ currencies appears quite modest considering the simmering global trade and geo-political tensions,"" said Reuters FX analyst Krishna Kumar.
""The position adjustments have scarcely moved these currencies, particularly the yuan, which reflects the underlying bullish sentiment for them.""
Long positions in the Chinese yuan <CNY=CFXS> and the Taiwan dollar <TWD=TP> touched a three-month low and a five-month low, respectively.
China's central bank surprised markets earlier this week by cutting the amount of reserves banks must keep on reserve.
While most analysts categorized the move as more of a liquidity management exercise, not a monetary policy shift, it has stirred some concerns over the health of the economy and future policy direction as a U.S.-China trade row intensifies.
The hefty reserve cut came hours after data showed the world's second-biggest grew at a slightly faster-than-expected pace in the first quarter, but despite an upbeat view, economists still expect China's economic growth to slow this year, a Reuters poll revealed.
Bullish bets on the Singapore dollar <SGD=D3> were also cut slightly, according to the poll of 10 analysts, traders and fund managers.
Bets on the Indian rupee turned bearish again after turning slightly bullish in the last poll, while investors grew even more bearish on the Indonesian rupiah <IDR=> and the Philippine peso <PHP=>.
""The rupee is a justified exception with the jump in bearish bets reflecting its rising string of woes such as deficit concerns, political uncertainty and the rally in oil prices,"" explained Kumar.
The peso has lost over 4 percent so far this year, making it the worst performer in the region, followed by the rupee which has fallen 2.9 percent since the start of 2018.
The poll was conducted between Wednesday and Thursday, with the bulk of the responses coming in by Wednesday.
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long in U.S. dollars.

The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

Market continues to eye the U.S.-Japan meeting that discusses the trade relations between the two countries to look for directional drivers for the greenback and the yen.
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies last stood at 89.36, up 0.01 at 11:00PM ET (03:00 GMT).
The dollar got a lift from the higher 10-year U.S. treasury yields that climbed from 2.82% to 2.87%. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump raised the possibility of rejoining the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal) if Japan proposes a good deal.

The USD/JPY pair gained 0.17% to 107.41. The U.S.-Japan summit was in focus on Thursday, at which U.S President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed to intensify trade consultations between the two longtime allies.
""President Trump and I agreed to start talks for free, fair and reciprocal trade deals,"" Abe said.
Trumps wants a bilateral deal with Japan and said that ""If we can come to an arrangement between the U.S. and Japan we would discuss taking all proposed steel and aluminium tariffs"". Japan, despite being a long-term U.S. ally, currently is not exempted from the tariffs on imported steel and aluminium.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.08% to trade at 0.7790. The Aussie remained bullish despite disappointing job data that the economy added only 4,900 jobs, far under the expected 20,300. Its unemployment rate  remained at 5.5% in March, same as February.
In China, The People's Bank of China set the fix rate of yuan against the dollar at 6.2832 versus the previous day's 6.2817. The USD/CNY pair eased 0.16% to trade at 2642.

1235,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 03:03PM ET</span>","Dollar rises with higher U.S. yields, sterling slumps","By Richard Leong
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar gained against a basket of currencies on Thursday on higher U.S. bond yields and expectations of more rate increases from the Federal Reserve, while sterling fell to a near two-week low on perceived dovish remarks from the head of the Bank of England. 
Recent economic data suggested business activities overseas may have peaked. This has reduced the appeal of the euro, yen, pound and other currencies which have strengthened against the dollar since 2017 based on the view economies outside the United States had been faring better until recent weeks.
The relatively optimistic backdrop in the United States should support the Fed to raise short-term rates at least twice more in 2018, traders and analysts said.
""People are looking at the next potential rate hike whether we get two or three more this year,"" said Minh Trang, senior foreign exchange trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California.
An index that tracks the greenback versus the euro, yen, sterling and three other currencies (DXY) rose 0.28 percent, to 89.877 after touching a one-week peak.
The euro (EUR=) was last down 0.21 percent, at $1.2346, while the dollar  was 0.10 percent higher at 107.34 yen.
The U.S. economy, while not firing on all cylinders, has remained on a steady growth path which has assured the Fed to stick with its current pace of rate increases.
This has propelled the two-year Treasury yield (US2YT=RR) to 2.436 percent, its highest level since September 2008. Its yield gap over two-year German Bunds  has reached its widest level in over three decades. The hefty 3 percentage point yield premium has supported some overseas demand for the dollar, analysts said.
On the other hand, the dollar faces headwinds from the uncertainty stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's trade and economic policies, as well as political events in the Middle East and elsewhere.
""There is a little bit of fatigue with the trade war issue and the global economic cycle is losing momentum, especially in the euro zone whereas the U.S. is holding up,"" said Christin Tuxen, an FX strategist at Danske Bank in Copenhagen.
Investors are growing nervous that the euro zone economy's rebound is nearing the top and the European Central Bank may move more slowly to tighten monetary policy. 
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney on Thursday acknowledged the recent mixed domestic economic readings, which reinforced the view the BOE would raise rates gradual over next few years. His comments knocked the pound to near two-week low against the dollar . 
Sterling was last down 0.85 percent at $1.4085.

The new policy could encourage government bodies and firms linked to the state to increase their use of the euro at the expense of the dollar.
Central bank governor Valiollah Seif said last week that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had welcomed his suggestion of replacing the dollar with the euro in foreign trade, as the ""dollar has no place in our transactions today"".
Tehran has been trying for years to move away from the dollar, although much of the country's international trade is still conducted in dollars and ordinary Iranians use them for travel and savings.
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to exit a 2015 nuclear deal Iran made with world powers unless it is revised. U.S. sanctions will resume unless Trump issues new ""waivers"" to suspend them on May 12.
Bank transactions involving the dollar are already difficult for Iran because legal risks make U.S. banks unwilling to do business with Tehran. Foreign firms can be exposed to sanctions if they do Iranian deals in dollars, even if the operations involve non-U.S. branches. 
As a result, France will start offering euro-denominated credits to Iranian buyers of its goods later this year to keep its trade out of reach of U.S. sanctions, the head of state-owned French investment bank Bpifrance said in February.
The threat of U.S. sanctions has destabilised Iran's foreign exchange market in recent months.
The rial lost close to half its value on the free market between last September and last week, sinking to a record low of about 60,000 against the dollar before authorities set a fixed rate of 42,000 and warned Iranians they would face penalties for using other rates.
Khamenei on Wednesday blamed foreign enemies for the ""recent issues in the currency market"" and asked Iran's intelligence services to defuse the plots against the Islamic Republic.

Police spokesman Saeed Montazer al-Mahdi was also quoted by ISNA saying that 39 currency exchangers have been arrested ""for disrupting the market"" and 80 unlicensed currency exchange shops have been shut down in recent days.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose modestly against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, buttressed by higher U.S. bond yields and the view the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates further on signs of ongoing economic growth.
The dollar also has found support from reduced fears about a U.S. trade war with China and that Western air strikes on Syria would intensify.
The Federal Reserve's latest Beige Book, released on Wednesday, showed the U.S. economy was growing at a modest to moderate pace in March through early April.
Nevertheless, the greenback remains on a bearish path on expectations that the U.S. trade and federal deficits would balloon in the coming quarters, many analysts said.
""We have been in a remarkable stable range since February,"" said Paresh Upadhyaya, director of currency strategy at Amundi Pioneer Investments in Boston. ""There are opposing factors that have kept the dollar in this narrow range.""
The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against a basket of six currencies, gained 0.12 percent, to 89.626. It has moved between 88.253 and 90.932 since mid-February.
U.S. two-year Treasury yield (US2YT=RR) hit 2.431 percent on Wednesday, which was its highest since September 2008, Reuters data showed.
The yield spread on U.S. two-year Treasuries and German two-year Bunds  grew to 300 basis points, the widest in nearly three decades, increasing the appeal of holding dollars versus the euro.

The euro (EUR=) was up 0.03 percent, at $1.2374, while the greenback  was 0.27 percent higher at 107.28 yen.
Among other G10 currencies, the pound was down 0.6 percent at $1.4201  after it was nudged away from a post-Brexit referendum 22-month high of $1.4377 on Tuesday by weaker-than-expected British wage data.
Annual British consumer price inflation slowed to 2.5 percent in March from 2.7 percent posted in February.
Markets were still pricing in a more than even chance the Bank of England will hike interest rates in May, expectations of which have helped sterling advance aggressively this month. 
The Canadian dollar weakened 0.6 percent to C$1.2630 per dollar  after the Bank of Canada, as expected, left key rates unchanged, but the tone in its policy statement was not as hawkish as some traders had expected.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar is on course to strengthen in April for the eighth time in the last 10 years, a sequence strategists link to seasonal vitality in stocks and energy products, rewarding investors who trade on market patterns.
The potential to predict repetitive returns appears to contradict the well-known hypothesis of financial market efficiency. Still, the loonie has climbed 2.7 percent since the start of the month against its U.S. counterpart, making it the top-performing G10 currency.
""It is playing out really well again this year,"" said Amo Sahota, director at Klarity FX in San Francisco. ""We lighten up our (USD) positions in the month of March knowing that in April the Canadian dollar is going to get more expensive.""
Strategists say the tendency for energy prices to rise ahead of the U.S. summer driving season gives the loonie a spring boost.
""I think that dynamic is important,"" said George Davis, chief technical strategist at RBC Capital Markets. ""The broader commodity complex and crude oil have bullish seasonal windows through April.""
The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, has rallied this month to its highest in more than three years. Also bullish for the currency, the discount between Canadian crude and the U.S. benchmark has been cut in half since March to less than $15.
April has also brought cheer to Wall Street, with the S&P 500 climbing in nine of the last 10 Aprils and on track to do so again this year. Historically, the Canadian dollar has correlated very well with the S&P 500 and other indicators of risk appetite, said Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC), North American head of FX strategy at TD Securities. 
Investors' willingness to take risk often signals confidence in the outlook for the global economy, which is important for a trade-dependent country like Canada.
To be sure, recent improvement in the prospects of a deal to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which could be welcomed by the Bank of Canada when it updates its projections on Wednesday for the domestic economy, is not a recurring event. 
The Canadian dollar has also outperformed in April against the Mexican peso, which strategists say is the best proxy for the chances of a NAFTA deal being reached.
A 1.9 percent April gain on average over the past 10 years is the best by far of any month for the loonie.
But the currency has often declined during the following month, and investors may want to keep in mind a stock market adage that warns of a seasonally weaker period on Wall Street.

""The 'Sell in May (and go away)' phenomenon kicks in"" and the correlation between equities and the Canadian dollar starts to work in the opposite direction, McCormick said.

1246,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 02:31PM ET</span>",China currency moves hang in the balance in U.S. trade spat,"By Richard Leong
(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's latest complaint about China devaluing its currency is off base. But the yuan could potentially become a major sticking point in efforts to resolve the trade dispute between the world's two biggest economies.
Currency valuations have long played a role in global trade spats because the goods of countries with weak currencies have a price advantage over those sold from stronger-currency nations. China has weakened the yuan  at times in the past but more recently it has engineered a strengthening. Retaliating against the Trump administration by weakening it any time soon is seen as a long shot.
Any attempt by China to engineer a weakening, or devaluation, of the yuan might only escalate trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, while providing little relief to Chinese exporters facing the onslaught of tariffs that Trump has imposed.
Devaluation is performed by a central bank or through other official channels. This contrasts with depreciation of a currency, where the foreign exchange market sets its value.
Many analysts say China will be loath to let the yuan depreciate or use it as a tool in the trade war, and Chinese President Xi Jinping's somewhat conciliatory speech last Tuesday also blunted speculation about yuan depreciation. Trump's tweet Monday risks inflaming bilateral tensions, however.
Q: Has China been manipulating its currency?
Not directly. Because the yuan is managed in a tight band around a daily reference rate, there is always the suspicion of official bias in its movement. But China allowed its yuan to rise 6.8 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2017. In recent months, it has kept the yuan nearly constant against a broad trade-weighted currency basket. That makes it less volatile than most market-determined currency systems, but China has not been seen intervening to weaken the yuan or overtly prevent its appreciation. 
Q: How might China weaken its currency?
A: Beijing could potentially lower its daily fixing of the yuan against the dollar. The currency moves in a 2 percent band around the daily reference rate. Beijing might also signal to its state-owned and affiliated banks to sell yuan and to buy the dollar and Treasuries.
Alternatively, Beijing could re-introduce the counter-cyclical factor that helped the central bank put a floor under the currency in 2016 and 2017. It could also relax rules on retail and corporate capital outflows. 
But so far this year, the yuan, or renminbi,  has risen 3.2 percent against the dollar following a 6.8 percent increase in 2017, the biggest rise in nine years, according to Reuters data. The yuan has been mostly steady against its trade-weighted index for most of this year. 
Of course, the market could suddenly sell the Chinese currency on concerns about the impact of U.S. tariffs on China's exports or broader economic activity.
Q: Would this change China's holdings of U.S. Treasuries?
A: China is the biggest foreign holder of U.S. government debt at $1.177 trillion at the end of February. To weaken the yuan, the world's second-biggest economy could also use dollars to buy more Treasuries. That, in turn, would actually help the United States, since its borrowing needs are going up after a tax overhaul last year and the two-year federal spending deal in February.
Q: Why is a deliberate weakening of the yuan seen as unlikely?
A devaluation would give Washington an opportunity to label China a currency manipulator and to justify trade sanctions. 
It could also hurt confidence in China's markets and spark potentially destabilizing capital outflows, as happened after a surprise 2 percent devaluation of the yuan in August 2015
Countries in East Asia might follow China's lead and devalue to prevent China from having too much of a competitive advantage, said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at BBH. 
China's government has been focusing on reducing high levels of debt in the economy. If it were to undermine investor confidence in the currency, it would complicate the deleveraging process.
Q: How might United States respond to a deliberate yuan weakening?
Embarking on a move to depreciate the yuan might rekindle the ire of Trump, who has branded the Chinese ""world champions"" of currency manipulation.
The U.S. Treasury Department under Trump has not yet labeled China as a currency manipulator.
Q: Is a weaker yuan an effective trade weapon?
A: While a lower yuan would make Chinese goods cheaper for U.S. consumers and importers in the long run, its trade impact would not felt immediately. A sustained weakening of the yuan could also make it harder for China to attract foreign investment.
Many U.S. importers, particularly smaller ones, have locked in the costs of their goods through longer-term contracts. 
""I don't expect any quick impact,"" said Minh Trang, senior foreign exchange trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California.
The U.S. trade deficit with China contracted in February to $29.26 billion, but it still made up more than half of its overall trade deficit. The overall U.S. trade shortfall widened to $57.6 billion, the biggest monthly gap in 9-1/2 years. 
What about equity markets? 

If the reaction is similar to August 2015, when China unexpectedly devalued the yuan by about 2 percent, shares of companies with exposure to China could see their stocks hit, and there could be a broad-based sell-off.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.21% to 89.33.
The Commerce Department said Tuesday U.S. homebuilding rose 1.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.319 million units in March, beating economists’ estimates for an increase to 1.270 million. 
The report also highlighted a sharp 2.5% rise in building permits to a rate of 1.354 million units. 
Industrial production in March, meanwhile, rose 0.5%, topping economists’ forecast for a 0.3% rise. 
The uptick in housing starts was said to be transitory as much of the rise was on the back of an increase in the construction of multi-family homes – a category which not only contributes less to GDP but also is more volatile than the construction activity of single-family homes. 
Pantheon said single-family homes accounts for more than two thirds of housing construction so “short-term swings in the multi-family numbers can't overwhelm the trend.” Construction activity tracks sales, so a sustained rise in housing starts in the near-term is unlikely, the research firm added. 
Bullish remarks from San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams also helped lift sentiment on the greenback as the Fed official said the U.S. central bank needed to continue on its gradual rate-hike path as inflation was closing in on the Fed’s 2% inflation target.

1251,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 11:31AM ET</span>","Trump Bucks Treasury in Ripping China, Russia as FX Meddlers","(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump accused China and Russia of devaluing their currencies, breaking from his own administration’s view that no major trading partners are currency manipulators.
Trump took to Twitter on Monday to declare that China and Russia are playing what he called a “currency devaluation game” at a time when the U.S. Federal Reserve is raising interest rates. “Not acceptable!,’’ Trump wrote.
His comments contradicted a Treasury Department semi-annual report on Friday that refrained from naming any country a currency manipulator based on specific criteria.
A Treasury Department spokesman referred questions to the White House.
The attack added fuel to the brewing trade dispute between the U.S. and China and drew swift criticism from Russia, which the White House recently imposed sanctions on and clashed with over Syria. The Bloomberg Dollar Index slipped to its lowest level since March 26 following Trump’s tweet, while Treasuries fluctuated.
“The basis for this accusation is incomprehensible, and it only elicits a smile, because both business and the government are interested in a stable national currency,” said Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the financial markets committee of Russia’s lower house of parliament, according to state news service RIA Novosti.
Trump has repeatedly blasted Beijing for failing to reduce its trade surplus and open its markets to American investment. China’s yuan, though, has gained about 10 percent against the dollar over the past 12 months, climbing in March to the strongest level since August 2015.
The ruble has weakened more than 9 percent against the dollar in the past year, with much of the decline following the U.S.’s introduction of sanctions on dozens of Russian tycoons, companies and key allies of President Vladimir Putin. The U.S. said on Monday it will decide in the near future whether to impose additional sanctions against Russia.
Trump’s suggestion that a currency war is on the horizon comes as central bankers and finance ministers from around the world prepare to gather in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund this week.
The Treasury’s foreign currency report on Friday ratcheted up criticism of China’s failure to correct its trade imbalance with America and said the increasingly “non-market direction” of China’s economy presented a risk to global growth. Russia, however, isn’t among the 12-largest trading partners and Switzerland that are assessed in the report. The Treasury said on Friday it was considering expanding the number of economies tracked in the study.
China is evaluating the impact of a gradual yuan depreciation as the country’s leaders weigh their options in the trade spat with the U.S., according to people familiar with the matter. A weaker yuan makes imports from China to the U.S. cheaper, driving up America’s trade deficit. The president has repeatedly complained about the U.S. trade shortfall with China, which reached $337 billion in goods and services last year.
Weak Signal
Trump’s comments on Monday are “another implicit signal of the administration’s desire for a weaker U.S. dollar -- especially against major trading partners,” said Viraj Patel, a London-based currency strategist at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV. “These weak dollar expectations will remain entrenched in currency markets, especially if the administration continues its mercantilist policy focus.”
Earlier this year, seemingly off-the-cuff remarks from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that a weaker dollar in the short term benefited the economy roiled currency markets. In January, Trump speaking during a CNBC interview about the situation, said “I don’t like talking” about the dollar. “Because frankly, nobody should be talking about it.”

The U.S. hasn’t branded any country a manipulator since 1994. The department is required by law to report to Congress twice a year on whether America’s major trading partners are gaming their currencies. The report, which began in 2016 under the Obama administration, is the government’s formal channel to impose the manipulator designation, leading to a year of negotiations for a solution and penalties if the practice continues.
Trump backed down from labeling China a currency manipulator after taking office, and the Asian nation only meets one of the three criteria -- for having a large trade surplus with the U.S. -- which are set out by Treasury to designate currency manipulation.
The administration has said it wants to forge currency pacts in new trade deals, such as a revamped North American Free Trade Agreement, to deter currency manipulation.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro rose above $1.24 to a three-week high on Tuesday after solid Chinese economic data and receding worries about more U.S. strikes in Syria revived risk sentiment, weakening the dollar.
U.S. President Donald Trump's comments about China and Russia trying to devalue their currencies this week also weighed on the greenback, with investors believing that the U.S. administration wants to see a weaker currency.
That supported euro buyers and helped the single currency rally 0.3 percent to $1.2412 (EUR=), its highest since March 28.
A key economic sentiment index published out of Germany later on Tuesday could help the euro hold above $1.24, analysts said, and encourage euro bulls again after a rally in the single currency earlier this year ran out of steam.
The dollar, measured against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.2 percent (DXY). 
That weakness included drops against sterling  and against several Asian currencies including the Korean Won , which were bought on hopes that a U.S.-China trade spat would calm down. 
""There's been a general weakness in the dollar and risk sentiment seems to be reviving somewhat. That is supporting the euro but also sterling and Asian currencies,"" said Alvin Tan, FX Strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
""In the background we have the trade issues but that seems to have died off. We haven't had any tweets from Trump (on trade) for a few days.""

But traders suspect Washington could put pressure on Japan after the U.S. Treasury's semi-annual currency report published on Friday kept Japan on a monitoring list for possible manipulation. 
Trump accused Russia and China on Monday of devaluing their currencies, even though the yuan has been strengthening in recent months, and the rouble's recent dive has been widely blamed on U.S. sanctions.
""How grounded the comment is in fact is much less important than the fact that he said it. It also suggests that President Trump could attempt to 'talk down the dollar' to shrink the US import bill.

China's economy grew 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2018 from a year earlier, official data showed on Tuesday, slightly above expectations and unchanged from the previous quarter.
Aside from that data, the focus on Tuesday and for much of this week will be on U.S. corporate earnings.

In addition, Trump accused China and Russia of devaluing their currencies.
The USD/JPY pair eased 0.07% to 107.05. Embroiled in scandals, Abe was under pressure to resign at the end of June as approval rate fell to a new low. He has been plagued by a cronyism scandal involving land sales over a school for months, when documents were founded tampered to remove references to him and his wife.
In China, The People's Bank of China set the fix rate of yuan against the dollar at 6.2771 versus the previous day's 6.2884. The USD/CNY pair eased 0.22% to trade at 6.2810.
China’s GDP growth figures for the first quarter of 2018 came in at 6.8% year-on-year, in line with market expectation. Its industrial production data were worse than expected though, posting 6.0% compared to the estimated 6.4%.
The AUD/USD pair lost 0.15% to trade at 0.7769. The Aussie was weighed down by the disappointing Chinese industrial data. As Australia’s largest trading partner, China’s industrial activity figures could rock the sentiment-linked Aussie.
The Reserve Bank of Australia maintained its dovish monetary policy to keep interest rate at 1.5% as the Bank’s minutes showed on Tuesday that inflation remained below target."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) stepped into currency markets again in U.S. trading hours, buying HK$5.77 billion ($735 million) in Hong Kong dollars as the currency repeatedly hit the weak end of its trading band.
The latest intervention will reduce the aggregate balance - the sum of balances on clearing accounts maintained by banks with the HKMA - to HK$160.74 billion on April 18, according to Reuters data.
Including the HK$9.357 billion of Hong Kong dollars bought on Monday, the HKMA has now mopped up HK$19.021 billion of Hong Kong dollars from the foreign exchange market since Thursday, after the local dollar hit the weaker end of its trading range at 7.85 per U.S. dollar, nudging up a key lending rate that could push borrowing costs higher.
The moves were the first intervention by the territory's de facto central banks in foreign exchange markets since 2015. 
The Hong Kong dollar  is pegged at 7.8 to the U.S. dollar, but can trade between 7.75 and 7.85. Under the currency peg system, the HKMA is obliged to intervene if trading hits either end of the band.
On Sunday, Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan said there was no need to worry about outflows of the local currency although he warned that people should not expect the low-interest rate environment to last forever.
Hong Kong has raised its base rate charged through its overnight discount window twice in the past few months in lockstep with the Fed. The base rate now stands at 2.00 percent. 
The city's major banks have left their prime rates unchanged, although the HKMA has said it expects them to raise rates gradually. 
As the former British colony pegs its currency to the dollar, its money market rates should mirror those of its U.S. counterpart, but the gap has now widened since the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates from ultra-low levels adopted during the 2008 financial crisis.
Hong Kong's markets have remained flush with excess cash, keeping a lid on local currency interest rates.
Most market participants do not see the current bout of weakness as a threat to the currency peg even though high liquidity stemming from Chinese and overseas investment into Hong Kong's domestic markets is anchoring short-term interest rates and putting downward pressure on the currency.
The currency  traded at 7.8499 against the U.S. dollar at 0014 GMT.

1259,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>","German minister praises Macron's ""courage"" in proposing euro zone reforms","BERLIN (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz on Monday praised Emmanuel Macron's ""courage"" in proposing euro zone reforms, as signs grow of resistance to the French leader's ideas among Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives.
Macron is urging closer euro zone integration and wants the currency bloc to have a finance minister and budget while its rescue fund should be turned into a mechanism that can help member states pre-empt threats of financial instability.
Merkel's conservatives are due to discuss such reforms on Tuesday before Merkel meets Macron later this week.
A draft resolution for German lawmakers drawn up by top conservatives rejects plans floated by the executive European Commission to make use of a specific EU legal provision to beef up the currency zone's bailout system by creating a European Monetary Fund (EMF). 
Scholz represents Merkel's centre-left partners, the Social Democrats (SPD), who were given the finance portfolio in a coalition government that took office last month.
The SPD is less reluctant than Merkel's conservatives to seek closer European integration. In particular, the conservatives are allergic to the idea of pooling risks and debts with other euro zone countries.
In March Macron and Merkel pledged to overcome differences to formulate a roadmap for euro zone reform in time for it to be approved by their European peers in June. 
Speaking at an event in Berlin hosted by the BdB banking association, Scholz said the most important task now was to strengthen Europe and take further steps to help the bloc grow closer together.
""In my view Europe is the most important national issue for Germany,"" he said. Of Macron's reform proposals, he said: ""It's good that he does that with a certain amount of courage.""
At the weekend Scholz said Macron's reform proposals should be addressed before European elections next year, but added that not all of the suggestions were feasible.
Euro zone states are discussing deeper integration of their economies, focusing on creating a banking union and turning the European Stability Mechanism bailout fund into a European Monetary Fund, with more powers to help troubled countries.
Scholz said the euro zone should speed up steps towards the banking union: ""We don't have a lot of time for that.""
He stressed that it was important to complete the banking union in such a way that it adhered to stability requirements.

Scholz also said he would stick to the previous government's policy of ensuring a balanced budget, saying his ministry would come up with budgets that do not include any new debt.

“Tax cuts and a tighter labor market should support household spending going forward and we expect consumption to accelerate over the remainder of the year as a result,"" CIBC said.
A sharp rise in GBP/USD to $1.4329, up 0.63%, to a nearly three-month high, weighed on the greenback as sterling continued to benefit from the European Union and UK's agreement on both divorcing terms and a 21-month post-Brexit transitory period.

Traders are reassessing their options after the harshest U.S. sanctions to data sent the ruble tumbling the most since 2015 last week. While some investors are pointing to rising oil prices as a reason to buy assets of the world’s biggest energy producer, others warn that Russia’s deteriorating relations with the West create too much uncertainty about how far U.S. penalties will go.
“The Russian financial market will remain extremely nervous and volatile - with a short-term focus on the scale and rhetoric of the new U.S. sanctions,” analysts at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA’s Russian unit including Yury Tulinov said in a research note.
UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, speaking Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” said U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will announce new sanctions against Russia Monday that “go directly to any sort of companies that were dealing with equipment” related to Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad and his chemical weapons.
The Russian currency climbed as much as 0.7 percent to 61.637 versus the dollar on Monday after earlier falling as much as 0.9 percent. The yield on local-currency bonds maturing in 10 years was steady at 7.51 percent. Bullish bets on the ruble dropped the most since August last week, according to CFTC data.
Konstantin Vyshkovsky, the head of the finance ministry’s debt department, said in an interview that Russia plans to resume its weekly bond auctions this week after panic selling caused it to cancel last week’s offering for the first time since 2015.
Some of the market panic dissipated late last week when U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he remains opposed to the so-called nuclear option of sanctioning Russian sovereign debt.
“The mood is more optimistic today than last week,” said Denis Korshilov, head of fixed-income, currency and commodities at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). in Moscow. “The market participants think the new U.S. sanctions will be targeting particular companies as opposed to the entire bond market.”

1266,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 04:08AM ET</span>",Dollar struggles as FX markets uneasy about seven-year high short bets,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar held steady within established trading ranges on Monday as investors who have recently bet heavily against the greenback digested the implications of weekend strikes on Syria by United States and its allies.
Despite widening interest rate differentials in its favor and the widest yield gap between two-year U.S. and German debt for nearly three decades, the dollar's performance in recent months has been closely correlated to swings in risk appetite.
A weaker dollar has broadly coincided with a pick up in demand for riskier assets and vice versa and the Syria strikes underlined that trend. 
""The military strikes were well telegraphed and we are seeing a continuation in the broad market theme from last week of a weaker dollar and favorable conditions for risk taking,"" said  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) currency strategist Manuel Oliveri.
Against a broad basket of its rivals (DXY), the dollar was flat at 89.75. It has weakened 0.3 percent so far this month, taking its year-to-date losses to 2.5 percent extending a theme firmly in place since last year.
Despite some jitters in emerging markets last week, notably currencies in Russia and Turkey, broad positioning on the dollar remained at multi-year highs. 
In a wider measure of dollar positioning  that includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian rouble, the U.S. dollar posted a net short position valued at $27.21 billion, its biggest since August 2011.
Other major currencies also remain trapped in trading ranges, with the euro starting the week around $1.23, a level around which it had traded all last week.
The U.S. Treasury semi-annual report didn't jolt the currency markets, with the Trump administration again refraining from naming any major trading partners as currency manipulators as it pursues potential tariffs and negotiations to try to cut a massive trade deficit with China. 
Although the Japanese yen usually draws demand in times of political tension and market turmoil due to its perceived safe-haven status, the dollar's losses against it were small.
""The reaction in currencies has been limited as President Trump had provided advance notice about a possible strike on Syria, giving speculators ample time to brace for the actual event,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior forex strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
""Many speculators are showing less of a response to yen-supportive factors lately, after the Bank of Japan made clear it was not going to normalize policy soon. This goes for domestic factors as well, like falling support ratings for (Japan Prime Minister Shinzo) Abe.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration again refrained from naming any major trading partners as currency manipulators on Friday, but the U.S. Treasury's semi-annual currency report criticized China for the ""non-market direction"" of its economy and warned of global risks.
The report comes as the Trump administration pursues potential tariffs, negotiations and other restrictions to try and cut a massive trade deficit with China.
In the report, the U.S. Treasury said it has added India to a monitoring list for extra scrutiny, while keeping China, Japan, Germany, South Korea and Switzerland on the list started in 2016 by the Obama administration.
The report did not mention President Donald Trump's recent threats to impose billions of dollars worth of tariffs on Chinese goods over Beijing's intellectual property practices, or pending Treasury investment restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States.
It said China's yuan in 2017 on a trade-weighted basis was broadly unchanged against the dollar.
""The increasingly non-market direction of China's economic development poses growing risks to its major trading partners and the long-term global growth outlook,"" the Treasury said.
Treasury called for ""further opening of the Chinese economy to U.S. goods and services, as well as reducing the role of state intervention and allowing a greater role for market forces.""
Axel Merk, president and portfolio manager of Merk Hard Currency Fund in Palo Alto, California, said it was not surprising that Treasury did not name China a currency manipulator, saying that doing so is not the administration's interest.
“What labeling someone a currency manipulator means is handing over control to Congress to study the topic,"" Merk said. ""By not labeling them a currency manipulator, they can continue pushing China through the Executive branch."" 
Treasury said India had increased its foreign exchange purchases over the first three quarters of 2017, with full-year purchases reaching a record $56 billion in 2017, or 2.2 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
""Given that Indian foreign exchange reserves are ample by common metrics, and that India maintains some controls on both inbound and outbound flows of private capital, further reserve accumulation does not appear necessary,"" the Treasury said in its report.
India ran a goods trade surplus of $23 billion in 2017 with the United States, far less than China's $375 billion goods trade surplus.
Treasury said China should advance macroeconomic reforms that support greater household consumption growth and help rebalance the economy away from investment.
Treasury also said it ""places significant importance"" on China adhering to its G20 commitments to refrain from engaging in competitive devaluation of its yuan.
Some China experts have speculated that Beijing could use yuan devaluation as a weapon in a broader trade war with the United States.
SOUTH KOREAN INTERVENTIONS
The currency report also did not provide an update on a currency agreement under negotiation with South Korea that was announced as part of an update to the U.S.-South Korean Free Trade Agreement.
The agreement was aimed at increasing the transparency of Seoul's foreign exchange interventions, and the Treasury said Seoul should ""promptly begin reporting"" such data.
Treasury estimated that South Korea had bought $10 billion worth of foreign exchange reserves from November 2017 to January 2018 but added that Seoul ""should limit currency intervention to only truly exceptional circumstances of disorderly market conditions.""
The Treasury report recommended that South Korea, Japan, Germany and Switzerland all take steps to bolster domestic demand, which would help to reduce current account surpluses and trade surpluses with the United States.
The Treasury said Germany ""has a responsibility"" as the world's fourth largest economy to contribute to more balanced trade flows.

""Allowing an increase in domestic demand against relatively inelastic supply should help push up wages, domestic consumption, relative prices against many other euro area members and demand for imports,"" the Treasury said.

Hausmann denounced as “magical thinking” proposals to adopt the dollar, made by the leading opposition presidential candidate. This would require currency reserves that the country doesn’t have, he said.
“Venezuela’s problem is the spectacular collapse in output,” Hausmann said Friday, in an interview in Cartagena, Colombia. “If you don’t recover output quickly, Venezuela will die because there aren’t the calories, the proteins and the medicines to have 30 million people survive in the country.”
Venezuela’s economic disaster is driving more than a hundred thousand people a month to leave the country, often crossing into Colombia on foot and then seeking to get to Chile, Panama and elsewhere. This exodus is likely to gather pace as the establishment of Venezuelan communities across the region makes it easier for new arrivals, Hausmann said.
The adoption of the dollar would mean the government would have to renounce the so-called “inflation tax”, whereby it finances its deficit by creating more money.
“I want to know how it is that the week or the month after dollarization you are going to pay the wages, the pensions and so on,” Hausmann said. “You can tell me the inflation tax is bad, bad as compared to which alternative?”
Opposition presidential candidate Henri Falcon has proposed the adoption of the dollar, with his economic adviser Francisco Rodriguez arguing that this would avoid “a very damaging prolonged period of hyperinflation”, and that converting the outstanding currency could cost about $3 billion, or about one third of current international reserves.
Hausmann said that Venezuela is unlikely to be able to restructure its bonds without regime change, and that the country won’t attract investment unless it can disconnect oil projects from the “bankrupt” state-controlled oil company PDVSA.
“People might invest in Venezuela, but not with that partner,” he said.

""I reiterate that the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars (HKD) and sell U.S. dollars at 7.85 level to ensure that the HKD exchange rate will not weaken beyond 7.8500,"" Norman Chan, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), said in a statement.
In U.S. trading hours, the HKMA stepped into the currency market and bought HK$3.038 billion ($387.01 million) in Hong Kong dollars on Friday, as the local currency hit the weaker end of its trading range.
Earlier in the session, the central bank bought HK$2.442 billion ($311 million) of Hong Kong dollars. On Thursday, it bought HK$816 million from the currency market.
This was the first time since the current trading band was introduced in 2005 that the weak-side convertibility undertaking (CU) at 7.85 to keep the Hong Kong dollar closely pegged to the U.S. currency had been triggered.
The HKMA said the undertaking was triggered in London trading hours.
The Hong Kong dollar touched the lower end of the central bank's trading band target as the interest rate gap between the greenback and the local currency widened. 
As the former British colony pegs its currency to the dollar, its money market rates should mirror those of its U.S. counterpart, but the gap has now widened to more than 117 basis points since the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates from ultra-low levels adopted during the 2008 financial crisis. Hong Kong's markets have remained flush with excess cash, keeping a lid on Hong Kong dollar interest rates.
PRESSURE ON HK DOLLAR
Most market participants do not see the current bout of weakness as a threat to the currency peg even though high liquidity stemming from Chinese and overseas investment into Hong Kong's domestic markets is anchoring short-term interest rates and putting downward pressure on the currency. 
The Hong Kong dollar is pegged at 7.8 to the U.S. dollar, but can trade between the high and low limits of 7.75 and 7.85. Under the currency peg, the HKMA is obliged to intervene when the Hong Kong dollar hits 7.75 or 7.85 to keep the band intact.
The currency traded at 7.8499 against the U.S. dollar at 1655 GMT. 
""The HKMA is fully capable of maintaining the stability of the HKD and managing large scale capital flows. There is no need to be concerned,"" Chan said.
BofA Merrill Lynch forecasts the Hong Kong dollar will stay around 7.85 per U.S. dollar for the rest of 2018. 
The latest intervention, which brings the total amount of local currency bought to HK$6.296 billion, will reduce the aggregate balance - the forecast sum of balances on clearing accounts maintained by banks with the HKMA - to HK$173.482 billion on April 17, according to Reuters data.
HIBOR CLIMBS
Three-month interbank rates in Hong Kong  climbed 4.1 basis points to 1.21 percent in their biggest daily rise since end-November, putting pressure on local lenders to raise a key measure that influences mortgage rates. 
""Hibor firmed up after the intervention and it's clear that Hibor is trending up in a gradual and steady manner,"" said Alan Yip, FX market analyst at Bank of East Asia. 
BofA Merrill Lynch forecasts three-month Hibor will rise to 1.60 percent by year-end and the HKMA would have to buy HK$80 billion of Hong Kong dollars to push up Hibor meaningfully. 
Hong Kong has raised its base rate charged through its overnight discount window twice in the past few months in lockstep with the Fed. The base rate now stands at 2.00 percent. 
The city's major banks have left their prime rates unchanged, although the HKMA has said it expects them to raise rates gradually. 
Hong Kong's U.S. dollar peg has forced it to keep monetary policy loose in recent years in step with the United States, but rock bottom interest rates have only fueled the city's real estate prices that are already among the highest in the world.
The monetary authority last intervened in the market in 2015, selling Hong Kong dollars as the local currency repeatedly hit the strong end of its trading band.

1275,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 12:32AM ET</span>",Singapore Allows Currency to Gain in Gradual Tightening Move,"(Bloomberg) -- Singapore’s central bank made a measured change to policy, allowing its currency to strengthen in the face of solid economic growth, while also acknowledging mounting risks from a U.S.-China trade war.
The Monetary Authority of Singapore, which uses the exchange rate as its main policy tool, increased the slope of the currency band slightly from zero percent, it said in a statement on its website. That was in line with the forecasts from the majority of economists in a Bloomberg survey.
The central bank is moving away from the easing stance adopted in recent years -- like policy makers from the U.S. to South Korea have done -- as growth in the export-led economy strengthens and inflation continues to pick up slowly. With a trade war brewing between Singapore’s two largest trading partners, the MAS signaled a gradual approach to tightening.
“The MAS sounds pretty cautious, even though they are normalizing the policy,” said Francis Tan, an economist at United Overseas Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “They were still appreciative of the possible risks,” especially on trade and “because of that, in October I think they should still maintain” the stance, he said.
While growth in the export-reliant nation is still seen within the 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent range this year, still largely driven by trade-related industries, “an escalation of the U.S.-China trade dispute remains possible, and if it occurs, will have significant consequences for global trade,” the MAS said.
Gross domestic product grew 4.3 percent in the first quarter from a year ago, in line with the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey, preliminary data from the trade ministry showed on Friday.
The Singapore dollar gained as much as 0.3 percent to 1.3083 against the U.S. dollar on Friday and was at 1.3119 as of 11:45 a.m.
Inflation has picked up recently even though it remains at subdued levels. The MAS said the core measure -- which rose to 1.7 percent in February -- will come in at the upper half of its 1 percent to 2 percent forecast range this year.

The central bank guides the local dollar against a basket of its counterparts and adjusts the pace of its appreciation or depreciation by changing the slope, width and center of a currency band. It doesn’t disclose details on the basket, or the band or the pace of appreciation or depreciation.
Singapore isn’t the first in Asia to tighten in this cycle -- South Korea did so in late 2017, and Malaysia in January -- but most aren’t in a rush to move. The Bank of Thailand voted 6-1 in a March 28 decision for no change in policy with below-target inflation and a surging currency. The Philippines held its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 3 percent on March 22, while India kept its rate unchanged last week.
The MAS “did mention that it’s a measured adjustment to the policy stance, and they do acknowledge the uncertainty in the external environment, given trade tensions,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore, who had predicted the MAS would hold its neutral stance. “That suggests to us that the slope is more gradual than in the past when they have tightened.”

1276,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 15, 2018 09:01PM ET</span>","HKMA Intervenes to Buy Local Currency, First Time Since '05","(Bloomberg) -- The Hong Kong Monetary Authority bought the local currency for the first time since the current trading band was imposed in 2005, after the exchange rate sank to the weak end of its permitted range.
The de facto central bank purchased a total of HK$3.258 billion ($415 million), including HK$816 million it bought earlier Thursday, according to the HKMA’s page on Bloomberg. The Hong Kong dollar dropped to HK$7.85 earlier in the day, at the edge of its HK$7.75-7.85 range against the greenback, and has traded close to or at that level since.
Hong Kong dollar funding costs climb across the curve Friday, after the monetary authority’s currency transaction. The three-month interbank rate of the currency, known as Hibor, surged by the most since Nov. 29.
See here for more on the Hong Kong dollar’s slide.
With record foreign-exchange reserves, the HKMA is in a strong position to defend its city’s currency, and there’s no evidence that the trading band is under sustained speculative attack. The authority’s deputy chief executive Howard Lee said Friday morning that the banking system has ample liquidity and can cope with capital outflows, which are within expectation. He said interest rates are likely to rise incrementally and gradually.
The intervention is still significant because the HKMA’s purchases have the potential to boost borrowing costs by draining liquidity. That would signal the end of an era of ultra-cheap money that made Hong Kong the world’s least affordable market for housing and propelled equities to all-time highs.
“We will see more HKMA intervention in the coming days, because the market’s expectations on the Hong Kong dollar are still quite bearish due to the ample liquidity,” said Zhou Hao, an economist at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) in Singapore. “The intervention won’t likely drive a significant rally in the exchange rate, as the demand for the currency remains weak.”
The Hong Kong dollar has been on a downtrend over the past year as liquidity prevented local rates from catching up with U.S. levels, prompting traders to borrow the currency to buy the greenback. It traded at HK$7.8499 per greenback as of 12:12 p.m. in Hong Kong Friday.
‘Normal’ Operation
The HKMA will defend the peg by buying the local dollar against the U.S. currency, Norman Chan, Chief Executive of the HKMA, said in a statement Thursday. Such operations are “normal” and more may come depending on capital flows, he said.
“The HKMA is fully capable of maintaining the stability of the Hong Kong dollar and managing large scale capital flows,” he said. “There is no need to be concerned.”
The city’s aggregate balance of interbank liquidity -- which will shrink as the currency operations continue -- last stood at about HK$180 billion. It will drop to about HK$176.5 billion on April 16, according to the HKMA’s page.
Ryan Lam, head of research at Shanghai Commercial Bank, said that rates in the city won’t meaningfully increase until the balance falls below HK$50 billion.
‘Remain Flooded’
“Hong Kong will remain flooded with liquidity,” said Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swissquote Bank SA. “There are large capital inflows and the demand for the local dollar is weak due to tightening mortgage policy.”
The last time the HKMA bought Hong Kong dollars was in 2005, shortly before the new band was implemented to curb funds flowing into the Asian financial hub to bet on a stronger Chinese yuan. But inflows continued after the financial crisis, encouraged by the currency peg and steady Chinese and local economic growth. This kept liquidity flush even as the U.S. began tightening monetary policy in 2015, causing Hong Kong’s rate discount to widen sharply.
The move to the weak end of the band has been well anticipated and came without the fireworks associated with speculative attacks on pegged currencies. Trading volume in options remains within normal ranges, and even by Hong Kong dollar standards the currency’s daily moves have been tiny. The Hang Seng Index of stocks rose 0.4 percent Friday.
“We believe the HKMA is well positioned to maintain the peg, aided by a record amount of FX reserves, strong fiscal surplus and comfortable current account surplus,” strategists led by Heng Koon How at United Overseas Bank Ltd. wrote in a note. “As long as the HKMA is able to guide local rates higher in a gradual and controlled manner, there will be minimum disruption to local asset markets.”
The UOB analysts said that the HKMA may issue more Exchange Fund Bills as a way to soak up liquidity on a temporary basis. The authority did that in August and September, announcing EFB sales totaling HK$80 billion. Still, chief executive Chan said in a blog post last month that the HKMA had no immediate plan for extra sales.

1277,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 12:14AM ET</span>",Oil Prices Steady On Syria Tensions And Tighter Supply ,"Investing.com - Oil prices remained steady on Thursday morning in Asia amid ongoing tensions over Syria and shrinking global oil supplies. 
Crude Oil WTI Futures for May delivery were trading at $66.86 a barrel in Asia at 11:10PM ET (03:10 GMT), down 0.31%. Brent Oil Futures for June delivery, traded in London, were down 0.29% at $71.81 per barrel. 
Oil prices soared the day before on the threat of imminent U.S. military action in Syria, reaching their highest levels since late 2014. The gains from Wednesday were held stead on Thursday, hovering near three-year highs. 
Tensions escalated earlier this week after Saudi Arabia said its air defense forces intercepted three ballistic missiles fired at Riyadh and other cities, and after U.S. President Donald Trump declared military action against Syria, taunting Russia for supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after a suspected chemical attack on rebels. The concerns of direct conflict over Syria has also escalated a rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran. 
This has raised concerns about possible oil supply disruptions. Although Syria is not a key oil producer, the wider Middle East is the world’s most important crude exporter and tension in the region tends to put oil markets on edge. 
Healthy demand and the supply restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia also continue to prop up oil prices. OPEC said the global oil inventory surplus is close to evaporating, having shrunk by nine-tenths since the start of 2017 due to the supply cuts and rising demand. 
The pact runs until the end of 2018 but there is growing confidence that the cooperation will be extended. OPEC will meet in June to decide on its next course of action. 
Meanwhile, Shanghai Crude Oil WTI Futures for September delivery were up 0.57% at 426.80 yuan ($67.88) per barrel."
1278,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 11:11PM ET</span>",Forex – Dollar Falls Despite Easing Syria Tension,"Investing.com – The dollar slid in Asia on Friday morning as U.S. trade outlook remained uncertain, despite improving risk appetite amid the easing geopolitical worries over Syria. The market also watched closely China’s trade balance figures that can be directional drivers for risk assets and cues for Sino-U.S. trade relations.
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies last stood at 89.47 at 11:00PM ET (03:00 GMT), down 0.02%. It climbed up to the 89.60 range overnight but slid again in late morning.
Trump tempered down the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East after suggesting a military action at Syria may not be imminent, boosting market sentiment overnight in Asia.
Trump said he considered rejoining the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a pact he withdrew from after he took office. This signals a shift in the Trump administration’s tone from a hawkish one as it has known to be embracing protectionism to vow “America First”.
Trump also said the U.S. is moving towards resolving trade disputes and that China and the U.S. might not levy any new tariffs on each other after all.The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.07% to 107.38. The rebound in market sentiment meant less demand for safe-haven assets such as the yen.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.28% to trade at 0.7777. The Aussie remained bullish ahead of China data. The Reserve Bank of Australia released the Financial Stability Report, in which it noted that the banking system remains \""resilient\"" overall, but China trade balance data and high household debt can pose downside risks.
As Australia’s largest trading partner, China reporting more imports of copper and iron ore, which are Australia’s key exports, could send the sentiment-linked Aussie higher, and vice versa.
In China, The People\'s Bank of China set the fix rate of yuan against the dollar at 6.2898 versus the previous day\'s 6.2834. The USD/CNY pair eased 0.06% to trade at 6.2889.
Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong’s Monetary Authority, intervened to buy the Hong Kong dollar for the first time since 2005, after the USD/HKD pair fell to 7.85, the weak end of its permitted range. The city’s de-facto central bank bought a total of HK$3.258 billion ($415 million), including HK$816 million it purchased on Thursday.
The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) also tightened monetary policy for the first time in six years on Friday, and acknowledged risks from the Sino-U.S. trade tensions.

1279,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 12:02AM ET</span>",Dollar nears 1-1/2 month high versus yen as U.S. yields climb,"By Shinichi Saoshiro
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar neared a 1-1/2-month high against the yen on Friday, as an improvement in investor risk appetite buoyed equities and pushed U.S. yields significantly higher.
The dollar was steady at 107.385 yen  after gaining more than 0.5 percent overnight. A rise above 107.490 yen would take it to its highest since late February. The greenback has gained about 0.3 percent versus the yen this week.
Equities were boosted as Wall Street gained on Thursday in anticipation of strong corporate earnings, and as geopolitical worries eased on U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion that a military strike on Syria may not be imminent. 
The dollar had slipped against the yen, a perceived safe-haven, earlier in the week as U.S.-China trade tensions and the possibility of a U.S.-led missile strike on Syria roiled the broader financial markets.
""Some of the moves driven by risk aversion that lifted the yen are being unwound. But while risks facing the market may have softened, they have not gone away,"" said Shin Kadota, senior strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Tokyo.
For now the U.S. currency was supported by higher Treasury yields, with that of the 10-year (US10YT=RR) surging 5 basis points overnight to its highest since late March.
""The dollar had not shown a strong correlation with U.S. yields recently. But the correlation returned somewhat, with currencies taking notice of such a spike in yields,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""Risk aversion in equities will need to keep receding for the dollar to remain supported. There is no change to the equation of 'Trump risk' dictating market direction.""
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was a shade higher at 89.778 (DXY). It rose 0.2 percent the previous day, ending a four-day losing streak.
The euro was little changed at $1.2328 (EUR=) after losing 0.3 percent the previous day, when it ended a four-day winning run.
The common currency has risen 0.4 percent this week, supported by comments from European Central bank officials that reinforced expectations toward monetary policy normalization.
The Swiss franc, a perceived safe haven currency, was little changed at 0.9534 per dollar  after losing 0.5 percent overnight.
The Australian dollar, sensitive to shifts in risk sentiment, rose 0.3 percent to $0.7777  while the New Zealand dollar was nearly flat at $0.7378 .
The Singapore dollar  rose slightly in response to the city-state central bank's first tightening in six years, before giving up its gains, as the move was well anticipated. The currency was little changed at 1.3122 per dollar. 
The Monetary Authority of Singapore said the economy should remain on a steady expansion path in 2018.
The Hong Kong dollar  was at 7.8499 per dollar, after interventions on Thursday and early on Friday by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) nudged it away from the 7.8500 threshold, the lower end of its trading band.

The currency reached the limit of its trading band due to a steadily widening U.S.-Hong Kong interest rate gap. It was HKMA's first intervention to defend the lower end of the barrier since the trading band was introduced in 2005.

Options transactions reported Thursday to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. were more than 900 percent greater than the five-day average as of 3:30 p.m. New York time, following a similar surge in activity Wednesday. About $2.2 billion of dollar puts outweighed roughly $1.3 billion of calls, suggesting traders are hedging against a sharp recovery in the Russian currency.
The ruble fell as much as 11 percent this week to 65.06 per dollar, the weakest since 2016, as the U.S. said it would impose penalties on dozens of Russian tycoons and companies. One-month implied volatility in the dollar-ruble pair remains near its highest in almost two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“When you see a move like that in spot markets, you tend to see a pickup in volumes in other areas, including options, said Bipan Rai, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce’s North America head of foreign-exchange strategy.”
Risk reversals, a barometer of sentiment and market positioning, are also hovering near two year-highs as traders look to profit from a bounce back in the ruble while remaining cautious about further weakness if geopolitical risks resurface.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.31% to 89.50, bouncing from a low of 89.16. 
USD/JPY rose 0.49% to Y107.31 amid easing geopolitical tensions after President Donald Trump said U.S. military action in Syria may not be imminent, backtracking from his aggressive stance.



Weaker U.S. economic data, however, took some steam out of the dollar rally as jobless claims undershot economists’ forecast. 
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims fell by 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 233,000 for the week ended April 6, missing economists’ forecast for a drop to 231,000.
Some said, however, that it is common for jobless claims to show volatility during the spring and Easter break, adding that the report did little to change the narrative of a tight U.S. labor market. 
“Week-to-week volatility [in jobless claims] is not unusual around the Easter and turn-of-the-quarter period,” Amherst said. “In any case, the four-week average inched up to 230K, so the figures do not yet suggest a breakout of the 220K-to-230K range that has prevailed for most of the year.”

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.30% to 89.49 by 11:52 AM ET (15:52 GMT), pulling further away from Wednesday’s two week lows.
The dollar was supported after Wednesday’s minutes of the Federal Reserve’s March meeting showed that officials believe that the economy will continue to firm and that inflation will rise towards their 2% target in the coming months.
Some investors believed the minutes bolstered the case for a faster pace of monetary tightening by the U.S. central bank.
The minutes also showed that officials remained wary about the impact of the White House administration's trade and fiscal policies.
Meanwhile geopolitical tensions eased on Thursday, which also bolstered the dollar. In his latest tweet, U.S. President Donald Trump said that a military strike on Syria after a suspected chemical weapons attack on civilians could come “very soon, or not soon at all.”
Financial markets had slumped on Wednesday after Trump warned Russia of imminent military action in Syria, declaring that missiles ""will be coming"".
Trump also denied a report that he had planned to fire U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller late last year. Mueller is investigating allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The dollar gained ground against the yen, with USD/JPY rising 0.49% to 107.31. The safe haven yen is often sought out by investors in time of market turmoil and political tensions.
The euro fell with EUR/USD down 0.36% to 1.2323.

Britain is aiming to secure a comprehensive free trade deal with the European Union and wants it to be signed shortly after it leaves the bloc in March 2019, although there is scepticism about how much can be agreed by then.
Britain's parliament will vote on a formal withdrawal treaty later in the year — covering issues such as the divorce bill and citizens' rights - in a potential flashpoint in the Brexit process.
Davis said Members of Parliament would insist on ""a lot of detail"" before signing off on any deal because Britain will have to make a payment of about 39 billion pounds ($55 billion) to the EU to honor its financial obligations to the trade bloc.
""The withdrawal agreement is payments of up to 39 billion pounds, it's a lot of money, and parliament is unlikely to sign off on it unless we can be pretty substantive about what is going to be there in the long run,"" Davis said at a Wall Street Journal event in London.
Opponents of leaving the EU have identified winning enough support in the lower house of parliament, the House of Commons, to block any possible deal the government brings back from Brussels as their best chance of overturning Brexit. 
Britain's vast financial services industry will emerge largely unscathed from Brexit and the sector will suffer far fewer job losses than first feared, Davis said.
""There is not going to be a mass migration, the critical mass is still going to be here,"" he said.

""The reason that the City is the biggest and most successful financial center in the world ... is not just Europe, it's about the mass of skills, the business environment here, it's about the reliability of tax law.""

The Russian ruble is down about 10 percent relative to the U.S. dollar so far this week, despite a rise of about 7 percent in front-month Brent futures. This 17 percentage-point gap would be the petrocurrency’s largest underperformance versus Brent since January 2009.
The imposition of sanctions against Russian firms and oligarchs started a slide for the ruble and associated assets, which U.S. President Donald Trump accentuated on Wednesday morning by tweeting that the country should “get ready” because the U.S. is preparing to fire missiles at Syria.

1288,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 12:19AM ET</span>",Oil Prices Rise Over Threat Of U.S. Military Action In Syria ,"Investing.com - Oil prices rose on Thursday morning in Asia as concerns about supply soared on the threat of imminent U.S. military action in Syria, which sent oil prices to their highest levels since late 2014.
Crude Oil WTI Futures for May delivery were trading at $67.16 a barrel in Asia at 11:20PM ET (03:20 GMT), up 0.51%. Brent Oil Futures for June delivery, traded in London, were up 0.37% at $72.33 per barrel.
U.S. President Donald Trump declared that missiles “will be coming” to Syria, taunting Russia for supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after a suspected chemical attack on rebels. Damascus and Moscow have denied any responsibility.
Trump’s comments raised concerns of direct conflict over Syria, which has also escalated a rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Tensions further intensified as Saudi Arabia said its air defense forces intercepted three ballistic missiles fired at Riyadh and other cities by Yemen’s Houthis.
Although Syria is not a key oil producer, the wider Middle East is the world’s most important crude exporter and tension in the region tends to disrupt oil markets.
Both WTI and Brent traded at the highest levels since 2014 as geopolitical concerns overshadowed a surprise buildup in U.S. crude inventories.
Meanwhile, Shanghai Crude Oil WTI Futures for September delivery were up 2.22% at 427.50 yuan ($68.10) per barrel at 11:20PM ET (03:20 GMT) on Thursday.
Concerns over a prolonged trade dispute between the U.S. and China are easing. Healthy demand and the supply restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia also continue to support oil markets.
However, soaring U.S. crude production, which has increased by a quarter since mid-2016 to 10.46 million barrels per day (bpd), is undermining OPEC’s efforts to tighten the oversupply and prop up prices.
U.S. crude oil production is expected to rise to 11.44 million bpd in 2019, making the U.S. the world’s biggest oil producer, surpassing Russia which currently pumps out around 11 million bpd."
1289,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 11:30PM ET</span>",Forex – Dollar Recovers As U.S. Attack on Syria Not Immediate,"Investing.com – The dollar was weighed down to oscillate around 89.20, this week’s lowest range, in Asia on Thursday morning as U.S. threat of military action in Syria deepened the geopolitical conflicts. Asia’s currency market was dominated by the escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East that may get key world players involved, after the Sino-U.S. trade disputes that could translate into a global trade war.
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies last stood at 89.27 at 11:07PM ET (03:07 GMT), up 0.06%. The dollar tumbled to 89.09 overnight, but gradually recovered on Thursday late morning.
Reports that U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to launch missiles at Syria were in focus overnight in Asia and hampered investors’ risk appetite, sending havens such as U.S. treasuries and the anti-risk yen higher. Later in the day, Trump reportedly did not settle on a plan after meeting with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. The twist in the Syria crisis development improved market sentiment on Thursday morning.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.09% to 106.88. The safe-haven yen picked up overnight due to risk aversion after reports of Trump threatening military action at Syria took centre stage. But as the threat was not imminent, investor risk appetite revived and the greenback gradually recovered.
Elsewhere, the AUD/USD pair shed 0.01% to trade at 0.7754. The sentiment-linked Aussie slipped in late morning on a recovering dollar. In addition, Australia's February home loan data came at -0.2%, better than the expected -0.3%.
In China, The People’s Bank of China set the fix rate of yuan against the dollar at 6.2834 versus the previous day’s 6.2911. The USD/CNY pair gained 0.08% to trade at 6.2762.
Meanwhile, investors still await more developments of the trade spat between the world’s two largest economies for cues.

Though investors were relieved on Tuesday, the Sino-U.S. trade disputes remain and could continue to escalate."
1290,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",Dollar struggles near two-week lows as tensions persist,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar held near a two-week low on Thursday against a basket of currencies as investors remained cautious over possible Western military action against Syria, while the euro was also steady before minutes of the ECB's March meeting.
Hawkish minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve in the previous session did little to lift the dollar, with U.S. Treasury yields soft and European stocks subdued after a weak Asian session.
""The broad theme in the currency market this week has been risk appetite, and today (this) ... is pretty cautious because of the geopolitical risks,"" said Adam Cole, head of G10 currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets in London.
The dollar was flat against the basket at 89.57, just above a two-week low of 89.35 hit on Wednesday. (DXY)
The political tensions shifted some of the market's focus away from a lingering trade standoff between Washington and Beijing, with the dollar inching up 0.1 percent to 106.88 yen  after losing 0.4 percent on Wednesday. The yen often draws demand in times of uncertainty.
The risk overhang has also pressured carry trades, in which investors buy low-yielding currencies - the yen has appreciated more than 5 percent so far this year - to invest in relatively higher-yielding ones.
Bilal Hafeez, an FX strategist at Nomura said the broad economic and risk backdrop has become unstable after 2017 saw booming stock markets, synchronized global growth and benign inflation.
""This year is seeing all these reverse,"" he said.
The euro held steady at $1.2362 (EUR=EBS), stabilizing after gains in recent sessions. The euro has gained 0.7 percent so far this week, as comments from European Central Bank officials reinforced views that the bank is on track to normalize monetary policy.

Minutes from the ECB's March meeting are due at 1130 GMT.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.19% to 89.15. But remained above session lows of 89.04.
The so-called core CPI rose 2.1% year-on-year in March, improving on the 1.8% rise seen in February.
While the gain in the core CPI was the largest since February 2017, some market participants continued to forecast only two rates for the year on expectations that inflation would continue to lag the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. 
""Even though core CPI is now back above 2%, it remains below the average level seen prior to last spring's sharp deceleration,"" CIBC said. ""We would still leave core PCE tracking a little below 2%, so there is no reason to forecast more than two rate hikes this year."" 
The data comes ahead of the Federal Reserve’s March meeting minutes due 2.00 pm ET, which may provide investors with an insight into the Fed’s thinking on monetary policy. 
The upbeat CPI data helped the USD/JPY pare losses to Y106.91, down 0.27%. The currency pair fell to a low Y107.25 on safe-haven buying earlier after President Trump had threatened Russia in a series of tweets Wednesday. 



USD/CAD, meanwhile, continued its downward spiral, falling 0.30% to C$1.2561 as a rally in oil prices continued to support the oil-price sensitive loonie. 
EUR/USD rose 0.22% to $1.2382 as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Wednesday he remained confident inflation would hit the central bank’s 2% target. 
GBP/USD rose 0.19% to $1.4202, following mixed economic data as U.K. manufacturing and construction missed expectations, while the trade deficit narrowed more than expected in February."
1292,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 11:32AM ET</span>",Ruble Slumps to 16-Month Low After Trump Warns of Syria Showdown,"(Bloomberg) -- The rout of the ruble triggered by the most punitive U.S. penalties yet deepened after President Donald Trump warned Russia to “get ready” for American missiles in Syria, where Vladimir Putin is committed to defending government forces.
The pledged strikes over an alleged chemical attack in Syria and the latest round of U.S. sanctions rattled markets in Moscow, sending Russia’s currency to a 16-month low and yields on local debt to the highest level of the year.
“Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria,” Trump said in a tweet Wednesday. “Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and ‘smart!’ You shouldn’t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!”
The penalties Treasury imposed Friday hit billionaire Oleg Deripaska’s metals giant United Co. Rusal the hardest, driving one of the country’s largest employers out of the dollar economy and Russian aluminum out of key exchanges. That left investors guessing who or what may be targeted next and Russia girding for “economic war” even before Trump’s threat.
“The sanctions aren’t just increasing, they’re turning into a tool of real economic war,” Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev told parliament earlier Wednesday. “We will take all measures needed to stabilize the situation.”
‘Substantial’ Impact
The volatility prompted the central bank to halt foreign-currency purchases under a budget rule aimed at insulating the economy from swings in oil, Russia’s main export. The Finance Ministry canceled its weekly bond auction for the first time since the 2015 collapse in crude prices. Auctions will resume when the market stabilizes, the ministry said in a statement late Tuesday.
Ruble Lags Brent by Most Since ’09 as Sanctions Thicker Than Oil
Fueling the uncertainty is a bill proposed in Congress last week that would ban the purchase of Russian government debt, even though Treasury has recommended not pursuing the so-called nuclear option because it would be too damaging to U.S. investors. Foreigners held about 34 percent of Russia’s OFZ ruble bonds before the sell-off, a record share.
Thinking the Unthinkable
“Markets quickly switched to thinking the unthinkable of whether sanctions could be extended to the OFZ market,” said Elina Ribakova, head of EMEA Research at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in London. “We believe at this stage it is unlikely. Syria is the key area of risk,” she said.
The ruble slumped 2.3 percent to 64.5125 per dollar at 5:01 p.m. in Moscow. The yield on 10-year ruble bonds was up five basis points at 7.64 percent. The cost of insuring Russian dollar debt against default jumped 7 basis points to 156, set for the highest since August.

Russian stocks have been the lone bright spot since the Moex Russia Index’s 8.4 percent plunge on Monday. The measure climbed 0.9 percent on Wednesday, paring an earlier jump of as much as 2.7 percent, as the weaker ruble boosted the profit outlook for exporters.
‘Malign’ Putin
Still, the possibility of the U.S. inflicting more financial pain over what Treasury refers to as Putin’s “malign activity” around the world will continue to breed uncertainty, according to Prague-based Wood & Co.
“Investors should approach the Russian market with much more caution and be prepared for a lot of volatility in the next few days and weeks,” Wood analysts led by Ildar Davletshin said in a note.
Adding to investor concerns is the unpredictability of the White House in Washington. Trump is intensifying preparations for a U.S. response to the alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria, where Russian and Iranian forces are fighting insurgents on behalf of President Bashar Al-Assad. Trump earlier suggested that Putin may share responsibility with Assad for an attack Russia says never happened.
The latest sanctions are notably worse than earlier ones over Ukraine because they specifically bar any trading of securities of targeted companies rather than just blocking access to new international funding. The iShares JP Morgan EM Local Government Bond ETF, of which Russia is a major component, suffered its biggest outflow since October on Tuesday.
“All Russian companies could potentially be at risk, and the impact could be quite substantial,” said Stephane Monier, chief investment officer at Bank Lombard Odier & Co Ltd. in Geneva.

1298,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 11:40PM ET</span>",Dollar Subdued Despite Easing Sino-U.S. Trade Tensions,"Investing.com – The dollar remained subdued in Asia on Wednesday morning despite the conciliatory comments from the leaders of the U.S. and China that eased the trade tensions between the two countries. The inflation data from Japan and China were also in focus.
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies last stood at 89.31 at 10:55PM ET (02:55 GMT), down 0.01%. The dollar hit this week’s low at 89.27 overnight.
U.S. President Trump praised his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping’s kind words on tariffs and automobile barriers, as Xi said he supported free trade and dialogue to resolve disputes in his speech at the Boao Forum. Xi also pledged to open China’s banking and auto manufacturing sectors.
Investors also await the U.S. March core consumer price index (CPI) that is due later in the day. Economists expect the CPI, a measure of inflation, to remain unchanged at 0.2%, while core year-on-year CPI is expected show a rise of 2.1% from 1.8% in February.
In China, The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) set the fix rate of yuan against the dollar at 6.2911 versus the previous day’s 6.3071. The USD/CNY pair gained 0.02% to trade at 6.2836.
Xi’s non-confrontational remarks on Tuesday were a relief for the investors. Despite the warming Sino-U.S. trade relations, disputes remained to be resolved as China rejected a U.S. request to stop subsidizing technology-sensitive industries.
The PBOC’s governor Yi Gang said China will not devalue the yuan to deal with the trade disputes with the U.S., in response to reports this week that the country was considering a gradual depreciation of the yuan to offset the loss from any trade deals resulted from the disputes.
On a side note, China released lackluster inflation data on Wednesday morning, with consumer price index in March missing the estimated 2.6% to come in at 2.1% and producer price index slipping from the expected 3.2% to come in at 3.1%.
The USD/JPY pair shed 0.07% to trade at 107.11. Japan’s producer price index for March came in at 2.1%, in line with market expectation.
Elsewhere, the AUD/USD pair slipped 0.13% to trade at 0.7750. The Aussie reacted to the dismal Chinese inflation data. China is Australia’s largest trading partner, and the Chinese data may be a directional driver for the sentiment-linked Aussie."
1299,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 01:31PM ET</span>","Ruble Could Recover in `a Matter of Days,' Says Top Forecaster","(Bloomberg) -- Relief may be just around the corner for the beleaguered Russian ruble, according to the currency’s best forecaster.
“If there’s no further comments from the U.S., it could be a matter of days before the Russian markets start rebounding -- it could be the end of this week or the start of next week,” said Sebastien Barbe, the Paris-based head of emerging-market research and strategy at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) CIB and the most accurate ruble predictor since the second quarter of 2017.
“The market sell-off isn’t backed by fundamentals, it’s driven by the sanctions, which means that at some point, the asset prices will likely stabilize,” Barbe said in a telephone interview.
The ruble sank to its lowest since 2016 and government bonds were pummeled after the U.S. imposed its stiffest sanctions yet against Russian companies and oligarchs. While firms in the country have been laboring under sanctions in one form or another since 2014, the latest penalties are much tougher as they include a ban on publicly-traded Russian companies, such as United Co. Rusal.
Some analysts and traders are comparing this week’s market volatility to jitters last seen in 2014, when the ruble fell to a record low during the height of the Ukraine conflict and an almost 50 percent drop in the price of oil. This time around, however, economic fundamentals and oil trading at around $70 a barrel play in Russia’s favor, according to Barbe.
“There’s a big difference between now and 2014, because at that time the main trigger, the main negative factor, was the collapse of oil prices,” Barbe said. “Now that oil is calm, Russia is out of the recession, Putin was just re-elected, people will look at the asset prices, at the economic fundamentals and some will be tempted to buy amid expectations of stabilization.”
Brave Faces
Russian officials are putting on brave faces, saying the sanctions pose no threat to financial stability and don’t require any response from authorities. The ruble’s floating exchange rate helps the economy adapt to shocks, and the central bank can use interest rates to offset any increase in inflation caused by currency weakness, central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said at a conference in Moscow on Tuesday.
Still, an air of unpredictability about who or what might be the next target is spooking foreign investors. One trend Barbe sees as exacerbating the ruble weakness is a sell-off in Russia’s local debt, known as OFZs, by foreigners, who hold a record-high 34 percent.
The pressure may ease once these investors have had a chance to assess the impact of the latest U.S. moves, Barbe said. “People need some time to figure out what the new sanctions mean,” he said.

1300,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 01:07PM ET</span>",Forex - USD/CAD Slumps as Easing Trade War Fears Fail to Inspire Dollar Rally,"Investing.com – The dollar remained under pressure against a basket of major currencies despite strong producer inflation data as an ongoing rally in the Canadian dollar continued to weigh on the greenback.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.13% to 89.41.
The Labor Department said on Tuesday its producer price index for final demand increased 0.3% last month, beating economists’ forecast for 0.1% growth. In the 12 months through March, the PPI rose 3%.
The PPI data came a day ahead of the consumer price index data, which will likely be scrutinised to assess whether the uptick in input prices spurred consumer inflation.
Bank of Montreal said the PPI data released Tuesday reflected a ""healthy print,” showing price pressures at the producer level. The bank said it would await Wednesday's CPI print to determine if rising input costs were passed onto consumers or “whether the costs were mostly absorbed by producer margins.”
The greenback struggled to hold gains, however, as the Canadian dollar continued its advance amid a strong rise in oil prices and ongoing expectations that a new North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) deal will be announced sooner rather than later despite a setback this week.
Talks to rework NAFTA were reportedly not advanced enough for the United States, Mexico, and Canada to announce a deal in principle at this month's Summit of the Americas in Lima, which gets underway April 13.
USD/CAD fell 0.71% to C$1.2608, below its 200-day moving average of C$1.2631.
Yet, a sharp move higher in USD/JPY to Y107.25 eased downside momentum in the dollar basket as trade-war fears faded amid comments overnight from China’s president Xi Jinping. Xi said that China would lower import tariffs on vehicles, encourage imports and strengthen the protection of intellectual property.
EUR/USD rose 0.18% to $1.2342 but pared some of its intraday gains earlier after the European Central Bank (ECB) reportedly downplayed hawkish comments on monetary policy from ECB policymaker Ewald Nowotny.
""Nowotny's views are his own and don't represent the view of the governing council,” an ECB spokesman reportedly said. 
GBP/USD rose 0.25% to $1.4147, amid an uptick in investor expectations for a Bank of England (BoE) rate hike after Ian McCafferty reportedly said the BoE “shouldn't dally when it comes to tightening policy modestly.”"

The remarks helped soothe investor jitters over the ongoing tit-for-tat tariff dispute which investors had feared might escalate into a full blown trade war between the world’s top two economies.
Meanwhile, U.S. data on Tuesday showed that producer prices rose by more than expected in March, underlining the case for the Federal Reserve to increase borrowing costs.

In an interview with Reuters McCafferty said that wage growth, which has lagged inflation for much of the past decade, could prove to be stronger than many of his colleagues on the monetary policy committee believed.
""We shouldn't dally when it comes to tightening policy modestly,"" McCafferty said.
McCafferty was one of the two policymakers who voted for a rate hike last month.
The BoE raised rates for the first time in nearly a decade in November and in February indicated that rates would need to rise again in the coming months, possibly as soon as May.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar bounced against the yen on Tuesday, with broader risk appetite improving after a speech by Chinese President Xi Jinping promising to cut import tariffs eased concerns about a trade conflict between the world's two largest economies.
Speaking at a Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan province, Xi pledged to open the country's economy further and lower import tariffs on products including cars.
Trade conflict worries ebbed after Xi was seen to have refrained from upping the ante between Washington and Beijing in his first public reaction to the tariff standoff on Tuesday.
Xi also said China's reform and opening up will definitely succeed and that a Cold War mentality, zero-sum thinking, and isolationism would hit walls.
The dollar was up 0.3 percent at 107.130 yen  after going as high as 107.245. The greenback had fallen in the two previous sessions as rhetoric from Chinese and U.S. policymakers had kept markets wary.
The Australian dollar, sensitive to shifts in risk sentiment, was up 0.5 percent at $0.7737 .
""Trade war woes have been either getting bigger or smaller every day for a while now. Today they just happened to get smaller and dollar/yen is rising in a text book manner,"" said Daisuke Karakama, chief market economist at Mizuho Bank.
""But we have to keep in mind that Trump's protectionist, anti-globalization stance won't change overnight. His aim is to win the 2020 elections and the markets are likely to be revisited by volatility soon.""
For now, equity markets in Asia have rallied following Xi's speech, reducing demand for the yen, which is often sought in times of market turmoil and political tensions.
The euro rose to 132.035 yen (EURJPY=), its highest since March 14.
Losses in the Japanese currency were limited from tensions stemming from other perceived risks, notably Syria.
Geopolitical risks are weighing on the dollar against the yen amid concerns that U.S.-Russia relations could worsen over the Syria issue, said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities.
U.S. President Trump on Monday promised quick, forceful action in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria, appearing to suggest a potential military response. Trump has castigated Russia for backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
The euro was steady at $1.2317 (EUR=) after rising about 0.35 percent the previous day, when it touched a six-day high of $1.2331.
The common currency was lifted after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on Monday that the slide in stock markets this year has not materially impacted euro zone financial conditions, suggesting policymakers remain calm about the recent market volatility.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies inched up 0.05 percent to 89.885 (DXY) after shedding 0.3 percent on Monday.

The U.S. dollar jumped in a day from 54,700 rials to 60,000 rials in the open market in Tehran on Monday. A dollar was worth 36,000 rials in mid-September.
After an emergency cabinet meeting, Iran's First Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri was quoted by the state media as saying that from Tuesday the price of the dollar would be 42,000 rials in both markets, and for all business activities.
Iran has long been trying to unify its open market rate, used for most commercial transactions, with the official rate, which is a subsidized rate that is only available to government departments and some importers of priority goods.
Jahangiri said from Tuesday the government would not recognize any rate but the official rate, and ""it would be illegal to trade dollars with an unofficial rate.""
U.S. sanctions lifted under Iran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2015 will resume unless U.S. President Donald Trump waives them again on May 12. Trump has effectively set that as a deadline for European powers to fix what he called ""the terrible flaws"" of the deal.

President Hassan Rouhani warned on Monday that Trump will regret it if he pulls out of the nuclear deal.

1307,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 09, 2018 01:32PM ET</span>",Yuan Devaluation Would Prove Just Speed Bump for China ADRs,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese ADRs would take an immediate hit if the yuan were to depreciate, but the securities would quickly rebound, if history is any guide.
Back in August 2015, the securities sank on China’s surprise move to let its currency weaken by about 2 percent. A year later, with the yuan still weakening, the ADRs had stabilized, and then took off again as the currency strengthened.
The reasoning is mechanical: A Chinese company that sells its goods for yuan trades in the U.S. at, say, a multiple of 4:1. If the currency’s value were to fall by half, investors would expect to pay a multiple of 2:1 to keep the ratio constant.
""The biggest risk for any equity is the impact of a devaluation just as we saw in August of 2015,” said Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer at Krane Fund Advisors. ""The material economic impact to the company is small, but there’s a definite headline risk.""
Even so, any disruption in pricing is likely to be brief, according to Scott Snyder, a money manager at Icon Advisers whose fund outperformed 97 percent of peers this year. He’s overweight Chinese stocks and holds a below-benchmark position in ADRs.
“We don’t expect it to change much the long-term outlook,” said Snyder, who sees a 14 percent upside over fair value in Chinese equities, including ADRs. “Companies end up adjusting to currency fluctuations.”

The administration’s “irreconcilable” goals of cutting trade imbalances while funding a large fiscal stimulus program pose the biggest challenge to the international monetary system since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods agreement in the 1970s, George Saravelos, global co-head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note. The only way to resolve these conflicting objectives is via a weaker dollar, he said.
That’s because the U.S. will probably struggle to attract sufficient foreign capital to fund its twin deficits, and that lack of appetite will likely translate to more currency weakness, he said.
“The Trump administration continues to rely on a modern-day Bretton Woods system that has allowed U.S. consumers to live beyond their means via cheap foreign financing,” Saravelos said. “At the same time, however, Trump appears intent on ending this system to protect U.S. workers. The only way to reconcile this ‘have your cake and eat it’ approach is for the dollar to weaken.”

Attention now turns to China’s Boao Forum - the so-called Asian Davos - where Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a much-anticipated speech on Tuesday, which traders are watching for any reference to the trade dispute with the U.S.
The U.S. and China are the world’s two largest oil consuming nations.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures jumped $1.03, or 1.7%, to $63.08 a barrel by 10:10AM ET (1410GMT). The U.S. benchmark lost about 4.4% last week, its biggest such decline since the week ended Feb. 9.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., gained $1.04, or roughly 1.5%, to $68.15 a barrel. Brent saw a weekly fall of 4.5%, its biggest since the week ended March 2.
Oil prices finished lower on Friday to tally their worst weekly loss in two months as investors fled riskier assets amid fears that deteriorating trade relations between the U.S. and China could deal a blow to global growth.
Sentiment took another hit after  General Electric  (NYSE:GE)'s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday that the number of oil drilling rigs rose by 10 to 808 last week.
That was the highest number since March 2015, underscoring worries about rising U.S. output.
Domestic oil production - driven by shale extraction - rose to an all-time high of 10.46 million bpd last week, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said, staying above Saudi Arabia's output levels and within reach of Russia, the world's biggest crude producer.
Analysts and traders have recently warned that booming U.S. shale oil production could potentially derail OPEC's effort to end a supply glut.
OPEC and other producers, including Russia, agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in November last year to slash global inventories to the five year-average. The arrangement is set to expire at the end of 2018.
In the week ahead, oil traders will await fresh data on U.S. commercial crude inventories on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer and how fast output levels will continue to rise.
Market players will also focus on monthly reports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties and the International Energy Agency on Thursday and Friday to assess global oil supply and demand levels.
Comments from global oil producers for additional signals on whether they plan to extend their current production-cut agreement into next year will also remain on the forefront.

USD/JPY was up 0.17% to 107.10 by 03:14 AM ET (07:14 AM GMT), after ending Friday’s session down 0.42%.
The dollar slumped on Friday as fresh fears over the prospect of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies and the disappointing employment data weighed.
The safe haven yen tends to be sought out by investors during times of political or economic uncertainty.
China said Friday that it was prepared to hit back “forcefully” if U.S. President Donald Trump followed through on a threat to impose $100 billion in additional tariffs on imports.
Worries that protectionist trade policies might result in a full blown trade war have fueled fears over the impact on the global economy and U.S. growth, but investors are hopeful that negotiations will result in a compromise.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, edged up 0.1% to 89.92.
The dollar showed little reaction following reports of a suspected U.S. missile attack on a major Syrian air base. Washington denied it had launched any air strikes against the country.
The euro slipped lower, with EUR/USD down 0.11% to 1.2268, holding above the one-month low of 1.2215 seen ahead of Friday’s U.S. jobs data.
The Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy added the fewest jobs in six months in March, but wage growth picked up slightly, indicating that the labor market is continuing to tighten.
The data did little to alter the outlook for monetary policy. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates last month and projected two more rate hikes this year.
Sterling was almost unchanged against the dollar, with GBP/USD last at 1.4096."

Meanwhile, inflation data from China, Japan and the U.S. will be in focus this week.
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies last stood at 89.87 at 11:00PM ET (03:00 GMT), up 0.07%, testing the 90 level after climbing up from the morning low at 89.83.
The trade tensions between the U.S. and China continued to simmer. After threatening additional tariffs on more Chinese goods last Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump said China “will take down its trade barriers because it is the right thing to do” on Sunday. Beijing said it would not back down in face of the trade war.
In addition, the U.S. will post inflation data this week. The U.S. producer price index, forecast at 0.1%, will be due Tuesday, while the core consumer price index, expected to be 0.2%, will come on Wednesday.
In China, the USD/CNY pair eased 0.10% to trade at 6.2983. The People’s Bank of China set the fix rate of yuan against the dollar at 6.3314, versus previous day’s fix of 6.3027.
With China’s Boao Forum opening on Tuesday, eyes will be on Chinese president Xi Jinping to see how he will address the trade disputes with the U.S. China’s foreign exchange reserves rose $9 billion in March as the softer dollar and rising Sino-U.S. trade tensions bolstered expecetations of the firmer yuan.
Meanwhile, China will publish March inflation data on Wednesday, which is forecast at 2.6% year on year from 2.9% in February.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.02% to 106.96. The U.S. confirmed that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is willing to talk to President Trump about denuclearisation, which implied easing geopolitical tensions in East Asia that improved investors’ risk appetite. Japan will also report its producer price index on Wednesday, which is estimated to be 2.1% year-on-year in March compared to 2.5% in February.
Elsewhere, the AUD/USD pair gained 0.12% to trade at 0.7688. Investors await Wednesday's speech from the Reserve Bank of Australia's Governor Phillip Lowe to look for cues.

1315,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2018 11:50PM ET</span>",Dollar steadies but U.S.-China trade tensions cloud outlook,"By Masayuki Kitano
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar steadied on Monday, having retreated late last week due to concerns over U.S.-China trade tensions and following data that showed the U.S. economy created the fewest jobs in six months in March. 
The dollar index (DXY) against a basket of six major currencies inched up 0.1 percent to 90.189 after a drop of 0.4 percent on Friday. 
The dollar index had set a one-month high of 90.597 ahead of the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report data on Friday but later lost some steam, weighed down by concerns about the U.S.-China trade dispute and the disappointing U.S. jobs data.
China warned on Friday it was fully prepared to respond with a ""fierce counter strike"" of fresh trade measures if the United States follows through on President Donald Trump's threat to slap tariffs on an additional $100 billion of Chinese goods.
Increasingly combative statements from Washington and Beijing have stirred fears of a full-blown trade war that could hurt global economic growth, though investors are holding out hope that negotiations will result in a far less damaging compromise.
Risk aversion appears less intense than it did a few weeks ago, partly due to hopes for negotiations between the United States and China toward a pragmatic solution, said Shinichiro Kadota, senior strategist for  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Tokyo.
""We're no longer in a phase where the dollar keeps falling persistently against the yen,"" Kadota said.
""But at the same time, the (dollar's) upside will likely be heavy, given the concerns over a trade war, as well as range-bound moves in U.S. yields and the end of one-way rises in U.S. equities,"" Kadota added. 
Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.1 percent to 107.00 yen , after shedding 0.4 percent on Friday to pull away from a five-week high of 107.49 yen set on Thursday.
That rise to Thursday's peak marked a gain of 2.8 percent for the dollar against the yen, compared with a 16-month low of 104.56 yen set on March 26.
Markets showed limited reaction after Syrian state TV said there were casualties in what it reported was a suspected U.S. missile attack on a major air base in central Syria. The United States, however, denied it had launched any air strikes against the country.
Although geopolitical risks are a concern, they are being offset by solid global economic growth, said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore.
""If economic conditions start to dim, that's when the market might start reacting excessively to these types of things,"" Okagawa said, referring to geopolitical tensions. 
Equities, however, have some resilience now given that U.S. corporate earnings have been solid recently, he added.
U.S. equities will meet a major test in coming weeks as first-quarter earnings pour in, with expectations that tax cuts will help Corporate America show its biggest quarterly profit growth in seven years.
The euro slipped 0.1 percent to $1.2272 (EUR=), but traded above a one-month low of $1.2215 set before last week's U.S. jobs data.
Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report showed an increase of just 103,000 jobs in March, the smallest gain since last

September. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent, which pushed the annual wage growth rate higher.

1316,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2018 08:31PM ET</span>",Asia FX outlook improves but yuan to lose ground on trade dispute: Reuters poll,"By Shrutee Sarkar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The outlook for emerging Asian currencies has brightened for the coming year as the trade dispute between the U.S. and China has further underscored a weak dollar view, but that uncertainty has also dulled the yuan's allure, a Reuters poll found.
While Asian currencies, which are heavily exposed to global trade, should have taken a hit from the ongoing tit-for-tat trade row and on expectations for faster rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve, most of them have gained this year. (World FX rates in 2018 - http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh))
The latest Reuters poll of nearly 70 foreign exchange strategists polled April 3-6 showed most emerging Asian currencies will appreciate anywhere between 0.5 percent and 3 percent by this time next year against the dollar.
The U.S. currency is down around 2 percent this year and the outlook has dimmed further as the dollar has fallen in recent weeks.
""The prospect for Asian currencies is still very strong based on the weak dollar scenario,"" said Prakash Sakpal, ING Asia economist in Singapore.
""Coming into 2018, exports haven't fared badly. Although we may have a potential risk to the economy from the trade war, that is still not the baseline expectation. The pressure for more subdued war is in place.""
In line with those expectations, a separate Reuters poll on positioning showed bullish bets on most Asian currencies increased over the past two weeks. 
But the latest poll showed the Chinese yuan, which posted its biggest quarterly gain in a decade in the previous quarter and is up about 3 percent against the dollar so far in 2018, was set for a dull year ahead.
The yuan  is now forecast to shrug off some of those gains and fall 0.8 percent to 6.35 per U.S. dollar in a year from around 6.30 on Friday. But the 12-month consensus is stronger than the 6.40 expected in March.
""We expect CNY to slightly depreciate again over the coming quarters against the USD, due to weaker growth prospects for the Chinese economy,"" noted analysts at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
A series of Chinese data over the coming weeks is expected to show the world's second-largest economy, which is still largely export-driven, has slowed slightly partly due to the growing risks from the Sino-U.S. trade row.
Export growth may get worse with an escalating trade dispute. China has vowed to fight back ""at any cost"".
Still, about 45 percent of over 60 strategists who had a 12-month view, forecast the yuan to strengthen, including the most optimistic call for it to rise to a record high of 5.90 in a year.
Expectations for yuan appreciation have been driven by the recent trend of a stronger official guidance rate by the People's Bank of China.
The trade spat has led some to view Beijing as amenable to letting the yuan rise at this stage to mitigate some of the tension.
""Though markets occasionally treat U.S. President Trump on trade as a paper tiger, that is not the case in Beijing as a stronger currency is again proffered as an olive branch to Americans,"" noted Sook Mei Leong, ASEAN head of global markets research at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.
China's central bank also raised the rate on 7-day reverse repurchase agreements by 5 basis points to 2.55 percent last month just after the Fed's rate hike - mostly to avoid risking a resurgence in capital outflows from China.
Improved foreign investment inflows will be a supportive backdrop for other Asian currencies, the poll showed.
The South Korean won  was predicted to gain over 1 percent on improved sentiment following a renegotiated trade deal with the United States. The Singapore dollar  is forecast to gain 2.7 percent.
The Malaysian ringgit  is forecast to appreciate around 2 percent this year despite political developments that made way for general elections sooner-than-expected.
The Indian rupee , which has had a rough year so far falling nearly 2 percent, is seen paring those losses and fetching 64.40 in a year, up 0.8 percent from 64.90 it was trading on Friday.
While those forecasts are largely driven by bets against the dollar, the rupee will also be supported by expectations the Reserve Bank of India is more likely to raise rates rather than cut over the coming year.

Friday’s Chinese trade data will be in the spotlight with traders watching to see if recent strong gains in exports continued in March.
Wednesday’s U.S. inflation data will also be closely watched after the latest employment report showed that pace of jobs growth slowed last month, even as wage growth picked up slightly.
The dollar fell against a basket of the other major currencies on Friday as fresh fears over the prospect of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies weighed and a mixed U.S. jobs report did little to alter the monetary policy outlook.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.33% to 89.82 in late trade.
The dollar slid after China said it was prepared to hit back “forcefully” if U.S. President Donald Trump followed through on a threat to impose $100 billion in additional tariffs on imports.
Worries that protectionist trade policies might result in a full blown trade war have fueled fears over the impact on the global economy and U.S. growth.
The dollar had already come under pressure earlier after the Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy added the fewest jobs in six months in March as poor weather dampened hiring. However wage growth picked up slightly, indicating that the labor market is continuing to tighten.
The employment report left the outlook for monetary policy little changed. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates last month and forecast two more rate hikes this year.
The dollar was lower against the yen, with USD/JPY down 0.42% to 106.93 in late trade. The Japanese yen, typically viewed as a safe-haven currency, tends to be sought out by investors during times of political or economic uncertainty.
The dollar was also lower against the traditional safe haven Swiss franc, with USD/CHF losing 0.49% to trade at 0.9589.
The euro pushed higher against the softer greenback, with EUR/USD rising 0.33% to 1.2281.
Sterling was the strongest gainer among the major currencies, with GBP/USD advancing 0.61% to 1.4087.
The pound has strengthened since Britain last month agreed terms with the European Union for a Brexit transition deal and the Bank of England indicated that interest rates will rise in the coming months.
The pound was also higher against the euro, with EUR/GBP down 0.31% to 0.8714 late Friday.
The UK is to release data on industrial and manufacturing output this week and the European Central Bank is to publish the minutes of its March meeting on Wednesday.
The Fed is also to publish the minutes of its March meeting on Wednesday which will be closely watched for any fresh insights on the pace of U.S. monetary tightening.

1318,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2018 11:10PM ET</span>",China forex reserves rise slightly as U.S. dollar weakness continues,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's foreign exchange reserves rose slightly in March as broad U.S. dollar weakness continued and escalating trade tensions between the world's two largest economies bolstered expectations of a firmer Chinese currency.
Reserves rose $9 billion in March to $3.143 trillion, compared with a drop of $27 billion in February, central bank data showed on Sunday.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected reserves to increase by around $6 billion in March to $3.14 trillion. 
Capital flight was seen as a major risk for China at the start of 2017, but a combination of tighter capital controls and a faltering dollar helped the yuan stage a strong turnaround, bolstering confidence in the economy.
Last year China's reserves rose for the first time since 2014 and its cross-border capital flows went from net outflows to basically stable.
China's foreign exchange regulator said in late March it expected cross-border capital flows to remain basically stable this year.
The Chinese currency rose 0.8 percent versus the U.S. dollar in March and posted its biggest quarterly gain in a decade during the January-March period.
Caitong International attributed the recent yuan strength partly to the newly launched crude oil futures in Shanghai, which the brokerage said triggered demand for the yuan from foreign investors.
In 2017, the yuan rose around 6.8 percent against the greenback, reversing three straight years of depreciation.
The Trump administration slapped hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports last week and then announced 25 percent tariffs on some 1,300 Chinese industrial technology, transport and medical products this week in an attempt to force changes in Beijing's intellectual property practices.
In response, China has slapped extra tariffs of up to 25 percent on 128 U.S. products including frozen pork, as well as on wine and certain fruits and nuts, and said it would soon announce more measures of equal intensity and scale against U.S. goods.
The looming specter of a trade war between the two countries fueled expectations that Beijing may be happy to see a stronger yuan at this stage to defuse tensions with Washington.

The value of China's gold reserves rose to $78.419 billion at the end of March, from $78.064 billion at the end of February.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.29% to 89.86, hovering above session lows of 89.82.
The U.S. economy created 103,000 in March, well below the 326,000 jobs created in February, according to a report released Friday by the U.S. Department of Labor. That missed economists’ forecast for 193,000.
The jobless rate remained unchanged at 4.1%, missing economists’ forecasts for a 0.1% decline to 4%. Average hourly earnings grew 0.3% for February, in-line with expectations.
Despite elevated investor expectations for a second rate hike at the Federal Reserve’s upcoming June meeting, analysts cautioned the prospect of further tightening amid a lack of price pressures.
""The probability of a June rate hike remains elevated at 79% but without a meaningful uptick in price pressures, the FOMC will find it difficult to justify a second 2018 rate increase,"" Stifel said.
The dollar was also weighed by increasing demand for safe-haven currencies after U.S.-China tensions grew as China warned it would retaliate with fresh measures to protect its interests after President Donald Trump threatened to impose an extra $100 billion in tariffs.
USD/JPY fell 0.28% to Y107.10.
Some analysts, however, remained positive on the greenback despite growing U.S.-China tensions on trade.
“We remain focused on the constructive technical backdrop for the dollar and war of words on the global trade front, both of which have us leaning short-term positive on the dollar,” TD Securities said

1321,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 06, 2018 09:34AM ET</span>",Currency Market Calm Seen at Risk as Trade War Concerns Escalate,"(Bloomberg) -- Global currency markets have remained remarkably sanguine even as mounting U.S.-China trade tensions roiled equities. How long can that uneasy calm last is the question strategists are now grappling with.
Even with U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese officials volleying proposals to impose tariffs and counter-tariffs, the J.P. Morgan Global FX Volatility Index is on course for a third weekly decline. But the foreign-exchange market could quickly lose its poise and currency swings could widen should the threats escalate into actual implementation of the tariffs, according to analysts.
“Currency markets have taken on the role of a casual observer, with the initial trade war firing shots taking place on the equity market battlefield,” said Viraj Patel, a strategist at ING Bank NV. The tariff threats turning into reality “would be the catalyst for the trade war market dynamics to spillover into the currency arena. One could expect a sharp adjustment and higher volatility in trade-sensitive currency pairs,” particularly in dollar-yen, he said.
Tit-for-Tat: Timeline of the Escalating U.S.-China Trade Dispute
China said on Friday that it would fight U.S. protectionism “to the end, and at any cost,” after Trump ordered his administration to consider tariffs on an additional $100 billion of Chinese goods. European Central Bank Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said the trade spat picked by the U.S. risks increasing the burden on central banks by dimming global growth prospects.
The yen rallied as much as 0.4 percent in early Asian trading on Friday, given its appeal as a haven currency, as China’s statement fueled risk aversion. The Japanese currency pared gains to hold steady at 107.34 per dollar as of 12:40 p.m. in London. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was set for a second weekly advance.
Wild Card Trump
The U.S. Treasury will likely release its semi-annual currency report in mid-April. While still a low-probability risk, any move in the report to formally label China as a currency manipulator “would be a clear escalation in U.S.-China trade and political tensions and a risk-off trigger” according to ING’s Patel.
While foreign-exchange markets have faced only relatively short-lived episodes of volatility in recent years thanks to the assumption that central banks will defend financial stability, uncertainty about Trump’s policies is posing risks, according to Jeremy Stretch, head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
“Trump is a wild card outside of such dynamics and assumptions,” London-based Stretch said. “While we can assume that all the bluster the aggressive headlines are mere negotiating tactics, we cannot be totally certain that events may spiral out of control prompting a more extreme and protracted vol rally, risk-off move.”
For now Stretch doesn’t see those risks as a central scenario and predicts foreign-exchange volatility to remain contained.

1324,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2018 03:31AM ET</span>",Trade worries likely to end Mexico peso's recent upswing: Reuters poll,"By Bruno Federowski
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Recent strength in the Mexican peso is unlikely to hold in coming months as U.S. President Donald Trump doubles down on his protectionist stance, the latest Reuters survey of currency market strategists showed.
The latest results, taken April 3-5, suggest a change in attitudes among economists and strategists, who last month mostly shrugged off the prospect of a global trade war.
Now, they seem increasingly fearful that Mexico could be caught in the crossfire between the United States and China.
""Trump's stand against China shows that his threats pack a punch, which is not good news for Mexico as the NAFTA talks drag on,"" said Bruno Lavieri, an economist at 4E Consultoria.
The United States and China are embroiled in tit-for-tat tariffs that have rattled global financial markets. On Tuesday, the U.S. targeted tariffs on 1,300 Chinese industrial technology, transport and medical products, prompting swift retaliation from China.
Last month, the U.S. government sharply hiked tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in a thinly-disguised swing against Chinese competition. 
Mexico and Canada were exempted from those U.S. measures, driving a 5 percent rally in the Mexican peso to a seven-month peak. Still, poll respondents were skeptical about the upswing.
The peso is likely to weaken 2.2 percent to 18.5 to the dollar in 12 months, according to the median of 18 estimates.
Thomson Reuters' SmartEstimate, which weighs contributions according to past performance, was even weaker than the median.
In comparison, the previous month's survey, taken just before Trump's top economic adviser Gary Cohn quit, had indicated that the peso would remain flat in a year from now.
Cohn's resignation was widely seen as a sign that free trade skeptics were gaining the upper hand at the White House.
Respondents worried that Trump's tough stand against China could extend to negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which seem increasingly likely to overlap with Mexico's July elections.
Canadian policymakers said this week that Mexico, Canada and the United States hade made good progress on negotiations but still had work to do. 
Only six of the roughly 30 chapters in the talks have been closed and Canadian officials do not see how the three nations can close the remaining chapters in the next two weeks, a source familiar with Canada's negotiating position told Reuters.
Meanwhile, nationalist Andrés Manuel López Obrador continues to lead opinion polls in Mexico, potentially adding to Mexico-U.S. tensions. 
Still, Obrador has hinted he could be more pragmatic than previously suggested, naming U.S.-trained economist Carlos Manuel Urzua as his potential finance minister. Urzua kept Mexico City's public accounts in check while serving as finance minister for the local government between 2000 and 2003.
Mexico's peso would take a bigger hit if Trump kills NAFTA than from an Obrador victory, a Reuters poll showed in January.
In contrast, respondents seem largely unperturbed by Brazil's October presidential elections, poised to be the most wide-open and hard-to-predict in decades.
The Brazilian real is seen slipping 0.30 percent to 3.35 to the dollar in 12 months, compared with a 1.5 percent decline in the previous month's survey.
On Thursday, Brazil's top court rejected former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva plea to avoid prison while he appeals a corruption conviction, in a vote that likely ends his political career.
Leftist Lula is still Brazil's most popular politician, but under Brazilian electoral law a candidate is forbidden from running for elected office for eight years after being found guilty of a crime. 
Lula has criticized President Michel Temer's efforts to curb the growth of public debt, cut social security spending and privatize, which ratings agencies have called critical for Brazil to regain its investment grade status.
Temer has said he is considering running for re-election, but his popularity ranks in the single digits.

1325,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2018 01:30AM ET</span>","Swedish currency to rise against euro, dollar and Norwegian crown: Reuters poll","By Camilla Knudsen and Johan Sennero
OSLO/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's currency is set to rally against the euro and dollar in the next year despite a weak first-quarter performance, and will also gain on the Norwegian crown, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
The two Nordic currencies sharply underperformed in 2017 amid worries that house prices could collapse, despite predictions at the start of last year of Nordic currency strength.
The outlook for 2018 is nevertheless more positive, and the central banks of Norway and Sweden plan to begin a gradual tightening of monetary policy after years of ultra-cheap cash, which may also contribute to currency strength.
While Sweden's Riksbank has so far signaled a rate hike in the first quarter of 2019, it may move this to the last quarter of 2018, SEB's chief foreign exchange strategist Carl Hammer said.
""We expect a high March inflation (figure) and that will be the first trigger for a stronger (Swedish) crown,"" he said, while cautioning the currency's upside potential would be limited as long as the central bank keeps a negative repo rate.
For oil-producer Norway, a partial recovery in the price of crude is expected to spur faster growth, and the central bank now predicts a rate hike by autumn, against an earlier view of a December tightening.
The more hawkish Norwegian stance has strengthened its currency against the Swedish crown by some 8 percent since the start of 2018, although the Reuters poll suggested this gap would be partially reversed in the coming year.
Overall, economists predicted the Swedish crown will gain 10 percent from current levels against the dollar  and 6.5 percent against the euro (EURSEK=) by the same time next year.
The Norwegian crown was meanwhile set to rise by 7.4 percent against the dollar  and 4 percent against the euro (EURNOK=) over the next 12 months.
""The Norwegian crown is unreasonably undervalued, when you consider the outlook for the Norwegian economy and rising interest rates,"" DNB Chief Economist Kjersti Haugland said.
""In the last year we have seen a lot of misery priced into the Norwegian currency, and the level is now weaker than fundamental factors indicate. That is the main reason why we expect a stronger crown,"" Haugland added.

Investors also await the nonfarm payrolls data due later in the day.
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies last stood at 90.03 at 11:00PM ET (03:00 GMT), down 0.10%. It dropped from an overnight high at 90.26 to the 90 level.
Trump ordered trade representative Robert Lighthizer to consider additional tariffs on $100 billion of Chinese imports, escalating the trade conflicts between the world’s two largest economies. The financial markets remain sensitive to the developments of a possible full-blown trade war.
In addition, U.S. nonfarm payrolls are estimated to have grown by 193,000 in March, compared with a 313,000 gain in February. The unemployment rate is also expected to slide 0.1 percentage point to 4.0%.
In China, the USD/CNY pair edged up 0.03% to trade at 6.3072. China’s central bank was closed due to public holiday on Friday.
In response, China’s state media said Friday that Beijing will defend its interests ""against new U.S. actions."" On Wednesday, the country also said it would levy a 25% tariff on about $50 billion of U.S. imports including soybeans, automobiles chemicals and aircraft.
The USD/JPY pair eased 0.16% to 107.25. The pair broke the 107 level and reached 107.46 overnight. The safe-haven yen attracted demand in times of market uncertainty due to U.S. trade actions against China that roiled the global market.
Elsewhere, the AUD/USD pair gained 0.07% to trade at 0.7689. The sentiment-linked Aussie climbed up against a softer dollar.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher on Friday, heading for a second week of gains, as investors cut some bets against the currency before monthly U.S. payrolls data that may signal price pressures are growing in the world's biggest economy.
The escalating trade conflict between the United States and China hasn't affected currency markets - most pairs remain in ranges and a gauge of currency market volatility was near 2018 lows.
In the latest salvo, Beijing warned it would fight back ""at any cost"" if the United States stuck to its protectionist stance, after President Donald Trump threatened to impose an extra $100 billion in tariffs.
""Any escalation in the trade war rhetoric would be more negative for China than the U.S., given the former's relative dependency on trade, but for now, the markets are focused on the payrolls data,"" said Richard Falkenhall, a senior currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
The dollar edged 0.1 percent higher against a basket of currencies (DXY) at 90.54 on Friday. On a weekly basis, it was up more than half a percent and on track for its biggest weekly rise in six weeks.
Mainland China markets were shut for a holiday. The offshore yuan was trading more than 0.4 percent weaker against the dollar 
Monthly U.S. payrolls numbers is the main event, with currency markets focused on the annual increase in U.S. average earnings, especially after a strong reading from the ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday. 
Forecasts are for a 2.7 annual rise in wages in March after a 2.6 percent increase in February. Anything higher would signal rising wage pressures, which may lead markets to bet on more U.S. rate increases than the three now expected.
""The dollar's resilience may be a sign that short-term market positioning is tilted toward being short the dollar and long the yen, said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore.
""My feeling is everybody owns yen and the problem is they need some new story lines ... We've got an over-subscribed trade,"" Innes said, referring to bullish bets on the yen.
Market participants cautioned, though, that the yen could gain further if U.S. stock markets come under pressure on Friday.
U.S. S&P 500 E-mini futures (ESc1) were down as much as 0.8 percent, pointing to a lower start for Wall Street. European stock futures were trading as much as 0.2 to 0.7 percent lower.

The euro held steady at $1.2231 (EUR=EBS), near a one-month low of $1.22185 set on Thursday.

1328,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 08:40PM ET</span>","Sterling forecasts at post-Brexit high on BoE, negotiation hopes: Reuters poll","By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling forecasts are at their highest since Britons voted to leave the European Union, a Reuters poll found, partly as a result of optimism driven by progress in divorce talks and expectations of another interest rate rise next month.
But the main reason behind the move is more related to the outlook for the currency that sterling is quoted against, the U.S. dollar, whose path of least resistance remains down and is under even more pressure over a growing U.S.-China trade spat. 
While an economic recession predicted in the event of a ""Leave"" vote in the June 2016 referendum never materialized, partly because very few expected Britain's main trading partner to do so well, the expected slump in sterling did.
At the start of 2016, when the ""Remain"" camp was expected to win, one pound  would get you about $1.49. On Thursday, it was only worth about $1.40, having rallied approximately four percent this year as political fears weighed on the greenback.
So, for the 10th consecutive monthly Reuters poll, the 12-month forecast was revised up and in the latest survey the outlook was for cable to be at $1.44 this time next year.
In one month, cable is forecast at $1.40 and in six months at $1.42, all stronger than predicted in March, according to the April 3-5 poll of over 50 foreign exchange strategists. Seven contributors had forecasts of $1.50 or higher, the most since before the referendum. 
""On the one hand, the Brexit negotiations should see some breakthrough ... and on the other hand it will depend on what the Bank of England will do in the coming months. We have a positive view on cable,"" said Roberto Mialich, currency strategist at UniCredit.
Bets in favor of sterling rose to a multi-year high last week with the latest level of net long position not seen since July 2014, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.
Sterling's fall in the aftermath of the June 2016 referendum sent inflation soaring above the BoE's two percent target. But in the months after the vote, the central bank cut borrowing costs to a record low 0.25 percent to support growth.
That move was reversed little over a year later and with inflation at 2.7 percent in February, a separate March Reuters poll predicted the BoE would add another 25 basis points when policymakers meet in May. 
Britain is set to leave the European Union on March 29, 2019, severing ties that helped define its national identity, its laws, and its international stature over 46 years of integration with European neighbors.
But a transitional deal was agreed in principle with Brussels last month, effectively keeping Britain inside the EU single market until the end of 2020, calming anxious businesses and buying Prime Minister Theresa May more time to negotiate.
Against the common currency the pound (EURGBP=) will tread a different path. On Thursday a euro was worth around 87.3 pence and in a year it will get you 88.0p, the poll found.

1329,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 08:31PM ET</span>","Trade war or not, weak dollar trades here to stay: Reuters poll","By Rahul Karunakar
(Reuters) - Currency market moves as a result of the trade dispute between the United States and China have more or less run their course and only a flare-up in the conflict will change the outlook significantly, a Reuters poll of strategists suggests.
""While the prospect of a trade war has leapt to the number one risk for global investors following China's swift retaliation to U.S. tariffs, FX markets have taken on the role of a casual observer,"" said Viraj Patel, FX strategist at ING.
""This cold trade conflict will most likely need to heat up in order to spill over into the currency arena.""
Global equities have taken a beating over the past month on fears a wider fallout from the Sino-U.S. trade row could harm the global economy, which was already showing signs of shifting into a lower gear.
While little short-term movement was predicted in the latest Reuters poll of over 60 foreign exchange strategists, taken April 3-5, the dollar was forecast to weaken over the coming year, unchanged from last month's survey.
For now though, financial markets have calmed down as Washington has expressed a willingness to negotiate - after proposed U.S. tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods prompted swift retaliation from Beijing.
That pushed the dollar (DXY) to a two-week high on Thursday.
But the latest poll forecast the greenback to weaken in a year, leaving the euro (EUR=) at $1.28, up 4 percent from around $1.23 on Thursday. Those expectations were similar to predictions made in a March poll.
Strategists have held on to a weak dollar outlook in Reuters polls since the start of last year. The greenback fell 10 percent in 2017 and is down a little over 2 percent so far this year.
""For weak dollar expectations to be credibly broken, either we need the U.S. data screaming out that the economic cycle will be much longer than anyone is currently anticipating, or we need to see the trade deficit narrow significantly,"" said Patel.
""But we do not expect either of that to happen, which means predictions for the dollar to weaken are set in stone for currency markets for a while now.""
Thirty of 55 strategists who answered an extra question said their view on the dollar's performance this year had not changed based on the tit-for-tat trade war.
While 16 respondents said the trade row will weaken the dollar further, the remaining nine said they had changed their view in favor of the U.S. currency.
Net short bets or bets against the dollar were trimmed by currency speculators in the latest week from their highest since August 2011 prior to that, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.
""Relative to the start of 2017 or the end of 2016, the markets are a lot more short on the dollar now and that is something which will offer the dollar some protection on the downside,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategist at Rabobank.
Half the 34 strategists who answered a separate question said the current level of net short dollar positions was just about right. While 10 respondents said they were too high the remaining seven said they were too low.
After nearly a decade of ultra-easy monetary policy, expectations are for major central banks to be moving in the same direction - toward policy tightening.
That will likely push the euro and other major currencies to make further modest gains against the dollar over the coming year. But the strength of the euro, up over 2 percent against the dollar this year, appears to have curbed growth somewhat in recent months. 
A private survey showed signs of a slowdown in the euro zone business activity were widespread, with growth in the bloc's big four economies as well as Ireland all moderating.
Sterling forecasts were at their highest since Britons voted to leave the European Union, in part as progress in divorce talks alongside solid expectations for an interest rate rise next month drove optimism. [GBP/POLL]

Projections for the next three months show the currency generating an annualized return of about 8 percent for investors who buy the peso in a so-called carry trade, according to Lawrence, whose bank is among the most bearish forecasters for the currency. While that’s slightly lower than volatility-adjusted potential returns on Turkey’s lira or India’s rupee, Lawrence says the peso’s liquidity makes it a much more attractive bet.
“When volatility spikes, everyone tends to run for the exits at once,” Lawrence said in an interview from New York. “Having a liquid currency is certainly very beneficial when you need to get out.”
The peso already has been one of the best volatility-adjusted carry bets this year, placing second behind the Malaysian ringgit as investors benefited from both appreciation and Mexico’s 7.5 percent benchmark interest rate, which compares with 1.75 percent in the U.S.
Rabobank predicts the peso will depreciate to 20.5 pesos per dollar in the second quarter and end the year at 19.8, compared with consensus forecasts of 19 in the quarter and 18.6 at year-end. The peso rose for a third day today, gaining 0.02 percent to 18.09 as of 10:24 a.m. in New York.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.41% to 90.15.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims rose 24,000 to a seasonally adjusted 242,000 for the week ended March 30, missing economists’ forecast for a rise to 225,000.
The trade deficit — which measures the gap between what the United States imports and what it exports — widened to $57.60 billion in February from $56.70 billion the prior month. Exports in the month were $204.45 billion, while imports came to $262.04 billion.
RBC said the rise in jobless claims “should not come as a shock"" on the heels of a record low print last week. The bank added that the wider trade deficit, however, should “nudge street GDP estimates a touch lower”.
Also supporting sentiment on the dollar was a fall in investor fears over a U.S.-China trade war after Larry Kudlow, director of the White House National Economic Council, suggested the US was willing to strike a deal with Beijing.
""I think we are going to get a deal over a period of time - yes, I think these barriers will come down on both sides,"" Kudlow told reporters on Thursday.

The yen, often sought in times of market turmoil and political tensions, had rallied as U.S. shares tumbled on Wednesday after China imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.

The reason is that traders are struggling to choose the winners and losers.
Volatility in the $5.1-trillion-a-day foreign-exchange market has barely budged in the past two weeks, shaking off the threat of tit-for-tat tariffs between the world’s two largest economies. The stability contrasts with a jump in the Cboe Volatility Index, a gauge of price fluctuations in U.S. stocks.
For currency investors, the challenge is that measures aimed at the U.S. or China could wind up causing ripple effects across world economies. On Wednesday, for example, China’s retaliation against U.S. levies left the dollar little changed broadly, with gains versus about half of its major counterparts.

ISM nonmanufacturing data for March fell to a reading of 58.8, missing expectations for a reading of 59. The services sector is a critical component of the US economy, accounting for roughly 80% of U.S. private-sector gross domestic product (GDP).
On the labor market front, private payrolls grew by 241,000 in March, according to a report released Wednesday by ADP and Moody's Analytics. That beat economists’ forecast for 208,000 new private sector jobs.
Traders played down any expectations that the solid ADP points to a bullish nonfarm payrolls print - due Friday - noting that ADP has proven to be a poor indictor of nonfarm payrolls historically in the month of March, adding that the trade war angst would likely continue to dictate sentiment.
“The trade war is far more important to risk assets and rates at this stage than is any incremental input confirming the US labor market is at or near full employment,” Bank of Montreal said Wednesday.
Trade war fears, however, have since eased amid growing expectations that both China and the U.S. were open to a negotiation on trade as both sets of recently announced tariffs from the two nations have not yet gone into effect.
China on Wednesday proposed tariffs on a host of U.S. imports including soybeans, planes, cars, beef and chemicals. That came just hours after the U.S. unveiled its list of some 1,300 Chinese industrial, transport and medical goods that could be subject to 25% duties.

Dovish comments from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard on Wednesday, did little to boost the greenback after the Fed policymaker said the US central bank doesn’t have to raise interest further as monetary policy is close to “neutral.”

The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies last stood at 89.76 at 11:15PM ET (03:15 GMT), down 0.10%. It dropped from an overnight high at 89.92 to below the 89.80 level.
Tensions continued after the U.S. proposed imposing 25% tariffs on nearly $50 billion worth of made-in-China products - around 1,300 industrial technology, transport and medical products to be particular.
In response, the Chinese embassy in Washington said in a statement that “the Chinese side will resort to the WTO dispute settlement mechanism and take corresponding measures of equal scale and strength against U.S. products in accordance with Chinese law.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Foreign exchange markets trod water on Wednesday, with investors seemingly unable to make up their minds about any wider fallout from a Sino-U.S. trade dispute, though the safe-haven Japanese yen gained versus the dollar.
Those tensions have overshadowed a bounce in U.S. stock markets and prompted a broader reluctance to take on new positions in risk assets.
In FX markets, the dollar dipped only slightly, as some traders bet President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods and Beijing's response would damage the currency while others remained confident the row could be contained.
""There is a lack of consensus in the markets about how trade wars are going to impact,"" said Jany Foley, FX strategist at Rabobank. ""The FX Markets are treading water.""
The dollar fell 0.2 percent to trade at 106.39 yen, a safe haven currency of choice for many who believe it would benefit most during a trade war.
The greenback gained on the yen the day before as risk appetite improved and Wall Street's main indexes advanced, helping the U.S. currency stabilize after recent declines.
The euro slipped 0.1 percent versus the dollar to $1.2264. Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar was down 0.1 percent at 90.102.
Data on Wednesday could return investors' focus to central bank policy, at least in the euro zone. 
Euro zone inflation numbers due at 0900 GMT are expected to show a small pick-up and could offer some support to a single currency that has been stuck in a trading range for the last two months.
ESCALATIONS
The Korean won fell 0.5 percent against the dollar to 1058.57 won. With the Korean economy so exposed to international trade flows, that suggested some parts of the currency markets were expecting trade disputes to hurt global growth.
The Trump administration on Tuesday raised the stakes in its showdown with China, announcing 25 percent tariffs on some 1,300 industrial technology, transport and medical products to try to force changes in Beijing's intellectual property practices.
China's Ministry of Commerce said it ""will soon take measure of equal intensity and scale against U.S. goods.""
The persistent worries over global trade tensions are likely to weigh on the dollar against the yen, said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore.
""The dollar will probably be weighed down, and a rise towards 108 yen seems unlikely,"" Okagawa said.
At the same time, dollar-selling needs among Japanese players have abated now that Japan's end-March financial year-end is out of the way, and that could limit the dollar's downside risk, said Okagawa, who expects the U.S. currency to trade in a 104 yen to 108 yen range in the near term.
Investors are also focused on U.S. payrolls data and comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday, which should help determine the dollar's direction. 

The Australian dollar rose as much as 0.4 percent to $0.7712, getting a boost after data showed a larger-than-expected rise in Australian retail sales in February.

The rise in the greenback comes amid somewhat dovish comments from Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari, who said it's not clear how tight the labor market is and conceded that he was surprised at the extent that the tax cuts had lifted confidence. Kashkari warned, however, that he's not sure if the legislation will boost investment or long term growth.

SINGAPORE/TOKYO (Reuters) - The yen held firm on Tuesday as escalating U.S.-China trade tensions stirred up fears over the outlook for global growth, sapping investors' risk appetite. 
The dollar was little changed at 105.96 yen, struggling to gain traction after having fallen for three straight trading days, and trading below a two-week high around 107.00 yen set on March 28.
The yen had risen on Monday as U.S. equities tumbled, with the S&P 500 sliding 2.2 percent as investors fled technology shares amid resurgent worries over a trade war.
The sell-off in U.S. equities came after China imposed extra tariffs on U.S. products, escalating a dispute between the world's two biggest economic powers. 
""It's going to be choppy, but...given how fragile equity markets look right now, I think the clear trade is dollar/yen lower,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore.
Investors' risk appetite is unlikely to recover quickly unless there is some easing in the U.S.-China trade tensions, he added.
""I don't think people will be looking to put risk on too quickly until something positive develops on the trade front,"" Innes said.
The Japanese yen, typically viewed as a safe-haven currency, tends to benefit at the dollar's expense during times of international political and financial turbulence. 
The yen had risen in March as worries over the risk of a global trade war roiled financial markets. That had sent the dollar down to a 16-month low of 104.56 yen on March 26. 
Some market participants said the dollar could find support against the yen for now, especially if Japanese importers and institutional investors opt to buy the dollar on dips. 
The trade dispute between China and the United States is seen likely to be a market focus in the near term.
The Trump administration is expected sometime this week to publish a list of Chinese goods that could be subjected to new U.S. tariffs.
China's ambassador to the United States said Beijing will take counter-measures of the ""same proportion"" and scale if Washington imposes more tariffs on Chinese goods from a trade probe, state television reported on Tuesday. Investors are also focused on U.S. data this week, led by the non-farm payrolls report for March due on Friday. 
The reports are expected to determine the path for future Federal Reserve interest rate increases.
While the U.S. economy has shown some strength and allowed the Fed to raise rates, the recent slide in equities markets in the wake of trade woes was seen potentially affecting central bank policy.
""If the decline by the S&P 500 doesn't stop and develops into an outright downtrend, it could affect the pace of the Fed's bid to normalize monetary policy,"" said Makoto Noji, senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo.
The euro inched up 0.05 percent to $1.2309.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar was up 0.35 percent at $0.7688, clinging above a three-month low of $0.7643 set last week.

The Aussie's reaction to the Reserve Bank of Australia keeping its cash rate at a record low 1.5 percent on Tuesday was limited, as the decision was widely expected.

1352,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2018 11:51PM ET</span>","Dollar steady vs. yen, traders wary over global trade tensions","By Masayuki Kitano
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar held steady against the yen on Monday, taking a breather after last week's rally and as it treads cautiously amid lingering concerns over a U.S.-China trade spat. 
The dollar last traded at 106.32 yen, after having risen more than 1.5 percent last week for its biggest weekly gain since September 2017.
The U.S. currency had risen against the yen last week, helped by signs China and the United States were working behind the scenes to avoid a full-blown trade war, and hopes for a diplomatic breakthrough over North Korea's nuclear program.
The resulting uptick in risk appetite weighed on the safe-haven yen, a currency that tends to rise during times of market turmoil and vice versa.
Given the simmering U.S.-China trade tensions, however, some analysts say the dollar's gains against the yen may be limited in the near term.
China has slapped extra tariffs of up to 25 percent on 128 U.S. products including frozen pork, as well as on wine and certain fruits and nuts, in response to U.S. duties on imports of aluminum and steel, China's finance ministry said.
The tariffs, to take effect on Monday, match a list of potential tariffs on up to $3 billion in U.S. goods published by China on March 23.
Markets haven't shown much reaction to China's announcement so far, partly because Beijing had already warned of such measures, said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore.
""However, if Chinese equities were to fall on this factor, we could see a general risk-off move,"" Okagawa said, adding that the performance of stock markets would be key.
Asian equities showed resilience on Monday, starting the new quarter with mild gains after a strong performance by global equities last week. 
Analysts say another focus is the potential for foreign investment by Japanese institutional investors at the start of Japan's new financial year. 
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation's Okagawa said Japanese investors will probably increase their allocation to overseas assets, at least to some extent, which will support the dollar.
""Still, it's probably going too far to say that the dollar will head up towards 110 yen in April because of such fresh buying,"" Okagawa added.
Against a basket of six major peers, the dollar last stood at 89.971, having backed off from a one-week high of 90.178 set last Thursday.
The euro held steady at $1.2321. 
Although expectations of an exit from the ECB's stimulus had boosted the euro since last year, the common currency has been in a holding pattern since hitting a three-year high of $1.2556 on Feb. 16, with its March 1 low of $1.21545 seen as an immediate support level.
Elsewhere, some emerging Asian currencies edged higher, with the Malaysian ringgit rising to as high as 3.8550 per U.S. dollar, reaching its firmest since April 2016.
Recent declines in U.S. long-term bond yields seem to be providing support to emerging Asian currencies, even though there are lingering risks such as those related to U.S. trade issues, said Teppei Ino, an analyst for MUFG Bank in Singapore.
""Asian currencies are unlikely to see a slump unless there is a full-blown, one-way move toward risk aversion,"" Ino said.

The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield last stood at 2.764 percent, after having set a seven-week low of 2.739 percent on Thursday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held steady against its peers on Friday as the recovery seen earlier this week petered out ahead of the new quarter, which could potentially bring renewed pressure on the greenback.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was little changed at 90.089.
The index was up nearly 0.8 percent for the week, during which it touched a one-week high of 90.178 on factors including easing of concerns about global trade and perceived progress on North Korea issues.
""A key part of the dollar's recent gains were quarter-end flows, with many investors seen to have closed out short positions on the currency to lift the dollar,"" said Shin Kadota, senior strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Tokyo.
""It remains to be seen if the dollar can retain its gains next week when the new quarter begins, as it will no longer have support from such flows. Much of the challenging themes will remain the same in the next quarter, such as the health of the U.S. economy and trade issues.""
The dollar index was down more than 2 percent for the quarter, its fifth straight quarter of declines.
The greenback, which plumbed a 16-month low of 104.560 on Monday when trade woes roiled the global markets, was flat at 106.440 yen . It has risen 1.6 percent this week and declined 5.5 percent for the quarter.
The euro was little changed at $1.2301 (EUR=), having slipped 0.4 percent this week. The common currency was up 2.5 percent for the quarter.
The pound was steady at $1.4021  and in reach of $1.4011, a one-week low set the previous day.
Sterling has gained 3.8 percent this quarter, its best performance mid-2015, lifted by hopes for a transition Brexit deal - which was eventually agreed earlier this month - and growing expectations that the Bank of England could soon raise interest rates.
The Australian dollar was up 0.1 percent at $0.7686 , edging away from a three-month low of $0.7648 touched on Thursday, pressured by the U.S. dollar's broad bounce and weaker prices of commodities such as iron ore.
The Aussie was down 1.7 percent for the quarter.

The dollar ticked lower after data showing that U.S. consumer spending rose only modestly in February and another report showing that jobless claims fell to a 45-year low last week.

Another report showed that U.S. jobless claims fell to 215,000 last week, a more-than 45 year low.
The data did little to alter expectations that the Federal Reserve will stick to its plan for gradual interest rate hikes this year. The Fed hiked rates for the first time this year last week and stuck to its projection for three rate hikes this year.

The U.S. currency received an additional boost after China said on Wednesday that North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un had pledged his commitment to denuclearization while U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that Kim looked forward to meeting with him.

1361,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 06:31PM ET</span>",Ontario to run deficits for six years as pre-election spending rises,"By Fergal Smith
TORONTO (Reuters) - Ontario said on Wednesday it would boost spending on health care and child care in a pre-election budget that sees the Canadian province make a swift return to running deficits and project a slow path back to balance.
The Liberal Party government of Canada's most populous province said it would run a C$6.7 billion ($5.2 billion) deficit in the fiscal year 2018-19.
It forecasts further deficits of C$6.6 billion and C$6.5 billion respectively in the two subsequent years and a return to balance in 2024-25.
The projections include a C$700 million reserve each year, meaning the province could run smaller deficits if not used.
""It's a slow path to balance,"" said Michael Dolega, senior economist at TD Bank. ""The continuation of deficits restricts the government's ability to support the economy should a downturn occur.""
The province, which is home to manufacturers and automakers, expects growth to slow to 2.2 percent in 2018 and faces significant uncertainties, including the cooling of a previously red-hot housing market, and renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
The return to deficit is an about-face for Premier Kathleen Wynne and the Ontario Liberals, who control a majority in the government and had touted the importance of balancing the books in last year's budget.
The government estimates a modest surplus in 2017-18, the first in a decade, and had projected in November further balanced budgets in the two coming fiscal years. 
The budget includes free preschool child care, free prescription drugs for seniors and a new drug and dental program for people without extended health plans
Free child care for preschoolers, which begins in September 2020, will save families an average C$17,000 per child, the province said. 
The Liberals, who have been in power for more than 14 years, trail the Progressive Conservative Party in polls ahead of the election on June 7.
The Progressive Conservatives lead despite turmoil after the abrupt resignation of the party's former leader. The party is now led by Doug Ford, a former Toronto city councillor and brother of the late Rob Ford, a former Toronto mayor who gained global notoriety for admitting to smoking crack cocaine while in office.

Ontario, which has one of the largest sub-sovereign debts in the world, projects its net debt-to-GDP will rise to 37.6 percent in 2018-19 and will not peak until 2021-22 at 38.9 percent.

CIBC said the better-than-expected growth data was driven by an upward adjustment to consumer spending to 4.0% from 3.8% and a smaller drag from inventories.
Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S., meanwhile, rose for the first time in three months in February, but tight supply is expected to continue to weigh on upward momentum in the months ahead.

Bearish bets on South Africa’s currency versus the dollar are at the lowest level since before the 2008 financial crisis, even with the South African Reserve Bank poised to loosen policy while the Federal Reserve tightens, narrowing the rand’s yield advantage over the greenback.
A glance at the following chart shows why. Having escaped a downgrade from Moody’s Investors Service last week, South Africa offers the highest yield among investment-rated emerging-market countries. And yields could go much lower before that pickup disappears.
That would help insulate South Africa from capital outflows as the policy paths of the SARB and Fed diverge, according to Standard Bank Group Ltd. Inflows into South African bonds have reached 16.5 billion rand ($1.4 billion) this year, more than double the 7.2 billion rand in the same period last year, according to Johannesburg Stock Exchange data.
“As long as our inflation premium is sufficient in a disinflationary environment and the South African Reserve Bank anchors rates, we should be able to withstand any foreign selling of bonds,” said Zaakirah Ismail, a Johannesburg-based fixed-income analyst at Standard Bank.
South Africa’s consumer inflation rate slowed to 4 percent in February, from 4.4 percent the month before, and has been within the central bank’s 3 percent to 6 percent target range since April last year. Policy makers will cut the benchmark repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.5 percent on Wednesday, according to 12 out of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
After securing its investment grade rating from Moody’s, which lifted its outlook to stable from negative, the threat of an exit from  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).’s World Government Bond Index has also receded, giving investors who track the index confidence to hold the debt."

1374,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 09:24PM ET</span>",Dollar holds firm vs yen on hopes of detente in East Asia,"By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held firm against the yen on Thursday, having made its biggest daily gain in more than a half year, helped in part by hopes of detente in East Asia.
The dollar changed hands at 106.82 yen , extending its rebound from Monday's 16-1/2-month low of 104.56. On Wednesday it gained 1.43 percent, the biggest rise since Sept 11.
China said on Wednesday North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un pledged his commitment to denuclearization while U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that Kim looked forward to meeting with him.
Japan's Asahi newspaper reported on Thursday that Tokyo has sounded out the North Korean government about a bilateral summit, just days after Kim met Chinese President Xi Jinping.
All of this has prompted some speculation among traders that a diplomatic breakthrough over North Korea's nuclear program might be closer at hand than at anytime before, even though the hurdles to a solution remain stiff.
Because of Japan's status as a net creditor nation, the yen tends to be bought on rising geopolitical tensions and vice versa.
Some traders also noted, however, that currency trading so far this week has been driven by flows related to quarter-end, and for many Japanese firms, the financial year end, on March 31.
""There are a lot of noises this week. We feel quarter-end, and financial-year end flows are somehow larger this year than usual,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo Branch Manager of State Street.
Traders say the dollar/yen's fall earlier this week could reflect Japanese exporters' dollar-selling before the financial year-end.
On the other hand, Wednesday's gains could stem from buying by Japanese investors for the new financial year as the currency deals will be settled next Monday, after the start of the new financial year.
The euro (EUR=) traded at $1.2310, having lost 0.75 percent on Wednesday and slipping further from Tuesday's high of $1.24765.
The euro was undermined by soft euro zone economic data and comments from some European Central Bank officials suggesting the ECB is in no hurry to wind back its stimulus given the specter of low inflation.
Although expectations of an exit from the ECB's stimulus had boosted the euro since last year, the common currency has been in a holding pattern since hitting a three-year high of $1.2556 on Feb. 16, with its March 1 low of $1.21545 seen as an immediate support level.
So for traders there is probably a lot running on German consumer price data for March, due at 1200 GMT. 
That will be followed by U.S. consumption and price data, which will be closely watched for the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening outlook.
In the U.S. too, expectations of faster pace of tightening have been receding after the Fed last week stuck to its projection that three rate hikes are most likely this year, including the one it made in March.

Elsewhere, the Australian dollar  hit a three-month low of $0.76515. The currency, often used as a proxy on bets on the Chinese economy, has been dogged by concerns over a trade war between the United States and China.

Attorneys for former traders Richard Usher, Chris Ashton and Rohan Ramchandani on Monday said the banks that employed them weren’t always buyers or sellers in the foreign-exchange spot market but were often counterparties making deals, like automakers who sell excess inventory to each other.
""This is just banks contacting each other,"" said Michael Kendall, an attorney for Usher, a former JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). trader. The charges against the three men are the culmination of a global investigation started in 2013 into currency-market manipulation that saw seven banks pay about $10 billion in fines. The trio became a focus of the probes over an electronic chat room, known as “the Cartel,” where they shared information. Their trial is scheduled to start Oct. 1.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Carrie Ann Syme said the traders’ behavior was a ""classic case"" of rivals conspiring to fix a market rather than face competition. Syme said that while competitors deal with each other in every market, the relevant question is whether such deals count as a restraint of trade between parties that transact in a single market.

1378,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 05:31AM ET</span>","As Trade War Heats Up, Biggest Currency Whales Make Their Move","(Bloomberg) -- For the first time in a decade, the world’s central banks are looking beyond the dollar to build their currency reserves.
With U.S. protectionism on the rise, a number of Wall Street strategists say the case for the euro has rarely been better. Existential crises that hobbled the European experiment have receded. A resurgent economy has spurred talk the region’s central bank will curb policies that drove euro yields below zero. And as President Donald Trump threatens a trade war with China, the European Union is pursuing free-trade deals all across Asia and Latin America.
Of course, the dollar commands the lion’s share of the world’s $11.3 trillion of international reserves and most expect it to remain that way. But even a small shift -- whether as a hedge against Trump’s trade policies or in the name of diversification -- could have big consequences. After shunning the common currency for years because of negative interest rates and the region’s persistent turmoil, reserve managers at some of the biggest central banks are now looking to add more euros, according to two heads of foreign-exchange strategy who’ve held regular discussions with them.
“A lot of countries around the world are turning to Europe for increased partnership in trade,’’ said Jens Nordvig, who was Wall Street’s top-ranked currency strategist for five years running before setting up Exante Data a little over a year ago. “It’s not crazy to think that’s also going to be happening in the area of capital markets and reserve allocations. The bottom line is, this trade stance the U.S. has now is not helpful in terms of making the dollar attractive” for central banks that hold billions in reserves.
Nordvig estimates a half-trillion dollars could flow into the euro in the next two years, equal to a 25 percent boost in the currency’s share of reserves.
Developing countries and oil-exporting nations in the Middle East, which rely heavily on international trade, are the most likely to lift their euro allocations, he said. Six emerging economies -- China, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, India, South Korea and Brazil -- hold almost half the world’s reserves, data compiled by Bloomberg show. China alone has amassed over $3 trillion in foreign exchange -- primarily as a result of its cheap exports to the U.S.
The ramifications of such a shift are significant. For over a half century, the dollar has been the reserve currency of choice for most of the world’s central banks because of its depth and stability in global markets. That status has given the U.S. some notable advantages. It has helped America keep a lid on funding costs, allowing it to run budget deficits, as trading partners park their dollars in U.S. government bonds.
The benefits also extend to American companies because the widespread use of dollars in global trade, such as for oil and commodities, often makes it cheaper for U.S. multinationals to borrow vis-a-vis many of their overseas competitors.
Currently, about 64 percent of the global reserves are denominated in dollars. The euro, the only other primary reserve currency, has remained a distant second, accounting for 20 percent of official allocated reserves, or $1.93 trillion. (The remainder comprises a mix of other national currencies like the British pound, Japanese yen and Canadian dollar.)
There’s been plenty of talk over the years about the need to loosen the dollar’s hegemony over the global economy, and the euro’s introduction in 1999 preceded a decade-long decline in dollar reserves. But for much of the past decade, there was little reason to think the euro would be the answer.
After the euro’s share peaked at almost 28 percent in 2009, a succession of humbling setbacks, from the European debt crisis, to Greece’s meltdown and the U.K.’s decision to leave the EU, has eroded confidence in the currency. Start-stop growth and repeated bouts of deflation didn’t help either.
As the European Central Bank enacted emergency measures that drove euro-area sovereign bond yields below zero, reserve managers who typically seek steady income had little incentive to hold euros. From 2010 to 2016, the euro lost roughly 30 percent of its value against the dollar.
Now, two big reasons suggest the euro is about to have its moment.
The one everyone wants to talk about is the economy and how it’s back from the brink. Last year, the euro area expanded 2.3 percent. While that might not sound like much, it was the most in a decade and almost four times the average over that span. The brightening outlook has spurred speculation the ECB will pare back its stimulus. And politically, the union is more sound than it’s been in years, especially after the French election of Emmanuel Macron in May beat back a rising tide of anti-EU sentiment.
Trump Factor
But just as important, perhaps, is the Trump factor. While Wall Street strategists were loath to point fingers at the Trump administration’s “America First” trade policies, there’s little doubt that over the long term, U.S. protectionism could undermine the dollar’s global standing.
In early March, Trump tweeted that “trade wars are good, and easy to win” and made good on his promise to hit back at China by enacting up to $60 billion of tariffs. The administration has also dropped more than a few hints it prefers a weaker dollar to help U.S. manufacturers.
China, which holds more U.S. government debt than any other foreign creditor, responded with levies of its own and signaled that “all options,” including scaling back its purchases of Treasuries, were on the table.
If the administration “not only abandoned the strong dollar policy but were intent on pushing the dollar down aggressively to secure trade advantages, that would diminish the currency’s luster as a reserve asset,’’ said Barry Eichengreen, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley and co-author of “How Global Currencies Work.”
Like all investors, “reserve managers are trying to read the political tea leaves as well as the financial arithmetic to figure out what’s next.’’
Trade Deals
Contrast Trump’s rhetoric with Europe’s recent moves to forge closer trade ties with Japan, China and much of Latin America, including Mexico and Brazil. The EU’s total trade with China has jumped almost 75 percent in the past decade to $590 billion in 2016, IMF figures compiled by Bloomberg show. On that basis, the EU is on the cusp of eclipsing the U.S. as China’s biggest trade partner.
Some still aren’t totally convinced. Even as the euro staged its biggest rally against the dollar since 2003 on the back of stronger growth, central banks pared their euro holdings last year, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The rise of populism across Europe -- notably, far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen’s surprising run in France’s presidential election and the stunning victories by anti-establishment parties in Italy -- may explain why reserve managers are reluctant to dive in, according to Eurizon SLJ Capital’s Stephen Jen.
Nordvig argues it won’t take much to move the needle. Central banks were so down on the euro that many eliminated the currency from their reserves altogether. In 2016, Brazil -- the 10th-largest holder of reserves -- held no euros. Saudi Arabia, the fourth-largest, had slightly more than 10 percent of its portfolio in euros, far less than the average.
“We think a pick-up in reserve demand is right around the corner,” said Zach Pandl, Goldman’s co-head of global FX strategy, who predicts central banks may funnel $300 billion into the euro over the next one to three years. “A lot of the preconditions that needed to be met are starting to come into view.”

1379,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 08:02AM ET</span>",Euro gains as risk appetite returns; kiwi flies,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro vaulted above the $1.24 line to the day's highs and relatively high-yielding currencies, including the Australian dollar, gained on Monday as stocks recovered, indicating investor appetite returned after Friday's brief sell-off.
But the dollar held close to a 16-month low against the Japanese yen  as broader markets remained wary about the greenback's outlook against the backdrop of concerns over a possible trade war.
""The Fed's statement last week, if anything, signals a more bullish outlook for the dollar, but we are seeing renewed weakness so this may be indicative of some structural rebalancing flows,"" said Richard Falkenhall, a senior FX strategist at SEB.
With positioning against the dollar at a one-year high, according to CFTC data, and the greenback recording its biggest weekly drop in a month against a basket of currencies last week, some investors prepared for a bounce.
But cracks widened, with the dollar plumbing to a 16-month low against the Japanese yen  to 104.56 earlier and was trading slightly above that low at 105.11 yen.
Against the euro, the dollar was trading at a 2-1/2 week low of $1.2417 (EUR=EBS), with the latest comments from Jens Weidmann, Germany's likely candidate to become the European Central Bank's next president, also offering some support.
Weidmann said market expectations of a rate hike towards the middle of next year were ""not completely unrealistic"", a view shared by the broader market, although some expect a rate hike by the first quarter of 2019.
Still, while the ECB is hinting at raising interest rates, the Federal Reserve is already in the midst of its rate hiking cycle, with bond markets expecting more than 100 basis points in hikes over the next year, according to Reuters data. 
Global markets were shaken last week after U.S. President Donald Trump moved to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, edging the world's two largest economies closer to a trade war, but latest reports indicated a slightly more selective stance.
The United States asked China in a letter last week to cut the tariff on U.S. autos, buy more U.S.-made semiconductors and give U.S. firms greater access to the Chinese financial sector, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing unnamed sources.
U.S. stock futures (ESc1) were up 1.4 percent in London trade after major U.S indices fell sharply on Friday. (N)
""Risk sentiment remains cautious and we remain bearish on the dollar's outlook in the absence of any fundamental changes despite the rate differential factor supporting the greenback,"" said Manuel Oliveri, an FX strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London.
Against a broad basket of its rivals, the dollar (DXY) edged 0.3 percent lower after last week's 0.8 percent fall.
The dollar's strength against the yen was also due to Japanese factors such as growing views that a political scandal in Tokyo could deepen, with a figure in a cronyism controversy surrounding Prime Minister Shinzo Abe due to testify in parliament on Tuesday.
The prime minister's ""Abenomics"" economic measures have been a factor in pulling the yen down over the past few years to the benefit of Japanese exporters. Any event that leads to a decline in his support ratings is seen weakening his ability to keep Abenomics in place.
""With worries about the United States and China locking horns on trade issues and Japan's parliamentary testimony coming up on Tuesday, few participants are willing to buy the dollar,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities.
According to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday, speculators' net short positioning on the yen shrank rapidly to roughly 22,000 contracts in the latest week, the smallest since November 2016, from a net short position of about 79,500 contracts.
The Australian dollar added 0.6 percent to $0.7749  and the New Zealand dollar  gained nearly 1 percent to $0.7297, in a further sign that risk aversion was fading from the markets for now.

1382,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 01:00AM ET</span>","Dollar hits 16-month lows vs. yen as trade fears, Japanese political woes hurt","By Shinichi Saoshiro
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar slipped to a 16-month low against the yen on Monday, pressured by lingering fears of a global trade war and a political crisis that has engulfed Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
The U.S. currency traded at 104.955 yen after falling to 104.560, its weakest since November 2016.
The dollar had already slumped 1.2 percent versus its Japanese peer last week as escalating trade tensions between the United States and China stoked concerns about global growth.
Global markets were shaken after U.S. President Donald Trump moved to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, edging the world's two largest economies closer to a trade war.
Views that Japan's political scandal could deepen was also seen lifting the yen, with a key figure in a cronyism controversy gripping Abe due to testify in parliament on Tuesday.
Economic measures dubbed ""Abenomics"" initiated by Abe has been a factor that has pulled the yen down over the past few years to the benefit of exporters. Any event that leads to a decline in the premier's support ratings is seen weakening his ability to keep Abenomics in place.
""With worries about the United States and China locking horns on trade issues and Japan's parliamentary testimony coming up on Tuesday, few participants are willing to buy the dollar,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities.
""It really is typical 'risk off' trades dominating right now, with the yen and Swiss franc the big beneficiaries. But more speculators are jumping in, and any reversals could be sudden and violent.""
According to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday, speculators' net short positioning on the yen shrank rapidly to roughly 22,000 contracts in the latest week, the smallest since November 2016, from a net short position of about 79,500 contracts.
""Even if a fresh round of speculative moves betting on yen strength emerges, dollar/yen's fall is likely to sputter out before the pair reaches 100 yen,"" said Koji Fukaya, president at FPG Securities.
During past episodes of turmoil such as the European debt crisis in 2016, participants had more reason to actively buy the Japanese currency but the situation has changed this time around with the U.S. economy stronger and their yields higher, Fukaya said.
The Swiss franc was little changed at 0.9468 franc per dollar after gaining 0.55 percent against the greenback last week.
The euro gained 0.2 percent to $1.2372 after rising 0.5 percent last week.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was steady at 89.397 and in close reach of a one-month low of 89.356 set last week.

The Australian dollar added 0.4 percent to $0.7727 and the New Zealand dollar gained 0.6 percent to $0.7270.

President Donald Trump signed a memorandum that would implement tariffs on up to $60 billion in imports from China on Thursday.
The tariffs largely focus on technology sector goods and were intended to penalize China for, according to the Trump administration, stealing intellectual property.
In response, China on Friday proposed a list of 128 U.S. products as potential retaliation targets, according to a government statement.
Adding to risk-averse sentiment, Trump named John Bolton as his National Security Adviser late Thursday. Bolton is known for calls to use military force against both North Korea and Iran.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, ended down 0.4% at 89.10 by close of trade. It fell to its lowest since Feb. 19 at 88.98 at one point.
For the week, the index lost roughly 1.3%, its worst weekly performance in over a month.
The dollar was already on the back foot a day earlier after the Federal Reserve gave guidance on the pace of interest rate rises that was less aggressive than some investors had expected.
The yen, often viewed as a safe-haven currency in times of market turbulence and economic uncertainty, rose to a 16-month high against the dollar. The greenback was last down 0.5% at 104.74.
On the week, the yen rallied 1.1% against the buck.
The dollar also slipped 0.2% against the Swiss franc, another currency bought in times of market uncertainty.
Meanwhile, the British pound inched higher after Bank of England rate-setter Gertjan Vlieghe said that interest rates will probably need to rise once or twice a year over the next few years, comments that are likely to help cement investors' expectations of a BoE rate hike in May.
The euro was also a shade higher against the dollar, with EUR/USD gaining 0.4% to 1.2352.
In the week ahead, rhetoric rather than economics could be the main driver of sentiment, as investors watch further developments amid a brewing trade war between the U.S. and China.
On the data front, the final reading of fourth-quarter U.S. growth will be the highlight of the holiday-shortened week. Markets stateside will remain closed on Friday for Good Friday.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.45% to a five-week low of 89.07.
Following the U.S.’s move to slap tariffs of up to $60 billion on Chinese imports, China's commerce ministry proposed a list of 128 U.S. goods as potential retaliation targets, raising the prospect of tit-for-tat war between two the world’s largest economies.
The U.S. goods, which had an import value of $3 billion in 2017, include wine, fresh fruit, dried fruit and nuts, steel pipes, modified ethanol, and ginseng, the ministry said. Those products could see a 15% duty, while a 25% tariff could be imposed on U.S. pork and recycled aluminium goods, according to a statement on the commerce ministry website.
The yen – which has served as the preferred safe-haven proxy amid trade-war fears – rose sharply, pressuring USD/JPY to Y104.88, down 0.38%, a nearly 17-month low.
Also weighing on the dollar was a tweet from U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to veto a $1.3 trillion spending bill amid both a lack of funding for the border wall and U.S. lawmakers efforts to extend the DACA program.



The government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. ET on Saturday if Trump does not sign a funding bill into law.
Fears that Trump may veto the bill together with trade war angst overshadowed positive data and a slew of somewhat hawkish from Federal Reserve officials.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday Core Durable Goods Orders rose 1.2% last month, beating economist forecast for a 1.5% rise.
Atlanta Federal Reserve president Raphael Bostic said he would support further rate hikes this year and added that he expects inflation to hit the Fed’s 2% target. While Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari admitted that he was one the FOMC members that voted for a rate hike this past week but warned that the Federal Reserve cannot ignore the risk of a full-fledged trade war.

1386,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 11:01AM ET</span>",Venezuelans suspicious of currency rebrand amid hyperinflation,"By Deisy Buitrago
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelans said on Friday they lacked confidence in President Nicolas Maduro’s decision to knock three digits off the country’s ailing bolivar currency amid soaring hyperinflation.
The measure to divide the bolivar by 1,000 will take effect from June 4, the leader announced on Thursday. New notes will be issued although there will be no change in the bolivar’s value.
Critics said the move would have no impact on the crisis-wrecked economy and just covers up soaring prices and a collapsing currency. 
Millions in Venezuela earn just a dollar or two a month at black market rates and suffer food and medicine shortages. Prices rose more than 2,600 percent in the last year, according to the National Assembly. There is a severe cash crisis.
""An authoritarian government does anything it wants. This is not going to stop inflation,"" said Jose Vasquez, 46, selling coffee at the exit of a subway station in the eastern part of Caracas. 
The bolivar has fallen 99.99 percent against the U.S. dollar on the black market since Maduro came to power in April 2013. A $100 purchase of bolivars then would now be worth just a single U.S. cent. 
If inflation continues as it has over the last year, anotherredenomination will be required in 20 months. ""It's a cosmetic measure, which does not impact the bottom line,"" said local economist Asdrubal Oliveros. 
""After a few months you will have to continue issuing new bills or decide to remove more zeros (from) the currency,"" added Oliveros. 
Maduro blames Venezuela’s economic crisis on Washington and the country’s opposition. He faces re-election in May, though is likely to win against an opposition that has largely boycotted the vote. 

Central bank president Ramón Lobo told state television that the measure seeks to ""attack inflation and reduce the shortage of cash.""

1387,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 10:02AM ET</span>",Currency Traders Shouldn't Dismiss the Dollar's Chances Just Yet,"(Bloomberg) -- Analysts and traders looking for the dollar to remain under pressure throughout the year could be in for a surprise.
With the greenback extending last year’s drop into 2018 on the back of surging growth overseas and expectations of central bank tightening in Europe and Japan, markets are positioned for more weakness and forecasters see the Dollar Index heading lower. However, investors may be overestimating the headwinds and underestimating the tailwinds for the U.S. currency.
Certainly, dollar bulls had their hopes dashed this week. The greenback, as measured by the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, was on the verge of sending a strong bullish technical signal when it closed on Tuesday above its 55-daily moving average for the first time in three months, threatening analyst calls for a euro at $1.30 and the yen at 100 per dollar by year-end.
But a less hawkish-than-expected communique from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday prompted the dollar to post its biggest sell-off in almost two months, preventing the gauge from closing above that key level for a second day. That was seen negating, or at least postponing, what could be the start of a fresh dollar rally.
However, with almost half of Fed policy makers projecting at least four interest rate increases for 2018, upside risks prevail for the currency given market pricing. Overnight index swap curves suggest that policy makers won’t move three more times until June 2019.
A lack of a meaningful pick-up in price pressure and wage inflation keeping Powell and colleagues cautious isn’t the only burden on the dollar. Uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump’s administration has always been a drag for the greenback, with the U.S. President’s protectionist stance doing the currency no favors.
Still, following the initial headlines and the market’s response to sell the greenback on the belief that the U.S. economy would be hurt by a global trade war, signs quickly emerged that tariff exclusions would be the norm. With that signaling any trade conflict would be mainly contained between the U.S. and China, leveraged accounts that hold dollar shorts at levels close to a three-year low may have to trim back exposure.
Dollar bulls have other potential sources of support. Fading geopolitical risks after Trump’s decision to meet with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and the aversion of a government shutdown may also back the greenback. And technically, the dollar gauge has rebounded twice this year from a strong weekly Fibonacci support about one percent away from its current level.
Dollar liquidity could be a further factor that pushes traders to fall back in love with the U.S. currency. Tighter dollar funding conditions, as seen through the Libor-OIS spread that has widened to the most since 2009, could see emerging-market exposure that utilized greenback funding to be cut back.
Analysis of the volatility-term structure in euro-dollar and dollar-yen, which together have an almost 50 percent weighting in the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, shows options traders see double the chance that the greenback trades 3 percent lower than higher versus its major peers by the end of the year.
This may not only be a reflection of dollar bearishness, but also shows investor appetite to get long currencies where central banks are ready to exit extraordinary stimulus. The European Central Bank is expected to end its quantitative-easing program by December at the latest before hiking rates in the first half of next year, while Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said officials will start thinking about how to exit their unprecedented easing around fiscal year 2019.
However, policy makers on both fronts have urged cautiousness and investors face risk of disappointment should central banks move slower than expected. Euro-area data has begun to lose momentum, while Japanese inflation has yet to show it can beat its U.S. counterpart easily. The ECB and the BOJ could eventually enter a hiking rate cycle that resembles more of a Bank of England-style “one and done,” rather than a Fed-like sequence.
There is already a lot of negativity priced in the dollar and much hype into assets outside the U.S. A positive surprise for the greenback could be closer than many think.

1390,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 10:42PM ET</span>",Venezuela knocks three zeros off ailing currency amid hyperinflation,"By Corina Pons and Deisy Buitrago
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro ordered a re-denomination of the ailing bolivar currency on Thursday, by knocking three zeroes off amid hyperinflation and a crippling economic crisis.
The measure to divide the so-called bolivar fuerte - or “strong bolivar” - currency by 1,000 would take effect from June 4, the socialist leader said. It would not have any impact on the bolivar's value.
The move illustrates the collapse of the bolivar, which has fallen 99.99 percent against the U.S. dollar on the black market since Maduro came to power in April 2013. A $100 purchase of bolivars then would now be worth just a single U.S. cent.
But Maduro, 55, presented the move as a positive development intended to protect Venezuela against currency speculators and a U.S.-led “economic war” against the OPEC member.
Critics said the currency measure was no panacea for Venezuela's economic mess and just a psychological ploy to make Venezuelans forget the extent of the hyperinflation.
While the move sounds like a currency revaluation, economists consider it a currency re-denomination as the country is not changing the value of its official exchange rate.
Venezuelans will not need to turn in the currency now in their wallets but all new currency printed or minted will be in the new denominations.
Millions of Venezuelans are suffering from shortages of food and medicines during a fifth year of recession that critics blame on government incompetence and corruption, but Maduro says is due to Western hostility against him plus the fall of oil prices.
“Venezuela has been victim of a brutal, economic war,” said Maduro, whose government has been targeted by the United States, European Union and Canada for sanctions over allegations of abusing democracy and rights.
Maduro made the announcement during an event shown live on TV, flanked by aides and bankers, to discuss Venezuela’s new petro cryptocurrency.
Venezuela’s government similarly re-denominated its currency by knocking off three zeroes a decade ago.
Prices in Venezuela rose 6,147 percent in the 12 months through February, according to estimates by the country’s opposition-led National Assembly, broadly in line with independent economists’ figures.
Maduro is running for re-election on May 20 in a vote critics say is rigged to extend the socialists’ rule.
The opposition coalition is boycotting the vote, though one leader Henri Falcon has broken ranks to run against Maduro. He is promising to dollarize Venezuela’s economy as a way to beat hyperinflation and regain investor confidence.
""Amid the biggest economic collapse in the history of Latin America, the government of Nicolas Maduro attempts to hide hyperinflation by knocking zeros off the currency,"" said Francisco Rodriguez, a Venezuelan economist and Wall Street analyst working as Falcon's chief economic adviser.

1391,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 04:31PM ET</span>",Here's Why Wells Fargo Sees a Trade War Benefiting the Greenback,"(Bloomberg) -- While the dollar has few fans among Wall Street strategists,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) predicts that the greenback stands to gain from escalating trade tensions.
President Donald Trump ordered sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods Thursday, prompting concern that America’s largest foreign creditor will retaliate. But Wells Fargo predicts that the row could revive the greenback. The Bloomberg dollar index gained Thursday, paring its 2018 drop to about 2.9 percent, while U.S. stocks slumped.
For Wells Fargo, the prospect of a trade war poses a risk for its broader 2018 outlook, which is for a weaker U.S. currency. What it boils down to is their view that a wave of protectionism could lead to narrower American trade deficits, feeding through into dollar strength.
“We are of the view that any sort of trade war scenario would likely be dollar-positive,” said Erik Nelson, a currency strategist at the bank. “The U.S. economy is probably positioned to be hurt the least in such a scenario and the U.S. dollar has shown some risk-off behavior in recent months.”
The consensus is leaning in the other direction, partly on speculation that Chinese retaliation or a tit-for-tat trade war would crimp foreign demand for U.S. assets. For one thing, with the U.S. facing swelling budget deficits, there’s a sense that the dollar is vulnerable should international buyers shun American debt.
For Nelson, a trade war would benefit the greenback in particular against currencies of emerging-market countries that have large trade surpluses with the U.S. and are sensitive to global equity weakness.
That list includes currencies such as the Mexican peso, South Korean won and the ruble.
“Today’s market move (weaker equities, stronger USD) is definitely consistent with the pattern we have seen in recent months, and moreover I think is a fairly telling indication of what could occur in a trade-war scenario,” Nelson wrote in an email."
1392,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",Forex - Traders Pile Into Cheaper Dollar Despite Growing Trade War Fears,"Investing.com – The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies as traders took advantage of the cheaper greenback after it fell to a one-month on trade war fears. 
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.20% to 89.45 bouncing from a low of 89.00. 
President Donald Trump was set to impose about $50 trillion tariff on Chinese imports to penalize China for trade practices that the Trump administration said involve stealing American companies’ intellectual property. 
Investors fear the move could spark a tit-for-tat trade war with China, with the latter said to be considering retaliatory measures against US tariffs including imposing tariffs on U.S. semiconductor companies, which have high revenue exposure to China and also agricultural products such as soybeans. 
The yen – which has served as the preferred safe-haven proxy during trade-war fears – tacked on gains, pressuring on the dollar as USD/JPY fell to low of Y105.27 but has since recovered some losses to trade at Y105.69. 
The dollar’s recovery from one-month lows was stifled somewhat as investors continued to mull the Federal Reserve’s dovish outlook on Wednesday after the central bank raised interest rate but failed to add a fourth rate hike to its projections.
The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) did, however, signal a faster path of rate hikes for 2019 and 2020 but analysts have played down the FOMC’s hawkish outlook on rates. 
“Despite the FOMC's more hawkish path, we continue to expect the Fed to hike 3 times total this year, stopping after the September meeting to assess how much further it is willing to push real rates into positive territory, and facing tighter financial conditions,” Morgan Stanley said. 
“After pausing, we look for two additional hikes in 2019, where we think the tightening cycle ends at 2.625%,” the bank added.
Offsetting those headwinds, however, was a fall in GBP/USD to $1.4105, down 0.25%, after the Bank of England left rates unchanged Thursday. 
EUR/USD fell 0.25% to $1.2306 while USD/CAD gained 0.03% to C$1.2906 as the latter pair benefitted from a fall in oil prices which weighed on the loonie."

U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to announce $60 billion on Thursday in tariffs on Chinese imports directed at its technology sector and aimed at curbing the theft of U.S. technology.
China is already preparing to retaliate with tariffs focused on U.S. exports of soybeans, sorghum and live hogs. The news has prompted fresh fears of a global trade war. Trump has already imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports but has exempt the European Union, Mexico, Canada and five other countries in order to negotiate new trade agreements.

1397,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 02:40AM ET</span>","Rupee and rupiah seen vulnerable to U.S. rates, tantrums not expected","By Patturaja Murugaboopathy 
(Reuters) - Rising U.S. interest rates are considered likely to undermine the high-yielding Indian rupee and Indonesian rupiah, but less this time around than during the U.S. Federal Reserve's 2013 'taper-tantrum'. 
Both currencies have fallen sharply since the beginning of the year, alongside a rise in expectations for improved global growth and faster policy tightening by the Fed. 
The Fed raised its interest rates by a quarter percent on Wednesday, and forecast two more hikes for 2018, highlighting its growing confidence that tax cuts and government spending will boost the U.S. economy.
The recent falls in the rupee and rupiah are reminiscent of the 2013 selloff when foreign investors fled emerging-Asia markets after the Fed signaled an end to ultra-easy crisis policy.
But analysts now point to higher real yields, healthier balance of payments accounts and expanded currency reserves as reasons to worry less about a recurrence. 
""I don't expect both Indian rupee and Indonesian rupiah to weaken to the extent that we saw in 2013 during the taper tantrum,"" said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ Banking Group in Singapore.
""The main difference is that the economic fundamentals in both India and Indonesia are much improved compared to 2013. While both countries still run current account deficits, the deficits have improved much in the last four to five years.""
Data from central banks showed the two countries have accumulated large reserves of foreign exchange since 2013, which could cushion them against financial shocks and volatility.
In January, India's foreign reserves were a record $422 billion, while Indonesia's hit a record $131 billion.
(GRAPHIC: India and Indonesis FX Reserves - http://reut.rs/2pvIdnO) 
Though the yield premiums of Indian and Indonesian bonds over U.S. Treasuries have narrowed this year, their real yields - nominal yields adjusted for inflation - are still among the highest in emerging markets.
These higher real yields are also partly driven by moderate inflation, with the two oil-importing countries aiming to keep inflation under control even in the face of rising crude oil prices.
India's annual wholesale price inflation eased for the third straight month in February after touching an eight-month high in November, while Indonesia's headline inflation rate also slowed in the last month.
(GRAPHIC: India and Indonesia real rates - http://reut.rs/2GcKs99)
""It is too early to worry about overheating or a sharp rise in inflation given subdued credit growth in both economies,"" HSBC said in a report this month.
Even though the two countries saw sharp foreign outflows in February, some analysts are bullish that money will flow back in coming months.
From June 1 rupiah bonds will be eligible for inclusion in the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Global Aggregate Bond Index, and some market participants expect the foreign investment limit in Indian bonds to be increased because it is nearing exhaustion.
HSBC expects $4 billion of new passive inflows into Indonesian bonds thanks to their inclusion in the global index. The bank also predicts an inflow of $7-8 billion into Indian government bonds if the foreign investment limit is raised by 1 percentage point to 6 percent.
The one sticking point is currency volatility. Foreigners have been reducing their holding of Indonesian bonds since early 2017 because the currency has not appreciated. An appreciating currency multiplies their return on bond holdings. 
The rupee has fallen about 2 percent this year and the rupiah 1.3 percent. A further drop or increased volatility could cause more foreign portfolio investors to withdraw.
(GRAPHIC: Foreign flows into India and Indonesian assets - http://reut.rs/2pwOpLs) 
ANZ's Goh expects the rupiah to perform better than rupee this year.
""We are expecting a slight appreciation from current levels. We believe that the selloff seen in the rupiah since late January was little bit overdone and the rupiah is looking undervalued at current levels,"" Goh said.
In real effective exchange rate (REER) terms - which is calculated on a trade-weighted basis against a basket of currencies and adjusted for inflation - the rupiah is currently trading 5 percent lower than its 10-year average. On the other hand, the rupee is trading 8 percent above its average.
""The rupee is slightly overvalued. There is further room for the rupee to weaken on the back of a slightly worsening current account and prospects for high inflation,"" said Goh.
""But the depreciation will not be to that extent (as during taper-tantrum).""

1398,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 11:21PM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar Down After Fed Decision and Likely China Tariffs ,"Investing.com – The dollar continued to lose ground in morning trading in Asia Thursday, hours after the U.S. Federal Reserve moved to raise interest rates and China followed suit. The dollar was also pressured by fears of a trade war, with U.S. President Donald Trump all but set to announce a new set of tariffs against China.
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies dropped to 89.13 at 11:21 ET (03:21 GMT), down 0.13%. The dollar continued to slide despite the Federal Reserve raising interest rates at its meeting on Wednesday.
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised its benchmark interest rate target range 0.25% to between 1.5% and 1.75%, which puts the effective funds rate at about 1.63%, the highest level since 2008. In raising the rate, the Fed noted that “the economic outlook has strengthened in recent months.” However, the Fed did not indicate that it was likely to raise rates four times this year and kept inflation forecasts steady.
Adding to the pressure on the dollar was the expectation that Trump would announce on Thursday a new set of tariffs against $50 billion of Chinese imports, particularly in the high-technology sector. The new tariffs follow an investigation by the US Trade Representative (USTR) into Chinese trade practices. The investigation suggested state-led efforts in China to force US companies to disclose intellectual property.
In Mainland China, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) raised its own short-term market interest rates Thursday morning in Asia, following the US Fed’s move. The PBOC raised rates on reverse repurchase agreements by five basis points to 2.55%. The PBOC also pumped about $1.58 billion into the economy via seven-day reverse repos.
The USD/CNY pair was down 0.13% at mid-morning in Asia, with the Chinese yuan trading at 6.3173. The PBOC set the fix rate for the yuan against the dollar at 6.3167 on Thursday, compared to 6.3396 on Wednesday.
The Japanese yen, for its part, rose against the dollar. The USD/JPY pair shed 0.34% to 105.69, marking a continuation of a strengthening of the yen against the greenback as a refuge against risk but also thanks to a commitment by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to keep an ultra-loose monetary policy.
BOJ’s deputy governor Masayoshi Amamiya garnered some attention on Wednesday when he said the BOJ has not ruled out adjusting the yield curve even before inflation reached the 2% target which Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said policy normalisation is still far away.
The AUD/USD pair traded at 0.7742, down 0.0023%, giving up some gains from the fay earlier. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported a surge in jobs on Thursday morning. Employment increased by 17,500 in seasonally adjusted terms during February, less than the expected increase of 20,000 but the 17th consecutive month of growth."

LONDON (Reuters) - The threat of a global trade war and a steady message from the Federal Reserve on U.S. interest rates pushed the dollar to its lowest in over a month on Thursday, and took Europe's main share markets into the red.
It was the dollar's third decline in four sessions and helped Britain's pound  to a six-week high after a Bank of England policy meeting laid the foundations for another UK rate increase in the coming months.
The Fed raised its key rate by 25 basis points to 1.75 percent on Wednesday and flagged at least two more increases were likely this year. But it stopped short of pointing to the three that some economists had been predicting.
China also nudged up its borrowing costs overnight, as Beijing braced for new tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump on Chinese imports worth as much as $60 billion.
Not all Fed bulls were discouraged, though. ""Over the balance of the year we do think they will move to four hikes,"" said JP Morgan Asset Management's Seamus Mac Gorain, highlighting the impact of recent fiscal stimulus.
Trade tariffs were a risk but more open economies such as Mexico or the euro zone could be more at risk than the United States, he said.
Those jitters, plus weaker-than-expected German business confidence data, caused European shares (STOXX) to fall 1 percent to a two-week low.
U.S. stocks were also set to open lower, with S&P 500 futures (ESc1) down 0.7 percent in pre-market trades. 
Shares in tech giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were set to fall for a third successive day after its chief executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized for a ""major breach of trust"" over how it had handled data belonging to 50 million users.
In the currency market, the British pound  hit a high of $1.4216, its highest in more than a month. 
The Bank of England kept rates steady on Thursday but two of its policymakers unexpectedly voted for an immediate rate rise, in a statement that will boost investors' confidence that borrowing costs will rise in May.
Bond yields - which move inversely to price - fell broadly. Borrowing costs on 30-year German debt hit their lowest level of the year.
Two-year U.S. yields slipped to 2.305 percent (US2YT=RR) from 9 1/2-year high of 2.366 percent. The 10-year yield fell below 2.85 percent (US10YT=RR), its biggest move in three weeks.
""The threat of protectionism is dampening the mood in the German economy,"" said Clemens Fuest, the chief of the Munich-based Ifo institute, which published the business sentiment data.

Japan's Nikkei (N225) rose 1.0 percent as investors went bargain hunting after a difficult run for the market.
China hopes it can hold talks with the United States to achieve a ""win-win"" solution on trade, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in Beijing.
But worries were swirling of a more traditional kind of war. A widely read Chinese state-run newspaper said on Thursday that the country should prepare for military action over Taiwan.
Beijing was infuriated after Donald Trump signed legislation last week that encourages the United States to send senior officials to Taiwan to meet Taiwanese counterparts and vice versa. 
Concern about a trade war between the world's two largest economies also put commodity markets on guard. 
Oil prices gave up earlier gains to leave Brent crude futures (LCOc1) at $68.98 per barrel and U.S. crude (CLc1) at $64.76 a barrel.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for May delivery rose 2.6% to settle at $65.17 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent rose 3.13% to trade at $69.53 a barrel.
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by 2.622 million barrels for the week ended March 16, confounding expectations for  a rise of 2.6 million barrels.
Gasoline inventories – one of the products that crude is refined into – fell by 1.693 million barrels, missing expectations for a decline of 2.008 million barrels, while supplies of distillate – the class of fuels that includes diesel and heating oil – fell by 2.022 million barrels, beating expectations for a decline of 1.746 million barrels.
The fall in crude supplies comes as data showed US crude imports fell by 508,000 barrels per day last week and somewhat eased investor concerns that faster pace of production would lead to uptick in the crude stockpiles.
Despite refinery maintenance hitting a peak this month, the refinery utilization rate rose 1.7 percentage points, beating estimates for a 0.3 percentage point decline.
Also supporting crude prices was growing expectations that President Donald Trump may adopt a tougher stance on Iran amid a visit from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman this week.
Some have suggested that the president may look to reimpose sanctions on Iran, raising the prospect of Middle East supply disruptions as countries would be pressured to reduce their purchases of Iranian crude."

The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is slated to reveal its decision on interest rate Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET, with many expecting the central bank to raise rates by 0.25% to a 1.50% to 1.75% range.
The Summary of Economic Projections on inflation, unemployment and economic growth (GDP) will also accompany the release of the FOMC policy decision. 
Market focus is likely to be on the “dot plot,” which shows where each FOMC member in the meeting thinks the interest rates are heading at the end of the year for the next few years and in the longer run. 
Following the Fed’s somewhat hawkish turn in sentiment on monetary policy, some market participants expect the FOMC to up its rate-hike projection for 2018, to four rate hikes from three rate hikes. Fed chair Jerome Powell's press conference, which follows the monetary policy statement, is also expected to garner attention for clues on whether the leader of Fed continues to hold an optimistic view on inflation and economic growth. 
Focus on the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting overshadowed positive economic data pointing to a rebound in U.S. housing market activity. 
The Commerce Department said existing home sales increased 3% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 million units. Economists were expecting a 0.5% increase to 5.41 million units.

Trans Pacific Partnership is aimed at cutting trade barriers in some of the fastest-growing economies of the Asia-Pacific region. The original 12-member deal was thrown into limbo early last year when President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from it, citing concerns about protecting U.S. jobs.
""Our focus at the moment, is obviously we’re working on renegotiation of NAFTA, we’re very focused on our trading relationship with China, which is way too much in one direction. Our markets are open to them, their markets are not open to us, on the same basis,"" Mnuchin said at a news conference.
He was in Chile following a two day meeting of officials from the world's 20 biggest economies in neighboring Argentina on Monday and Tuesday. 
""But as we accomplish our goals on these other trading relationships, this (TPP) is definitely something that we will consider and Chile will be a big partner of ours in that at the right time,"" Mnuchin said.
Trump on Monday signed an executive order barring any U.S.-based financial transactions involving Venezuela's new petro cryptocurrency, as U.S. officials warned that it was a ""scam"" by President Nicolas Maduro's government to further undermine democracy in the OPEC country.
Mnuchin said U.S. sanctions against Venezuela are directed not at the population of the country but at individuals who are taking resources from the Venezuelan people.

He said it was important that other countries and the European Union join in sanctioning Venezuela. Critics accuse Maduro of turning Venezuela into a dictatorship. His government says the sanctions break international law.

Gold is sensitive to moves higher in the U.S. dollar – a stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency, thus, reduces investor demand for the precious metal.
FOMC members are expected to vote to raise the Federal Reserve’s benchmark rate by 0.25% to range of 1.50% to 1.75%. Current investor expectations are for three 0.25% rate hikes total 2018, which would leave the Fed’s benchmark rate at range of 2.00% to 2.25% by year-end. 
That could change on Wednesday, however, with the release of the FOMC\'s Summary of Economy Projections which will include the closely watched “dot plots,” showing where each FOMC member in the meeting thinks that interest rates are heading at the end of the year for the next few years and in the longer run. 
“Along with a 25 basis point hike, the Fed should sound more upbeat at the March FOMC, with a better balance of risks,” said TD Securities. “The 2018 median dot should stay at 3 hikes for 2018, which may be dovish as markets anticipate the Fed moving to 4. We expect the 2019 dot to rise, but the longer-run dot to stay at 2.75%.\"" 
In other precious metal trade, silver futures fell 0.80% to $169.20 a troy ounce, while platinum futures fell 1.05% to $944.80 an ounce.
Copper fell 1.27% to $3.08, while natural gas rose 0.45% to $2.67."
1408,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 01:34PM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar Rides Fed Rate Hike Expectations to Session Highs,"Investing.com – The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies amid expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise rates for the first time this year on Wednesday. 
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.47% to 89.90. 
The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting got underway Tuesday, with a decision on monetary policy expected to following Wednesday, accompanied by the release of the Summary of Economic Projections on inflation, unemployment and economic growth (GDP). 
The “dot plot,” – shows where each FOMC member in the meeting thinks the interest rates are heading at the end of the year for the next few years and in the longer run – is expected to garner the most investor attention. 
In December, the Fed’s “dot plot” indicated the median forecast was a total of three rate hikes in 2018, however, recent language among the Fed members include chairman Jerome Powell has turned hawkish, raising the prospect of a fourth rate hike for 2018. 
Market participants are also likely to look beyond 2018 to gauge FOMC members’ appetite to adopt a faster path to monetary policy tightening, with current expectations for the Fed’s funds rate to reach 2.7% in 2019. 
“The Fed is rarely as pre-emptive as it likes to think, but both nominal and real rates are very low, so we’re sticking to our view that rates will rise each quarter this year, with three further hikes next year,” Pantheon said. 
The dollar’s move higher was supported by a slump in EUR/USD to $1.2254, down 0.66%, as investors mulled a weaker-than-expected ZEW survey. 
GBP/USD fell 0.14% to $1.4007, giving up some of its gains from Monday, when news surfaced that Britain and EU agreed terms on Brexit-transition deal.

1409,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 11:01AM ET</span>","After Dollar's Jarring Plunge, Traders Face a 2018 Straitjacket","(Bloomberg) -- Foreign-exchange investors who grew accustomed to a one-way dollar trade over the past year suddenly face a new challenge: a sideways market.
A widely tracked gauge of the U.S. currency has been confined to a range of just 3 percent over the past two months, displaying signs of exhaustion after plunging as much as 15 percent since the start of 2017. The U.S. Dollar Index was up 0.6 percent in Tuesday trading in New York.
Yet even with analysts showing little confidence in a breakout by the end of next quarter, potential triggers that could free the dollar from its straitjacket lurk on the horizon.
The Tailwinds
1. Inflation: A sustained uptick would fuel more aggressive expectations for Fed policy tightening, supporting the dollar, analysts say. With U.S. consumer prices hovering around the central bank’s two percent target over the past six months, market participants will be keeping a close eye on the Fed’s economic projections due Wednesday for clues as to how officials see inflation -- and interest rate expectations -- progressing.
“We’re going to start to see higher inflation prints on a year-over-year basis in April, May and June,” said Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie Capital Inc. “People will start maybe thinking a little bit more constructively about Fed hikes and that could help the dollar.”
2. Trade tension: The threat of a global trade war looms after new White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow indicated last week the U.S. was readying a larger round of tariffs against Chinese imports following the announcement of duties on steel and aluminum. A full-blown trade war could wipe out $470 billion from global gross domestic product by 2020, Bloomberg Economics estimates. The damage to exports among America’s trading partners would likely fuel greenback gains, according to Erik Nelson, a currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities LLC.
“The U.S. runs trade deficits with a lot of other countries, and to the extent that those imbalances could narrow, that would be generally dollar supportive,” said Nelson. “If we do have a trade war and equities continue to weaken more perceptibly, you’d probably see a bigger pickup in the U.S. dollar. The U.S. is probably the best-positioned in the case of a trade war to probably be hurt the least.”
3. Positioning: Traders turned bearish on the greenback in June 2017 and continue to bet on further weakness, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. Dollar risk reversals, a gauge of sentiment and market positioning, have been sliding since 2015, briefly turning bearish on the greenback in January. Should futures and options traders become disappointed by the lack of momentum and cover short dollar positions, the U.S. currency could rapidly break out of its range to the upside.
The Headwinds
1. Monetary-policy convergence: Changing signals by central bankers outside the U.S. may inspire dollar selling as global growth accelerates. Conjecture about the timing of a European Central Bank rate hike received a shot in the arm Monday amid reports policy makers are shifting their debate to the future path of rate hikes, and are comfortable with market forecasts for an increase by mid-2019. Amid ongoing whispers the Bank of Japan will eventually begin to dial back its own quantitative easing, the yen has outperformed every Group-of-10 currency this year.
2. Trade wars (again): Analysts are far from agreement on the ultimate impact rising global trade tension will have on the dollar. Near-term, fears over increased U.S. tariffs have already forced America’s trading partners to refrain from stemming their currencies’ appreciation, helping fuel January’s dollar slump. If a wave of protectionist barriers were to weaken demand for the country’s financial assets, it could manifest as a longer-term structural headwind for the greenback.
“Crucial for the USD will be to determine what impact a further escalation of trade tensions could have on the demand for USD financial assets,” TD Securities USA strategists including Michael Hanson wrote in a March 9 note to clients. “The U.S. depends heavily on the ‘kindness of strangers’: foreign investors are needed to fund both its current account and federal budget deficits. Worse, these twin deficits are skewed towards growing ever more larger in the years ahead.”
3. Geopolitics: If international tensions were to flare and ignite risk-off sentiment, the dollar could suffer, particularly against its G-10 peers. On the horizon: U.S. President Donald Trump intends to meet with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un by the end of May, while the U.K. and Russia appear poised to ramp up retaliatory measures after Prime Minister Theresa May blamed Moscow for the poisoning of a former Russian spy on British soil. In the meantime, recent cabinet reshuffling in Washington has firms such as IG Markets saying political risk is a reason to sell the dollar.

1415,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 04:44AM ET</span>",Pakistani rupee weakens sharply in likely devaluation by central bank,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's rupee weakened sharply against the dollar on Tuesday in what appeared to be a currency devaluation by the central bank, traders said, the second such intervention in the last three months.
The rupee  plunged to about 115.5 per dollar in early trading from 110.5 at Monday's close, traders said. Abid Qamar, spokesman for the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), told Reuters the rupee plunge was a ""market driven"" event.
However, foreign exchange traders say the central bank's withdrawal of support for the rupee in daily market operations on Tuesday sent the currency lower.
The SBP devalued the local currency in a similar manner by about 5 percent in December amid balance of payments pressures due to a widening current account deficit and dwindling foreign reserves. The market was broadly expecting another devaluation this year.
""Apparently the central bank withdrew support,"" Fawad Khan, head of research at BMA Capital, told Reuters on Tuesday.
Withdrawal of support would have the effect of devaluing the currency as the SBP is the most influential player in the thinly-traded local foreign exchange market and controls what is widely considered a managed float system. 
In response to Reuters' queries about the rupee's decline on Tuesday, the central bank's Qamar said it was triggered by ""some payment pressures which are building within the market"" and added that the central bank would be ""observing the market where it is moving towards.""
Pakistan's economy has been growing at above 5 percent, the fastest pace in a decade, but a surge in imports has widened its current account deficit and prompted analysts to suggest the country may need an International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout in the coming 12 months.

""We believe this is much needed as Pakistan's external account has deteriorated as of late,"" the Topline Securities brokerage said in a flash note to clients on Tuesday morning after the rupee weakened.

The pair has been hit by a series of events recently, with some pressuring the pair due to risk aversion and some giving the pair a lift due to expectation of a rate hike. The hawkish Fed is sending the dollar up, but U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff plans hampered investors’ risk appetite.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Japanese yen raced to its highest level in more than 16 months and the Swiss franc surged on Friday as the growing threat of a trade war prompted investors to take shelter in perceived low-yielding currencies.
With short positions in the yen at near record highs, according to weekly positioning data, thanks to years of using the Japanese yen as a funding currency to buy high yielders, markets braced for some unwinding of those bets.
""Trade wars, the spike in dollar funding costs and a tricky quarter end means that currency markets can become a bit messy going into next week,"" said Marc Ostwald, a global strategist at ADM Investor Services International in London.
The dollar fell to as low as 104.635 yen on Friday, the greenback's lowest level since November 2016. The dollar was last down 0.5 percent at 104.80 yen .
The broad rise in the yen came as financial markets were rattled by worries over rising U.S.-China trade tensions.
U.S. President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum on Thursday that will target up to $60 billion of Chinese products with tariffs, but only after a 30-day consultation period that starts once a list of goods is published. 
The broad rise in the yen came as financial markets were rattled by worries over rising U.S.-China trade tensions.
A gauge of stress in the U.S. money markets climbed to its highest level in nearly nine years on Tuesday on concerns about growing costs for banks and other companies to borrow dollars and further interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve.
The gap between the three-month dollar London interbank offered rate  and three-month overnight indexed swap rate  expanded to 58 basis points, the widest since May 2009, according to Thomson Reuters data.
In a week that the U.S. Federal Reserve broadly stuck to its ""dot plot"" on future interest rate moves and signaled a relatively upbeat outlook for the economy, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields are on track to post its second biggest drop so far this year, further weighing on the greenback.
""The FX market itself isn't sure and its reaction to risk-off and lower bond yields across the board is to by the yen and the Swiss franc,"" Kit Juckes, an FX strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) wrote in a daily note.
Against a basket of its rivals, the dollar (DXY) was on track to fall 0.2 percent, taking its weekly losses to about 0.6 percent, its biggest drop in a month.
The Swiss franc  was also the other notable winner in currency markets this week with a 0.6 percent rise. 
In other currencies, sterling  was relatively stable in the backdrop of an EU summit with the British currency changing hands at $1.4107.

With the Fed widely expected to raise rates by a quarter point on Wednesday investors are focused on whether policymakers will forecast four rate hikes this year, rather than the three hikes they forecast in December.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher against a basket of rivals on Monday after posting four consecutive weeks of gains as financial markets braced for the first rate hike of the year from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
With new Fed Chair Jerome Powell's first monetary policy meeting this week, bond markets have already priced in one rate hike followed by two more later in the year. Investors will be closely watching whether Powell shifts expectations of future rate hike expectations.
Positioning data on some bank models such as  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) show investors have already begun unwinding their short positions on the dollar in the run-up to the policy this week, though futures data indicate reflect a slightly more cautious stance towards the dollar.
Risk aversion was also evident in financial markets with stock futures in Europe starting on a weaker note and the volatility index (VIX) firmer as the finance ministers of the 20 big world powers meet for a key G20 summit on Monday.
""There is a slight undertone of risk off sentiment that is supporting the dollar,"" said John Marley, head of FX strategy at Infinity International, a currency risk management firm. 
The dollar index (DXY) against a basket of six major peers rose 0.1 percent to 90.345. On Friday, the index hit a two-week high near 90.38, getting a boost after data showed a February surge in U.S. industrial production.
But investors warned against reading too much into the dollar bounce as the greenback was expected to remain weak, echoing the pattern of the past year by weakening in the aftermath of the rate hikes, according to strategists at BNP Paribas. 
Traders are also nervous after weekend polls suggested a massive drop in public support for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe over his handling of a festering cronyism scandal, which has raised doubts about his ability to press forward with his reflationary economic agenda including monetary easing.
Speaking in parliament on Monday, Abe took responsibility for a loss of trust in his government, but denied he or his wife had intervened in a land sale to a school operator with ties to his wife.

1425,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>",Investors eye currencies for those most at risk in a trade war,"By Tommy Wilkes and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - Foreign exchange markets appear convinced that a global trade war is unlikely to break out anytime soon, although with long bets on some currencies at record highs, investors fear complacency may be setting in.
While the Trump administration's threat to slap tariffs on Chinese imports has heightened fears of retaliation from Beijing, it has only mildly rattled markets enjoying a multi-year rally as global economic growth picks up.
The finance ministers of the 20 big world powers meet for a key G20 summit on Monday. Currency managers are keen to see whether diplomacy breaks out or disagreements deepen between the U.S. and others in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement on imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
Currencies don't like trade spats. President Obama's relatively narrow tariffs on Chinese steel in May 2016 saw the dollar index (DXY) fall more than 2 percent over a month. Against the yuan, it rose 2 percent . 
Similarly, within three months of President George Bush's March 2002 tariffs on EU steel imports, the dollar declined 6 percent.
The latest trade skirmishes come as global currency volatility slips back after a February spike off multi-year lows. It remains below levels seen in recent months, according to a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) volatility gauge. <.DBCVIX>
That leaves investors looking for early warning signs in currency markets that a broader shake-up of prices is coming.
Some currencies have moved as one would expect when smooth trade is under threat: The Canadian dollar has weakened and the Japanese yen has firmed, but the moves have for the most part been limited.
""The talk of trade wars at the moment is just that, talk. It's such a difficult thing to quantify it appears as if the market is just ignoring it,"" said Russell Silberston, a currencies manager at Investec Asset Management, which manages about $140 billion in assets.
""But don't get me wrong, we've got it (the prospect of a trade war) down as a key event risk.""
Currency repercussions should a trade war materialize would be significant because low volatility levels have driven investors to embrace higher-risk strategies. Speculative positions in emerging market currencies, for instance, stand at multi-year highs.
""I'm still amazed by the lack of a reaction in Asian currencies. They must be waiting for the Chinese retaliation,"" said Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio investments at Millennium Global, a currency investment manager in London.
""There would be quite meaningful moves. We are talking about Asian currencies that are at their strongest for years. There is zero of this (the risk of protectionism) priced in,"" he said.
(Graphic: FX volatility - http://reut.rs/2pfHuaa) 
Benson believes big Asian exporters are most at risk, including the South Korean won  and the Taiwanese dollar  as well as the Australian dollar  - a proxy for Asian economic growth.
The won and the Singapore dollar , another currency exposed to global trade flows, are trading near their strongest levels against the dollar in more than three years.
Among developed world currencies, Sweden's crown (EURSEK=) is tipped by some for a tough time - ING strategists point out Sweden is the second-most open economy in the G10 group of rich countries based on a ratio of trade and economic output. 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) sees the Canadian dollar  most at risk, while the U.S. and New Zealand dollars also look vulnerable. The Swiss franc and euro would emerge stronger, they said.
DOLLAR DILEMMA
Much of the confidence that the world will ride out Trump-inspired tariffs is because a sustained rebound in trade has buoyed growth, with the global economy set to expand at its fastest pace in six years.
While governments often move to protect local industry when growth is struggling, any Trump tariffs will come at a time when the world's biggest economic engines - the United States, Europe and China - are booming.
Another explanation for the currency calm is that many market watchers do not believe Trump will follow through on his threats. David Bloom, head of global currency research at HSBC, is convinced U.S. officials may find a weaker dollar an easier solution in their bid to slash the huge U.S. trade deficit.
So what does rising protectionism mean for the dollar? 
In the short-term, the dollar is likely to weaken, especially against the euro and yen. But should global growth tank or markets sink into a broader sell-off, the dollar should benefit from its status as a global reserve currency.
RISING YEN
Investors are at least convinced about one winner: the yen, backed by a huge current account surplus and its reputation as a safe-haven thanks to the trillions of dollars that Japanese investors have poured into overseas assets.
""If there is a trade war, the yen is the safe-haven currency of choice,"" said Manuel Oliveri, an FX strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR).
The yen has gained 6 percent so far this year and is near a 1-1/2 year high versus the dollar thanks in part to bets that the Bank of Japan will pull the plug on its massive bond-buying program.

SAN CRISTOBAL, Venezuela (Reuters) - A western Venezuelan city began to issue its own currency this week to alleviate the hyper-inflationary country's cash crisis.
The ""Elorza"" currency, with bills featuring the face of local independence leader Jose Andres Elorza, will be valid in the city of Elorza, near Venezuela's border with Colombia.
The bills are being sold in the municipality's offices to ensure that thousands of tourists and residents can trade, said mayor Solfreddy Solorzano, a member of the ruling Socialist Party.
Venezuela's national currency, the bolivar, has plummeted in recent years amid a crippling economic crisis. Prices are doubling nearly every month and basics such as food and medicine are nearly unavailable.
On top of that, there are shortages of cash itself making basic transactions impossible.
""People do not have bolivars to spend, so we created two denominations of notes,"" Solorzano said, adding that some 2 billion bolivars' worth of ""Elorza"" had been purchased — roughly $9,000 at the black market exchange rate.
Many in Venezuela earn the equivalent of just a dollar or two a month.
In December, a socialist collective in one of Caracas’ emblematic hilltop slums launched its own currency, the panal, to try to overcome cash shortages. One note features the face of late president Hugo Chavez.
The currency could be exchanged for rice that members of the community grew and harvested.
In Elorza, the mayor's office receives bolivars by bank transfer or debit card payment and, after discounting an 8 percent commission, gives ""Elorza"" in exchange.
People will be able to return the tickets to the mayor's office and claim a bolivar-denominated refund.
President Nicolas Maduro blames the country's crisis on an ""economic war"" being waged by Washington and the opposition, aimed at toppling his government. Critics blame strict currency and price controls and rapid money-printing.
The central bank has increased the total amount of currency in circulation by more than 50 percent in the last month alone, though cash-printing has not kept up.
Maduro says smugglers are taking Venezuelan bolivar notes over to Colombia.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held gains against a basket of peers on Friday, as recent concerns about the currency arising from trade tensions eased slightly and next week's Federal Reserve policy meeting came into focus.
The greenback, however, dipped versus the yen following a report by the Washington Post that U.S. President Donald Trump has decided to remove H.R. McMaster as his national security advisor.
Earlier this week, the U.S. currency took a hit after Trump dismissed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson as investors grew increasingly nervous about White House personnel changes.
The dollar was 0.3 percent lower at 106.020 yen , though managing to stay above an eight-day low of 105.790 set on Thursday.
The greenback was down about 0.5 percent on the week against the safe haven yen, which was boosted earlier as a political scandal engulfed Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, casting doubts on the sustainability of his economic stimulus policies.
""The best explanation for the impact the ongoing personnel changes taking place in the White House is that the dollar stands to weaken as it gets easier for President Trump to pursue protectionist policies,"" said Daisuke Karakama, chief market economist at Mizuho Bank in Tokyo.

""The market perhaps reacted excessively and the dollar was oversold, and now we are seeing those moves being balanced out as participants turn their focus on other events.""

The common currency was little changed on the week, failing to make much headway against its struggling U.S. peer as the European Central Bank has stressed that its exit from easy monetary policy would be very slow.
The Canadian dollar struggled near an eight-month low plumbed overnight, when soft housing data reinforced views that the Bank of Canada could slow down the pace of its interest rate hikes.
The loonie also came under pressure after President Trump's comments on commerce with Canada renewed trade concerns.

 Trade war concerns put pressure on the dollar this week, as U.S. President Donald Trump considered imposing tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports.
The news comes just a week after Trump imposed steep import tariffs on steel and aluminum, although Canada and Mexico are exempt as the administration seeks to negotiate a trade deal. More tariffs could increase fears of a global trade war and weigh on investor appetite for riskier assets.

1437,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 12:02PM ET</span>",`King Dollar' Kudlow Fighting Tide of Bearish Greenback Wagers,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration might have gained a strong-dollar advocate in Larry Kudlow, but the incoming White House economic adviser faces an uphill battle in stopping the greenback’s slide.
Former CNBC contributor Kudlow took to the network minutes after his appointment was announced Wednesday to endorse a higher dollar, saying that he would like to see the currency “a wee bit stronger.” Kudlow, 70, went so far as to make a trade recommendation: “I would buy King Dollar and I would sell gold.”
Kudlow might end up as another disappointed dollar bull. The consensus bet in markets is for a softer greenback, as seen in speculator positioning and inflows into unhedged foreign currency exchange-traded funds. And faced with escalating trade tensions and a widening U.S. current account deficit, even Kudlow’s vocal support likely won’t provide a lasting boost to the currency, according to Alvise Marino, a foreign-exchange strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG.
“Kudlow speaks about the strong dollar and says all the right things in terms of what markets want to hear, but at the same time, you have much wider fiscal funding requirements,” Marino said. “There’s so many more headwinds and they’re much more significant.”
Perhaps most prominent among those headwinds is the U.S. current account shortfall. Trump’s shoot-down of Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Ltd.’s takeover bid for Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. likely also sends a “somewhat hostile message” to overseas investors, which will further undermine the U.S.’s ability to fund the gap, according to Marino.
The dollar has slumped 2.7 percent to start the year, building upon an 8.5 percent loss in 2017. Bearish wagers on the currency outnumber bets on gains by 149,000 contracts, according to the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Distaste for the dollar is evident in ETF flows as well, with investors increasingly rotating out of hedged funds in favor of European and Japanese stocks without currency protection.
Also limiting the greenback’s upside in the wake of Kudlow’s jawboning might be the new adviser’s relative lack of clout, Marino said. Unlike U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who sent the dollar tumbling in January with his praise of a weaker greenback, Kudlow isn’t in a role that gives him any purview over the U.S. currency.
“He’s not in the Federal Reserve. He’s an adviser to the president,” Marino said. “He might influence things, but what we’ve seen in the last few days is a track record of very impulsive decisions that aren’t based on careful reasoning of the economic pros and cons.”"

The Fed is expected to hike rates three times this year, with the first hike anticipated at next week’s policy meeting.
At the same time, another report showed that U.S. initial jobless claims fell last week, pointing to continued strength in the labor market.
Separate reports showed that while manufacturing activity in the New York region rose robustly in March, factory activity in the Philadelphia area slowed slightly this month.

The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies last stood at 89.67 at 10:10pm ET, down 0.09%. The sentiment for the greenback remained bearish this week and the index dropped below the 90 mark.
After several high-profile departures from the White House including the pro-free-trade chief economic advisor Gary Cohn and the pro-dialogue State of Secretary Rex Tillerson, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is set to be populated by hawkish officials who embrace protectionism and military activity. The personnel reshuffle in the White House is renewing concerns over a potential global trade war and fueling uncertainty over developments in the Korean Peninsula, pushing investors to turn from the dollar to safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese yen.
In the latest personnel shakeup, Trump decided to appoint Larry Kudlow as the top economic advisor. Kudlow, previously known as a free trade advocate, reportedly said that China will be the target for tariffs, which increased the prospects of a U.S.-China trade war. Kudlow also hinted support for a stronger dollar in an interview with CNBC.
The USD/JPY pair shed 0.26% to 106.03, a rather sharp slump from Tuesday’s 107.20.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a two-day high against a basket of major currencies on Thursday, as traders braced for next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting at which the Fed is expected to raise interest rates.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.26 percent at 89.937.
""We think the dollar is consolidating ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting next week,"" said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in New York.
The outlook for the greenback, however, remains murky amid political uncertainty in the Trump administration and renewed worries about trade wars, analysts said.
""The Fed raised rates three times last year and the U.S. dollar still weakened overall, but surrounding each of those Fed interest rate increases there was some firming in the U.S. dollar, but then it tended to soften after,"" said Viloria.
The greenback found some support from upbeat U.S. data on Thursday, which showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week.
Other data on Thursday showed a rise in the prices of imported goods in February amid U.S. dollar weakness, bolstering expectations that inflation will pick up this year. Labor market strength and a steady increase in price pressures could allow the Federal Reserve to further raise interest rates at a gradual pace.
The greenback slipped 0.35 percent against the Japanese currency to 105.95 as trade tensions encouraged investors to buy the Japanese currency.
Traders are concerned about a U.S. shift towards increased protectionism under President Donald Trump's administration, with Wall Street rattled on Wednesday after the president sought to impose fresh tariffs on China. 
The yen is expected to benefit from any increase in trade protectionism, given Japan's strong current account surplus and the currency's reputation as a safe haven.
The Norwegian central bank kept rates on hold at 0.5 percent on Thursday but said it expected to raise rates after the summer, ""somewhat earlier"" than a previously forecast December hike, pushing the crown to a fresh four-month high against the euro.
The Swiss franc  was down slightly against the dollar after the Swiss Central Bank kept its ultra-loose monetary policy in place.
The New Zealand dollar came under pressure after mixed economic growth data there cemented bets on interest rates staying at record lows for a long time yet. 

The kiwi  slipped 0.55 percent against the greenback to $0.729 after weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter GDP data.

“A great country needs a strong currency, he knows that,” said Kudlow, after being chosen to replace Gary Cohn as director of the White House National Economic Council. ""I have no reason to believe that President Trump opposes a sound and stable dollar.”
Kudlow, an economist and CNBC contributor, offered his views on the dollar in an interview on the network Wednesday shortly after the White House announced he would take the role.
""I’m not saying the dollar has to go up 30 percent. I’m just saying, let the rest of the world know that we are going to keep the world’s international reserve currency steady,” Kudlow said. “That creates confidence at home and confidence overseas.”
Kudlow, who previously had criticized Trump’s tariffs policy, also said he is “on board” with duties Trump has imposed on steel and aluminum imports. He said he was encouraged by the president’s move to grant temporary waivers to allies including Canada and Mexico.
Kudlow also indicated the administration was readying a larger round of tariffs against Chinese imports. China has earned a “tough response” for not playing by the rules of trade, he said.
Earlier this month, he wrote a column for CNBC describing the president’s tariffs as “a regressive tax on low-income families.”
“Trump should also examine the historical record on tariffs, because they have almost never worked as intended and almost always deliver an unhappy ending,” Kudlow wrote in the March 3 column, which also included praise for other parts of the president’s economic agenda. Kudlow has strongly backed the tax overhaul that Trump signed at the end of last year.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.01% to 89.69. The dollar index traded as low as 89.54 Wednesday before rebounding.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that retail sales fell 0.1% last month. That confounded economists’ forecast for a 0.3% rise. The retail sales control group – which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP – fell 0.1% missing expectations for a 0.3% rise.
The Labor Department said on Wednesday its producer price index for final demand increased 0.2% last month. In the 12 months through February, the PPI rose 2.5% after rising 2.2% in the prior month.
Falling Retail sales and raising costs weighed on sentiment as analysts slashed their U.S. economic growth estimates for the first quarter despite the overarching narrative of a fundamentally sound consumer environment.
“The data set was a bad combination of firmer inflation and weaker consumption, thus we take down Q1 spending from 1.8% to 1.2% and GDP from 2.7% to 2.3%,” said Royal Bank of Canada. “We all know that consumer fundamentals are incredibly sound yet the consumer appears to be on a bit of a buyers strike over the last couple of months.”
Also adding to dollar weakness was a rise in the yen on an uptick in safe-haven demand as market participants fear President Donald Trump’s reported wish to slap $60 billion of tariffs on Chinese goods could mark the start of a trade war.
USD/JPY fell to Y106.30, down 0.26%.
GBP/USD was flat at $1.3964 while the EUR/USD fell 0.12% to $1.2376 as the latter came under pressure after ECB president Mario Draghi cited the appreciation in the euro and “spillovers” of U.S. tariffs as potential factors that could weigh on EU inflation.

1445,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 12:01PM ET</span>",Dollar Is `Big Loser' as Political Turmoil Fuels Trade-War Risk,"(Bloomberg) -- The latest upheaval in President Donald Trump’s administration is moving the U.S. closer to sparking a global trade war that could send the dollar plunging, in the eyes of at least one investor.
The risk that the U.S. pivots toward more protectionist policies is increasing with the departure of moderate voices, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, said Paresh Upadhyaya, a portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management, which oversees about $83 billion.
He estimates the chances of a U.S.-led trade war are as high as 30 percent, and he sees that outcome pushing the dollar about 12 percent weaker to $1.40 per euro within two years. If the U.S. inflames relations with its trading partners, particularly China, and other nations retaliate against American protectionism, investors will likely sell the greenback and seek shelter in the yen, Swiss franc and euro he said. Stocks also stand to suffer, he said.
“The dollar is the big loser,” the Boston-based money manager said in an interview. “The free marketers, the globalists, one by one, are leaving; the arguments are being won by the economic nationalists.”
It’s not just trade and politics that are weighing on the greenback. It’s fallen about 3 percent this year, extending a slide of almost 9 percent in 2017 that was fueled by the perception that other central banks would follow the Federal Reserve in withdrawing monetary stimulus.
Tillerson Trade
Traders sold the dollar and U.S. shares Tuesday on the news of Tillerson’s ouster, which followed Cohn’s last week after the president imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. In Wednesday trading, it was little changed at 106.30 yen and about $1.2360 per euro.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategists are looking past protectionism to broader reasons for dollar weakness, including an improving global economy and the prospect of tighter monetary policy outside the U.S. The firm says Trump’s tariffs still fall within the range of actions by previous presidents in the last 20 years, which didn’t spur trade wars.
However, U.S. politics appear to be driving investor sentiment. A gauge of U.S. political risk peaked this month in data going back to 2016, according to GeoQuant, an analytics firm in New York.
“Currency traders are bailing out of the dollar,” Karl Schamotta, director of global product and market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto, wrote in a note. “This confirms an extraordinary shift in psychology -- in the face of turmoil in the White House, the greenback appears to have lost its traditional safe-haven role, with the yen and euro acting as exit valves for fearful market participants.”

Data released on Wednesday showed that U.S. retail sales fell 0.1% in February. It was the third consecutive monthly decline, raising fears over a slowdown in growth in the first quarter.
At the same time, another report showed that U.S. producer prices rose slightly more than expected last month.
The reports came a day after data showing that U.S. consumer price inflation remained muted in February, cementing expectations that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise rates more than three times this year.
The Fed is to hold a two-day policy meeting starting next Tuesday and is widely expected to hike rates for the first time this year.

The dollar was little changed against the yen, with USD/JPY last at 106.52.
The yen had come under pressure since the start of the week amid a growing cronyism scandal linked to the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife involving the sale of public land.
The scandal raised concerns over Abe’s ability to continue pursuing his Abenomics policies, which include aggressive monetary easing.

“But we still need to see further evidence that inflation dynamics are moving in the right direction,” he added.
""When progress toward a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation is judged to be sufficient, net purchases will come to an end.""
Investors are on the lookout from clues to the ECB’s next policy move after the bank dropped a long standing pledge to increase asset purchases if needed from its rate statement last week.
Flagging a possible adjustment to forward guidance in the coming months, ECB Chief Economist Peter Praet said the bank will need to make its guidance more specific, as the current language will lose its effectiveness over time.
""With the passage of time, the indication that policy rates will remain at their present levels well past the end of net asset purchases will gradually cease to provide sufficient guidance about the likely evolution of the monetary policy stance,"" Praet said.
""So, our forward guidance on the path of our policy rates will have to be further specified and calibrated as appropriate for inflation to remain on the sustained adjustment path toward levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.""

The investment firm warned that while a March rate hike is priced into the market, further tightening of monetary policy would be difficult to justify should the pace of inflation fail to improve.
“At this point, a March rate hike is priced into the market as it has been since Chair Yellen’s press conference back in December of last year. But going forward, should inflation fail to ""move up"" as the Committee outlined in the January FOMC statement, a further removal of accommodation will be difficult to justify,” Stifel added.
USD/JPY gave back some of its gains after renewed political uncertainty in Washington stoked demand for safe-haven yen.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar jumped against the yen on Tuesday, nearing a two-week high as the Japanese currency was pressured by a political scandal engulfing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's govermment.
The yen weakened by 0.3 to 0.5 percent against other major currencies after Japan's ministry of finance said on Monday it altered documents related to a discounted sale of state-owned land to a school operator with ties to Abe's wife.
The dollar is also benefiting from the decline in broader currency market volatility which is encouraging investors to add positions in higher-yielding currencies, though the greenback's gains were capped before monthly U.S. inflation data.
""The broader story remains that of U.S. monetary policy normalization in the backdrop of an improving economy and a further decline in currency market volatility would only fuel more risk taking appetite,"" said Commerzbank's FX strategist Thu Lan Nguyen.
The dollar was trading at 106.95 against the yen , up 0.5 percent and just below a two-week high of 107.05.
The yen tends to suffer in an environment when riskier and higher-yielding assets are bid but  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists said in a note that a further deterioration in the political situation that affected the position of Abe, could see the yen ""forcefully return towards its previous upward trend.""
Elsewhere, though the renewed drop in currency volatility prompted investors to add bets on higher-yield currencies with the Australian dollar  recovering smartly from three-month lows while the euro gaining nearly 2 percent in the last 10 trading sessions. 
The euro (EUR=EBS) was broadly flat around $1.2329 against the dollar on the day.
A key focus for investors is the U.S. CPI data due at 1230 GMT. Median forecasts by economists polled by Reuters point to annual core CPI inflation  of 1.8 percent in February, which would be flat from January.
A higher reading could stoke expectations that the Federal Reserve will likely raise interest rates four times, rather than three times, this year.
A rate hike at its upcoming policy meeting on March 20-21 has been long considered a done deal while another increase in June is almost fully priced in.
Yet traders are also mindful that the prospects of more U.S. rate hikes, while theoretically positive for the dollar, may not necessarily lift the U.S. currency, given other factors weighing on the greenback.
One big issue is U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff on steel and aluminium, which many investors worry could trigger retaliatory moves by U.S. trade partners and hurt the economy.

""You know when it starts but not how it will turn out"" when countries engage in mutual retaliation, WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo said in remarks to reporters after a meeting with Brazilian President Michel Temer.
Brazil has said it will seek exemption from the newly imposed tariffs.
""This process of tit-for-tat can induce at times trade wars that are in no one's interests,"" Azevêdo said. He called for a multilateral approach rather than multiple bilateral actions.
Trump last week said he would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, sending countries scrambling to negotiate exemptions or consider retaliatory measures. Trump said that Canada and Mexico would be exempt from the tariffs.
The United States has been in prolonged negotiations with Canada and Mexico in efforts to revise the North American Free Trade agreement.
Azevêdo said Brazil was ""exploring alternatives"" for responding to the tariffs. Brazil, which is the second biggest supplier of steel to the United States after Canada, remains open for a dialogue to reach an understanding with the United States and is talking to other countries to learn about measures they are considering, he said.
Azevêdo said he did not know if Brazil would resort to the WTO’s dispute resolution mechanism but said Brazil was not ruling it out.

Earlier on Monday, Finance Minister Henrique Mereilles said Brazil's government had not made a decision yet on how to respond to the tariffs and needed to see what exactly the United States wanted in negotiations.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was at 89.94 by 04:54 AM ET (08:54 AM GMT), down 0.18% for the day.
The Labor Department reported Friday that the U.S. economy added 313,000 jobs last month, but average hourly earnings rose by just 0.1% in February.
The strong jobs growth boosted global risk appetite, while the slowdown in wage growth dampened expectations for four rate hikes by the Federal Reserve this year, a negative for the dollar, which tends to become more attractive to yield-seeking investors when borrowing costs rise.
The euro pushed higher, with EUR/USD rising 0.18% to 1.2329.
Gains in the single currency were held in check after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi downplayed a decision to drop the easing bias from last week’s rate statement and warned that increasing protectionism posed a threat to the outlook for growth in the euro area.
Sterling also gained ground against the greenback, with USD/GBP climbing 0.17% to 1.3877.
Against the yen, the dollar was lower, with USD/JPY down 0.24% to 106.54.

1467,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 09:03PM ET</span>",Trade Tussle to Highlight Asia Deficits as Currencies Weaken,"(Bloomberg) -- The current-account deficit is making a comeback as a reason to sell some Asian currencies, according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG.
U.S. President Donald Trump’s order to impose metal tariffs last week added to the pressure Asian exchange rates are facing this year from a hawkish Federal Reserve and rising Treasury yields. While a trade war is unlikely to break out, inflows into risk assets will be stymied, shining the spotlight on countries needing funds to narrow their deficits, said Trang Thuy Le, a macro-strategy analyst in Hong Kong.
“Deficit currencies such as Indonesia’s rupiah, India’s rupee and the Philippine peso are likely to be more vulnerable just because they need funding for their current-account deficits, and the environment is not supportive for portfolio flows,” said Trang. “India and Indonesia also have had large inflows into their respective markets recently so they are at risk of a reversal.”
India and Indonesia have recorded current-account deficits since 2005 and 2011, respectively, while the Philippines expects to post a third straight annual shortfall this year.
Since the U.S. Commerce Department recommended imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in mid-February, all but three of Asia’s currencies have weakened, with the rupiah’s slide of more than 1.5 percent the biggest among them. While Indonesia isn’t a notable exporter of those metals, its currency is often seen as a bellwether for how investors view the region given that foreigners own almost 40 percent of rupiah-denominated government debt.
Bank Indonesia has vowed to continue intervening to support the rupiah as the yield on 10-year notes surged to the highest since November last week. While jitters over a trade war eased after the U.S. agreed to exempt some countries from the metal tariffs, investors are still wary as China warned it would defend its interests.

The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies slipped 0.011% to 90.01 at 9:21pm ET. The dollar plunged last week to as low as 89.41 but rose again after signs of a global trade war initiated by U.S. president Trump’s tariff plan on imported steel and aluminum receded. Trump exempted North American partners Canada and Mexico from the tariffs and left the doors open for other allies to be exempted as well.
The news regarding a wider exemption for the tariffs added to discussions between the U.S. and North Korea of a potential high-level meeting between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, which boosted investors’ confidence in the greenback.
The dollar traded 0.18% lower against the yen at 106.60. The USD/JPY pair was trading around the 106 range in the morning Monday from the 105 last week on the back of a stronger dollar supported by improved market sentiment.
Meanwhile, the AUD/USD pair traded 0.36% lower at 0.7801. The Aussie got a lift from the news over the weekend that Australia would also be exempt from Trump’s tariff plan on imported steel and aluminum. Australia’s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull confirmed the news.
Elsewhere, The People’s Bank of China set the fix rate of yuan against the dollar at 6.3333 versus Friday’s 6.3451. The USD/CNY pair was quoted at 6.3276, up 0.29%.

1469,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 07:59AM ET</span>",Euro rally fades as risk appetite boosts higher-yielding FX,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro's rally on Monday fizzled as a more-dovish-than-expected central bank meeting last week continued to weigh on the single currency, while a revival in risk appetite hurt the dollar against higher-yielding currencies.
Strong U.S. jobs numbers and receding fears over a trade war helped a rebound in markets, and when markets have rallied this year the euro has tended to benefit against the dollar, as traders bet investors will continue to put more money into a region where the economies are booming. 
But the euro fell last week as the European Central Bank said inflation expectations remained subdued and that monetary policy would remain ""reactive"".
After initially rising to a session high of $1.2341 on Monday, the euro dropped 0.1 percent to $1.2297 (EUR=). The single currency, after a strong start to 2018, remains below the three-year peak hit in February of $1.2556.
""The euro is still suffering in the aftermath of the ECB meeting,"" said Alvin Tan, a currencies analyst at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN). ""The cross currents are affecting the euro.""
The dollar, which has tended to fall when risk appetite is rising, meanwhile reversed its falls to rise slightly. The greenback against a basket of currencies (DXY) rose 0.1 percent at 1130 GMT.
With little crucial economic data due in Europe, traders will focus on a meeting of the euro zone finance ministers on Monday for any comments on trade protectionism after President Donald Trump's decision to impose some tariffs.
Many analysts remain bullish on the euro.
""With the euro zone enjoying a massive 3.5 percent GDP current account surplus and the euro not particularly volatile, we suspect it will be very hard for (euro zone) finance officials to talk down the euro,"" said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING.
The strong U.S. job growth data released on Friday was counterbalanced by slower increases in wages, resulting in money market traders sticking to bets that the Fed would raise interest rates three times this year, with only around a one-in-four chance seen for a fourth rate hike in 2018.
Higher-yielding currencies like the Australian  and New Zealand  dollars also rose, 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent respectively. 
YEN GAINS
The yen, which tends to perform well when markets are anxious, gained as traders eyed a suspected Japan cronyism scandal involving the sale of state-owned land for its impact.
The name of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's wife was removed from documents regarding the issue, media said on Monday, as pressure mounted on the premier and his ally Finance Minister Taro Aso over a possible cover-up. 
Abe has denied that he or his wife did favors for a school operator and has said he would resign if evidence was found that they had. Aso has apologized for his ministry's actions over the documents but said that he had no intention of stepping down.
Market participants said the political developments in Japan helped temper gains in Japanese equities and lent some support to the yen.
The yen rose 0.2 percent to 106.58 yen , edging away from a one-week high of 107.05 yen set on Friday.

The dollar had risen against the yen last week as risk appetite improved on hopes for a breakthrough in the standoff over North Korea's nuclear weapons program, and reduced concern about an escalation in trade protectionism.

1470,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 11, 2018 09:30PM ET</span>",Hong Kong Sees Salvation From Asset Bubbles in Currency Weakness,"(Bloomberg) -- Normally, when a currency is falling, a simple step exists to revive it: raising interest rates. But in Hong Kong there are no interest rates to raise, and that’s created problems.
Hamstrung because it ceded monetary policy to the U.S. Federal Reserve 35 years ago, the Asian financial hub has had no choice but to watch as a decade of radical stimulus by a foreign central bank sent money coursing across its borders. The inflows have jacked up prices on everything from apartments to car park spaces.
The situation is on the verge of boiling over: Hong Kong’s dollar has weakened to a point where intervention is about to become obligatory. And to politicians and anyone else concerned about asset bubbles in the city, it couldn’t be happening at a better time.
“Why have home prices risen non-stop for 10 years? It’s not related to the economy. It’s a purely monetary phenomenon,” said Raymond Yeung, an economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Hong Kong. “If Hong Kong rates don’t rise, it’s hard for asset prices to correct.”
When the currency reaches the weak end of its band against the greenback, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will be compelled to buy Hong Kong dollars, thereby sucking up liquidity -- and finally lifting interbank rates that are lagging behind their U.S. equivalents. The widening rate discount is why the currency has been falling.
The HKMA pushed the Hong Kong dollar further in that direction on Thursday when it issued a statement ruling out issuing additional bills -- sales that previously have helped lift the exchange rate. The currency fell as much as 0.1 percent after the comments, its biggest decline since December. The Hong Kong dollar last traded at HK$7.8378, within 0.16 percent of the HK$7.85 level that marks the weak limit of the peg.
When the HKMA steps in to defend weak end of the band, the monetary base will shrink gradually, allowing local rates to normalize, said Norman Chan, head of the HKMA. One-month Hibor is more than 100 basis points below the U.S. equivalent of Libor, the biggest spread since 2008.
The market started pricing in expectations for higher rates after the HKMA’s statement. Twelve-month forward points surged the most since December 2016 that day, and one-year interest-rate swaps extended a nine-year high on Friday. The one-month interbank rate known as Hibor rose the most since Dec. 1.
With reserves of $443.5 billion, the HKMA is not short of ammunition. Once intervention begins, the pace can be sizable. Back in 2004, when rates were similarly lagging behind during a period of Fed hiking, the HKMA bought $4.1 billion worth of Hong Kong dollars over two months, helping drive the one-month Hibor up 86 basis points.
There’s plenty of cash to absorb. The city’s aggregate balance of interbank liquidity is still 100 times pre-crisis levels. It may also take a substantial increase in rates to knock the housing market off course. But the risks from a sustained period of easy monetary policy in a buoyant economy are mounting. In the Bank for International Settlements’ measure of the deviation of an economy’s credit-to-gross domestic product ratio from its long-term trend, Hong Kong came first in the world among 44 economies tracked, indicating unusually rapid debt growth in recent years.
“The HKMA is willing to take the risk to show the rest of the world the Hong Kong currency board can withstand depreciation pressure,” said ANZ’s Yeung. “We’ve seen inflows for many years, but very seldom do we see outflows.”

The slowdown in wage growth eased some concerns about the Federal Reserve hiking rates more quickly than expected this year.
Expectations for higher interest rates are typically negative for gold as the precious metal, which does not pay interest, struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets when rates rise.
The dollar had edged lower earlier in the week amid concerns over trade tensions, following President Donald Trump’s decision to impose heavy tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum into the U.S.
The currency regained ground in the following days after the White House said key U.S. trading partners Canada and Mexico would be exempt from the tariffs.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.13% to 90.12.
The U.S. economy created 313,000, well above the 239,000 jobs created in January, according to a report released Friday by the U.S. Department of Labor. That beat economists’ payrolls forecast of 200,000 .
The jobless rate remained unchanged at 4.1%, missing economists’ forecasts for a 0.1% decline to 4%.
Most of the attention, however, was focused on the average hourly earnings which grew just 0.1% in February, missing expectations for a 0.2% rise.
The dollar turned negative after moving sharply higher on the initial headline number of 313,000 new jobs, after traders cut their bullish bets on a fourth rate hike this year as many had expected wage growth to continue to rise at a faster pace after January’s strong reading.
""The wage numbers should allay fears of a quick pick up in inflation, and as such we still see the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates three times this year, the same pace as that seen in 2017,"" CIBC said.
That said, however, the data is expected to have little impact on the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision in two weeks, with many traders expecting the central bank to hike rates by 0.25%.

The dollar’s momentum was fuelled by reports that Kim Jong-un had pledged to suspend nuclear and missile testing, and that he would arrange a meeting with Trump by May, an unprecedented move that cooled down the tensions between the two countries. Trump has agreed to the meeting.
The dollar also got a lift from details of Trump’s tariff plan on imported steel and aluminum. Trump signed the plan that would be effective in 15 days but exempted Canada and Mexico and left the door open to exempt others.
The USD/JPY pair changed hands, trading 0.42% higher at 106.66. The chance of an easing in geopolitical concerns on the Korean peninsula prompted investors to sell the safe-haven yen and turned to the greenback.
The AUD/USD pair slid 0.09% to 0.7780. The Aussie declined on better-than-expected Chinese February CPI data that came in 2.9% y/y versus the expected 2.5%. China is Australia’s largest trading partner, and higher inflation in China could mean tighter lending conditions that affect Australia’s economy.
Elsewhere, the People’s bank of China set the fix rate of the yuan against the dollar at 6.3451 versus the previous rate of 6.3239. The USD/CNY traded at 6.3433, up 0.05%."
1479,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 10:36AM ET</span>","Dollar steady on mixed U.S. jobs data, yen falls after BOJ meeting","By Richard Leong
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar was firm against a basket of currencies on Friday as U.S. job growth recorded its best month in over 1-1/2 years in February while wage gains slowed more than expected, supporting the view the Federal Reserve would not quicken its pace on raising interest rates.
The yen fell broadly after the Bank of Japan stuck to its dovish policy stance. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, while sounding optimistic on growth, stressed there would be no plan to change monetary policy before its 2 percent inflation target is reached. 
Earlier Friday, the U.S. Labor Department said nonfarm payrolls grew by 313,000 last month, the largest monthly increase since July 2016, but average hourly earnings rose only 0.1 percent, slower than the 0.3 percent increase in January and less than the 0.2 percent forecast by analysts.
Traders concluded a tightening labor market would buttress the case for the Fed to raise key borrowing costs later this month and possibly two more times later this year, but the pullback in wage gains will likely prevent policymakers from raising rates four times in 2018.
""While this is good news for the U.S. economy, this doesn’t change anything with the Fed. The path of three rate hikes stays as our base case,"" said Chuck Tomes, senior trader at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.
The latest payrolls report may bolster the greenback in the short term, but global trade tension stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs, which he signed on Thursday and faster growth outside the United States remain a longer-term drag on the dollar, Tomes said.
At 10:01 a.m. ET (1501 GMT), the index that tracks the dollar against six major currencies (DXY) fell 0.139 points or 0.15 percent, to 90.04.
The euro (EUR=) was last up 0.11 percent at $1.2324.
The single currency remained on the back foot after falling on Thursday as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, while acknowledging faster growth in Europe, said regional inflation remained subdued and rising protectionism was a risk.

YEN SINKS
The dollar advanced to a one-week peak against the yen after the BOJ stuck to its negative rate policy on Friday and BOJ chief Kuroda, like Draghi, sounded caution about the risk of rising protectionism and inflation staying sluggish.
The yen also succumbed to traders scaling back their safe-haven holdings of the Japanese currency on news that Trump was prepared to meet with North Korea's Kim Jong Un, marking a potential major breakthrough in nuclear tensions with Pyongyang. 

The dollar  was last up 0.69 percent at 106.93 yen, while the euro was up 0.80 percent, at 131.81 yen.

1480,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 01:31PM ET</span>",Lessons From 1997 Show It's Scary Being a Hong Kong Dollar Bear,"(Bloomberg) -- As the Hong Kong dollar sinks toward the weak end of its trading band, it’s worth looking back to 1997 for lessons of how the authorities may respond. What was back then a currency peg has since been replaced by a band, but that will not alter the determination of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to defend it.
Although Hong Kong avoided the initial wave of currency attacks that began in July 1997 with the Thai baht’s devaluation, the city’s turn came in October. Excessive optimism in the Hang Seng Index quickly turned into panic selling and triggered a run on the currency. But the HKMA proved a brutal opponent for speculators to take on.
On the day that the fight reached a climax, overnight interest rates were allowed to climb to 300 percent as the HKMA held back from putting liquidity into the interbank market. This was enough to kill off the hedge fund attack as local banks could only raise funding for their own needs, so there were no Hong Kong dollars left to finance short sellers.
This time around it will be the first defense of the 7.85 level and the HKMA will need to rely on its currency reserves rather than a hard convertibility peg. Not that traders should expect any hesitation in the use of their full arsenal, worth more than $400 billion. And it’ll be combined with timely verbal intervention to remind investors that officials are on alert and fully engaged. Then there is China to consider.
Hong Kong’s money is Beijing’s money and the chance that Xi Jinping will sanction a devaluation of the Hong Kong dollar is very low. Currency swaps between central banks in Asia are being widely used, thus a line from the PBOC to backstop the HKMA would be completely normal. Access to China’s currency reserve pile is a very big stick to swing, even against today’s multi trillion dollar FX market.
The question for Hong Kong dollar speculators in 2018 is one that Clint Eastwood once used in a movie. So do you feel lucky?

EUR/USD was at 1.2392 by 09:13 AM ET (14:13 GMT) after initially rising to a high of 1.2446.
The euro initially rose after the ECB dropped a pledge to extend its stimulus program if necessary from its rate statement, in a sign that it is moving closer to ending its massive monetary stimulus program.
Draghi said the pledge to expand its quantitative easing program had been added to the bank’s rate statement in 2016 when the situation was very different.
The decision to drop the easing bias on QE was unanimous, Draghi said.
He also noted that the ECB maintained its pledge to continue its asset purchase program until September 2018 ‘or beyond, if necessary’.
The ECB revised up its growth forecasts for 2018 to 2.4% from 2.3% in December and left its growth forecast for 2019 and 2020 unchanged at 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively.
Draghi cautioned that growth could be threatened by various downside risks, including protectionism.
The central bank revised down its inflation forecasts for 2019 to 1.4% from 1.5% previously. It still expects inflation of 1.4% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2020.

U.S. President Donald Trump was expected to give more details later Thursday on his plans to impose tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports in a recommitment to his nationalist trade agenda.
Sentiment waned after Trump's economic adviser Gary Cohn announced his resignation on Tuesday. The decision was said to have been made following a disgreement between Cohn and the U.S. President over the import tariffs.
Traders fear that the proposed tariffs could spark inflation and provoke retaliation from U.S. trade partners. Major holders of U.S. Treasuries, including China and the European Union, could reduce their holdings of U.S. assets in response.
The White House said late Wednesday that Canada, Mexico and possibly other countries may be exempted at least for a while from the proposed tariffs.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar recovered ground on Thursday, drawing relief from positive labor market data and the White House saying Canada and Mexico, and possibly other countries, may be exempted from planned U.S. import tariffs on steel and aluminum.
Elsewhere on the currency markets, the euro trod water ahead of a European Central Bank meeting, later in the day, that is expected to leave policy rates unchanged for now, but may provide clues to the future.
The dollar had weakened sharply following the resignation on Tuesday of Gary Cohn, the top economic advisor to the White House who was seen as seen as a bulwark against protectionism in President Donald Trump's administration.
His departure had fanned fears of a potential global trade war if Trump pressed ahead with proposals for tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminum.
Broader financial markets grew calmer, with Wall Street paring losses overnight, after the White House raised the possibility of exemptions. Some dealers have bet on the possibility that the tariff threat was a negotiating ploy in trade talks with neighbors.
Trump plans to offer Canada and Mexico a 30-day exemption from planned tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which could be extended based on progress in talks on amending the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a White House official said on Wednesday night.
The dollar's recovery was stoked by Wednesday's data on U.S. private hiring and labor costs that reinforced the view of underlying strength in the economy. 
The U.S. currency was steady at 106.040 yen  after slipping to as low as 105.450 the previous day in reaction to Cohn's departure.

""That said, 'Trump risk,' which are developments associated with the U.S. president and his circle, will continue to impact the market as one of the main themes of 2018.""
While worries about U.S. tariffs may have eased somewhat, the dollar's recovery was limited as fears of trade conflicts lingered with Trump seen sticking to a protectionist stance in the longer run.
Daisuke Karakama, chief market economist at Mizuho Bank in Tokyo, said that while the currency market is difficult to predict, the dollar ""will almost certainly weaken"" if that's what the United States wants to happen.
""Along with tariffs, weakening your own currency becomes a weapon in a trade war,"" he said.

Focus for the common currency was on the ECB's policy decision at 1245 GMT. The central bank is all but certain to keep policy unchanged but may tweak its communication stance to offer at least a few clues about its progress toward ending its unprecedented bond purchases later this year.
""Under normal circumstances the ECB decision would not be a risk event as the central bank is expected to stand pat on policy. But the ECB's stance will be watched carefully in the wake of political confusion in the United States,"" Ishikawa at IG Securities said.
The Canadian dollar was 0.2 percent firmer at C$1.2881  per dollar, having weakened to C$1.3002 on Wednesday but recovering on the prospect that Trump's tariffs may exempt Canada and Mexico.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar’s nosedive over the last year - only exacerbated by the recent threat of trade wars - is rekindling concerns that the greenback’s standing as the premier global reserve currency is at risk, but data compiled by Reuters suggests such fears are overblown.
Moreover, any real threat to its pre-eminent position would take years to materialize given its commanding share of global reserves and a relative paucity of alternatives.
The U.S. dollar index (DXY) fell 10 percent against a basket of currencies last year, its steepest drop since 2003, on evidence Europe, China and other nations are growing faster than the United States even as the Federal Reserve raised rates three times. 
So far this year, it is down nearly 3 percent amid worries about trade tension and foreign central banks' dialing back of stimulus. It hit a three-plus year low in February.
The greenback weakened since late last week after U.S. President Donald Trump's surprise announcement to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, stoking fears of an all-out global trade war.
""This administration is not global-trade friendly,"" said Sireen Harajli, currency strategist at Mizuho in New York. Trump's protectionist stance may have a short-term negative impact on the dollar but it may not be an enduring one, she added.
Any real threat to the dollar's pre-eminent position would take years to materialize given its commanding share of global reserves and a relative paucity of alternatives.
""I would not worry (about) the status of the dollar as the top reserve currency in the next 20 years,"" said Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global in Philadelphia.
The dollar’s status as the global reserve currency has been called into question since the 1980s with the introduction of the euro and China's dramatic economic ascent.
The greenback has come under additional pressure in recent months in the wake the Trump administration's contradictory views on trade.
Back in January, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at the World Economic Forum in Davos said, ""Obviously a weaker dollar is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities."" A day later, Trump said he favored a ""strong dollar."" 
""I get a sense the dollar is getting increasingly punished for the unpredictability of this administration's policy-making,"" said Omer Eisner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. ""That is a big question for investors despite the favorable (economic) backdrop.""
But is such a fear justified?

YELLOW CARDS
There are warning signs: China and Japan, the two largest U.S. creditors, have cooled on owning U.S. government bonds.
China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange said it has been diversifying its foreign exchange investments. That’s coming just as Uncle Sam is looking to borrow more to finance a growing deficit from a major tax cut and the Federal Reserve is shrinking its balance. 
Moreover, the share of allocated reserves that foreign governments hold in dollars as reported to the IMF has been declining in recent quarters, and  the Fed’s custody holdings for overseas central banks have been falling.
Last month, China's FX reserves, the world's biggest, fell for the first time in 13 months to $3.134 trillion, retreating from the highest level since September 2016 reached in January. Its holding of U.S. Treasuries, in the meantime, has stalled after reaching $1.2 trillion back in August.
Japan, the second largest owner of U.S. government bonds, said its currency reserves edged up to $1.269 trillion in January, while its Treasuries holdings fell to $1.062 trillion, the lowest since December 2011. 
While total FX reserves have grown, dollar's share of them fell for a third consecutive quarter in the fall of 2017 to 63.5 percent, its smallest since mid-2014, while the euro's and sterling's shares of reserves edge higher, according to data from the International Monetary Fund released in December. 
""It's more palatable for central banks to move into euro and sterling,"" due to their relatively high liquidity, said Paresh Upadhyaya, director of currency at Amundi Pioneer Investments in Boston.
(Graphic - U.S. Treasuries top foreign holders click http://reut.rs/2DjHnk0) 
TOO EARLY TO TELL
While the dollar's decline could persist in the foreseeable future, analysts say, its reserve currency status will not likely be in danger unless there are signs of overseas governments dumping Treasuries, a drop in dollar-denominated currency trades, and the dollar index breaking below its all-time low in 2009. 
Allocated dollar reserves, reported to the IMF, rose to $6.126 trillion in the third quarter of 2017 from $5.912 trillion the prior quarter. 
Average daily FX trading volume in North America last October, a proxy of dollar-based transaction, grew by 7 percent from a year earlier, the New York Federal Reserve's Foreign Exchange Committee's semi-annual survey released in January showed.
All in all, the greenback, while it has lost luster since early 2017, is not in danger of being unseated as the world's top reserve currency anytime soon.

""I don't believe the dollar is reverting to a structural decline,"" Amundi Pioneer's Upadhyaya said. (For a graphic of the Dollar Index v Euro click http://reut.rs/2BHqgH1)

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.08% to 89.63. The dollar had traded bounced from a session low of 89.36.
Private payrolls grew by 235,000 in February, according to a report released Wednesday by ADP and Moody's Analytics. That beat economists’ forecast of 195,000, and raised investor expectations for a bullish nonfarm payrolls print due Friday as ADP data often serves as precursor to nonfarm payrolls.
Hedge Fund Economics said it expects an above-consensus nonfarm payrolls reading of 230,000 in total.
The solid ADP print helped the dollar claw back some of its losses against the yen as USD/JPY traded at Y105.85, down 0.27%, but well off the lows of Y105.46. The yen had rallied sharply against the dollar earlier in the day on safe-demand after U.S. economic advisor Gary Cohn resigned from the Trump administration.
Also helping the greenback was a slump in the Canadian dollar after the Bank of Canada left rates unchanged and struck a dovish tone in it’s monetary policy statement.
“Cooling growth left little reason for Bank of Canada to rush another rate hike,” CIBC said.
CIBC added that the monetary policy statement highlighted that trade policy developments were a growing source of uncertainty, clouding the outlook for the economy and building on what has been a disappointing run in export growth. The bank maintained its call that the Bank of Canada will hike interest rates only once more in 2018.
USD/CAD rose 0.83% to C$1.2984.
EUR/USD fell 0.04% to $1.2399 ahead of the European Central Bank meeting Thursday, when the central bank is expected to stand pat on interest rates.
Investor focus, however, is likely to centre on comments from ECB governor Mario Draghi amid expectations that he may hint at plans to rein in accommodative monetary policy measures.

1490,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",Canadian dollar forecast to overcome trade worries and strengthen: Reuters poll,"By Fergal Smith
TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar is forecast to rally over the coming year, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday, as global economic strength and a broadly weaker greenback offsets smoldering investor fears of a trade war that could damage Canada's economy.
The poll of nearly 50 foreign exchange strategists taken March 1-6 predicted that the loonie will climb to C$1.2700 to the greenback, or 78.74 U.S. cents, in one month, from around C$1.2875 on Tuesday. It is then expected to climb in a year to C$1.2300, matching the forecast from last month's poll.
The Canadian dollar has bumped around in recent weeks on developments from North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) talks between the U.S., Canada and Mexico, which the Trump administration last year said required renegotiation.
So far currency strategists and traders have opted to look on the bright side. 
""Given an ongoing renegotiation of NAFTA and a lack of U.S. withdrawal we think there are pretty good conditions for sustained loonie strength,"" said Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Canada and Monex Europe.
Conditions supportive of the Canadian dollar include strong global and domestic growth and interest rate hikes from the Bank of Canada, Berich said.
The central bank has raised interest rates three times since July. A separate Reuters poll forecasts the benchmark rate to be left on hold at 1.25 percent on Wednesday but for rates to be raised two more times by the end of the year. 
In the meantime, strong global growth could help raise demand for the commodities that Canada produces, including oil, metals and lumber. The U.S. dollar is also forecast to remain on a relentless downward path. 
""All of those commodities are denominated in U.S. dollars,"" said Eric Theoret, a currency strategist at Scotiabank. ""An environment of U.S. dollar weakness is supportive of commodities broadly.""
The greenback fell last month to a three-year low against a basket of major currencies, while the price of U.S. crude oil has rebounded as much as 156 percent from its February 2016 trough around $26 a barrel.
Still, the potential collapse of NAFTA or a global trade war could hurt Canada's economy. Donald Trump's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, quit on Tuesday, giving free trade skeptics the upper hand in the White House.
On Monday, the loonie touched an eight-month low at C$1.3002 after Trump appeared to tie possible exemptions for Canada and Mexico from proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum to a ""new"" NAFTA as well as other steps.
Canada is the largest supplier of both metals to the United States. It sends 75 percent of its exports to the United States.
""Of primary concern to us is uncertainty around the trade and investment climate leading to a shortfall of capital flow into Canada,"" said Ben Randol, senior FX strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).

1493,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 02:51AM ET</span>","CEE currencies to firm on growth, interest rate outlook: Reuters poll","By Sandor Peto
BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Central Europe's main currencies are expected to strengthen in the next 12 months on the back of healthy economic growth and expectations for monetary tightening, a Reuters poll of analysts showed in Wednesday.
According to the March 2-6 poll, the Czech crown (EURCZK=) will gain 2.3 percent against the euro in the next 12 months relative to Monday's close, to 24.85, which would be its strongest level since 2012.
Its strengthening is fueled by expectations that the Czech central bank will continue to increase interest rates to fight inflation, analysts said.
The forint (EURHUF=) is expected to firm 2.2 percent to 307.5 by the end of February next year, and the zloty (EURPLN=) 1.2 percent to 4.14.
In past weeks, the Polish and the Hungarian units traded near their weakest levels this year as global markets were gripped by risk aversion due to inflation fears, before a rebound this week.
Unlike its Czech peer, the Polish central bank has not been worried over inflation.
It is expected to keep interest rates on hold at its meeting on Wednesday, and its updated economic forecasts are seen confirming that robust growth is coupled with moderate inflation.
""The... meeting should thus have little impact on the zloty,"" Erste analysts said in a note, adding though that ""the recent acceleration of wage growth should turn into demand pressure sooner or later, pushing the inflation rate up slightly in mid-2018"".
The bank is expected to start to lift rates next year.
The Hungarian central bank (NBH) could keep its main rate on hold for years, but may start to withdraw the surplus liquidity it has injected into markets through its swap facilities already later this year, said David Nemeth, analyst at K&H Bank.
Nemeth said the risk was a decline in Hungary's big trade surplus, which buoys the forint, as wages and household consumption surge across the region, adding though that a strong inflow of European Union funds this year help the forint.
Peter Virovacz of ING, who sees the forint approaching 300 versus the euro by February next year, said Hungary's current account could surprise on the positive side as new production capacities step in later this year in the key automotive sector.
""The ECB could start to tighten policy next year, so the NBH is unlikely to ease its own policy further,"" he said, adding that a forint firming would not bother the bank as long as Hungary's government bond spreads over core markets do not rise.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's rand is expected to weaken more than 4 percent in 12 months as investors start to take profits from the over-bought currency on doubts of how much new President Cyril Ramaphosa can achieve in reforms.
A Reuters poll taken March 1-6 published on Wednesday showed the rand  is expected to trade at 12.25 per dollar in a year, down from around 11.74 presently.
Markets have rallied since Ramaphosa was elected by parliament as South Africa's president last month since Jacob Zuma resigned on orders from the ruling African National Congress. But he faces an uphill battle in revitalizing growth and creating jobs. 
""We see any rallies in the rand being met by profit taking and scepticism that President Ramaphosa can transform the economy,"" said Christopher Shiells, emerging market strategist at Informa Global Markets.
The latest monthly Reuters poll of 34 currency strategists was taken before news that South Africa's economy expanded by 3.1 percent in the final quarter of last year, more than forecast and easily ahead of 2.3 percent in the prior quarter.
A Reuters poll last month said South Africa's economy is expected to grow 1.4 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year, suggesting those forecasts may already need to be revised higher. [ECILT/ZA]
""Ramaphosa has his work cut out for him - and his key objective should of course be to reduce constraints on GDP growth,"" Shiells said.
South Africa has also benefited from an unusually synchronized global economic expansion, but some analysts say they fear this could be damaged by a proposal from U.S. President Donald Trump to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
""If full-scale trade wars unfold and commodity prices fall, the rand would struggle to hold onto its impressive gains,"" said Piotr Matys, emerging markets strategist at Rabobank. 
Moody's is due to publish a review later this month, which economists said in February would offer the country a reprieve.
South Africa will announce details of wide-ranging reforms at state-owned firms within four weeks, the public enterprises minister said on Tuesday, as government seeks to return credibility to companies hobbled by graft and mismanagement.

The US dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies slipped 0.09% to 89.48 at 10:30pm ET. The dollar turned bearish since US President Trump’s tough tariff plan last week and the decline extended to this week, with no sign of picking up.
Gary Cohn, Trump's top economic advisor, is leaving the Trump administration due to disputes over the president's tariff plan. The White House also said it was considering to impose wider curbs on China and clamp down on Chinese investments in the US. Investors suspected Trump’s protectionism may result in a weaker dollar that stimulates exports and high tariffs that curb imports. Fears of a global trade war revived following Cohn’s resignation.
The softer dollar supported the appreciation of the yen, with the USD/JPY pair sliding 0.44% to 105.67. The safe-haven currency gained grounds as signals were mixed whether Trump would translate his tariff plans into policy. Eyes will be on Japan’s Q4 GDP data that are due tomorrow morning.
The AUD/USD pair traded 0.36% lower at 0.7801. The Aussie remained soft on Reserve Bank of Australia’s dovish monetary policy that is holding the rates well into 2019. Australia’s GDP growth of the fourth quarter in 2017 missed forecast of 0.5% quarter-on-quarter to come at 0.4% instead.

China’s National People’s Congress continued to remain in focus, as the country’s finance minister Xiao Jie said on the third day of the event that the country would continue to cut tax and pledge tax cut of $126 billion, on top of extending tax breaks to small and medium sized enterprises. Xiao also noted that China would strictly punish debt issuance chaos to ensure there is no systematic debt risks in the country.

Elsewhere, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.7% after the country reported a slower-than-expected GDP growth of 0.4% in the December quarter, compared to the general consensus of an increase of 0.5%. The economic growth was reportedly undermined by weaker construction and exports.

1497,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 07:21PM ET</span>",Dollar still losing battle with euro despite Fed outlook,"By Rahul Karunakar and Hari Kishan
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar will retreat further over the coming year, giving way to an ascendant euro, according to a Reuters poll of strategists who said five or more Federal Reserve rate rises would be needed to significantly boost the greenback's fortunes.
After losing 10 percent in 2017, the dollar had its best monthly run in February since November 2016 in part as solid economic data fanned expectations the U.S. central bank would raise interest rates four times this year rather than three.
But the dollar is down about 2 percent so far in 2018 and is forecast to weaken further this year, leaving the euro (EUR=) at $1.28, up from around $1.24 on Tuesday, according to the March 1-6 poll of over 60 foreign exchange strategists.
Stocks, bonds and currency markets have been whipsawed over the past month on rising volatility, concerns that inflation will rise, and government borrowing will surge on the U.S. administration's tax cuts and new increased spending plans.
Reuters polls of economists, equity strategists and analysts taken over the past few weeks have all suggested the U.S. government was wrong to cut taxes at this stage of the business cycle. [EPOLL/WRAP] [ECILT/US]
""The U.S. fiscal decisions imply that the U.S. needs to find more foreign investors, and we expect the U.S. to face stronger competition than in the past when marketing a rising debt inventory to foreign investors,"" noted Thomas Flury, global head of currency strategy at UBS Group AG.
""The consequence is likely to be a falling U.S. dollar."" 
Twenty-seven of 57 strategists in the latest poll said the change in the U.S. fiscal position has driven their view for a weaker dollar now. Eighteen said there was no change in their outlook and the remaining 12 respondents said the dollar will strengthen from it.
""That (fiscal stimulus) is something which will weigh on the dollar going forward,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at MUFG. ""The budget deficit and the current account deficit are both likely to widen out in the coming years and certainly start to reach levels which could be seen as more dollar-negative in the medium- to long-term.""
While rising U.S. Treasury yields pushed the dollar to a six-week high last week, the currency pulled back sharply after President Donald Trump's decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum sparked fears of an imminent trade war.
Currency speculators increased their bets against the greenback to a three-week high, according to data from Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday.
""The fiscal impact on the U.S. cycle will be front-loaded in terms of growth, thus we believe the USD should receive some short-term support. But the trade policies could have the opposite impact in the short-term,"" noted Roberto Cobo Garcia, FX strategist at BBVA (MC:BBVA).
""Thus, we maintain our expectations that the USD has limited upside potential and that risks remain tilted to the downside.""
The dollar is expected to gain significantly only if five or more Fed rate hikes are priced in, according to over 70 percent of 54 respondents who answered an additional question. The remaining 17 strategists said four would be enough.
""Given the hawkish tone of the new Fed chairman (Jerome) Powell before Congress, we would need to see more than four rate hikes coupled with a steepening in the Treasury yield curve for the USD to appreciate significantly,"" added BBVA's Garcia.
Interest rate futures markets are currently pricing in a roughly one-in-four chance of a fourth Fed hike this year.
The dollar has also lost ground as several major central banks now appear to be moving roughly in the same direction towards policy tightening, albeit at differing speeds, closing the interest rate gap with the United States.
Robust economic growth in the euro zone has driven expectations for the European Central Bank to end its over 2.5 trillion euro asset purchase program by end-year. That pushed the euro along its best rally since 2003 last year. 
But the ECB is not expected to raise rates until next year at the earliest, and inflation, at least in the last few months, is moving away from the central bank's target.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar fell more than half a percent against the Japanese yen on Wednesday as the departure of a top economic adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump raised concerns that tensions over a global trade war were entering a new heightened phase.
Market watchers said the departure of economic adviser Gary Cohn, a former Wall Street banker, would embolden protectionist forces in the U.S. administration as Trump seeks to impose hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum.
The greenback held just above a 14-month low against the yen  as investors took shelter in the low-yielding currency on concerns the outbreak of a trade war would derail global growth at a time when U.S. deficit is seen expanding sharply on Trump's fiscal stimulus plans.
""The cleanest way to trade the risk aversion and the trade war theme is to be short dollar/yen but it is tricky if risk aversion dominates and that could fuel a safe-haven bid at some point of time for the dollar as well,"" said Elsa Lignos, global head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets based in London.
The dollar tumbled 0.6 percent to 105.45 yen  its lowest since Monday and within touching distance of a 14-month low of 105.24 hit last Friday. 
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar (DXY) was a shade lower at 89.53.
Cohn's departure comes against the backdrop of a series of steps by the Trump administration to assert protectionist policies, including withdrawing the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, instigating a renegotiation of NAFTA and imposing hefty import tariffs on some targeted products. 
""The voices of reason in the White House are dwindling and the risk of a trade war is increasing,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) strategists wrote in a daily note.

Some investors such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said policymakers may remove an easing bias from its policy statement as early as a policy meeting on Thursday and likely upgrade its growth and inflation forecasts.

1505,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 07:31PM ET</span>",Asia's Biggest Currency Gain in 20 Years May Be About to End,"(Bloomberg) -- Asian currencies may be on the verge of a correction after completing the best year in at least two decades. The warning sign? Indonesia’s rupiah slumped to a two-year low last week.
The rupiah is seen as a bellwether of sorts for Asia given the high foreign ownership of Indonesia’s bonds and its largely open economy. The currency is typically among the first in the region to be sold when sentiment sours, and this often heralds a broader decline among its peers.
The rupiah has tumbled 1.5 percent in the past month, the worst performer in Asia and third-worst among 24 emerging-market currencies worldwide. It fell as overseas investors sold the nation’s stocks and bonds and equity volatility jumped due to expectations of higher U.S. interest rates.
“Indonesia’s rupiah is arguably the high-beta version of Asian ex-Japan risks,” said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “The declines are certainly not peculiar to IDR. Nor are they conclusively behind us. The upshot is that with uncertainty around global trade risks, global liquidity is set to start declining, albeit gently, later this year. AXJ air-pockets are anticipated.”
The Bloomberg JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asia Dollar Index, which measures 10 of the region’s currencies against the greenback, climbed 6.7 percent last year, the biggest annual advance in data that started in 1994. If the rupiah proves to be the canary in the coal mine, the gauge may give back a lot of those gains this year.
Dollar Revival
Regional currencies may suffer due to a resurgent dollar. The greenback has rallied since new Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell delivered upbeat testimony to lawmakers last week. His acknowledgment of stronger U.S. economic growth fueled speculation the central bank may raise interest rates as many as four times this year.
Global funds pulled $1.02 billion from Indonesian bonds last week, the biggest five-day outflow since November 2016, according to central bank data. They sold $186 million of the nation’s equities in the same period.
There are signs other Asian currencies are also starting to weaken, with the Philippine peso dropping to the weakest since July 2006 last month.
Declines in the rupiah have often foreshadowed losses among Asian peers. In January 2016, the Asia Dollar Index slumped to a seven-year low, months after the rupiah sank to the weakest since 1998.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar slipped to a one-week low on Tuesday against a basket of currencies as traders piled back into riskier currencies after an agreement between North and South Korea to hold direct talks.
The dollar had already been weakening on worries about a trade war due to U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs last week on imported steel and aluminum.
The U.S. currency, seen as a safe-haven against risk in recent months, fell further after news of the North and South Korea talks as investors bought the Australian and New Zealand dollars and emerging market currencies.
""It's too early to wholeheartedly buy these currencies because of the chances of escalating trade tension between U.S. and its trading partners,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
North and South Korea, still technically at war but enjoying easing tension since the Winter Olympics in the South last month, will hold their first summit in more than a decade next month, South Korea said on Tuesday.
It also said North Korea is willing to hold talks with the United States on denuclearization and will suspend nuclear tests while those talks are under way.
This offset worries about Trump's proposed levies, which has prompted protests from Europe, Canada and other countries. 
At 11:09 a.m. (1609 GMT), the dollar fell 0.557 points or 0.62 percent, against a group of currencies (DXY) to 89.523.
It also touched its weakest level against the South Korean won  since Jan. 25. It was last down 1.38 percent, at 1,061.81 won.
Among higher-yielding currencies, the New Zealand dollar was up as much as 1.2 percent on the day  and the Aussie up more than 1 percent.
Against the yen - traditionally seen as a safe haven - the dollar had slipped as low as 105.86 yen , not far from the 16-month low it reached late last week after Trump said he would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum. The yen was last down 0.21 percent, at 105.97 yen. 
The euro (EUR=) rebounded to a two-week high of $1.2414 on Tuesday after a selloff on Monday following elections in Italy and Germany.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro edged higher on Monday after a short-lived sell-off tied to Italy's inconclusive weekend election, helped by the creation of a coalition government in Germany that eased political uncertainty there.
Italy's election, which pointed to prolonged political jitters after right-wing and eurosceptic parties did better than expected, was somewhat balanced by Germany's Social Democrats agreeing to join with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, ending a period of uncertainty in Europe's biggest economy.
Taken together, the election outcomes did not to alter investors' view on the strength of the euro zone economy, although the Italian results put political risks in the region back on the radar.
""All in all, they are neutral to slightly positive for the euro,"" said Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in New York.
Bennenbroek and other analysts said traders will turn their focus to four major central bank meetings this week as well as the U.S. payrolls report due Friday.
The Reserve Bank of Australia will meet on Tuesday, while the Bank of Canada will hold a policy meeting on Wednesday. European Central Bank policymakers will convene on Thursday, while their counterparts at the Bank of Japan will meet on Friday.
The euro (EUR=) was last up 0.09 percent to $1.2328. 
The single currency rose to a two-week high at $1.2365 in Asian trading after the German results. It quickly retreated by 0.8 percent toward the day's low at $1.2267 as results from Italy pointed to a messier outcome than expected - a strong showing for anti-establishment parties and no group able to form a stable government.

1514,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",U.S. dollar outlook darkens as trade war looms,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar could face headwinds if President Donald Trump's proposals to impose stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are enacted, with the biggest risk stemming from the possible flight of capital flows needed to finance ballooning U.S. deficits.
Currency markets, in general, dislike any form of trade intervention and previous protectionist efforts by the U.S. government have resulted in dollar weakness. 
""The U.S. is now in a very precarious position because it's putting a risk premium on U.S. assets by introducing tariffs and going down this protectionist route, which is negative for growth,"" said Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC), head of North American FX strategy at TD Securities in Toronto.
The introduction of import tariffs threatens to increase the price of foreign products in the United States, reducing demand and imports. 
Tariffs introduced by Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton in 2002 and 1995 had resulted in a 15 percent decline in the dollar overall, according to estimates from TD Securities, although there were other factors that also undermined the U.S. currency during those periods.
The biggest risk for the dollar stems from the possible exodus of capital flows, analysts said. If risk sentiment worsens significantly, this would outweigh any short-term advantage the dollar would have against emerging markets in its role as a safe-haven bet, they said.
Trump said on Thursday duties of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum would be formally announced next week, although White House officials later said some details still needed to be ironed out.
The dollar fell against most currencies after the announcement, falling to a more than two-year low versus the yen.
Trump's comments have already caused an uproar in the international community, provoking a reaction from Canada, whose foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland said the country ""will take responsive measures to defend its trade interests and workers."" 
Other countries such were already looking at how to respond. Europe has drawn up a list of U.S. products on which to apply tariffs if Trump follows through on his plan 
Analysts, meanwhile, are monitoring how China would react. China, while currently accounting for only a minor share of U.S. steel imports due to existing trade barriers, is by far the world's largest producer. 
Retaliation by other countries could prompt the withdrawal of capital flows from the United States at a time when the country has to finance its burgeoning twin deficits, analysts said.
The capital flow dynamic has changed over the last five to six years and countries such as China, Japan, and Europe have turned net creditors, pushing money overseas in search of the best-yielding asset. 
On the other hand, the United States, while still the largest economy in the world, has become a net debtor, with current account and fiscal deficits seen exceeding more than 8 percent of gross domestic product over the next two years, analysts said.
Part of the expansion in the U.S. budget shortfall is attributed to the Trump administration's tax overhaul and fiscal stimulus. 
To bridge those deficits, the United States needs to borrow from overseas. Analysts said about 60 percent of U.S. deficits are funded by foreign countries or entities. 
""The countries you're basically having a trade war with -- you're basically poking China and Europe -- are the countries that you will be relying on to finance your deficit,"" said McCormick.
NEGATIVE FOR GROWTH 
In addition, any impact on U.S. growth - though this is expected to be limited - could undercut the dollar, analysts said.
Andrew Hunter, U.S. economist at Capital Economics in London, said while the direct effect of tariffs may be minimal because steel and aluminum products account for just over 2 percent of overall imports, the ""knock-on impact"" on industries that use these products would be greater.
He added that domestic U.S. steel prices have already risen by 20 percent since the start the year in anticipation of protectionist measures and this could be a significant drag on steel consumers like the machinery, motor vehicle and construction industries.
""The Fed will presumably look through the temporary impact on inflation from higher imported steel prices, but it will find it harder to ignore any resulting upward pressure on wages and prices stemming from the increased demand among domestic (steel and aluminum) producers,"" said Hunter. 
This may yet be another reason to expect the Fed to raise interest rates four times this year. But some analysts said this may not necessarily boost the dollar since this outlook for interest rates is being driven not by expectations of stronger growth, but by fears of fiscal and political instability and inflation spiraling out of control.

1517,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 03:31PM ET</span>",Yen Emerging as Currency-Market Winner as Trade Tensions Mount,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump is touting the virtues of a trade war. In the $5.1 trillion-a-day currency market, the yen has emerged as a clear winner from the escalating rhetoric.
The latest move pushes forward the administration’s trade agenda, after it took similar actions on other goods this year and jawboned the dollar lower. The potential hit to U.S. and global growth from protectionism has sent stocks lower, initially drove bonds higher and buoyed the yen. Investors and strategists are wagering there’s more of the same to come.
The unfolding events remind Chris Turner, global head of currency strategy at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV, of the early 1990s when the U.S. took protectionist steps against Japan.
“We might now have people dusting off their forecasts for the dollar-yen to reach 80 in 2019,” said Turner, whose forecast stands at 100 for now. “Investors may be front-running potential shifts in portfolio capital into 2019 and be saying today it’s worth increasing hedge ratios, and the best currency to do that is long yen.”
The yen surged to a then-record high in 1995 of 79.75 per dollar. The currency has long been seen as a haven during times of turmoil in part because the nation’s high savings rate has traditionally allowed Japan to be less dependent on outside sources of funding during trade and political disputes.
The tariffs could reduce U.S. growth by as much as 0.2 percentage point this year, and further risk lies in how trading partners respond,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc economists said.
The greenback slid Friday as traders sought refuge in the yen, Swiss franc and euro. Trade-sensitive currencies, such as the Canadian dollar, also fell.
Policy Boost
The yen also got a boost Friday after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the central bank will start thinking about how to exit its unprecedented easing around fiscal year 2019. The exchange rate is now 105.48, with the yen appreciating 1.3 percent since the end of last week.
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is down about 2.5 percent this year, adding to its 9 percent plunge in 2017.
At the World Economic Forum meeting in January in Davos, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin endorsed the dollar’s recent decline as a benefit to the American economy. Though he later tried to clarify those comments, investors have interpreted the remarks as a green light to sell the dollar.
Richard Benson, a managing director and head of portfolio investments at London-based Millennium Global Investments, also says classic havens besides the greenback stand to benefit.
Growth Risk
“It’s a negative for global growth,” said Benson, whose firm manages $14 billion. “This is broadly dollar-negative but it’s also not an emerging-market positive.”
Benson is long the euro versus the dollar and the pound, and is wagering against growth-oriented currencies in Asia, including the Australian dollar and China’s yuan.
Historians blame a trade war during the Great Depression, starting with the U.S. passage of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, for deepening the worldwide economic slump.
George Saravelos, global co-head of foreign-exchange research at  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) in London, said Trump’s tariffs represent a shift from tough rhetoric to action.
“This is a ‘soft dollar’ policy by proxy,” Saravelos wrote in a note. “Tariffs are a negative supply shock that increase inflation but lower growth, a bad mix for a currency,” said Saravelos, who’s bearish on the greenback."
1518,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 01:41PM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar Slides Amid Fears Over Global Trade War ,"Investing.com – The dollar fell against a major basket of currencies as President Donald Trump’s proposal to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports raised the prospect of a global trade war that could halt US economic growth.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.29% to 89.96.
Trump said Thursday, the US will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% tariff on aluminium. The highly controversial move raised fears that the U.S.’s main trading partners including China could take countermeasures, triggering a global trade war.
The EU has been quick to retaliate as Reuters reported that the trading bloc is considering setting duties on about $3.5 billion of U.S. imports if the United States proceeds with Trump’s tariff proposals.
Fearing the break out of a global trade war, traders piled into safe-haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc, adding to downward momentum in the greenback.
USD/JPY fell 0.69% to Y105.49, while the USD/CHF to 0.9372. Demand usually rises for the yen and the Swissy in times of geopolitical tension or market turbulence because both countries have large current account surpluses.
Much move higher in the yen, however, came overnight as Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the central bank would consider exiting from ultra-loose monetary policy measures by 2019 as there was a high probability that inflation would hit the bank's target.
The pound failed to capitalize on dollar weakness amid Brexit-related woes after UK Prime Minister Theresa May conceded that Brexit will reduce the UK’s access to the single market, reducing the chances of a so-called soft Brexit.
Action Economics said May's speech was notable for the fact that she finally admitted that the UK will have less access to the single market, implying that a ""soft"" Norway or Swiss-like deal is off the cards.

1519,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 11:02AM ET</span>",Special report: A journey on a caravan of misery,"By Alexandra Ulmer
CARACAS (Reuters) - Just after dawn, dozens of Venezuelans gathered at the dark bus station in Caracas. They lugged one big suitcase each, as well as blankets, toilet paper, cheap bread and jugs of water. Weeping wives, confused children and elderly parents hugged them over and over until it was time to check tickets and weigh bags, then hung back, waiting hours for the bus to leave. When it finally pulled out, the passengers looked down at their loved ones, pounding on the windows and blowing kisses as they speeded out of this crumbling capital city.
On board the bus, web developer Tony Alonzo had sold his childhood guitar to help pay for his ticket to Chile. For months he had been going to bed hungry so that his 5-year-old brother could have something for dinner. Natacha Rodriguez, a machine operator, had been robbed at gunpoint three times in the past year. She was headed for Chile, too, hoping to give her baseball-loving son a better life. Roger Chirinos was leaving his wife and two young children behind to search for work in Ecuador. His outdoor advertising company had come to a bitter end: Protesters tore down his billboards to use as barricades during violent rallies against authoritarian President Nicolas Maduro. 
Their bus tells the story of a once-wealthy nation in stomach-dropping free fall, as hundreds of people flee daily from a land where fear and want are the new normal.
By the time dawn rises over Caracas, hungry people are already picking through garbage while kids beg in front of bakeries. Come dusk, many Venezuelans shut themselves inside their homes to avoid muggings and kidnappings. In a country with the world's largest proven crude reserves, some families now cook with firewood because they cannot find propane. Hospitals lack supplies as basic as disinfectant. Food is so scarce and pricey that the average Venezuelan lost 24 pounds last year. 
""I feel Venezuela has succumbed to an irreversible evil,"" Chirinos said.
Many blame the country's precipitous decline on the government of Maduro, who has tightened his grip on power, holding fast to statist policies that have throttled the economy. His government says it is facing a U.S.-led conspiracy to sabotage leftism in Latin America by hoarding goods and stoking inflation.
Poorer by the day, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have concluded that escape is their only option. With the country's currency virtually worthless and air travel beyond the reach of all but elites, buses have become Venezuela's caravans of misery, rolling day and night to its borders and returning largely empty to begin the process all over again.
The 37 Venezuelans leaving on this day had hocked everything – motorbikes, TVs, even wedding rings – to pay for their escape. Most had never been outside the country before. 
For nine days, a reporter and a photographer from Reuters accompanied the migrants as they headed for what they hoped were better days in Ecuador, Peru, Chile and Argentina. For nearly 5,000 miles, they rolled through some of South America's most spectacular landscapes, including the vertiginous Andean mountain range and the world's driest desert in Chile. But even though the Venezuelans were awed by the views whizzing by their window, their minds were mostly on the land they had left behind – and the uncertainty facing them in the lands ahead.
FROM CARACAS TO CONCON
A heavy silence fell over the bus after it pulled out of the Rutas de America terminal. Passengers glumly texted family members or stared out the window as the packed vehicle rolled by mango trees, shuttered factories and crumbling murals of the late President Hugo Chavez.
Natacha Rodriguez, the machine operator, had been running on adrenaline in the mad rush to pack, sell her television and washing machine, and endure long lines to get her documents in order. Now, on this day in November, she was near exhaustion as she tried to get comfortable in her seat.
The 29-year-old single mom was traveling with her 12-year-old son, David, her sister Alejandra and a family friend, Adrian Naveda, to what she dreamed would be a quiet life. The group was bound for Concon, Chile, a beach resort where Venezuelan expat friends assured them there was plenty of work.
Rodriguez said she had hoped Venezuela's youth could bring about change. Like millions of her countrymen, she took to the streets to protest the unpopular Maduro last year, only to despair when he responded by consolidating his authority.
Fear added to Rodriguez's hopelessness: Her story of three robberies at gunpoint is a familiar one in a country awash with drugs and gangs. And with inflation fast outrunning her paycheck, the already petite woman had lost 13 pounds as she cut fruit and soft drinks from her diet so that David would not go hungry. She knew she had to act.
""In Venezuela you go to sleep thinking about what you're going to eat the next day,"" Rodriguez said. ""I never wanted to leave, but the situation is forcing me to.""
She had never left the country, and the enormity of what she was attempting was sinking in. In the days ahead she would visit four new countries, cross the equator and see the Pacific Ocean for the first time. But she couldn't stop thinking of how far she had traveled from the home she still loved.
'FIGHTING AGAINST THE TIDE'
Venezuelans elected Chavez, the late leftist firebrand, in 1998 with a mandate to fight inequality. A charismatic former lieutenant colonel, Chavez transformed the country during his 14-year rule, pouring oil revenue into wildly popular welfare programs. But he also nationalized large swaths of the economy and implemented strict currency controls, state meddling that economists say is the root of the current crisis.
Once a magnet for European and Middle Eastern immigrants during its 1970s oil boom, Venezuela now exports its people along with petroleum.
Spooked by Chavez, a first wave of engineers, doctors and other professionals began fleeing for the United States, Canada and Europe in the early 2000s. Most arrived to warm welcomes in their adopted homes, many with their savings intact.
Now, financially ravaged Venezuelans with fewer skills are pouring across South America in a frantic search for work in restaurants, stores, call centers and construction sites. Some travel only as far as their savings will stretch: A one-way bus ticket to neighboring Colombia from Caracas costs the U.S. equivalent of around $15; the fare for a trip to Chile or Argentina can run as high as $350, a small fortune for many. The plunging currency and rocketing inflation make financing the voyage more expensive with each passing day.
Sociologist Tomas Paez, an immigration specialist at the Central University of Venezuela, estimates that almost 3 million people have fled Venezuela over the past two decades. He believes nearly half of them have left in the last two years alone, in one of the largest mass migrations the continent has ever seen. The socialist government does not release emigration statistics, but Maduro says his enemies have exaggerated the extent of the exodus. 
Neighboring Colombia has taken in the bulk of migrants in Latin America, although Argentina, Chile and Peru are also seeing a big influx.
In contrast to refugees fleeing Syria, Myanmar and North Africa who have met with violence and resistance, Venezuelans are moving easily across land borders on tourist visas. But tensions are increasing as their numbers strain the resources of South America's developing countries, which have their own problems with poverty and crime.
Carmen Larrea has a front-row seat to the migration. She is the owner of Rutas de America, a small Caracas-based bus company founded nearly 50 years ago to ferry Peruvians and Ecuadoreans to Venezuela in search of work.
At 75, she has lived long enough to see the world turned upside down. She now survives on Venezuelans heading in the other direction. Her customers included the 37 migrants whom Reuters followed.
Larrea's terminal sees dozens queue up daily to purchase tickets. Many must return repeatedly to pay in installments. Daily withdrawal limits on debit cards no longer keep up with inflation-fueled prices. Card readers frequently crash.
Requests for tickets abroad had roughly doubled in the last six months, Larrea said. Around 800 Venezuelans leave the country every month on her company's handful of Caracas-based buses alone.
But skyrocketing prices for spare parts and the plunging bolivar have hammered her profits, Larrea said. And while Rutas de America buses leave Caracas jam-packed, they often return empty, further denting business.
""We're fighting against the tide,"" she said.
'HERE NO ONE SPEAKS ILL OF CHAVEZ'
By daybreak, the bus had arrived in the garbage-strewn Venezuelan town of San Antonio del Tachira, near the Colombian border. The teeming frontier is a lifeline for desperate Venezuelans. They cross daily to sell goods like liquor, copper, even their own hair, often making more money in a day in Colombia than in a month back home.
Maduro has increased security at the border in an attempt to crack down on contraband. The bus riders were forced to disembark and pass through half a dozen checkpoints on foot, struggling to haul their suitcases, backpacks, blankets, food and water jugs under the searing sun. Trudging to the narrow Simon Bolivar International Bridge that links Venezuela to Colombia, they walked under a big government sign that read: ""Here no one speaks ill of Chavez.""
The gauntlet took five hours, in part because the Venezuelan migration office's computers crashed. The travelers' apprehensions grew as Venezuelan soldiers, known for shaking down border crossers, searched their bags repeatedly.
Passenger Chirinos, the ad man, was carrying $200 in U.S. currency, a precious hedge against inflation. A National Guard soldier demanded half of it to let him through with an old Playstation video game console deemed contraband. Chirinos handed over a $20 bill to end the standoff.
""Our own people rob us,"" Chirinos said later, recounting the humiliation.
The Armed Forces did not respond to a request for comment.
Just a few years ago, the 34-year-old Chirinos was solidly middle class. He boxed at a gym and splurged on vacations, including a 2014 trip to Rio de Janeiro with his wife.
But as the crisis worsened, even small indulgences like movie tickets spiraled out of reach. Chirinos cut down on his own food intake to ensure his two children had enough to eat. He began to pray daily that his kids would never fall ill; there was no medicine to treat them. 
The coup de grace came during anti-government protests last year when the demonstrators outside the capital knocked down his company's billboards to shield themselves from National Guard soldiers. The enterprise his parents had founded in the 1970s was all but lost.
Several passengers around him wept as they listened to his story. Chirinos, an athletic man with a shaved head and goatee, remained stony-faced.
""I don't have time for resentment,"" he said. ""What I feel is deep sadness.""
'I HAVE TO BE STRONG AND CONTINUE'
Once over the border in the buzzing Colombian town of Cucuta, Jehovah's Witnesses, vendors and hustlers of all stripes descended on the overwhelmed migrants. The streets of Cucuta were already full of poor Venezuelans, some sleeping in parks and washing their clothes in creeks because they had no money to travel farther.
The bus passengers immediately bought Colombian pesos in crowded exchange houses where wads of near-worthless Venezuelan bills flew out of money-counting machines. The bolivar has lost a mind-boggling 98 percent against the U.S. dollar in the last year, meaning $100 worth of local currency a year ago is worth just $2 now.
Pesos in hand, the migrants boarded a new Rutas de America bus waiting for them in Cucuta. The vehicle climbed upward into the foggy Colombian mountains. Out the window, farmers in traditional Andean ponchos tended their herds.
Crossing the city of Bucaramanga, Naveda, the family friend who was traveling with Rodriguez and her son, learned by text that his great-grandmother had died. The 23-year-old felt an urge to turn back. But he knew the rest of his family was depending on him to send money home once he reached Chile and found employment.
""I have to be strong and continue,"" Naveda said.
Even though entering other parts of Latin America on temporary tourist visas is easy for Venezuelans, some are struggling to secure jobs and work permits. Those who strike out often get back on the road to try their luck in another country. In the United States, for example, Venezuelans now lead monthly applications for affirmative asylum.
Others are forced to return to Venezuela, broke and distraught. Maduro has warned Venezuelans that life in ""capitalist"" societies is tough.
""In six months you'll be back in Venezuela,"" the president said in a recent televised address.
Meanwhile, his government is benefiting from migrant remittances that are helping to prop up Venezuela's economy and keep a lid on unrest in the nation of about 30 million. The government does not release remittance figures. But the Inter-American Dialogue think tank estimated that some $2 billion flowed into Venezuela last year from citizens working abroad.
Other Latin Americans have been largely sympathetic to Venezuelans' troubles. Chileans, for instance, note that Venezuela sheltered thousands of their exiled countrymen during Gen. Augusto Pinochet's right-wing dictatorship in the 1970s.
But the influx is stoking tensions with some South American workers who view Venezuelans as rivals. News broadcasts increasingly feature stories about Venezuelans committing crimes. In Brazil, Venezuelans are already living in shelters just over the border in Boa Vista. In Colombia, the government says it has treated more than 24,000 Venezuelans for medical emergencies, and authorities in January evicted more than 200 homeless Venezuelans from an athletic field in Cucuta. In a possible sign of further crackdowns ahead, Brazil and Colombia tightened their borders in February as they grapple with the influx.
Despite the hardships of starting over, almost all Venezuelans on the bus journey said they planned to help relatives leave – or ""get them out,"" as most now say.
'IT'S A NEW WORLD!'
The bus plowed on, stopping in Colombia's western Cauca province on the third day to let the Venezuelans shower and eat. The week before, hundreds of Venezuelans had been stranded there for several days after indigenous Colombian protesters blocked the highway to demand better living conditions from the government.
Milena Ramos, who works in a store at the roadside stop there, recalled the helplessness of the marooned Venezuelans.
""Some slept on the bus, others on the floor. People from the area brought them food and water. They were in a bad state,"" Ramos said. She estimated that up to eight buses full of Venezuelans pull up every day.
Just before 2 a.m. on the fourth day of the journey, the bus arrived at the frigid Colombian border town of Ipiales, near the Ecuadorean border, 9,508 feet high in the Andes. The shivering Venezuelans, almost none of whom had warm coats, lined up in the dark to get their passports stamped. Several more buses pulled up, unloading more of their countrymen.
As they crossed into Ecuador, the Venezuelans told border agents they were tourists; the bored-looking officials stamped their documents and waved them through. Any who are rejected just wait to cross during the next shift, handlers and food sellers there told Reuters.
As the bus kept heading southward, the Venezuelans expressed amazement at the views from their windows: Plump cows. Functioning traffic lights. Fully stocked store shelves. Thriving corn and coffee fields. People nonchalantly wearing gold jewelry on the streets.
""It's a new world!"" exclaimed 7-year-old Josmer Rivas. Back home, the boy sometimes missed school because his family couldn't afford a few U.S. cents' worth of transport costs. In the Ecuadorean capital, Quito, Josmer was so excited to find soap in a bathroom that he insisted on dishing it out to everyone.
Still, the mood on the bus was often heavy, especially among parents who took advantage of stops to call children left behind. Billboard company owner Chirinos, who disembarked in Ecuador and headed straight to the home of some Venezuelan friends who were putting him up, felt lost without his kids. Some migrants had swollen ankles or painful backs after several days on the road. Others were sick of munching their stashes of white bread and other cheap staples.
For Rodriguez, the single mom, warm food at the rest stops was a luxury she splurged on only for her son, David. He was excited about the trip at first, thinking it was a sort of vacation. But as the voyage dragged on, he became tired and threw up one night on a winding mountain road in Colombia. He wondered why they hadn't taken a plane.
Although many Venezuelan parents entrust their children to relatives and send for them once they have a toehold abroad, Rodriguez said she couldn't risk it.
""What if they limit emigration or entry to other countries, or everything becomes more expensive and I can't get him out?"" she said. ""I wasn't going to be at peace with myself if I went and left him.""
When in the early evening the bus pulled into Guayaquil, the last stop on the Rutas de America line, little Josmer Rivas flew into the arms of his overjoyed father, who had emigrated to Ecuador four months earlier.
Rodriguez's foursome and a few others boarded a midnight bus to continue their journey south to Chile, some carrying tuna and crackers given to them by those who had disembarked. Again, the buses were mostly filled with Venezuelans – easily recognizable by their bulky bags and jugs of water – although they were now rubbing shoulders with grungy Western backpackers.
The voyage across Peru was uneventful, punctuated by views of the Pacific Ocean and Hollywood action films on video screens hanging from the bus ceiling. But potential trouble loomed at the crossing into Chile, one of Latin America's most stable and prosperous nations. Police grilled the Venezuelans sharply.
""How much money do you have?"" one officer asked Rodriguez. ""Do you know Chile is an expensive country? Do you know there are Venezuelans sleeping under bridges here? Are you and your child going to sleep under a bridge?""
Rodriguez, unflustered, responded that she had a place to stay and enough money to get by.
She and the rest of the group eventually were admitted into Chile. Beaming, they hugged quickly before yet another bus journey, to Santiago – nearly 1,300 miles to the south. 
Alonzo, the Chile-bound web developer, was not so lucky. He had tarried a few days in Peru to spend time with a cousin. Arriving at the same border crossing just a few days after Rodriguez, he was refused entry by Chilean police.
STARTING OVER
It was just the latest in a series of setbacks for Alonzo, who had been trying to leave Venezuela for two years. His trip had been thwarted twice after he was forced to use savings for medical bills, first for a lung problem and another time to fix an infected molar. 
When the 26-year-old web developer finally left Venezuela, he had just $230 in his pocket, scraped together from loans from friends as well as a fire sale of his dearest possessions.
""I sold the guitar I had since I was 16. I sold my computer. I sold my bed,"" Alonzo said.
He had hoped his programing skills would be snapped up in Chile, a budding technology hub. But after he was turned back at the border, Alonzo had little choice but return to his cousin's apartment in the Peruvian capital, Lima.
Chirinos and Rodriguez have fared better, both quickly obtaining work and legal papers.
Chirinos has rented an apartment in Quito and is working six days a week at a graphic design and advertising company. He spends what little free time he has with old friends from Venezuela.
A family man to the bone, Chirinos says he feels incomplete without his wife, 9-year-old son and baby daughter and wants to bring them over as soon as possible.
""I'm terrified about what's happening in Venezuela, and I don't want my children to grow up in such a heavy and negative environment,"" said Chirinos, whose family is surviving off the money he sends.
Down in Chile, Rodriguez waits tables at a busy seafront restaurant popular with tourists. She initially slept on the floor in a crowded two-bedroom apartment packed with Venezuelans. Now she sleeps in a room with David because her sister and friend Naveda moved to their own place, freeing up space in the apartment.
Rodriguez relishes simple pleasures: walking alone to a nighttime party; finding soap at pharmacies. She was especially thrilled to buy her son a bicycle for Christmas.
David loves his new home. He quickly made friends – all Chileans – and has ditched baseball, a major sport in Venezuela, in favor of pick-up soccer at a field near his home. Photos sent from Rodriguez's cell phone show the boy grinning astride his black mountain bike in one shot, tucking into a hamburger at McDonald's in another.
Rodriguez herself, meanwhile, gets frequent news about Venezuela from her mother and siblings. Hungry mobs have been looting stores as shortages and inflation worsen. Maduro has just announced he is running for re-election in May. With the opposition's two main leaders barred from holding office, the unpopular president looks likely to clinch a six-year term.

In Chile, Rodriguez has found the tranquility she longed for. Still, she cannot let go of Venezuela. 
""Every day I ask myself – how long will it be until I can return?""

1523,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 06:31AM ET</span>",These Could Be the Euro's Five Most Important Days This Year,"(Bloomberg) -- For fresh highs in the euro, bulls need the go-ahead from the European Central Bank’s President as well as positive politics in a make-or-break week for the currency.
It’s not often that a currency faces so many risk events within a short period of time. Sunday’s Italian election and the German Social Democrats’ ballot on a coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel come only a few days before Mario Draghi takes the stand on March 8 and the next U.S. payrolls report.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg now expect the ECB’s Governing Council to revise the forward guidance on its asset-purchase program only by the June 14 meeting. There is therefore room for a hawkish surprise, especially if Draghi sees slowing euro-area inflation as transitory.
The euro fell in February for the first time in four months, yet it still trades higher this year as its bullish trend remains intact. Its rebound on Thursday amid a bearish technical signal for the greenback serves as a reminder of this. However, the trend faces a bigger test next week.
A win for the euroskeptics in the Italian vote or higher chances of fresh elections in Germany would be an inevitable drag for the common currency. A win for Italy’s anti-establishment Five Star Movement wouldn’t definitely mean a referendum on the euro, yet common currency bulls would not feel confident in adding more exposure.
Further political instability in the euro area’s largest economy may be a greater danger for the currency market as another grand coalition in Germany is the market’s base case scenario, longer-term risk reversals in euro-dollar show.
Euro bears would look for the 55-daily moving average support to give way on a closing basis. They would then need to challenge the all-important $1.2070-$1.2090 area, which supported the greenback up to Jan. 12, before the common currency rallied to its $1.2555 three-year high. A decisive close below could even mean a retracement toward $1.1554 on an Elliott wave basis.
Should the euro escape from political limbo, resistance at $1.2350 may briefly stand in the way before any Draghi-inspired rally. The ECB president has little ammunition to use when it comes to the euro and verbal intervention. On a trade-weighted basis, the common currency is 1 percent lower compared to the latest gathering in January, while its realized volatility versus the dollar has dropped near average levels.
The next big resistance level in euro-dollar comes near $1.2620, where the trendline since its all-time highs comes into play.

1526,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 09:33PM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar Suffers from Trump’s Metal Tariff ,"Investing.com - The dollar plunged overnight in Asia from six-week highs after U.S. President Donald Trump decided to tax steel and aluminum as high as 25% and 10% respectively and Powell delivered a less upbeat testimony at the Senate panel. The Aussie and the yen appreciated as the dollar was off the recovery track.
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies was last quoted at 90.16 at 9:10pm ET, down 0.07%.
The tariff decision from Trump triggered market fear of a potential trade war with China. The dollar had been recovering to climb above the 90 handle following a hawkish tone from Federal Reserve’s new chief Powell that hinted faster rate hikes or even a fourth hike, but the White House’s decision stopped the momentum. The dollar started to dip a couple of hours before the tariff news, as Powell’s second appearance, this time at Sentate Banking Committee where he said “no strong evidence of a decisive move up in wages”, made investors drop bet on further rate hikes.
The dollar was quoted against the yen 0.19% lower at 106.01. The USD/JPY pair changed hands this morning as the dollar was dragged down by Trump’s tariff policy and the yen got boosted by an unemployment rate of 2.4% - near 25-year low – versus the estimated 2.8%. In addition, The Bank of Japan is still focusing on achieving the 2 percent inflation rate. Its governor Haruhiko Kuroda said “easing won’t continue if CPI is 2% in a stable manner”.

1527,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 03:56AM ET</span>",Yen stands tall as trade war concerns grip markets,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - The Japanese yen jumped half a percent against the dollar and is set to score significant gains against the euro on Friday as prospects of a trade war gripped markets after U.S. President Donald Trump announced hefty new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
With Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda catching currency markets by surprise by saying the central bank will consider an exit from its ultra-easy monetary policy if its inflation target is achieved in the year ending in March 2020, the yen was holding near its strongest levels this year.
""The underlying tone is one of caution in global markets, especially as a Bank of Japan policy meeting next week assumes significance after Kuroda's latest comments,"" said Manuel Oliveri, London-based FX strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR).
Short yen positions, at $12.62 billion, are near record levels hit in early 2014 as investors have bet that monetary policy divergence between the U.S. central bank and the Bank of Japan will increase over time.
The greenback was nearly 0.5 percent lower at 105.75 yen  after touching 105.70 earlier, its lowest since Feb. 16. Against the euro (EURJPY=EBS) and sterling (GBPJPY=EBS), the yen was 0.3 and 0.5 percent higher respectively. 
Speculation about when the BOJ, which has significantly lagged its peers in moving toward policy normalization, would explore an exit from easy policy has been one of the key themes impacting the yen.
DOLLAR WEAKENS
The dollar was on the back foot even before Kuroda spoke, having pulled sharply back from six-week highs after U.S. Trump's decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum took the wind out of the greenback's week-long recovery.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies (DXY) fell 0.1 percent to 90.194.
Trump announced on Thursday that he would impose large tariffs on imported steel and aluminum to protect U.S. producers, risking retaliation from major trade partners such as China, Europe and Canada.
But investors were wary of kicking the dollar much lower, particularly against the euro and sterling, due to looming political developments.
The focus for the euro was on Sunday's Italian parliamentary election and the level of support for populist agendas that could have a wider impact on the European Union.
Also on Sunday, Germany's Social Democrats announce the result of a binding members' vote on a coalition deal that would secure Angela Merkel a fourth term as chancellor.
The single currency (EUR=EBS) was flat around $1.2271.

British Prime Minister Theresa May will lay out her views on how to keep trade open between all of the United Kingdom and the European Union in a key speech at around 1330 GMT on Friday.

1528,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 01:55PM ET</span>",Forex - USD/JPY Turns Negative as US Tariffs Trigger Risk-Off Sentiment,"Investing.com – The dollar surrendered gains against a basket of major currencies after President Donald Trump said the U.S. will impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports next week, fuelling investor fears of a trade war.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.12% to 90.72.
Trump said the US will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% tariff on aluminium. The highly controversial move raised fears that the U.S.’s main trading partners including the China could take countermeasures, fuelling fears that trade war could break out.
European Union and Chinese officials were said to be considering a retaliation by targeting American products with political significance.
Fearing a potential trade war, traders piled into safe-haven currencies like the yen, which pared losses against the greenback to trade roughly unchanged on the day.
Offsetting that, however, were hawkish comments from Bill Dudley, who said four rate hikes this year would fit into the Fed’s plans to raise rates gradually. That came as Fed chair Jerome Powell testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday.
Powell told a US Senate panel on Thursday that he does not see any evidence currently that the US economy is “overheating,” and insisted that there was little to suggest that wage growth has increased significantly.
Powell’s comments came on the heels of mixed economic data showing inflation continued to lag the Fed’s 2% target, while manufacturing growth remained solid topping economists’ expectations.
The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, rose 1.5% in the 12 months through January.
The Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing index rose to 60.8 in February, up from the 59.1 reading seen last month.
Following the recent round of the wage hikes by a host of US companies including Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) – as a result of lower taxes – consumer income rose 0.4% January, beating economists’ expectations of a 0.3% rise.
GBP/USD fell 0.25% to $1.3725 as negative brexit-related commentary overshadowed upbeat manufacturing data.

GBP/USD hit a low of 1.3732, the weakest level since Jan. 15 and was at 1.3740 by 05:17 AM ET (10:17 AM GMT), off 0.14% for the day.
The dollar remained supported after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. economic outlook remains bright, bolstering bets on further Fed rate hikes this year.
The remarks bolstered expectations that the U.S. central bank may deliver four rate increases this year, rather than the three it had earlier signaled.
Expectations of rising borrowing costs tend to buoy the dollar, as higher rates make the U.S. currency more attractive to yield-seeking investors.
Investors were awaiting a second day of congressional testimony by Powell later in the day, to see if the Fed head would reaffirm his hawkish view of the economy.
Sterling came under pressure after data on Thursday showing that UK factory activity growth hit its lowest level in eight months in February amid uncertainty over Brexit.
Research firm Markit said its manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 55.2 last month, from 55.3 in January.
The pound was also pressured lower by renewed worries over Brexit after British Prime Minister Theresa May said the EU's draft legal text published on Wednesday would undermine Britain and threaten its constitutional integrity.
Sterling was lower against the euro, with EUR/GBP rising 0.15% to 0.8875.
In the euro zone, data on Thursday showed that manufacturing activity slowed slightly in February but remained robust.
The final reading of the manufacturing PMI for the euro zone fell to 58.6 in February from 59.6 in January.

“The economic outlook remains strong,” he said. “Further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote attainment of both of our objectives.”
Powell was speaking at his first semi-annual monetary policy testimony to the House Financial Services Committee since taking over the helm of Fed earlier this month.
Market participants were looking ahead to the second part of Powell's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee due later Thursday.

1531,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 02:00AM ET</span>","Dollar underpinned by Powell, euro at five-week low versus dollar","By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held firm on Thursday, drawing support after the Federal Reserve's new chief Jerome Powell struck an optimistic tone on the U.S. economy in a boost to rate hawks that sent global stocks tumbling.
In contrast, benign inflation data in the euro zone dented expectations that the European Central Bank will dial back its stimulus, slamming the euro to five-week lows against the dollar and a six-month nadir against the yen.
The dollar index rose to a five-week high of 90.746, as Powell's optimism on the U.S. economy suggested the Fed is going to raise interest rates four times this year, one more than what markets had expected.
On the other hand, ECB president Mario Draghi said on Monday slack in the euro zone economy may be bigger than previously estimated.
""Powell was more hawkish than anticipated. In addition, Draghi wasn't that aggressive when he spoke earlier this week, so there is a clear contrast,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo Branch Manager at State Street.
The euro dropped to $1.21835 (EUR=EBS), its lowest since Jan. 18. Against the yen, the single currency fell to 129.86 yen (EURJPY=), its weakest since early September and down 5.6 percent from its 2-1/2-year high hit just a month ago.
Euro zone inflation slowed to a 14-month low in February, data showed on Wednesday, underscoring why the ECB remains cautious about removing stimulus despite growth exceeding expectations.
Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro slowed to 1.2 percent from 1.3 percent in January, in line with expectations but far from the ECB's long elusive target of almost 2 percent.
""Markets are pricing in the chance that the ECB will raise interest rates as early as by the end of this year, so a return of a scenario of another extension in its bond buying and pushing back a rate hike into 2019 could put pressure on the euro,"" Makoto Noji, senior strategist at Nikko SMBC said in report.
The euro was also hurt by political uncertainties as Italians are preparing to vote in a national election on Sunday, while the leading political parties in Germany decide on a coalition deal that would secure Angela Merkel a fourth term as chancellor.
The British pound was pressured by renewed worries over Brexit after British Prime Minister Theresa May said the EU's draft legal text published on Wednesday would undermine Britain and threaten its constitutional integrity.
The pound fell to $1.3743 <GBP=D4>, its lowest level since mid-January. The euro firmed to 0.88625 pound (EURGBP=D4), having risen almost 1 percent from this week's low of 0.8772 touched on Monday.
Still, some say the dollar could falter again given that any support for the currency from higher interest rates - the main driver of its gains until early 2017 - has been tenuous.
In fact, the dollar index fell almost 10 percent last year, the biggest fall in more than a decade even though no other major central banks raised interest rates other than the Fed, which not only hiked rates three times but also started trimming down its balance sheet.
The dollar index is still down 1.5 percent this year, dogged by suspicions that the Trump Administration prefers a weaker dollar to mend its bulging trade deficit, and worries its big tax cuts and spending plans may boost fiscal deficits to an extent that they undermine confidence in U.S. debt.
The yen eased about 0.1 percent in Asia on Thursday to 106.80 per dollar <JPY=>, still maintaining slim gains for the week.
On top of safety bids stemming from wobbly share prices, the yen also got a boost from the previous day's Bank of Japan bond-buying operations, where the central bank trimmed the amount of its buying in super-long Japanese government bonds.
Repatriation of funds by corporates ahead of Japan's financial year-end on March 31 also rendered additional help.
The Australian dollar hit a two-month trough versus the dollar and a nine-month low versus the yen after data on Australian business investment showed a 0.2 percent dip for the December quarter, missing forecasts for a 0.9 percent increase.
The Australian dollar traded 0.5 percent down at $0.7726, having briefly fallen to as low as $0.7717 <AUD=D4>.
""The Aussie looked bearish after it had fallen below its 200-day moving average and the weak data triggered renewed weakness,"" State Street's Wakabayashi said.
""With Australian bond yields no longer higher than U.S. bonds, it no longer has the attraction it used to have for a long time. I'm quite bearish on the currency,"" he added.

The U.S. 10-year yield (US10YT=RR) surpassed the 10-year Australian bond yield (AU10YT=RR) late last month.

The US dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies gained 0.04% to reach a five-week high at 90.65 at 10:52pm ET thanks to Powell’s hawkish tone of rate hikes on Tuesday.
Powell’s upbeat remarks on the U.S. economy sent the dollar to break the 90 handle and the momentum has not faded as the markets await more signals from him for a potential fourth rate hike. He is to testify before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.
The USD/JPY pair changed hands, trading 0.06% higher at 106.74. Bank of Japan’s policy board member Goushi Kataoka called for more easing efforts to achieve the central bank’s 2% inflation target, saying the price situation in Japan was no longer deflationary. But he warned that achieving the 2% inflation target during the 2019 fiscal year is unlikely.
The AUD/USD pair plunged 0.43% to 0.7728. The Aussie tumbled to a new low level this year following a big miss in Q4 CAPEX. The country’s Q4 seasonally adjusted CAPEX fell 0.2% QoQ, failing to meet market estimates of a 0.9% growth.

A pair of reports on housing and manufacturing, meanwhile, also added to negative sentiment.
The Chicago business barometer, a closely-watched indicator by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) slipped to 61.9 in February from 65.7 in January.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department showed pending home sales fell 4.7% in February, a steeper decline that economists had forecast.
Downside momentum in the dollar, however, was limited by weakness in sterling.
GBP/USD fell 0.77% to $1.38 as Brexit concerns resurfaced. Actions Economics said both UK Prime Minister Theresa May and Northern Ireland's DUP party rejected the European Union proposal of a ""common regulatory area"" in the island of Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit scenario.

1538,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 02:39AM ET</span>",Currency speculators play deaf as analysts yell 'year of the yen',"By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) -  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) calls it ""the year of the yen"".  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) proclaims it's the ""land of the rising yen"". While, Citi has turned into a dollar bear with its latest report ""we continue to holler - sell the dollar.""
Though most speculators have still to heed them, analysts are lining up to call a higher yen, expecting its traditional safe harbor status to draw investors made nervous by ballooning U.S. deficits and heightened financial market volatility.  
A stronger yen, making imports cheaper, would undermine the Bank of Japan's primary goal of increasing price growth to wrench the economy out of a long deflationary phase.
But analysts reckon the central bank may have run out of policy ammunition to resist the upward pull on the yen exerted by Japan's improved economic growth and huge current account surplus. 
""The Japanese yen can easily be the top performer among the G-10 currencies,"" said Momtchil Pojarliev, deputy head of currencies at BNP Paribas Asset Management, referring to the Group of Ten advanced countries. 
""The Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains dovish for now, but this means that the next policy shift can only be hawkish,"" he added. ""Second, the Japanese yen is one of the cheapest currencies in the world. Third, the return of financial market uncertainty is supportive for the Japanese yen.""
Yet currency speculators appear deaf to all the hollering, having built huge short positions in yen futures  even as the currency rallied to 105.5 per dollar in February from 114.5 in late-2017. 
Yen short positions remain about 40 percent larger than the past one-year average, and near levels seen in mid-2017.
The numbers are even larger if short yen positions held by Japanese retail investors - colloquially known as Mrs Watanabe - are taken into account. 
Latest monthly data from the Financial Futures Association of Japan (FFAJ) showed that at the end of January, long positions in the dollar-yen trade held by retail currency traders were at 3.009 trillion yen ($28.09 billion). 
That was the highest since January 2015 and more than three times the short positions at 922 billion yen.
If the analysts are right, it sets the scene for a massive shakeout that could see the yen test 100 per dollar or even higher.
'LONG DOLLAR SHORT YEN'
This one-sided positioning has become a major risk for the greenback as a sustained rise in the yen would force investors to close out loss-making positions by buying yet more yen.
A similar unraveling happened in early 2016 when positions in the yen swung sharply from short to long, and the dollar followed by sinking from 120.00 yen to as low as 99.00.
The current short position in the yen is also much larger than back in 2016, even though more analysts are turning bullish toward the Japanese currency.
""This dissonance will eventually be resolved,"" said Morgan Stanley analyst Hans Redekar who expects the dollar to ultimately succumb to twin deficit disease.
""We have to go back to the mid-1960s to find a similar situation, with the U.S. pursuing fiscal expansion despite labor market tightness, strong private sector investment, and widening foreign imbalances,"" says Redekar.
""The result was the breakdown of Bretton Woods. Absent a fixed exchange rate regime, it should instead now lead to USD
weakness.""
DOVISH BOJ
Many analysts, including National Australia Bank, are predicting USD/JPY around 100-105 over the coming months. That could be a setback for Japan's export-driven economy, and a downside risk for inflation.
It would also be a major challenge for the Bank of Japan with inflation still well short of its 2 percent target.
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has gone out of his way to assure investors that policy will remain easy, a commitment underpinned by the government's nomination of two dovish deputies.
History, however, shows the impact of BOJ policies on the currency market has become smaller with every new iteration.
For example, the yen fell for eight consecutive months on expectations of a radical easing in monetary policy when Shinzo Abe was elected prime minister in late 2012.
The yen resumed its slide in 2014 following the BOJ's second round of quantitative easing and reached a 12-1/2-year trough in mid-2015.
But when the BoJ eventually announced its latest yield curve control (YCC) policy in September 2016, the yen's decline was only modest and the currency has since recouped all that fall.
Just this month, investors practically ignored the news of the reappointment of Kuroda and his two new deputies amid doubts policy could be eased any further.
""Markets appear to be seeking clarity about whether the policy direction could really change under new members,"" said Daiju Aoki, Chief Japan Economist at UBS Chief Investment Office Wealth Management.
""We expect no radical change of monetary policy from the current YCC. Market expectations for changing the regime or additional easing, if they surfaced, would not last long.""

Federal Reserve’s new head Jerome Powell delivered an upbeat message at the Congress on Tuesday, acknowledging that the US economy had strengthened recently and the employment market would continue to look bullish. The first rate hike, out of the three expected hikes, is expected in March when the Fed has its next policy meeting. Investors are betting on a fourth rate hike this year.
Powell also noted that when formulating the monetary policy, the Fed would strike a balance between avoiding the market from overheating while achieving the 2 percent inflation target rate.
Despite the bullish US dollar index, the USD/JPY pair turned red, trading 0.10% lower at 107.22, after The Bank of Japan announced the decision to cut the purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) with 25-40 years to 70 billion yen, compared to 80 million yen the Bank purchase on Friday. The reduction was cited as a tailwind for the yen.
The Aussie traded against the dollar at 0.05% higher to 0.7793, but quoted 0.04% lower to 83.57 against the yen. The sentiment-sensitive Aussie was dragged down by the disappointing Chinese PMI data this morning. Both the Manufacturing and Non-Maunfacturing PMIs failed to meet analyst expectations, with the former recording 50.3 versus the previous 51.3 and the later 54.4 from the previous 55.3. The decline in Australia’s largest trading partner prompted traders to sell the Aussie.
Elsewhere, the PBOC set the fix rate against the dollar at 6.3294 versus yesterday’s rate of 6.3146. The USD/CNY pair was quoted at 6.3281, up 0.21%."
1540,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 01:55AM ET</span>",Fed rate hike bets underpin dollar after Powell testimony; yen rises,"By Masayuki Kitano
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar stood near a three-week high against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, after upbeat views from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on the economy encouraged bets on further Fed interest rate hikes this year.
Testifying before the U.S. House of Representatives' Financial Services Committee, Powell acknowledged the economy had strengthened recently, a remark that prompted investors to increase bets on four Fed rate increases in 2018.
The Fed's last round of economic projections in December pointed to three rate increases this year. 
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, last traded at 90.395 (DXY), after hitting a high of 90.498 on Tuesday, its strongest level in almost three weeks.
""Personally, I wonder whether his (Powell's) comments were all that bullish on the economy, but that seems to be the market's interpretation,"" said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore. 
The Fed is expected to approve its first rate increase of 2018 at its next policy meeting in March, when it will also provide updated economic projections and Powell will hold his first news conference as chair. 
The dollar fell 0.2 percent to 107.10 yen . 
The yen edged higher after the Bank of Japan on Wednesday trimmed the amount of super-long Japanese government bonds (JGBs) it offered to buy at its regular debt buying operation.
BOJ officials have said that any changes to bond-buying operations are fine-tuning and not meant as hints to future policy.
The currency market, however, has been sensitive to adjustments to the BOJ's bond-buying operations, especially after a reduction in the central bank's buying of long-dated JGBs in January sparked speculation that the BOJ was moving toward an exit from its heavy stimulus. 
The yen, a safe haven currency that attracts demand in times of economic uncertainty, also held firm after weak factory data from China dented Asian equities and undermined investor risk appetite.
Analysts said the dollar could face headwinds against the yen over the next few weeks due to the potential for dollar-selling by Japanese players ahead of Japan's financial year-end in March. 
""Once we get past the middle of March and (flows from) exporters and repatriation abate, the dollar will probably gradually show firmness against the yen,"" said Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation's Okagawa. 
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said in parliament on Wednesday that once the central bank starts to normalize monetary policy the process would be ""very gradual"" and that the BOJ would pay attention to any risks to the economy. 
The euro eased 0.1 percent to $1.2224 (EUR=), after briefly slipping to $1.2215, its lowest since Feb. 9. Against the yen, the euro (EURJPY=R) hit a five-month low of 130.82 yen and was last down 0.3 percent at 130.96 yen. 

Analysts have said the euro could be subject to potential swings in price as Italians prepare to vote in a national election on Sunday, and the leading political parties in Germany decide on a coalition deal that could secure Angela Merkel a fourth term as chancellor.

In Capitol Hill testimony, Powell highlighted fiscal policy as new “tailwinds” for the economy, while reiterating that the central bank would stick with “further gradual” increases in interest rates.
While Powell appeared to adopt the narrative of “gradual” rate hikes from his predecessor Janet Yellen, his upbeat outlook on inflation and economic growth raised bets the central bank might hike rates four times in 2018.
“We’ve seen some data that will in my case add some confidence to my view that inflation is moving up to target,” Powell said. “We’ve also seen continued strength around the globe, and we’ve seen fiscal policy become more stimulative.”
Powell’s appearance overshadowed a mixed bag of economic data showing consumer confidence in the economy remained robust while durable goods orders fell short of expectations.
The Conference Board’s consumer confidence gauge rose to 130.8 in February from 124.3 in January, beating economists’ forecast for a reading of 121.
The Commerce Department reported orders for durable goods fell 3.7% last month. Economists’ had forecast a 2.4% fall.
The weaker durable goods number was downplayed by market participants amid weaknesses in aircraft components - civilian orders, parts, and defense orders - which was said to be volatile.

“The economic outlook remains strong,” he said. “Further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote attainment of both of our objectives.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar added to gains against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told U.S. lawmakers the central bank would stick with gradual interest rate increases despite the added stimulus of tax cuts and government spending.
Powell pledged to ""strike a balance"" between the risk of an overheating economy and the need to keep growth on track. His congressional testimony was his first public appearance since being sworn in as chairman earlier this month.
Powell is scheduled to present his remarks to a U.S. House of Representatives committee at a hearing scheduled for 10 a.m. EST (1500 GMT), followed by questions from lawmakers. 
Brad Bechtel, managing director FX at Jefferies, in New York, said Powell's comments were generally positive for the dollar.
""He is hawkish in the context of being very upbeat on the economy but willing to go at a moderate pace to normalize policy,"" Bechtel said.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.26 percent at 90.089.
Some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds, Powell said, noting recent fiscal policy shifts and the global economic recovery.
""That's sort of a big statement if you think about it,"" said Bechtel.
""He's kind of dialed it up just a notch from where (Powell's predecessor, Janet) Yellen was,"" Bechtel said.
The Fed is expected to approve its first rate increase of 2018 at its next policy meeting in March, when it will also provide fresh economic projections and Powell will hold his first news conference. Fed policymakers anticipate three rate increases this year.
""From a 10,000-foot view, Powell's prepared remarks are common-sense,"" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
""It's more interesting to see that the market is interpreting the comments as somewhat hawkish, and that's more informative about the trading bias right now than about the Fed's actually likely policy path.""
The dollar was up 0.19 percent against the Japanese yen  at 107.11 yen.
The euro (EUR=) was down 0.26 percent against the dollar at 1.2284.
Italians vote in a national election on Sunday, while the leading political parties in Germany will decide on a coalition deal that could secure Angela Merkel a fourth term as chancellor.
There was not a whole lot of fear in the market about the outcome of the Italian election, Bechtel said.

""There is a lot of folks looking at hedges but not a huge amount of activity in that space. Kind of an ambivalence toward the election this weekend, which is interesting,"" said Bechtel.

1547,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 08:31PM ET</span>",Yen Tipped to Test 105 Per Dollar as Seasonal Flows Kick in,"(Bloomberg) -- The yen looks set to rise toward 105 against the dollar again, with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. and Daiwa Securities Co. predicting a boost from fiscal year-end repatriation flows.
Japanese exporters left behind in the dollar-yen’s rapid slide this year will sell into any advance in the pair, according to Daiwa. That’s expected to support the yen further, even as market positioning on the currency shows a mixed trend.
The dollar-yen posted an average decline of 3.2 percent in the January-March period in the last four years, making it the worst quarter for the currency pair. Repatriation flows include export payments, coupons or interests from foreign investments, as well as dividends from exporters’ overseas units, according to Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
“The first quarter, especially from February to around mid-March, is a period that typically sparks yen buying,” said Minori Uchida, head of global market research at the lender. “With interest-rate differentials -- which have been a key driver for currency direction -- failing to affect spot levels, investors are turning to flows.”
The yen has climbed 5.5 percent this year and reached a 15-month high of 105.55 per dollar on Feb. 16. It was up 0.1% at 106.81 as of 9:59 a.m. in Tokyo.
Market positioning on the currency is mixed. While asset managers are adding to their longs, most large speculators are clinging to their shorts positions. Leveraged funds remain short even after paring back for six straight weeks, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Although the extent of its appreciation has surprised the market somewhat even in the light of Japan’s current account or trade surpluses, investors have continued to focus on yen-buying factors such as its strength against other currencies, according to Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
“The lack of a clear rebound in yen crosses is also weighing on dollar-yen,” he said, citing the Japanese currency’s gains against the Australian dollar and the euro.
Uchida of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ also pointed to slowing purchases of overseas bonds by local investors, as the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield stays near 3 percent.
The Japanese were net sellers of foreign bonds in each of the three weeks ended Feb. 16, according to data from the Ministry of Finance. Investors are keenly awaiting new Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s testimony to the Congress this week to try and gauge the pace of the U.S. policy tightening.
“With investors unsure right now of whether the U.S. 10-year yield would peak around 3 percent or not, outbound flows which usually help absorb repatriations are currently being withheld,” said Uchida.

The research firm added that with housing starts rising and sales falling in January, the market is ""seeing a replenishment in new homes for sale ahead of the spring selling season.”

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro gained on Monday as a fall in U.S. Treasury yields dragged down the dollar, but trading was relatively quiet ahead of several speeches by central bankers and key political developments in Germany and Italy.
With the dollar's bounce since it hit a three year-low on Feb. 16 fizzling out, the euro was able to rise 0.3 percent and climb to $1.2328 (EUR=). 
But the euro remains 2 cents off its recent highs of more than $1.25 - the currency has rallied this year on the back of dollar weakness - and analysts said investors were cautious about taking big positions this week due to political risks. 
Italians vote in a national election on Sunday, while the leading political parties in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, will decide on a coalition deal that could secure Angela Merkel a fourth term as chancellor.
""We think the market may be underestimating the risks here – especially given that the euro's pro-cyclical and portfolio inflow-driven rally could run out of steam if political risks stay slightly elevated in the near-term,"" ING said in a note.
Analysts pointed to weekly futures data that showed net long positions in the euro had fallen for a third consecutive week. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's appearance in the European Parliament on Monday and euro zone inflation data due later this week also add to a nervous outlook for euro trading. 
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, eased 0.2 percent to 89.685 (DXY). It gained nearly 0.9 percent last week and pulled away from a three-year low near 88.25 set on Feb. 16.
A view that the dollar's sell-off had been overdone, plus minutes from the Fed's January rate-setting meeting that offered a relatively upbeat tone, helped give the dollar a lift last week.
POWELL'S TESTIMONY
The focus this week is Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's first congressional testimony on monetary policy and the economy. 
Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore, said the dollar was weighed down by a drop in the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield eased a tad in Monday's Asian trade to 2.866 percent (US10YT=RR), continuing a slip from the four-year high of 2.957 percent reached on Wednesday.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.17% to 89.81 in late trade. The index climbed 0.9% for the week and is up around 2% since hitting a three year low of 88.15 on February 16.
Demand for the dollar continued to be underpinned after the minutes of the Federal Reserve's January meeting underlined expectations for more aggressive monetary tightening this year.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.10% to 89.75
The Federal Reserve in its monetary policy report said the pace of wage gains was moderate, weighed by low productivity. The central bank also said a serious labour shortage would probably push up wages but did express some concern over high equity valuations.
“The economic expansion continues to be supported by steady job gains, rising household wealth, favorable consumer sentiment, strong economic growth abroad, and accommodative financial conditions,” the report said.
While the policy report did little to suggest a faster pace of rate hikes would be adopted by the central bank it added to narrative of an improving economy, reaffirming investor expectations for the Fed to raise rates next month. The monetary policy report comes ahead of Fed chair Jerome Powell’s testimony to Congress next week.
Also supporting the uptick in the greenback was euro weakness amid investor concerns over the outcome of the Italian election less than two weeks away.
Mizuho bank said the safe haven bid that started Thursday continued to support Treasuries and Bunds, as Italian election polls indicated the Five Star Movement is in the lead and a hung parliament looms.
EUR/USD fell 0.24% to $1.23.
Limiting the advance in the dollar, however, was a rise in the loonie after inflation topped economists’ forecasts.
Canadian inflationary pressures are “heating up,” CIBC said. While Friday's inflation readings were somewhat stronger than expected, the bank said it would maintain its forecast for the Bank of Canada to remain patient in terms of rate hikes amid potential economic headwinds, including NAFTA renegotiations, US tax cuts and new mortgage rules.

The U.S. markets were little changed Thursday, as the Dow added 0.7%, the S&P 500 closed just in the green, while the Nasdaq lost 0.11%.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard warned that too many rate hikes this year would restrict economic growth, and that he did not expect the years of below-target inflation to change rapidly.
Japan’s CPI was in focus as the data showed inflation rose 0.9% in January from a year earlier, compared with a median market forecast of 0.8%.

The yen however showed little reaction following the release of the data, while the Nikkei closed 0.62% higher.

The U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said President Trump’s policies would raise U.S. wages but would not cause broader inflation. “You can have wage inflation and not necessarily have inflation concerns in general,” he said, easing investors’ concern for higher inflation and interest rates.

1561,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2018 07:48AM ET</span>",Euro set for second biggest weekly drop in four months as hedges in focus,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Friday and is set to post its second biggest weekly loss in nearly four months as investors focused on adding hedges to their portfolios before a big week for foreign exchange markets from a European politics perspective.
The outcome of the Italian general election is due on March 4 and the German Social Democrats poll of its members on joining another coalition government with Chancellor Merkel’s conservatives is also due that day, two big political risk events for markets which may trigger fresh market volatility. 
Hedging-related strategies were popular as investors rushed to the currency derivative markets in short tenors to buy option contracts to cover the period over those two events.
In a market where long euro bets are at their largest on record, according to CFTC positioning data, any less than optimal results from either of these two major political events may prompt some hedge funds to sell the single currency.
One trader at a European bank said demand for currency options for euro/dollar around the 1.21 and 1.25 levels over one-week and two-week tenors were seeing ""decent demand"".
Thomson Reuters data showed a buildup in large option bets around those levels. 
Implied volatility on the euro for two-week maturities , a gauge of expected currency swings, was at its highest levels since the outcome of the French elections last April, indicating that some investors were taking no chances.
Risk reversals for two-week maturities, a measure of the extent of positioning in currency derivatives, showed a distinct pick up in the preference for buying euro/dollar puts rather than calls, suggesting investors were protecting against downside risks.
However, market analysts cautioned against reading too much into the derivative markets as the overall perception of political risk in Europe has reduced considerably.
""Political risk is not as much of a factor for the euro as it was last year as risk perception has moderated considerably and for good reason, with Eurosceptic parties moderating their stance to appeal to a wider base,"" said Lefteris Farmakis, a macro strategist at UBS in London.
CONSTRUCTIVE OUTLOOK 
However, with recent surveys and the European Central Bank's minutes of its January policy showing some signs of caution among policymakers about the bloc's economic prospects with the backdrop of a strong euro, investors are searching for fresh catalysts to drive the currency higher.
""Apart from some political concerns, the dollar's outlook also appears to be more constructive in the short term thanks to the rising yields,"" said Manuel Oliveri, an FX strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London.
Markets are assuming from opinion polls that there will be no clear winner to the Italian polls, with either some loose coalition or a minority government likely to emerge.
Indicating the growing caution among European policymakers, ECB officials rejected even a token change in the bank's policy message, arguing that it was premature to signal policy normalization given weak inflation, the minutes of its January meeting showed on Thursday.
That caution is also reverberating in the bond markets. While German government debt yields have risen by 38 basis points since early December, the rise has been slower than in the United States, where yields are up more than 50 bps.
Benchmark Treasury 10-year note yields (US10YT=RR) rose to a four-year high of 2.957 percent on Wednesday before falling back to 2.904 percent on Thursday. 
The prospect of the U.S. government boosting debt issuance to fund expanded stimulus and the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates steadily this year are some of the factors that have contributed to the rise in yields.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies rose 0.2 percent to 89.873 (DXY).
The index reached a 10-day high of 90.235 on Thursday, from a three-year trough of 88.253 late last week, before its rally lost a bit of steam. It was on still on track to gain 0.9 percent on the week. 
The yen showed little reaction to data which showed Japan's annual core consumer inflation rate was unchanged in January from the previous month, reinforcing views that the Bank of Japan remains far from exiting its super loose monetary policy.
Japan's nationwide core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food costs, rose 0.9 percent in January. The pace remained far from the BOJ's 2 percent inflation target.

The dollar edged up 0.1 percent to 106.850 yen .

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.38% to 89.69.
The US 10-year yields fell ahead of new debt issuance and comments from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, pressuring the dollar to give up some of its gains which followed the FOMC minutes Wednesday.
Bullard told CNBC on Thursday that central bankers need to be careful not to raise rates too quickly this year because that could slow the economy amid expectations that other central banks are poised to hike rates this year which could restrict the Fed’s gradual approach to rate hikes.
Upbeat labour market data, meanwhile, added little support to the greenback as the U.S. Department of Labor reported that initial jobless claims fell by 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the week ended Feb. 17 above forecasts for unchanged reading.
The slump in the dollar benefited both the pound and the euro as the latter recovered from somewhat dovish European Central bank minutes.
The ECB’s minutes showed that the central bank continued to believe that patience and persistence was needed as inflation remained weak and agreed that it was “premature” to adjust forward guidance.
EUR/USD rose 0.41% to $1.2332, while GBP/USD rose 0.34% to $1.3966.
USD/JPY fell 0.83% to Y106.88, while USD/CAD rose 0.01% to C$1.2706. The loonie came under pressure following data showing retail sales fell well short of forecasts, stoking investor expectations that the Canadian economy has cooled somewhat.
TD Securities said Thursday's negative retail sales print supports its call for “only two rate hike in 2018,” with the next hike expected as late as July given that the economy has “clearly cooled” and that the medium-term economic outlook is facing several domestic headwinds."

1564,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 03:55AM ET</span>",Dollar climbs on Fed; heads for first weekly gain of 2018,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar inched up to a 10-day high on Thursday, after minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s January meeting showed policymakers confident in rising inflation and the need for interest rates to keep increasing. 
What was widely interpreted as a slightly more upbeat tone in the minutes of the Jan 30-31 meeting, released on Wednesday, cemented expectations that the Fed will hike rates under its new chief Jerome Powell next month, and that rates will be hiked on at least another two occasions in 2018.
The minutes also showed voting members, as well as the wider group of policymakers, had upgraded their forecasts for the economic outlook since December. 
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, climbed to as high as 90.235 (DXY), the strongest since Feb. 13. 
That left the greenback up more than 2 percent from the three-year low it plumbed on Friday, and on track for its first weekly gain of 2018.
""The release of the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) minutes has given the dollar a small lift, with confidence expressed that activity and inflation was moving on the right path to merit further gradual rate hikes,"" said ING's head of currency strategy in London, Chris Turner. 
""(But) the Fed story has not had much bearing on the dollar over recent quarters, where a recovery in investment opportunities overseas and... concerns about Washington’s dollar policy and twin deficits have driven the dollar lower,"" he added. ""We think there is a lot more dollar weakness to come.""
The traditional positive correlation between U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar has broken down this year, with analysts explaining the decoupling by arguing that it is worries about runaway inflation that have been driving yields higher. 
But that correlation was back in place, at least temporarily, on Thursday, with 10-year Treasury yields pushing toward 2.95 percent as the dollar climbed (US10YT=RR). 
Market participants probably interpreted the Fed minutes as leaving open the possibility that the central bank could raise interest rates four times this year, said Hirofumi Suzuki, an economist for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) in Singapore.
""A March rate hike is probably a done deal, and there seems to be an upgrade of the views on the economic outlook, so I can understand how market participants would think that there is a chance that the pace of rate hikes could increase to four times this year,"" Suzuki said.
""But personally, I have doubts as to whether that's the Fed's true intent,"" Suzuki said, adding that chairman Powell's Feb. 28 congressional testimony on monetary policy would be a key near-term focus.

The euro (EUR=) touched its lowest level since Feb. 12 at $1.2260 earlier on Thursday, but was last steady on the day at $1.2283.

But the dollar was lower against the yen, with USD/JPY down 0.29% to 107.45.
Demand for the safe haven yen was boosted as expectations for a faster pace of monetary tightening by the Fed dented equities, souring risk appetite.
Investors tend to seek out the yen in times of market turbulence as the currency is backed by Japan's current account surplus, which offers it more resilience than currencies of deficit-running countries.
The euro was also lower against the yen, with EUR/JPY down 0.37% to 131.89.

The US dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies was quoted at 90.04 at 11pm ET, up 0.01% after climbing as high as 90.166 earlier today, as the Fed’s positive tone pushed the dollar higher this morning to break the 90 handle from a three-year low near 88.25.
“A majority of participants noted that a stronger outlook for economic growth raised the likelihood that futher gradual policy firming policy would be appropriate,” the minutes said. This year will also likely meet the 2 percent inflation target, Fed officials noted.
Inflation within the US economy also contributed to the record highs of bond yields, reaching 2.9537. The CPIs also came better than expected.
But the fall on US equity markets offset the dollar’s momentum fueled by the upbeat tone and strong economic data.
Japanese yen rebounded, with the USD/JPY pair changing hands and quoting at 107.35, down 0.39%. A potential faster pace for US. Interest rate hikes led to risk aversion and was cited as supportive for further yen buying.
The AUD/USD pair once broke the 0.78 handle to 0.7805 in mid-morning but slipped back to 0.7795, down 0.10%. The drop is expected to continue.

Despite resoundingly bearish sentiment on the U.S. currency, the greenback has climbed 0.8 percent this month, trimming its loss for the year to 2.7 percent. The rally hasn’t swayed many investors: hedge funds and money managers remain more net short the dollar than average over the past year, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. 
They’re positioned for more dollar losses on speculation that global central banks will soon follow the Federal Reserve in paring back post-crisis stimulus, which would strengthen their currencies relative to the U.S. Those investors might be too aggressive in anticipating that action, Bank of America says.
“The market could be wrong by pricing monetary policy convergence too early,” Athanasios Vamvakidis, a foreign-exchange strategist at the bank, wrote in a note. “We argue that inflation in the U.S. will increase this year, most likely above what markets expect, and that this will be positive for the USD.”

Investors betting on shifting policies by the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan may be disappointed by the scale and speed of changes, Vamvakidis wrote. It’s more likely that their monetary policy will continue to diverge from the Fed, since policy makers are expected to raise interest rates over the next two years. On top of that, U.S. inflation will probably outpace that of its developed-market peers. 
“If we are right about higher inflation in the U.S. compared with other G-10 economies, the USD will strengthen,” Vamvakidis wrote. The core consumer price index posted its strongest month-over-month increase in January since 2005.
Bank of America’s view may be out of consensus, but, at least for the moment, it’s looking good. The dollar rose about 0.2 percent to $1.2315 per euro and was up 0.3 percent at 107.65 yen as of 11:39 a.m. in New York."

Sales of previously owned homes in the US unexpectedly fell in January, as tight supply continued to weigh on housing activity. The Commerce Department showed existing home sales fell 3.2% in January from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 538 million units. Economists were expecting a 0.9% rise to 5.61 million homes.
The sour note on existing homes sales came on the heels of Fed jawboning as Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari suggested the central bank should continue on its current path, and avoid overreacting to one-month upbeat wage and inflation data.
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan reiterated that the Fed should gradually raise rates in 2018. Kaplan said he expects that inflation will make progress toward 2% over 2018 and the impact of tax-cuts will be seen in 2018.

The index has climbed higher after it sank to a low of 88.15 on Friday, the weakest since December 2014.
The Fed was to release the minutes of its January meeting, when it left rates on hold, later on Wednesday and a hawkish tone could reinforce expectations for a faster pace of monetary tightening this year and boost the dollar.
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said Wednesday he still thinks just two interest rate hikes this year is ""likely appropriate,"" but indicated that he is open to more if needed.
Harker also said he expected the U.S. economy to grow 2.5% this year before slowing to 2% growth next year and to below 2% in 2020.
The dollar has weakened in recent months as expectations for a faster pace of monetary tightening by the Fed have been offset by a range of bearish concerns.
Worries that large corporate tax cuts and increased government spending will negatively impact the U.S. fiscal deficit, which is projected to balloon to near $1 trillion in 2019 have pressured the currency.
The tax cuts and spending plans could backfire by overheating an already strong economy and causing an unwanted pick-up in inflation.
Expectations for a faster rate of monetary tightening outside the U.S., which would lessen the divergence between the Fed and other central banks, have also eroded the dollar’s relative yield attraction for investors.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro edged lower on Wednesday as the dollar built on its recovery from three-year lows, with higher Treasury yields supporting the greenback ahead of minutes of the Federal Reserve's most recent policy meeting.
The single currency fell 0.1 percent against the dollar, after reducing its losses following a survey that showed business confidence in the private sector of the euro zone's largest economy, Germany, hit a record high in February.
The euro, at $1.2315, is now more than 2-1/2 cents off its Friday high as investors, sensing the dollar had been oversold, bought back into the euro. 
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar (DXY) was up 0.2 percent. The U.S. currency has gained almost 2 percent since it hit three-year lows on Friday, but most strategists believe the rally is only temporary amid a longer-term structural decline. 
The dollar has fallen this year on the back of strong economic performance in other regions, where monetary policy is expected to tighten, and concerns the United States is facing a growing budget deficit.
The focus now is on Federal Reserve minutes due later on Wednesday for hints on the future pace of U.S. monetary tightening after worries about rising inflation rattled markets in recent weeks.
""Markets are particularly sensitive to inflation and we think the odds that the minutes reinforce the narrative of firming inflation are high,"" RBC Global Head of FX Strategy Elsa Lignos said.
""We think there is a high probability that the Fed moves the dots to four hikes in 2018 (from three) near-term and that the minutes could be another step in that direction."" 
Traders are also watching this week's large U.S. government debt auctions for clues to international investors' appetite for U.S. assets.
Some of the U.S. government's short-term borrowing costs rose to their highest level in more than nine years on Tuesday as it raised $179 billion in the Treasury securities market to fund spending and make debt payments.
The yen showed a muted reaction to comments from Masatsugu Asakawa, Japan's top currency diplomat, who was quoted as saying that yen's recent moves were ""one-sided"".
The dollar rose 0.3 percent to trade at 107.60 yen , helping the greenback after recent falls against the Japanese currency. The dollar earlier on Wednesday recovered to its highest level since Feb. 14 following a big slump to its weakest since late 2016.
But with analysts saying that the outlook for the dollar remains bearish, doubts for the sustainability of the dollar's bounce persist.
""I would characterize the rebound this week as more of a technical rebound. The underlying bias is still for dollar weakness,"" said Heng Koon How, head of markets strategy for United Overseas Bank (UOB) in Singapore.

Sterling traded down 0.2 percent at $1.3965  ahead of pivotal UK wages data due at 0930 GMT that analysts expect to reaffirm the Bank of England's recent more hawkish stance.

1580,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 20, 2018 05:02AM ET</span>",New Favorite Way to Short the Dollar Has Yen Replacing Euro,"(Bloomberg) -- The rally that’s made the yen 2018’s top performer among developed-market exchange rates will extend as speculators pick the Japanese currency over the euro to ride the U.S. dollar’s weakness, say analysts.
Piggybacking on an economy that’s expanded for eight straight quarters, the yen has stolen the limelight from the euro this year. The single currency’s gains have slowed after 2017 proved to be its best year in well over a decade amid bets the European Central Bank will scale back stimulus. Options traders are currently the most bullish on the yen among the Group-of-10 currencies.
“Focus is turning to the yen, with further euro-buying scope naturally being small after it was the strongest currency last year,” said Daisuke Karakama, chief market economist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Tokyo. Unlike the euro, being long in the yen isn’t yet a “crowded trade,” he said.
Leveraged funds have reduced net yen short positions for five straight weeks, the fastest pace since August, according to the latest CFTC data. In comparison, their net euro long positions declined by the most since September in the week to Feb. 13.
The yen reached 105.55 against the greenback on Friday, its strongest level since November 2016, as demand for haven assets rose amid a global stock rout. It has since weakened and was down 0.5 percent at 107.17 per dollar as of 9:15 a.m. in London.
There will always be a certain degree of long-dollar positions against the yen as Japanese margin traders and long-term investors buy the greenback on dips, said Naohiro Nomoto, manager of foreign-exchange trading at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.
‘Toward 101’
Speculators still see betting on further yen appreciation as “profitable” as they eye 105, according to Kengo Suzuki, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Longer-term charts suggest a trend forming toward 101, driven by a combination of momentum, speculators’ positions and flows.”
The yen is laying the foundations for a move toward 100 against the dollar, technical charts show. The gains last week amplified the chances of a full reversal of the slide in late 2016, when it went from 100 to 118 per dollar after the U.S. election of Donald Trump.
The dollar-yen’s recent bounce may prove short-lived as the market is coming off a week where the pair underwent significant technical damage, with major lines of defense fractured, opening a door to the 101.20-100 area.
Some money managers too are wagering the Japanese currency will strengthen further. AMP Capital Investors Ltd.’s Nader Naeimi last week added to his long yen positions, while Singapore-based Kit Trading Fund Ltd., a hedge fund, is betting it will appreciate against the U.S. and New Zealand dollars.
While the yen jumped 3.7 percent in the last two weeks alone, Japan’s Finance Minister said Thursday that it hasn’t risen too abruptly to require intervention. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has been hovering near its lowest level since December 2014, weighed down by simmering U.S. trade tensions and concern over America’s deficits.
“Markets awash with dollars from U.S. fiscal expansion are driving dollar weakness now and prompting speculators to move the target to the yen,” said Koichi Takamatsu, head of G-10 currency trading for Japan at Nomura Securities Co. in Tokyo. It’s unclear as to what would prompt Japanese authorities to step in, he said, adding that “if there is little reason to be sensitive at these levels, then it’s hard to see speculators shorting the yen.”

The dollar has been weakening in recent months, with the positive impetus from rising U.S. interest rates offset by a barrage of bearish factors.
Initially, the view that other central banks will catch up with the Federal Reserve in tightening policy this year was cited as a reason for the dollar's underperformance.
Then came comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, which stoked concerns the United States could pursue a weaker dollar policy as its trade deficit rose to highest level in almost a decade.
Mounting worries about the U.S. budget deficit, which is projected to balloon to more than $1 trillion in 2019 amid a government spending splurge and large corporate tax cuts, have also undermined the greenback.
""The dollar has been falling continuously, but with changing themes. At the moment, a projected increase in U.S. debt issuance, a reduction in Fed bond buying and bulging U.S. fiscal deficit are the main focus,"" said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank.
""That should mean U.S. long-term yields will remain high while the dollar will stay cheap,"" he said.
Economists say U.S. President Donald Trump's tax cuts and spending plans could backfire by overheating an already strong economy and causing an unwanted pick-up in inflation. 
Against the yen, the dollar edged up 0.2 percent to 106.77 yen , having bounced back from a 15-month low of 105.545 set on Friday.
Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore, said there seemed to be some short-covering in the dollar in the wake of its recent fall. 
""We've got a lot of Fed speakers...this week. I think that could be a reason why we're seeing some of the short dollar positions pared back,"" Innes said.
He added, however, that the dollar could come under pressure if this week's U.S. government bond auctions were to show sluggish investor demand for U.S. debt. 
The euro (EUR=) eased 0.2 percent to $1.2387, backing down from Friday's three-year high of $1.2556.
Euro zone finance ministers on Monday chose Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos to succeed European Central Bank Vice President Vitor Constancio in May.
The move is likely to boost the chances of German Bundesbank Governor Jens Weidmann becoming head of the ECB next year to succeed Mario Draghi in 2019, possibly giving the ECB's policy a more hawkish tilt.
Expectations that the ECB will roll back its stimulus have been the major driving force behind the euro's rally since last year.
Still, in the near term, investors may be cautious about buying the common currency given political uncertainty in the continent.
German Social Democrats (SPD) start voting in a postal ballot on Tuesday on whether the center-left party should go ahead with the agreement its leaders clinched last week to renew their power-sharing alliance with the Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives.
The results of the vote, which takes place as the SPD's support has fallen behind that of the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD), is due on March 4.

Italy will also hold a general election on March 4, which is expected to result in a hung parliament.

The US dollar steadied on Tuesday as the market went offline on Monday to observe the President’s Day while investors await the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting due tomorrow.
The greenback has been weakening in recent months, as inflation concerns amid the ideas that U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks might raise rates were cited as the main reason for the dollar's underperformance. The U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin suggested last month that a weaker dollar policy by the States could be good given the country’s trade deficit is reaching to a 10-year high.
Concerns on the country's budget deficit, which is expected to balloon to more than $1 trillion in 2019, have also been cited as headwind for the U.S. currency.
Meanwhile, the USD/JPY was trading at 106.71, up 0.13% in mid-morning Asia. Japan's finance minister Taro Aso said today that the policymakers needed to do more to achieve their 2% consumer price target. The speech came after the reappointment of Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda was reportedly “certain to be approved in parliament”, and that his aggressive quantitative easing policy would remain in place. The safe haven currency has been edging up against the dollar, prompting the Japanese central bank to hint it would intervene if the yen keeps appreciating.
The Reserve Bank of Australia released the minutes of February 2018 Monetary Policy Meeting and nothing came surprising. The Q4 wage price index and Q4 Construction Work Done, which are due Wednesday, are expected to receive some attention this week.

Trading volumes were expected to remain thin with U.S. markets closed on Monday in observance of Presidents' Day.
The greenback strengthened after data on Friday showed that U.S. homebuilding increased to more than a one-year high in January and that building permits soared to their highest level since 2007.
The upbeat report overshadowed fresh concerns over the deficit in the U.S., which is projected to climb near $1 trillion in 2019 following the recent announcement of infrastructure spending and large corporate tax cuts.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar enjoyed a small rebound on Monday as investors bought back the greenback following its plunge to three-year lows.
The U.S. currency has been hurt by a variety of factors this year, including concerns that Washington might pursue a weak dollar strategy and the perceived erosion of its yield advantage as other countries start to scale back easy monetary policy.
Confidence in the dollar has also been shaken by mounting worries over the U.S. budget deficit, which is projected to balloon to $1 trillion in 2019 amid a government spending splurge and large corporate tax cuts.
The return of risk appetite last week after a big stock market fall in early February had also been detrimental to the dollar, but on Monday the U.S. currency found its feet as some investors bought the dollar after the recent falls.
The dollar index (DXY) was up 0.1 percent at 89.215, off a low of 88.253 hit last week, which was the weakest level for the U.S. currency since December 2014. 
Against the euro, the dollar rose 0.2 percent at $1.2399 (EUR=) with traders pointing to crucial business surveys later this week that could give the single currency some more direction.
Versus the yen the dollar gained 0.3 percent to 106.58 yen  but remained down 2.3 percent this month.
""The fact that the dollar sell-off ran out of steam on Friday afternoon does not lead me to hope that it is over,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analysts said in a note. 
""The dollar bears did so well recently that there was time for profit-taking ahead of the weekend. That does not mean that they might not be selling dollar again today with renewed enthusiasm,"" the analysts said, pointing out that a lack of key data on Monday and a U.S. holiday could keep trading quiet.
The U.S. currency's outlook remains uncertain in the longer-term, strategists said, particularly as other parts of the world where central banks are tightening policy and economies are strong are looking more attractive for investors.
""Inflation worries and concerns about the U.S. fiscal and trade deficits will keep the dollar on the defensive,"" said Masashi Murata, senior strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo.
""In addition to major currencies like the yen and pound, a significant portion of the selling pressure on the dollar is expected to come from emerging currencies, which either enjoy high yields or are supported by current account surpluses.""
With the dollar higher, the pound fell 0.1 percent to $1.4011 .

The government of President Nicolas Maduro, which says the petro will help skirt financial sanctions by Washington, has scheduled the first petros sale for Tuesday. 
Skeptics say that concerns about Venezuela's financial solvency will likely limit investor interest, while the U.S. Treasury Department has warned the petro may violate sanctions against the OPEC nation. 
""On Tuesday, there will be quite a few announcements about the start of the process,"" Venezuelan Cryptocurrency Superintendent Carlos Vargas said on the sidelines of a political meeting in Caracas. 
""And there will surely be a lot of investors from Qatar, Turkey, and other parts of the Middle East, though Europeans and Americans will also participate.""
He did not elaborate.
The Venezuelan government has not provided full details about the petro. But advisers working for the government recommended that 38.4 percent of the petros should be sold in a private auction at a discount of 60 percent.
Venezuela is suffering quadruple-digit inflation and chronic shortages of food and medicine, which have spurred increased incidents of malnutrition and preventable diseases. 
Maduro says his government is the victim of an ""economic war"" led by opposition politicians with the help of the government of U.S. President Donald Trump.

Sanctions levied last year by Washington block U.S. banks and investors from acquiring newly issued Venezuelan debt, effectively preventing the struggling nation from borrowing abroad to bring in new hard currency or refinance existing debt.

1592,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 10:02AM ET</span>","Unlike the Dollar, the Euro Could Gain on Stronger Inflation","(Bloomberg) -- In financial markets where textbook correlations seem to be breaking down, traders should find they can still depend on the one between the euro and inflation.
The dollar’s counter-intuitive move south despite stronger-than-forecast U.S. price data showed investors see the currency in a medium- to long-term downtrend on the back of twin-deficit concerns. In contrast, the common currency is free of such complications. A strong euro-area inflation print on Feb. 23 should signal hawkish revisions to the European Central Bank’s price and growth projections next month, thus taking policy makers one step closer to ending their bond-buying program and ticking another box for euro bulls.
In a sign of its potential, the euro moved above $1.25 once more on Thursday as traders added long exposure having been underweight the common currency after the stock rout brought a washout in short-term positioning.
Still, it may not be all plain sailing. While the U.S.’s fiscal and current-account deficits spell more trouble for the dollar, the euro needs its path higher cleared by the ECB meeting on March 8. Even though some Governing Council members have telegraphed a need for the central bank to raise interest rates, a language shift by President Mario Draghi himself is probably needed to convince the market that September will indeed mark the end of QE.
Technically, the biggest hurdle for the euro is the resistance area near $1.2700, where the upper end of the currency’s bearish trend since its 2008 highs lies currently. A test of that area before the ECB meeting may prompt some verbal push back from officials, yet euro bulls might raise their eyebrows with disbelief once more.
A weak euro-area inflation reading could see buying interest by interbank and leveraged names around $1.2300 come under pressure, but amid this dollar-negative environment, they may hold with little effort.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar slipped to its lowest levels in more than three years against a basket of currencies on Friday, headed for its biggest weekly loss in two years as negative sentiment offset any support the greenback could take from rising Treasury yields. 
The U.S. currency has been weighed down by a variety of factors this year, including concerns that Washington might pursue a weak dollar strategy and the perceived erosion of its yield advantage as other countries start to scale back easy monetary policy.
Traders' confidence in the dollar has also been eroded by mounting worries over the United States' twin budget and current account deficits, with the latter projected to balloon to near $1 trillion in 2019 amid a government spending splurge and hefty corporate tax cuts. 
Extending the previous day's losses, the dollar's index against a group of six major currencies fell to 88.253 , the lowest since December 2014. The index was on track to lose around 2 percent on the week in its largest decline since February 2016.
Those falls have come as U.S. Treasury yields have hit four-year highs, with U.S. inflation coming in stronger than expected in January, bolstering expectations that the Federal Reserve could increase interest rates as many as four times this year.
That has left many analysts puzzled, as higher Treasury yields are normally associated with a stronger dollar.
Chris Turner, head of currency strategy at ING in London, said the breakdown of the traditional relationship between U.S. Treasuries and the dollar, particularly against the yen, could be explained by the fact that yields are rising on the back of worries over the budget deficit rather than inflation. 
""This year's rise in Treasury yields has been driven more by the term premium - that's a risk premium investors require for holding long-term debt,"" Turner said. ""International investors are requiring a concession in the dollar to hold U.S. assets because of the fiscal risk."" 
""Also, the U.S. Treasury is happy to talk fast and loose about the dollar, which I'm sure hasn't gone unnoticed by investors and other central bankers,"" Turner added. 
The dollar slipped to as low as 105.545 yen in Asian trading, its weakest in 15 months. It was on track for a weekly loss of almost 3 percent.
The reappointment of Haruhiko Kuroda as Bank of Japan governor and the nomination of BOJ executive director Masayoshi Amamiya and Waseda University professor Masazumi Wakatabe as deputy governors had little impact on the yen, although the proposed leadership trio were seen certain to keep the central bank on an ultra-loose policy path.
The euro climbed to a three-year top of $1.2556 and was poised to gain 2.4 percent this week.
The Swiss franc reached 0.9190 franc per dollar, its strongest since June 2015.

""It's difficult for the market to see the dollar rebounding, especially as decent U.S. fundamentals seem to be providing no support for the currency,"" said Shin Kadota, senior strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Tokyo.

Last month, hackers stole about $530 million from Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck Inc, in one of the biggest-ever heists of digital currency.

The Coincheck heist exposed flaws in Japan's system and raised questions over the country's dash to regulate the industry - a sharp contrast to clampdowns by countries like South Korea and China.

1599,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 04:29PM ET</span>","Bitcoin rises above $10,000, strategist sees new high by July","By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin rose above $10,000 on Thursday for the first time in more than two weeks, as investors bought back the digital currency after having fallen 70 percent from its all-time peak hit in mid-December.
Bitcoin has been buffeted this year by a series of negative headlines centering around increased scrutiny by global regulators. There has also been the incidence of hacks on exchanges, the latest being the theft of roughly $532.9 million in digital money from Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck a few weeks ago. 
The first digital currency was also affected by the risk-off mood that permeated financial markets since the beginning of the year, undermining views that bitcoin's price moves are generally uncorrelated to other asset classes. Sentiment on risk assets such as stocks and bitcoin has since improved.
Thomas Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, sees a new record peak for bitcoin by July, based on the currency's 22 corrections since 2010. 
On the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp, bitcoin rose as high as $10,234 (BTC=BTSP) and was last at $10,123.12, up nearly 7 percent on the day.

""Bitcoin's increase has coincided with the rally in global stock markets,"" said Miles Eakers, chief market analyst, at FX brokerage Centtrip, adding that a sustained break above $10,000 could open the $12,000 level.
The original cryptocurrency gained more than 1,300 percent last year, capped by a lifetime peak just shy of $20,000 on Dec. 17.
Other digital currencies also rose after posting steep losses the last few weeks. Ethereum, the second-largest by market value, was up 2.5 percent over the past 24 hours at $933.24, while the third-largest, Ripple, gained 5.3 percent to $1.15, according to cryptocurrency price tracker coinmarketcap.com.
(Graphic: Ethereum, Ripple price chart - http://reut.rs/2o5jGp5)
Fundstrat's Lee said bitcoin is still in a bull market phase even after a 70 percent selloff.
""During bull periods, bitcoin recoveries take 1.7 times the duration of the decline and implies that 85 days are needed to recover prior highs—this is July 2018,"" Lee said.
He added that 2018 will remain a strong year for cryptocurrencies, but he sees the larger and more established blockchain networks such as bitcoin and ethereum dominating again.
As bitcoin recovered, European Central Bank executive board member Yves Mersch warned in a speech in Paris on Thursday that bitcoin is not a currency, but a speculative digital asset, according to a Market News International report.
He added that because virtual currencies do not have a trusted issuer behind them, ""they may become worthless at any time."" 

Mersch said he is not surprised that virtual currencies are not widely accepted as a means of payment.

The turmoil coincides with surging trading activity, say JPMorgan and CLS Group Holdings AG, which settles global foreign-exchange transactions.
As heads of currency trading from the world’s biggest asset managers and banks gather at the TradeTech FX conference in Miami this week, they’re fixated on whether the turmoil will persist.

1602,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 08:14AM ET</span>","Dollar skids despite rising Treasury yields, hits 15-month low vs yen","By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar fell across the board on Thursday, hitting a 15-month low against the yen, as negative sentiment around the dollar outweighed a rise in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields to their highest levels in four years. 
Analysts struggled to explain the dollar's broad weakness, which came as the yield on 10-year Treasuries climbed towards 3 percent, and as stock markets and commodities steamed higher.
The greenback briefly jumped on Wednesday after data showed U.S. inflation was stronger than expected in January, bolstering expectations that the Federal Reserve could increase interest rates as many as four times this year. 
But it quickly turned lower, eventually posting its worst daily performance in three weeks against a basket of major rivals (DXY). It added to those losses on Thursday, with the index hitting a two-week low of 88.585. 
""We can't find any convincing fundamental arguments for the dollar's weakness; it's more sentiment-driven,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategist Esther Reichelt, in Frankfurt. ""I would expect a dollar correction (higher) in the medium term."" 
Some analysts suggested mounting worries over twin deficits in the United States, amid a government spending splurge and large corporate tax cuts, as a reason for dollar weakness. 
The U.S. national debt has topped $20 trillion, while the 2019 fiscal deficit is projected at near $1 trillion, including deficit-financed tax cuts and two-year spending caps that Congress passed last week. 
""The story I hear most frequently from people is it's the re-emergence of the twin deficits,"" said RBC Capital Markets head of currency strategy Adam Cole, in London, of the dollar's persistent weakness. ""There seem to be concerns on the U.S. fiscal position and what that implies for the current account."" 
Cole said news events that would normally be seen as buying opportunities for the dollar, such as Wednesday's inflation data, were only having temporarily positive effects. 
Another reason given for the dollar's falls after Wednesday's data was that U.S. consumer price growth was seen as a gauge for global inflationary pressures and that, as such, stronger growth would suggest a faster pace of monetary tightening from other central banks. 
Against the yen, the dollar skidded as much as 0.8 percent to 106.18 yen, its lowest since November 2016 . That marked a drop of 3.8 percent from its early February peak near 110.50 yen. 

The euro briefly climbed back above $1.25 for the first time in two weeks, trading up as much as half a percent on the day (EUR=), before easing back to just below that level.

1603,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 06:57AM ET</span>",Forex trading up sharply in 2018 as volatility returns,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - Foreign exchange trading volumes have risen sharply since the start of this year, new data showed on Thursday, as investors ramped up bets on a weaker dollar and uncertainty about the end of the era of cheap money stoked volatility.
Foreign exchange volatility has slumped in recent years as record levels of liquidity provided by central banks calmed markets and left investors with fewer ways to wring a profit from trading currencies.
But the continued depreciation of the dollar this year, accelerated by the U.S. Treasury Secretary's comments welcoming a weaker dollar, as well as signs that central banks will begin dialing back their stimulus, have fired up currency markets. 
Electronic trading platforms are also reporting a sharp increase in fixed income trading volumes.
CLS, a major settler of trades in the FX market, said the average daily traded volume submitted to it had risen to $1.805 trillion in January, up 24 percent from a year earlier and up 15.6 percent from December.
""This year we've observed a much more substantial increase as FX volatility has risen. For the last six months of 2017, we saw a broader trend of year-on-year increases...but in January the market has really taken off,"" said David Puth, CLS's CEO.
CLS said trading had accelerated further in early February, possibly as the equity sell-off starting in late January increased volatility even more.
In the first four days of last week, Feb. 5 to Feb. 8, volumes rose by a further 14 percent over January's numbers to $2.054 trillion, CLS said.
Currency market swings, however, have been far more measured than in stocks, with volatility still below long-term average levels.
Thomson Reuters said this week that FX trading volumes on its platforms had hit a record high in January, the first month following the introduction of sweeping European regulations, known as MiFID II or Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II.
Average daily volumes topped $432 billion in January compared with an average of more than $407 billion, the company said.
The new European rules, designed to increase market transparency, have also driven electronic fixed income trading volumes.
MarketAxess, one of the bigger platforms, said this month that average daily trading volumes hit a record $7.3 billion in January, up 22 percent from a year earlier.
RISING VOL
The uptick in volatility will be welcomed by investment bank trading desks, which can make more money when prices swing wider but have faced years of calmer markets. 
""January was active because it was the start of the next phase of the dollar’s depreciation, and then you had the ECB,"" JP Morgan's Head of Currencies and Emerging Markets Trading in EMEA, Stephen Jefferies, told Reuters, referring to minutes from the European Central Bank that raised speculation of monetary tightening in the euro zone. 
Still, Jefferies noted that volatility in the world's most traded currency pair, the euro/dollar, remains below its long-term average even after the recent rise. 
When stocks tumbled earlier this month, Jefferies said currencies did not move as much as many had expected, suggesting ""positions might not have been as big as you thought"".
But with central banks expected to accelerate unwinding of their balance sheets as inflation expectations rise, currency volatility is set to rise.

""This shift in central bank thinking has some serious implications for currencies as well,"" said Neil Jones, London-based head of hedge fund currency sales at Mizuho bank.

1604,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 05:15AM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar Remains Broadly Lower Vs. Other Majors,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was broadly lower against other major currencies on Thursday, as Wednesday's mixed U.S. data sparked uncertainty over the pace of future U.S. rate hikes and as a rise in inflation sent U.S. bond yields sharply higher.
The greenback initially strengthened after the U.S. Commerce Department reported on Wednesday that consumer prices rose more than expected in January by 0.5%. Year-over-year, consumer prices increased 2.1% higher, beating expectations for a gain of 1.9%.
Rising inflation would be a catalyst to push the Federal Reserve toward raising interest rates at a faster pace than currently expected.
The dollar's gains were short-lived however, as expectations for a faster pace of rate hikes drove the benchmark 10-Year Treasury yield to a four-year high of 2.928%. If the 10-year Treasury yield reaches 3% it could trigger further market volatility, analysts say.
In addition, a separate report on Wednesday showing that U.S. retail sales fell 0.3% in January, compared to expectations for a 0.2% rise, sparked concerns that the Fed could struggle to raise rates quickly enough to offset inflation pressures.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.30% at 88.64 by 05:15 a.m. ET (09:15 GMT), the lowest since February 2.
USD/JPY was down 0.54% at 106.41, the weakest level since November 11, 2016.
Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Thursday that he doesn't see current yen moves as being strong or weak enough to warrant intervention, adding that there was no plan now to respond to exchange rate moves.
The safe-haven Swiss franc was als higher, with USD/CHF sliding 0.39% to 0.9257.
Elsewhere, the euro and the pound were stronger, with EUR/USD up 0.28% at 1.2484 and with GBP/USD gaining 0.44% to 1.4059.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars were higher, with AUD/USD rising 0.29% to 0.7950 and with NZD/USD climbing 0.43% to 0.7398.
Earlier Thursday, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said that the number of employed people increased by 16,000 in January, beating expectations for a 15.300 gain.
The unemployment rate ticked down to 5.5% last month from 5.6% in December.

USD/JPY was down 0.72% to 106.23 by 03:15 AM ET (08:15 AM GMT), the weakest level since Nov. 11, 2016. The dollar has fallen more than 2% against the Japanese currency in February.
Expectations for a continued expansion in the U.S. budget deficit pressured the dollar lower as bond yields rose. A recovery in risk appetite also weighed on the greenback.
The U.S. currency attracted safe haven demand during the stock market downturn seen earlier this month, although it had fallen to a three-year low in January.
On Wednesday, the dollar initially climbed after data showing a stronger-than-expected increase in U.S. inflation in January bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates four times this year.
But the dollar’s gains were short lived and the greenback turned broadly lower in spite of the change in expectations for U.S. rate hikes.
Expectations for a faster rate of rate hikes drove the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to a four-year high of 2.928%. If the 10-year Treasury yield reaches 3% it could trigger further market volatility, analysts say.
The steep drop in the dollar against the yen in recent sessions has fueled expectations for a verbal intervention by Japanese officials.
On Thursday Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said that he doesn't see current yen moves as being strong or weak enough to warrant intervention, adding that there was no plan now to respond to exchange rate moves.
Investors tend to seek out the yen in times of market turbulence as the currency is backed by Japan's current account surplus, which offers it more resilience than currencies of deficit-running countries.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.35% to 88.60 after losing 0.76% on Wednesday.
The euro pushed higher, with EUR/USD rising 0.4% to 1.2499 after climbing 0.94% in the previous session.

1608,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>",Fresh Dose of Inflation Fails to Cure Dollar's Deep-Rooted Ills,"(Bloomberg) -- A strong inflation print is what had been missing to re-energize dollar bulls, right? Well, not quite. 
The dollar did rise as U.S. consumer prices advanced more than anticipated in January, but its gains were short-lived. One only had to look at the yen, which ceded little ground to the greenback after the data even as other currencies retreated and Treasury yields surged, to know the dollar’s problems may be more deep-rooted.
There’s a “very profound” disruption of long-standing correlations behind the moves seen in the dollar-yen, according to Jens Nordvig, the CEO and founder of Exante Data.
“The FX market has been very surprised by some of the breakdowns in correlations we’ve seen,” Nordvig said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Feb. 13, noting that the dollar-yen exchange rate has decoupled from U.S. interest rates. “The really big story is that the dollar is tanking.”
Traders’ enthusiasm to buy the dollar against other currencies after the data proved fleeting as well. The Bloomberg dollar index reversed earlier gains to trade 0.6 percent lower at 13:35 p.m. in New York and continued to tread water even as the 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 2.90 percent, a fresh four-year high. The greenback has now dropped more than 3 percent since the beginning of the year, with the biggest loss among Group-of-10 currencies recorded against the yen at more than 5 percent.
Dollar bulls may be poised for more pain as investors reassess the outlook for the U.S. economy amid rising inflation and growing budget deficits. Currency markets are reckoning with an “inflection point”, where macro fundamentals point to further gains in the yen and the euro, according to Mazen Issa, a foreign-exchange strategist at TD Securities.
“Longer term, macro fundamentals tend to gain more credence here and investors put more emphasis on current account surplus currencies,” said Issa. “Certainly the yen and the euro are at the top of the list when it comes to that metric.”

Investing.com - The weakening U.S. dollar is causing friction between the European Union and the Trump administration.There's growing concern in Europe that the U.S. is seeking a weaker dollar to make American goods more competitive abroad.The concern comes even after President Trump said he wanted a strong dollar following controversial comments from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin that a weaker dollar was good for the U.S.The dollar is down about 3% against the euro this year, after a double-digit loss in 2017.Concern has been voiced by European Central Bank council member Ewald Nowotny recently.Nowotny, who also heads the Austrian central bank, said the U.S. is putting downward pressure on the dollar through its policies and wants to keep it low.Analysts say the Trump administration's massive tax cut is forcing the government to issue more debt, which makes the dollar less attractive and thus depresses its value.President Trump has also complained about the nation's huge trade deficits with major trading partners, such as China, Japan and Germany."
1611,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 09:00AM ET</span>","As Iran rial hits record low, police crack down on money changers","LONDON (Reuters) - Iranian police cracked down on unlicensed money changers in Tehran on Wednesday, arresting around 100 traders, Tehran's police chief told local media, in a sign that authorities are concerned about speculators pushing the rial to record lows.
After a month of surveillance, around 90 money changers were arrested in 10 minutes in the streets of Tehran, police chief General Hossein Rahimi told Fars News Agency on Wednesday.
News of the crackdown helped to bolster the value of the rial, at least temporarily, and it rebounded to around 48,220 to the dollar on Wednesday. It had reached a record low around 50,000 in the free market this week, compared with 47,800 last week and 35,570 in mid-September.
Since last year, the central bank has been engineering a gradual depreciation of the rial to compensate for Iran's high inflation and to help to make exports more competitive.
But the drop has accelerated in the past few months, creating a problem for authorities, who have just contained a wave of popular protests against economic hardship and corruption. Too weak a rial could increase discontent by boosting inflation, which is running at nearly 10 percent.
The rial has been hurt by concern about Iran's agreement with world powers to curb its nuclear program in return for the lifting of most international sanctions. U.S. President Donald Trump said last month ""disastrous flaws"" in the agreement had to be fixed or Iran would face a U.S. exit.
Aggressive purchases of dollars by currency speculators appear to have sped up the rial's decline; central bank governor Valiollah Seif warned speculators last month not to bet against the currency, but that did not change the trend.
""The detainees, driven by greed, were attempting to disrupt the market and economic order,"" Rahimi told Fars. ""The judicial system should firmly punish them.""
He said more than 10 currency exchanges were shut down, and 16 received official warnings.

1612,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 08:37AM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar Hits Day’s Highs as U.S. Inflation Rises,"Investing.com - The dollar rose to the day’s highs against a basket of the other major currencies on Wednesday after data showing that U.S. inflation rose more strongly than expected in January.
The annual rate of inflation rose to 2.1% in January and to 1.8% on a core basis the Department of Labor said.
Consumer prices rose 0.5% from a month earlier and to 0.3% on a core basis.
The inflation data had been hotly anticipated after fears over rising price pressures and thus a faster rate of interest rate increases triggered the initial selloff in global equity markets two weeks ago.
U.S. futures turned sharply lower as the inflation data rekindled fears that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more quickly than expected, while European markets lost their early gains.
At the same time, a separate report showed that U.S. retail sales fell 0.3% in January after a 0.4% gain in December.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.37% to 89.93 by 08:40 AM ET (13:40 GMT).
The U.S. currency attracted safe haven demand during the stock market downturn seen earlier this month, although it had fallen to a three-year low in January.
The euro fell to the day’s lows against the dollar, with EUR/USD losing 0.46% to 1.2293 after earlier rising to a one-week high of 1.2393.
The dollar remained weaker against the yen, with USD/JPY last at 107.46 after slumping to a 15-month low of 106.84 overnight as investors remained on edge ahead of the inflation numbers.
Investors tend to seek out the yen in times of market turbulence as the currency is backed by Japan's current account surplus, which offers it more resilience than currencies of deficit-running countries.

1615,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 11:53PM ET</span>","Dollar hits 15-month low vs. yen, sentiment shaky before U.S. inflation data","By Shinichi Saoshiro
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar slid to a 15-month low against the yen on Wednesday, as investors remained on edge ahead of key U.S. inflation numbers later in the day, underscoring fragile risk sentiment following the recent shakeout in equity markets. 
The U.S. currency was 0.8 percent lower at 106.960 yen after plumbing 106.840, its weakest since November 2016, with a drop in Japanese shares increasing demand for the yen which is often sought in times of market turmoil.
The dollar had enjoyed a brief respite against its Japanese peer overnight as U.S. shares managed to gain for the third successive session on Tuesday following last week's sharp downturn. But it began to wobble again as Japan's Nikkei surrendered early gains and fell to four-month lows on Wednesday.
Near-term focus was on how far the dollar would slide against the yen after falling below 107.320, which was seen as a key technical level, with the market paying little heed to jawboning by Japanese officials.
Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga warned on Wednesday that stable currency market moves were ""extremely important"", signaling concern over recent yen gains that could undermine a strengthening economic recovery. 
""Trend-following macro funds see the yen appreciating further. There are no fresh factors, but for speculators, anything that appears yen-supportive is welcome, even in hindsight,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior forex strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
Lingering expectations the Bank of Japan would follow the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank in eventually normalizing monetary policy have helped the yen appreciate, even though the Japanese central bank has reiterated that it intends to stick to its ultra-easy stance.
""Many trend-following players have a scenario drawn up in which the BOJ follows a monetary policy normalization cycle,"" said Koji Fukaya, president at FPG Securities in Tokyo. 
""However, following such a scenario and driving the yen higher means that the BOJ would be even more determined to stick to an easy policy and prevent the currency from appreciating and shield the domestic stock market.""
Volatility in the risk asset markets have been a key driver of currencies and investors now await U.S. January inflation data due at 1330 GMT, with the indicator seen either upsetting the equity market's fragile recovery or clearing the way for additional gains.
Wall Street shares slumped from record highs scaled late in January after Treasury yields rose to four-year highs, largely because of inflation worries.
Seasonally adjusted U.S. consumer price index data is expected to show inflation of 0.3 percent in January versus 0.1 percent in December.
The dollar's fall against the yen comes against the currency's broader declines against a number of peers.
The U.S. currency attracted demand during the global market tumult seen earlier this month, although it had fallen to a three-year low against a basket of currencies in January.
The dollar was weighed by factors including the prospect of the United States pursuing a weak dollar strategy and the greenback enjoying less interest rate advantage as other countries part with easy monetary policy. 
The dollar index against a group of six major currencies was down 0.3 percent at 89.446 after dropping nearly 0.6 percent overnight.
The euro added to overnight gains and last traded up 0.25 percent at $1.2383 after going to a one-week high of $1.2392.
Against the yen, however, the common currency fell 0.6 percent to 132.365 yen.
The Swiss franc rose 0.35 percent to 0.9313 franc per dollar and the pound added 0.2 percent to $1.3919.
The New Zealand dollar gained 0.65 percent to $0.7320 after a Reserve Bank of New Zealand's quarterly survey showed business managers forecast annual inflation to average 2.11 percent over the coming two years, from 2.02 percent in the previous survey.

The Australian dollar was 0.2 percent higher at $0.7877.

1616,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 11:01PM ET</span>",U.S. Dollar Sell-Off Continues As Yen Touches 15-Month High,"Investing.com – The dollar fell to its 15-month low against the yen on Wednesday, as investors remained cautious ahead of the U.S. inflation data coming out later today.
The yen received some focus today as it gained strength against the dollar in morning trading Asia Wednesday amid the release of a slower-than-expected GDP growth, while many await the U.S. CPI index that might hint earlier interest rate hike.
Japan released Wednesday morning its GDP growth data for the fourth quarter of 2017 that failed to meet market expectations but still marked an eighth consecutive quarter of growth. In the three months to December, Japan’s economy grew 0.5% YoY and 0.1% on quarter, both below expectations of 0.9% and 0.1% growth. Despite failing to meet expectations, the data marks one of the longest growth streaks in recent years for Japan.
Japan chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga's speech at a news conference caught some attention as he warned excess volatility and disorderly currency moves could hurt economies, signalling concern over recent yen gains.
“Currency market stability is extremely important. The government will closely watch currency market moves with a sense of urgency,” said Suga.
The dollar weakened against the Japanese yen, with USD/JPY down 0.70% to 107.06 in mid-morning.
The US dollar index that tracks the dollar against a basket of trade weighted currencies was down 0.11% to 89.60 at 10 pm EST – mid-morning in China.
The next focus for forex traders now is U.S. January consumer price index data expected at 8:30 am EST Wednesday, after the close of Asian markets. The CPI in January last year rose 1.7% compared to 1.8% December. High inflation numbers could signal faster than expected interest rate hikes from the US Federal Reserve and more downward pressure on the dollar.
Meanwhile in China, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), set the fix rate for the yuan, the mid-point from which the currency is allowed to trade, at 6.3428 against dollar on Wednesday, almost flat from Tuesday’s 6.3247.
The PBOC also appointed JPMorgan as a yuan clearing bank.
The dollar was trading lower against the Chinese yuen at mid-morning, with USD/CNY down 0.02% to 6.3396.
The greenback continued to weaken against the Aussie dollar, with AUD/USD up 0.28% to 0.7880.
Australia’s Westpac consumer confidence index for February recorded a drop of 2.3% and traders will now be looking for cues from employment data due out Thursday.
The country’s economic growth has lagged in recent months and the reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has yet to announce plans to boost interest rates but business confidence data earlier this week hit an all month high, according to a survey by National Australia Bank."
1617,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 10:30PM ET</span>",Chinese yuan to weaken if Fed sticks to policy tightening path: Reuters poll,"By Vivek Mishra
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Chinese yuan will erase most of its substantial gains so far in 2018 against the dollar over the coming year, a Reuters poll showed, provided the U.S. Federal Reserve delivers at least three interest rate hikes this year, as most economists expect.
The yuan hit a 2-1/2 year high last week and is up nearly 3 percent for the year so far, driven mainly by a sell-off in the dollar and partially on generally higher fixings of the official guidance rate by the People's Bank of China (PBOC).
The Chinese currency is expected to weaken to 6.41 per dollar in six months and then to 6.44 in a year, according to the poll of more than 60 foreign exchange strategists taken over the past week. It is currently trading around 6.33.
However, the range of forecasts and consensus compared to the previous poll suggest analysts are not convinced about a rebound in the dollar. That was in line with a Reuters poll on major currencies published last week. 
After falling nearly 10 percent last year, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, hit its lowest since December 2014 of 88.671 on Feb. 1. 
But it has recovered some on the recent rise in U.S. Treasury yields.
""The recent strong rise in U.S. wages has triggered fears of higher inflation on the markets, to the benefit of the dollar. We see a good chance of it gaining further ground, which would tend to push up USD/CNY further as well,"" said Thu Lan Nguyen, FX analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), in a note to clients.
""We expect CNY to slightly depreciate again over the coming quarters against USD, due to weaker growth prospects for the Chinese economy.""
The Chinese economy is expected to grow 6.5 percent this year, the slowest annual expansion in 27 years, and 6.3 percent in 2019, a separate Reuters poll found in January. 
Despite that, a few currency strategists expect the yuan to gain over the coming year, including the most optimistic call for it to strengthen sharply to 5.65, a level not seen since November 1992.
More than one-quarter of the poll participants forecast the yuan to strengthen over the coming year to above the 2-1/2 year high hit last week.
""We are constructive on the CNY due to positive fundamentals and downtrend in the USD. However, in the short term, USD may rebound further as risk aversion dominates,"" said Irene Cheung, senior strategist for Asia at ANZ.
""We forecast further CNY appreciation as capital flows have become more balanced and could shift towards a resumption of inflows as foreign demand for onshore China assets increase.""
The PBOC pledged last week to maintain a prudent and neutral monetary policy in 2018 and said it will deepen market-based interest rate reforms, fend off systemic financial risks and keep the yuan stable this year. 
According to a separate Reuters poll on currency positioning taken last week, bullish bets on the Chinese yuan dipped for the first time since December. 
Investors also trimmed bullish bets on the Indian rupee to their lowest since January 2017.
The Indian rupee, which gained 6 percent in 2017, is down nearly 1 percent this year against the dollar and is now expected to trade around where it was on Tuesday at various points over the coming 12 months.
The consensus was for the rupee to trade at 64.00 per dollar in six months and in a year, from about 64.27 on Tuesday.
The poll was taken after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept its main repo rate on hold and retained its ""neutral"" stance at its meeting last week. 
""The fair value of the rupee is likely to worsen this year, albeit marginally,"" said Tushar Arora, senior economist at HDFC Bank.
""(A) rise in domestic inflation, pressure on the current account deficit, and moderation in FII (foreign institutional investors) flows on account of global monetary policy tightening are some of the factors that could lead to a bit of depreciation in the rupee.""

1618,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 10:30PM ET</span>","Yen Climbs to 15-Month High, Hitting Japan Stocks: Markets Wrap","(Bloomberg) -- The yen climbed to a 15-month high as traders probed Japanese officials’ tolerance for appreciation, hurting the nation’s stocks in what was otherwise a mixed session for Asian equities Wednesday ahead of a key U.S. inflation report.
Treasuries also advanced, along with gold, giving the moves the flavor of a shift to havens. Futures on the S&P 500 Index were little changed, as was the MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks. Shares rose in Hong Kong and Seoul, and fluctuated in Shanghai before a week-long Lunar New Year holiday. Volatility lingered, albeit down from the extremely elevated levels reached last week.
Japan’s currency climbed to its strongest since November 2016, when the yen was sold off as investors anticipated U.S. fiscal stimulus would boost American interest rates. Japanese officials have offered muted expressions of concern at this point, with Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga saying Wednesday morning simply that the Abe administration will continue to watch market moves and that it’s very important to have a stable currency.
While U.S. equities are recouping some of the $2 trillion wiped out in the rout last week, Japanese stocks are 10 percent below their January highs, with the Topix index trading at a four-month low. GMO’s James Montier said U.S. stocks were ""obscenely overvalued,"" citing the Shiller price-earnings ratio, which shows that U.S. stocks are at the second-most-expensive level ever, topped only by the technology bubble of the late 1990s. He also referenced a recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) survey showing the highest level ever of fund managers saying the market suffers from “excessive valuation.”
American consumer-price data due Wednesday could give some clues on where markets are heading, with investors assessing the outlook for inflation and what it means for the trajectory of U.S. monetary policy. New Chairman Jerome Powell suggested the Federal Reserve would forge ahead with gradual rate increases even as it keeps an eye on financial system risks following the recent equity rout.

Dollar-denominated assets such as gold are sensitive to moves in the dollar – A fall in the dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of foreign currency and thus, increases demand for the precious metal.

1625,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 05:58AM ET</span>",Sterling climbs after UK inflation beats expectations,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling strengthened on Tuesday as data showed British inflation unexpectedly stayed close to its highest levels in six years in January, firming up investors' bets that the Bank of England will raise interest rates again in May.
The BoE surprised financial markets last week by indicating that rates could move up faster than previously expected, as the Bank wanted to bring inflation back to its target of 2 percent within two years rather than three.
This prompted markets to price in as much as a 70 percent chance of a quarter-point rise in interest rates by May, and a roughly 50 percent chance of a further increase in rates to 1 percent by the end of the year - a level last seen in 2009.
Tuesday's numbers showed consumer price inflation (CPI) held at an annual rate of 3.0 percent in January, unchanged from the month before and above a consensus forecast of 2.9 percent.
""This adds further weight to the case for higher interest rates sooner rather than later,"" wrote  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) economist Ben Brettell in a note to clients.
""It seems domestically driven inflation could seamlessly take over from the sterling-related price rises we’ve seen since the Brexit vote. If this is the case, some tightening of monetary policy looks increasingly appropriate.""

The pound skidded to a three-week low against the dollar on Friday after the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned a transition deal was far from assured.
Those comments, as well as broad strength in the dollar amid a sharp stock market sell-off, handed sterling its biggest weekly falls since October, as investors worried that Britain could leave the European Union in a disorderly manner.

Analysts said British wages data due next week, as well as a major upcoming speech by the prime minister on Brexit, would be the next determinants of sterling's direction.

1628,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 04:05AM ET</span>",Euro gains as stronger stocks hurt dollar; yen hits five-month high,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro gained on Tuesday as gains in global equity markets encouraged traders to sell the dollar and tiptoe back into riskier assets.
The dollar was down as much as half a percent against a basket of currencies, reversing some of its gains of last week, when it enjoyed its performance since 2016.
""It's an interesting combination of the return of risk appetite and U.S. bond yields also dragging the dollar,"" said Alvin Tan, London-based FX strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), adding there was little euro-specific news to push the single currency higher.
A sharp sell-off in stock markets last week drove traders to unwind one of the most popular bets of the year - buying the euro on expectations the European Central Bank will scale back its stimulus later this year amid a strong recovery in the bloc's economy.
Although many market players remain bullish on the euro, the currency lacks clear catalysts for further gains as a March election in Italy and a fragile coalition deal in Germany create an uncertain political backdrop.
Though risk appetite appears to be recovering, emerging market currencies that sold off last week failed to make much headway, with the Turkish lira , Mexican Peso  and Russia's rouble (RUB=) all treading water.
The commodity-linked Australian  and Canadian  dollars were also trading flat. 
""Market sentiment is still fragile,"" Tan said.
YEN HITS FIVE-MONTH HIGH
The dip back into riskier assets initially helped to lift the dollar against the yen but the upbeat mood quickly disappeared when traders saw Japanese shares failing to maintain hefty gains.
The yen, which enjoyed a bounce against the dollar last week thanks to its reputation as a relative safe haven, hit a five-month high.
The greenback fell 0.9 percent to 107.655 yen  as the Nikkei (N225) erased a 1.4 percent intraday gain to end down 0.7 percent at a four-month closing low.
Prospects of higher inflation globally have rattled investors this month and have helped drive equity market falls.
Higher inflation could prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve to tighten policy faster than expected. Alternatively, if the Fed fails to act fast enough and falls behind the curve on policy, it could end up pushing up long-term bond yields. In either scenario, traders worry that U.S. economic growth could be hampered.
There were some indications such fears are beginning to subside, with the MSCI's all-country world index (MIWD00000PUS) rising 1.2 percent.
""I think markets will remain shaky until (Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome) Powell's congressional testimony on Feb. 28. Markets will try to test him until they hear his thinking,"" said a trader at a U.S. bank.

Investors tend to seek out the yen in times of market turbulence as the currency is backed by Japan's current account surplus, which offers it more resilience than currencies of deficit-running countries.

Sterling also pushed higher, with GBP/USD rising 0.15% to 1.3859. Demand for the pound continued to be underpinned by growing expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates again in the coming months, despite economic uncertainty over Brexit.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro edged higher on Monday and the dollar fell back, as a bounce in equity markets ended a strong run for the greenback in which nervous investors had rushed to reverse their bets against the U.S. currency.
Some appetite for risk-taking crept back into currency markets after last week's slump, helping higher-yielding emerging market currencies as well as commodity-linked currencies like the Australian and Canadian dollars, although the gains were limited.
The dollar was down 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies, erasing some of the gains last week when the dollar enjoyed its best weekly performance since 2016.
Asian share markets found a semblance of calm on Monday as S&P futures extended their bounce, while European indexes opened higher as volatility eased back following last week's spike.
The sell-off last week spilled over into currencies, forcing many traders to unwind their bets on a stronger euro and to exit higher yielding but riskier currencies and seek safety in the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. 
The moves in foreign exchange markets were far more muted than in other asset classes, however. 
""We have a little bit of risk appetite back into the market,"" said Nordea Markets currency strategist Niels Christensen, adding that the U.S. consumer price inflation numbers due on Wednesday would be the decisive data for direction this week. 
""The market is still extremely long positioned on the euro. These investors will be quick to reduce their positions,"" he said. 
The euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.2275 after earlier hitting a day's high of $1.2298. The euro suffered its worst week since November 2016 last week. 
Against the yen, the dollar also eased but it paused above a five-month low. 
The dollar fell 0.1 percent to 108.69 yen, remaining above Friday's trough of 108.05 yen, its lowest level since Sept. 11. The dollar last week fell nearly 1.3 percent against the yen.
The yen tends to attract demand in times of market stress as the currency is backed by Japan's current account surplus, which offers it more resilience than currencies of deficit-running countries. 
Reports late last week that the Japanese government had decided to nominate Haruhiko Kuroda for a rare second term as Bank of Japan governor when his current one expires in April, signaling the BOJ's ultra-loose monetary policy will remain in place, were seen as a factor that could potentially weigh on the yen and temper its gains.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government is to present Kuroda's nomination to parliament later this month, a person briefed on the matter said on Saturday.
Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore, said on Monday: ""It's not as if the dollar is going to rise sharply against the yen in the next couple of days just because Kuroda is set to be re-appointed"". 
""But once the market settles down, focus will probably return to differences in monetary policy... and that could give the dollar an upward bias against the yen,"" he said.

1646,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",BoE's Cunliffe warns EU over curbing cross-border funds after Brexit,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Curbing the ability of asset managers located in Britain to run funds based in the European Union after Brexit would be costly and inefficient and could fragment markets, Bank of England Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said on Friday.
The bloc's securities watchdog ESMA published guidance last May on how UK-based asset managers could continue to run funds in the bloc after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019.
It says there must be enough ""substance"" or senior management on the ground in the EU country where the fund is listed so that not all key tasks are delegated back to Britain.
The aim is to stop some EU countries competing by offering easy licensing conditions to UK-based asset managers wanting to open a hub in the bloc after Brexit.
Asset managers fear this will mean having to move staff to the bloc after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019.
Cunliffe said that if the EU's move was motivated by a desire to pull activity and risk back within its boundaries after Brexit, then this ""could act as the harbinger of fragmentation to come"".
""That would raise the cost and reduce the efficiency of market-based intermediation of savings in the EU and, if it led to wider effects, further afield,"" Cunliffe said in a speech to an asset management forum in California.
Cunliffe quoted figures to show that managers in countries elsewhere in the world, like the United States, managed more funds in the EU than managers in Britain did.
Over half the $8.5 trillion of assets being managed in Britain are pensions, insurance and investments of British citizens, Cunliffe said.
Less than 20 percent of assets managed in Britain are domiciled in the rest of the EU in centers like Dublin and Luxembourg.
Cunliffe said Brexit itself is not going to lead to a ""huge scale"" regulatory risks for the bloc, though fund managers need to delegate responsibly.
""Delegation must not be allowed to become devolution,"" he said.
U.S. fund managers have said the EU risks closing itself off to outside expertise and could prompt retaliatory measures.
Alarm among asset managers increased after the EU's executive European Commission proposed last year to give the ESMA a say over delegation arrangements.
This is currently the purview of national regulators, and the proposals face opposition in some EU states.
ESMA has said there is no intention to scrap the delegation model.

Cunliffe did not address the outlook for British monetary policy in the text of the speech provided by the BoE.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.25% to 90.44. The dollar was set to record its biggest weekly gain in more than a year. 
GBP/USD fell 0.93% to $1.3784. 
Sterling came under heavy pressure as a planned meeting to discuss the UK’s future relations with the EU was cancelled reportedly due to “diary constraints.” Negative sentiment on sterling intensified as Barnier appeared to take a tough stance on Brexit negotiations, demanding that the UK apply new EU Rules in a possible transition period: 
“The U.K. asked for this period,” Barnier said of the transitional deal. “If we maintain the economic status quo, we maintain the integrity of the single market and the application of the rules that are in place to all those who benefit from it.”
Brexit related developments are expected to continue to dominate direction in sterling. Action Economics said it expects that the backdrop of how Brexit evolves together with the action of other central banks concerning monetary policy will be key for sterling direction.

1650,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 07:34AM ET</span>",Euro set for worst week since 2016 as dollar extends rally,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Friday to extend its recent gains while the euro was headed for its worst weekly performance since Nov. 2016 after the global stock market sell-off squeezed investors positioned for a weaker greenback.
Betting on a weaker dollar versus the euro has been one of the most popular trades this year, with a resurgent European economy fuelling expectations the European Central Bank will shrink its balance sheet sooner than expected.
After earlier rising, the euro slipped and was down 0.1 percent at $1.2234 at 1215 GMT, bringing weekly losses to 1.7 percent. So far this year, the euro remains 2 percent higher. It hit a three-year high of $1.2538 in late January.
More broadly, the dollar against a basket of currencies was up 0.3 percent and has now gained 1.4 percent <.DOXY> this week, the best performance since November 2016. The U.S. currency remains down 1.8 percent this year, however. 
Stephen Gallo, European Head of FX Strategy at BMO Capital Markets, said the sell-off ""in equity markets and risk assets has led to a healthy correction in FX markets, in the short dollar positions getting squeezed."" 
Gallo said that unless there was a fundamental shift in the health of the global economy, which this week's downturn in equity markets did not imply, the dollar remained in a ""multi-year downward trend.
""Don't let this take your eye off the longer-term picture of dollar weakness,"" he said.
The dollar recovered some ground against the yen in early European trading after earlier falling to near four-month lows  as investors sought out safety in the Japanese currency. 
The slump in stock prices continued in Asia and Europe on Friday.
The U.S. House of Representatives joined the Senate in approving a bill to end an overnight federal shutdown, averting serious interruption of the government's business that could have hit sentiment towards the dollar.
REDUCING RISK
Before this week's market mayhem, one of the most popular trades in the currency market was to buy the euro on expectations of unwinding of stimulus by the ECB and to sell the yen on the view that the Bank of Japan will be the last to exit from its ultra-loose policy.
Many market players are closing existing positions rather than making new bets as they look to reduce risk exposure during the pick up in volatility. 
Equity market volatility has surged this week, and while foreign exchange markets have remained far calmer, the carnage this week has upended some popular trades. 
UniCredit said it was closing a short position in the euro versus the Norwegian krone after the sell-off penalized the previously buoyant currency and Norwegian price growth in January came in weaker than expected. 
""We remain constructive on the Norwegian krone given its still-huge undervaluation according to our models...but will probably wait for more evidence of rising inflation at home and more-stable markets before proposing this trade again,"" UniCredit strategists said in a note.
The euro was up 1.3 percent at 9.8275 (EURNOK=) after the krone earlier weakened to its lowest level since December. 
Emerging market currencies as well as commodity-linked currencies like the Canadian  and Australian  dollars, which have enjoyed a strong run against the U.S. currency, have also been hit by this week's turmoil. 
The Swiss franc (EURCHF=), another currency investors turn to as a perceived safe haven, hit a near four-month high against the euro at 1.1460 francs before falling back to trade at 1.1475.

1651,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 07:31AM ET</span>",Pound Falls as EU Warns Brexit Transition Period Not a Given,"(Bloomberg) -- The pound fell and gilts rallied as the European Union’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said that a Brexit transition period wasn’t a given if disagreements with the U.K. persisted.
Sterling headed for a weekly loss as Barnier struck a downbeat tone following the latest round of Brexit talks, saying that disagreements remained on the role of the European Court of Justice in the deal and that citizens’ rights was a “major issue” for the EU side.

1652,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 06:03AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Friday,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Friday, February 9:
1. U.S. Congress passes bill to end government shutdown
The U.S. Congress managed to pass a two-year budget agreement early Friday that ended a brief partial government shutdown that began at midnight when lawmakers missed a funding deadline.
The agreement will boost federal spending by almost $300 billion and suspend the debt ceiling for a year and was passed in a 240-186 House vote following an earlier approval by the Senate (71-28).
Since U.S. President Donald Trump had already promised to sign the bill, the measure will restore funding before most government workers arrive at their jobs and financial markets open.
2. Stocks set to rebound after record rout
This week has been a rough one for global stocks, their worst decline since 2011, with the selloff in the last U.S. session causing the Dow to chalk up its third loss of more than 500 points in the last five days, sending the blue-chip index on track to register its worst weekly decline since October 2008.
Both the Dow and S&P 500 have officially entered correction territory as both indices are off more than 10% since their January 26 highs.
Increases in Treasury yields on the back of strong economic data have been cited as a reason for capital rotation out of equities and into bonds.
For the moment, U.S. futures last pointed to a bounce at the open on Friday, with traders apparently breathing a sigh of relief. At 6:00AM ET (11:00GMT), the blue-chip Dow futures gained 128 points, or 0.53%, S&P 500 futures rose 19 points, or 0.17%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 45 points, or 0.72%.
Earlier, Asian stock markets felt the spread of panic, following in Wall Street’s footsteps. Of note, China’s Shanghai Composite tumbled 4% at the close, its largest decline in nearly two years, pulling off a 6% plunge since at the height of the Asian selloff. Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei 225 also ended with notable losses of 2.3%.
However, European shares managed to post more limited losses on Thursday, shaking off the sharper selloffs seen on Wall Street and Asia, even as U.S. futures pointed to a slight recovery.
3. U.S. 10-year Treasury yield creeps back towards key 3% level
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes on Friday crept back towards a four-year high on Friday after the U.S. Congress passed a roughly $300 billion spending bill to end the government shutdown.
Analysts have been concerned about the psychological 3% level for 10-year Treasuries, suggesting it could be a trigger for investors to move money out of equities and into the safe haven asset.
Experts have suggested that strong economic data has increased risk of inflation, prompting fears that the Federal Reserve would be forced to take a more aggressive stance in tightening monetary policy.
The 10-year yield was last up 1 basis point to 2.858% on Friday after earlier losses, moving back towards the nearly four-year high of 2.885% set on Monday.
4. Oil on track for weekly losses of more than 7% on output worries
The U.S. benchmark marked its sixth consecutive session of declines on Friday on was on track for weekly loss of around 7.5% as investors continued to worry that increased production would off-set the OPEC-led attempt to curb output and rebalance the market.
Iran announced plans to increase its production within the next four years by at least 700,000 barrels a day.
That added to a report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) this week that revealed that U.S. crude production rose to a record high of 10.25 million barrels per day (bpd), placing its output beyond that of Saudi Arabia, the largest OPEC producer.
Later on Friday, market participants will have further input on U.S. shale production when Baker Hughes releases its most recent weekly rig count data.
U.S. crude oil futures lost 0.98% to $60.55 at 6:01AM ET (11:01GMT), while Brent oil fell 0.65% to $64.39.
5. Chinese inflation eases causing worry over loss of economic momentum
Annual consumer and producer price inflation in China both eased as expected in January, moving against fears of increasing price pressures in the likes of the U.S. or Europe.
The data causes some concern that the world’s second-largest economy may be slowly starting to lose some momentum, although experts warned that data may be distorted due to calendar issues with the start of the Lunar New Year on February 16."

1656,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 12:33AM ET</span>",Classic Haven Assets Don't Reflect Panic in Markets Right Now,"(Bloomberg) -- So much for the adage that stocks are inversely correlated with Treasuries and the Japanese yen. Equities have slumped over the past two weeks but there’s been little reaction in the classic haven assets.
One positive way to skew this information is that other assets are confirming the consensus view that this is just a “healthy correction” in the equity market and the good times will roll on again very soon.
The negative interpretation is that there’s far too much complacency, and so broader market pain will ensue if shares don’t bounce back imminently.
Some might argue that assets are no longer moving in line -- but anyone who holds that view may want to have a look at what happened in 2008 when emerging markets supposedly decoupled from their developed counterparts. That seemed true to some until the real pain hit, and then it was quite clearly shown up to be pretty ridiculous.
Global economies and asset markets are more connected today than ever before. 
While stocks from Sydney to Hong Kong are selling off Friday, gold has barely budged and the yen is actually weaker. Treasuries, too, have moved relatively little over the past 24 hours.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar is forecast to strengthen over the coming year, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday, as expected Bank of Canada interest rate hikes and broad pressure on the U.S. dollar offset uncertainty over the future of the NAFTA trade deal.
The poll of more than 40 foreign exchange strategists predicted that the loonie will edge up to C$1.250 to the greenback, or 80 U.S. cents, in one month, from around C$1.255 on Wednesday. After a period of stabilization, it is then expected to climb to C$1.230 in a year.
""Higher interest rates in Canada and good economic data should help the loonie,"" said Hendrix Vachon, senior economist at Desjardins. ""A reduction of recent volatility in the stock market should also help.""
The loonie  has retreated more than 2 percent since stocks began to head sharply lower on Friday. Last week, the currency hit its strongest in more than four months at C$1.225.
Commodity-linked currencies tend to underperform when stocks fall, because of the signal that it sends on prospects for global economic growth. Oil is one of Canada's major exports.
The Bank of Canada raised its benchmark interest rate to 1.25 percent in January, its third hike since July, judging that the economy is operating at close to capacity.
Money markets expect two further hikes this year but economic data will likely need to stay robust to support additional policy tightening. [CA/POLL]
""The currency will be vulnerable to any disappointment on the data front in the months ahead,"" said George Davis, chief technical strategist at RBC Capital Markets. ""Add to that the risks that linger around the next two rounds of NAFTA negotiations.""
He projects the loonie will fall to C$1.27 in one month but then rebound to C$1.23 in a year.
The United States, Canada and Mexico plan to meet in Mexico City on Feb. 26 to start the seventh round of talks to renegotiate the North America Free Trade Agreement. Talks are supposed to culminate in Washington in March with the final round. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from NAFTA if he cannot rework it in favor of the United States. The outcome is important to Canada as it sends about 75 percent of its exports south of the border.
Other potential challenges for Canada's economy could include the uncertain impact of tighter mortgage rules, which took effect at the start of January on a once red-hot housing market, and past rate hikes on highly indebted consumers.
Still, the expectation the U.S. dollar (DXY) will extend its 2017 losses is a major reason why some strategists are bullish on the loonie.
They say potential tightening of monetary policy by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan and U.S. structural headwinds - such as fiscal and current account deficits - could weigh on the greenback.
""A weak U.S. dollar environment is positive for commodities priced in U.S. dollars,"" said Eric Theoret, a currency strategist at Scotiabank. ""It will be a terms of trade benefit for Canada where the price of our exports rise relative to the price of our imports.""

1668,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 02:40AM ET</span>",LatAm currencies to emerge unscathed from stock market rout,"By Bruno Federowski
BRASILIA (Reuters) - A strong outlook for global economic growth is likely to guide Latin American currencies safely through the recent turmoil in global financial markets, the latest Reuters poll showed.
Strategists and economists polled by Reuters either strengthened or maintained their forecasts for five of the six regional currencies, even as world stocks suffered their biggest selloff in six years earlier this week.
The two main currencies in the region, the Brazilian real (BRBY) and the Mexican peso , are set to trade at 3.35 and 18.6 to the dollar in a year, respectively, unchanged from the January poll.
That underscores the view that the ructions in equity markets have had very little impact on the much larger global bond and foreign exchange markets.
The currencies of Chile , Colombia  and Peru  are all expected to trade at slightly stronger levels than previously forecast, according to the Feb. 1-6 Reuters poll. 
This suggests that sharp losses seen last week are unlikely to hold as economic growth strengthen both at home and abroad.
""At the end of the day, faster growth is the main story, much more than the debate over whether U.S. rates will rise two, three or four times this year,"" said Banco J. Safra chief economist Carlos Kawall.
Data last week showing a solid annual rate of increase in U.S. wages, driven by higher paid workers, kindled a jump in U.S. Treasuries yields that helped trigger a global stock market rout.
Higher U.S. rates could drain funds away from emerging markets, which tend to offer higher yields. Still, moves in Latin American currencies have been somewhat limited.
In a report,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimated that the Brazilian real, the Mexican peso, the South African rand  and the Turkish lira  have historically weakened around 2 percent for each 4 percent decline in the S&P 500 (SPX).
But Brazilian and Mexican currencies lost only slightly more than 2.3 percent while the S&P 500 dropped 6.1 percent between Friday and Monday, a disparity that Morgan Stanley attributed to a ""stronger fundamental position of EM macro.""
An improved outlook for Latin American economies, as highlighted by a recent Reuters poll, should cushion their currencies from major volatility ahead of major elections in the region. [ECILT/LTAM]
Voters will decide in Brazil in October on President Michel Temer's successor. Temer, whose approval rates have tumbled due to corruption accusations, has pledged not to run, casting a shadow on the continuity of his austerity efforts.
Temer's administration has struggled to gather support for a bill cutting social security spending, which investors see as key to curbing growth of public debt and boosting long-term growth. But it could increase the burden on his successor.
Should the new president unwind Temer's measures to cut red tape and privatize state companies, Brazil's real would trade closer to 3.50 to the dollar, said Jason Vieira, chief economist at Infinity Asset.
Still, Vieira does not expect that to be the case, particularly after an appeals court upheld former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's conviction for corruption.
Lula, who has sharply criticized Temer's policies, has been leading voting intention polls but could be barred from running.
Meanwhile, nationalist candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador continues leading polls in Mexico, stoking concerns of increased tensions with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration as trade talks drag on. 
A recent Reuters poll showed the peso would take a bigger hit if Trump killed the North American Free Trade Agreement than from an election victory for Obrador. A combination of both would drive the peso to near record lows, the survey showed.

(Reuters) - Investors trimmed their long positions in most emerging Asian currencies in the last two weeks, a Reuters poll showed, as rising Treasury yields helped the dollar rebound from a three-year low touched in late January.
There has been a steady climb in U.S. yields over the past two weeks on expectations the European Central Bank will tighten monetary policy, and on increasing worries that inflation is accelerating due to bigger paychecks.
The benchmark 10-year yields (US10YT=RR) rose to a four-year high of 2.88 percent, with traders adding to their positions for a faster pace of rate hikes, lending support to the dollar.
Among Asian currencies, bullish bets on the Chinese yuan  dipped for the first time since December, while that on the Malaysian ringgit  touched their lowest since November.
Long positions on the Singapore dollar  and the Taiwan dollar  reached a near two-month low, according to the poll of 12 analysts, traders and fund managers.
Investors, however, turned more bearish on the Philippine peso , with short positions at their highest since November.
The peso has been the weakest in Asia against the dollar so far this year, shedding 2.8 percent, with vulnerability to capital outflows seen increasing due to deficit concerns.
The Philippine central bank projects there was a current account deficit of $100 million last year, the first since 2002, and it forecasts a deficit of $700 million this year.
Bullish bets on the Korean won  were trimmed to five-month lows, while positions on Indonesian rupiah  went from long to nearly neutral.
The won has lost about 1.6 percent so far this year, making it the second weakest currency in the region after the peso.
Bullish sentiment towards the Thai baht  weakened slightly, while the Indian rupee , which has slid about 0.5 percent so far this year, saw bullish bets at their lowest since January 2017.
""The more neutral positioning on the rupee reflects the Indian markets' heightened unease about the government's fiscal path, triggered by its budget last week, which has led to higher inflation expectations,"" said Reuters FX analyst Krishna Kumar.
The poll was conducted between Tuesday and Wednesday, with the bulk of the responses coming in by Wednesday. 
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long on U.S. dollars.

The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

1671,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 01:00AM ET</span>",China's Yuan Plunges Most Since Aftermath of Devaluation in 2015,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s yuan extended declines, sinking the most since the aftermath of the shock devaluation of the currency in August 2015, after trade figures missed estimates and amid speculation policy makers will step up efforts to rein in gains.
The onshore spot rate weakened 0.7 percent to 6.3269 against the dollar as of 1:22 p.m. in Shanghai, after dropping as much as 1 percent earlier. The currency extended losses after China reported a much narrower trade surplus than expected, on the back of a jump in imports. Volatility surged, and the gap between onshore and offshore rates tripled compared with the same time on Wednesday.
The yuan’s climb to a two-year high this week had fueled speculation officials may seek to curb one-way bets, and that they will grow more tolerant of capital outflows:
“Excessive confidence led to an excessive rally in the yuan, and then there came excessive concerns on intervention, which resulted in excessive nervousness,” said Zhou Hao, an economist at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) in Singapore. “The pressures reached a peak today as the trade data surprised and stocks slumped. So the result was a stampede with stop-loss being triggered and yuan bulls rushing to the exit. The currency will remain pressured in the coming weeks.”
Chinese shares extended declines along with the yuan, with the Shanghai Composite Index set for its largest three-day drop in almost two years.
Data on Thursday showed the nation’s trade surplus stood at $20.3 billion in January, less than half of the forecast figure, as imports jumped more than expected.
Before Thursday’s pullback, the yuan had outperformed other currencies against the greenback on optimism over the Chinese economy and the conversion of foreign-currency funds accumulated during during the three years of depreciation through 2016.
Here’s what other strategists made of the sudden slump:
Tommy Xie, an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore:
“Today’s trade surplus worked as the key catalyst for the long yuan positions to square. With SAFE’s Pan saying all capital control measures rolling back to neutral and Economic Information Daily’s warning on one-way movement of the yuan, traders are scaling back their bets.""
Ken Cheung, an Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd.:
“The slide of the yuan today is triggered by the unexpected decline in China’s trade surplus. As previously market view was very one-sided to favor yuan, the negative data should have led to adjustment of extreme long-yuan positions.""“Besides, the reported resume of QDLP program also signal China has started to relax control on outflows, in a bid to cut appreciation bias.""
Sim Moh Siong, currency strategist at Bank of Singapore Ltd.:
“My take is it’s a combination of factors including stronger dollar, the nervousness in the equity market and the heavy positioning accumulated earlier that’s caused the decline. The way USD/CNY has moved recently indicated there’s quite heavy long yuan positions recently and in light of equity market and dollar rebound, that’s probably led to some position liquidation.""“The trade surplus and the news about resuming the QDLP could be a factor, but I’m not sure they’re the main driver. Actually I don’t think the trade data is that surprising, as it’s very difficult to forecast after all, so I’m hesitant to read too much into it.""

Senate leaders reached a $300 billion two-year budget deal, easing investor uncertainty, averting a government shutdown just a day before a stopgap funding measure was slated to expire.
The rise in bond yields came amid confirmation of the government budget deal and a somewhat subdued 10-year auction as demand was light with the bid-to-cover ratio at 2.34 versus a previous 2.69, representing the lowest demand since September.
Offsetting that, somewhat, was mostly update corporate earnings as Snap delivered a blowout earnings report to close more than 40% higher, while Walt Disney beat earnings but missed revenue expectations.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar was off recent lows against major rivals on Thursday, benefiting from the euro's weakness and higher U.S. yields but capped by concerns about recent equity market volatility.
Against a basket of six major rival currencies, the dollar was steady on the day at 90.267 (DXY), probing its highest levels in two weeks. 
The euro was slightly higher on the day at $1.2268 (EUR=), not far from its overnight low of $1.2246 and a far cry from last month's 3-year high of $1.2538. 
""The dollar is stronger, across the board, as the euro had recently been too strong, with too many expectations about early policy normalization of the European Central Bank, and investors are now unwinding those positions,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
""The dollar/yen seems to be capped by uncertainty in the equity markets, which will likely keep it in a range,"" Yamamoto added. ""But maybe the equity market downturn won't last for long, because the world economy is solid.""
The dollar was steady on the day against its Japanese counterpart at 109.32 yen . 
Higher U.S. yields also underpinned the greenback. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes  stood at 2.811 percent in Asian trade, compared with its U.S. close of 2.843 percent on Wednesday.
The benchmark yield rose as high as 2.885 percent on Monday, its highest since January 2014, after stronger inflation data led investors to fear that the Federal Reserve may raise rates more often than previously expected.
San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams sought to assuage some of those fears on Wednesday.
He said at an event in Honolulu that the U.S. central bank will stick to its plan for ""steady, gradual"" interest rate increases even though recent U.S. economic data has been stronger than some have expected and the labor market has tightened.
Also weighing on U.S. debt, U.S. congressional leaders on Wednesday reached a two-year budget deal to raise government spending by almost $300 billion. 
The New Zealand dollar, meanwhile, skidded to four-week lows after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand kept interest rates steady at a record low on Thursday.
It said volatility in equity markets this week was a warning that global markets were nervous about the risk of higher inflation and rising interest rates.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar slipped against the yen on Wednesday, handing back earlier gains, as the recovery in share markets lost steam and dampened investor risk appetite.
The greenback was 0.4 percent lower at 109.155.
The currency reached a high of 109.720 yen earlier in the day as regional equities such as Japan's Nikkei soared, taking their cue from a late rebound on Wall Street.
But the dollar drifted lower as the Nikkei, which rose as much as 3.4 percent, gave back most of its gains on anxiety over more weakness in U.S. share markets. U.S. stock futures fell during Asian trade, stoking such fears. (T)
The focus remains on U.S. stocks, which were the source of the latest turbulence in global markets and currencies.
The recent surge in long-term U.S. bond yields to four-year highs had helped trigger the slide in the equity market, and while yields have pulled back from those peaks, they still remain elevated.
""The 10-year Treasury yield has nudged back ahead of today's auction. Depending on how the auction goes, U.S. equities could face renewed pressure,"" said Makoto Noji, senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""Global stocks are expected to remain on a nervous footing going forward,"" Noji said.
Following soft demand for a $26 billion three-year sale on Tuesday, the U.S. Treasury will auction $24 billion of 10-year government bonds later on Wednesday.
The greenback performed slightly better against currencies as investors have sought shelter in the greenback amid the recent rout in global equities, which was triggered by a massive decline in Wall Street shares.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was a shade lower at 89.530, after reaching a two-week peak of 90.034 overnight.
The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.2391 after slipping to a two-week low of $1.2314 the previous day.
Wall Street shares bounced about 2 percent on Tuesday after suffering the biggest one-day sell-off in more than six years. S&P mini futures, however, were down 1 percent and pointed to a lower open for U.S. shares later in the day.
The Australian dollar, which tends to suffer during risk aversion, was 0.5 percent lower at $0.7868.
The pound was flat at $1.3951 after touching a low of $1.3838 overnight, its weakest since Jan. 19.

1693,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 10:41PM ET</span>",Dollar holds firm as investors scurry to safety amid equities sell-off,"By Shinichi Saoshiro
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar stood tall on Tuesday as a rout in global equities prompted anxious investors to cut exposure to riskier assets and seek shelter in the relative safety of the greenback.
The U.S. currency held firm against most of its counterparts with the exception of the yen, which is the perennial safe-haven bet during times of risk aversion.
Against the yen, the greenback fell 0.3 percent to 108.73 yen, coming under pressure as the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield slid about 11 basis points to 2.685 percent in Asian trade.
Investor risk aversion triggered a drop in U.S. bond yields, leading to the fall in the dollar against the yen, said Sim Moh Siong, FX strategist for Bank of Singapore.
""I would see 107 to 108 as the next support for dollar/yen,"" Sim said, adding that if the selloff picks up further steam the dollar could fall towards 104 yen.
The euro was steady at $1.2370 after shedding 0.7 percent overnight to pull further away from a three-year high of $1.2538 set late in January.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 89.610. Since Friday, when the selloff in equities began in earnest, the index has gained about 1.1 percent. 
Emerging Asian currencies retreated, with the Malaysian ringgit and Indonesian rupiah both slipping around 0.4 percent against the dollar. 
The U.S. currency was on the back foot as recently as late January, when the dollar index fell to a three-year trough of 88.438, hurt by a range of factors including concerns about U.S. trade protectionism and perceptions of narrowing yield advantage.
It caught a break, however, lifted by Friday's robust U.S. employment report and the punishing sell-off in the recently bullish global equity markets.
""We are seeing a big rewinding of positions that had been built up since the start of the year, such as euro longs,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
""The stock market plunge caused by the jump in yields has been the trigger. Investors hurting from the drop in equities are seen trying to limit their losses by selling recently bullish currencies like the euro, which in turn supports the dollar.""
The dollar also tends to benefit from its perceived safe-haven status at times of market ructions. 
The shakeout persisted in Tuesday's Asian trade, with U.S. S&P futures tumbling 2.5 percent to 4-month lows at one point, while markets in Asia took another battering.
That came after the Dow, which rose to a record high late in January, fell 2.5 percent on Friday and plunged 4.6 percent on Monday.
The sharp pullback comes amid concerns about higher inflation, sending U.S. 10-year bond yields surging to a four-year top on Monday.
Friday's U.S. jobs report was the latest jolt to financial markets, as strong wages growth reinforced the inflation and monetary tightening speculation, with traders betting the Federal Reserve might raise rates at a faster pace than expected this year.
The pound touched a two-week low of $1.3937 on Tuesday after dropping more than 1 percent overnight. Sterling, which hit a 1-1/2-year high of $1.4346 late last month, was fetching $1.3957.

The Australian dollar touched a three-week low of $0.7855 and was last down 0.1 percent at $0.7870. The Aussie had advanced to over a 2-1/2-year top at $0.8136 on Jan. 26.

The central bank said the first auction of its new DICOM system yielded an exchange rate of 30,987.5 bolivars per euro, equivalent to around 25,000 per dollar.
That is a devaluation of 86.6 percent with respect to the previous DICOM rate and 99.6 percent from the subsidized rate of 10 bolivars per dollar, which was eliminated last week. (https://goo.gl/TRuF2Z)
Venezuela is undergoing a major crisis, with quadruple-digit inflation and shortages of food and medicine. Economists consistently describe the 15-year-old currency control system as the principal obstacle to functioning commerce and industry.
The new rate is still dwarfed by the black market rate for greenbacks, currently at 228,000 bolivars per dollar according to website DolarToday, which is used as a reference.
The existence of such disparate exchange rates has for years encouraged Venezuelans to buy dollars on the cheap and flip them on the black market for a profit. That has created shortages of hard currency, which in turn fuels shortages of imported products such as food and medicine.
The government has repeatedly created foreign exchange mechanisms similar to DICOM, but business leaders say they never provided a steady supply of hard currency. 
The government would repeatedly end up shuttering the foreign exchange platforms in part because maintaining an exchange rate so divergent from the black market rate proved to be unsustainable.

""If the exchange rate is imposed arbitrarily, it will perpetuate the crisis,"" wrote Alejandro Grisanti of local consultancy Ecoanalitica on Twitter.

1697,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 01:24PM ET</span>",Dollar rebounds as U.S. yield spike stalls,"By Richard Leong
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose against a basket of currencies on Monday as the U.S. bond market selloff leveled off after the 10-year yield hit a four-year peak on worries that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates faster to counter signs of wage pressure.
Analysts cautioned, however, that further gains in the greenback would be limited as other economies seem poised to expand quicker than the United States. Speculation that other central banks besides the Federal Reserve may roll back stimulus will probably cap the U.S. currency's recovery.
""The dollar selling (had been) overdone,"" said Paul Christopher, head global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis. ""We think rates are not going to go up a lot more here.""
Early on Monday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) reached 2.885 percent, its highest since January 2014, after a robust jobs report showed wage growth last month posted its biggest annual gain since June 2009. The yield was last at 2.843 percent, down 1 basis point from late on Friday.
The Institute for Supply Management's gauge on U.S. services industries, which hit a 12-1/2 year high last month, also supported the dollar on Monday.
At 12:52 p.m. (1752 GMT), the dollar (DXY) was up 0.3 percent against a basket of six major currencies at 89.469 after gaining 0.6 percent on Friday.
""Could (Monday's performance) change the trend?"" Christopher said. ""I doubt it."" 
Data on currency futures positions showed net bearish bets against the dollar swelled to $17.5 billion  last week, just shy of a five-year high. 
The euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.2410 (EUR=), slightly below a three-year high of $1.2538 on the EBS trading system (EUR=EBS). 
The euro briefly pared losses following upbeat comments by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi before the European Parliament. But Draghi said the current surge of the single currency might impair its outlook for price stability.
Against the yen, the dollar weakened in step with losses on Wall Street, where rising bond yields have sparked selling in stocks on concerns about rising borrowing costs on corporate profits and consumer spending. 

The greenback slipped 0.05 percent to 110.03 yen , holding above a four-month low set on Jan. 26.

1699,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 10:30AM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar Extends Gains as Wall Street Slumps,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar moved higher on Monday as the currency built on gains from Friday as a stronger than expected U.S. jobs report bolstered expectations for a faster pace of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve this year.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.30% to 89.31 by 10:28 AM ET (15:28 AM GMT).
Demand for the dollar was underpinned after data on Friday showing that U.S. hiring remained robust and average earnings rose by the most since 2009 in January.
The strong wage growth, seen as a potential precursor to a pickup in inflation underlined the case for the Fed to raise interest rates at a faster pace this year.
Fears of a return of inflation continued to fuel a selloff in equities, with U.S. stocks opening sharply lower on Monday. The decline in equities also drove safe haven demand for the greenback.
Expectations of tightening monetary policy tend to boost the dollar, as rising rates make the currency more attractive to yield-seeking investors, but higher borrowing costs are a negative for stocks.
The Fed left rates unchanged last week but said it anticipated inflation would likely rise in 2018, underlining expectations that borrowing costs will continue to increase. The Fed currently projects three rate hikes for this year.
The jobs report spurred a recovery in the dollar after its fell to three year lows in late January, pressured lower by a range of factors, including concerns about U.S. trade protectionism and perceptions of narrowing yield advantage.
The euro was lower against the dollar, with EUR/USD down 0.34% to 1.2416.
The dollar was steady against the yen, with USD/JPY last at 110.22. The yen tends to rise in times of market turbulence thanks to its safe haven status.
Sterling was weaker against the dollar, with GBP/USD shedding 0.66% to trade at 1.4021.
The pound had already come under pressure earlier Monday after data showing that growth in Britain’s service sector slowed sharply last month, as Brexit fears hit companies.
The dollar received an additional boost after data on Monday showing that U.S. service sector activity accelerated at the fastest pace in more than 12 years in January.
The ISM non-manufacturing index rose from 56 in December to 59.9 last month, which was the highest level since August 2005."
