BTC/USD fell 6.1% during U.S. morning hours to trade at USD890.00 on the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange. The currency fell by as much as 12% earlier to hit a session low of USD880.11.
Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba banned bitcoin from its shopping websites last week effective January 14, a crippling blow that could make it much harder to use the virtual currency in China.
Last month, the People’s Bank of China clamped down on Bitcoin, saying the digital currency doesn't have ""real meaning"" and lacks legal protections.
China’s central bank subsequently banned third-party payment processors from handling payments for Bitcoin exchanges, effectively ending legal purchases of Bitcoin in the country.
Prices of the virtual currency soared to an all-time high of USD1,241.10 on November 29. It was trading at USD100 in early October.
Demand for the virtual currency remained supported amid speculation an increasing number of online retailers in the U.S. will begin accepting Bitcoin payments in the year ahead.
In the past month, the number of businesses on CoinMap, a website showing physical companies and vendors accepting Bitcoin, has tripled to more than 2,300.
Bitcoin is digital cash for the internet and it is not backed by a government or central bank to regulate or issue it. It can be used to purchase goods and services from stores and online retailers."

Meanwhile, net long euro positions were cut in half, falling from 30,600 contracts to 14,500. The net short yen position of 129,000 contracts is the smallest since late November.

114,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 08, 2014 10:00AM ET</span>",Another Slam For Bitcoin In China,"By Sophie Song. Not that you’d want to spend your bitcoins, when the virtual currency is trading at more than $1,000, but China is practically making sure you cannot – ecommerce giant Alibaba has banned bitcoin from its shopping websites. This ban comes on the heels of two bans from the Chinese government, first preventing financial institutions from handling the virtual currency, and later preventing deposits made in yuan. Alibaba’s Taobao, an eBay-like platform connecting individual buyers to small-time merchants, has never accepted bitcoin payments itself, but previously allowed merchants to accept Bitcoin as payment. Some were even selling bitcoins and computer chips needed to mine for the virtual currency, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. But those transactions will no longer be allowed after Jan. 14. Alibaba has also banned all other virtual currencies along with bitcoin, as well as all related products including mining software. Alibaba means to “promote the healthy development of Taobao Marketplace and to more effectively protect the interests of Taobao members,” a statement from the company, which also owns Tmall.com and Alibaba.com, said. The statement added that the decision stems from the Chinese central bank’s ruling in early December that prohibited financial institutions from handling bitcoins, the Financial Times reported. At the beginning of 2013, bitcoins were trading for just $13. But virtually overnight, bitcoin’s fortune began to soar in China after a documentary airing on China’s state television brought the currency wider recognition, before falling hard on the series of regulations and bans in the nation. Even so, BTC China remains the world’s largest bitcoin trading platform by trading volumes, and along with Huobi, another platform, accounts for more than 60 percent of global transactions in bitcoins over the past seven days, according to Bitcoinity, a website that tracks Bitcoin usage. The virtual currency’s China woes in December caused its value to plummet, from above $1,000 to around $380 on the Chinese exchanges, but this week climbed to $1,119 yet again, after popular online game developer Zynga Inc. (Nasdaq:ZNGA) began accepting bitcoins for in-game payments in a limited scope."

In December prosecutors launched a wide ranging investigation into corruption, focusing on figures close to the ruling APK party.The selloff on the lira has also been fuelled following the Federal Reserve’s December decision to roll back its asset purchase program to USD75 billion a month from USD85 billion a month starting this month.Elsewhere, the euro was close to record highs against the lira, with EUR/TRY advancing 0.86% to 2.9838, not far from the highs of 3.0156 struck last Thursday."

808,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 13, 2013 02:50AM ET</span>",Forex - NZD/USD steady after RBNZ comments ,"Investing.com - The New Zealand dollar was steady against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday, supported by comments by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, although speculation the Federal Reserve could soon begin tapering stimulus measures continued to support the greenback.  NZD/USD hit 0.8239 during late Asian trade, the session high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.8224, inching up 0.03%.  The pair was likely to find support at 0.8134, the low of September 15 and resistance at 0.8310, the high of October 31.  RBNZ Governor Graeme Wheeler earlier said interest rates will start being raised next year, due to the rise in inflation, which is likely to drive the kiwi higher.  ""The concern will be that the interest differential between New Zealand and any of the advanced economies will widen,"" Wheeler added.  The comments came after, in its biannual financial stability report, the central bank highlighted the overvalued housing market as the main threat to the country's financial system.  Meanwhile, the greenback remained supported after last week’s stronger than forecast U.S. nonfarm payrolls report prompted investors to bring forward expectations for a reduction in the Fed’s USD85 billion-a-month asset purchase program.  The kiwi was little changed against the euro with EUR/NZD dipping 0.02%, to hit 1.6338.  Later in the day, New Zealand was to publish data on retail sales."

In Asian trading Friday, AUD/USD rose 0.08% to 0.9463. The pair was likely to find support at 0.9422, the low of November 1 and resistance at 0.9542, the high of November 6. On Friday, China’s Customs Administration said exports there jumped 5.6% last month, easily topping expectations calling for growth of 3.2%. Imports rose 7.6%, below the estimate of 8.5%, leaving China with a trade surplus of USD31.1 billion. Chinese policymakers are set to meet this weekend to discuss reform initiatives, but the Aussie will remain in play in the coming days because China delivers inflation and retail sales data. October inflation is expected to have climbed to an 18-month high. China, the world’s second-largest economy, is Australia's largest export market. AUD/USD will be in play again Friday at U.S. is set to deliver the University of Michigan is to release the preliminary reading of its consumer sentiment index, while the Labor Department will release its report on nonfarm payrolls and the unemployment rate. Global data points could be pivotal to the Aussie’s near-term upside because it is considered one of the riskier currencies and an accurate gauge of risk appetite. Australia itself is struggling to foster growth outside of the mining sector, indicating that while the China data is helpful, Australia’s domestic, non-export economy could use additional support. Elsewhere, AUD/JPY rose 0.16% to 92.91 while AUD/NZD fell 0.08% to 1.1356."

In Asian trading Tuesday, EUR/USD inched up 0.03% to 1.3791. GBP/USD slid 0.25% to 1.6102 after a report compiled by the Confederation of British Industry said just 2% of retailers reported an increase in sales in October, down from 34% in September. USD/JPY fell 0.06% to 97.64 after Japan’s Statistic Bureau said the country’s unemployment rate fell to 4% last month from 4.1% in August. Economists expected a reading of 4% for September. In a separate report, the Statistics Bureau said household spending in the world’s third-largest economy rose 3.7% in September after falling 1.6% in August. Analysts expected a September increase of just 0.5%. In another report, the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry said that Japanese retail sales rose 3.1% in September after rising 1.1% in August. Analysts expected an increase of 1.9% last month. Some market observers believe the retail sales and household spending numbers shot up last month ahead of the implementation of controversial consumption tax in Japan. USD/CHF rose 0.03% to 0.8960 while USD/CAD inched down 0.02% to 1.0444. In U.S. economic news out Monday, industry data revealed that U.S. pending home sales fell 5.6% last month, down for the fourth consecutive month and well below market calls for a gain of 0.1% Industrial production rose 0.6% last month, better than the 0.4% increase economists expected. Capacity utilization rose to 78.3% from an upward-revised 77.9%, beating the estimate of 78%. AUD/USD slipped 0.36% to 0.9540 after Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens said the Aussie could be ""materially lower"" in the future. NZD/USD fell 0.20% to 0.8286 while the U.S. Dollar Index inched 0.01% to 79.41."

In Asian trading Tuesday, AUD/USD inched down 0.05% to 0.9652. The pair was likely to find support at 0.9605, the low of October 18 and resistance at 0.9760, the high of June 4. The greenback traded higher against most of its major rivals Tuesday in what could be a sign traders are preparing for disappointment out of the delayed jobs report. The September jobs report for the U.S., originally due out October 4 but delayed because of the shutdown, is due out later Tuesday. Economists expect the addition of 180,000 new jobs and for the unemployment rate to stay at 7.3%. In U.S. economic news out Monday, the National Association of Realtors reported earlier that total existing home sales declined 1.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.29 million units in September from a downwardly revised 5.39 million in August, mainly due to home prices outpacing income growth. Analysts were expecting to see 5.30 million units sold. Meanwhile, some market observers expect the Aussie’s recent bullishness to continue due to strong Chinese economic growth. China, the world’s second-largest economy, is Australia’s largest export market. Deutsche Bank has a 98 U.S.- cent forecast for the currency by year-end and would not rule out a 1 U.S. dollar valuation at some point in the fourth quarter, according to Xinhua News. Elsewhere, AUD/JPY inched up 0.01% to 94.82 while AUD/NZD was flat at 1.1421."

The possibility of another debt crisis also loomed, as the temporary debt ceiling agreement reached early Thursday does not resolve the underlying budgetary issues dividing Republicans and Democrats.  The deal will fund the government until January 15 and raise the government borrowing limit until February 7. Both sides also agreed to talks over broad budget issues in an attempt to reach a longer-term deal by December 13.  Earlier Friday, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said that effects of the central bank's monetary stimulus are firmly emerging on economic activity and that the positive impact is spreading in the economy and prices. The euro was steady against the dollar, with EUR/USD inching up 0.04% to 1.3682.The dollar was lower against the pound, with GBP/USD up 0.14% to 1.6185, and steady against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF easing up 0.02% to hit 0.9026.Elsewhere, the greenback was broadly lower against its Australian, New Zealand and Canadian counterparts, with AUD/USD gaining 0.37% to 0.9669, NZD/USD edging 0.12% higher to trade at 0.8496 and USD/CAD down 0.10% to 1.0284.  Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens said in a speech earlier that good progress has been made, but there remains a lot of work to do be made to make sure that post-global financial crisis reforms are implemented.  Separately, the export-related currencies found support after official data showed China gross domestic product grew by 7.8% in the third quarter, in line with expectations and up from 7.5% in the three months to June.  The data eased concerns over the strength of the recovery in the world's second-largest economy.  A separate report showed that industrial production in China rose by an annualized rate of 10.2% in September, exceeding expectations for a 10.1% increase, after a 10.4% rise the previous month.  In Canada, official data showed that core consumer price inflation remained unchanged at 1.3% in September, confounding expectations for a downtick to 1%.  Consumer price inflation, including the eight most volatile items, rose to 0.2% last month, from a flat reading in August, compared to expectations for a rise to 0.1%. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.06% to 79.68."

1337,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 08, 2013 11:00PM ET</span>",Forex - USD/JPY soars on Yellen nomination news,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded higher against the Japanese yen during Wednesday’s Asian session following media reports that President Barrack Obama will nominate Federal Reserve Vice Chairwoman Janet Yellen to lead the U.S. central bank when Chairman Ben Bernanke retires early next year. In Asian trading Wednesday, USD/JPY climbed 0.41% to 97.27. The pair was likely to find support at 96.57, Monday's low, and resistance at 98.72, last Tuesday's high. Although Yellen was widely expected to be President Obama’s choice to succeed Bernanke after Larry Summers withdrew from consideration several weeks ago, the yen still came under pressure on the news because is believed to be far more dovish than Summers. If the U.S. Senate confirms Yellen, she will become the first woman to lead the U.S. central bank. Minutes of the Federal Reserve's September meeting will be released later Wednesday and that should provide important clues regarding how the Fed is feeling about tapering of its USD85 billion-per-month in bond purchases. Markets are already in a precarious position due to the government shutdown in the U.S. Fears are rising that congressional leaders will not be able to reach a comprise before the October 17 to extend the U.S. debt ceiling. Failure to raise the debt ceiling could send the world’s largest economy hurdling toward default. In recent days, the yen has shown some signs of strength against the greenback because the Japanese currency is a prime safe-haven alternative to the greenback in times of elevated market stress. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its forecasts for the global economy, saying it now expects growth of 2.9% this year, down from 3.1% in July. It expects growth of 3.6% in 2014, down from 3.8%. Elsewhere, EUR/JPY gained 0.34% to 131.94 while AUD/JPY rose 0.47% to 91.73."

In Asian trading Tuesday, EUR/USD fell 0.08% to 1.3571 after data released Monday revealed that the economy grew by 0.3% in the second quarter, unchanged from a preliminary estimate and in line with forecasts.A separate report showed that the Sentix index of euro zone investor confidence dropped to 6.1 in October from 6.5 in September as concerns over the political impasse in the U.S. hurt sentiment. Analysts had expected the index to rise to 10.6 this month. USD/JPY rose 0.12% to 96.83 after Ministry of Finance data showed Japan’s current account surplus plunged 63.7% on a year-over-year basis. The surplus was JPY161.5 billion, well below estimates calling for a surplus of JPY540.9 billion. Economists expected Japan’s current account surplus to rise 23.4%. The surplus was the lowest for any August since at least 1985, Bloomberg reported. GBP/USD fell 0.07% to 1.6085 after the U.K. RICS home price index rose 54% in September from 41% in August. The August reading was revised higher from 40%. Analysts expected a September reading of 45%. USD/CHF added 0.13% to 0.9040 while USD/CAD gained 0.12% to 1.0325 on news the U.S. could surpass Russia for the title of world’s largest oil and natural gas producer. On Monday, Statistics Canada said the total value of building permits issued in Canada was down 21.1% in August, following an upwardly revised increase of 21.4% in July. Analysts had expected building permits to decline by 7%. The ongoing U.S. government shutdown pressured riskier currencies as AUD/USD lost 0.08% to 0.9422. NZD/USD dipped 0.30% to 0.8280. The U.S. Dollar Index inched up 0.05% to 80.05."

Investors were eyeing the final reading of U.S. second quarter gross domestic product due later in the day, after a recent string of economic reports underlined concerns over the outlook for the U.S. economic recovery.

Analysts had expected the current account deficit to narrow to GBP12 billion in the second quarter.Elsewhere, the greenback was broadly lower against its Australian, New Zealand and Canadian counterparts, with AUD/USD gaining 0.33% to 0.9398, NZD/USD climbing 0.61% to 0.8291 and USD/CAD dipping 0.05% to 1.0309.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.13% to 80.52.

In Asian trading Thursday, USD/JPY climbed 0.29% to 98.22. The pair was likely to find support at 97.89 and resistance at 99.97, the high of September 13. Earlier Wednesday, the Ministry of Finance said Japan’s trade balance rose to negative JPY790 billion in August from negative JPY910 billion in July. The July figure was revised up from negative JPY940 billion. Analysts expected an August reading of negative JPY810 billion. The Fed said it will not tapering its asset-buying program, implying it is still concerned about the sturdiness of the U.S. economy. Easing programs usually adversely impact currencies, the trade-off for bolstering economic growth. The U.S. central bank ""decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases,"" it said in a statement. Most market participants were expecting the Fed to taper, so the surprise announcement sent U.S. stocks to record highs and that ebullience has carried over to the Asian session, but there is speculation that the carry-trade could return and that could affect the yen. Still, there is doubt the yen will be the funding source of choice for developed market carry-trade pairs. Some traders say yen-funded carry trades could flourish only against higher-yielding emerging currencies such as the South African rand, the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real, Reuters reported. Elsewhere, AUD/JPY rose 0.12% to 93.41 while EUR/JPY added 0.33% to 132.88."

1632,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 18, 2013 09:46PM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar mostly higher even as Fed resists tapering ,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded higher against most its major rivals during Thursday’s Asian session even after the Federal Reserve said it will make no alterations to its USD85 billion-per-month asset-buying program known as quantitative easing. In Asian trading Thursday, EUR/USD inched down 0.01% to 1.3522. Many investors felt the Fed would announce plans to trim the amount of bonds it buys each month to spur recovery, a stimulus tool known as quantitative easing that drives down long-term interest rates and weakens the dollar to spur recovery, a recipe for rising gold prices. However, the Fed surprised markets by saying tapering of its easing efforts is tied to economic data and not the calendar. The U.S. central bank ""decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases,"" it said in a statement. GBP/USD fell 0.07% to 1.6133 even after the release of the minutes of the Bank of England's September meeting, which showed that policymakers voted unanimously in favor of keeping the benchmark interest rate on hold at 0.5% and the size of the bank’s asset purchase facility unchanged at GBP375 billion.USD/JPY climbed 0.25% to 98.19 after the Ministry of Finance said Japan’s trade balance rose to negative JPY790 billion in August from negative JPY910 billion in July. The July figured was revised up from negative JPY940 billion. Analysts expected an August reading of negative JPY810 billion. USD/CHF rose 0.10% to 0.9130 while USD/CAD was flat at 1.0221. In U.S. economic news out Wednesday, the Commerce Department said single-family housing starts jumped 7% last month to an annual rate of 628,000 units, the highest level in six months. New construction for apartments and condominiums fell 11.1%. Permits for single-family homes rose 3% to the highest level since May 2008. AUD/USD fell 0.17% to 0.9505. NZD/USD jumped 0.30% to 0.8396 after Statistics New Zealand said the country’s second-quarter GDP rose 2.5%, beating the consensus estimate of 2.3%. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.09% to 80.30."
