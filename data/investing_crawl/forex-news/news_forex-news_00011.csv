In U.S. trading on Wednesday, EUR/USD was down 0.71% at 1.2645.
Six years of ultra-loose monetary policy are coming to a close.
The Federal Reserve said earlier it was leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.00-0.25% and said it was closing its monthly bond-buying program in a move widely expected by markets.
Prior to Wednesday, the Fed had been purchasing $15 billion in Treasury and mortgage debt a month to spur recovery by suppressing interest rates, though improvements taking place in the labor market prompted the U.S. central bank to end the stimulus program.
The program began in 2012 at $85 billion a month, while a gradual tapering brought it down to October's closure.
""The Committee judges that there has been a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market since the inception of its current asset purchase program. Moreover, the Committee continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing progress toward maximum employment in a context of price stability,"" the Fed said in its statement on monetary policy.
""Accordingly, the Committee decided to conclude its asset purchase program this month.""
Despite hit-or-miss economic indicators, the U.S. economy continues to recover.
While inflationary pressures remain at bay, consumer prices should soon approach the Fed's 2% comfort zone.
Still, the Fed won't rush to hike interest rates until monetary authorities are convinced the economy is firmly standing on its own two feet, though the Fed will act if it sees inflationary pressures mounting.
""The Committee anticipates, based on its current assessment, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program this month, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored,"" the statement read.

Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated.""
In the past, the Fed has hinted that rates may begin to rise when the unemployment rate reached 6.5%.
Today, an improving labor market has brought that rate down to 5.9%, though slackness still persists in the labor market in the form of many working part-time jobs and others remaining out of the workforce for too long.
Other fears persist that cooling European and Chinese economies may drag on U.S. recovery, and the Fed stressed in its statement that it will analyze a broad spectrum of data and not just a few indicators when deciding to raise interest rates, often referred to as removing policy accommodation.
""When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent,"" the Fed said.
""The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.""
Still, the dollar firmed on the overall upbeat take on the U.S. economy, as expectations for the Fed to take some time between closing its stimulus program and raising interest rates have already been priced into trading.
The dollar was up against the yen, with USD/JPY up 0.70% at 108.91, and up against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF up 0.80% at 0.9548.

USD/RUB was up 0.78% to 42.77 from 42.44 late Tuesday. The rouble has fallen by around 16% against the dollar in the last three months.



Tensions between Ukraine and Russia remained high after Moscow said Monday that it intends to recognize the results of elections due to held by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine this weekend.

Ukraine’s newly elected pro-western government says the polls violated the fragile peace deal between the two countries. A ceasefire has been in effect since September 5, but the situation remains volatile.

Sanctions imposed on Russia by the U.S. and the European Union for what they say is its role in backing the separatists have weakened the rouble, caused a spike in inflation and have almost completely shut Russian companies out of the global financial markets.

At the same time, the country’s economy has been hit by falling oil prices. Russia is the world’s second-largest oil exporter and half of its budget revenue is financed by taxes on energy exports.

On Friday, Russian government ministers warned the economy and budget may suffer if low oil prices and Western sanctions continue for some time.

Russia's central bank has spent around $55 billion of its international reserves so far this year in a bid to prop up the rouble, leaving its total reserves at approximately $452 billion.
The bank is to hold its next policy meeting on October 31.


Ratings agency Standard & Poor’s kept its sovereign rating on Russia unchanged at BBB, on Friday but said it expects” usable foreign currency reserves to decline to about four months of imports by 2017, from eight months in 2014, as a result of the central bank providing foreign currency liquidity support to the economy”.

Elsewhere, EUR/RUB was up 0.81% to 54.48, from 54.04 late Tuesday.

NZD/USD hit a daily low of 0.7801 on Friday, the weakest level since October 8, before subsequently consolidating at 0.7855 by close of trade on Friday, up 0.42% for the day but still 0.78% lower for the week.
The pair is likely to find support at 0.7782, the low from October 8, and resistance at 0.7928, the high from October 23.

Data from the Commodities Futures Trading Commission released Friday showed that speculators scaled back their bearish bets on the New Zealand dollar in the week ending October 21.

53,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 26, 2014 09:05AM ET</span>",Forex - USD/JPY weekly outlook: October 27 - 31,"Investing.com - The dollar ended slightly lower against the traditional safe haven yen on Friday as concerns over a confirmed Ebola diagnosis in New York City spurred increased demand for the Japanese currency.
USD/JPY was down 0.12% to 108.14 late Friday, after falling as low as 107.77 earlier in the session. 
The dollar slid against the yen after a doctor in New York tested positive for the Ebola virus after returning from Guinea. The news fuelled concerns that a widespread outbreak of the virus could derail global economic growth.
The dollar later pulled away from session lows after data showed that U.S. new home sales rose 0.2% from a month earlier to hit a six year high of 467,000 in September.
The pair still ended the week with gains as the diverging monetary policy stance between the Federal Reserve and Japan’s central bank continued to underpin dollar demand.
The US dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.19% to 85.79 late Friday. The index still ended the week higher, stabilizing following a steep selloff in the previous week.
Fears that a slowdown in global economic growth could act as a drag on the U.S. economic recovery have prompted investors to push back expectations for an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve to the second half of 2015.
The Bank of Japan looks likely to stick to a looser monetary policy stance amid signs that the economic recovery in the world’s third-largest economy is faltering.
Japan’s government downgraded its assessment of the economic outlook for the second consecutive month last week, and a report earlier in the month showed that sentiment in the services sector deteriorated in the third quarter after a sales tax hike in April hit consumption.
Elsewhere, the euro was almost unchanged against the yen on Friday, with EUR/JPY trading at 137.01.
The single currency found support after the forward looking Gfk index of German consumer climate ticked up to 8.5 for November from a revised 8.4 in October. 
The index had fallen sharply in the preceding two months as concerns over geopolitical risks and the ensuing economic slowdown weighed.
In the week ahead investors will be looking ahead to the outcome of Wednesday’s Federal Reserve meeting amid expectations that it will wind up its asset purchase program. Investors will be scrutinizing the Fed statement for further indications on how soon interest rates could start to rise.
Data from Japan on retail sales, inflation and industrial production will also be closely watched, while Friday’s monetary policy announcement by the BoJ will also be in focus.

Still, the dollar didn't plunge, as a longer-range view of economic indicators still points to a sustained U.S. recovery, including in the housing sector.
Earlier in the week, the National Association of Realtors reported that U.S. existing home sales increased 2.4% to a 5.17 million units last month from 5.05 million in August. Analysts had expected existing home sales to rise 1% to 5.10 million units in September.
Elsewhere, a doctor who recently returned from Guinea tested positive for Ebola in New York City, which weakened the greenback on concerns that fears of a U.S. outbreak could slow growth.
Meanwhile in Europe, upbeat homegrown data gave the euro added support, which chipped away at the U.S. currency.
The Gfk German consumer climate index rose to 8.5 in October from 8.4 in September, whose figure was revised up from a previously estimated reading of 8.3.

The data reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in the second half of 2015 and calmed investor jitters at the end of a volatile week of trading.
The dollar fell to a five week trough against the yen mid-week and weakened against the other major currencies amid fears that slower global growth would act as a drag on the U.S. economy.
Demand for the yen was also hit by speculation that Japan’s pension fund is growing closer to increasing its holdings of stocks and overseas assets, which would drive up demand for foreign currencies.
The Nikkei newspaper said Monday that the $1.2 trillion Government Pension Investment Fund will raise its target for foreign bonds and shares to around 30% from 23%.
The euro was almost unchanged against the dollar, with EUR/USD at 1.2754, off the three-week highs of 1.2876 hit last Wednesday. The single currency was higher against the yen, with EUR/JPY advancing 0.26% to 136.74.
The US Dollar Index, which tracks the performance of the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, edged up 0.07% to 85.37, holding above last week’s three week lows of 84.53.

123,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2014 01:20AM ET</span>",Japan firms want government action if yen weakens: Reuters poll,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto 
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nearly half of Japanese firms think the government should start defending the yen at this month's dollar high of 110, a Reuters survey shows, underscoring the threat that rising fuel and other import costs pose to a fragile economy. 
Over the past two years, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has sought to boost the economy and cure deflation with bold monetary stimulus that has successfully wrought a much weaker yen. 
But the yen's descent against the greenback to a six-year low of 110.09 on Oct. 1 - a rapid 8 percent decline over three months - has prompted a chorus of complaints from companies that Abe's medicine could become poison. 
While the yen has since regained some ground to around 106 on expectations that the Federal Reserve may put off raising U.S. interest rates, the potential for further weakness is a major concern for many firms, the Reuters Corporate Survey showed. 
""If the yen is guided too weak, raw material costs jump and firms that can't pass on those costs become exhausted and find it hard to survive,"" wrote an executive at a paper company, one of the industries most affected by yen weakness. 
The survey, conducted from Sept. 30 to Oct. 14, found 45 percent of companies want the government to start talking up the yen or defend it with market intervention at around 110 to the dollar. That suggests that this level could become a key point at which corporate pressure on the government to do something about yen weakness intensifies. 
But it also found that some 23 percent of firms want action at around 115 yen and 20 percent prefer around 120 yen, with the remainder happy to wait for weaker levels. That suggests that authorities in export-reliant Japan will also be cautious in weighing the pros and cons of interfering in the market. 
The survey polled executives at 486 firms capitalized at more than 1 billion yen, who responded anonymously. About 240 firms answered questions on foreign exchange. 
EXTRA SENSITIVE 
Japan's sensitivity to yen weakness has become particularly heightened since 2011 Fukushima disaster led to the shutdown of its nuclear reactors, costing the country an estimated $28 billion in extra fuel imports annually. 
""That Japan cuts import costs by reining in energy imports is a matter of utmost urgency and in that sense, getting the nuclear reactors started is the nation's biggest political priority,"" wrote an executive at an electronics firm. 
This month's survey follows results last month that showed only one quarter of Japanese firms preferred an exchange rate of 105 yen or weaker. 
The yen's quick decline against the dollar in September prompted Finance Minister Taro Aso and other policymakers to warn that rapid moves in foreign exchange are undesirable though he added that the then levels of 108-109 were not that weak. 
Eisuke Sakakibara, who led both yen-selling and yen-buying interventions as Japan's currency czar in the 1990s, told Reuters this month that authorities would have to step in if the U.S. currency surged to between 115 and 120 yen, although he does not expect such a rapid decline at present. 
The last time Japanese authorities bought the yen was in 1998 when the dollar surged above 140, though economists caution that changes to the economy, including the impact of fuel costs and deflation mean that level cannot be seen as a yardstick today. 
Asked to forecast yen moves for the next 12 months, almost 60 percent of firms said they saw it moving between 100 and 110, while 35 percent projected a range of 110-120. 
The survey, conducted for Reuters by Nikkei Research, also showed that only 20 percent of firms think the economy - bruised by a sales tax hike this year - is ready to weather a second such tax hike planned for next year. Thirty-three percent say it won't cope while the rest declined to say either way. The result highlights a tough choice for Abe when he makes a final decision on the tax in December.

The Reserve Bank of Australia's monetary policy is currently configured to support demand growth through low interest rates that encourage spending and push up asset prices, Assistant Governor Christopher Kent said Monday.
""Low interest rates also encourage expenditure to be brought forward, provide an incentive for savers to shift into riskier, higher-return assets, and push up asset prices to the benefit of those that own housing and equities,"" Kent said in prepared remarks.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda Monday repeated the official outlook that the annual inflation rate measured in core consumer prices is likely to remain subdued at around 1.25% ""for some time.""
""Japan's economy has remained on a modest recovery trend, although production has been weak amid the pullback in demand after the consumption tax hike,"" Kuroda said in prepared remarks.
Kuroda said that the economy is expected to continue its moderate recovery as the the effects of an April sales tax hike wanes gradually.

134,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 17, 2014 03:12PM ET</span>",Dollar gains on improving U.S. consumer sentiment data,"Investing.com - A better-than-expected U.S. consumer sentiment report sent the dollar firming against most major currencies on Friday, as investors bet the Federal Reserve remains on track to close stimulus programs this month and raise interest rates in 2015.
In U.S. trading on Friday, EUR/USD was down 0.28% at 1.2772.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary consumer sentiment index rose to a seven-year high 86.4 for October from 84.6 in September. Analysts had expected the index to slip to 84.1 in October, and the surprise firmed the dollar.
Despite hiccups here and there, the U.S. economy is improving, and many investors are betting the Federal Reserve will conclude its monthly bond-buying program this month and raise interest rates in 2015, which should give the dollar support.
Elsewhere, the Census Bureau reported that U.S. building permits rose 1.5% to 1.018 million in September, disappointing expectations for an increase of 2.8% to 1.0.29 million units, after a 5.1% drop to 1.003 million units in August, which capped the greenback's gains.
The report also showed that U.S. housing starts rose 6.3% in September to 1.017 million units, beating expectations for a 4.8% gain. Housing starts for August were revised to a 12.8% fall from a previously estimated 14.4% decline.
Meanwhile, the euro continued to come under pressure amid growing concerns over the threat of deflation in the euro zone after revised data on Thursday showed that bloc's consumer price inflation rose by 0.3% in September, in line with expectations though soft nonetheless.
The rate has now been below 1% for 12 straight months, well under the European Central Bank's target of near but just under 2%.
The dollar was up against the yen, with USD/JPY up 0.33% at 106.69, and up against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF up 0.33% at 0.9457.
The greenback was down against the pound, with GBP/USD up 0.13% at 1.6110.
The dollar was mixed against its cousins in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, with USD/CAD up 0.15% at 1.1273, AUD/USD up 0.04% at 0.8760 and NZD/USD down 0.34% at 0.7926.
The loonie saw support after Statistics Canada reported that the country's consumer price index rose 0.1% last month, beating expectations for a flat reading and up from a flat reading in August.
Core consumer price inflation, which excludes the eight most volatile items, increased by 0.2% in September, more than the expected 0.1% rise, after a 0.5% gain the previous month.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.27% at 85.25.

A softer greenback makes oil a more attractive commodity on dollar-denominated exchanges, especially in the eyes of investors holding other currencies.
In the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil for delivery in November traded down 0.23% at $81.65 a barrel during U.S. trading. New York-traded oil futures hit a session low of $80.02 a barrel and a high of $82.44 a barrel.

Wednesday's data sent investors rethinking how fast the Federal Reserve will move to tighten policy in 2015, which battered the dollar and sent oil into positive territory earlier.
Oil later slid into negative territory on concerns global supply remains ample while demand may be waning, especially if the U.S. economy consumes less fuel and energy going forward.
Hopes for U.S. demand to offset Europe and Asia have supported oil in recent sessions, though fears of a softening U.S. recovery sent investors avoiding the commodity.
On Tuesday, the International Energy Agency trimmed its global oil demand forecast for the fourth month in a row, stoking fears that global supplies remain ample while demand cools across the globe.
The agency said it now expected global oil demand for 2014 to total 92.4 million barrels a day, down 200,000 barrels per day from its September report.
The IEA added that it believes that demand growth ""may have touched bottom"" and should steadily improve.

Prices of the virtual currency have recouped all of the losses suffered earlier in the month as investors returned to the market to seek cheap valuations.

Bitcoin (BTC/USD) advanced $4.66, or 1.25%, on Slovenia-based BitStamp to trade at $377.56 during U.S. morning hours. Bitcoin tumbled to an 11-month low of $275.00 on October 6.

According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which averages prices from the major exchanges, prices of the crypto-currency dipped 0.45% to trade at $374.50.
Prices of the virtual currency have recouped nearly all of the losses suffered earlier in the month as investors returned to the market to seek cheap valuations.
A number of traders and market analysts attributed the recent slide to price manipulation by short-term profiteers who are deliberately driving prices down to eventually buy them back at lows.
Meanwhile, euro-denominated Bitcoin prices (BTC/EUR) inched down €0.10, or 0.03%, to trade at €299.90 on U.S.-based Kraken Exchange.

Bitcoin is digital cash and is not backed by a government or central bank to regulate or issue it. It can be used to purchase goods and services from stores and online retailers.
Prices of the virtual currency are down nearly 45% from its June highs of $683, and roughly 70% below its all-time high near the $1,240-level hit in late November 2013.
Bitcoin’s market cap is down to just $4 billion, after peaking at $13.9 billion in December 2013, even as the virtual currency has been getting more popular with merchants and retailers in recent months, including PayPal, Expedia, Overstock.com and Dell.

207,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 10, 2014 03:50PM ET</span>",Dollar gains on global growth concerns,"Investing.com - The dollar strengthened against most major currencies on Friday amid safe-haven demand from investors concerned that while the U.S. may be recovering, the global economy continues to soften.
In U.S. trading on Friday, EUR/USD was down 0.59% at 1.2615.
The single currency continued to come under pressure on concerns the European economy is floundering and may require fresh ECB stimulus measures.
In Europe on Thursday, data revealed that Germany exports fell 5.8% in August, which took its toll on the single currency on Friday.
In France earlier, data revealed industrial production remained unchanged in August, better than expected 0.2% contraction, while Italy's figure expanded 0.3%, missing market calls for a 0.5% expansion
The euro slid on concerns monetary policy remains poised to loosen to steer the continent away from deflationary decline, as ECB President Mario Draghi has said monetary authorities will do what's necessary to kick start the European recovery.
Meanwhile in the U.S., import prices fell 0.5% in September from August, better than market calls for a 0.7% contraction, though still a decline nonetheless, a sign a stronger dollar and a softer global economy could water down inflationary pressures in the U.S.
Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve suggested rate hikes might not come as quickly than markets are expecting, though the dollar firmed anyway due to ongoing expectations for U.S. monetary policy to diverge from those in Europe and Asia.
The dollar was down against the yen, with USD/JPY down 0.06% at 107.77, and up against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF up 0.46% at 0.9584.
Earlier Friday, the minutes of the Bank of Japan's Sept. 3-4 policy meeting showed that some members voiced concerns over possible adverse effects of additional stimulus measures, which bolstered the yen.
These concerns raised the prospect of the first policy split vote under BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's mandate, even as the central bank head continues to emphasize his readiness to take fresh action to meet the BOJ's 2% inflation target, if needed.
On Tuesday, the BoJ left monetary policy unchanged at its policy meeting, but acknowledged that declining domestic demand as a result of a sales tax increase in April was leading to economic weakness.
Separately, official data on Friday showed that tertiary industry activity slipped 0.1% in August, confounding expectations for a 0.2% rise, after a 0.3% fall in July.
The greenback was up against the pound, with GBP/USD down 0.39% at 1.6054.
The dollar was up against its cousins in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, with USD/CAD up 0.25% at 1.1213, AUD/USD down 0.99% at 0.8696 and NZD/USD down 0.65% at 0.7812.
Statistics Canada reported earlier that the number of employed people rose by 74,1000 in September, blowing past expectations for an increase of 20,000, after a decline of 11,000 the previous month.
The report also showed that Canada's unemployment rate fell to 6.8% last month from 7.0% in August. Analysts had expected the unemployment rate to remain unchanged in September, and the report strengthened the loonie earlier though profit taking sent the currency back down.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.42% at 86.02.
On Friday, the U.S. is to round up the week with data on import prices.

Elsewhere, the euro was down against the pound, with EUR/GBP down 0.11% at 0.7870, and down against the yen, with EUR/JPY down 0.46% at 136.29.

Bitcoin (BTC/USD) tumbled to a daily low of $275.00 on Slovenia-based BitStamp, a level not seen since November 2013.
BitStamp prices recovered to last trade at $316.98 during U.S. morning hours, up $7.24, or 2.34%.
The price of a bitcoin on Bulgaria-based BTC-e rose $15.96, or 5.24%, to trade at $320.65, while prices on Singapore-based itBit tacked on $6.31, or 1.97%, to trade at $326.55.
According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which averages prices from the major exchanges, prices of the crypto-currency advanced 1.03% to trade at $322.94.
Bitcoin sank by as much as $99.62, or 26.6%, over the weekend to hit an 11-month low, as bearish chart signals and concerns about possible regulation of the virtual currency weighed.
The downward move came amid heavy volume but without any obvious trigger.
A number of traders and market analysts attributed the plunge to price manipulation by short-term profiteers who are deliberately driving prices down to eventually buy them back at lows.
Meanwhile, euro-denominated Bitcoin prices (BTC/EUR) dipped €0.30, or 0.12%, to trade at €257.70 on U.S.-based Kraken Exchange.
Elsewhere, yuan-denominated Bitcoin prices picked up CNY112.33, or 5.88%, to trade at CNY2,022.44 yuan on Beijing-based OKCoin, while prices on Shanghai-based BTC China advanced CNY52.95, or 2.69%, to trade at CNY2,023.75.

Prices of the virtual currency are down nearly 55% from its June highs of $683, and roughly 75% below its all-time high near the $1,240-level hit in late November 2013.
Bitcoin’s market cap is down to just $4 billion, after peaking at $13.9 billion in December 2013, even as the virtual currency has been getting more popular with merchants and retailers in recent months.

In U.S. trading on Friday, GBP/USD was down 1.14% at 1.5932, up from a session low of 1.5953 and off a high of 1.6159.
Cable was likely to find support at 1.5852, the low from Nov. 12, 2013, and resistance at 1.6288, Tuesday's high.
The Department of Labor reported earlier that the U.S. economy added 248,000 jobs in September, far more than the expected 215,000 increase. The number of jobs created in August was revised to 180,000 from a previous estimate of 142,000.
In addition, the U.S. unemployment rate ticked down to 5.9% last month from 6.1% in August.
Analysts had expected the rate to remain unchanged, and the numbers boosted the dollar by cementing expectations for the Federal Reserve to close its monthly bond-buying program later this month and begin hiking interest rates in 2015 sooner than once anticipated.
Elsewhere, the Institute of Supply Management said its non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index slipped to 58.6 in September from a reading of 59.6 in August. Analysts had expected the index to fall to 58.5 last month.
A separate report showed that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $40.10 billion in August from $40.30 billion in July, whose figure was revised from a previously estimated deficit of $40.60 billion.
Analysts had expected the trade deficit to widen to $40.90 billion in August.

Separately, the Commerce Department said that U.S. personal spending rose 0.5% in August, beating expectations for an increase of 0.4%, after a 0.1% dip in July.
The report also showed that personal income, reflecting income from wages, investment, and government aid, rose 0.3%, up from 0.2% in July, broadly in line with forecasts.
On Friday, the dollar advanced after the Commerce Department said U.S. gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 4.6% in the second quarter, in line with the consensus forecast.
In Japan last week, data showed that the country's consumer price index rose at an annualized rate of 3.3% this month, missing expectations for a 3.4% increase.
Core consumer price inflation, which excludes fresh food, rose 3.1% in September from a year earlier, missing expectations for an increase of 3.2%.
The yen remained soft ahead of a slew of economic indicators due out this week.
Later this week, Japan is to publish reports on household spending, retail sales and average earnings, as well as preliminary data on industrial production.
Also this week, Japan is to publish the results of its Tankan manufacturing and services indices, and uncertainty surrounding the data gave the dollar an edge over the yen.
Elsewhere this week, the U.S. is to publish data on business activity in the Chicago region and a report on consumer confidence.
The U.S. is to release the ADP report on private sector job creation, which leads the government’s nonfarm payrolls report by two days.
The Institute of Supply Management is to release a report on manufacturing activity.
The yen, meanwhile, was down against the euro and down against the pound, with EUR/JPY up 0.21% at 138.89, and GBP/JPY trading up 0.19% at 177.85.

In U.S. trading on Friday, EUR/USD was down 0.57% at 1.2677.
The dollar advanced after the Commerce Department said U.S. gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 4.6% in the second quarter, in line with the consensus forecast, after contracting by 2.1% in the first three months of the year.
U.S. second quarter GDP was initially reported to have increased by 4.2%.
The positive data fueled already growing expectations for rate hikes to kick in earlier next year than once anticipated.
On Thursday, Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher said that the U.S. central bank may start raising interest rates around the spring of 2015, earlier than many market expectations.
Separately, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final consumer sentiment index remained unchanged at 84.6 this month, just shy of expectations for an uptick to 84.7.
The euro, meanwhile, continued to come under pressure after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi reiterated on Thursday the bank's commitment to act with more policy measures to boost inflation in the euro zone.
A day earlier, Mario Draghi had already vowed to keep monetary policy ""accommodative"" for as long as needed, and to use every tool at the ECB's disposal to fight deflation.
Elsewhere on Friday, data revealed that the Gfk German consumer climate index ticked down to 8.3 this month from 8.6 in August. Analysts had expected the index to slip to 8.5, and the weaker-than-expected figure softened the single currency alongside robust U.S. data.
The dollar was up against the yen, with USD/JPY up 0.51% at 109.29, and up against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF up 0.52% at 0.9516.
The greenback was up against the pound, with GBP/USD down 0.43% at 1.6246.

364,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 25, 2014 12:00PM ET</span>","Forex - EUR/USD nears 22-month lows on U.S. data, Fed comments","Investing.com - The euro flirted with 22-month lows against a firming dollar on Thursday after data revealed fewer in the U.S. sought first-time joblessness assistance last week, while hawkish comments out of the Federal Reserve boosted demand for the greenback as well.
In U.S. trading, EUR/USD was down 0.37% at 1.2733, up from a session low of 1.2700 and off a high of 1.2784.
The pair was likely to find support at 1.2688, the low from Nov. 16, 2012, and resistance at 1.2903, Tuesday's high.
The U.S. Labor Department reported earlier that the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending Sept. 20 rose by 12,000 to 293,000, up from the previous week's revised total of 281,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 19,000 to 300,000 last week, and the better-than-expected number drew applause for the greenback.
Separately, official data showed that U.S. durable goods orders dropped by 18.2% in August, after an increase of 22.5% in July, whose figure was revised down from a previously estimated gain of 22.6%. Analysts had expected durable goods orders to decline by 18.0% last month, and the in-line figure also gave the dollar room to firm.
Core durable goods orders, which are stripped of volatile transportation items, rose 0.7% last month, in line with expectations, after falling 0.5% in July, whose figure was revised from a previously estimated 0.7% drop.
The dollar saw added support after Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher said the U.S. central bank may start raising benchmark interest rates around the spring of 2015, earlier than many market expectations.
While the Fed has suggested its bond-buying program could close in October, uncertainty remains as to when rate hikes may begin in 2015.
The euro, meanwhile, came under pressure after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi reiterated on Thursday the bank's commitment to act with more policy measures to boost inflation in the euro zone.
""We stand ready to use additional unconventional instruments within our mandate, and alter the size or composition of our unconventional interventions should it become necessary to further address risks of a too prolonged period of low inflation,"" Draghi said.
A day earlier, Mario Draghi had already vowed to keep monetary policy ""accommodative"" for as long as needed, and to use every tool at the ECB's disposal to fight deflation.
Elsewhere, the euro was down against the pound, with EUR/GBP down 0.13% at 0.7812, and down against the yen, with EUR/JPY down 0.56% at 138.58.
On Friday, markets will move on U.S. gross domestic product and consumer-sentiment data as well as a German report on consumer climate.

419,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 21, 2014 09:11AM ET</span>",Forex - AUD/USD weekly outlook: September 22 - 26,"Investing.com - The Australian dollar slumped to a more than six-month low against its U.S. counterpart on Friday, as growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will begin to raise rates sooner than previously thought boosted demand for the greenback.
AUD/USD hit a daily low of 0.8921 on Friday, a level not seen since March 4, before subsequently consolidating at 0.9038 by close of trade, down 0.66% for the day and 1.19% lower for the week.
The pair is likely to find support at 0.8888, the low from March 3 and resistance at 0.8995, the high from September 18.
The Federal Reserve cut its monthly bond-buying program by another $10 billion following its two-day policy meeting on September 17, keeping the program on track to finish next month.
While the Fed reiterated that it expects rates to remain on hold for a ""considerable time"" after its quantitative easing program ends, it also projected a faster pace of rate hikes.
For the end of 2015, the median forecast was 1.375% compared to a June forecast of 1.125%.
Speaking at the central bank’s post-policy meeting press conference, Fed Chair Janet Yellen emphasized that the timing of the first rate hike would be data-dependent.
Meanwhile, in the minutes of its September policy meeting published on September 16, the Reserve Bank of Australia reiterated its decision to keep interest rates on hold for an extended period of time and added that the exchange rate remains ""above most estimates of its fundamental value.""
Data from the Commodities Futures Trading Commission released Friday showed that speculators decreased their bullish bets on the Australian dollar in the week ending September 16.
Net longs totaled 22,140 contracts, down from net longs of 41,229 in the preceding week.
In the week ahead, investors will be focusing on U.S. data on new and existing home sales, as well as reports on durable goods orders and initial jobless claims.

420,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 21, 2014 08:48AM ET</span>",Forex - USD/CAD weekly outlook: September 22 - 26,"Investing.com - The broadly stronger U.S. dollar gained ground against the Canadian dollar on Friday, despite data showing that the annual rate of core inflation in Canada rose at the fastest rate in over two years last month.
USD/CAD was up 0.14% to 1.0951 in late trade, off highs of 1.0980.
Demand for the greenback continued to be underpinned as indications that the economic recovery is making solid progress fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates sooner than markets are expecting.
On Wednesday the Fed offered fresh guidance on its plans to raise interest rates, outlining in more detail how it will start to raise short term interest rates when the time comes.
The Fed statement reiterated that it expects rates to remain on hold for a ""considerable time"", after its bond purchasing program ends, while Chair Janet Yellen stressed that the timing of any change in interest rates is dependent on the strength of the economic recovery.
The Fed also cut its monthly asset purchase program by another $10 billion, keeping the program on track to finish next month.
The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is also known, found some support after official data showed that the annual core inflation rate, which excludes volatile items such as some food and energy costs, rose 2.1% in August. It was the highest level since April 2012, and outstripped forecasts for a 1.8% increase.
The annual headline rate of inflation rose 2.1% last month, in line with forecasts and unchanged from July.
The strong increase in core inflation boosted expectations that the Bank of Canada may shift away from its neutral stance on interest rates sooner than expected. 
Earlier in the week, BoC Governor Stephen Poloz said he was in no hurry to move away from the central bank's neutral rate stance amid indications that a slow recovery in Canadian exports is underway.
The week ahead will bring a fresh look at the U.S. housing sector, with reports on both new and existing home sales, as well as Thursday’s data on durable goods orders and initial jobless claims.

In U.S. trading on Friday, EUR/USD was down 0.67% at 1.2837.
The dollar rallied against the euro on expectations for U.S. and European monetary policies to diverge.
Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve suggested it plans to close its bond-buying stimulus program next month and hike interest rates in 2015.
While some time will pass between those two policy moves, rate hikes could come quickly once the U.S. central bank moves to tighten, investors have concluded, which bolstered the greenback.
Meanwhile across the Atlantic, the euro came under pressure after the European Central Bank on Thursday said it allotted €82.6 billion to 255 bidders in its new Targeted Long Term Refinancing Operation, or TLTRO. The figure was well below the €100 to €150 billion predicted by analysts.
The European Central Bank recently cut interest rates and announced it would purchase asset-backed securities to stimulate the economy, which has softened the euro.
Elsewhere, market talk that the Bank of Japan bought one-year government debt at negative yields softened the yen, which added to the greenback's appeal.
While the BoJ has bought three- and six-month bills at negative yields in the past, the decision to buy one-year debt that will lose money added to market speculation that monetary authorities are ramping up their efforts to stimulate the economy and reach a 2% inflation target.
The dollar was up against the yen, with USD/JPY up 0.23% at 108.94, and up against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF up 0.72% at 0.9404.
The greenback was up against the pound, with GBP/USD down 0.54% at 1.6309.
The pound strengthened earlier after Scottish voters rejected a referendum on independence and opted to remain part of the United Kingdom.
A record turnout of voters delivered a clear victory for the No campaign on Thursday, with 55% of Scottish voters rejecting independence and 45% backing it.
The pound later fell against the greenback, as many investors had already priced a No victory and sold sterling for profits.

EUR/CHF was trading at 1.2080 following the announcement, still down 0.20% for the day but off lows of 1.2066 struck ahead of the SNB statement.
The Swiss franc was boosted after the SNB stopped short of taking fresh measures to stem the appreciation of the franc.
Switzerland’s central bank kept its interest rate target unchanged at zero to 0.25% and also kept the exchange rate floor unchanged at 1.20 francs per euro.
In its rate statement the SNB said it “will continue to enforce the minimum exchange rate with the utmost determination. For this purpose, it is prepared to purchase foreign currency in unlimited quantities. If necessary, it will take further measures immediately""
The bank said the economic outlook has deteriorated considerably and the Swiss franc is “still high.”
The bank cut its inflation forecast for 2015 and 2016, and said it now expects 2014 GDP growth of 1.5%, down from 2% in June.
The SNB imposed the 1.20 per euro exchange rate floor in September 2011 in order to ward off the risk of deflation and a recession as a result of the franc’s rapid appreciation.
The franc has approached that level in recent sessions as the euro weakened after the European Central Bank unexpectedly cut rates to record lows on September 4 and unveiled new easing measures in a bid to shore up inflation.
The franc gained approximately 0.9% against the euro during August, prompting the SNB to reiterate that it would defend its cap on the franc by buying unlimited amounts of foreign currency if necessary.
The franc also gained ground against the dollar, with USD/CHF down 0.45% to 0.9369, off the more than one year highs of 0.9432 struck earlier in the session.
Demand for the dollar continued to be underpinned after the Federal Reserve offered fresh guidance on its plans to raise interest rates after its monetary policy meeting on Wednesday.
The Fed statement reiterated that it expects rates to remain on hold for a ""considerable time"", after its bond purchasing program ends, but it outlined in more detail how it will start to raise short term interest rates when the time comes.
The Fed cut its monthly asset purchase program by another $10 billion, keeping the program on track to finish next month.

USD/RUB was last up 1.05% for the day to 38.19. This takes the dollar’s year-to-date gains against the rouble to 16.1%.
The new sanctions imposed by the U.S. and the European Union on Friday targeted major Russian oil and energy companies and banks. The measures are in response to what the U.S. and the E.U. say is Moscow's role in the separatist conflict in Ukraine.
The Bank of Russia left interest rates on hold at its latest meeting on Friday, adding to pressure on the rouble. Several rounds of sanctions already imposed have weakened the currency and caused a spike in inflation.
The central bank warned that sanctions will have ""a prolonged impact"" on the economy but said that it will target no economic indicators other than inflation, indicating that rates are unlikely to rise despite concerns over the economic impact of the Ukraine crisis.
Weaker oil prices also weighed on the rouble. Brent oil futures fell to two-year lows on Monday as weak Chinese economic data fuelled concerns over a slowdown in the global demand outlook.
Oil and gas exports make up approximately two-thirds of all Russia’s total exports.Emerging market currencies remained under pressure as growing expectations for an early hike in U.S. interest rates continued to bolster investor demand for the greenback.
The Fed was expected to cut its asset purchase program by another $10 billion at its upcoming policy meeting on Wednesday, which would keep it on track for winding up the program in October, and to start raising interest rates sometime in mid-2015.
Emerging market economies are particularly vulnerable to increases in U.S. interest rates, due to their dependence on foreign investment to fund current-account deficits.

509,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 12, 2014 04:01PM ET</span>",Dollar extends gains on rate hike prospects ,"Investing.com - The dollar traded largely higher against most major currencies on Friday amid expectations the Federal Reserve next week will trim its bond-buying program and release a monetary policy statement possibly hinting at when benchmark interest rates may rise.
In U.S. trading on Friday, EUR/USD was up 0.23% at 1.2952, mainly as investors felt the greenback had risen too high against the single currency in recent sessions and sold the dollar for profits.
The euro has come under pressure in recent sessions on expectations for European and U.S. monetary policies to diverge.
While the European Central Bank recently cut interest rates and announced plans to purchase asset-backed securities to shore up the economy, the Federal Reserve is expected to close its bond-buying program next month and begin hiking interest rates in 2015, likely sooner than once anticipated.
The Fed will meet next week to review monetary policy, and markets are hoping for hints as to when benchmark interest rates will rise.
The Fed is also expected to cut its quantitative easing program to $10 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities purchased each month from $15 billion before closing the program in October.
Still, by Friday investors felt the greenback's gains over the single currency grown somewhat frothy, and sold the U.S. currency for profits despite upbeat U.S. data.

In U.S. trading, EUR/USD was up 0.15% at 1.2937, up from a session low of 1.2897 and off a high of 1.2952.
The pair was likely to find support at 1.2858, Tuesday's low, and resistance at 1.2962, Wednesday's high.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported earlier that the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending Sept. 6 increased by 11,000 to a 10-week high of 315,000 from the previous week’s revised total of 304,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to fall by 4,000 to 300,000 last week, and the figure gave investors room to sell the greenback for profits.
The dollar still remained strong against the euro and most other currencies historically, as the labor market has shown consistent improvement this year.
Furthermore, the labor market often appears weaker than it really is in August due to seasonal factors, while factory, service-sector, gross domestic product and other data all point to a U.S. recovery that is gaining steam, with hiccups here and there.
The Federal Reserve will conclude a two-day policy meeting next week, and markets expect the monetary authority to cut its monthly bond-buying program by $10 billion to $15 billion, with some hoping for language hinting at when interest rates may rise.
A Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco report published on Monday suggested rate hikes may come sooner than markets may be expecting.
Elsewhere, the euro was up against the pound, with EUR/GBP up 0.04% at 0.7972, and up against the yen, with EUR/JPY up 0.18% at 138.28.
On Friday, more heavy-hitting data will publish.
The U.S. is to release data on retail sales, the government measure of consumer spending, which accounts for the majority of overall economic activity.

The yen also remained under pressure after after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said earlier Thursday that the central bank would be prepared to immediately loosen monetary policy or implement other measures if its 2% inflation target becomes difficult to meet.

Bitcoin (BTC/USD) slumped $7.71, or 1.6%, on Slovenia-based BitStamp to trade at $475.28 during U.S. morning hours.
A day earlier, prices rose to a session high of $490.74, before moving lower to settle at $476.57.
Bitcoin prices were likely to find support at $456.30, the low from September 8, and resistance at $497.00, the high from September 4.
Elsewhere, the price of a Bitcoin on Bulgaria-based BTC-e shed $4.99, or 1.05%, to trade at $470.00.
According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which averages prices from the major exchanges, prices of the crypto-currency slipped 0.34% to trade at $475.91.
Prices of the virtual currency remained supported after EBay announced on September 8 that Braintree, the company’s payment processor unit, would begin accepting Bitcoin in the “coming months.”
EBay, the world’s biggest online marketplace, is the most significant business to date that’s embraced bitcoin. Dell, Dish Networks, Overstock.com and Expedia also began accepting the virtual currency earlier in the year.
Meanwhile, euro-denominated Bitcoin prices (BTC/EUR) tacked on €0.21, or 0.06%, to trade at €369.00 on U.S.-based Kraken Exchange.
Bitcoin exchange Coinbase announced on Wednesday that it was expanding into 13 European countries, allowing users with European bank accounts to now buy and sell bitcoins in exchange for euros.
The move marks bitcoin's accelerating adoption, and will add to the company's already 1.6M customer accounts.
Bitcoin is digital cash and is not backed by a government or central bank to regulate or issue it. It can be used to purchase goods and services from stores and online retailers.

EUR/CHF was last trading at 1.2097, not far from Wednesday’s three week peaks of 1.2117.
The pair was likely to find support at the 1.2070 level and resistance at around 1.2120.
The Swiss franc fell to three week lows against the euro on Wednesday after Swiss National Bank official Thomas Moser said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that negative interest rates would be used if needed.
The SNB imposed the 1.20 per euro exchange rate floor in September 2011 in order to ward off the risk of deflation and a recession as a result of the franc’s rapid appreciation.
The franc has approached that level in recent sessions as the euro weakened after the European Central Bank unexpectedly cut rates to record lows on September 4 and unveiled new easing measures in a bid to shore up inflation.
The franc gained approximately 0.9% against the euro during August, prompting the SNB to reiterate that it would defend its cap on the franc by buying unlimited amounts of foreign currency if necessary.
SNB President Thomas Jordan has warned that an appreciation of the franc would heighten the risk of negative price growth.
Earlier this month Jordan said the franc is “still highly valued” and added that maintaining the exchange rate cap is “absolutely central to ensure adequate monetary conditions in Switzerland”.

The pair was likely to find support at the 106.00 level and resistance at around 107.25.
Expectations that the Federal Reserve is growing closer to raising interest rates have boosted the dollar against the euro and the yen, as the European and Japanese central banks look likely to stick to a looser monetary policy stance.
The Fed was expected to cut its asset purchase program by another $10 billion at its upcoming policy meeting next week which would keep it on track for winding up the program in October, and to start raising interest rates sometime in mid-2015.
A study by the San Francisco Fed published on Monday indicated that central bank officials see rates rising earlier than markets expect.
Weak economic data from earlier in the week also continued to weigh on the yen.
Data on Monday showed that Japan’s second quarter economic contraction was larger than initially estimated, and another report showed that the country’s current account surplus fell short of expectations in July.
The lackluster data indicated the economy is struggling to gain momentum and fuelled expectations for more stimulus from the Bank of Japan.
The euro edged lower against the dollar, with EUR/USD dipping 0.07% to 1.2929, holding above the 14-month lows of 1.2858 set on Tuesday.
The euro remained weaker after the European Central Bank unexpectedly cut rates to record lows across the euro zone last week and unveiled new easing measures in a bid to shore up the faltering recovery and boost inflation.

In U.S. trading on Friday, EUR/USD was up 0.07% at 1.2954.
The Department of Labor reported earlier that the U.S. economy added 142,000 jobs in August, far less than the expected increase of 225,000. July's figure was revised to a 212,000 increase from a previously estimated rise of 209,000.
The report also showed that the U.S. unemployment rate ticked down to 6.1% last month, from 6.2%, in line with expectations.
The data came a day after payroll processor ADP reported that its nonfarm payrolls report showed that the private sector added 204,000 jobs in August, missing expectations for jobs growth of 220,000 though still above the 200,000 mark.
Still, the dollar didn't plummet on the news, as the August jobs report tends to be subject to hefty revisions later in the year.
Still, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has said that slackness persists in the labor market despite an improving economy, which softened demand for the greenback.
Meanwhile in Europe, official data revealed that German industrial production rose 1.9% in July, beating expectations for an uptick of 0.3%, after a revised 0.4% increase in June.
Still, the euro continued to come under pressure in wake of a European Central Bank decision to trim its benchmark interest rate to a record-low 0.05% from 0.15% on Thursday.
The central bank also lowered its deposit facility rate to -0.20% from -0.10% previously and its marginal lending rate to 0.30% from 0.40%.
The European monetary authority will also begin an asset-backed securities purchasing program to shore up the recovery and steer the continent away from deflationary decline.
The ECB cut its forecast for growth this year to 0.9% down from 1.0% previously and cut the forecast for 2015 to 1.6% from 1.7%. The bank also lowered its inflation forecast for this year to 0.6% from 0.7% in June.

628,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 03, 2014 06:38AM ET</span>",Forex - Russian rouble gains after Ukraine ceasefire agreed,"Investing.com - The Russian rouble moved sharply higher against the dollar on Wednesday after Kiev announced that a ""permanent ceasefire"" in eastern Ukraine had been reached.
USD/RUB touched session lows of 36.79 and was last down 1.37% to 36.93. The pair rose to an all-time high of 37.51 on Monday as concerns over the prospect of fresh sanctions loomed.
The rouble rallied after Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko said he had agreed on a ""permanent ceasefire"" with eastern Ukraine with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
However, a spokesman for President Putin subsequently said he had not agreed to a ceasefire as Russia was not party to the conflict but added that the two leaders had ""discussed how to end the conflict"".
The conflict broke out in March after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region.
Ukraine and the West blamed Russian military support for gains by pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine in recent days, claiming that Russian troops had entered the conflict to support them.
Over the weekend European Union leaders threatened to impose a fresh round of sanctions on Russia if Moscow did not end its support for the rebels.
The rouble was also higher against the euro, with EUR/RUB last down 1.22% to 48.58, off Monday’s record highs of 48.71.
Concerns that sanctions against Russia would act as a drag on growth in the euro zone have pressured the single currency lower in recent weeks.
EUR/USD rose to session highs of 1.3156 following reports of the ceasefire and was last up 0.12% to 1.3149, holding above Tuesday’s one year lows of 1.3109.
Sentiment on the single currency remained fragile ahead of the European Central Bank’s monthly meeting on Thursday.
The euro fell to one year lows against the dollar on Tuesday amid mounting expectations that the ECB will announce quantitative easing measures as a way to shore up growth after the annual rate of euro area inflation slowed to a five year low last month.
Data on Wednesday showed that activity in the German and French service sectors slowed in August, while Italy’s service sector contracted, adding to pressure on the bank to act.

The ECB targets an inflation rate of close to but just under 2%.
Concerns that sanctions against Russia would act as a drag on growth in the euro zone have also weighed on the single currency in recent weeks.

EUR/CHF was trading at 1.2063, not far from last Thursday’s trough of 1.2048, the lowest level since early December 2012.
In a newspaper interview published on Sunday, SNB President Thomas Jordan pledged to enforce the minimum 1.20 per euro exchange rate floor imposed by the bank three years ago, warning that an appreciation of the franc would heighten the risk of negative price growth.
Jordan said the franc is “still highly valued” and added that maintaining the 1.20 per euro exchange rate cap is “absolutely central to ensure adequate monetary conditions in Switzerland”.
The SNB imposed the cap on the euro exchange rate in September 2011 in order to ward off the risk of deflation and a recession as a result of the franc’s rapid appreciation.
Expectations for quantitative easing by the European Central Bank have been mounting in recent weeks, while rising geopolitical tensions, such as the conflict in Ukraine, have bolstered safe haven inflows to the franc.
The annual rate of inflation in the euro zone slowed to a five year low of 0.3% last month, adding to pressure on the ECB to take additional measures to shore up long-term inflation expectations.

706,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 27, 2014 06:50AM ET</span>",Bitcoin prices rise 2% to trade above $520,"Investing.com - Bitcoin prices firmed above the key $500-level on Wednesday, as prices of the virtual currency continued to recover from sharp losses suffered earlier in the month.
Bitcoin (BTC/USD) rallied 2.23%, or $11.38, on Slovenia-based BitStamp to trade at $521.38 during U.S. morning hours. Prices rose to a session high of $523.09, the most since August 22.
Elsewhere, the price of a Bitcoin on Bulgaria-based BTC-e tacked on 1.08%, or $5.50, to trade at $513.45.
According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which averages prices from the major exchanges, prices of the crypto-currency rose 1.17% to trade at $519.47.
Meanwhile, euro-denominated Bitcoin prices (BTC/EUR) climbed 1.17%, or €4.53, to trade at €393.53 on U.S.-based Kraken Exchange.
Prices of the virtual currency have moved higher in recent sessions, following sharp losses suffered earlier in the month.
Market analysts have blamed various events for the downward trend, including a recent U.S. government report that highlights the risks associated with virtual currencies, New York's BitLicense proposals, and the introduction of new sophisticated trading techniques.
A number of traders and market participants also attributed the recent decline to price manipulation by short-term profiteers who are deliberately driving prices down to eventually buy them back at lows.
Global financial services provider Citigroup (NYSE:C) said in a research note published Tuesday that bitcoin’s price is poised for “acute instability” due to an oversupply of coins from miners and large merchants, along with a weak growth in demand.
The analysis points to the increased sophistication and cost of mining as a major driver for growth in bitcoin supply.
The reports adds that merchants that accept Bitcoin payments, such as Dell and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), are converting any bitcoin they receive from customers into dollar or euros, putting further selling pressure on the bitcoin price.
Bitcoin is digital cash and is not backed by a government or central bank to regulate or issue it. It can be used to purchase goods and services from stores and online retailers.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro hit its lowest level against the dollar in nearly a year and euro zone government bond yields fell to record lows on Tuesday on expectations the European Central Bank might ease monetary policy as soon as next week.
The single currency fell as low as $1.3178 in Asian trade, its weakest since Sept. 9, before recovering slightly, in response to ECB chief Mario Draghi's comments last week that he was ready to use all available tools if euro zone inflation fell further. Draghi also called for fiscal policy to play a greater role in reviving the economy.
The next ECB policy meeting is on Sept. 4. Preliminary euro zone data due on Friday are forecast to show annual inflation was just 0.3 percent this month, down from 0.4 percent in July, well below the ECB's target of just under 2 percent.
""If it is confirmed over the next few weeks and months that inflation goes closer to zero, they (the ECB) will have to buy everything they can and inflate the balance sheet,"" said Frederik Ducrozet, senior euro zone economist at Credit Agricole. ""There is no other option.""
European shares rose, extending gain made on Monday in trained thinned by a UK market holiday. The FTSEurofirst 300 index (FTEU3) was last up 0.4 percent at 1,371.34.
The prospect of looser ECB policy and possibly further stimulus helped lift shares in Asia and Wall Street. The S&P 500 (SPX) topped 2,000 for the first time and on Monday looked set to open higher. S&P 500 EMini futures were up 0.2 percent.
Emerging-market stocks (MSCIEF) hit a three-year high on expectations of inflows if the ECB eases policy. However, Russian shares fell (MCX) before talks in Belarus, where presidents Vladimir Putin of Russia and Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine were meeting in talks over conflict in eastern Ukraine.
The dollar index , which measures the greenback against a currency basket, hit a one-year high in New York before falling back to trade less than 0.1 percent lower.
The euro <EUR=> was last at $1.3196, up 0.1 percent on the day. The yen <JPY=> rose a similar amount at 103.90 to the dollar.
FIRMER YEN
The firmer yen took a toll on shares in Japanese exporters. The Nikkei index (N225) closed down 0.6 percent.
German government bond yields <DE10YT=TWEB>, which hit a record low of 0.926 percent on Monday before pulling back, fell 1.5 basis points on Tuesday to 0.94 percent. Two-year yields <DE2YT=TWEB> edged up but remained negative at -0.04 percent.
""Euro/dollar is vulnerable to testing new lows. A downtrend is easily formed given the opposite directions Fed and ECB monetary policies are seemingly headed,"" said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale in Tokyo.
French President Francois Hollande's call on Monday for a cabinet reshuffle, after leftist rebel ministers argued for a U-turn on economic policy, had also helped push yields and the euro lower. A new government was expected to be announced on Tuesday.
Yields on peripheral euro zone debt, which the ECB could buy to pump money into the region's lackluster economy as part of an asset-purchase scheme known as quantitative easing, also fell. Italian and Spanish 10-year yields <IT10YT=TWEB><ES10YT=TWEB> fell to new record lows.
U.S. Treasury yields fell in line with euro zone debt. Ten-year bonds (US10YT=RR) dropped 1.4 bps to 2.38 percent.
Brent crude oil futures edged up towards $103 a barrel, although a glut of supply and weak economic data in major consumer countries curbed gains.

Gold rose 1 percent, though expectations of buoyant U.S. data later in the day capped gains. Spot gold <XAU=> last traded at $1,286.40 an ounce, off a high for the day of $1,290.80.

A number of traders and market analysts also attributed the recent decline to price manipulation by short-term profiteers who are deliberately driving prices down to eventually buy them back at lows.

738,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2014 05:10AM ET</span>","Euro falls, stocks rise on ECB stimulus bet","By Francesco Canepa
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro fell to a near one-year low against the dollar and euro zone stocks and bonds rallied on Monday as investors positioned for rising chances of further policy easing by the European Central Bank.
ECB President Mario Draghi said late on Friday that the bank was prepared to respond with all its available tools should inflation in the euro zone drop further.
Investors speculated this meant the ECB was more likely to embark on an asset purchase program, or quantitative easing, or adopt other stimulus measures in coming months which would weigh on the euro and boost assets such as stocks and bonds.
""The key message is that Draghi stands ready for more action if needed,"" Franz Wenzel, chief strategist at AXA Investment Managers in Paris, said.
""Whether they're going to do quantitative easing remains to be seen but we're fairly confident that the financial engineers at the ECB will find other tools. At this juncture, we don't exclude quantitative easing at the end of this year.""
A weak German business sentiment index, Ifo, also added pressure on the euro in European trade, as it reinforced concerns about Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy.
The euro skidded to $1.3185 <EUR=> in early Asian trade, its lowest since September 2013, from around $1.3246 late in New York on Friday. It was last trading at $1.3190, down about 0.3 percent on the day, amid lower than usual volumes due to a holiday in London.
The euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index (STOXX50E) was up 1.2 percent to 3,135.38 points after climbing to a three-week high in early deals. Both Germany's DAX (GDAXI) and France's CAC 40 (FCHI) gained 1.2 percent.
The MSCI All-Country World index (MIWD00000PUS) was up 0.1 percent at 429.03 points.
Spanish <ES10YT=TWEB> and Italian <IT10YT=TWEB> 10-year yields fell 8 bps to 2.31 percent and 2.51 percent, respectively, while Portuguese yields <PT10YT=TWEB> fell 14 bps to 3.12 percent.
""The ... market has interpreted Draghi's statement as meaning that broad-based asset purchases, or quantitative easing, has now become more likely,"" said Lutz Karpowitz, currency strategist at Commerzbank.
The Ifo business climate index dropped for a fourth straight month in August and the Ifo Institute said it was likely to cut its 2014 growth forecast for Germany to 1.5 percent from 2 percent.
Also sounding dovish was Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda who vowed over the weekend to press ahead with aggressive monetary easing for as long as needed to convince the public that deflation was dead and buried.
Kuroda's pledges of policy stimulus weighed on the yen <JPY=>, which was down 0.1 percent against the dollar.
US RATES SEEN RISING EARLIER
In contrast, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Friday gave a nod to the concerns of some Fed officials about the sustained level of monetary policy stimulus, even as she stressed the need to move cautiously on raising rates.
As a result, Fed funds futures fell back <0#FF:> as the market priced in the risk of an earlier rise in interest rates, while the dollar index rose to 82.563, its highest since September last year.
U.S. T-note futures were flat at 125-57/64, with cash 10-year yields (US10YT=RR) trading at 2.41 percent.
In commodities markets, the rising dollar pressured prices with spot gold <XAU=> hovering near its lowest in two months at $1,277.00.

Brent crude dipped towards $102 a barrel on Monday as ample supply and a stronger U.S. dollar continued to pressure oil markets.

746,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2014 03:39PM ET</span>","Argentina slams U.S. judge as 'imperialist,' peso halts rout","By Jorge A. Otaola and Richard Lough
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina on Friday accused the U.S. judge who called the country's new debt restructuring plan illegal of making ""imperialist"" comments against the South American nation.
Latin America's No. 3 economy tipped into its second default in 12 years in July after U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa blocked payments to holders of issued under U.S. law that was restructured following its record $100 billion default in 2002.
Griesa ruled that measures proposed by Argentina's president late on Tuesday to make debt payments locally and push bondholders to bring their debt under Argentine law violated past court rulings. But he stopped short of holding the country in contempt.
President Cristina Fernandez's measures, if enacted and executed, would potentially allow Argentina to skirt Griesa's court orders and thus resume interest payments on an estimated $29 billion in restructured bonds.
Argentine Cabinet Chief Jorge Capitanich said Griesa's choice of words was ""unfortunate, incorrect and even, I would say, imperialist expressions"".
Argentina defaulted after Griesa froze a $539 million interest payment, saying restructured bonds cannot be paid unless U.S. investment funds demanding 100 cents on the dollar, plus interest, are simultaneously paid.
Elliott Management Corp, a lead holdout investor suing Argentina via its NML Capital affiliate, is preparing to subpoena a number of international banks in its efforts to seize what it suspects are embezzled Argentine funds, a source at the hedge fund told Thomson Reuters IFR.
Argentine bonds extended losses but the peso halted a two-day rout, firming 0.2 percent on the black market to 13.880 per dollar. It struck a record low of 14.000 on Thursday.
Griesa's move not to level contempt charges against Argentina was aiding the peso erase some of its cumulative 5.2 percent loss on Wednesday and Thursday, market analysts said.
The government has pulled no punches in its stinging criticism of Griesa, accusing the judge of abusing Argentina's national sovereignty.
It said Griesa's remarks showed a ""complete ignorance of the functioning of democratic institutions"".
On Friday, Argentine dollar-denominated Discount bonds due in 2033 traded 2.8 percent lower to bid 78.925 cents on the dollar.
Fernandez's stance makes a resolution to the debt saga increasingly unlikely before the October 2015 presidential election, in which she is constitutionally barred from running.
""What may change that dynamic is a significant deterioration in the macro environment coupled with a meaningful further devaluation of the peso,"" said Nasser Ahmad, chief investment officer of New York-based hedge fund DA Capital.
""That may force the current government back to the negotiating table,"" he added.
The peso's mid-week slump reinforced expectations that a drawn-out crisis will fuel one of the world's highest inflation rates, sap shrinking foreign reserves and deepen the country's recession.

""If capital continues to pour out of the economy, the authorities will probably have to devalue,"" wrote David Rees, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.

In U.S. trading on Friday, EUR/USD was down 0.21% at 1.3252.
Speaking at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's annual Jackson Hole symposium, Janet Yellen said the U.S. economy is recovering and added the labor market is improving as well.
""More jobs have now been created in the recovery than were lost in the downturn, with payroll employment in May of this year finally exceeding the previous peak in January 2008. Job gains in 2014 have averaged 230,000 a month, up from the 190,000 a month pace during the preceding two years,"" Yellen said in prepared remarks of her speech.
""The unemployment rate, at 6.2 percent in July, has declined nearly 4 percentage points from its late 2009 peak. Over the past year, the unemployment rate has fallen considerably, and at a surprisingly rapid pace.""
Yellen's comments sparked a rally earlier for the dollar, though profit taking kicked in after markets concluded that the Fed will still take its time raising interest rates to avoid disrupting recovery.
""Underutilization of labor resources still remains significant,"" Yellen said.
""Given this assessment and the Committee's expectation that inflation will gradually move up toward its longer-run objective, the Committee reaffirmed its view 'that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after our current asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.'""
Geopolitical concerns also sparked profit taking and sent investors to gold.
Ukraine declared on Friday that Russia had launched a ""direct invasion"" of its territory after Moscow sent a convoy of aid trucks across the border into eastern Ukraine where pro-Russian rebels are fighting government forces.
The dollar was up against the yen, with USD/JPY up 0.07% at 103.92, and up against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF up 0.23% at 0.9135.

Bitcoin (BTC/USD) jumped 2.28%, or $11.40, on Bulgaria-based BTC-e to trade at $511.40 during U.S. morning hours. Prices hit a session high of $530.00 earlier, the most since August 14.
Elsewhere, the price of a Bitcoin on Slovenia-based BitStamp inched up 0.33%, or $1.71, to trade at $515.99. According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which averages prices from the major exchanges, prices of the crypto-currency tacked on 0.8% to trade at $516.02.
Meanwhile, euro-denominated Bitcoin prices (BTC/EUR) shed 0.58%, or €2.29, to trade at €393.71 on U.S.-based Kraken Exchange.
Bitcoin prices tumbled sharply on Monday, before moving higher for the past three sessions as investors returned to the market to seek cheap valuations.
Prices on BTC-e plummeted to $309.00 on Monday, in what is being referred to as a ""flash crash"", before recovering to end the day at $440.04.
Market participants speculated that Monday's losses came as a result of excessive margin trading, which caused a flash crash on the BTC-e platform and at least on one additional exchange.
The steep decline then had a cascading effect across the larger Bitcoin market, which dragged prices sharply lower.
A number of traders and market analysts also attributed the plunge to price manipulation by short-term profiteers who are deliberately driving prices down to eventually buy them back at lows.
Bitcoin is digital cash and is not backed by a government or central bank to regulate or issue it. It can be used to purchase goods and services from stores and online retailers.

The pair was likely to find support at around the 1.3250 level and resistance at about 1.3325.

Bitcoin (BTC/USD) eased down 0.06%, or 28 cents, on Slovenia-based BitStamp to trade at $484.00 during U.S. morning hours.
Elsewhere, the price of a Bitcoin on Bulgaria-based BTC-e dipped 0.11%, or 52 cents, to trade at $474.00.
According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which averages prices from the major exchanges, prices of the crypto-currency declined 1.66% to trade at $478.67.
Meanwhile, euro-denominated Bitcoin prices (BTC/EUR) slumped 1.42%, or €5.29, to trade at €366.52 on U.S.-based Kraken Exchange.
Bitcoin prices tumbled sharply on Monday, before rallying on Tuesday as investors returned to the market to seek cheap valuations.
Prices on BTC-e plummeted to $309.00 on Monday, in what is being referred to as a ""flash crash"", before recovering to end the day at $440.04.
Market participants speculated that Monday's losses came as a result of excessive margin trading, which caused a flash crash on the BTC-e platform and at least on one additional exchange.
The steep decline then had a cascading effect across the larger Bitcoin market, which dragged prices sharply lower.
A number of traders and market analysts also attributed the plunge to price manipulation by short-term profiteers who are deliberately driving prices down to eventually buy them back at lows.
Prices of the virtual currency have lost more than $100, or 17%, since the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a lengthy set of risks that virtual currencies pose to consumers on August 11.
Bitcoin is digital cash and is not backed by a government or central bank to regulate or issue it. It can be used to purchase goods and services from stores and online retailers.

798,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 19, 2014 09:30AM ET</span>",Bitcoin Value Jumps More Than A Little Bit,"By Meagan Clark - The price of Bitcoin surged more than 8 percent Tuesday after plunging nearly 12 percent the day before, leaving analysts wondering if the virtual currency has ended its recent long-term decline or if more volatility is ahead.
Bitcoin dropped on Monday to $435.60 from $492.95, before springing back to $470.99 Tuesday morning, according to the virtual currency website CoinDesk.
Bitcoin’s price is known to surge and fall quickly, but lately the currency seems to have slumped.
Last week, Bitcoin fell to its lowest level since May. The price floated around $600 in June and hadn’t fallen below $500 since May, according to CoinDesk. Last year, Bitcoin peaked at about $1,150.
The price briefly hit $309 Monday on an exchange called BTC-e but quickly recovered, a collapse and rebound some in the industry are calling a “flash crash.”
The steadily falling price this month follows a period of relative stability since February and comes as government agencies seek to regulate the currency.

In July, New York became the first state to propose regulations of virtual currency companies. The proposed regulations would require licenses for companies that secure, store or maintain custody of the virtual currency for customers. And last week, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau warned that virtual currencies like Bitcoin are like the “Wild West,” not backed by any government or central bank.
Although Bitcoin has gained popularity among investors and entrepreneurs since its introduction in 2009, consumers have been more hesitant to adopt the currency, likely due to its unpredictable price."

Bitcoin (BTC/USD) jumped 7.16%, or $32.51, on Slovenia-based BitStamp to trade at $486.35 during U.S. morning hours.

Meanwhile, euro-denominated Bitcoin prices Bitcoin (BTC/EUR) rose 4.38%, or €15.47, to trade at €369.00 on U.S.-based Kraken Exchange.
Market participants speculated that Monday's losses came as a result of excessive margin trading, which caused a flash crash on the BTC-e platform and at least on one additional exchange.
The steep decline then had a cascading effect across the larger Bitcoin market, which dragged prices sharply lower.
A number of traders and market analysts also attributed the plunge to price manipulation by short-term profiteers who are deliberately driving prices down to eventually buy them back at lows.
Prices of the virtual currency have lost more than $100, or 17%, since the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a lengthy set of risks that virtual currencies pose to consumers on August 11.
Bitcoin is digital cash and is not backed by a government or central bank to regulate or issue it. It can be used to purchase goods and services from stores and online retailers.

Earlier Friday, data revealed that French industrial production rose 1.3% in June, exceeding expectations for a 1.0% gain, after a decline of 1.6% in May, whose figure was revised from a previously estimated 2.3% drop, which gave the euro an edge over the dollar.
Elsewhere, Germany's trade surplus narrowed to €16.2 billion in June from €18.8 billion in May.

The Iraqi government requested assistance, and gold fell on perceptions that U.S. airstrikes could stabilize the country even if temporarily.
Investors flocked to stocks on sentiments that a Russian decision to back off Ukraine coupled with hopes U.S. airstrikes will halt Iraq's insurgency will allow the global economy to continue with military conflicts disrupting commerce, thus giving investors room to sidestep the dollar on Friday for more risk-on asset classes.

950,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 06, 2014 12:45PM ET</span>",UK Aims For Central Role In Bitcoin Trading ,"By Greg Morcroft - The British Treasury will review ways the City of London can steal a step on rivals trying to master the rise of virtual currencies and become the central trading hub for leading contender bitcoin, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced Wednesday.
According to the Guardian, the report, to be released this fall, will lay out the benefits and risks alike associated with bitcoin and other digital currencies. 
The paper quoted Osborne, the U.K.'s finance chief, as saying, “It’s only by harnessing innovations in finance, alongside our existing world-class knowledge and skills in financial services, that we’ll ensure Britain’s financial sector continues to meet the diverse needs of businesses and consumers, here and around the globe, and create the jobs and growth we all want to see in the future. ... Key to the government’s long- term economic plan is cementing Britain’s position as the center of global finance.""
Bitcoins, created in 2009, gained widespread popularity and their price topped $1,000 in 2012, and they became a legitimate means of exchange in the U.S. But since the collapse of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, one of the largest bitcoin exchanges in the world, in February 2014, regulators have started looking more closely at virtual currencies.
Last month Google NASDAQ:GOOGL began publishing the bitcoin exchange rate just as it does for other currencies like the dollar and the euro.

The Mountain View, California, search giant rolled out support for the virtual currency nearly a month after Google Finance integrated data from Coinbase, a bitcoin wallet and exchange platform.
Google’s move to integrate bitcoin conversions into its search engine follows the February addition, by Microsoft Corp. NASDAQ:MSFT, of bitcoin currency conversions to Bing and the integration of bitcoin prices into Yahoo Finance by Yahoo Inc. NASDAQ:YHOO.
The move in the U.K., home to one of the world's top financial centers in London, follows a move in New York state to license bitcoin trading, according to the Guardian. New York City is currently the world's leading financial center.
Not all international banking groups are keen on bitcoin, though. In July the European Banking Authority advised all European banks against “buying, holding, or selling virtual currencies,” until an adequate regulatory regime is in place to prevent their misuse.
“While there are some potential benefits from virtual currencies, such as faster and cheaper transactions, as well as financial inclusion, the risks outweigh the benefits,” the EBA, which is the European Union’s banking regulatory body, said in a statement released at the time. The regulator identified more than 70 risks associated with the use of virtual currencies, including their threat to the financial integrity of a user and their use in money-laundering and other financial crimes.

980,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 04, 2014 11:51AM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD slips on delayed applause to U.S. jobs report,"Investing.com - The dollar edged higher against the euro on Monday after investors spent the weekend digesting Friday's July jobs report and concluded the numbers point to an improving labor market even though the data missed expectations.
In U.S. trading, EUR/USD was down 0.07% at 1.3419, up from a session low of 1.3416 and off a high of 1.3433.
The pair was likely to find support at 1.3367, last Wednesday's low, and resistance at 1.3445, Friday's high.
The Labor Department reported Friday that the U.S. economy added 209,000 jobs in July, missing expectations for an increase of 233,000, though July marked the sixth consecutive month that the U.S. economy created over 200,000 new payrolls.
The report also showed that the U.S. unemployment rate ticked up to 6.2% last month from 6.1% in June. Analysts had expected the rate to remain unchanged in July, though the number indicated that more unemployed Americans were entering the labor force in search of work, a positive sign.
The unemployment rate does not include discouraged unemployed people who have given up actively searching for work, so a decision by many to look for jobs can send the headline rate higher.
The dollar softened initially the report, though it regained strength by Monday trading after investors concluded that the economy continues to recover and bolster the labor market along with it.
Still, investors also spent the day reexamining how much time will pass from when the Federal Reserve will wind down its bond-buying stimulus program and when it will begin hiking benchmark interest rates, which watered down the greenback's gains.
While the economy is improving, the Fed noted in its July statement on interest rates this week that slackness in the labor market still concerns monetary authorities.
Meanwhile across the Atlantic, the single currency softened on Monday as investors looked ahead to the conclusion of the ECB’s monthly monetary policy review later in the week.
Data late last week showed that the annual rate of inflation in the euro area slowed to 0.4% in July from 0.5% in June, adding to pressure on the bank to implement further easing measures to avert the risk of deflation in the region.
Elsewhere, the euro was down against the pound, with EUR/GBP down 0.20% at 0.7968, and down against the yen, with EUR/JPY down 0.19% at 137.51.
On Tuesday, the euro area is to release data on service-sector activity as well as retail sales.

GBP/USD was down 0.38% to 1.6822 late Friday, and the pair ended the week with losses of 0.94%.

Although it was the sixth successive month that the U.S. economy added more than 200,000 jobs, the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 6.2% from 6.1% in June. In addition, wage growth was flat, pointing to underlying slack in the economy.
The data prompted investors to trim back expectations on the timing of a possible rate hike by the Federal Reserve.

In U.S. trading on Tuesday, GBP/USD was trading down 0.28% at 1.6937 up from a session low of 1.6934 and off a high of 1.6995.
Cable was likely to find support at 1.6739, the low from June 11, and resistance at 1.7001, Monday's high.
The dollar firmed after the Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index rose to 90.9 in July from an upwardly revised 86.4 in June. It was the highest reading since October 2007, defying consensus forecasts for a decline to 85.3.
The data sent investors betting that the Federal Reserve on Wednesday will make fresh cuts to its monthly bond-buying program and deliver and upbeat take on the U.S. economy, possibly alluding to a need to hike interest rates some time in 2015.
Investors were also keeping an eye on the release of July's nonfarm payrolls report due for release on Friday.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said that interest rates could rise sooner if the recovery in the labor market continued.
While markets expect the Fed to wrap up its bond-buying program this year—likely some time in or around October—uncertainty still persists as to how much time will pass after stimulus programs conclude and rate hikes begin, with both positive and negative data driving investor guesses on Fed timetables.
Elsewhere in the U.S., investors took in stride the S&P/Case Shiller Home Price Index.
The 20-city composite index for May grew 9.3% year-over-year, down from April's 10.8% reading, though the 10-city index grew 9.4%, down from April's 10.9%, though markets have priced in slackness in the U.S. housing sector.
Meanwhile in the U.K., official data showed that net lending to individuals rose by £2.5 billion last month, missing expectations for an increase of £2.6 billion. Net lending to individuals in May was revised up to a £3.0 billion increase from a previously estimated £2.7 billion gain.
Elsewhere, sterling was down against the euro, with EUR/GBP up 0.04% at 0.7915, and flat against the yen, with GBP/JPY unchanged at 173.00.
On Wednesday, the pair will move on the Fed's statement on interest rates and monetary policy as well as revised second-quarter U.S. GDP growth data and the ADP report on private sector job creation.

1063,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2014 01:10PM ET</span>",Bitcoin catches on in tech-savvy Romania,"By Luiza Ilie BUCHAREST (Reuters) - In a well-lit office with red window frames in downtown Bucharest, Romania's first bitcoin ATM attracts many who until it opened in May had to buy or sell the digital currency face-to-face or through wire transfers.
The interest in Bitcoin (BTC/USD) in Romania stands out in a region where national currencies are widely seen as poor substitutes for the euro.
Tech-savvy and still deeply distrustful of officialdom 25 years after the end of communism, many Romanians are unfazed by warnings about the cryptocurrency.
In the western town of Oradea, 370 miles (595 km) away from the capital, the first bitcoin exchange in the country has drawn more than 2,000 clients in the seven months since it opened, with transactions totaling 5.12 million lei ($1.57 million).
But Romania ranks as the European Union's second-poorest state and among the weakest in collecting taxes and fighting fraud, making it poorly equipped to manage the bitcoin.
Bitcoin is still an infant in Europe relative to the United States, where hundreds of start-ups backed by some Wall Street traders and venture capitalists have propelled consumer and media interest. Activity in virtual currencies around Europe is concentrated in London, Amsterdam and Berlin.
Romanian entrepreneurs envision a future where the bitcoin is as common as grocery shopping. But they say it needs a legal framework to gain credibility.
""It is an industry in its early stages,"" said George Rotariu, who opened the ATM in Bucharest in collaboration with Vancouver-based Bitcoiniacs and plans to expand to more Romanian cities. ""You need a legislative framework to supply services or have a business in this field,"" he said.
""We groped around in the legislation and interpreted some policies,"" said Horea Vuscan, a local politician who owns the Oradea bitcoin operator BTCXchange.
""We are now in talks with officials because I don't know where we fit in, a bourse, bank, money transfer firm.""
Bitcoin is stored entirely on computers, not backed by any government or central bank. It lets owners hold, trade and move money from place to place almost as cheaply as sending email.
INSTITUTIONAL WEAKNESS
Its use has raised concerns for governments around the world, especially after Tokyo-based Mt Gox, once the world's leading bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy after saying some 850,000 bitcoins had gone missing.
A report by Bank of America last year found bitcoin showed promise as a low-cost way to do e-commerce and as an alternative to traditional money transfer services, but could also be used to evade high taxes, capital controls and confiscation.
In July, the European Banking Authority, the EU's banking watchdog, urged national policymakers to discourage credit and payment institutions from buying, holding, or selling virtual currencies pending a regulatory framework.
""Using bitcoin in Romania is not regulated and carries very large risks,"" said the Romanian Financial Supervision Authority (ASF). ""The risk of fraud is also not to be ruled out.""
It said the industry ""would need to have a visible economic significance in Romania, which it does not"", before regulation is considered, adding it would enforce any EU-approved rules.
Some EU states, including Finland, the United Kingdom, Germany or Poland have found ways to tax bitcoin transactions.
But Romania collects just under 60 percent of its regular tax goal. That amounts to roughly 33 percent of economic output, well below the bloc's 46 percent average.
""There is some preoccupation with bitcoin,"" one finance ministry official said. ""But a legal framework is some time away and only after that will we analyze the need for a fiscal one.""
BITCOIN VOLATILITY
The number of Romanian service providers accepting bitcoins - which are divisible to eight decimal places - has risen slowly to a handful of coffeeshops, gyms, restaurants and beauty salons, according to service tracker coinmap.org.
""I want to bring bitcoin to street level, I want everyone to have a phone app where they keep their coins and use it everywhere, in coffee shops, restaurants, grocery shops, just like a regular wallet,"" BTCXchange owner Vuscan said.
But before it can gain greater traction, bitcoin needs to address its volatility; it has swung from 1,170 lei ($370) to 3,406 lei ($1,100) this year, according to Oradea's BTCXchange.
Vuscan's exchange works only for Romanian leu deals, but he plans to open it to euro and dollar transactions, hoping to join larger European bitcoin exchanges such as Slovenia's Bitstamp.
BTCXchange is registered as a standard company. Vuscan enforced some safeguards - users are required to have a bank account and there are self-imposed policies against money laundering. But there are no legal or regulatory safeguards.
Bitcoin's rise in Romania is partially due to its status as one of Europe's active technology hubs. The country has attracted investors including Oracle, IBM and Intel.
But while Romania boasts pockets of super-fast internet networks, only 58 percent of households have internet access, below the EU average. A 2012 Verizon report also said Romania was the world's second-biggest hacking center after China.
Vuscan says his exchange is safe and he will reimburse clients if their bitcoins get stolen. ""I can hardly wait for them to try,"" he said when asked about hacker attacks.

""However, supply shortages still exist in parts of the country, wages are flat, and tight credit conditions are deterring a higher number of potential buyers from fully taking advantage of lower interest rates.""

1078,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 27, 2014 11:03AM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD weekly outlook: July 28 - August 1,"Investing.com - The euro fell to eight month lows against the stronger dollar on Friday and was close to multi-month lows against the yen and the pound as concerns over the divergence in monetary policy between the European Central Bank and other central banks pressured the single currency lower.
EUR/USD was down 0.25% to 1.3429 at the close, reaching the lowest level since November. For the week, the pair lost 0.74%.
The pair is likely to find support at around 1.3400 and resistance at 1.3475.
The drop in the euro came after a report showed that Germany’s Ifo business climate index dropped to 108.0 in July, missing estimates for a reading of 109.4. It was the third consecutive monthly decline.
The data added concerns over the outlook for the euro zone’s largest economy. The euro has come under pressure since the ECB cut rates to record lows on June 5, in a bid to stave off the risk of deflation and shore up growth in the region.
Sentiment on the single currency was also hit by concerns that tougher sanctions on Russia would have a negative impact on the outlook for growth in the currency bloc, which has close trade ties with Moscow.
The greenback was boosted as better than expected data on durable goods orders for June added to signs that the U.S. economy is improving.
The Commerce Department reported a rise of 0.7% in orders of long lasting goods such as machinery and electronic products, compared to forecasts of 0.5%. Durable goods orders fell by 1.0% in May.

In U.S. trading on Friday, EUR/USD was down 0.23% at 1.3432.
The Census Bureau reported earlier that U.S. durable goods orders rose 0.7% in June, beating expectations for a 0.5% gain, after declining of 1% in May, whose figure was revised from a previously estimated 0.9% contraction.
Core durable goods orders, which are stripped of transportation items, grew 0.8% in June, beating expectations for a 0.6% gain, after a 0.1% downtick in May, whose figure was revised from a previously estimated flat reading.
The data came a day after the U.S. Department of Labor reported that the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending July 19 declined by 19,000 to 284,000, defying market forecasts for claims to rise by 5,000.
The data primed market expectations for the Federal Reserve to wind down its bond-buying stimulus program around October and raise interest rates in 2015.
Geopolitical concerns capped the dollar's advance by stoking fears events in Ukraine and the Middle East will drag on global growth.
The Pentagon said earlier that Russia may be set to provide more sophisticated weapons to Ukrainian separatists, which spooked investors, sending them away from the dollar and stocks and into gold in search of safety.

Elsewhere, the euro was down against the pound, with EUR/GBP down 0.16% at 0.7913, and down against the yen, with EUR/JPY down 0.24% at 136.74.

1114,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 23, 2014 03:30PM ET</span>","Dollar makes cautious gains on data and earnings, Ukraine weighs","Investing.com - The dollar traded largely higher against most major currencies on Wednesday, buoyed by Tuesday's inflation and home sale data as well as upbeat earnings, though geopolitical tensions in Ukraine weighed on the greenback's advance.
In U.S. trading on Wednesday, EUR/USD was down 0.04% at 1.3460.
Upbeat data released in the U.S. on Tuesday and a slew of better-than-expected earnings sent the dollar gaining on Wednesday though spates of profit taking watered down the greenback's advance at times.
The Labor Department reported Tuesday that the U.S. consumer price index rose 2.1% in June, unchanged from the previous month and in line with forecasts.
On a month-over-month basis, U.S. consumer prices were up 0.3% after a 0.4% increase in May, also in line with expectations.
June's core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy costs, rose by just 0.1% from May and 1.9% on year, slightly below market calls for 0.2% and 2.0% readings, respectively, which illustrated how gasoline was driving the headline CPI up, though markets viewed the numbers as fundamentally healthy anyway.
Also on Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors reported earlier that existing U.S. home sales rose 2.6% to 5.04 million units in June from 4.91 million in May, beating market forecasts for a 2.0% rise to 4.97 million units.
Elsewhere, earnings season is underway in the U.S., and better-than-expected numbers from Comcast, Verizon, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Google, Apple, Microsoft, General Electric and others also sent investors flocking to stocks and out of safe-haven gold positions, often a recipe for a firmer dollar.
Separately, reports that two Ukrainian jet fighters were shot down over the rebel-held city of Donetsk only days after pro-Russian separatists allegedly shot down a Malaysian Airlines flight with a missile rattled nerves, which took its toll on the dollar, the euro and other currencies.
Geopolitical concerns sparked fears that the fallout from the Ukraine conflict, which could include fresh sanctions slapped on Russia, will dampen global recovery and prompt the Federal Reserve and other central banks to keep policy loose for longer than once anticipated.
The dollar was up against the yen, with USD/JPY up 0.08% at 101.54, and up slightly against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF up 0.01% at 0.9025.
The greenback was up against the pound, with GBP/USD down 0.21% at 1.7030.
In the U.K., the minutes of the Bank of England’s June meeting released earlier revealed that policymakers voted unanimously to keep monetary policy unchanged last month.
The minutes also said weak wage growth in the face of strong employment growth made it difficult to gauge the degree of slack in the labor market, which allowed the pound to soften against the greenback.
Some members of the monetary policy committee expressed concerns that raising rates too early could destabilize the recovery, given recent signs of weakness in the global economic recovery.
Separately, a report showed that mortgage approvals in the U.K. rose broadly in line with expectations in June.
The British Banker's Association reported that the number of new mortgages approved increased to 43,300 last month from May’s revised total of 41,900, just below forecasts of 43,400.

Statistics Canada reported earlier that retail sales rose 0.7% in May, beating forecasts for a 0.6% gain, while the previous month’s number was revised up to 1.3%.
Core retail sales, which strip out automobile sales, rose 0.1% in May, falling short of expectations for a 0.3% increase and slowing from an upwardly revised 0.8% in April.
The US Dollar Index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.07% at 80.91.

1271,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 09, 2014 11:45AM ET</span>",Bitcoin Exchange Raided By French Authorities,"By Angelo Young - After a four-month investigation, French authorities say they’re the first to shut down a bitcoin exchange in Europe. The move comes as virtual currency advocates are calling for clear and modern regulatory guidelines in Europe and the United States.
Two men are in custody for trading the virtual currency without approval from France’s banking authority. They also face charges of undeclared work, money laundering and pirating computer games, according to a report Monday in the Paris newspaper Liberation.
Prosecutors seized 388 units of the virtual currency, worth about $700 apiece, as well as computer equipment used to operate the exchange.
""This is the first time that an illegal exchange platform for bitcoins like this one has been dismantled in Europe,"" Olivier Caracotch, prosecutor in the southern town of Foix, said in a statement published by AFP.
Last week, police raided locations in the Riviera cities of Cannes and Nice and arrested the men. One was identified as a 27-year-old Tunisian who set up the electronic exchange that traded bitcoins and euros. The other suspect was identified as a 36-year-old French national.
The status of the five-year-old virtual currency lies in regulatory limbo in many countries. France allows the trade in bitcoins, but requires traders to be authorized by the ACPR, the country’s banking authority.
In France, bitcoin-related revenue wired to personal bank accounts without authorization can lead to money laundering charges, according to report last December from the Bank of France. The country charges sales tax on bitcoin transactions, but doesn’t consider it an official currency because vendors aren’t compelled to accept it as legal tender as they would the euro.
Advocates for bitcoin and other forms of virtual currency that are traded outside of any centralized banking authority have been calling for updated laws and more uniform rules.

""One of the challenges is that without clear guidance from the EU, from the UK, it will limit industry development,"" Jeremy Allaire, head of Circle, a consumer finance company that allows people to use and store virtual currencies online, recently told Reuters.
Last month, Expedia Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE), one of the world’s largest online travel agencies, became the latest major company to start accepting bitcoin. Expedia customers can use the virtual currency to pay for hotel bookings.

1276,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 09, 2014 06:30AM ET</span>",China Says It Will Expedite Exchange-Rate Reform,"By Sneha Shankar - China will speed up the process of moving the yuan toward a market-determined exchange rate, Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang told a U.S. delegation Wednesday, while stressing the need to move ahead with care.
Wang’s statement came during the Strategic Economic Dialogue between China and the U.S. in Beijing, which began Tuesday. While the U.S. has been asking China to move its currency toward a market-based exchange rate, China is worried about how Beijing will manage the transition. The yuan has depreciated 2.4 percent against the U.S. dollar so far this year after the People’s Bank of China purchased dollars, Bloomberg reported, adding that the yuan has appreciated about 33 percent against the dollar since 2005.
“China should quicken the pace of reforms and opening up and quicken the exchange rate system reform, but we should pay attention to the details,” Wang said, according to Reuters, adding: “If reforms go too fast, we could be bogged down in details and make fatal mistakes in China's reforms and opening up. If it's too slow, China's reform process could be affected and the United States ... will put pressures (on China).”

U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told CCTV America, the U.S.-based arm of China Central Television, according to Bloomberg: “China needs a market-determined exchange rate, it’s something the government has committed to in its own policy statements and it is an important part of our conversations,” adding: ""The first step would be transparency -- if it was clear when the government was intervening and why -- that would help quite a lot.”
Senior leaders from both countries, including President Xi Jinping, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Lew, are expected to also discuss a bilateral investment treaty at the two-day summit.
“We both depend on an open global trading system in which workers and companies can compete on a level playing field,” Lew said, according to Associated Press.

1284,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2014 06:04PM ET</span>",China's yuan global ambition faces payments hurdle,"By Koh Gui Qing and Saikat Chatterjee
BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's quest to turn its yuan into a full-fledged global currency has hit a road-block as the planned roll-out of a worldwide payments superhighway looks certain to get delayed because of policy snags and technology challenges.
The China International Payments System (CIPS) that would replace a patchwork of networks and allow hassle-free yuan payments was meant to debut later this year, but bankers say it is unlikely to be ready before 2016.
The slippage might be good news for China's big clearing banks such as Bank of China (SS:601988) (HK:3988) and offshore centers such as London or Singapore, which now handle most international yuan transactions and stand to lose their privileged position.
In the long run, however, an efficient global network for yuan trades will be essential for fulfilling Beijing's wish to boost the currency's use. A spate of agreements on yuan clearing with financial centers in Europe and Asia signed over the past month or so highlighted the importance of such a system for those ambitions.
Yet government debate over how much users should be allowed to move in a single day without punching too big of a hole in China's capital controls and technological problems have stymied the system's development, bankers say.
""The central bank is telling others that the first batch of CIPS will be used this year, but we think it is unlikely,"" said a banker at a large Chinese bank. ""The earliest will be 2016.""
Bankers also worry that the roll-out won't be glitch free, and a poorly-designed system with a high transaction failure rate could put off investors.
The Chinese central bank, which leads the effort and was contacted for this article, said the building of the CIPS network was making steady progress as planned. It added that it attached ""great importance"" to the system, whose creation was first announced in 2012.
Eager to have a currency that matches the clout of its rising economy, China has made great strides in promoting the yuan's global use.
It is now the world's seventh most-used currency in goods and services payments, having climbed from 20th rank in 2013, according to data from international financial communications platform SWIFT.
But to attain the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency, China needs to back its yuan with a quality payment system. The dollar is supported by two -- the privately-owned CHIPS system, with an average daily transaction volume of $1.5 trillion and the Federal Reserve's Fedwire handling around $3.5 trillion.
GROWING PAINS
China's record with building its own payment system is less than stellar.
Some banks said they were given only six to eight weeks instead of the customary six months to prepare for an upgrade in the central-bank run China National Advanced Payment System, or CNAPS, causing anguish among its users.
Counter-intuitive coding for processing transactions, ambiguous regulation, heavy demands for information disclosure and the bureaucracy's poor record in software development are not a good omen for the CIPS, some bankers say.
""It is a big enough project and they underestimated the complexity of it,"" said the head of transaction services at a European bank in Hong Kong who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject.
Troubles caused by failed transactions have made some companies consider reverting to the dollar in trade deals, foreign bankers and corporate treasurers at multinational companies say.
One foreign finance executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, estimated that a yuan clearing transaction is two-and-a-half times more likely to fail than a dollar deal.
OBSOLETE?
Yet teething problems aside, few bankers doubt the new international network will eventually become a major long-term alternative to clearing banks and offshore centers.
Having used granting foreign cities rights to host Chinese clearing banks as a part of its diplomacy, Beijing is playing down such a scenario in public.
Last week, for instance, China and South Korea leaders agreed in Seoul on steps to create a yuan clearing system as part of efforts to strengthen commercial and diplomatic ties.
Chinese bankers say the central bank is trying to assure them that the planned global network will not dent their renminbi business. In private, however, regulators are blunt.
""There will be no need for clearing banks in the future,"" said an official with a Chinese regulator who declined to be named as he is not authorized to speak to the media. When asked if offshore yuan clearing centers would also become obsolete once CIPS goes live, he said the new system will provide ""alternative channels"" for yuan payments.
Robert Minikin, head of Asia foreign exchange strategy at the Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong, says granting clearing rights for offshore centers is not so much a commitment from Beijing to preserve their privileged position, but rather a signal of its global ambitions for the yuan.
""It (the global payment system) helps create more of an even playing field for the financial centers outside mainland China.""
In the meantime, any loss in clearing fees for banks and offshore centers due to competition from CIPS won't be paltry.
Daily yuan trading volumes have gone up 3-1/2 times since 2010 to $120 billion, the ninth highest, according to a Bank for International Settlements report published last September.
Luxembourg, which signed a deal with China last month that precedes the designation of a yuan clearing bank in the financial hub, is watching the payment network's progress closely.
Its finance minister Pierre Gramegna, who was in Beijing last week to mark the agreement, said he would discuss the network with Chinese authorities and ""listen carefully"" to what they say about the timing of its launch.

But he is optimistic that not all is lost for CIPS rivals.
""In the end, it's the market that decides,"" Gramegna said when asked whether clearing banks and centers will soon be irrelevant. ""It's the solution that is the most efficient that players would choose.""

Many investors jumped to the sidelines to await the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's June policy meeting, which may hold clues concerning the direction of monetary policy.
Goldman Sachs said it expected the Fed to raise interest rates in the third quarter of 2015 as opposed to the first quarter of 2016 made in an earlier prediction, though uncertainty ahead of the release of the Fed minutes swayed investors away from the dollar.
The euro, meanwhile, rose on demand from bargain hunters despite soft German industrial output numbers.
Official data showed that German industrial output fell 1.8% in May, the third consecutive monthly decline, defying market calls for a 0.2% expansion.
Elsewhere, the euro was up against the pound, with EUR/GBP up 0.27% at 0.7943, and down against the yen, with EUR/JPY down 0.14% at 138.57.
On Tuesday in the euro zone, Germany is to publish data on its trade balance.

1309,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2014 04:44AM ET</span>",Dollar creeps higher as equities prepare for earnings,"By Marc Jones 
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar was on its strongest run since late October on Monday as the momentum of last week's stellar U.S. jobs data carried markets towards what will be a crucial earnings season for record high shares. 
Weak manufacturing data from Germany took the wind out of European shares and the euro in early trading, but for the most part moves were minor and there was little reaction from the region's bond markets. 
The dollar, meanwhile, was up for its fifth straight day against a basket of other major currencies - its longest streak of gains since October - supported by the steady climb in U.S. bond yields since last week's robust U.S. jobs report. 
""Overall the dollar is a bit stronger and that will remain in place over the next week,"" said Vasileios Gkionakis Global Head of FX Strategy for UniCredit in London. 
""Rates in the U.S. are going to grind higher, dollar/yen is going to grind higher and probably in the next week or two against the euro as well."" 
German industrial output fell 1.8 percent on the month in May, its biggest drop in more than 2 years, confounding expectations of unchanged industrial output in Europe's powerhouse. 
The DAX in Frankfurt fell 0.3 percent, a top faller in Europe along with the French CAC, which was down 0.4 percent after pharmaceuticals heavyweight Sanofi warned currency effects would dent its earnings. 
""It's just more evidence that overall economic growth has slowed down in the second quarter from the strong first quarter,"" Ioan Smith, director at KCG, said. 
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 was down 0.1 percent to 1,392.31, having gained 1.7 percent last week, its biggest weekly rise since March. 
EARNINGS 
Global shares rallied broadly last week, pushing MSCI's All World share index to a record high, as U.S. employment growth smashed forecasts and unemployment fell to near a six-year low of 6.1 percent. 
Investors are now looking at whether record share prices will be justified by quarterly earnings reports and forecasts in the United States and elsewhere, with aluminum producer Alcoa kicking off the U.S. earnings season on Tuesday. 
Analysts polled by Reuters expect earnings growth of 6.2 percent for the second quarter, and a return to double-digits in the third and fourth quarters of 10.9 percent and 11.9 percent, respectively. 
""People said the U.S. earnings would be bad for January-March but in the end the profits were up. I would expect decent results (this time),"" said Tsuyoshi Shimizu, chief strategist at Mizuho Asset Management. 
Despite the improvement in the job market, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep interest rates near zero for at least a year even as it trims its bond-buying stimulus. 
In addition, two other major central banks - the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan - are committed to stimulus, keeping cheap money sloshing around possibly for years. 
Still, U.S. bond yields jumped after the jobs data, with the rate-sensitive two-year yield staying near a 10-month high. 
The two-year U.S. yield stood at 0.528 percent on Monday, having risen to 0.532 percent on Thursday, when the jobs report came out. 
DOLLAR DEMAND 
The dollar index rose to 80.300, the highest level in a week and a half, having recovered from a two-month low of 79.740 on Tuesday. 
As a result, the euro was on the back foot at $1.3586 down from last week's six-week high of $1.3701. The yen traded at 102.11 yen to the dollar, also off a six-week high of 101.235 set a week ago. 
In emerging markets, the Indonesian rupiah jumped 1.5 percent to hit a five-week high of 11,680 rupiah to the dollar as local share prices rose ahead of the presidential election on Wednesday. 
Former special forces chief Prabowo Subianto and Jakarta Governor Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo are running neck-and-neck in opinion polls but markets were buoyed by Jokowi's good chances as he is seen as more market-friendly. 

Among commodities, U.S. crude oil futures traded little changed at $103.97 per barrel, near Friday's low of $103.67, as Libya geared up to resume exports after the end of a rebel group's almost year-long blockage of two major ports. 
With safe-haven assets out of favor, spot gold slipped 0.6 percent to $1,312.40 an ounce, after five consecutive weekly gains. Silver fell 1 percent.

1327,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 04, 2014 09:52AM ET</span>",Virtual Currency 'Risks Outweigh Benefits:' EBA ,"By Avaneesh Pandey - The European Banking Authority, or EBA, has advised all European banks against “buying, holding, or selling virtual currencies,” until an adequate regulatory regime is in place to prevent the misuse of such currency.
“While there are some potential benefits from virtual currencies, such as faster and cheaper transactions, as well as financial inclusion, the risks outweigh the benefits,” EBA, which is the European Union’s banking regulatory body, said in a statement released Friday.
The assessment of virtual currencies was carried out jointly by the EBA, the European Central Bank and the European Securities and Markets Authority.           
EBA expressed apprehensions over the use of virtual currencies like bitcoin and said that inherent flaws in virtual currencies leave them open to anonymous exploitation. “A virtual currency scheme can be created- and its function subsequently changed- by anyone with sufficient share of computational power,” it stated, referring to the decentralized mining process used to create bitcoins.
Bitcoins (BTC/USD), created in 2009, gained widespread popularity and their price topped $1,000 in 2012, and they became a legitimate means of exchange in the U.S. However, since the collapse of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, one of the largest bitcoin exchanges in the world, in February 2014, regulators have started looking more closely at virtual currencies.
EBA further stressed the need to create “scheme governing authorities,” which would be accountable for the integrity of each virtual currency so that incidents such as Mt. Gox can be avoided.
The regulator identified more than 70 risks associated with the use of virtual currencies, including their threat to the financial integrity of a user and their use in money laundering and other financial crimes.

EBA stated that a “two pronged approach” combining regulation and shunning the use of virtual currencies until safeguards are put in place, is required to address the threats posed by an unregulated and decentralized virtual currency.
 Adding that the “immediate response” of stopping the use of virtual currency would only shield regulated financial services from interactions with virtual currencies and would not address the “risks within the virtual currency schemes,” EBA said that “a regulatory approach to address these risks would require a substantial body of regulation.”

1379,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 30, 2014 02:45PM ET</span>",Legal Bitcoin: Why It Could Be A Problem,"By Kathleen Caulderwood - California lawmakers approved the legalization of Bitcoin (BTC-eUSD) transactions in the state on Monday. But while it will help businesses keep up with the times, critics fear alternative currencies bring new risks with them.  
“While these innovations are taking us far in terms of technological advancement, they also expose individual customers and businesses to a wide array of risks, which largely stem from just how easy these innovations are to use,” said Shellye Archambeau, Chief Executive of Palo alto-based software company, in a statement.
“As these payment systems continue to converge and consolidate, and as we bring more functionalities onto our mobile devices, the higher the risk of our devices and data being compromised,” she added.
On Saturday,  California governor Jerry Brown signed legislation that cleared obstacles to the use of bitcoin and other alternative currencies, repealing an “outdated” state law that prohibits use of “anything but the lawful money of the United States.” Lawmakers approved the measure on Monday.

Assemblyman Roger Dickinson, Democrat from Sacramento, said the law was appropriate given the current technology landscape.
“In an era of evolving payment methods, from Amazon Coins to Starbucks Stars, it is impractical to ignore the growing use of cash alternatives,” he said in a statement, according to the L.A. Times.
The decision comes just days after Mt. Gox, one of the world’s largest bitcoin exchanges, was approved to begin bankruptcy proceedings after it lost 850,000 bitcoins to hackers earlier this year, worth roughly $500 million.
On Friday, U.S. authorities auctioned off 30,000 bitcoins they seized when they shut down Silk Road, an online black market for illegal services that primarily accepted bitcoin.

1396,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 29, 2014 10:43AM ET</span>",Forex - GBP/USD weekly outlook: June 30 - July 4,"Investing.com - The pound remained supported above the 1.70 level against the dollar on Friday, trading within striking distance of six-year highs amid heightened expectations for a U.K. rate hike before the end of the year.
GBP/USD ended Friday’s session at 1.7036, up slightly from 1.7024 late Thursday. The pair touched a high of 1.7062 on June 19, the strongest level since October 2008.
Cable was likely to find support at 1.6969, Thursday’s low and resistance at 1.7062.
Data on Friday confirmed that the U.K. economy expanded by 0.8% in the first three months of 2014. The economy grew at an annual rate of 3.0% in the first quarter, the fastest since 2007.
Earlier Friday, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney indicated that rates were unlikely to return to their pre-crisis levels of 5%, but instead could be expected to rise to around 2.5% by the first quarter of 2017.
The BoE announced a new affordability test on banks and a cap on home loans on Thursday, in a bid to prevent the housing market from destabilizing the U.K. economy.
Demand for sterling continued to be underpinned as the new measures did little to alter expectations that the BoE will raise interest rates ahead of other central banks.
The dollar remained broadly weaker after a report on Friday showing that consumer sentiment was revised higher this month did little to reassure investors about the outlook for the wider recovery.
The final reading of the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index rose to 82.5 this month from 81.9 in May, compared to expectations of 82.2.
The greenback remained under pressure after the Commerce Department reported Wednesday that the U.S. economy contracted at an annual rate of 2.9% in the first three months of the year, compared to the consensus forecast for a decline of 1.7%.
Another report on Thursday showed that U.S. consumer spending rose by just 0.2% in May, below forecasts for 0.4%.

1403,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 27, 2014 07:00PM ET</span>",How Do You Solve A Problem Like Bitcoin?,"By Kathleen Caulderwood - Last October, federal agents shut down Silk Road and seized its assets -- about $4 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC-eUSD), and a few months later hackers stole hundreds of thousands from the world’s biggest marketplace, many of which will likely never be recovered.
The price of the virtual currency has been in constant flux since it came to life in 2009, ranging from just a few pennies to more than a thousand dollars. High-profile heists and government shutdowns haven’t helped.
But bidders are lining up to participate in a government auction today, to get a piece of a possibly shrinking global supply.

Of the 850,000 bitcoins stolen back in February from Mt. Gox, Mark Karpelès, head of the now defunct exchange has only been able to recover about 200,000.
“As the company head, my mission was to protect customers and employees,”, said to The Wall Street Journal, from his apartment in Tokyo.  “I’m deeply sorry. I’m frustrated with myself.”
Earlier this month, officials approved Mt. Gox’s application for bankruptcy protection of its U.S. assets, and Karpelès said he plans to auction off domain names like bitcoins.com to help pay off the debt and keep business running, but does’nt think any more missing coins will turn up.
But that’s not turning off firms who plan to participate in a 12-hour government auction Friday, in which U.S. authorities will try and sell nearly 30,000 bitcoins recovered during the Silk Road shutdown.
Potential bidders include investment firm SecondMarket, Bitcoin Investment Trust, Binary Financial and Pantera Capital, according to a list leaked earlier this month.  
“It’s just one of those big plays that you have to be involved with if you’re a big player,” Binary Financial managing partner Harry Yeh said to Coindesk, adding that they may end up selling for up to 20 percent below market value.
Analysts disagree about what the action will do to prices.
“Selling bitcoin with its somewhat liquid market is not the same as auctioning off a 1998 Chevy with a couple of bullet holes in the driver’s door,” said Citigroup research analyst Steven Englander in a Wednesday note.
All bidders had to be vetted by authorities, prove their identities and that they had $200,000 in cash and not affiliated with Silk Road, according to The New York Times.
“The U.S. marshal specifically has never had to auction off this type of asset,” Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria said to the Times. “They’re figuring it out for the first time, and maybe that’s why the process hasn’t been completely transparent.
It’s the first time bitcoins have even been auctioned in this way, which is why only a fifth of the total government supply will be sold today, as a kind of test run. Participants will be able to bid on lots of 3,000.

1405,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 27, 2014 02:43PM ET</span>",Dollar slides as market bets on rates staying low,"Investing.com - The dollar traded largely lower against most major currencies on Friday as markets shrugged off hawkish comments from a Federal Reserve official and bet that benchmark interest rates will stay low well into 2015.
In U.S. trading on Friday, EUR/USD was up 0.25% at 1.3645.
The dollar fell on Friday after markets bet the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low for some time to come.
On Thursday, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard told Fox Business Network that an improving economy may make conditions ripe for interest rates to rise possibly in early 2015.
The dollar rose initially on the news, though investors digested Bullard's comments and took them in stride, as he is a known inflation hawk and is a non-voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which allowed for profit taking on Friday despite positive U.S. data.
The revised Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index rose to 82.5 in June from 81.2 in May, beating expectations for a 82.2 reading.

1416,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 26, 2014 12:25PM ET</span>","Forex - GBP/USD trims gains on Fed language, U.S. data","Investing.com - The pound trader higher against the dollar on Thursday though the pair trimmed gains after a key Federal Reserve official described a sluggish first-quarter as a one-off event and predicted inflation rates to hit comfort zones in a matter of months.
In U.S. trading on Thursday, GBP/USD was trading up 0.20% at 1.7015, up from a session low of 1.6971 and off a high of 1.7040.
Cable was likely to find support at 1.6952, Wednesday's low, and resistance at 1.7063, the high from June 19.
St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard told Fox Business Network earlier that an improving economy may make conditions ripe for interest rates to rise possibly in early 2015.
The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that U.S. gross domestic product contracted at an annual rate of 2.9% in the first quarter of the year, far surpassing consensus forecasts for a decline of 1.7%, though markets quickly brushed off the dismal numbers as a weather-related disappointment.
""I think the market's right to shake this off,"" Bullard told the network, describing the contraction as an ""aberration.""
""If you throw out the first quarter and just look forward over the next four quarters, most forecasters have 3%-plus growth.""
Inflation, while still low, is on the rise and approaching the Fed's 2% target.
""My forecast actually has us moving through 2% and over 2% in 2015,"" which bolstered the dollar despite lackluster U.S. data.
The U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending June 21 declined by 2,000 to 312,000 from the previous week’s revised total of 314,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to fall by 4,000 to 310,000 last week.
A separate report showed that U.S. personal spending rose 0.2% last month, below expectations for an increase of 0.4%. Personal spending for April was revised to a flat reading from a previously reported decline of 0.1%.
Bullard's comments boosted the dollar, with the greenback taking back earlier losses stemming from the weak GDP report.
Meanwhile in the U.K., the Bank of England said that from October it will cap mortgages, so that people borrowing 85% of a house's value will not be allowed to borrow more than 4.5 times their income.
The bank also announced a new affordability test on banks, whereby borrowers will now have to show that they can repay the mortgage even if interest rates rise 3%, up from 1% previously.
BoE Governor Mark Carney said the recovery in the U.K. economy is broadening and strengthening, but the housing market is the main risk to financial stability.
The bank acknowledged that the immediate impact of the cap would be minimal as most lenders already lend within the 4.5 income limit, but Carney said the measures will have ""an impact of the durability of the expansion.""
Demand for sterling continued to be underpinned as the new measures did little to alter expectations that the BoE will raise interest rates ahead of other central banks.
Elsewhere, sterling was up against the euro, with EUR/GBP down 0.31% at 0.8001, and down slightly against the yen, with GBP/JPY down 0.01% at 172.99.
On Friday, the U.K. is to produce data on the current account and final data on first quarter growth.
The U.S. is to round up the week with revised data on consumer sentiment.

The pair was expected to test support at 101.43, the low from May 29, and resistance at 102.17, Tuesday's high.
The Commerce Department reported earlier that U.S. gross domestic product contracted at an annual rate of 2.9% in the first quarter of the year, far surpassing consensus forecasts for a decline of 1.7%.
U.S. first-quarter GDP was initially reported to have increased by 0.1%, but was subsequently revised to show a contraction of 1.0%.
The difference between the second and third estimate was the largest since records began in 1976, the Commerce Department added.
A separate report showed that U.S. durable goods orders fell 1.0% in May, while core durable goods orders fell 0.1%. Market expectations had been for an increase of 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively.
The data weakened the dollar by fueling expectations for the Federal Reserve to keep benchmark interest rates on hold at record lows for longer than thought.
The dollar didn't plummet, however, as rough winter weather likely exacerbated the economy's poor showing, while recent data has suggested that the economy has rebounded sharply from the first three months of the year.
The yen, meanwhile, was down against the euro and up against the pound, with EUR/JPY up 0.03% at 138.76, and GBP/JPY trading down 0.23% at 172.78.
On Thursday, the U.S. is to release data on personal income and expenditure, as well as data on inflation linked to personal spending.

The dollar firmed earlier on the coattails of upbeat U.S. data.
New home sales rose to a six-year high, surging 18.6% in May to an annual rate of 504,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. May's figure was the highest level since May 2008 and the largest monthly increase since January 1992.
Analysts were expecting new home sales to rise 1.6% to 440,000 units.
The dollar also saw demand after the Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index jumped to 85.2 in June from 82.0 last month. It was the highest reading since January 2008.
Analysts were expecting a reading of 83.5.
The numbers kept market expectations firm for the Federal Reserve to continue winding down its monthly bond-buying program this year and begin hiking interest rates in 2015.
Fed stimulus programs such as monthly bond purchases weaken the dollar by suppressing long-term interest rates, which sends investors to assets like stocks in hopes lower borrowing costs will spur investment and hiring.
Meanwhile in Europe, investors took in stride data revealing that the German Ifo business climate index fell to a six-month low of 109.7 this month from 110.4 in May, missing estimates for a 110.3 reading.
The euro shrugged off the data on sentiments geopolitical concerns have businesses worried more than structural issues in the German economy.
""Assessments of the current business situation remained good, but companies were less optimistic about future business developments. The German economy fears the potential impact of the crises in Ukraine and Iraq,"" Ifo President Hans-Werner Sinn said.
Sinn added that although the export outlook for manufacturing had ""clouded over considerably, the majority of manufacturers remain optimistic.""
The manufacturing component of the index fell to 15.7 from 19.0 in May, but the construction, wholesaling and retail components all improved.
Later in the session, geopolitical concerns watered down the dollar's earlier gains, sending investors to safe-haven assets like gold, which tends to trade inversely with the greenback.
Reports that Syrian warplanes hit targets in western Iraq earlier Tuesday in an effort to join Iran and support the embattled Baghdad government sent gold prices climbing due to safe-haven demand, as fears began to grow the conflict will increase in duration and complexity, especially if Washington gets more involved.
Gold often sees safe-harbor demand among investors worried over geopolitical issues.
The dollar was flat against the yen, with USD/JPY unchanged at 101.93, and down against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF down 0.03% at 0.8940.

Thismonth's improvement is consistent with data suggesting that the authorities mini-stimulus are filtering through to the real economy. Over the next few months, infrastructure investments and related sectors will continue to support the recovery. We expect policy makers to continue their current path of accommodative policy stance until the recovery is sustained.""

The data came after the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending June 14 declined by 6,000 to 312,000 from the previous week’s revised total of 318,000. Analysts had expected jobless claims to fall by 4,000 to 314,000 last week.
But the dollar remained under pressure after the Fed gave no indication of when interest rates could start to rise at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday. In addition, the Fed’s forecast of where interest rates might reach in the long term fell from 4% to 3.75%.
The central bank cut its bond purchases by $10 billion a month, to $35 billion, saying there was ""sufficient underlying strength"" in the U.S. economy to continue tapering.
The Fed acknowledged the recent increases in inflation and drop in unemployment, but Chair Janet Yellen said no formula was in place for when interest rates would start to rise.
USD/JPY eased 0.09% to 101.82, off the one-week high of 102.14 reached Wednesday ahead of the Fed announcement.
GBP/USD touched highs of 1.7063, the most since August 2009, and was last at 1.7058. Sterling shrugged off data showing that U.K. retail sales fell in May, declining for the first time since January.
U.K. retail sales decreased by 0.5% last month, in line with forecasts, official data showed, and were 3.9% higher on a year-over-year basis. The data did little to alter expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates sooner than other central banks.
EUR/USD was up 0.29% to 1.3634.
Elsewhere, USD/CHF lost 0.49% to trade at 0.8914. The Swiss National Bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged close to zero on Thursday and reaffirmed its commitment to the minimum exchange rate of CHF1.20 per euro.
The accompanying rate statement released after the announcement said that the Swiss franc is “still high.”
The SNB also said it would continue to enforce the minimum exchange rate of 1.20 per euro imposed in September 2011, and reiterated that it is prepared to purchase foreign currency in “unlimited quantities” if necessary.
AUD/USD eased 0.07% to 0.9413, while NZD/USD was down 0.06% to 0.8728 and USD/CAD slipped 0.11% to 1.0826.

1525,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 17, 2014 12:35PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD dips as dollar gains on U.S. inflation data,"Investing.com - Upbeat U.S. inflation data sent the dollar firming against its European counterpart on Tuesday by fueling expectations that the Federal Reserve will conclude a policy meeting on Wednesday by making fresh cuts to its monthly bond-buying program.
In U.S. trading, EUR/USD was down 0.22% at 1.3543, up from a session low of 1.3513 and off a high of 1.3587.
The pair was likely to find support at 1.3512, Thursday's low, and resistance at 1.3677, the high from June 6.
The Labor Department reported earlier that the U.S. consumer price index rose 2.1% on year in May and rose 0.4% from April. It was the fastest increase in annual inflation since October 2008, which sparked demand for the greenback.
Market expectations had been for an annual increase of 2.0% and a monthly rise of 0.2%.
Firming inflation rates should prompt the Federal Reserve to continue winding down its monthly bond-buying program and later raise benchmark interest rates from current record lows as the economy gains steam.
The Fed will conclude a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, and the U.S. central bank is seen scaling back its asset-purchasing program by another $10 billion, though hikes to benchmark interest rates won't come until sometime in 2015.
A separate report showed that both U.S. housing starts and building permits fell in May, pointing to underlying weakness in the housing sector.

Elsewhere, the euro was down against the pound, with EUR/GBP down 0.11% at 0.7984, and up against the yen, with EUR/JPY up 0.10% at 138.37.

The Reserve Bank of Australia appeared to tilt toward a dovish stance in its latest minutes from the June board meeting released on Tuesday.
The RBA tweaked its language to highlight uncertainties which ""were likely to take some time to resolve."" It is ""difficult to judge the extent to which this (low interest rates) would offset the expected substantial decline in mining investment and the effect of planned fiscal consolidation.""
In China, May actual foreign direct investment fell 6.7%, from a gain of 5.0% year-on-year in April.
AUD/USD traded at 0.9365, down 0.37%, after the data.
Overnight, the dollar traded largely lower against most major currencies due to uncertainty the effects the Iraq insurgency will have on U.S. recovery, while an International Monetary Fund decision to trim its U.S. 2014 growth rate weakened the greenback as well.
In Asia, USD/JPY 102.03, up 0.19%, after the China data.
Concerns over the ongoing Sunni insurgency in Iraq continued to weigh on the dollar Monday by stoking fears that the escalating conflict could dampen global recovery, especially if the violence disrupts Iraqi oil exports, hikes prices at U.S. gasoline pumps and waters down the economy.
Elsewhere, news that the International Monetary Fund trimmed its 2014 U.S. economic growth forecast due to a harsh winter and a “still-struggling housing market” softened the greenback as well.
The IMF said it now expects the U.S. economy to expand 2% in 2014, down from its forecast of 2.8% in April.
Positive U.S. data meanwhile did little to boost the greenback.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported earlier that its general business conditions index increased to 19.28 this month from 19.01 in May. Analysts had expected the index to decline to 15.0.
A separate report showed that U.S. industrial production rose by 0.6% last month, beating forecasts for a 0.5% gain.
Meanwhile across the Atlantic, Eurostat reported earlier that the euro zone's consumer price index rose 0.5% last month, in line with expectations and unchanged from a preliminary estimate. Euro zone inflation rose by 0.7% in April.
Still, the rate remains firmly below the European Central Bank's target of near but just below 2%, which capped the single currency's advance.
The US Dollar Index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose 0.07% at 80.61.
On Tuesday, the U.S. is to produce data on housing starts, building permits and consumer prices, while investors will be eager for Wednesday's statement from the Federal Reserve on interest rates and monetary policy.

BTC/USD rose to a session high of $610.00 on Slovenia-based BitStamp, before coming off the highs to last trade at $605.49 during U.S. morning hours, up 5.41%, or $31.10.
The price of a Bitcoin on Bulgaria-based BTC-e jumped 4.89%, or $27.86, to trade at $597.00, after hitting a daily peak of $603.99.
According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which averages prices from the major exchanges, prices of the crypto-currency advanced 1.59% to trade at $601.40.
Bitcoin sold off last week after reports revealed that mega mining pool GHash briefly contributed over 51% of the currency's hashing for the first time in history.
Market analysts believe that one of the biggest threats to Bitcoin is the increasing centralization of mining due to pools like GHash.
Crossing the 51%-threshold can give those who control the mining operation the ability to spend the same coins twice, reject competing miners' transactions and extort higher fees from people with large holdings.
Appetite for the digital currency remained weak after the U.S. announced plans last week to auction nearly 30,000 bitcoin seized from the infamous online black market Silk Road.
The U.S. Marshals Service said on June 12 that it plans to auction approximately 30,000 Bitcoins, valued at nearly $17.3 million, that were seized as part of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's crackdown on the Silk Road online marketplace last year.
The auction, which is expected to take place on June 27, will be sold in nine blocks of 3,000 Bitcoins and one of 2,657 coins.
Bitcoin prices rallied to $683 on June 2 amid speculation the digital currency will become more mainstream. U.S. satellite service provider DISH Network and online travel website Expedia both stated that they will start accepting Bitcoin later this year.
Bitcoin is digital cash and is not backed by a government or central bank to regulate or issue it. It can be used to purchase goods and services from stores and online retailers.

GBP/USD hit 1.7011, the highest since August 6, 2009 before pulling back to 1.6978, 0.07% higher for the day.
Cable was likely to find support at 1.6950 and resistance at 1.7050.
Sterling continued to build on gains after Mark Carney said last Thursday that rapid economic growth and the steep decline in the jobless rate mean that the time to begin raising interest rates is growing closer.
""There's already great speculation about the exact timing of the first rate hike and this decision is becoming more balanced. It could happen sooner than markets currently expect,"" the BoE governor said.
Official data on Wednesday showed that the U.K. unemployment rate fell to a five-year low of 6.6% in the three months to April.
Carney said the bank will monitor the labor market closely to determine the right moment to start raising rates and reiterated that when rates do start to rise they will do so only gradually.
The comments prompted investors to bring forward expectations for a rate hike by the BoE. Some market watchers already expect the central bank to start raising rates from their record low 0.5% late this year.
The pound’s gains were held in check as concerns over the ongoing Sunni insurgency in Iraq continued to weigh on market sentiment, fuelling fears over the impact of reduced oil supply on global growth.
Elsewhere, the pound rose to fresh one-a-half year highs against the euro on Monday, with EUR/GBP down 0.23% to 0.7963.

The jump may indicate an end to the People's Bank of China's three-month weakening campaign and followed evidence that China's economy is rebounding, the Wall Street Journal reported. The central bank had orchestrated a 3 percent depreciation earlier in the year to boost exports.
China posted a $35.9 billion trade surplus in May, with manufacturing data and consumer inflation also back on track.

""The long-term underlying trend of China hasn't changed at all: The country's current account is still a surplus, its growth rate is still much faster than most other countries,"" Andy Seaman, Stratton Street Capital LLP's fund manager in London, told the Journal. Seaman also said he expects the yuan to appreciate in the long term.

1577,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 12, 2014 11:23PM ET</span>",Forex - Japanese yen weaker after BoJ holds policy steady,"Investing.com - The Japanese yen weakened against the dollar after the Bank of Japan on Friday kept ultra-loose monetary in place at its latest board meeting.
""The Bank of Japan will conduct money market operations so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about ¥60 to ¥70 trillion,"" the BoJ said.
On the current economic climate, the BoJ repeated its overall assessment, saying,""Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately as a trend, although the subsequent decline in demand following the front-loaded increase prior to the consumption tax hike has been observed.""
BoJ and government policymakers have said the drag from the April sales tax hike to 8% from 5% appears to be easing. The latest government surveys have also shown that consumer sentiment rebounded in May.
Japan industrial production and capacity utilization is due at 1330 Tokyo, (0430 GMT) for April. The Industrial Production number came in at minus 2.5% in the preliminary reading, capacity utilization came in at a gain of 0.4% in March.
USD/JPY traded at 101.79, up 0.08%, after the BoJ announcement.
In China comes retail sales and industrial production data for May at 1330 Beijing (0530 GMT). Retail sales rose 11.9% year-on-year in April and are expected to have accelerated to 12.1%. Industrial production, which came in at a gain of 8.7% year-on-year in April, is expected at a rise of 8.8%.
AUD/USD traded at 0.9414, down 0.13%, ahead of the data closely followed by Australia as the top export destination for commodities such as iron ore.
Overnight, lukewarm U.S. retail sales data weakened the dollar against the euroy by reminding investors that recovery still battles headwinds and the timing of Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes still remains up in the air.
The Commerce Department reported earlier that U.S. retail sales rose 0.3% in May, missing expectations for a 0.6% gain. However, retail sales for April were revised up to a 0.5% gain from a previously reported increase of 0.1%.
Core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, eased up 0.1% in May, disappointing forecasts for a 0.2% increase. Core sales in April were revised up to 0.4% from a previously reported flat reading.
Separately, the Labor Department reported that the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending June 7 increased by 4,000 to 317,000, confounding expectations for a decline of 3,000, though markets largely shrugged off the report.
The data kept markets rethinking how much time will elapse after the Federal Reserve concludes stimulus programs and before the U.S. central bank hikes interest rates.
Meanwhile in Europe, data released earlier revealed that euro zone industrial production rose 0.8% in April, according to Eurostat, beating forecasts for a 0.4% increase.
Still, the single currency battled pressures of its own after the ECB cut all its main rates to record lows last Thursday and imposed negative deposit rates on commercial lenders for the first time in an effort to stave off the deflationary risks in the euro zone.

1646,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 08, 2014 06:03AM ET</span>",Forex - USD/JPY weekly outlook: June 9 - 13,"Investing.com - The dollar edged slightly higher against the yen on Friday after data showing that May marked the fourth month of jobs growth in the U.S. indicated that the economic recovery is on track.
The Department of Labor reported that the U.S. economy added 217,000 jobs last month, just under expectations for jobs growth of 218,000, while April's figure was revised to 282,000. 
The U.S. unemployment rate remained unchanged at a five-and-a-half year low of 6.3%.
USD/JPY was at 102.47 late Friday, recovering from session lows of 102.12 struck immediately after the jobs data was released. 
The pair is likely to find support at 102.00 and resistance at 102.78, last Wednesday’s high.
Elsewhere Friday, EUR/JPY was almost unchanged at 139.87 at the close of trade, recovering from the lows of 138.66 struck in the previous session. For the week, the pair was 0.42% higher.
The euro remained supported even after the European Central Bank unveiled a package of measures to avert the threat of persistently low inflation in the euro area on Thursday.
The ECB cut the main refinancing rate in the euro area to a record low 0.15% and imposed negative deposit rates on commercial lenders, in a bid to stimulate lending to businesses. 
The bank also implemented a new Long-Term Refinancing Operation, designed to help banks lend to small companies and said it would ""intensify"" its preparatory work on the 'asset-backed security' market.
The ECB acted after a report showed that the annual rate of inflation in the euro zone slowed to 0.5% in May, far below the ECB’s target of close to but just under 2%.
In the week ahead, investors will be looking ahead to Thursday’s U.S. retail sales report for further indications on the strength of the recovery. Revised data on Japanese first quarter growth and the outcome of a monetary policy meeting by the Bank of Japan will also be closely watched.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.

The Department of Labor reported that the U.S. economy added 217,000 jobs last month, just under expectations for jobs growth of 218,000, while April's figure was revised to 282,000. The unemployment rate remained steady at a five-and-a-half year low of 6.3%.
EUR/USD initially touched a two-week high of 1.3677 following the release of the data, before pulling back to 1.3642 late Friday. For the week, the pair was 0.34% higher.
The U.S. jobs report came one day after the European Central Bank unveiled a package of measures to avert the threat of persistently low inflation in the euro area, briefly sending the single currency to four month lows of 1.3502 against the dollar, before later erasing the day’s losses.
The ECB cut the main refinancing rate in the euro area to a record low 0.15% and imposed negative deposit rates on commercial lenders, in a bid to stimulate lending to businesses.

Elsewhere Friday, the Canadian dollar ended slightly lower against the U.S. dollar following the release of a lackluster domestic jobs report.
Statistics Canada reported that the economy added 25,800 jobs in May, above expectations for 25,000, but gains were due to the creation of part time positions, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 7.0% from 6.9% in April.
USD/CAD touched highs of 1.0948 before settling at 1.0931 late Friday.
In the week ahead, investors will be looking ahead to Thursday’s U.S. retail sales report for further indications on the strength of the economic recovery. A rate review by New Zealand’s central bank and the latest U.K. jobs report will also be in focus.

In U.S. trading on Friday, EUR/USD was down 0.12% at 1.3645.
The U.S. Labor Department reported earlier that the economy added 217,000 in May, close to market expectations for a 218,000 increase, after a 282,000 rise in April, whose figure was revised down from a previously estimated 288,000 gain.
The private sector added 216,000 jobs last month, exceeding expectations for a 210,000 gain, which drew market applause and firmed the dollar.
The report also showed that the U.S. unemployment rate remained unchanged at 6.3% last month compared to expectations for a rise to 6.4%.
The data, viewed by markets as not exceptionally robust, was still strong enough to keep expectations firm for the Federal Reserve to continue winding down its monthly bond-buying program, which weakens the dollar by suppressing long-term interest rates.
The Federal Reserve's current bond-buying program, the third since the 2008 financial crisis, has swelled the U.S. central bank's balance sheet to more than $4 trillion today from $2.9 trillion in late 2012.
The euro, meanwhile, continued to come under pressure after the European Central Bank cut its benchmark interest rate on Thursday to a record-low 0.15% from 0.25%, cut its deposit rate to -0.1% and said it will support the banking sector to spur lending via targeted long-term credit injections.
Elsewhere on Friday, official data revealed that Germany's trade surplus widened to €17.7 billion in April from €15.0 billion in March, whose figure was revised up from a previously estimated surplus of €14.8 billion. Analysts had expected the trade surplus to widen to €15.2 billion in April.

In U.S. trading, EUR/USD was down 0.21% at 1.3605, up from a session low of 1.3594 and off a high of 1.3638.
The pair was likely to find support at 1.3586, Thursday's low, and resistance at 1.3650, Friday's high.
The single currency came under pressure on expectations that the European Central Bank will take steps to tackle low inflation rates that are threatening an already fragile recovery in the single currency bloc, including cuts to all interest rates.
Earlier Monday, official data showed that Germany's consumer price index accelerated at an annualized rate of 0.9% last month, down from 1.3% in April. Analysts had expected German consumer prices to rise by 1.1% in May.
Separately, Markit research group said that Spain's manufacturing PMI rose to 52.9 this month, from 52.7 in May, in line with expectations, while Italy's manufacturing PMI slipped to 53.2 in June from 54.0 a month earlier, missing expectations for a 53.7 reading.
Meanwhile in the U.S., the Institute of Supply Management said its manufacturing purchasing managers' index ticked down to 53.2 in May from 54.9 in April, confounding expectations for a rise to 55.5.
Still, markets shrugged off the news, as any figure over 50 signifies expansion.
Elsewhere, the euro was down against the pound, with EUR/GBP down 0.22% at 0.8119, and up against the yen, with EUR/JPY up 0.31% at 139.20.
Markit said the U.K. manufacturing PMI ticked down to 57.0 in June from 57.3 the previous month, in line with expectations.
A separate report showed that net lending to individuals in the U.K. rose by £2.4 billion in April, below expectations for a £2.7 billion increase, after a downwardly revised £2.8 billion gain in March.
On Tuesday, the euro zone is to release preliminary data on consumer inflation as well as a report on the unemployment rate. Spain is also to publish data on the change in the number of people employed.
