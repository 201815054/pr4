40,By Investing.com,"<span>May 22, 2013 09:20PM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar broadly higher on QE tapering concerns,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded higher against nearly all of its major rivals during Thursday’s Asian session a day after U.S. equities plummeted on comments made by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke regarding the possible end of the third round of quantitative easing. In Asian trading Thursday, EUR/USD fell 0.25% to 1.2828 after Bernanke said the Fed’s USD85 billion per month bond-buying program, also known as the third version of quantitative easing, will stay in place for now. That is what financial markets wanted to hear, but the Fed chairman threw a curve ball by saying QE could taper off if conditions in the world’s largest economy improve. In prepared testimony in Congress earlier, Bernanke said ultra-loose monetary policy was providing ""significant benefits"" to the economic recovery and reiterated that the bank’s asset-purchasing program will remain in place for now. GBP/USD dropped 0.22% to 1.5018 after the Office for National Statistics said U.K. retail sales fell 1.3% in April from March, the largest fall in a year and defying market calls for a flat reading. Retail sales rose 0.5% from a year earlier, well below expectations for a 2.0% increase.Separately, the minutes of the Bank of England’s May meeting showed that three policymakers, including Governor Mervyn King, voted in favor of more easing this month, unchanged from April. Bernanke’s dollar-bolstering comments had the predictable impact of sending the greenback soaring against the yen. USD/JPY rose 0.34% to 103.52, a fresh four-and-a-half year high.  USD/CHF jumped 0.35% to 0.9819 while USD/CAD rose 0.24% to 1.0395 as oil prices drifted lower. In U.S. economic news, the National Association of Realtors said existing home sales rose 0.6% last month to an annual rate of 4.97 million units, the highest level since November 2009. With China’s PMI report looming later Thursday, AUD/USD fell 0.63% to 0.9641 while NZD/USD fell 0.51% to 0.8036. China is the largest export destination for both Australia and New Zealand. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.25% to 84.58."

53,By Investing.com,"<span>May 21, 2013 09:16PM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar mixed ahead of Bernanke testimony,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded mixed against its major rivals during Wednesday’s Asian as traders await testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke later Wednesday. In Asian trading Wednesday, EUR/USD rose 0.14% to 1.2925 even after St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said the European Central Bank should consider quantitative easing. While the ECB lowered interest rates following its last meeting, the central bank has been reluctant to engage in quantitative easing. Bullard made the remarks in Germany. USD/JPY gained 0.10% to 102.61 after Japan’s Finance Ministry said the country’s trade deficit widened to a larger-than-expected 879.9 billion yen in April. Exports rose 3.8% to 5.78 trillion yen, but imports increased 9.4% to 6.66 trillion yen. The U.S. was Japan’s largest export market last month. GBP/USD inched up 0.02% to 1.5156. On Tuesday, the Office for National Statistics said the U.K.'s consumer price index slowed to an annual rate of 2.4% in April from 2.8% the previous month, missing expectations for a reading of 2.6%.Month-over-month, consumer price inflation rose 0.2% in April, below expectations for a 0.4% increase, after rising 0.3% in March. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, came in at 2.0% from 2.4% in March. Analysts were expecting a 2.3% reading for core inflation prices. Minutes from the Bank of England’s latest policy meeting are scheduled to be released later Wednesday. USD/CHF fell 0.07% go 0.9697 while USD/CAD inched up 0.02% to 1.0273. AUD/USD fell 0.21% to 0.9787. On Tuesday, a strategist from Credit Agricole said in a media interview that the Aussie has been beaten up and that a lot of the bad news is already priced into the flailing currency. He said the Aussie may continue to fall against the dollar, but called it a good value against the Canadian and New Zealand dollars. NZD/USD fell 0.10% to 0.8164 while the U.S. Dollar Index inched down 0.09% to 83.85."

USD/CAD hit 1.0246 during early U.S. trade, the pair's highest since March 8; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.0229, rising 0.37%.  The pair was likely to find support at 1.0181, the session low and resistance at 1.0337, the high of March 6.  The greenback strengthened broadly after John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said the Fed could begin reducing its monetary easing this summer and end bond buying late this year.  In Canada, official data showed that core consumer price inflation rose 0.1% in April, less than the expected 0.2% increase, after a 0.2% rise the previous month.  Consumer price inflation, including the eight most volatile items, fell 0.2% last month, confounding expectations for a 0.1% rise, after a 0.2% increase in March.  A separate report showed that wholesale sales in Canada rose 0.3% in March, disappointing expectations for a 0.4% gain, after 0.1% increase the previous month.  The loonie was lower against the euro with EUR/CAD gaining 0.31%, to hit 1.3171.  Later in the day, the U.S. was to release preliminary data from the University of Michigan on consumer sentiment and inflation expectations."

EUR/USD hit 1.2851 during late Asian trade, the session low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.2858, slipping 0.17%. The pair was likely to find support at 1.2772, the low of April 1 and resistance at 1.2942, the high of May 15.  The greenback strengthened broadly after John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said the Fed could begin reducing its monetary easing this summer and end bond buying late this year. Meanwhile, the euro remained under pressure after a string of weak economic reports fuelled speculation over an additional rate cut by the European Central Bank. On Wednesday, data showed that the euro zone economy contracted by 0.2% in the three months to March bringing the annualized rate of decline to 0.9%. The euro was steady against the pound with EUR/GBP inching up 0.06%, to hit 0.8441.

144,By Investing.com,"<span>May 13, 2013 09:13PM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar mostly lower amid data points,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded lower against nearly all of its major rivals during Tuesday’s Asian session following a deluge of data points released earlier Tuesday. In Asian trading Tuesday, EUR/USD rose 0.36% to 1.3024 despite headlines that said the euro zone’s current recession is the longest and deepest in the era of the common currency. Economists surveyed believe euro zone GDP fell 0.1% in the first quarter. That would represent a six-quarter decline, worse than what was seen during the global financial crisis.  GBP/USD rose 0.18% to 1.5327 after the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said U.K. housing demand hit a three-and-a-half year high in April. The RICS said its seasonally adjusted house price balance rose +1, though economists expected an increase of +2. The government’s Help to Buy program, announced in March is seen as helping boost U.K. housing demand. USD/JPY fell 0.29% to 101.54 after the Bank of Japan said prices of domestic corporate goods in Japan rose 0.3% in April, easily topping forecasts that called for a 0.1% increase. On a year-over-year basis, prices were flat, but that was better than the expected decline of 0.2%. USD/CHF slid 0.44% to 0.9535 while USD/CAD fell 0.14% to 1.0094 as oil prices inched higher. In U.S. economic news, U.S retail sales rose 0.1% in April following a decline in March. The increase was helped by 1% rise in auto sales. Excluding auto sales, U.S. retail sales fell 0.1% in April. That data was published by the U.S. Commerce Department. AUD/USD jumped 0.35% to 0.9989 as the Aussie continues to battle it out with the greenback at the parity level. NZD/USD climbed 0.36% to 0.8281 after Statistics New Zealand said real retail sales there rose 0.5% in the first quarter compared with a fourth-quarter gain of 1.9%. Including price changes, New Zealand retail sales rose 0.7%, but economists expected an increase of 1.1%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.29% to 83.11."

479,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 22, 2013 10:13PM ET</span>",Forex - AUD/USD slides following China PMI ,"Investing.com - The Australian dollar slid against its U.S. rival during Tuesday’s Asian session after the HSBC flash reading of China’s April purchasing managers index indicated the world’s second-largest economy is cooling a bit. In Asian trading Tuesday, AUD/USD slipped 0.44% to 1.0230. That took the pair below support at 1.0249, the low of February 25. The pair is likely to find resistance at 1.0337, the high of April 18.  The flash HSBC Purchasing Managers' Index for April fell to 50.5 from 51.6 in March. The April reading is ahead of the February reading of 50.4. Readings above 50 indicate expansion. The new export orders index fell to 48.6 in April from 50.5 in March, highlighting the fact that the global economic recovery remains tepid. China’s PMI report comes barely more than one week after the country said its first-quarter GDP grew by 7.7%, disappointing analysts that expected growth of 8%. For the Aussie, the China PMI comes just a day after the it was revealed that a budget deficit down under is all but a foregone conclusion for the current fiscal year. Australian Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan said the government there has taken a AUD7.5 billion revenue hit since October. Late last year, Australian bankers and policymakers abandoned hopes for a possible budget surplus in the current fiscal year. There is some speculation that the budget deficit could be as high as AUD20 billion, though Deloitte Access Economics said that figure is too high. The budget deficit could be the result of declining mining revenue and government spending on programs such as education, health care and infrastructure. Australia’s next budget is scheduled to be released on May 14. Given news of the deficit and the recently concerning Chinese economic data points, some traders may look to the Reserve Bank of Australia to perhaps lower interest rates when it meets early next month. However, the majority of market participants expect RBA to stand pat and hold interest rates at 3%. Elsewhere, AUD/JPY dipped 0.55% to 101.41 while EUR/AUD gained 0.25% to 1.2756."

546,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 17, 2013 10:01PM ET</span>",Forex - NZD/USD falls modestly on weak risk appetite,"Investing.com – The New Zealand dollar fell against its U.S. counterpart during Thursday’s Asian session as traders took a pass on some of the riskier currencies. In Asian trading Thursday, NZD/USD inched lower by 0.05% to 0.8437 after earlier trading as high as 0.8454 and as low as 0.8422. The pair was likely to find support at 0.8378, the low of April 15 and resistance at 0.8510, Tuesday's high. Following another rough day for U.S. stocks on Wednesday, including the second triple-digit loss in three days for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, traders appeared to be limiting risk appetite in Asia Thursday. Earlier Thursday, Real Estate Institute of New Zealand data showed the median price per hectare for rural land rose 11.3% to NZD22,317 per hectare in March from March 2012. The March reading was a 1.7% increase from February. Farm sales slightly eased. On Wednesday, official data showed that New Zealand's consumer price inflation rose 0.4% in the first quarter, in line with expectations, after a 0.2% decline in the previous quarter. EUR/NZD nudged up 0.06% to 1.5454 after after European Central Bank after ECB Governing Council member Jens Weidmann said the bank could cut interest rates if economic and inflation data indicated that it was warranted. The International Monetary Fund recently said the the ECB should take steps, perhaps including an interest rate cut, to bolster the flailing euro zone economy. NZD/JPY fell 0.21% to 82.67 after Japan’s Ministry of Finance said the country’s exports rose 1.1% last month, easily topping the 0.4% increase forecast by economists. Japanese exports dropped 2.9% in February. For the fiscal year ending in March, Japan showed a trade deficit of JPY8.17 trillion. "
547,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 17, 2013 09:25PM ET</span>",Forex - USD/JPY falls after trade balance data ,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen during Thursday’s Asian session following the release of Japan’s March trade balance data. In Asian trading Thursday, USD/JPY fell 0.39% to 97.75. The pair was likely to find support at 97.51, the session low and resistance at 99.79, the high of April 12. In a report, Japan’s Ministry of Finance said the country’s exports rose 1.1% last month, easily topping the 0.4% increase forecast by economists. Japanese exports dropped 2.9% in February. For the fiscal year ending in March, Japan showed a trade deficit of JPY8.17 trillion. Still, the export number indicates Japan’s weaker yen policy is starting to pay dividends for exports in the world’s third-largest economy. Elsewhere, the Reuters Tankan survey for April showed sentiment improved among Japanese manufacturers this month, the fifth straight month that has happened. Other data showed that Japanese investors were net sellers of foreign bonds for a fifth straight week, prompting some concern that the Bank of Japan’s ultra-loose monetary policy is not having the desired impact on the country’s domestic economy. Even with the benefit of these positive data points, the yen fell against the greenback as traders turned their attention to the G20 meeting, which kicks off in Washington later Thursday. Traders may be indicating they are concerned Japan will be met with criticism at the meeting for allowing the yen to depreciate too rapidly this year. The Japanese currency is currently sporting double-digit year-to-date losses against the U.S. dollar and the euro. Meanwhile, EUR/JPY dropped 0.33% to 127.50 while AUD/JPY slipped 0.47% to 100.60. NZD/JPY fell 0.46% to 82.46."

621,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 12, 2013 11:39AM ET</span>",Dollar pares gains vs. rivals but remains supported ,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar pared gains against the other major currencies on Friday, after news of a final deal on a bailout for Cyprus, although concerns over the strength of the economic recovery in the U.S. weighed on the greenback. During U.S. morning trade, the dollar was steady against the euro, with EUR/USD easing 0.06% to 1.3091. At a meeting in Dublin, euro zone finance ministers backed a EUR10 billion bailout for Cyprus and the European Commission said it would try to help the island's economy grow again with better use of EU structural funds. The ministerial support opens the way for several euro zone countries to seek approval for the three-year bailout in national parliaments in order for the loan agreement to be signed by April 24.  In addition, European Union finance ministers agreed to extend the maturities of emergency loans extended to Ireland and Portugal by seven years.  Earlier Friday, official data showed that industrial production rose 0.4% in February, more than the expected 0.3% increase, after a 0.2% rise the previous month. The greenback was higher against the pound, with GBP/USD slipping 0.14% to 1.5363.  Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY retreating 0.76% to trade at 98.89, and with USD/CHF edging down 0.17% to 0.9293. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda earlier said the central bank will not set a time limit for easing and will continue until it achieves sustainable inflation.  The greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD edging up 0.19% to 1.0123, AUD/USD falling 0.22% to 1.0522 and NZD/USD retreating 0.45% to 0.8592. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.04% to 82.33.  In the U.S., the University of Michigan said its index of consumer sentiment declined far more-than-expected in April, falling to 72.3 from a reading of 78.6 the previous month. Analysts had expected the index to tick down to 78.5 this month.  The report came after official data showed that retail sales in the U.S. fell 0.4% in March, disappointing expectations for a 0.1% rise, after a 1% increase the previous month.  Core retail sales, which exclude automobiles also slipped 0.4% last month, after a 1% increase in February, compared to expectations for a 0.1% rise.  A separate report showed that U.S. producer price inflation, including food and energy, ticked down 0.6% in March, more than the expected 0.2% slip, after a 0.7% gain the previous month.  Core producer price inflation rose 0.2% last month, in line with expectations, following a 0.2% increase in February.  Investors were also eyeing an upcoming speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke for indications of the future possible direction of monetary policy."

715,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 07, 2013 10:00PM ET</span>",Forex - USD/JPY continues to surge,"Investing.com - On the heels of a stunning rally seen last week, the U.S. dollar is again soaring against the Japanese yen during Monday’s Asian session. In Asian trading Monday, USD/JPY is up 0.95% at 98.46 after earlier trading as high 98.85, the highest level in nearly four years. The pair is likely to find support at 95.73, Friday’s low and resistance at 98.88, the high of June 5, 2009. The yen dropped more than 3% against the dollar on Thursday after the Bank of Japan said it plans to double its asset purchase program over the next two years and extend the maturities of the bonds it purchases.Traders also ditched the yen following the current account deficit report. Earlier today, the Ministry of Finance said that Japan’s current account balance for the first quarter was JPY637.4 billion, well above the JPY457.5 billion median estimate. Along with the greenback, other major currencies have surged against the yen in recent days as BoJ, under the stewardship of new Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, plans to expand its asset purchase program to JPY7 trillion per month and include 10-year government bonds, real estate investment trusts and exchange trade funds. BoJ will publish the minutes from last week’s monetary policy meeting tomorrow. On Thursday, Japan will publish official data on core machinery orders and on Friday, the country will release official data on tertiary industry activity. With recent action in USD/JPY it could be just a matter of time before the pair reaches 100, a price level last seen in April 2009. Some traders have said the pair could see 102-103 later this month. Elsewhere, EUR/JPY is up 0.80% at 127.85 while AUD/JPY jumped 0.72% to 102.08. NZD/JPY rose 0.61% to 82.77."
716,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 07, 2013 09:43PM ET</span>", Forex - EUR/USD falls as Portugal seen roiling euro ,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar is trading higher against the euro during Monday’s Asian session as new fears regarding the financial stability of Portugal have crept into the marketplace. In Asian trading Monday, EUR/USD is lower by 0.10% at 1.2992. The pair was likely to find support at 1.2747, Thursday’s low, and resistance at 1.3039, Friday’s high. Traders are parting with ways the euro in favor of the dollar after Portuguese Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho said the government will have reduce spending. Last Friday, a court invalidated some of Portugal’s austerity measures that were implemented in 2011 as part of a bailout package. Last Friday, Portugal’s Constitutional Court ruled against a 2013 budge that include EUR5 billion in tax hikes, leaving the country short EUR1.4 billion in expected revenue. Portugal, the ""P"" in the popular PIIGS acronym, was the third euro zone member after fellow PIIGS members Greece and Ireland to receive bailout assistance. Last month, Cyprus received a bailout of EUR10 billion. Coelho unveiled cuts to health and education spending instead of another tax increase in a speech that followed an emergency session of his cabinet on Saturday. Last year, Portugal failed to meet budget deficit reduction goals set forth by the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank.  Portugal’s economy, like so many others in the euro zone, contracted in 2012, but at a brutal clip of 3.2%. In a statement released earlier today, the European Commission said, ""Continued and determined implementation of the programme ... is a precondition for a decision on the lengthening of the maturities of the financial assistance to Portugal, which would facilitate Portugal's return to the financial markets and the attainment of the programme's objectives. Elsewhere, EUR/JPY is higher by 0.93% at 128.02 while EUR/AUD is up 0.10% at 1.2528. EUR/GBP is down 0.04% at 0.8472."

782,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 02, 2013 10:06PM ET</span>",Forex - AUD/USD rises on trade balance data,"Investing.com - The Australian dollar is trading slightly higher against its U.S. rival during Wednesday’s Asian session following the release of February trade balance data. In Asian trading Wednesday, AUD/USD is higher by 0.03% at 1.0454. The pair was likely to find support at 1.0418, the low of March 27 and resistance at 1.0497, the high of March 26 and a two-month high. Earlier today, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said that Australia’s trade balance narrowed to AUD178 million in February from a AUD1.215 billion deficit in the previous month. Economists expected a deficit of AUD1 billion. While some economists expect Australian exports to increase throughout the remainder of the year, it is also widely expected that prices will continue to fall, keeping the Australian trade deficit in the red.  In other news related to Australian trade, China's official purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the services sector climbed to 55.6 in March from 54.5 in February. Readings above 50 indicate expansion. The bullish number was helped by increased construction activity.  China’s National Bureau of Statistics said the construction index jumped 4.5 points from February to 62.5 in March. China is the largest trading partner for both Australia and New Zealand. The Aussie was also supported by the Reserve Bank of Australia opting to leave interest rates unchanged at 3% following its meeting on Tuesday. Commenting on the decision, RBA Governor Glenn Stevens said that ""there are a number of indications that the substantial easing of monetary policy during late 2011 and 2012 is having an expansionary effect"". Elsewhere, AUD/JPY is up 0.24% at 97.87 while EUR/AUD is lower by 0.16% at 1.2248."
783,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 02, 2013 09:34PM ET</span>",Forex - USD/JPY higher as traders eye BoJ meeting,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar is trading higher against the Japanese yen Wednesday as traders are keeping close watch on the two-day Bank of Japan monetary policy that kicks off today. In Asian trading Wednesday, USD/JPY rose 0.21% to 93.62. The pair was likely to find support at 92.43, the low of March 1 and resistance at 94.10, the high of March 6. Today, BoJ starts its first meeting with Governor Haruhiko Kuroda at the helm. Given Kuroda’s vocal criticism of the previous BoJ regime and his recent pledge to do whatever it take to get Japan’s rate of inflation up to 2%, yen bears risk disappointment if Kuroda is unable to deliver new monetary stimulus measures. Importantly, traders will want those measures, if announced, to go into effect immediately. Earlier this year, before Kuroda was named the new BoJ governor, the central bank approved additional bond-buying, but disappointed markets by saying that program would not start until next year. Yen bulls do have some hope, however, as chatter has increased that Kuroda has been able to convince all of the BoJ members to approve additional, imminent monetary easing. With so many yen bears waiting for that to happen, the currency could be vulnerable to short-covering if Kuroda does not deliver. Elsewhere, EUR/JPY rose 0.04% to 119.80. The pair sought to test support at 118.77, the low from Feb. 25, and resistance at 120.14, the earlier high and is still flirting with four-month lows. On Tuesday, official data showed the euro zone’s unemployment rate was 12% in February, meaning 19 million people are out of work. The Markit Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index dropped to 46.8 last month, well below the 47.9 posted in February. Readings below 50 indicate contraction. GBP/JPY is up 0.04% at 141.18 ahead of the Bank of England meeting tomorrow. AUD/JPY advanced 0.26% to 97.89."
784,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 02, 2013 08:50PM ET</span>","Forex - Dollar mixed ahead of BoJ, ECB meetings","Investing.com - The U.S. dollar is mixed against its major rivals during Wednesday’s Asian session as traders look to monetary policy meetings by the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank for monetary easing clues. In Asian trading Wednesday, EUR/USD fell 0.02% to 1.2816 after official data showed the euro zone’s unemployment rate was 12% in February, meaning 19 million people are out of work. The Markit Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index dropped to 46.8 last month, well below the 47.9 posted in February. Readings below 50 indicate contraction. Given Europe’s slack economic data and the euro zone’s record high unemployment rate, some traders are hoping the ECB surprises markets with an interest rate, but most view that as unlikely. USD/JPY gained 0.17% to 93.58. BoJ starts its first meeting with Governor Haruhiko Kuroda at the helm. With rumors swirling that Kuroda has not yet convinced all the BoJ deputy governors that more bond buying is necessary to boost Japan’s economy, yen bears risk severe disappointment when the meeting concludes tomorrow. GBP/USD is lower by 0.01% at 1.5104. The Bank of England also meets Thursday, though traders are not expecting any interest rate changes. USD/CHF is up 0.01% at 0.9492 while USD/CAD is down 0.02% at 1.0145 as oil prices are off a bit today. Later today, the U.S. Energy Information Administration will release weekly data on crude inventories and chatter among traders indicates they expect an increase. That would not be surprising as U.S. oil output is soaring, but demand remains sluggish. AUD/USD is up 0.11% at 1.0462. On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia surprised no one by leaving rates unchanged at 3%. NZD/USD slipped 0.13% to 0.8408 while the U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.03% to 83.13."

In Asian trading Wednesday, EUR/USD is higher by 0.02% at 1.2865. The Cyprus bailout deal, announced Tuesday, guaranteed that accounts holding EUR100,000 or less will continue to be insured and likely moved to another financial institution, though the fates of larger accounts remained up in the air, with depositors and bondholders facing haircuts.  Earlier this week, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers, said that model could be applied throughout Europe. That made market participants jittery, but French President Francoise Hollande and Spain's prime minister, Mario Rajoy sought to assuage investors by saying Cyprus is a unique situation. GBP/USD is up 0.03% at 1.5165 while USD/JPY is higher by 0.19% at 94.63. On Tuesday, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said earlier he wanted to see inflation rates rise to 2% in two years and added he'd advocate buying more government debt to reach that goal. USD/CHF fell 0.01% to 0.9480 while USD/CAD is up 0.02% at 1.0164. In U.S. economic news, the Conference Board said its March reading of consumer confidence fell to 59.7 from a revised 68 in February. Economists expected a March reading of 68.7. The Commerce Department said durable goods orders rose 5.7% in February after falling 3.8% in January. Economists expected a February increase of 4.9%. Core orders fell 0.5%. Economists expected a core increase of 0.5%. The Commerce Department also said new home sales fell 4.6% last month to seasonally-adjusted rate of 411,000, but rose 12.3% on a year-over-year basis. The S&P/Case Shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metro areas rose 0.9% in December on a seasonally-adjusted basis. On a non-adjusted basis, the index rose 0.2%. Economists expected a seasonally-adjusted increase of 0.5%. Ahead of the release of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s financial stability review, AUD/USD is down 0.09% at 1.0476. NZD/USD is off 0.04% at 0.8349. The U.S. Dollar Index is lower by 0.01% at 83.01."

USD/JPY hit 93.54 during early European trade, the session low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 94.16, easing 0.02%. The pair was likely to find support at 93.01, the low of March 6 and resistance at 95.06, the high of March 22.  The yen remained under pressure after the new BoJ Governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, reaffirmed his commitment to bold monetary easing to achieve 2% inflation. Kuroda said the central bank will discuss purchasing more bonds with longer maturities. The BoJ currently buys government debt maturing in three years or less through its JPY76 trillion asset-purchase program. Meanwhile, markets were jittery after the head of the Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, said on Monday that the rescue program agreed for Cyprus represents a new model for resolving euro zone banking problems and other countries may have to restructure their banking sectors. He later appeared to backtrack, saying Cyprus was a specific case with exceptional challenges. The yen was fractionally higher against the euro with EUR/JPY edging down 0.09%, to hit 120.91. Later in the day, the U.S. was to release government reports on durable goods orders and new home sales as well as a report on consumer confidence. "

896,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 25, 2013 11:51AM ET</span>",Dollar mixed vs. rivals in cautious trade ,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was mixed against the other major currencies in light trade on Monday, as news of an international bailout deal for Cyprus supported sentiment, although comments by Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem dampened investor confidence. During U.S. morning trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD retreating 0.81% to 1.2886.  The euro weakened broadly after Jeroen Dijsselbloemsaid the rescue program agreed for Cyprus represents a new template for resolving euro zone banking problems and other countries may have to restructure their banking sectors.  Early Monday, euro zone finance ministers approved a EUR10 billion international bailout for Cyprus that will see the closure of the country’s second largest lender Laiki Bank and inflict heavy losses deposits of more than EUR100,000.However, all bank deposits under EUR100,000 will be ""fully guaranteed"".Investors remained cautious however, as concerns over the economic outlook for the euro zone and political uncertainty in Italy weighed. The greenback was also higher against the pound, with GBP/USD shedding 0.32% to 1.5182.  Elsewhere, the greenback was steady against the yen, with USD/JPY dipping 0.02% to trade at 94.46, but higher against the Swiss franc with USD/CHF advancing 0.67% to 0.9467.  The dollar looked likely to remain supported close to recent three-and-a-half year highs against the yen as expectations for more aggressive easing steps by the Bank of Japan under new Governor Haruhiko Kuroda remained intact ahead of the bank’s upcoming policy meeting next week.  The greenback was mixed to lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD slipping 0.09% to 1.0219, AUD/USD adding 0.11% to 1.0457 and NZD/USD easing 0.08% to 0.8347. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.49% to 82.93. Investors were looking ahead to a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke later in the trading day.Last week, the U.S. central bank announced that it will leave monetary policy unchanged in spite of recent signs that the U.S. economic recovery is deepening."

954,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 20, 2013 10:26PM ET</span>",Forex - USD/JPY slightly lower following trade deficit news,"Investing.com – The Japanese yen is trading modestly lower against the U.S. dollar in Thursday’s Asian session following some downbeat trade deficit news out of Asia’s second-largest economy. In Asian trading Thursday, USD/JPY is lower by 0.06% at 95.96. The pair is likely to find support at 95.80 and resistance at 96. Earlier today, Japan’s finance ministry said shipments slipped 2.9% in February, far worse than 1.7% decreased economists expected. Imports climbed nearly 12% creating an overall trade deficit of USD8.1 billion. While the yen is down 10% against the greenback on a year-to-date basis, economists noted it takes some time for the slumping currency to have a positive impact on Japan’s trade situation. The February trade deficit was the eighth consecutive for Japan, marking the country’s worst such string in more than three decades. Japan’s exports to China slipped 15.8% last month, a drop attributed to the Lunar New Year, but ongoing weakness in the euro zone is also hampering Japanese exporters. Japan, the world’s third-largest economy behind the U.S. and China, saw its imports to the European Union slide 9.6% in February. On Monday, Goldman Sachs boosted its forecast for Japan’s 2013 GDP growth to 2.3% from 2.1%, noting the weaker yen is often quickly seen in imports, but that benefits to exporters take longer to materialize. Meanwhile, there is chatter that new Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may make remarks later today about regarding quickly reaching Japan’s desired 2% rate of inflation. Elsewhere, EUR/JPY is up 0.07% at 124.30 while AUD/JPY is lower by 0.02% at 99.64. NZD/JPY is soaring 0.54% to 79.38 on the back of a strong-than-expected fourth-quarter GDP report out of New Zealand."

1037,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 15, 2013 05:22AM ET</span>","Forex - USD/JPY edges lower, but downside seen limited ","Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower against the yen on Friday, but remained supported amid recent signs of a strengthening U.S. economic recovery, while Japan's parliament approved the Bank of Japan governor. USD/JPY hit 95.89 during European morning trade, the session low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 96.02, slipping 0.09%. The pair was likely to find support at 94.84, the low of March 8 and resistance at 96.68, the high of March 12. The dollar remained supported after the Department of Labor said the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. fell by 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 332,000, last week compared to expectations for an increase of 8,000 to 350,000.The unexpectedly strong data, together with recent stronger-than-forecast data on nonfarm payrolls and retail sales fuelled optimism over the durability of the U.S. economic recovery.  Earlier Friday, Japan's parliament approved Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's nominee for central bank governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, and nominees for the two deputy governor posts, clearing the way for radical monetary easing measures. The yen was lower against the euro with EUR/JPY adding 0.21%, to hit 125.24. Later in the day, the U.S. was to produce official data on consumer inflation and preliminary data from the University of Michigan on consumer sentiment, followed by reports data on industrial production, and manufacturing activity in New York state."

1143,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 07, 2013 10:39PM ET</span>",Forex - AUD/USD down after China export data,"Investing.com - The Australian dollar slipped against its U.S. rival during Friday’s Asian despite a stronger-than-expected Chinese export report. In Asian trading Friday, AUD/USD fell 0.27% to 1.0241. The pair was likely to find support at 1.0193, the low of March 5 and resistance at 1.0301, Wednesday's high. The Aussie came under additional pressure despite a report showing China’s January and February combined exports jumped 23.6%, easily topping analysts’ expectations for a 17.6% increase. What seems to be ailing the Aussie is China’s import number. The world’s second-largest economy behind the U.S. said February imports rose just 5% last month, well below the 10% increase economists expected. Industrial output data for January and February is expected to show a 10.5% increase when that number is published. Despite what is one of the strongest Chinese data points this years, the import number appears to be what traders are focusing on because China is the largest destination for Australian exports such as iron ore and other commodities. The Aussie was not the only currency to wilt in the wake of the import number. NZD/USD slid 0.33% to 0.8258. The pair was likely to find support at 0.8241, the low of February 28 and resistance at 0.8332, the high of March 5. As is the case with Australia, China is New Zealand’s largest trading partner. Despite scuffling against the greenback, the Aussie is trading higher against some of the other forex majors. AUD/JPY rose 0.28% to 97.66. GBP/AUD rose slightly, but the Aussie is still flirting with record highs against both the yen and sterling, the two worst-performing develop market currencies in the world this year."

During European morning trade, the dollar was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD shedding 0.22% to 1.3028.  The euro came under pressure after preliminary data showed that consumer price inflation in the euro zone ticked down to an annualized rate of 1.8% in February, from a rate of 2.0% the previous month.  A separate report showed that the unemployment rate in the euro zone rose to a new record high of 11.9% in January from 11.8% the previous month. Analysts had expected the rate to remain unchanged at 11.8% in January.  Earlier Friday, Markit research group said that Spain's manufacturing purchasing managers' index improved to 46.8 in February from 46.1 the previous month, beating expectations for a rise to 46.5, while Italy's manufacturing PMI fell to 45.8 last month from 47.8 in January, compared to expectations for a reading of 47.6.  In addition, official data showed that German retail sales rose 3.1% in January, beating expectations for a 1% increase, after a 2.1% decline the previous month. The greenback was also higher against the pound, with GBP/USD dropping 0.89% to 1.5028.  The pound dropped to 31-month lows against the greenback after Markit said that the U.K. manufacturing PMI deteriorated unexpectedly in February, falling to 47.9 from a reading of 50.8 the previous month, re-entering contraction territory for the first time since December.  Analysts had expected the index to rise to 51.0 last month.  In a separate report, the Bank of England said that net lending to individuals fell to GBP0.6 billion in January, from GBP1.8 billion the previous month, exceeding expectations for a decline to GBP1.1 billion. Elsewhere, the greenback was higher against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY advancing 0.37% to trade at 92.90, and with USD/CHF rising 0.38% to 0.9401.  In Switzerland, data showed that the SVME PMI fell to 50.8 in February from a reading of 52.5 the previous month, compared to expectations for a reading of 52.2.  The greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD edging up 0.14% to 1.0321, AUD/USD slipping 0.18% to 1.0196 and NZD/USD falling 0.10% to 0.8240.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.32% to 82.25.  Markets were also jittery as automatic spending cuts in the U.S. worth USD85 billion were due to be introduced on Friday after U.S. lawmakers failed to reach a deal to avert them.  U.S. President Barack Obama invited congressional leaders to the White House for last minute negotiations before the 11.59pm deadline.  Later in the day, the U.S. was to release a report from the Institute of Supply Management on manufacturing activity, official data on personal spending and revised data on consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan."

1334,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 24, 2013 09:47PM ET</span>",Forex - USD/JPY soars on Kuroda speculation,"Investing.com – The U.S. dollar is seen surging against the Japanese yen during Monday’s Asian session on reports that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is close to naming a new Bank of Japan governor. In Asian trading Monday, USD/JPY jumped 0.85% to 94.16 after earlier trading as high as 94.45. The pair is likely to find support at 92.66, the low of February 14 and resistance at 94.45, the high of February 11 and a two-and-a-half-year high. The yen slid following press reports that said Asian Development Bank President Haruhiko Kuroda will likely be the new BoJ leader. Traders view Kuroda as a proponent of strong monetary easing, which explains the yen’s weakness today. Add to that, the same press reports that mentioned Kuroda as the leading contender to be the central bank’s next leaders noted that Kikuo Iwata is inline to land a role as deputy governor. Iwata also has a reputation for favoring aggressive monetary easing. USD/JPY slid a bit last week on rumors that Toshiro Muto might be atop the list to be the next BoJ leader. Muto is not as dovish in his approach to easing and is believed to favor other means of stimulating Japan’s fragile economy. Outgoing Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa and two deputy governors leave their roles next month. Shirakawa has come under some criticism from Abe for not being bold enough in his approach to monetary easing, though it should be noted the central bank recently boosted its inflation target to 2% from 1% to match Abe’s desired rate of inflation. This week, other events that could move the yen include the release of official data on retail sales, the government measure of consumer spending, which accounts for the majority of overall economic activity. That number is due out Wednesday while Japan’s industrial production number follows on Thursday. Elsewhere, EUR/JPY climbed 0.82% to 124.13 while AUD/JPY rose 0.30% 96.65."
1335,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 24, 2013 09:13PM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar strong ahead of Italy election results,"Investing.com – At the start of what has the potential to be a volatile week in the currency markets, the U.S. dollar is trading higher against all of its major rivals during Monday’s Asian session. In Asian trading Monday, EUR/USD fell 0.04% to USD1.3183 as voters in Italy head to the polls. Polling ends at 9AM local time today with euro bulls nervous that former Prime Minister Silvio Belusconi could retake his old job. Berlusconi has promised to unwind current Prime Minister Mario Monti’s austerity efforts, a move that some view as possibly hastening Italy’s departure from the euro zone. The country is the euro zone’s third-largest economy behind Germany and France. GBP/USD slipped 0.28% to 1.5132. On Friday after the close of U.S. markets, Moody’s Investors Service stripped the U.K. of its AAA credit rating, citing slack economic growth and a rising debt burden. Sterling, which fell to a two-and-a-half year low against the dollar on Thursday, is already showing signs of trading lower against the greenback. USD/JPY surged 0.79% to 94.10 on reports that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government is preparing to name Asian Development Bank President Haruhiko Kuroda as the next Bank of Japan governor. Markets seem to favor the choice because of Kuroda’s reputation for supporting bold monetary easing initiatives. Meanwhile, USD/CHF climbed 0.18% to 0.9316 while USD/CAD advanced 0.35% to 1.0240 In the week ahead, testimony on monetary policy by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke in Congress will be closely watched, while data on economic growth from the U.S., U.K., Switzerland and Canada will also be in focus. Additional signs that traders are passing on riskier currencies in favor of the greenback are evident. AUD/USD is off 0.51% at 1.0268 while NZD/USD is down 0.27% at 0.8356. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.23% at 81.74."

1443,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 17, 2013 10:37PM ET</span>",Forex - USD/JPY jumps following G20 meeting,"Investing.com - The Japanese yen tumbled against the U.S. dollar during Monday’s Asian session after G20 leaders vowed not to punish Japan due its rapidly depreciating currency. In Asian trading Monday, USD/JPY jumped 0.73% to 94.19. Earlier in the session, the pair traded as high as 94.22. The pair was likely to find support at 92.23, Friday’s low, and resistance at 94.41, Tuesday’s high. During the two-day G20 meeting in Moscow, monetary policy officials avoided overt criticism of Japan due to the weaker yen, but the leaders did say that members would ""refrain from competitive devaluation"" and said that risks to the world economy had receded but growth remained too weak and unemployment too high. While taking a strong stand against currency manipulation, G20 officials indicated they will allow the yen to continue sliding as long as Japanese officials and policymakers do not make public statements to push the currency lower. That opens the door for Japan to continue stimulating its economy, the world’s third-largest, and perhaps engage in asset-buying sooner-than-expected. Earlier this year, the Bank of Japan said it would engage in open-ended asset-buying, but the central bank disappointed markets by delaying the start of that effort until 2014.  Regarding BoJ, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is in the process of selecting a new governor to lead the central bank to replace Masaaki Shirakaw who steps down next month. Earlier today, at least one media outlet reported that Toshiro Muto is the leading candidate to be the next BoJ governor and that Abe could make an announcement to that effect as early as this week. Muto, formerly a BoJ deputy governor from 2003 to 2008, is seen as keeping with Abe’s efforts to jolt the slumbering Japanese economy through monetary easing and higher inflation. Abe has pledged to appoint a new BoJ governor that is willing to take bold action and engage in unlimited easing. Elsewhere, EUR/JPY advanced 0.38% to 125.43 while AUD/JPY gained 0.36% to 96.75. "

1537,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 11, 2013 09:34PM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar mostly lower amid quiet Asian trade ,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded mostly lower against its major rivals in what is looking like another quiet Asian session on Tuesday. Markets in Hong Kong, Shanghai and others across the region remain closed for Chinese New Year festivities. In Asian trading Tuesday, EUR/USD fell 0.03% to 1.3401 after rising 0.12% during Monday’s U.S. session. Comments from Jens Weidmann, European Central Bank member and president of Germany's central bank, regarding the euro not being overvalued helped lift the common currency as did some solid French economic data. France's industrial output contracted by 0.1% in December from the month before, less than market calls for a 0.2% contraction though still down from November's 0.5% gain. France is the euro zone’s second-largest economy behind Germany. GBP/USD was flat at 1.5660 after the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said its U.K. home price index slid to -4 last month from -1 in December. The measure of newly agreed upon sales jumped to 15 from 2, according to RICS. USD/JPY dipped 0.11% to 94.24 following reports that Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said he well the group of G20 nations at an upcoming meeting that Japan is trying to curb deflation, not manipulating the yen lower. Aso recently came under fire for comments about the yen weakening too quickly against the dollar, but Japan itself has been accused of manipulating the yen lower. Some nations, including Germany and South Korea, have promised retaliatory action if the yen continues to plummet. Finance and central bank leaders from the G20 nations meet in Moscow on Friday and Saturday. Elsewhere, USD/CHF rose 0.03% to 0.9207 while USD/CAD added 0.08% to 1.0058. AUD/USD climbed 0.10% to 1.0266 even after reports that traders are increasing bets that the Reserve Bank of Australia will pare rates later this year. Some traders are betting on nearly 50 more basis points being shaved from RBA’s key overnight rate, currently 3%. Even a 25 basis point reduction to 2.75% would take Australian interest rates to a record low. NZD/USD jumped 0.18% to 0.8366 while the U.S. Dollar Index added 0.06%."

In Asian trading Monday, EUR/USD rose 0.02% to 1.3373 after earlier touching a two-week low due to lingering uncertainty about the situations in Italy and Spain. Last week, the euro was hit after Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy faced calls for his resignation amid allegations of graft. News that Silvio Berlusconi is gaining ground in Italy’s race for prime minister also weighted on the common currency. Italy and Spain are the euro zone’s third-largest and fourth-largest economies, respectively. Later today, France is scheduled to release official data on industrial production while eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers is to hold talks in Brussels. GBP/USD rose 0.04% to 1.5806 after the Bank of England held interest rates steady last week and indicated the U.K. economy is recovering slowly. On Tuesday, the U.K. will release data on consumer prices, which account for a majority of overall inflation as well as industry data on house prices. USD/JPY slid 0.25% to 92.49 after Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said the currency has fallen more than policymakers intended it to fall in recent weeks. Aso joins some other Japanese leaders, a group that does not include Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, in recently saying that the yen has fallen too far too fast, particularly against the U.S. dollar. Japan releases preliminary data on fourth quarter gross domestic product on Thursday. Markets there are closed today due to the Chinese New Year. Elsewhere, USD/CHF rose 0.08% to 0.9179 while USD/CAD climbed 0.10% to 1.0042. AUD/USD slid 0.13% 1.0313 after Australian home-loan approvals dropped in December for a third consecutive month. Loans for new homes fell 1.5% in December, more than double the 0.7% November decline. NZD/USD fell 0.14% to 0.8349 while the U.S. Dollar Index dropped 0.06% to 80.24."

EUR/USD pulled away from 1.3430, the session high, to hit 1.3379 during European afternoon trade, slipping 0.14%.  The pair was likely to find support at 1.3287, the low of January 25 and resistance at 1.3479, the high of January 25.  The euro remained under pressure after ECB President Draghi said on Thursday that economic weakness in the euro area would persist during the early part of 2013 but said the economy should start to recover “later” in the year.  He added that the recent appreciation in the single currency reflected growing signs of a return of investor confidence in the euro zone.  Meanwhile, European Union leaders agreed on the first-ever cuts in the bloc’s budget.  The agreement should set a 2014-2020 spending ceiling of EUR960 billion, down from an original proposal of EUR1.047 trillion and less than the EUR994 billion spent in the current budget cycle.  In the U.S., official data showed that the trade deficit narrowed more-than-expected in December, moving to USD38.5 billion from a deficit of USD48.6 billion.  Analysts had expected the trade deficit to narrow to USD46 billion in December.  Elsewhere, the euro was lower against the pound with EUR/GBP dropping 0.74%, to hit 0.8464.  Also Friday, a report showed that China's trade surplus narrowed less-than-expected in January, falling to USD29.20 billion from a surplus of USD31.60 billion, compared to expectations for a fall to USD22 billion.  The data added to hopes that the world's second largest economy is on the road to recovery."

1582,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 07, 2013 09:13PM ET</span>","Forex - Dollar mixed, but risk appetite seen waning","Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was mixed against its major rivals during Friday’s Asian session, but risk appetite appeared to be scant as traders are pensive after some central bank commentary Thursday and ahead of Chinese data releases later today. In Asian trading Friday, EUR/USD jumped 0.03% to 1.3404, reversing losses seen earlier in the session. On Thursday, the dollar rallied following comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi. Draghi said the ECB is keeping a watchful eye on the euro’s recent strength for possible signs of euro zone inflation. GBP/USD rose 0.05% to 1.5720 after the Bank of England announced no significant monetary policy changes on Thursday. BoE did acknowledge the stage is set for the U.K. economy to recover, but the central added that the recovery will be slow.  USD/JPY fell 0.09% to 93.57 after Japan reported a December current account deficit of JPY264.1 billion, well above the consensus estimate of JPY144.2 billion. That pared the full-year current account surplus to JPY4.7 trillion. A weaker yen, which is believed to be boosting Japanese exports, is seen as helping the current account situation a bit. Meanwhile, USD/CHF fell 0.04% to 91.80 while USD/CAD gained 0.03% to 99.82 even though oil prices were steady in Asian trade. Elsewhere, AUD/USD added 0.05% to 1.0289 after the Reserve Bank of Australia lowered its 2013 GDP growth outlook to 2.5% from its November forecast of 2.75%. RBA also trimmed its inflation estimate to 3% from 3.25%. The Aussie dollar should be in focus later today when China, one of Australia’s largest trading partners, reports inflation and trade data. RBA also said the Aussie dollar’s strength impact on inflation may be longer-lasting than expected. NZD/USD jumped 0.23% to 0.8353. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.07% to 80.23. In Thursday’s U.S. economic news, first-time claims for jobless benefits fell by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 366,000 last week, according to the Labor Department. The less volatile four-week moving average fell by 2,250 to 350,500, good for the lowest reading since March 2008. A separate report showed that non-farm business sector labor productivity fell by a seasonally adjusted 2% in the fourth quarter, compared to expectations for a decline of 1.3%. The U.S. is the world’s largest oil consumer."

1652,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 04, 2013 11:05PM ET</span>","Forex - EUR/USD continues dropping amid Italy, Spain woes","Investing.com - The euro continued to falter against the dollar during Tuesday’s Asian session as traders in the region took their turn digesting a spate of glum news out of the euro zone released on Monday. In Asian trading Tuesday, EUR/USD slumped 0.14% to 1.3496. The pair was likely to find support at 1.3415, last Tuesday's low, and resistance at 1.3711, Thursday's high. EUR/USD plunged 0.79% during Monday’s U.S. session. One reason for the common currency’s ills is news out of Spain. Amind corruption allegations, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is facing calls for his resignation. Those headlines and others interrupted the euro’s recent ascent against the greenback. Elsewhere, Spanish employment data revealed that the number of unemployed people in January rose by 2.7%, or by 132,055, to 4.98 million, which gave the euro some support.Analysts were expecting the number to rise by 150,000. Spain, the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy, already has an unemployment rate north of 20%, giving it one of the highest rates of joblessness in the developed world.  Meanwhile, Italy did nothing to help the situation as bond yields there surged after former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi pledged to cut taxes and repay a reviled real estate tax if his countrymen give him his old job back. Left-of-center rival Pier Luigi Bersani countered those points by promising to spend EUR7.5 billion on public works projects if elected. Either option is seen as undoing the austerity measure imposed by Mario Monti’s government. Monti, who has decided to run for a second term, has shown signs of being open to tax concessions. Italy is the euro zone’s third-largest economy behind Germany and France. The headlines dragged EUR/JPY lower by 0.16% to 124.64 while EUR/AUD gained 0.24% to 1.2978. EUR/NZD added 0.07% to 1.6038."
