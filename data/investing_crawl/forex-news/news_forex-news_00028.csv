 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Cracks deepened in Asian
equities on Thursday, with markets set to post their worst daily
performance in more than five months, while the euro took a
breather from its recent rally as it neared key resistance
levels.	
 Stocks opened slightly lower after a 1 percent overnight
drop in the S&P 500 but quickly extended losses, weighed
down by sectors such as technology , materials
and energy shares.	
 Materials was hit by a selloff in commodities such as oil
, which added to its previous day's losses, and a 2.8
percent plunge in U.S. corn futures on Wednesday.	
 The MSCI index of Asia and Pacific shares excluding Japan
fell 1.3 percent, retreating further from a
two-month peak tested on Wednesday and set for its biggest daily
fall since mid-August 2010 as investors booked profits.	
 Japan's Nikkei , which has raced up 14 percent since
November, fell 1.1 percent after weaker-than-expected earnings
by key U.S. technology and banking firms and strong Chinese
growth data.	
 ""The sharp fall in tech shares on Wall Street is prompting
investors to take profits on chipmakers that have outperformed
the market in recent weeks,"" said Shoji Yoshigoe, a senior
investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities Co Ltd.	
 The euro faltered at around $1.3450 after extending
its rally to a two-month high overnight, but analysts said the
single currency's uptrend looked intact after recent hawkish
comments from European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet, solid bond auctions in Spain and Portugal and talk that
German officials were drafting contingency plans in case Greece
defaults on its debt. .	
 ""If we can trade through $1.3500 and hold that, I can see it
trading up to $1.3750,"" a trader for a European bank in Hong
Kong said. Such a rise could occur in the next month, he said.	
 Adding to investor caution, China reported annual gross
domestic product growth sped up to 9.8 percent in the fourth
quarter, beating market forecasts, while inflation slowed less
than expected, numbers which could prod Beijing into stepping up
its policy tightening campaign. .	
 But the impact was limited as the key figures had already
been leaked on Wednesday.	
 
 TIME TO CATCH UP	
 Emerging market (EM) equities have been the laggards so far
in 2011 with the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index up just 0.3 percent so
far this year compared to MSCI U.S. index , which
was up 2 percent at the close of Wednesday.	
 A combination of investor fatigue after record performances
in 2010 along with rising inflationary pressures, particularly
in Indonesia and India, have prompted investors to rotate funds
out of emerging markets and into developed markets (DM).	
 Foreigners were net buyers of Japanese equities last week
for the 11th straight week, with buying at a 9-month high, data
showed, but market players said the trend could be nearing its
end after the Nikkei's sharp run-up in recent months.	
 Both Poland and Brazil delivered interest rate hikes this
week with India expected to follow with another quarter point
rate increase next week.	
 While inflows into emerging market equity funds extended
their streak to eight consecutive weeks, the amount they took in
was a third of the weekly average for 2010, EPFR data showed.	
 ""Tighter monetary policy is typically negative for equity
markets at the outset, but we believe this will eventually be
offset in EM by the positive effect of rising U.S. equity
markets as well as strong EM growth prospects,"" Brown Brothers
Harriman strategists said.	
 ""As such, we look for EM equities to play some catch up
ahead and outperform DM.""

 NEW YORK, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The euro rose to an eight-week
high on Wednesday on increasing optimism that Europe can defuse
its debt crisis, but equities fell on poor U.S. housing data
and bank earnings, while a rally in commodities faded.
 Traders said Asian sovereigns were again big buyers of the
euro, forcing enough short-covering to help it outperform the
U.S. dollar for the seventh session in the last eight. For

 The euro climbed more than 1 percent to hit a session high
of $1.3538 after slumping last week to a four-month low of less
than $1.30 on worries that a debt crisis that had engulfed
Greece and Ireland in 2010 would spread.
 But solid bond auctions in Spain and Portugal have boosted
spirits and talk that German officials were drafting
contingency plans in case Greece defaults suggested they were
working to prevent a deeper crisis. [ID:nLDE70I158]
 ""There is a growing sense of optimism that European leaders

foreign exchange strategy at BNY Mellon in Boston.

has pushed the benchmark index up nearly 10 percent since the

primed for a pullback.
 ""Even stocks here that are beating expectations are not

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The euro hit an eight-week
high above $1.35 on Wednesday, boosted by increased confidence
in Europe's ability to defuse its debt crisis, and could extend
gains if it holds ground above important technical levels.
 Traders said Asian sovereigns were again big euro buyers,
and that forced enough short-covering to help it outperform the
dollar for the seventh session in the last eight.

 But the focus remained the euro, which hit a four-month
low beneath $1.30 last week as markets worried that a debt
crisis that claimed Greece and Ireland would spread.
 Solid bond auctions in Spain and Portugal have boosted
spirits, however, and talk that German officials were drafting
contingency plans in case Greece defaults suggested they were

 ""There is a growing sense of optimism that European leaders
are finally getting their act together and working in a unified
manner,"" said Samarjit Shankar, managing director of global
foreign exchange strategy at BNY Mellon in Boston.
 Shankar said net buying among major currencies Wednesday
was strongest in the euro and said momentum could make a run
toward $1.36-37 possible in coming sessions.
 But Citigroup chief technical strategist Tom Fitzpatrick
said a run at its next upside target of $1.3571,the 50 percent
retracement of its November-to-January slide, would probably
require the currency to close above $1.35 on Wednesday.
 After hitting an eight-week high of $1.3538 overnight, the
euro retreated to $1.3466 by afternoon in New York, still up
0.7 percent.
 The dollar fell 0.7 percent to 82.04 yen , with BNY
Mellon citing renewed Japanese equities inflows helping the
currency, and shed 0.9 percent to 0.9553 Swiss francs .
 Comments from the European Central Bank last week, which
highlighted near-term inflation pressures, have also helped the
euro by sparking talk of an earlier-than-forecast rate rise.
 Euribor rates rose further, reflecting higher interest rate
expectations. [ID:nLDE70I0US]
 SOME UNCERTAINTY REMAINS
 The euro pared gains against the dollar after IFR reported

be able to repay its foreign debts.[ID:nIFRcdcM7P]
 It also slipped after EU Economic and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner Ollie Rehn said increasing the 440-euro limit of a
euro zone rescue fund was not a priority and that the fund's
efficiency needed work. [ID:nHEL009988]
 Despite recent euro gains, ""we could still relapse toward
$1.30 by the end of the quarter,"" Shankar said. ""Right now,
portfolio managers are testing the waters.""
 Among the euro buyers have been sovereign accounts, traders
said. Also, Russia joined China and Japan this week in
expressing interest in bonds from the European rescue fund.
 China has said it wants to move away from a global system
dominated by the dollar. If it were to let the yuan to rise
more rapidly against the U.S. currency, it would not need to
buy as many U.S. Treasuries, which could put upward pressure on
U.S. yields. China is the largest foreign U.S. creditor.

 ""I think the framework that is useful for analyzing what's
going on with the yuan is one where China pursues a strategy of
gradual appreciation and the U.S. uses these political events
to increase the pressure slightly,"" said Jens Nordvig, global
head of G10 strategy at Nomura Securities International.
 The yuan is up some 3.7 percent against the dollar since
mid-2010.

 * Hu ignores yuan, stresses G20, global uncertainty
 * Obama: yuan just one part of the U.S.-China ""problem""
 By Alister Bull
 WASHINGTON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Chinese President Hu Jintao
gave no clues on Wednesday about the future of the yuan,
ignoring the hot-button topic during a press conference at
which U.S. President Barack Obama pressed him to let the yuan
rise.
 Obama spoke quite bluntly, given the delicate diplomatic
setting, and said the yuan was still undervalued, despite being
allowed to edge up against the dollar in recent months.
 Obama also said Hu had indicated a desire to move toward a
market-based exchange rate system, and the United States was
confident he would achieve this goal.
 Hu pointedly did not comment at all on the yuan, much less
on Obama's characterization of his currency plans. He listened
impassively to a translation of Obama's remarks and when he
spoke, chose instead to emphasize the role of the Group of 20
in tackling financial matters, while noting the global economy
was slowly recovering but still faced uncertainty.
 G20, CRISIS -- CODED REBUKE?
 Hu's remarks deftly draw attention to a financial crisis
that began in the United States and delivered a subtle rebuke
to Washington for presuming to lecture China about the global
economy.
 In highlighting the G20, Hu indicated Washington had less
leverage with Beijing. China, together with Germany, are
reckoned by analysts to have done a good job in beating back
Washington's push for aggressive targets on balancing global
trade during a November summit of G20 leaders in Seoul.
 WILL THE YUAN RISE FASTER?
 No way to tell from this news conference. The only thing
that matters is what happens in the coming months.
 Besides, expectations had always been low for a big Chinese
announcement on the currency, given significant obstacles back
in China for any change that will hit the competitiveness
of an export industry that employs millions of Chinese.
 Obama said during the press conference that Hu had voiced
exactly this concern about the impact of an excessively rapid
yuan rise.
 In addition, even if Hu wants to allow the yuan to rise
faster, he can hardly been seen to bow to U.S. pressure while
being hosted by Obama at a state visit to the United States.
 ANY SURPRISES?
 Not really. Hu had been expected to stick to his bland,
vague talking points and did so with much discipline.
 Obama might have been more outspoken on the yuan than
anticipated in such proximity to the Chinese leader, but the
remarks go no further than those of his ministers in the days
before the visit.
 Obama also acknowledged the currency was just one part of
the economic issues facing China and the United States,
effectively playing down the yuan issue somewhat alongside
concerns over the theft of intellectual property rights and
market access.

 BIRMINGHAM, England, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Central banks' aim
is not always to lower inflation, but instead to ensure price
stability, Bank of England policymaker Adam Posen said on
Wednesday.
 Posen had been speaking about European monetary union at
Aston University in central England and an audience member
asked him about the claim that major central banks'
quantitative easing since the financial crisis had triggered
inflation.
 ""Central banks' job is not to lower inflation,"" he said.
""Their goal is price stability, not low inflation per se. They
are not the same thing because in practice you need inflation a
little above the zero measure to keep there from being a lot of
lock-ups in the economy.""
 The BoE has a target of inflation of 2 percent, and the BoE
justified its own programme of quantitative easing with the
risk of an inflation undershoot due to the spare capacity
created by Britain's deepest recession since World War Two.
 Posen has been the sole member of the BoE's Monetary Policy
Committee to advocate more QE in recent months, voting for a 50
billion pound ($79.91 billion) increase to 250 billion pounds
in October, November and December.
 Minutes of January's MPC meeting to be published next
Wednesday will show whether he maintained this stance at a time
when inflation reached an 8-month high of 3.7 percent.
 In his speech, Posen said that monetary union had succeeded
in bringing more stable prices to the 17 countries of the euro
zone, but had had little clear success in harmonising business
cycles, boosting trade or changing countries' fiscal habits.
 ""You cannot force changes on unwilling societies simply by
monetary fiat. That's more than monetary policy, even with the
strongest price stability commitment, is capable of
delivering,"" he said.
 Posen said he did not see any realistic chance that the
euro zone would break up, but warned that differences between
member states were likely to prove extremely persistent, as had
differences between the states of the United States.
 In the question and answer session, Posen also reiterated
his view that China's over-weak yuan currency -- rather than
U.S. monetary policy -- was to blame for the emerging economy's
inflation problem.

 WASHINGTON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama
said he told visiting Chinese President Hu Jintao on Wednesday
that China's currency is undervalued and should be increasingly
driven by markets.
 Obama used his opening statement at a joint news conference
to address one of the major disputes between the two countries
-- Washington's contention that China's yuan is not fairly
valued and is hurting the U.S. economy as a result.
 Obama returned to the topic later in response to a question
from a reporter.
 ""I told President Hu that we welcome China's increasing the
flexibility of its currency. But I also had to say that the
renminbi (yuan) remains undervalued, that there needs to be
further adjustment in the exchange rate,"" he said.
 Obama said he told Hu that changing the yuan policy ""can be
a powerful tool for China boosting domestic demand and
lessening the inflationary pressures in their economy.""
 ""So we'll continue to look for the value of China's
currency to be increasingly driven by the market, which will
help ensure that no nation has an undue economic advantage,"" he
said.
 But Obama said later that the currency was just part of the
broader U.S.-China economic relationship.
 ""The currency is a part of the problem. The renminbi is
undervalued. The Chinese government has intervened very
forcefully in the currency markets,"" Obama said, calling that
an indication the yuan is undervalued.
 He acknowledged Hu's concern about disruption in the export
market from overly rapid currency movements but said he was
confident of progress toward a market-based yuan.
 Hu said the two leaders discussed disagreements on economic
issues and trade.

 BARACK OBAMA ON 'A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD' FOR U.S. COMPANIES
 ""I did also stress to President Hu that there has to be a
level playing field for American companies competing in China.
The trade has to be fair. So I welcomed his commitment that
American companies will not be discriminated against when they
compete for Chinese government procurement contracts and I
appreciate his willingness to take new steps to combat the

 OBAMA ON CLIMATE CHANGE
 ""As the two largest energy consumers and emitters of
greenhouse gases, the United States and China have a
responsibility to combat climate change by building on the
progress in Copenhagen and Cancun, and showing the way to a
clean energy future. The president indicated that he agrees
with me on this issue.""
 OBAMA ON RIGHTS
 ""China has a different political system than we do. We come
from very different cultures and with very different histories.
But as I've said before and I repeated to President Hu, we have
some core views as Americans about the universality of certain
rights -- freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of
assembly -- that we think are very important and that transcend
cultures.""
 ""I have been very candid with President Hu about these
issues. Occasionally they are a source of tension between our
two governments. But what I've believed is the same thing that
seven previous presidents have believed, which is that we can
engage and discuss these issues in a frank and candid way,
focus on those areas where we agree while acknowledging that
there are going to be areas where we disagree.""
 OBAMA ON CHINA'S ECONOMIC RISE
""We also think that China's rise offers enormous economic
opportunity. We want to sell you all kinds of stuff. We want to
sell you planes, we want to sell you cars, we want to sell you
software and as President Hu and his government refocuses the
economy on expanding domestic demand, that offers opportunity
for U.S. businesses, which ultimately translates into U.S.
jobs.
 HU JINTAO ON SECURITY IN ASIA
 ""We agreed to strengthen consultation and coordination on
major issues that concern peace and development in the Asia
Pacific region and in the world. China and the United States
will enhance coordination and cooperation and work with the
relevant parties to maintain peace and stability on the
(Korean) peninsula, promote denuclearization of the peninsula
and achieve lasting peace and security in Northeast Asia.""
 HU ON GLOBAL CHALLENGES
 ""We will work with the United States and other countries to
effectively address global challenges such as meeting the
climate challenge, terrorism, transnational crime, energy and
resource security, food security, public health security and
serious national disasters.""
 OBAMA ON ECONOMIC REFORM
 ""We discussed China's progress in moving toward a more
market-oriented economy and how we could ensure a strong and
balanced global economic recovery. We agreed that in China this
means boosting domestic demand. In the United States it means
spending less and exporting more.
 OBAMA ON CURRENCY
 ""I told President Hu that we welcome China's increasing the
flexibility of its currency. But I also had to say that the
renminbi remains undervalued, that there needs to be further
adjustment in the exchange rate and that this can be a powerful
tool for China boosting domestic demand and lessening the
inflationary pressures in their economy. So we'll continue to
look for the value of China's currency to be increasingly
driven by the market, which will help ensure that no nation has
an undue economic advantage.""
OBAMA ON ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP
 ""In other areas, we'll compete, a healthy competition that
spurs both countries to innovate and become even more
competitive. That's the kind of relationship I see for the

technical level. Comments on Greece's debt woes caused it to
briefly fall below this threshold in New York trade.
 German government economic adviser Lars Feld was quoted
saying Greece will not be able to repay its international debts
in full and Germany must set aside funds for that eventuality,
IFR Markets reported.
 The euro, shared by 17 countries, climbed more than 1
percent to hit an eight-week high of $1.3538, according to
Reuters data and last traded at $1.3484.
 Officials in Germany's finance ministry are working on
contingency plans to handle fallout in case Greece defaults or
needs to restructure its debt, sources with direct knowledge of
the matter said.
 ""The risk aversion fears that drove so much of EUR/USD
selling over the past few months have eased considerably as
periphery economies have been able to stage a series of
successful auctions over the past two weeks,"" said Boris
Schlossberg, director of currency research at GFT in New York.
 Hopes policymakers would prevent the spread of a debt
crisis that has engulfed Greece and Ireland caused the euro to
outperform the dollar in seven of the past eight trading
sessions, with gains at about 0.80 percent so far this year.
 ""People are very impressed with the determination of
European officials and are expecting them to successfully deal
with the sovereign debt crisis,"" said Steven Englander, head of
G10 strategy at CitiFX in New York.
 ""The ramped-up rhetoric is having an impact, but that tends
to be temporary. So at some point in the first quarter,
investors are going to be looking to see if this determination
translates into concrete action,"" he added.
 Front-end euro/dollar volatility has remained subdued in
the last few days, settling between the 12.0 percent to 13.0
percent range.
 On Wednesday, one-month volatility on the currency pair
traded at 12.55 percent, sliding from as high as 14.0 percent
at the beginning of the year.
 Current levels suggested options investors have become less
nervous about the debt crisis and do not expect any major
hiccup in the region over the next 30 days.
 For a second straight day traders also cited significant
covering of bearish euro/dollar trade structures and strong
interest to sell euro/dollar volatility.
 Comments from the European Central Bank last week, which
highlighted near-term inflation pressures, have sparked talk of
an earlier-than-forecast rate rise.
 Euribor rates rose further, reflecting higher interest rate
expectations.
 Tom Fitzpatrick, head of technical analysis at CitifX in
New York, said a close above $1.35 would indicate further
upside for the euro over the next couple of weeks.
 The euro's next upside target lies at $1.3571, the 50
percent retracement of its November to January slide. The
euro's gains have helped push the dollar index to an eight-week
low of 78.334, down 0.7 percent. It last traded at 78.543.
 Despite the euro's gains, some analysts were concerned
European measures to tame the debt crisis were stalling and may
limit further euro gains.
Investors have been encouraged over the past couple of days,
however, as Russia joined China and Japan in expressing
interest in buying new bonds from the European Financial
Stability Facility rescue fund.
 The euro briefly rallied to a one-month high against the
Swiss franc of 1.2994 francs ahead of a press conference by the
Swiss government. Some traders speculated that officials may
try to talk down the Swiss currency.
 It retreated after the economics minister said he was
concerned about the currency's strength, while adding that
Swiss exporters were not yet in a crisis due to a strong
franc.

 NEW YORK, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The euro rose to an eight-week
high on Wednesday on increasing optimism about containing the
debt crisis in Europe, but sour U.S. housing data took the
steam out of a commodity rally and weighed on equity prices.
 The euro climbed more 1 percent to hit $1.3538, according
to Reuters data, helped by Asian sovereign buying and continued
short-covering. For details see [ID:nN19220726]
 The euro could extend gains in coming weeks as hope builds
that policymakers will control a smoldering debt crisis that
engulfed Greece and Ireland in 2010.
 ""People are very impressed with the determination of
European officials and are expecting them to successfully deal
with the sovereign debt crisis,"" said Steven Englander, head of
G10 strategy at CitiFX in New York.
 German newspaper Die Zeit, citing government sources,
reported Berlin is considering a plan to allow Greece to buy
back its own debt using euro zone crisis funds. Some investors
saw that report as a possible step forward in efforts to quell
the debt crisis. [ID:nLDE70I158]
 Also helping the euro was news that Germany raised its 2011
growth forecast by half a percentage point to 2.3 percent.
Officials said the recovery in Europe's powerhouse will broaden
and that previously sluggish domestic demand will pick up.
[ID:nLDE70I0F8]
 World equities rose to their highest in nearly 2-1/2 years,
but later erased gains after a drop in quarterly profit at
Goldman Sachs  deflated some of the optimism about
corporate results following Apple's  strong report on
Tuesday.
 MSCI's all-country world index for stocks <.MIWD00000PUS>
fell 0.2 percent, paring gains that had lifted the index
earlier in the session to highs last seen in August 2008.
 European shares ended lower after hitting 28-month highs,
as Goldman's disappointing results and a fall in U.S. housing
starts hurt sentiment and led some investors to take profits.
[ID:nLDE70I1YP]
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
finished 1.3 percent lower at 1,152.48 points.
 The trend is higher as earnings will be favorable, profit
margins are high and demand is improving, said Klaus Wiener,
chief economist at Generali Investments in Cologne, Germany.
 ""This is just a blip in the market, which is otherwise
drifting higher. What we are seeing now is some profit taking

 ""Expectations were for some better results after a fairly
robust fourth quarter and start to 2011,"" said Thomas Villalta,

 While Villalta said he is still bullish on financials for
2011, data from Thomson Reuters StarMine last week suggested
most banks would miss earnings expectations.
 Oil prices reversed earlier gains after stocks declined and
the weak U.S. housing data outweighed a softer dollar.
[ID:nL3E7CJ09E]
 U.S. crude oil prices  fell by 0.2 percent to $91.18
a barrel. ICE Brent futures  for March were better
supported, helped by North Sea oil outages, and managed to
rebound, up 59 cents to $98.39.
 Copper hit a record high on a weaker dollar and resilient

 By Martin Dokoupil and Mohamed Sudam
DUBAI/SANAA, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Impoverished Arab state
Yemen is struggling to keep its currency afloat as it ploughs
through cash reserves to fight rebellions, al Qaeda militancy
and crushing poverty in order to maintain social order.
 Yemen's central bank spent $1.6 billion last year --
equivalent to a quarter of its current reserves -- to lift the
rial from historic lows and help fund imports of basic goods.
 The bank's sub-governor told Reuters in Sanaa recently that
it would not allow further moves in the currency which it felt
were not, in its view, economically justified.
 Yet as Yemen edges closer to becoming a failed state,
analysts believe that it will be harder this year to keep its
currency stable in the face of declining confidence.
 And as authoritarian Arab leaders look anxiously at Tunisia,
where unrest fuelled by poverty has unseated a veteran autocrat,
gloomy economic news may be troubling to the administration of
President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who has ruled since the 1970s.
 ""There are possibilities of all kinds of emergencies that
may lead to additional pressure on the exchange rate,"" said
Abdul-Ghani al-Iryani, a political analyst in the capital.
 ""Given the fact that production of oil continues to slide,
sooner or later there will be another exchange rate crisis they
will have to deal with.""
 After tumbling 17 percent to a record low of 250 rials to
the dollar last year, policymakers determined to halt its slide
hiked the key interest rate to 20 percent from 12 percent in a
single move, sold dollars and capped currency outflows.
 That, plus higher oil prices, has helped the rial rate to
recover to around 214, easing imported inflation pressures.
 
 GRIP OF POVERTY
 Still, inflation in the Arab world's poorest country is
hovering at around 12 percent and unemployment at 35 percent.
And more than 40 percent of the 23 million Yemenis live on less
than $2 a day, making hunger a commonplace reality for many.
 Retailers in Sanaa price more expensive goods such as TV
sets in dollars to shield against sudden currency swings,
although payments in rials are accepted.
 The global rise in food prices is also a growing concern.
 ""In case the prices of food supplies continue to rise ...
this will lead to big risks to social peace and stability in the
country,"" said Abdul Karim Sallam, editor in chief of local
al-Ektisad al-Youm weekly.
 Widespread protests over soaring food prices and high
unemployment were instrumental in toppling Tunisia's ruler in
the past week and Algeria is witnessing similar protests. 
 Libya is cutting taxes on food, and Kuwait introduced
measures this week to subsidise food costs for its citizens.
 ""We had to increase prices repeatedly and customers turn
away as a result,"" said Ali Muhammad Nasser, a bakery shop owner
in Sanaa. ""Sometimes we don't achieve profits because we sell
with lower prices to encourage costumers to come.""
 
 SHALLOW RESERVES
 Yemen's government is being forced to spend more to prop up
the currency and the economy at a time when it needs to improve
its finances, depriving it of the firepower it would need to
avert another currency crisis.
 ""Even if oil prices go to $100 (a barrel), there is a
possibility that they will exhaust their foreign assets,"" said
John Sfakianakis, chief economist at Banque Saudi Fransi.
 ""Without any intervention, the currency may well go into a
downward spiral.""
 Ibrahim al-Nahari, the Yemeni central bank's sub-governor,
told Reuters that the central bank would not allow exchange rate
moves that were not economically justified and was coordinating
with the finance ministry to tackle the budget gap.
 Yemen's foreign currency reserves stood officially at $5.9
billion last month, down from $7.1 billion at end-2009, he said,
but some analysts disputed the figure, saying it may be much
lower.
 Lacking access to international debt markets, the state has
few options to plug a $1.5 billion budget hole other than to
borrow from the central bank or to raise funds from donors.
 The government, which relies on oil proceeds for 60 percent
of its income, plans to sell $500 million worth of Islamic bonds
this year but few believe that the issue can succeed.
 Only a fraction of $4.7 billion promised at a donor
conference in 2006 has been disbursed so far.
 Moreover, the IMF, which expects a budget shortfall of 5.0
percent of GDP this year, has said it is not considering new
loans for Yemen after a $370 million loan approved in August.
 As part of economic reforms, Yemen has begun reducing fuel
subsidies, a major burden on state finances, but is having to do
this gradually to avoid stoking public anger. Previous moves to
raise fuel prices provoked riots.
 But the government's commitment to improving finances
remains in question after it announced this week that would cut
income taxes for its employees to 15 percent from 20 percent.
 Caught between spending to keep citizens happy and the need
to conserve cash, Yemen has its hands tied.
 ""The Yemeni currency is in a very fragile situation,"" said
Mohamed al-Maytami, economics professor at Sanaa University.
 ""Looking at the central bank reserves and the budget deficit
I do not know how long they will be able to withstand new
currency weakness.""

 * Germany examines change to bond coupon or haircut scenario
 * Finance Ministry starts analysis, no conclusions reached
 * Greece, Germany deny any intention to restructure

(Adds detail on movement in Greek credit default swaps)
 By John O'Donnell
 BRUSSELS, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Officials in Germany's finance
ministry are working on contingency plans to handle the fallout
in case Greece defaults or needs to restructure its debt,
sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
 One source close to the finance ministry said German civil
servants were analysing how a Greek restructuring might work, as
well as what this would mean for German banks and the stability
of the euro zone. No conclusions have yet been reached.
 ""They have started to consider the unthinkable,"" said the
source. ""They are looking at a contingency plan preparing for
Greek restructuring.
 ""It is not something they want, but something they
recognise,"" he said. ""They would be unprepared for the impact on
their own bank balance sheets. They have started to see what the
Greek constitution says.""
 German newspaper Die Zeit, citing government sources,
reported Berlin is considering a plan to allow Greece to buy
back its own debt using euro zone crisis funds.
 Some investors saw that report as a possible new step
forward in Europe's efforts to quell the debt crisis, and the
idea of a shift of Greece's debt out of private hands and onto
EU governments buoyed markets, reducing the relative cost of
borrowing for Italy, Spain and Portugal. 
 But Greece and Germany denied preparing for any
restructuring of Greek debt. 
 ""There is no discussion on the issue of restructuring,""
Greek Deputy Finance Minister Philippos Sachinidis told Reuters.
 A German finance ministry spokesman said in a statement:
""Germany is not preparing a restructuring of Greek debt.""
 Publicly, Germany remains opposed to any restructuring or
partial non-payment of Greek debt, but some officials in Berlin
are increasingly concerned that it may be inevitable.
 The sources told Reuters that one of the outcomes being
examined is that the maturity or life of Greek bonds would be
extended, together with a cut in the coupon or interest rate --
measures that would substantially reduce the value of the debt.
 As an incentive to investors, EU countries could offer
guarantees to bondholders to reassure them of the security of
their Greek debt. Another scenario being examined is a
straightforward cut to the face value of the bond.
 ""They are still thinking of a voluntary exchange,"" said the
source.
 
 BALANCING ACT
 A second, German source linked to the country's financial
policymaking, said officials were weighing the possibility of a
default on Greek debt.
 ""They are in the course of looking at scenarios -- one is
that they must restructure. And for Ireland too,"" he said.
 ""It is a balancing act. It is economically necessary. It is
not politically opportune to do it overtly. You cannot
restructure Greek bonds and do nothing for Ireland. Officially,
no one is speaking, but it is an ongoing issue.""
 German banks have the second-highest exposure to Greek debt
-- almost 37 billion euros -- and the highest to Ireland of more
than 138 billion euros, but many banks have shifted many of
these loans onto the so-called bank book, where writedowns would
not be immediate.
""Everyone knows that Greece has never been in a position to
... fulfil their obligations, whatever the interest rate,"" said
one senior German banker.
 ""The question is the right timing (of restructuring). The
banks have had time to prepare well. That goes for Hypo Real
Estate, WestLB or any other landesbank.""
 Many in the markets expect that Greece's debt, which is set
to peak at 157 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) in
2013, may be too high for the country to repay entirely.
 The price of credit default swaps on Greek bonds, used to
insure against the risk of default, puts the chances of Athens
defaulting at 30 percent over the next two years.
 ""The market is pricing in a significant probability of a
default or a restructuring and looking at the change in Greek
spreads today -- 2-years underperforming Germany and 30-years
outperforming -- implies near term uncertainty has increased,""
said Credit Agricole rate strategist Peter Chatwell.
 Despite street protests and strikes, the government in
Athens is sticking to its austerity drive and insists there will
be no restructuring of its debt, although Deputy Prime Minister
Theodoros Pangalos has said this could help Greece.

 (Adds details, quotes, background, share price)
 By Teis Jensen
 COPENHAGEN, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Danisco's chairman
reaffirmed support on Wednesday for chemicals group DuPont's
bid for the food ingredients and enzymes maker in what appeared
to be his first public response to reports of a looming
shareholder revolt.
 Chairman Jorgen Tandrup's remarks in an emailed statement
came in answer to questions from Reuters about a Danish
newspaper report that said some institutional investors were
teaming up to seek a higher bid or block the takeover.
""The offer from DuPont represents a fair value for the
company,"" Tandrup said.
 U.S. chemicals giant DuPont announced on Jan. 9 that it
would pay $5.8 billion in cash or 665 crowns per share and
assume $500 million in Danisco debt to acquire the Danish
company with backing from Danisco's board.
 Danisco shares wobbled off highs for the day after Tandrup's
comments to trade nearly flat, before edging back up 0.2 percent
at 662 crowns by 1525 GMT.
 Tandrup said at the time of the bid that DuPont's was the
best of several offers and gave shareholders a 25 percent
premium over Danisco's all-time high share price set on the
trading day preceding the DuPont offer.
 But since then, media have reported that some Danisco
shareholders have been unsatisfied with the offer and are ready
to look for a better deal.
 ""It (the deal) was made after a very thorough process
involving a number of interested parties,"" Tandrup said in the
email. ""The offer maximises value for shareholders and the board
is totally satisfied that the process extracted the best
possible value for Danisco's shareholders.""
 ""The offer not only compares favourably with any stand-alone
strategy with all its execution risks but delivers a premium to
shareholders compared with the recent historic high prices of
Danisco's shares, and a 90 percent premium to the share price
only a year ago,"" he said on Wednesday.
 Earlier on Wednesday, Danish financial daily Borsen said
that ""a handful"" of big institutional investors who were not
impressed with the DuPont bid were talking to one another and
considering taking action against it.
 ""They want at least a higher bid, but are also considering
whether there is not a better case for letting Danisco continue
as an independent company and try to reap some of the
improvements in profitability that Danisco has promised its
shareholders,"" Borsen said, citing a source it did not identify.

33,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2011 10:56AM ET</span>",U.S. lawmakers urge Obama to press Hu on trade rules," WASHINGTON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - A group of 84 U.S. lawmakers
has urged President Barack Obama to tell his Chinese
counterpart, Hu Jintao, ""that America's patience is near an
end"" over China's failure to play by trade rules.
 ""We can no longer afford to tolerate China's disregard for
binding commitments they agreed to as a part of their accession
to the World Trade Organization,"" the group from the U.S. House
of Representatives said in a letter released on Wednesday.
 The group's letter threw a spotlight on one of the mostcontentious issues during Hu's four-day state visit to the
United States. Critics in the United States say China does not
play by the rules as it amasses economic power and maintains a
huge trade surplus with the United States.
 The lawmakers accused China of manipulating its currency to
give its exporters an unfair trade advantage, doling out
generous subsidies to help its domestic companies, restricting
rare earth exports to disadvantage foreign high-tech companies
and forcing U.S. and other Western companies to transfer
technology in order to do business in the Chinese market.
 ""The strong, bipartisan showing on this letter illustrates
that there is a broad base of support for the President
demanding action from China,"" said Representative Michael
Michaud, chairman of the House Trade Working Group.
 The letter, dated on Tuesday, was one in stream of missives
from lawmakers ahead of what some analysts have called the most
important U.S.-China summit in the past three decades.
 ""Ensuring that China abides by international trade laws is
imperative for the vitality of our nation's economy and for the
viability of American businesses. We believe that President Hu
should hear this message no uncertain terms,"" the letter said.

(Adds details, quotes)
 By Caren Bohan and Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The United States and China
on Wednesday agreed on $45 billion in U.S. export deals and to
give U.S. companies greater access to China's $88 billion-plus
government contracts market at the start of Chinese President
Hu Jintao's four-day state visit.
 White House officials said the agreements included China's
""final"" approval of a $19 billion contract to buy 200 Boeing
aircraft for delivery between 2011 and 2013.
 ""From machinery to software, from aviation to agriculture,
these deals will support some 235,000 American jobs -- and that
includes many manufacturing jobs,"" U.S. President Barack Obama
said at a joint press conference with Hu.
 The announcements served to underscore the theme of
economic cooperation struck by Hu and Obama. But the size of
the deals will do little to dent the huge bilateral trade
deficit the United States runs with China, estimated to be
running in 2010 at a record of $275 billion.
 Many of the orders had been in the works for a while, and
shares in the companies affected by the deals weakened on
Wednesday more steeply than the broader market.
 Another deal involving GE builds on an existing partnership
with the Chinese Ministry of Railways to bring Chinese
high-speed rail technology to the United States, and for GE to
manufacture locomotives for China.
 The White House also trumpeted deals in various stages of
development involving Honeywell, Caterpillar, Westinghouse
Electric, a unit of Japan's Toshiba Corp, and other companies.
 While the pacts are significant, Jeremie Waterman, director
for China at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said they also
""highlight how much the Chinese economy is directed by the
state,"" often to the detriment of U.S. companies.
 The U.S. Chamber has called forcefully for more opening of
the Chinese market to U.S. companies.
 GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS
 Perhaps more encouraging, Waterman said, was progress in
opening up the government contract market by addressing
""indigenous innovation"" policies that U.S. companies say would
require them to transfer technology to the Chinese.
 China agreed to ""delink its innovation policies from its
government procurement preferences,"" and also repeated a
promise not to discriminate against foreign goods or services
based on where their intellectual property content is developed
or maintained, the White House said in a fact sheet.
 ""That arguably is the most significant commercial
commitment, assuming it is implemented,"" Waterman said.
 The Chinese central government buys more than $88 billion
annually in goods and services, and provinces and
municipalities buy even more. U.S. companies such as GE have
complained of restrictions.
 ""The notion was if we're part of the Chinese economy, we
should be allowed to win,"" GE's CEO Jeffrey Immelt said in a
Reuters Insider Television interview after corporate executives
met with Hu and Obama at the White House.
 SOFTWARE
 Hu's visit coincides with rising U.S. criticism that China
does not play by the rules as it amasses economic power and
uses a number of policies to maintain a large trade surplus
with the United States.
 In the meeting with U.S. and Chinese business leaders, Hu
said he saw ""a promising future"" for U.S.-China trade and
pledged to maintain a ""transparent, just, fair, highly
efficient investment climate"" for foreign firms.
 Although China is one of the fastest-growing export markets
for the United States, that is overshadowed by imports from
China that reached an estimated $370 billion in 2010.
 The two leaders also discussed intellectual property rights
protection and Obama said China needed to make more progress to
stop piracy and counterfeiting of U.S. goods.
 Microsoft's CEO Steve Balmer, who attended the corporate
executives meeting, expressed disappointment that no new
software sales were announced. U.S. software manufacturers say
they lose billions of dollars in China each year because of
illegal copies.
 Although Obama touted software exports to China, ""we have
seen no evidence of increased sales in recent weeks or months,""
said Emery Simon of the Business Software Alliance, which
represents Microsoft and other U.S. companies.
 New software auditing procedures agreed between the two
countries also aren't tough enough to ensure China lives up to
its promise to increase use of legal product, Simon said.
 FAKERY
 Boeing, while crediting the U.S. government for helping to
seal the $19 billion deal, acknowledged the orders had been on
their books for a while.
 That prompted some criticism of Obama's announcement.
 ""This kind of fakery is an insult to the American people,
and especially to America's legions of unemployed,"" said Alan
Tonelson of the U.S. Business and Industry Council.
 A huge Chinese business delegation has accompanied Hu on
his trip to the United States, and will cap the week in Chicago
where more deals are expected to be announced.
 Chinese officials told the Obama administration that
Chinese companies had signed 70 contracts worth $25 billion in
U.S. exports from 12 states, U.S. officials said.
 Obama, who hopes to reduce high U.S. unemployment in part
by doubling exports in five years, at times acted as U.S.
salesman-in-chief during the press conference with Hu.
 ""We want to sell you all kinds of stuff,"" Obama said.
 But talks over the past two weeks aimed at reopening

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The euro rallied to an
eight-week high on Wednesday on growing expectations the debt
crisis in Europe is under control, while oil and other
commodity prices gained on further signs of global demand.
 World equities hit their highest in nearly 2-1/2 years, but
U.S. stocks eased in early trade after lower quarterly profit
at Goldman Sachs  deflated some of the optimism about
corporate results following Apple's  blow-out report.
 The euro climbed over 1 percent on the day to hit an
eight-week high of $1.3538, according to Reuters data, on
reported Asian sovereign buying and continued short-covering.
For details see:[ID:nN19220726]
 The euro could extend gains in the weeks ahead amid hope
policy-makers will stanch a debt crisis that has engulfed
Greece and Ireland.
 ""People are very impressed with the determination of
European officials and are expecting them to successfully deal
with the sovereign debt crisis,"" said Steven Englander, head of
G10 strategy at CitiFX in New York.
 The dollar weakened to eight-week lows, helping to lift
commodity prices, which also gained on rising global demand
prospects. Copper hit an all-time high and crude oil rose after
the International Energy Agency boosted its growth forecast.
 The IEA became the second major forecaster this week to
revise up its 2011 oil demand growth estimate on buoyant
economic growth, led by Asian countries.
 ICE Brent futures  rose 9 cents to $97.89 a barrel,
after earlier rising to $98.60.
 U.S. crude oil prices  slipped rose 74 cents to
$90.68 a barrel, after earlier rising to $92.10.
 The 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB> rose
to a 27-month high, helped by a rise in copper prices to a
record high. Benchmark copper  on the London Metal
Exchange hit a record at $9,781 a tonne.
 Spot gold prices  rose $2.46 to $1,369.70 an ounce.
 A weaker dollar, ongoing Asian buying and a broader
investor push into commodities bolstered gold prices.
 The dollar was down against a basket of major currencies,
with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> down 0.52 percent at 78.549.
 European stocks fell, as did major U.S. indexes except for
the Dow Industrials, but global shares rose. MSCI's all-country
world index <.MIWD00000PUS> pared some gains, but was still
ahead yb 0.1 percent
 A fall in banking shares helped push the broad S&P 500
index lower. The Select Sector Financial Select Sector SPDR
Fund  fell 1 percent.
 ""Banks had some difficulty with revenue as seen with
Goldman Sachs this morning,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief market
strategist at Banyan Partners LLC in New York.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 8.18 points,
or 0.07 percent, at 11,846.11. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> was down 4.31 points, or 0.33 percent, at 1,290.71. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 13.19 points, or 0.48
percent, at 2,752.66.
 U.S. Treasuries were modestly higher, as the market
struggled for direction in the absence of data that would
change the prevalent view of easy monetary policy and modest
economic growth. [ID:nN19353894]
 Heavy corporate supply has injected market volatility, as
dealers bought and sold Treasuries to hedge the yields on the
bonds they underwrite, analysts said.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note 
reversed course to trade up 5/32 in price, to yieldd 3.35
percent, after earlier trading lower.

 * 2,500 business and political leaders at Swiss resort
 * Davos meeting runs from Jan. 26 to Jan. 30
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The world is suffering from
""global burnout syndrome"" and is too weak to tackle the web of
interrelated threats facing businesses and governments, the head
of the World Economic Forum said on Wednesday.
 Klaus Schwab, who chairs the WEF that organises the annual
meeting of executives and politicians at Davos, said the world
had not yet fully digested the crisis that emerged from the
financial crunch, and was not yet in post-crisis phase.
 ""We have to be careful that this crisis does not become a
social crisis -- which it has in some countries,"" the German
business studies professor told a media conference on the
gathering at the Swiss resort from Jan. 26 to Jan. 30.
 ""We have in the world a situation where the political system
and the institutions are just overwhelmed by the complexity
which they have to face,"" he said.
 The Davos meeting, protected by beefed-up Swiss security
which includes the closing of local airspace, is the world's top
networking event, allowing bankers and CEOs to rub shoulders
with presidents and prime ministers, and to cut deals.
 But the uneven economic recovery makes it a particularly
challenging time to be meeting, with emerging economies
rebounding but rich countries still struggling.
 In the rich world social tension is rising as governments
bring in austerity measures to pay off debt or postpone hard
decisions on borrowing, while companies return to profitability
and banks resume controversial bonus payments.
 Global forecasting and analysis group IHS says a
restructuring of eurozone sovereign debt is inevitable and while
it is unlikely that fringe countries will drop out of the euro,
financial markets could force the next phase of crisis
management as early as this year.
 ""This will very likely include a debt restructuring plan,
with 'haircuts' for investors and further aid for the European
banks holding much of this debt,"" IHS Chief Economist Nariman
Behravesh said in a briefing for the Davos forum.
 
 COMBINATION OF RISK, FAILURE OF GOVERNANCE
 In a report last week, the WEF identified three interrelated
nexuses of risks -- economic, such as fiscal, trade and currency
problems; raw materials, particularly the impact of rising
energy costs and dwindling water supplies on food prices; and
illegal trade, corruption and failed states. [ID:nLDE70B1I1]
 ""It's not just risks in isolation, it's the combination of
risks that can be so dangerous,"" said WEF Chief Business Officer
Robert Greenhill.
 Rising economic disparity and social tension nationally and
the increasing inability of the global community to tackle
problems proactively exacerbates these threats.
 ""It's that failure of global governance... which is perhaps
the greatest risk of all,"" Greenhill said.
 Glitz and hype surround the meeting in Davos, an upmarket
ski resort made famous by German novelist Thomas Mann in his
novel ""The Magic Mountain"" written at a time when it was better
known for its sanitoriums for wealthy tuberculosis sufferers.
 But the organisers do not claim it can actually solve the
problems it discusses -- although anti-capitalist campaigners
denounce it as a plutocratic cabal plotting global domination.
 ""The World Economic Forum is not a decision-making body. It
fosters dialogue, it fosters understanding,"" Schwab said.
 But Greenhill said it will try to help with the complex of
threats by launching a ""global risk response network"" bringing
together company risk officers and government policy-makers.
 As usual the WEF will wheel out several global leaders among
its 2,500 participants. The chair of the G20, French President
Nicolas Sarkozy, addresses the forum on Thursday, Jan. 27.
 Among 25 government heads expected are German Chancellor
Angela Merkel and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who opens
the forum on Wednesday, Jan. 26. Medvedev, a keen user of the
micro-blogging site Twitter, will take questions from the public
via ""crowdsourcing"" on www.wef.ch/askdmitrimedvedev.
 The cast list also features eight central bankers, including
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet, who will
also take part in an open session accessible to the public, and
14 labour leaders and more than 1,400 CEOs and other business
chiefs -- 400 of whom will be using Twitter as ""CEO reporters"".
 Davos's reputation in the past was made by several
high-profile diplomatic meetings on the sidelines.
 This year, seven key trade ministers hosted by the European
Union will meet on Friday, Jan. 28, as part of renewed efforts
to conclude the nine-year-old Doha round to free up world trade
-- itself one of the biggest failures of global governance.

 * Economic and financial sanctions did not stop imports
 * Dubai-based Iranian businesses mull shifting to Turkey
 
 By Reza Derakhshi
 TEHRAN, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Although there were no lines of
eager customers forming outside computer stores in Tehran on the
day that Apple's iPad was introduced to the world last year, the
tablet computer -- the newest global must-have gadget -- has
quietly appeared in Iranian shops, despite tightened sanctions.
 On a recent winter's evening, the swank Paitakht Computer
Center in northern Tehran was packed with young,
technology-savvy Iranians looking for the latest digital
products for work or fun.
 And products made by Apple -- the technology giant from a
country that Iran labels as the ""Great Satan"" and that has led
the drive to isolate Iran economically - were attracting more
shoppers than anything else in the multistory electronics
emporium.
 ""It's so amazing that you can find the latest American-made
high-tech products with a cheap price in a country under heavy
U.S. sanctions,"" said Mahnoush Tavakkoli, one of the shoppers.
Tavakkoli, 36, had just purchased an iPad.
 In Tehran, the price of an iPad ranges from $680 to $1,100,
depending on the model. The minimum retail price for the latest
iPhone 4 is $880. Those prices are similar to what shoppers
would pay for similar goods in Britain, for example.
 Washington imposed a ban on most trade between the United
States and Iran as long ago as 1979, after the storming of the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran and the ensuing hostage drama.
 U.S. companies were barred from dealing with Iran,
particularly in oil and gas projects. Goods or services from
Iran, except for certain foodstuffs and carpets, cannot be
imported into the United States.
 Since 2006, Iran has come under tighter economic and
financial sanctions, imposed by the U.N. Security Council and
intended to curb a nuclear program that some countries maintain
is being used to develop atomic weapons, a charge that Iran
denies.
 
 U.S. GOOD IN DEMAND
 Washington and its European allies have followed up the U.N.
sanctions with their own measures aimed at making it more
difficult for Iran to gain access to international banking
services and hampering outside investments in its vital oil and
gas sectors.
 But all this has not stopped U.S.-branded goods from making
their way into the Iranian market.
 ""Global sanctions might have brought more limitations for
Iranian traders, but they have learned how to meet their needs,""
said Bahman, a shop owner selling Apple products who asked that
his surname not be used.
 Imported goods in Iran come mainly from Europe or Asia.
Still, in the digital field, it is relatively easy to find a
product made in the United States or under the license of a U.S.
company.
 ""We had iPad in Tehran less than a month after it hit the
global market,"" Bahman said. ""It was the same for other American
brands like Dell, Hewlett-Packard, BlackBerry or Motorola.""
 Like Apple's iPhones, BlackBerry smartphones, made by the
Canadian company Research In Motion, act as platforms for a
range of applications that cannot be obtained via Iran's tightly
controlled telecommunications networks. This limitation on their
functionality, however, has not reduced their appeal to
fashion-conscious Iranians seeking a high-tech status symbol.
 ""People in Iran have a desire to move along with the world
in using the latest electronic products -- even if some of
their new features do not work here,"" Bahman said.
 Some features of new digital products -- such as TweetDeck
in iPad for users of the Twitter social network, or Kindle,
which allows users to download e-books from the online retailer
Amazon -- do not work in Iran because of poor and restricted
Internet and telecommunication connectivity.
 While U.S. officials assert that it is sanctions that are
responsible for hampering the development of Iran's nuclear
program, the situation is different in the personal technology
sector.
 Retailers and consumers say that if anything is going to
slow the trade in electronic gadgets, it will not be sanctions
but rather Iranians' reduced spending power. And the blame for
that, they say, rests with domestic economic policies and not
international steps against Iran.
 
 UNAFFORDABLE LUXURIES
 The government started to cut back fuel and food subsidies
in December, aiming to save the state up to $100 billion a year
and to make Iran less vulnerable to any sanctions on fuel
imports.
 As the cost of essential goods rises, some Iranians fear
that they will no longer be able to splash out on luxuries --
especially if inflation, currently around 10 percent, soars, as
some economists predict.
 ""Sometimes I think we have more been suffering from our own
economic mismanagement than the imposed sanctions,"" said a
university professor in Tehran who asked not to be identified
because of the government's reputation for reacting harshly to
criticism.
 ""My children love digital gadgets, and I used to buy them
for them,"" he said. ""But as the living costs are sharply rising,
I should take more care about our basic needs.""
 Molaie, a manager of a company importing computer and
network equipment, who also did not want his full name used,
said that imports would continue as long as there was market
demand. ""It is just the matter of people's purchasing power.""
 ""We had no major obstacle so far in our businesses,"" he
added. ""I have no idea about the government's difficulties.""
 Much of the trade in sanctions-busting goods comes through
the United Arab Emirates and more particularly Dubai, which
faces Iran across the Gulf. Both legal shipments and smuggled
goods regularly cross the intervening stretch of water, which is
only 54 kilometers, or 29 miles, at its narrowest point at the
Strait of Hormuz.
 Dubai's close economic ties with Iran have attracted
scrutiny from Washington. In response to that, the UAE signaled
last year that it would rein back its longstanding role as a
trading and financial lifeline.
 In June, the UAE's central bank, in a measure that could
spell disaster for many Iranian banks and businesses that deal
with Dubai, told financial institutions to freeze accounts
belonging to dozens of firms and blacklisted dozens of entities.
 As a consequence, said Mojtaba Esfehanian, a manager of a
computer company in Tehran, many Iranian companies based in
Dubai had started to think of moving elsewhere.
 The 41-year-old manager said Turkey and Malaysia, with their
large Muslim populations, could act like bridges connecting Iran
to the markets in the West and the East.
 As the UAE pulls back from its traditional relationship,
""our neighbor Turkey seems more attractive for Iranians,""
Esfehanian said.
 Iran's ambassador to Turkey, Bahman Huseyinpur, recently
visited Turkey's Black Sea coast as part of a fact-finding
mission to assess the port facilities available there. The
reason: Tehran wanted ""to transfer a large portion of our trade
from the Gulf"" to Turkey, he said.

 * India's oil secretary sees a solution in next few days
 
 NEW DELHI/MUMBAI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Officials from India's
central bank head to Germany on Thursday for talks with its
counterpart the Bundesbank, oil industry sources said on
Wednesday, perhaps a last attempt to resolve a row between India
and Iran over oil payments.
 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said last month payments to
Iran could no longer be settled using a long-standing clearing
house system run by regional central banks.
 Since then, the two sides have struggled to find a solution.
 ""Nothing has moved forward ... we are back to where we were,
and left with no option. An RBI team will travel to Germany
tomorrow for talks with the Bundesbank,"" one source said.
 Another source, who was part of an Indian delegation to
Tehran this month, confirmed this.
 ""Iran suggested for payment through Bank of Sharjah and
National Bank of Dubai. But these two banks are not willing to
facilitate payments to Iran,"" the first source said.
 Iran earlier this month suggested Indian firms open an
account in the Iran-owned Frankfurt-based EIH bank for payments
for oil imports.
 ""Ministry of External Affairs said no to it. They have
advised against it,"" the first source said.
 The U.S. Treasury Department in September put sanctions on
EIH for facilitating billions of dollars of transactions with
Iranian banks that the United States and European Union have
blacklisted for aiding Iran's nuclear or missile programs.
 
 POLITICAL ISSUE
 Indian central bank officials consider the issue as more of
a political than a regulatory one and say it can be solved
diplomatically.
 ""It is more of a political issue of sanction and the stance
taken by some countries against Iran. A solution can be found
provided the Western world understands there are options
available within the sanction. We need to discuss that with
western regulators,"" said a source with direct knowledge of the
matter.
 India's Oil Secretary, S. Sundareshan, said earlier on
Wednesday a solution should come in the next few days.
 Indian banks have meanwhile been asked to exercise caution
and discretion while dealing with Iran, the source with direct
knowledge of the matter added.
 Iran is India's second biggest crude oil supplier after
Saudi Arabia, accounting for about 13 percent of its crude
imports.
 India imports 400,000 barrels of crude per day from Iran, a
trade worth roughly $12 billion per year.
 The Indian decision came within weeks of U.S. President
Barack Obama visiting New Delhi.
 Washington praised the move, saying it would reduce what it
sees is a misuse of funds by Iran to support its nuclear
activity, which the West suspects has military aims.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The euro rallied to an
eight-week high against the dollar on Wednesday on growing
hopes euro zone officials will navigate the sovereign debt
crisis, with further gains seen if key levels are sustained.
 The euro rose on reports of Asian sovereign buying and
continued short-covering, while traders pushed the single
currency above a key technical level.
 The euro, shared by 17 countries, climbed more than 1
percent to hit an eight-week high of $1.3538, according to
Reuters data and last traded at $1.3504.
 The euro could extend gains in the weeks ahead on hopes
that policymakers would prevent a debt crisis that has engulfed
Greece and Ireland from spreading.
 ""People are very impressed with the determination of
European officials and are expecting them to successfully deal
with the sovereign debt crisis,"" said Steven Englander, head of
G10 strategy at CitiFX in New York.
 ""The ramped-up rhetoric is having an impact, but that tends
to be temporary. So at some point in the first quarter,
investors are going to be looking to see if this determination
translates into concrete action,"" he added.
 Front-end euro/dollar volatility has remained subdued in
the last few days, settling between the 12.0 percent to 13.0
percent range.
 On Wednesday, one-month volatility on the currency pair
traded at 12.55 percent, sliding from as high as 14.0 percent
at the beginning of the year.
 Current levels suggested options investors have become less
nervous about the debt crisis and do not expect any major
hiccup in the region over the next 30 days.
 For a second straight day traders also cited significant
covering of bearish euro/dollar trade structures and strong
interest to sell euro/dollar volatility.
 The euro brushed off a German newspaper report that the
government was considering a plan to allow Greece to buy back
its own debt using a euro zone crisis fund. Athens and Berlin
denied the report.
 The currency was supported as the German government raised
its forecast for 2011 economic growth Wednesday following a
strong reading of economic sentiment the previous day.
 Comments from the European Central Bank last week, which
highlighted near-term inflation pressures, have sparked talk of
an earlier-than-forecast rate rise.
 Euribor rates rose further, reflecting higher interest rate
expectations.
 Tom Fitzpatrick, head of technical analysis at CitifX in
New York, said a close above $1.35 would indicate further
upside for the euro over the next couple of weeks.
 The euro's next upside target lies at $1.3571, the 50
percent retracement of its November to January slide. The
euro's gains have helped push the dollar index to an eight-week
low of 78.334, down 0.7 percent. It last traded at 78.442.
 Despite the euro's gains, some analysts were concerned that
European measures to tame the debt crisis were stalling and may
limit further euro gains.
 ""There was some optimism that the euro zone structural
problems were on the way to being sorted, but there may have
been a bit of a reassessment of that,"" said Jeremy Stretch,
currency strategist at CIBC.
 Investors have been encouraged over the past couple of
days, however, as Russia joined China and Japan in expressing
interest in buying new bonds from the European Financial
Stability Facility rescue fund.
 The euro briefly rallied to a one-month high against the
Swiss franc of 1.2994 francs ahead of a press conference by the
Swiss government. Some traders speculated that officials may
try to talk down the Swiss currency.
 It retreated after the economics minister said he was
concerned about the currency's strength, while adding that
Swiss exporters were not yet in a crisis due to a strong franc.

 * Cocoa trade says not affected for now
 * Europe's own interests could prevent tougher action
 
 By Ange Aboa and Jonathan Saul
 ABIDJAN/LONDON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The Ivory Coast cocoa
trade is carrying on business as usual regardless of European
Union sanctions intended to pressure incumbent Laurent Gbagbo to
quit, and any tougher action is not on the cards for now.
 In the latest international effort to squeeze Gbagbo out of
power after a Nov. 28 presidential election he is widely seen to
have lost, EU governments on Saturday extended a freeze on
Ivorian assets and funding to the top cocoa grower's main ports.
 But while Brussels-based drafters of the measures style them
as prohibiting European firms from conducting any new business
with the ports, the cocoa trade itself has other ideas.
 ""Everyone is interpreting them as they wish, so we are
carrying on as normal,"" said the head of an international
exporter in Abidjan, who declined to be named.
 The story is the same in the western port of San Pedro.
 ""At the moment I am loading cocoa for Amsterdam and Antwerp
and I've got another ship due this month to take cocoa to
eastern Europe. No one has told me of a problem and the shipper
hasn't changed his schedule,"" said an exporter based there.
 Ivory Coast supplies over a third of the world's cocoa and
-- despite fears the election dispute could tip it back into
civil war -- is having a pretty good season so far.
 Around 744,000 tonnes reached Abidjan and San Pedro by the
end of last week, according to exporters' estimates seen by
Reuters, up nearly 20,000 tonnes on the same point last year.
 Successfully depriving Gbagbo of cocoa taxes worth around $1
billion a year would leave him short of cash to pay $160 million
a month of public sector and army salaries, potentially
precipitating a fall from power.
 
 EUROPEAN FIRMS HURT?
 According to the text of the measures published in the EU's
Official Journal at the weekend, 11 Ivorian institutions
including the ports, cocoa body CGFCC, three banks and the state
broadcaster will have their EU-held assets frozen and any future
funding from within the bloc cut off. 
 ""The basic rule is that you cannot make available economic
resources, so you cannot pay for instance a designated entity,""
said a European Commission foreign policy official who declined
to be named.
 ""So that would essentially result in a prohibition to do
business with those entities,"" the official concluded.
 Not so, says Abidjan port director Marcel Gossio, who argues
that the only victims will be European firms who have carried
out work for the port and could now end up unpaid.
 ""So they are freezing the accounts of Abidjan port held in
their countries, but those are there to pay European
contractors. So I won't pay them and that's that -- it's not my
doing; it is the doing of their governments,"" he told Reuters.
 So far, cocoa futures markets have shrugged off the
sanctions, even easing slightly on Monday, the first working day
after their publication. 
 
 NO APPETITE SEEN FOR TOUGHER MOVES
 Several local exporters said they were reserving judgment on
the measures, while their headquarters went over the fine print
with lawyers.
 A Brussels-based lawyer representing commodity traders was
advising clients to ""hold their horses"" and not trade for the
moment until the impact of the measures becomes clear.
 One derogation from the freeze authorises the flow of funds
to bodies on the list if they are covered by a prior ""judicial,
administrative or arbitral lien"".
 That could be interpreted as meaning there is no direct
consequence for Abidjan port operator Bollore of France, whose
existing contract with the port runs to 2019 and which is
responsible for dealings over container traffic.
 ""The general consensus is that the EU sanctions will have
little impact simply because the current focus and structure of
the sanctions is too narrow,"" said Hanna-Caroline Imig, risk
consultant with security firm AKE Ltd, noting that few of the
vessels calling into Ivory Coast were EU-flagged anyhow.
 African security adviser J. Peter Pham said if the EU were
serious about hurting Gbagbo, it would be studying an all-out
trade embargo. But he forecast there was little appetite for a
move that could hit its own cocoa and chocolate industry, and
mean near-starvation for 700,000 small subsistence farmers.
 ""No one should hold his or her breath waiting for coherence
between political rhetoric and action driven by realpolitik,""
Pham commented.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The euro rallied to an eight-week
high against the dollar on Wednesday on reported Asian sovereign
buying and continued short-covering, while traders succeeded in
pushing the single currency above a key technical level.
 The shared currency climbed 1 percent on the day to hit an
eight-week high of $1.3525 according to Reuters data, shaking
off concerns that European policymakers were making slow
progress in tackling the euro zone debt crisis.
 The euro brushed off a German newspaper report that the
Berlin government was considering a plan allowing Greece to buy
back its own debt using a euro zone crisis fund. Athens and
Berlin have denied the report.
 ""There is a danger of a spike higher in the euro here

 Traders earlier reported euro buying by Middle and Far East
accounts to take it above an options barrier said to be at
$1.3500.
 That was around its mid-December peak, which had been acting
as key resistance. The single currency also broke above its
weekly ichimoku cloud, a technical indicator of support and
resistance levels, at $1.3510.
 The euro's next upside target lies at $1.3571, the 50
percent retracement of its November to January slide.
 Implied volatility in euro/dollar rose in short-dated tenors
in tandem with the euro's climb, suggesting trade may become
slightly more erratic in the near term. 
 The euro's gains helped push the dollar index to an
eight-week low of 78.334, down 0.7 percent on the day.
 
 SOVEREIGN DEBT
 Despite the euro's gains, some analysts remained concerned
that European measures to tame the euro zone debt crisis are
stalling, which may limit further gains in the euro. 
 ""There was some optimism that the euro zone structural
problems were on the way to being sorted, but there may have
been a bit of a reassessment of that,"" said Jeremy Stretch,
currency strategist at CIBC.
 The Dutch finance minister said on Tuesday the Eurogroup had
rejected enlarging a rescue fund for the region's more indebted
states.
 Investors have been encouraged over the past couple of days,
however, as Russia joined China and Japan in expressing interest
in buying new bonds from the European Financial Stability
Facility (EFSF) rescue fund.
 The euro briefly rallied to a one-month high against the
Swiss franc of 1.2994 francs ahead of a press conference by the
Swiss government, where some in the market has speculated
officials may try to talk down the Swiss currency.
 It retreated after the economics minister said he was
concerned about the currency's strength, while adding that Swiss
exporters were not yet in a crisis due to a strong franc.
 The Australian dollar was up 0.7 percent at $1.0050, having
hit a two-week high of $1.0066.
The dollar slipped 0.4 percent to 82.25 yen. It fell to a
two-week low just above 82.00 yen, with traders reporting bids
around that level preventing further losses.

 * Germany draws solid demand at two-year bond sale 
 * Portugal's borrowing costs fall at bill auction 
 * Portugal yields still seen as high
 
 By Kirsten Donovan
 LONDON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Germany sold just shy of 5
billion euros worth of two-year bonds on Wednesday, meeting
decent demand after short-dated yields rose to their highest in
more than a year on warnings of higher interest rates. 
 Portugal's 12-month borrowing costs, meanwhile, fell sharply
compared with a treasury bill auction last month, easing
pressure on the indebted country to seek a bailout after a
successful bond sale last week.
 Germany, whose bonds are the euro zone benchmarks at key
maturities, drew bids for 2.1 times the amount allotted, almost
double the demand at a December sale. That auction technically
failed to draw enough bids to cover the amount on offer.
The average yield at Wednesday's sale was 1.17 percent, up
from 0.92 percent last month and in line with moves on the
secondary market.
 ""Obviously it was a very strong auction result. Nominal bids
of over 10.5 billion are the highest amount we've seen in at
least six months and a bid-cover of above two compares very well
to the 2010 average,"" said Michael Leister, a rate strategist at
WestLB in Duesseldorf.
 ""Taken together with tight pricing, this really indicates
strong demand. The key reason is the high outright yields
following the Trichet sell-off at the short end which were
enough to attract the investor interest.""
 Two-year yields have risen to their highest since the
beginning of 2010 after the market brought forward expectations
of euro zone interest rate hikes following a warning from
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet's that the
bank could take steps to contain inflation.
 ECB policymakers have cooled the inflation talk this week,
but German two-year yields, most susceptible to interest rate
changes, remain elevated by recent standards.
 German 10-year Bunds sold off after the auction, but traders
attributed the move to a newspaper report that Germany was
considering a plan which would allow Greece to buy back its own
debt, rather than to problems digesting the new paper.
 Bond auctions by the region's triple-A rated issuers have
met good demand in January, supported by sizeable cash inflows
from coupon and redemption payments. France sells up to 9
billion euros of two- and five-year bonds on Thursday.
 
 PORTUGAL 
 Portugal's 12-month T-bill yield fell to 4.029 percent from
5.281 percent in an auction with a similar maturity on Dec. 1,
coming in slightly lower than expected and also in line with the
secondary market.
 The auction further bolsters the Socialist government's
determination to continue financing itself in debt markets
rather than following Greece and Ireland in seeking a bailout,
as many economists think Portugal will eventually have to do.
 ""This auction confirms that Portugal has still access to the
market but at high cost. Indeed, while cost of funding has
sharply decreased, at the one-year maturity a yield level of
4.029 percent is still very high in absolute terms,"" said Chiara
Cremonesi, fixed income strategist at UniCredit Research.
 Portugal last week sold 10-year bonds at lower yields than
at a previous sale, in an auction seen as a key test of its
ability to fund itself at sustainable rates.
 Cremonesi added that although Wednesday's auction result was
likely to reassure investors, underlying sentiment towards
Portugal remained fragile and uncertainty high.

 * Central bank sees no need for ""big"" provisions

(Adds more quotes, details, background)
 By Ulf Laessing and Reem Shamseddine
 RIYADH, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Saudi banks have taken enough
measures against bad loans and are poised for growth as lending
in the world's top oil exporter will accelerate this year, the
Gulf Arab kingdom's central bank governor said on Wednesday.
 Most banks in the biggest Arab economy have posted upbeat
fourth-quarter results, with several above analysts' average
forecasts, after booking provisions in the third quarter.
However, credit growth in the kingdom remains in single digits.
 ""It's clear that when bad loans go down, then provisions go
down as well so banks undertook less ... in the fourth quarter,""
Muhammad al-Jasser told Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television.
 ""They have taken enough... to tackle any situation now,"" he
said, adding that he saw no need for ""big"" provisions.
 Saudi banks are set to expand this year and credit growth
would accelerate beyond 5 percent achieved last year, Jasser
said.
 ""Lending will grow and accelerate,"" he said, without giving
figures.
 Jasser, who said in October provisions for bad loans in the
OPEC member should exceed 100 percent of their value, declined
to say whether provisions would fall in 2011.
 ""The provisions put Saudi banks in a very strong position,""
he said.
 The Saudi banking sector had been hit by debt restructuring
in family-owned businesses in the past. 
 As a result, lending growth stalled in December 2009 but it
has been picking up slowly over the past few months with the pace
well below over 20 percent rates seen at the beginning of 2009.
 Most Saudi banks exceeded average analyst forecast with net
profit in the fourth quarter, among them HSBC affiliate SABB
and Banque Saudi Fransi, part-owned by France's Calyon.

 (Adds details)
 BERLIN, Jan 19 (Reuters) - A German newspaper said on
Wednesday Berlin was considering a Greek sovereign debt
rescheduling plan that would allow Athens to buy back its own
debt using a euro zone crisis fund.
 Greece's deputy finance minister said no talks on debt
restructuring were ongoing. It had denied on Tuesday that it
would seek to extend the repayment period of its debt after the
deputy prime minister spoke in support of a such a plan.
 Die Zeit weekly, citing unnamed government sources, said in
a preview of Thursday's edition that the plan was to let Greece
use credits from the European Financial Stability Facility
(EFSF), in return for a commitment to pro-stability policies.
 The newspaper used the word 'Umschuldung', which could refer
to either a restructuring or a rescheduling. It gave no more
details about the plan or conditions of any such buyback.
 It did however add that, again according to unnamed sources,
Germany was ""no longer fundamentally opposed to increasing the
lending capacity of the EFSF"" as part of a broader package of
measures to stabilise the euro.
 This is largely in line with what Finance Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble has said regarding the need for a ""complete package""
that would address the limits to the real capacity of the euro
rescue package because of its complex guarantee system.

are healthy and the region's sovereign ratings are on a stable

Wednesday.	
 ""Looking at Asia as a whole, we do not see any contagion
from the Eurozone periphery due to lower levels of gross

Byrne, senior vice president at Moody's sovereign risk group.	
 He added that fears of property bubbles in Asia were
overstated and did not pose a threat to financial systems as the
run-up in prices has so far been confined to certain segments.	
 The ratings agency does not, however, expect significant
improvements in Asian corporate ratings.	
 ""Various challenges, such as the appetite for M&A,
tightening of monetary conditions and a rise in input costs,
will counter the continued strong economic conditions forecast
across the region,"" said Clara Lau, a chief credit officer at
Moody's corporate finance group.	
 Moody's earlier this month upgraded Indonesia's country
rating to Ba1 from Ba2 and changed the outlook on the
Philippines' Ba3 rating to positive from stable.	
 It, however, downgraded Vietnam to B1 from Ba3 and
maintained a negative outlook in December.	
 Moody's Ba1 rating is roughly equal to the BB-plus ratings
assigned by rival agencies Standard & Poor's and Fitch while a
Ba3 rating is similar to a BB-minus. 
 Moody's said that while Indonesia suffers ""deficiencies in
the legal system"" and is at risk from a reversal of portfolio
investments, the ratio of government debt to GDP is falling.	
 The country's plan to set up a bond stabilisation fund will
also alleviate the danger of a sudden withdrawal of funds by
bond investors.	
 As for Vietnam, Moody's said the danger of a balance of
payment crisis has risen and the government needs to rein in
inflation expectations to encourage investors in the country to
hold dong-denominated assets instead of hoarding gold and
foreign currency.	
 ""Bottomline is the state bank is losing foreign currency,""
said Byrne.

 By Leika Kihara
 TOKYO, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Japan's economy is expected to
escape from a lull by March or at least during the first half of
this year, the Bank of Japan's top economist said, in a sign the
central bank is turning more confident about the prospects of an
early return to moderate recovery.
 Economic growth may have contracted in the final quarter of
last year but that was likely a temporary dip with some bright
signs seen in exports, output and private consumption, said Kazuo
Momma, the head of the BOJ's research and statistics department.
 ""There are various factors that could destabilise the global
economy which, through exchange-rate and other market moves,
could affect the Japanese economy. But the outlook for this year
is positive,"" he told a seminar on Wednesday.
 His comments echo those by some regional BOJ branch managers
who signalled on Monday that an end to a lull in the economy was
in sight.
 Private economists are divided on exactly when Japan will
pull out of the doldrums, with Momma's view leaning towards the
side of the optimists.
 ""I don't see Momma's view as too optimistic or out of line
given robust overseas growth and prospects for a recovery in
factory output,"" said Naoki Iizuka, senior economist at Mizuho
Securities.
 SHIRAKAWA BRIEFS KAN
 The BOJ is expected to tweak its growth forecasts slightly
next week while keeping monetary policy on hold and sticking to
its view that firm demand in Asia will pull the economy out of
stagnation in a few months.
 Momma projected that Japan's economy would expand more than 3
percent in the year ending in March and grow anywhere between 1
and 2 percent the following year. That is roughly in line with
estimates by private sector analysts.
 The BOJ's new growth forecasts should fall in line with
Momma's forecasts, although final figures will be decided by its
nine board members at a rate review next week.
 Momma is regarded as among those in the BOJ who are more
optimistic about Japan's economic outlook.
 But he added that, while emerging economies are expected to
maintain solid growth this year, Japan's economy is not without
downside risks such as an expected slow recovery in the U.S. jobs
market and lingering jitters over Europe's debt woes.
 Renewed rises in the yen, if they persist, may also cloud the
outlook for the export-reliant economy, although the gains so far
have not been sharp enough to spur monetary easing next week.
 The dollar briefly fell to a two-week low of 82.01 yen on
Wednesday. One of Japan's two vice finance ministers told Reuters
that the yen's current strength is excessive and deviates from
Japan's economic fundamentals.
 BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said he did not discuss the
yen's rise in a meeting with Prime Minister Naoto Kan on
Wednesday, which was a regular get-together between the two that
is held about once every three months.
 Japan's economy is currently at a standstill with any rebound
from an expected contraction in the final quarter of last year
seen modest. But analysts say Japan will avoid a double-dip
recession, with exports picking up on firm demand in emerging
Asia and automakers increasing production.

 By Nopporn Wong-Anan	
 SINGAPORE, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Asia's rapid economic growth
will moderate slightly in 2011 even as policymakers combat
rising prices with higher interest rates and try to keep local
currencies from appreciating too sharply, a Reuters quarterly
poll showed.	
 Most of the 13 Asia-Pacific economies covered in a Reuters
survey are expected to see growth cool in 2011 from 2010 as
economic recoveries in the United States and Europe remain
uneven and China steps up its efforts to fight inflation and
asset bubbles.	
 Higher prices for food to fuel mean governments and central
banks in the region will have to tighten monetary policy further
or take other measures even if it risks curbing growth,
economists said.	
 The prospect of further tightening is already spooking some
foreign investors who flocked to the region last year, drawn by
its robust growth and higher returns. Indonesian stocks
have recoiled after a sizzling 46 percent gain in 2010, with
selling attributed to profit taking and concerns that its
central bank may be behind the curve in fighting price
pressures.	
 ""Later this year, Asian policymakers are going to have to be
much more aggressive to get inflation under control and the
consequence of that will be weaker growth,"" Nomura Chief
Economist Asia Robert Subbaraman said.	
 ""For Asia, the challenging part is how to deal with
inflation at the time when there is still capital inflows to the
region. The risk in Asia is policy is either too slow to respond
or the micro or piecemeal measures that have been
introduced...are going to lose their effectiveness overtime,"" he
said.

 China will likely record its slowest annual growth of the
year in the first quarter of 2011, but it will still be a hearty
8.7 percent, giving the government more confidence to tighten
policy further to rein in racing inflation, according to the
Reuters poll. 
 The median forecast of 27 analysts is for China's gross
domestic product to grow 9.3 percent in 2011, stronger than the
8.9 percent forecast in the previous poll published on Oct 14.	
 The world's second-largest economy is expected to have grown
around 10 percent in 2010. The government is due to release
fourth-quarter and full-year data on Jan 20. 
 India, Asia's third-biggest economy, is set to grow at the
same robust pace seen over the last fiscal year, averaging at
8.7 percent in the year-ending March 2011, before slowing
slightly to 8.5 percent in the following year, the poll showed. 
 These figures are markedly above October's consensus of 8.4
percent and 8.3 percent respectively. 
 India's uncomfortably high inflation will subside only
gradually in the coming quarters, likely prompting the central
bank to hike interest rates more aggressively than earlier
thought, though the country will remain vulnerable to any food
supply shortages which are far harder to fix. 
 The wholesale price index , India's main
inflation gauge, is expected to rise by an average 8.8 percent
for the fiscal year ending March 2011 before declining to 6.4
percent in the following year.	
 This is considerably higher than 8.3 and 5.7 percent
forecast in the October survey.	
 
 FLOODS MAY SLOW AUSTRALIA FOR A TIME	
 Tapping on strong demand for resources, particularly from
China, Australia will see its two-decade long economic expansion
hit a speed bump this quarter as floods in Queensland curb coal
exports and consumer demand. However, a massive rebuilding
effort should then add significantly to growth, and likely fuel
price pressures, for months to come.	
 A Reuters poll of analysts found forecasts for gross
domestic product (GDP) growth for the current quarter had been
halved to around 0.4 percent, down from 0.8 percent in the prior
poll conducted in October. 
 Tech heavyweight South Korea will sustain its solid economic
growth this year after expanding at its fastest pace in eight
years in 2010, which may stoke consumer inflation already
building from soaring food prices, the Reuters poll showsed.	
 Officials have recently pointed to inflationary pressures in
China as also having a knock-on effect on South Korea's economy
in the form of higher prices for imported Chinese goods and
food.	
 Asia's fourth-largest economy is forecast to grow 4.3
percent in 2011, according to a median forecast of 15 analysts,
unchanged from the earlier survey published on Oct 14 and
slightly below the Bank of Korea's prediction in December of 4.5
percent. .	
 Southeast Asia, Hong Kong and Taiwan share similar stories
of rising prices, risks of assets bubbles and moderating growth,
highlighting the need for policymakers to act sooner rather than
later.	
 ""The message is clear: Asia needs to tighten monetary policy
rapidly. If it fails at this, it had better brace for a harsh
landing,"" HSBC economists said in their Asian Economics First
Quarter 2011 released this month.

    * Inflation to remain at elevated levels in short term
    * C.bank seen raising rates faster than earlier thought

    * Economy to grow at 8.5 percent in FY11/12

 By Anooja Debnath
    BANGALORE, Jan 19 (Reuters) - India's uncomfortably high
inflation will subside only gradually in the coming quarters as
the economy continues to race ahead, likely prompting the
central bank to hike interest rates more aggressively than
earlier thought, a Reuters poll showed.	
 The wholesale price index (WPI) , India's main
inflation gauge, is expected to rise by an average 8.8 percent
for the fiscal year ending March 2011 before easing to 6.4
percent in the following year.
    This is considerably higher than 8.3 and 5.7 percent
forecast in the October survey.	
 Driven by costlier food items, wholesale price inflation
soared to an annual 8.43 percent in December, compared with an
expected 8.35 percent and above the previous reading of 7.48
percent. 
 Many economists now believe the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
will be forced to undertake much swifter policy tightening than
was previously foreseen.	
 ""The unexpected rise in December inflation ... turned out to
be a game-changer, and is likely (to) push the central bank to
front-load another rate hike in January, despite the source of
pick-up coming largely from volatile food articles,"" said
Siddhartha Sanyal, chief economist at Barclays Capital in a
note.	
 Price growth would remain above the RBI's comfort levels,
according to the latest poll, averaging 7.7 percent in the
quarter ending March before easing to 5.5 percent in the second
half of 2012 -- a level the central bank had hoped to reach by
March this year.	
 The poll predicts the central bank will increase rates from
6.25 percent now to 7.0 percent by end-September this year, a
quarter earlier than was predicted in a Jan 5 survey, before the
latest inflation numbers were released.	
 From there, forecasters expect the RBI to increase rates
slowly to 7.50 percent by the end of next year.	
 The RBI, seen as Asia's most aggressive major central bank
after it increased rates six consecutive times last year, is set
to raise rates by at least 25 basis points in its Jan 25 policy
meeting, with some analysts even predicting a substantial 50
bps hike.
   GROWTH SLOWDOWN?
    While rampant inflation will be the RBI's primary concern,
it will also be mindful of a slowdown in growth -- mainly in
industrial output which slumped to an 18-month low of 2.7
percent rise in November from the 11.3 percent increase seen a
month earlier.
    The Indian economy is still set to grow at the same robust
pace seen over the last fiscal year, averaging 8.7 percent in
the year-ending March 2011, before moderating slightly to 8.5
percent in the following year. 
 These figures are markedly above October's consensus of 8.4
percent and 8.3 percent, respectively.	
 The poll sees growth remaining consistently above 8.0
percent year-on-year in every quarter until the end of next
year.	
 ""It (the Indian economy) will slow down from the current
year,"" said A. Prasanna, head of research at ICICI Securities
Primary Dealership.
    ""It's partly because of agriculture -- this year agriculture
is rebounding from a drought, so there is the base effect in
play, next year that won't be the case.""
    ""On top of that, industrial and services sectors should also
slow down because (the) RBI has tightened policy and on the
fiscal side also there is likely to be some tightening.""
    Manufacturing and services PMI readings for December, which
underlined some slack in the economy, further stressed the
uneasy balance between inflation and growth facing the central
bank.

 By Kim Yeonhee	
 SEOUL, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The South Korean economy will
sustain its solid growth this year after expanding at its fastst
pace in eight years in 2010, which may stoke consumer inflation
already building from soaring food prices, a Reuters poll shows.
 Asia's fourth-largest economy is forecast to grow 4.3
percent in 2011, according to a median forecast of 15 analysts,
unchanged from the earlier survey published on Oct 14 and
slightly below the Bank of Korea's prediction in December of 4.5
percent.	
 Its growth rate in the first half of this year would be
softer than in the second half, with persistent euro zone debt
woes and an uneven U.S. recovery likely to eat away at resilient
domestic demand supported by growth in employment and incomes.
Further policy tightening steps in China could also crimp demand
for the world's No.7 exporter.	
 South Korea's gross domestic product probably expanded by
6.1 percent in 2010, a strong turnaround from meagre 0.2 percent
growth in 2009, the Bank of Korea said.

 The central bank is set to release fourth-quarter GDP on
Jan. 26.	
 ""The economy is projected to pass the cyclical trough in the
first half of 2011, helped by healthy domestic demand and
exports,"" said Lee Sung-kwon, a Shinhan Investment Corp's
economist.	
 ""Inflationary pressure is estimated to rise due to global
raw material price hikes, grain price increases, (imported)
inflation from China, and domestic service price increase.""	
 Consumer inflation is seen accelerating to 3.4 percent this
year, a faster pace than what was forecast in October and
compared with last year's reading of 2.9 percent.	
 Outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in livestock are adding
add to inflationary pressures by pushing meat prices higher.
South Korea has culled about 15 percent of its combined pig and
cattle population to contain the widespread disease.

 In a battle against inflation expectations, the Bank of
Korea will likely raise its base rate by a total of 75 basis
points to 3.50 percent by the end of December, on top of a
quarter-point hike last Thursday.	
 In October's survey, analysts saw the base rate coming to
3.25 percent by the end of 2011.	
 The survey was conducted just before the Bank of Korea
unexpectedly lifted the 7-day repurchase agreement rate
by 25 basis points to 2.75 percent on Jan. 13.	
 A separate poll shortly after the January rate move also
suggested market participants boosted expectations of policy
rate rises to 3.50 percent by the end of this year.

 The South Korean government has put its first-half policy
focus on price stability with the aim of keeping 2011 consumer
inflation at 3 percent. It last week unveiled a set of
anti-inflation measures, including cutting import tariffs on
selected items and freezing electricity tariffs.	
 Policy efforts to temper inflationary pressures may allow
the won to appreciate further to 1,060.00 per dollar by
the end of June and 1,000.00 by end-2012, from Tuesday's local
close at 1,116.6, the Reuters poll shows.	
 The won was the worst performer among emerging
economy currencies last year, despite record-setting exports
growth. It gained 2.6 percent against the dollar in 2010, due in
part to frequent intervention by the authorities who were
concerned a stronger rise would threaten export competitiveness.	
 Trade balance is forecast to increase to $30.6 billion this
year, up from the previous estimate of $28.0 billion given with
exports seen as gaining steam in the latter part of 2011.

Shanghai released its annual China Business Report on Wednesday.	
 AmCham Shanghai's business climate report surveyed 346
American companies operating in China. Results from the survey
show companies optimistic and performing well.	
 But the survey also highlights lingering concerns over
issues such as intellectual property rights and a lack of
transparency. 
 Below are some of the survey's results (for full story see
:	
 
 TOP CHALLENGES	
 1. Human resources constraints 
 * A comparison of survey results across years shows U.S.
companies found it more difficult to attract managers,
executives, technical staff and other skilled workers in 2010
than in 2009.	
 
 2. Inconsistent regulatory interpretation	
 * Nearly 80 percent of companies agree that China's
regulatory environment is not transparent, though China has
demonstrated an increased commitment to transparency and has
made several pieces of draft legislation available for public
comment.	
 
 3. Unclear regulations	
 * China's government procurement rules and ""indigenous
innovation"" policies, which promote bringing to market
home-grown technologies, may restrict opportunities for foreign
companies from competing fairly in China's growing procurement
market valued at $88 billion.	
 
 4. Bureaucracy	
 
 5. Lack of transparency	
 
 6. Intellectual property rights infringements	
 * According to this year's survey, 71 percent of respondents
feel enforcement of intellectual property rights ""stayed the
same"" or ""deteriorated,"" up from 61 percent in 2009 and 64
percent in 2008. It remains a top concern because U.S. companies
perceive a lack of protection and enforcement for intellectual
property rights to be a blow to their competitive advantage and
is costing U.S. companies billions of dollars.	
 
 7. Tax administration	
 
 8. Domestic protectionism	
 
 9. Difficulty enforcing contracts	
 
 10. Corruption	
 
 SUCCESS INDICATOR	
 The success indicator measures U.S. companies' business
performance. Companies in China are considered successful to the
extent survey responses meet requirements such as profitability,
revenue growth exceeding 20 percent, and ""very positive"" cash
flow. 
 Below indicates the top percentage of industries that

 SHANGHAI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - An increasing number of U.S.
companies in China say the enforcement of intellectual property
rights has deteriorated in the last year and that the regulatory
environment is the biggest hurdle to doing business there, a
survey showed on Wednesday.	
 The annual survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in
Shanghai, which bills itself as the ""voice of American business""
in China, comes as Chinese President Hu Jintao began a state
visit to the United States. 
 China drew a record $105.7 billion in foreign direct
investment last year, with inflows rising more than 17 percent
from the previous year as global firms piled into the country to
tap its vast and growing market. 
 An increasing number of U.S. companies in China expect
higher revenue in 2011, but nearly two-thirds of the respondents
in the survey said the regulatory environment had either
remained stable or deteriorated over the past year.	
 Some 71 percent of respondents said that enforcement of
intellectual property rights had stayed the same or deteriorated
in 2010, up from 61 percent in 2009 and 64 percent in 2008.	
 Brenda Foster, president of the Shanghai chamber, said U.S.
companies have found a way to succeed despite the challenges of
the Chinese market.	
 ""Nonetheless, it is essential that the U.S. continues to
aggressively engage China to address key business challenges
that hinder market access today and could impact future
investment,"" she said in a statement.	
 
 China has arrested more than 4,000 people for violating
intellectual property rights since November and will enforce
tougher punishments to combat the ""rampant"" problem, a senior
government official said last week. 
 U.S. and European corporations say recent crack downs have
had little effect, with complaints about fake brand-name goods
being overtaken by claims of Chinese firms assimilating more
patent-heavy foreign technology.	
 High-speed trains, auto designs, mobile phones and
wind turbines have all been the subject of vitriol about
whether Chinese firms have stolen foreign companies' patents
or whether the Chinese government has excluded
foreign competitors by demanding that they hand over valuable
patents and designs. 
 The International Intellectual Property Alliance,
which represents U.S. copyright industry groups, has estimated
U.S. trade losses in China due to piracy at $3.5 billion in
2009.	
 ""IPR remains a top concern because U.S. companies perceive a
lack of IPR protection and enforcement to be a blow to their
competitive advantage and is costing U.S. companies billions of
dollars in lost revenue each year,"" the survey said.	
 
 HIGHER REVENUE	
 The Board of governors of the American Chamber of Commerce
in Shanghai includes top company officials from the Chinese
operations of Citibank, FedEx , Goodyear Tire & Rubber
, APCO Worldwide, Corning and General Motors
.	
 The American Chamber of Commerce survey was conducted from
mid-November to early December 2010 and a total of 346 companies
participated, with a 25 percent response rate.	
 The results showed U.S. companies found it more difficult in
2010 to attract managers, executives, technical staff and other
skilled workers compared with 2009, mainly due to increasing
competition from domestic firms.	
 The report said 71 percent of respondents expected their
2011 revenue to increase by at least 10 percent, up from 60
percent in a similar survey last year.	
 Some 41 percent of respondents said they expected to
increase their investment in China in the year ahead by more
than 15 percent, double the number of respondents who said the
same thing last year.	
 Nearly 61 percent of the firms in the survey said that they
gained market share for their China products or services, up
from 40 percent in 2009.	
 Later on Wednesday, Hu and U.S. President Barack Obama are
expected to drop by a meeting at the White House of top
executives from the two countries.	
 ""The ""in China for China"" trend is one we have identified in
past surveys and is critical to note,"" the survey said.	
 ""Opportunities for U.S. companies have the potential to
increase dramatically as China's domestic market continues to
mature and becomes increasingly driven by explosive middle class
growth and a widening consumer base.""	
 Of the three major sectors covered by the survey --
manufacturing, services and retail -- retail was the strongest
performer backed by booming consumer demand.	
 The services sector underperformed mainly due to operating
barriers and limited market access.

 BEIJING, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Chinese consumer
prices rose 4.6 percent in the year to December, Hong Kong media
reported on Wednesday, a slowdown from a 5.1 percent pace in
November that would reduce the need for aggressive monetary
tightening.	
 The rate of inflation would, however, exceed the 4.4 percent
forecast in a Reuters poll, keeping pressure on the government
to mop up the excess cash in the economy that has driven prices
higher.	
 China's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 10.3 percent last
year, Hong Kong-based Phoenix Television also reported on its
website. The median forecast of economists polled by Reuters was
for GDP to increase 10.2 percent.	
 Phoenix TV cited an unnamed central bank source. Similar
numbers had been circulating as rumours in the domestic market.	
 China is scheduled to publish the numbers at 0200 GMT on
Thursday.	
 The country's main stock index in Shanghai rose 1
percent in its morning session, clawing back some ground after
falling steeply at the start of the week.	
 Weekly food price movements have long pointed to a decline
in inflationary pressure in December, but many analysts also
reckoned that any slowdown in inflation could be temporary.	
 China is not alone in battling inflation. A Reuters
quarterly poll showed policymakers across Asia are expected to
tighten monetary policy this year to curb rising prices, even if
that risks dampening growth. 
 The Chinese economy is seen slowing a touch to grow 9.3
percent this year while inflation quickens to 4.3 percent. 
 Analysts expect China's inflation to pick up
as soon as January because the Lunar New Year holiday falls
earlier in the calendar this year compared with 2010 and because
of harsh winter weather.	
 Food price data compiled by the commerce ministry has showed
that vegetables and meat have become more expensive since the
start of the year.	
 China has officially raised banks' required reserves seven
times since the start of last year, but has increased interest
rates only twice during that time. Many economists and investors
expect that gradual mode of tightening to continue in coming
months.	
 China's full-year CPI in 2010 rose an average of 3.3
percent, while the producer price index increased an average of
5.9 percent in 2010, Phoenix TV added.

 By Chris Buckley and Matt Spetalnick
 WASHINGTON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama
pressed Chinese President Hu Jintao on Wednesday to let the
value of China's currency rise and delivered a firmer message
on U.S. concerns over Beijing's human rights record.
 Amid the pomp of a state visit, both leaders spoke
glowingly about cooperation but made no major breathroughs on a
range of disputes over trade and security that have strained
relations over the past year.
 Hu gave up little aside from $45 billion in export deals
that seemed aimed at quelling anti-Chinese sentiment in the
United States and allowing Obama to tout job creation as U.S.
unemployment remains stubbornly above 9 percent.
 ""We've shown that the United States and China, when we
cooperate, can receive substantial benefits,"" Obama said with
Hu at his side at a White House news conference.
 But Obama zeroed in quickly on one of the most sensitive
disputes between the world's two biggest economic powers,
telling Hu that China's yuan remains undervalued. Beijing's
critics say its currency practices hurt the competitiveness of
U.S. business by making its exports artificially cheap.
 ""There needs to be further adjustment in the exchange
rate,"" Obama said bluntly.
 Hu listened to Obama's complaints about the yuan during the
news conference but pointedly did not comment, giving no clues
about China's intentions on the hot-button issue.
 MORE ASSERTIVE ON HUMAN RIGHTS
 Obama took a more assertive stance on human rights than he
did during his 2009 visit to Beijing, when critics at home said
he was too deferential to his hosts. Still, he was measured in
his words to avoid antagonizing China's communist leadership.
 ""I repeated to President Hu we have some core views as
Americans about the universality of certain rights, freedom of
speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, that we think
are very important and that transcend cultures,"" he said.
 ""I have been very candid with President Hu about these
issues,"" he added.
 Obama also urged Chinese dialogue with representatives of
the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader widely admired
internationally but regarded by Beijing as part of an
illegitimate separatist cause.
 Hu insisted China had made ""enormous progress"" on human
rights but acknowledged ""a lot still needs to be done,""
although he gave no specifics.
 Obama said he and Hu agreed that North Korea must avoid
""further provocations"" and that U.N. sanctions on Iran must be
fully enforced. U.S. officials have sometimes chided Beijing
for not doing enough to help rein in Tehran and Pyongyang,
whose nuclear ambitions worry the United States and its
allies.
 In a joint statement, Obama and Hu appeared to set aside
recent rancor over North Korea, which caused alarm with the
shelling of a South Korean island and claims of new nuclear
advances. But it offered no new ways to contain Pyongyang.
 Obama acknowledged the yuan had edged up against the dollar
in recent months but said it was not enough. ""So we'll continue
to look for the value of China's currency to be increasingly
driven by the market, which will help ensure that no nation has
an undue economic advantage,"" he said.
 In the joint statement, China said it remained committed to
reforming its exchange rate policies and agreed to seek ways to
create more balanced trade flows between the two countries.
 Beijing has so far resisted demands for faster appreciation
of its currency --a move that could help lower China's trade
surplus with the United States, which Washington puts at $270
billion.
 Congressional pressure is building for legislation to
punish Beijing over its trade and currency policies. A group of
84 lawmakers urged Obama in a letter on Wednesday to tell Hu
that ""America's patience is near an end.""
 Welcoming Hu in a carefully choreographed ceremony, Obama
hailed the event as a chance to demonstrate that the countries
""have an enormous stake in each other's success.""
 Speaking later to a group of U.S. and Chinese business
leaders, Obama pressed for a level playing field with China on
trade, while Hu made the same appeal for Chinese companies
operating in the United States.
 The two countries used the summit to unveil a series of
deals, including China's purchase of 200 Boeing aircraft. U.S.
officials said the $45 billion in deals would support an
estimated 235,000 American jobs.
 China may hope the deals can help soothe the U.S. public's
ire over job losses and trade deficits.
 Obama told reporters some progress was made on thorny trade
issues. He said China pledged improved U.S. access to bid for
Chinese government contracts, estimated at some $80 billion
annually, but more work was needed on intellectual property.
 Obama wants to show he is serious about leaning on China
for concessions that could boost the anemic U.S. recovery and
reduce high unemployment -- both seen as crucial to his chances
of re-election in 2012.
 Hu was greeted with a 21-gun salute, honor guards and the
playing of both national anthems in a show meant to convey
recognition of China's growing international stature.
 Hu had been expected to raise his worries about U.S.
economic and security policies, including arms sales to Taiwan,
the self-ruled island that China deems a breakaway province.
 Beijing also wants the Obama administration's reassurances
that China's big holdings of U.S. government debt are not
threatened because of what some critics describe as loose U.S.
fiscal policies.

80,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2011 12:04AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-China 2010 rare earth exports down 9.3 pct," (Adds value details, background)
 BEIJING, Jan 19 (Reuters) - China's exports of rare earth
elements fell 9.3 percent in 2010 despite an acceleration of
shipments in December, data showed on Wednesday.
 China exported 4,738 tonnes of rare earth metals, ores and
compounds in December, more than twice as much as in November,
bringing its full-year export volume to 39,813 tonnes.
 China, by far the world's biggest supplier of rare earths,
has angered many of its trade partners by restricting exports of
the metals, which have many uses in renewable energy, aerospace
and electric cars, as well as consumer electronics.
 Although volumes shipped out of China have dwindled, the
value of trade has skyrocketed. December's tonnage was down by
almost two-thirds from December 2009, but the value was up
fourfold at $309.2 million on a free-on-board basis.
 That brought the value of the full-year's exports to $939.7
million, three times the $310.1 million China earned from the
trade in 2009.
 December's exports were valued at an average of $65,257 per
tonne, the culmination of five months of rapid price increases.
In July, the average value per tonne was $14,405, but that figure
has increased by more than $10,000 in each successive month.

the new representative office on Friday, said the source, who
declined to be named.
 A separate source familiar with the plans said CIC will hold
an opening ceremony in Toronto later this week.
 A CIC spokesperson declined to comment.
 ""The reason for (choosing) Toronto may be twofold -- one for
investment in Canada's natural resources, the second is usually
tax"" as compared to New York, a Singapore-based fund manager said
on condition of anonymity.
 The extension to Toronto comes as CIC is trying to expand its
business operations internationally and be taken seriously as a
global investment group.
 CIC opened a Hong Kong office last year, led by Laurence Lau,
a former Stanford University professor and former Vice-Chancellor
of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
 CIC made a splash with two of its original investments,
taking significant stakes in investment bank Morgan Stanley
 and private equity firm Blackstone Group . 
 Not long afterward, the financial crisis took a heavy toll on
those stakes, and CIC quickly found itself in the spotlight and
under pressure for the decline in the value of the holdings.
 Since then, the fund has sought to diversify away from
financial holdings, turning toward natural resources-related
investments in Canada and Indonesia. 
 The fund was set up in 2007 with a mandate to earn a higher
return for the state government on a sliver of China's
international reserves, which now total $2.85 trillion, the
largest in the world. 
CIC, which also holds big stakes in China's major
state-controlled banks, added $58 billion to its overseas
holdings in 2009, mainly in publicly traded bonds and stocks.

 * Eyes on U.S. earnings, Goldman later in the day
 * Dollar falls broadly, euro hits one-mth high

 By Yoko Nishikawa	
 SINGAPORE, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose to their
highest since May 2008 on Wednesday, led by sectors most
sensitive to the economic growth cycle ahead of U.S. earnings,
while the U.S. dollar slid to a two-month low, weighed by
traders closing short-term bets against the euro.
    Goldman Sachs will be a focus later, when the Wall Street
bank posts fourth quarter results.	
 A rally in riskier assets, which has lifted the U.S. S&P 500
stocks index to its highest since September 2008 and
pressed on despite the euro zone fiscal crisis, has been fed by
hopes that the world's No.1 economy could return to a
sustainable recovery path. 
 Positive U.S. earnings surprises could also keep the rally
alive. 
 The dollar index , which measures the dollar against a
basket of major currencies, fell to a two-month low as
short-covering encouraged by talk of Asian central bank buying
of the euro pushed the single currency to a one-month high
around $1.3475 , with its Dec. 14 high of $1.3500 seen as
a major resistance level.	
 ""People are covering euro short positions as Asian sovereign
names have been buying the euro on dips in the past few days,""
said a trader for a Japanese bank in Tokyo. 
 As market players remain wary about China's fight against
inflation, Hong Kong media reported that Chinese consumer prices
rose 4.6 percent in the year to December, a slowdown from a 5.1
percent pace in November that would alleviate the need for
aggressive monetary tightening.

 HOPES FOR ROBUST U.S. EARNINGS 
 The MSCI index of Asia and Pacific shares excluding Japan
rose more than 1 percent, helped by sectors such
as technology, energy and raw materials. Its tech sub-index
was up 1.4 percent, while the materials
component rose nearly 1.5 percent.	
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc reports its earnings later in
the day, with analysts expecting quarterly profit to have fallen
by roughly half, hit by the same adverse fixed income trading
environment that slammed Citigroup Inc's results a day
earlier. 
 Goldman shares have held up far better than many rivals. Its
shares closed Tuesday at $174.68, above where they were when the
financial crisis exploded in September 2008. 
""I'm expecting a pretty good quarter, but expectations have
gotten up there as you can tell by the stock price,"" said Keith
Davis, an analyst at Farr, Miller & Washington in Washington,
D.C., which invests $710 million and owns Goldman stock. 
 More earnings results are on the way: Morgan Stanley
on Thursday and Bank of America Corp on Friday. 	
 Google , whose increased price targets lifted its
shares, reports later this week, and results of the heavy
equipment maker Caterpillar are due next week. 
 A mostly upbeat start to the U.S. earnings season lifted
expectations for Japanese firms to show further recovery, with
the benchmark Nikkei ending the day up 0.4 percent.	
 The Shanghai Composite Index also rose 1.5 percent,
while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 1 percent.	
 The euro rose even though higher-yielding euro zone bonds
fell on Tuesday after the Dutch finance minister said the
Eurogroup had rejected enlarging a rescue fund for the region's
more indebted states. 
 Gareth Berry, G10 FX strategist for UBS in Singapore, said
if sovereign debt of euro zone peripheral countries stays under
pressure it could eventually weigh on the euro.	
 ""Watch those sovereign bond yield spreads in Europe. They
pushed wider again yesterday. The euro didn't seem to notice.
But I think it will notice if it keeps going much longer.""	
 In Washington, Chinese President Hu Jintao arrived for a
four-day state visit against a backdrop of U.S. complaints that
Beijing should do more to let the yuan strengthen.

 The broad fall in the dollar helped push up U.S. crude above
$91 a barrel , but its gains will likely be capped by the
impending restart of Alaska's main oil pipeline and a suggestion
by the International Energy Agency that OPEC may have raised
output in response to high oil prices. 
 Dollar weakness also supposed spot gold , which rose
by 0.4 percent earlier and was seen on course for a third
consecutive day of gains.

 * As Nobel laureate, Obama should speak up - lawmaker
 * Gibbs says Obama will raise rights issues with Hu
 By David Alexander
 WASHINGTON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama
came under increasing pressure on Tuesday to publicly speak out
against Beijing's harsh treatment of political and religious
dissidents during a state visit this week by Chinese President
Hu Jintao.
 Dissidents representing China's minority Uighurs, Tibetans,
imprisoned democracy advocates and opponents of forced abortion
all urged Obama to address their concerns both publicly and
privately during Hu's four-day state visit, which began on
Tuesday evening.
 Congressman Chris Smith, who chairs a House of
Representatives panel on human rights, said it would be ""almost
unthinkable"" for a Nobel Peace laureate like Obama to meet with
""a political leader responsible for jailing another laureate
and not demand publicly for their fellow laureate's release.""
 The winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize, writer and
rights activist Liu Xiaobo, is imprisoned in China. His wife
was detained and denied permission to attend the Nobel ceremony
on his behalf and is still in custody, dissidents say.
 ""I truly hope that in the next few days, President Obama
lives up to the award he received in '09,"" said Smith, who
organized a news conference for Chinese rights advocates.
 Obama has had a mixed relationship with human rights
advocates and other traditionally liberal groups that have been
generally supportive of his agenda.
 He irritated some by putting off a 2009 White House meeting
with the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, in a move to
gain favor with China. He has failed to fulfill other pledges
important to rights advocates, like closing the prison for
terrorism suspects at Guantanamo, Cuba.
 White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Obama would raise
""his direct concerns on the issues of human rights"" when he
meets with Hu, who will be the first Chinese president to have
a White House dinner in his honor in 13 years.
 Gibbs defended the dinner with Hu, saying Obama believed it
was important to put himself in forums that would allow him to
discuss issues like human rights directly with those making the
decisions.
 But U.S. lawmakers and Chinese dissidents underscored the
importance of Obama speaking publicly and not just privately
about the issue.
 ""I urge President Obama to raise the issues of human rights
and religious freedom, not just behind closed doors, but in his
public statements as well,"" said Representative Frank Wolf,
another rights advocate in Congress.
 GAO'S RELEASE SOUGHT
 Geng He, the wife of detained human rights lawyer Gao
Zhisheng, appealed for Obama to seek the release of her
husband, saying her children had been terribly affected by his
absence and noting that Obama has written about the pain of
growing up without his father.
 Geng, whose husband was targeted by authorities after
taking on controversial human rights cases, urged Obama to ask
Hu to release Gao and ""let him come to the United States and
unite with our family.""
 Ngawang Sangdrol, who was held as a political prisoner by
China for supporting Tibetan independence, spoke of being
beaten with iron rods and water hoses and shocked with an
electric prod that made her body shake uncontrollably.
 She said Hu presided over a crackdown on the Tibet and
martial law when he was the Chinese leader of the Tibetan
autonomous region in the 1980s.
 Ngawang, who credits international pressure for securing
her release while serving a 21-year prison term, urged Obama
and the free world to press China on human rights, saying from
her experience it was ""very helpful.""
 Chai Ling, who was a student leader at the Tiananmen Square
massacre, sharply condemned China's population control
policies, which she said lead to 35,000 forced or coerced
abortions every day.
 ""It is a Tiananmen Square massacre happening every hour,""
she said.
 Most Chinese are barred from having more than a single
child. The policy is aimed at controlling China's 1.3 billion
population, but critics say it has resulted in forced abortions
and sterilizations and a widening gender gap that has
contributed to international sex trafficking.
 Reggie Littlejohn, president of Women's Rights Without
Frontiers, said, ""The Chinese forced abortion policy is
systematic, institutionalized violence against women.""

 NEW YORK, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a one-month
high against the dollar on Tuesday on central bank buying and a
surge in German investor sentiment, while global stocks rose
as positive company earnings outlooks boosted confidence in the
U.S. economic recovery.
 The euro rose to a one-month high above $1.34 against the
dollar after Germany's ZEW think tank said about 50 percent of
investors expect the European Central Bank will have to raise
interest rates within the next six months. For details see:

 ZEW's monthly index jumped in December to its highest level
since July. [ID:nLDE70H0UU]
 The euro rose as high as $1.3467  overnight,
though lack of progress at a two-day European debt summit
sparked a retreat and it traded up 0.66 percent at $1.3380.
 ""There are still fault lines, especially pertaining to
issues about the expansion of the rescue fund,"" said Simon
Derrick, head of currency research at Bank of New York Mellon.
""But countries like Russia and China need the euro as a
credible alternative currency.""
 Traders said sovereign buying, including demand from Middle
Eastern accounts on Tuesday, has helped the euro since it fell
to a four-month low beneath $1.29 last week.
 Optimism about U.S. company earnings reports have helped
fuel stocks and hopes that the world's largest economy is on
the path of recovery.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed 50.55
points, or 0.43 percent, higher at 11,837.93. The Standard &

 By Samantha Pearson and Sean Mattson
 SAO PAULO/MEXICO CITY, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Brazil's real
firmed on Tuesday ahead of an expected interest rate hike,
while Mexico's peso retreated after breaking the psychological
12 per dollar barrier for the first time since late 2008.
 Expectations that Brazil's central bank will have to raise
interest rates on Wednesday helped the real to outperform the
region. For more, see: [ID:nSPG003198]
 Brazil has been reluctant to raise its already high
borrowing costs for fear of attracting even more short-term,
speculative money. The Brazilian real  was bid 0.3
percent stronger at 1.676 per dollar on the local spot market.
 Rising inflation has made an interest rate hike seem
inevitable. While the consensus among economists and market
participants is for a 50-basis-point rise, the market has also
partially priced in a 75-basis-point increase.
 ""(A) recent surge in food commodity prices ... could
aggravate the situation further and could further deteriorate
inflation expectations,"" Zeina Latif, chief Brazil economist at
RBS in Sao Paulo, said in a research note.
 Rising investor sentiment in Germany and signs that
policymakers will eventually firm up plans to ease the euro
zone's debt crisis helped support riskier assets worldwide and
weakened the dollar. [ID:nLDE70H0UU] [ID:nLDE70H0DQ]
 The Chilean peso  also firmed 0.2 percent to 490.20
per dollar as the price of copper, the country's main export,
rose because of the weak dollar. [ID:nLDE70H0DP]
 PESO PULLBACK
 The Mexican currency  weakened 0.51 percent to
12.0325 per dollar as investors took profits after the peso
broke below the key 12-per-dollar level on Monday for the first
time since a steep devaluation in October 2008.
 The Mexican peso, which has lagged the gains in other
emerging market currencies, strengthened more than 5 percent
from a November intraday low to Tuesday's session high boosted
by an improving outlook for U.S. and Mexican growth.
 ""It looks like a good opportunity to lock in some of the
gains,"" said Marjorie Hernandez, an analyst at HSBC in New
York, who expected the peso to firm back toward 11.80 per
dollar.
 ""The underlying story hasn't changed. It's still a great
macro call for the year, people believe the U.S. is going to
recover, it's still cheap, and they still aren't intervening,""
she added.
 The Mexican currency has also been supported by flows from
investors looking for a haven from intervention tactics of
other central banks.
 Mexico's peso is barely clawing back toward its pre-crisis
levels, but analysts say Mexico's central bank could move to
increase a program under which it is selling $600 million of
dollar put options every month to local banks.
 Luis Flores, an analyst at brokerage IXE in Mexico City,
said a bigger options program would still be seen ""as a more
patient and subtle"" reaction compared with intervention
mechanisms in Chile, Brazil and Turkey. The shock of the
announcement could derail peso gains, but ""only for a matter of
days,"" he said.
 ""Fundamentally it will not remove the favorable tendency
for the peso,"" Flores said.
 The options allow local banks to sell dollars to the
central bank at a slightly preferential rate when the peso has
been on a winning streak and is below a 20-day moving average.
By sucking up dollars directly from banks, policymakers can
keep some dollar off the open market.
 Gabriel Casillas, an analyst at JP Morgan in Mexico City,
said the central bank could take a bolder move to begin daily
dollar purchases if further peso gains take the currency
quickly and significantly below 12 per dollar.
 ""This would still be a market-friendly mechanism --
relative to capital control measures that other countries have
recently adopted -- and could reduce the speed of appreciation
of the peso,"" Casillas wrote in a report.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Central bank buying and strong
German economic data pushed the euro to a one-month high above
$1.34 on Tuesday, though doubts about Europe's ability to boost
a sovereign rescue fund trimmed its gains in New York trade.
 Analysts, though, said the euro could yet extend gains in
the weeks ahead amid hope policymakers would prevent a debt
crisis that has engulfed Greece and Ireland from spreading.
 The Chinese yuan in the spot market hit its strongest level
since being de-pegged from the dollar in 2005 as Chinese
President Hu Jintao began a U.S. state visit. Offshore forwards
were little changed, though, suggesting doubts that gains would
persist past this week's visit.
 After closing its best week against the dollar in nearly
two years last Friday, the euro hit a one-month peak of $1.3467
overnight, though lack of progress at a two-day European debt
summit sparked a retreat to $1.3380. It was still up 0.7
percent on the day and was on track to outperform the dollar in
six of the past trading sessions.
 ""In the short-term, we're bullish on the euro and expect it
to head toward $1.36 in the coming weeks,"" said Mary Nicola,
currency strategist at BNP Paribas in New York.
 She said last week's European Central Bank inflation
warning has investors betting on a euro zone rate increase
sooner than previously thought. Data showing German economic
sentiment at a six-month high boosted that view..
 BNP, however, has a less optimistic long-term prognosis for
the euro, with uncertainty about Europe's handling of its debt
crisis seen pushing it toward $1.20 by the third quarter of
2011.
 Elsewhere, the dollar fell 0.1 percent to 82.62 yen while
sterling hit an eight-week peak of $1.6060 after
higher-than-forecast UK inflation data.
 The dollar recovered from a 2-1/2-year low of 0.9837
Canadian dollars after the Bank of Canada kept interest rates
at 1 percent and signaled it may stand pat for longer than
markets had expected.
 BOOSTING THE EURO
 Traders said sovereign buying, including demand from Middle
East accounts on Tuesday, has helped the euro since it fell to
a four-month low beneath $1.29 last week.
 Russia's Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said on Tuesday the
country was supportive of the euro zone's efforts to see off a
debt crisis and could buy new bonds from its European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF) rescue fund.
 But he refuted a report that Russia, holder of the world's
third largest currency reserves, was ready to resume buying
Spanish debt, which it dropped as an investment after rating
agencies downgraded Spain in November.
 Japan has also expressed interest in new EFSF bonds, while
China said it would buy the government debt of stressed euro
zone countries such as Greece, Portugal and Spain.
 ""There are still fault lines, especially pertaining to
issues about the expansion of the rescue fund,"" said Simon
Derrick, head of currency research at Bank of New York Mellon.
""But countries like Russia and China need the euro as a
credible alternative currency.""
 While the yuan has appreciated about 3.5 percent against
the dollar since the middle of last year, China's Hu has
refuted U.S. arguments that it needs to rise more quickly.
 Some analysts say it may take a stronger euro before China
agrees to let the yuan appreciate more rapidly against the U.S.
dollar, as a weak euro would undermine Chinese exports to
Europe and deprive Beijing of a counterweight to the dollar.
 The yuan has gained about 3.5 percent against the dollar
since mid-2010, and China has resisted U.S. pressure to allow
more rapid gains.

 * Central bank believed to be supporting pound indirectly
 * Any further weakening expected to be very slow
 
 By Patrick Werr
 CAIRO, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound stabilised on
Tuesday as the central bank apparently acted to support it,
after the currency fell to near a six-year low on Monday in
response to the political turmoil in Tunisia, traders said.
 In the spot market, the pound  strengthened marginally
to close at 5.8220 against the dollar from Monday's finish of
5.8240. At the end of last week, the Egyptian currency was
trading around 5.8000.
 Currency traders said that with Egyptian share prices
declining, it was almost certain that the central bank was
selling dollars to support the currency after Monday's decline.
 Dealers say the central rarely intervenes directly, but
often buys and sells the currency indirectly by way of one or
two local banks.
 ""On a day like today where the stock market went down 3.14
percent you would have totally seen an outflow, and the currency
appreciated, so it's clear the central bank intervened selling
dollars,"" said one dealer.
 Tuesday's decline in Egypt's benchmark stock index <.EGX30>
was the biggest in eight months and followed a 2.4 percent slide
on Monday, as investors worried that Tunisia's political
instability might eventually spread to Egypt or other countries
in North Africa.
 Economists said the central bank was likely to use its
unofficial reserves to ensure that any weakening of the pound
was gradual, so that Egyptian depositors did not take fright and
shift large amounts of their cash into dollars.
 Barclays Capital estimated foreign holdings of Egyptian
assets were close to $25 billion, with roughly half held in
Treasury bills and bonds. The high foreign exposure poses a
significant potential risk to the currency, Barclays said.

 FURTHER WEAKNESS POSSIBLE
 In a research note recommending that investors reduce their
Egyptian pound exposure, Barclays said it expected the currency
to weaken over coming months, reaching 6.00 in a year's time.
 Barclays cited increased political risk, the poor
performance of currency trades into the pound last year, the
central bank's focus on stimulating economic growth and
competiveness, which could cause it to oppose any strength of
the currency, and Egypt's deteriorating fiscal outlook.
 However, it added that it was reluctant to go short on the
Egyptian pound because of high interest rates in Egypt and the
central bank's determination to limit the currency's volatility.
 Trade in the non-deliverable forwards market, where the
Egyptian pound is traded for delivery on a future date, has
slowed since Tunisia's president was ousted because of a feeling
of increased risk, and deals taking place indicate the currency
will weaken in coming months, traders said.
 On Monday, the first working day since President Zine
al-Abidine fled Tunis, trade in the offshore NDF market dried up
entirely. Trades on Tuesday were worth about $30-40 million,
compared to daily levels of around $50 million before the
Tunisian crisis erupted, said a dealer based outside Egypt.
 ""There were some offers today,"" he said. ""There were some
clients trying to take advantage of the high implied yields on
the NDFs, betting that there won't be a problem. But in general
the market is much better bid,"" indicating pressure for the
Egyptian pound to depreciate.
 A one-month NDF, for delivery of Egyptian pounds in one
month's time, traded at 5.90 to the dollar on Tuesday, the
trader said.

manipulation pose both immediate and long-term challenges to
American manufacturers and workers still recovering from the
economic recession.""
 ""We recognize the Chinese government recently allowed its
currency to begin to appreciate. But as you rightly point out,
the path towards its currency appreciating to a true
market-based value remains long.""
 ""Until that happens, we believe the fair implementation of
trade remedy laws is required to provide industries a life-line
to compete. If one manufacturer is forced to close because we
fail to combat subsidized imports, that is one less
manufacturer able to export and help grow our economy.""
""In the coming weeks, we intend to introduce legislation in
the Senate to address the unlawful practice of currency
manipulation and to penalize violators of our global trade
rules.""
 DEMOCRATIC SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND IN LETTER TO OBAMA
 ""I recently wrote to you expressing my concern over the
government of China's involvement in activities to undermine
our nation's cybersecurity.""
 ""The potentially devastating consequences to the United
States illustrate the need to engage this issue at the highest
levels of government ... I urge you to make clear in your
meeting with President Hu that cybersecurity is among the top
issues in our countries' relationship.""
 ""I am also troubled by China's apparent intent to use its
stronghold on rare earth elements (REEs) extraction to restrict
export shipments, as well as to require end-user companies to
relocate to China ... The United States' reliance on imported
REEs makes us very vulnerable to disruptions in the global
supply chain threatened by Chinese actions in the future.""
 ""I was pleased that your administration raised this issue
with the Chinese leadership in recent conversations and has
taken it up in the G20 talks, and I strongly encourage you to
continue to press this issue at this opportunity.""
 REPUBLICAN REPRESENTATIVE J. RANDY FORBES, CHAIRMAN OF
CONGRESSIONAL CHINA CAUCUS, IN PUBLIC STATEMENT
 ""The way the administration approaches Mr. Hu's visit this
week will set the stage for future relations between the United
States and China.""
 ""While this administration's initial response may be to
roll out the red carpet, I hope President Obama will temper
graciousness with hardness and strength by sending two clear
messages to Mr. Hu: first, if China wants to be a responsible
stakeholder on the world stage, it must act like one; second,
the United States will remain steadfast in its determination to
block China's power plays across the globe when they are not in
the best interest of the United States and its allies.""
 ENGAGE CHINA COALITION, REPRESENTING U.S. BANKS, INSURERS
AND OTHER FINANCIAL FIRMS, IN LETTER TO OBAMA
 ""We respectfully urge you to focus on greater
market-opening reforms in China's financial services sector.
Such reform and modernization will help China achieve its
economic goals, including building a more services-based,
consumer-driven economy, while also benefiting the economies of
other nations.""
 ""Further, a more active Chinese consumer is a critical step
toward addressing persistent trade imbalances. Moreover, fair
and competitive access to China's fast-growing middle class and
business sector represents an enormous commercial opportunity
for American manufacturers, farmers and ranchers, and service
providers, with major implications for U.S. economic growth.""
 ""While current economic circumstances could complicate the
U.S.-China relationship, we believe that they also offer a
unique opportunity for both countries to build a more balanced,
sustainable, and mutually beneficial relationship.""
 ""Now more than ever, U.S. and Chinese leaders must work
together to address the current challenges that face the global
economy. There is a critical link between the need for reform
and modernization of China's financial sector, and the G20's
call for a more balanced pattern of global economic growth.""

 * Inflows, reforms and growth could be harmed
 * Lebanon will have to borrow more in 2011
 * Lebanon to refinance maturing Eurobonds by May
 
 (Adds details, quotes, background)
 By Mariam Karouny 
 BEIRUT, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Lebanon's economic growth and
reforms could be harmed if political deadlock continues,
caretaker finance minister said on Tuesday, after the collapse
of Saad al-Hariri's government last week.
 ""The longer the political impasse, the more we will see its
repercussions on the economy, but we have not entered the danger
stage,"" Raya al-Hassan told Reuters in an interview.
 ""The repercussions are: if this crisis continues for two or
three months this will affect the inflows.. the growth rate and
the reforms plans,"" she said.
 ""But not today. Today the situation is still under control,
the reserves in the central bank allow us to face the
repercussions,"" she said.
 Lebanon plunged into political crisis after Hezbollah and
its allies toppled Hariri's government in a dispute over an
indictment in the 2005 killing of statesman Rafik al-Hariri.
 The confidential draft indictment, which is expected to
accuse Hezbollah members, was issued at the U.N.-backed tribunal
on Monday, deepening tensions in Beirut and alarming leaders
across the region who fear Lebanon's sectarian and political
divisions may spill over to the wider Middle East.
 Ratings agency Standard and Poor's downgraded its outlook on
Lebanon's B credit rating to stable from positive, saying the
standoff ""severely weakened"" its economic growth prospects.
 So far the crisis has had no clear impact on Lebanon's
projected growth of 5 percent in 2011. But Hassan said if the
crisis becomes a ""security crisis"" the impact will be immediate.
 ""I assure people now that there isn't imminent danger, on
the contrary, the Lebanese pound is stable,"" she said.
 She added that there has been some selling of the Lebanese
pound  in recent days but it was a limited: ""People are
not panicking but there is anticipation,"" she said.
 Hassan said that Lebanon, already one of the most highly
indebted countries in the world, will have to borrow in 2011 to
cover expenditure.
 The Central Bank, which has foreign reserves of more than
$31 billion, said it remained committed to the stability of the
Lebanese pound.
 Lebanon has enjoyed strong growth in the past two years but
its ""unity"" government already suffered months of political
paralysis before it collapsed last week. It failed to get the
2010 budget through parliament, or launch significant reforms.
 ""We went through tougher crises before and there is not one
time where we did not fulfil our obligations. We have resiliency
to confront such crises,"" Hassan said.

 REFINANCING EUROBONDS
 Lebanon's public debt is expected to rise to $55 billion in
2011 from $51 billion projected in 2010 and analysts warn that
if the government does not act to cut spending and boost
revenues, public debt could rise as high as $65 billion in the
next three to five years with the deficit widening even more.
 ""We have Eurobonds coming up in 2011 -- more than $3.5
billion. This is separate from the other debt that we might
endure. We have to secure money for it so that we can refinance
it,"" Hassan said.
 ""There is no fear that we will not be able to fulfil the
fiscal needs when it comes to markets. From now until May we are
going to go to the market to refinance,"" she said.
 A source at the ministry said that Eurobonds maturing in May
were around $1.1 billion.
 Lebanon sold a $1.2 billion 10-year Eurobond in March which
attracted bids for about three times the amount of the issue,
indicating strong demand for the country's sovereign issues. It
also refinanced over $800 million that matured in November 2010.
Hassan said Lebanon was not planning to increase interest
rates in the short term. 
 ""Never. It took us a long time to stabilise interest rates
on the current levels and no plans to change,"" she said. ""(But)
if the risk substantially increases you will see widening of the
margins,"" she said.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar on Tuesday on buying by sovereign funds and strong
German economic data but doubts Europe can boost a rescue fund
to head off debt problems may prevent further gains.
 After surging more than 1 percent, the euro pared gains
against the dollar and traded at the New York session low, the
single currency pressured by lack of progress at the two-day
European debt summit. More details click,.
 The euro was last at $1.3370 on electronic trading platform
EBS after falling to the New York low of $1.3365, more than a
cent from the global session peak of $1.3467.
 The euro nevertheless has outperformed the dollar in six of
the past seven sessions, contributing to upbeat outlooks for
the currency shared by 17 nations.
 European shares, meanwhile, hit their highest close in more
than 28 months.
 The euro had earlier gained more than 1 percent against the
dollar after Germany, Europe's largest economy, showed its ZEW
headline economic sentiment indicator surged to its highest
reading in six months, jumping to 15.4 points in January from
4.3 points in December and racing past forecasts for a reading
of 6.8..
 ""The strong ZEW is only adding to positive euro sentiment,""
said Audrey Childe-Freeman, EMEA head of currency strategy at
JPMorgan Private Bank. ""We had a hawkish ECB last week, there
is greater risk appetite and the currency market is rewarding
currencies where they believe interest rates will start to
normalise.""
 Germany's ZEW numbers came less than a week after comments
on inflation from European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet prompted talk that euro zone interest rates could rise
sooner than previously thought.
 Childe-Freeman said there was some optimism that EU leaders
were responding faster than in previous crises, but she said
the euro would face strong resistance at $1.35 until there was
more information on the rescue plan.
 Demand from Middle East accounts and reports Russia was
considering buying euro zone debt lifted the euro, a trader
said.
 Russia's Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said on Tuesday the
country was supportive of the euro zone's efforts to see off a
debt crisis and could buy new bonds from its European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF) rescue fund.
 But he knocked down a newspaper report that Russia, holder
of world's third largest reserves, was ready to resume buying
Spanish debt, which it dropped as an investment after Spain was
downgraded in November..
 The euro's gains helped push the dollar to its weakest in
eight weeks against a basket of currencies at 78.686. It last
traded at 79.061.
 Sustainable euro gains will require additional measures by
EU officials to address the block's deep-rooted debt problems,
according to Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth
Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 ""While the dollar faces continued near-term headwinds as a
result of the recent improvement in market sentiment, its
medium-term outlook remains relatively bright, given recent
signs of improvement in America's recovery and the potential
for credit concerns to remain a drag on the euro,"" he said.
 EURO ZONE FOCUS; STG, CAD GAIN
 European finance ministers agreed on Tuesday to take their
time over strengthening the euro zone's rescue fund and delay
publishing new stress tests on the region's shaky banks until
the second half of the year.,
 ""There are still faultlines, especially pertaining to
issues about the expansion of the rescue fund,"" said Simon
Derrick, head of currency research at Bank of New York Mellon.
""But countries like Russia and China need the euro as a
credible alternative currency.""
 Sterling also hit an eight-week high of $1.6060 after much
higher-than-forecast UK inflation data while the Canadian
dollar hit a two-and-a-half year high of C$0.9837 per U.S.
dollar.

 * Project would use ice-breaking ore carriers
 * Ore's high grade may ease some environmental concerns
 By Allan Dowd
 VANCOUVER, Jan 18 (Reuters) - A truce called in a bidding
war for Canada's Baffinland Iron Mines  sets the stage
for an environmental battle over the Arctic project and the
impact of shipping the ore through ocean ice to world markets.
 The development, on the drawing boards for decades, took a
big step forward last week. ArcelorMittal  and Nunavut
Iron agreed to drop competing bids and extend a joint, C$590
million ($596 million) offer to take control of a project that
could end up costing more than C$4 billion to build.
Baffinland's board has endorsed the joint bid.
 The company, which hopes to have the mine producing by
2014, is expected to file a draft environmental impact study
with territorial and federal regulators in the next few weeks,
government officials say.
 While mining is not new to Canada's Far North, nothing has
been attempted on the scale of Baffinland's Mary River project
on Baffin Island, about 1,000 km (650 miles) northwest of
Iqaluit, the capital of Nunavut territory.
 The mine is thought to have enough high-grade iron ore to
meet Europe's needs for years. But plans to get the ore off the
island include building the North America's northernmost
railroad and bringing in a fleet of ships that can break the
ice year-round.
 The impact of ships cutting through water that's covered
with ice in winter is a concern, said Martin von Mirbach,
Arctic program director at World Wildlife Fund Canada.
 ""It's something that has to be carefully studied,"" said von
Mirbach, saying it has the potential to change life for people
and wildlife in a region that experiences 24-hour darkness in
winter and round-the-clock daylight in summer.
 http://r.reuters.com/cev35r

 For Baffinland factbox [nN14219115]

 Some local Inuit fear year-round ship traffic will disrupt
the migration corridors of wildlife, ranging from polar bears
to beluga whales, as well as their own travel on the ice.
 A 143 km (90 mile) rail line that is expected to handle
three 110-car ore trains a day from the inland mine to a new
port on Steensby Inlet on Baffin Island's western coast has
also raised concern over caribou migration routes.
 Baffinland says in its technical studies that it has
adjusted the proposed ocean shipping route to address local
concerns. But it rejected calls to extend the rail line to a
different coastal area as too costly.
 The company has also said it it might, at least initially,
truck the ore on an existing road to a port at Milne Inlet on
northern Baffin Island, where ore ships would operate for only
a few ice-free months, usually from late May to mid October.
 Using trucks would allow the mine to open more quickly and
cut capital costs. But using the northern port for ore traffic
in the long term has its own environmental concerns, such as
its proximity to the summer habitat for narwhals, a type of
Arctic whale known for its long single tusk.
 ORE DESTINED FOR EUROPE
 The iron-rich ore is targeted for Europe, and von Mirbach
warned that environmental groups would likely get very upset if
owners tried to ship it through the Northwest Passage to
China.
 ""It is a bit unusual in that the mine is just one component
of the project,"" said Ryan Berry, technical services director
of the Nunavut Impact Review Board, which heads up the joint
territorial-federal environmental review process.
 Baffinland wants to build an open pit mine, but it may not
prompt as much environmental concern as similar mining projects
because no chemical processing will take place on site, said
von Mirbach, whose group has not taken a position on the
project.
 Several other Canadian environmental groups acknowledged
they were not paying too close attention to the Mary River
project, in part, because of its remote location.
 Baffinland's proposal comes as Nunavut is completing land
use plans for the territory, and decisions that are made for
the project could affect the entire region for decades.
[ID:nN06150132]
 With a rush of Arctic resource development accelerating,
some are concerned that the interests of the local Inuit
population might get trampled.
 ""We are setting precedents now of how projects go ahead and
so far the trends being set are worrying,"" said Sandra Inutig,
a member of Makita, a Nunavut-based environmental group
monitoring uranium exploration on the region.

 * U.S. seeks to have zeroing recognised in new negotiations
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Jan 18 (Reuters) - A World Trade Organization panel
backed South Korea on Tuesday in a challenge to a controversial
U.S. method for calculating duties on unfairly priced imports,
after the United States offered no defence in the dispute.
 The ruling is the latest in a series of defeats for the
United States over zeroing, a method of calculating anti-dumping
duties that is opposed by all other WTO members.
 The consistent approach by WTO dispute panels and WHO's
appellate body made the U.S. Department of Commerce discontinue
zeroing last month in order to comply with the rulings.
 But U.S. officials say they believe the appellate body has
overstepped its powers in condemning zeroing, and are pushing in
the current Doha round of trade negotiations for zeroing to be
formally recognised. Doha will replace existing rules deriving
from the previous Uruguay round negotiations.
 ""The United States considers that the Uruguay Round
Antidumping Agreement permitted zeroing, and we will work hard
to reaffirm the ability to use this practice through the
negotiations,"" Carol Guthrie, spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade
Representative, told Reuters in a recent comment.
 In the ruling published on Tuesday, the dispute panel backed
the U.S. contention that previous WTO panel and appellate ruling
did not form binding precedents, but still concluded that the
United States had broken trade rules.
 The South Korean case, launched in 2009, involved duties
imposed on stainless steel coils, sheets and strip.
 Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Ecuador, the European Union,
Japan, Mexico and Thailand have also won WTO disputes over
zeroing with the United States.
 WTO rules allow members to impose duties on goods that are
dumped -- sold for less than they cost at home, if that damages
businesses in the importing country.
 Setting anti-dumping duties often involves comparing batches
of goods. In zeroing, the authorities ignore examples where the
imported goods actually cost more than they do at home, which
critics say unfairly inflates the duties.
 Zeroing is controversial even within the United States, as
importers of consumer goods and components say it drives up the
cost of their purchases, while exporters fear they could suffer
retaliation if the United States pursues the policy.

 By Samantha Pearson and Froilan Romero
 SAO PAULO/SANTIAGO, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Latin American
currencies mostly firmed on Tuesday on optimism over the
economic health of the euro zone, which prompted investors to
return to riskier assets worldwide.
 Germany's ZEW investor sentiment index surged as
expectations increased that Europe's powerful export engine
will generate new jobs and investments. For more, see:
[ID:nLDE70H0UU]
 Signs that policymakers will eventually firm up plans to
ease the euro zone's debt crisis [ID:nLDE70H0DQ] also increased
investors' appetite for risk and pushed down the U.S. dollar.
 The Brazilian real  was bid 0.53 percent stronger at
1.672 reais per dollar on the local spot market.
 Expectations that Brazil's central bank will have to raise
interest rates on Wednesday helped the real to outperform the
region. [ID:nSPG003198]
 Brazil has been reluctant to raise its already high
borrowing costs for fear of attracting even more short-term,
speculative money.
 But growing inflation has made such an interest rate hike
seem inevitable. While the consensus among economists and
market participants is for a 50-basis-point rise, the market
has also partially priced in a 75-basis-point increase.
 ""(A) recent surge in food commodity prices -- fueled by
growing inflation fears globally and markets' perception that
central banks have been reluctant to tighten -- could aggravate
the situation further and could further deteriorate inflation
expectations,"" Zeina Latif, chief Brazil economist at RBS in
Sao Paulo, said in a research note.
 The Chilean peso  also firmed, gaining 0.2 percent to
490.20 per dollar as the price of copper, the country's main
export, rose because of the weak dollar. [ID:nLDE70H0DP]
 ""The losses shown by the dollar against the euro are
pushing up the price of raw materials, such as copper. For now,
that's the fundamental reason for the peso's gains,"" said one
currency trader in Santiago.
 However, the Mexican currency  weakened 0.47 percent
to 12.0285 per dollar as investors took profits after the peso
broke the key 12-per-dollar level.

 By Aaron Maasho
 ADDIS ABABA, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Rising infrastructure
investment and agricultural productivity, and a growing demand
for Africa's exports will help the continent's economy expand by
five percent in 2011 and 5.1 in 2012, the United Nations said.
 Falling exports and weak commodity prices slowed the
continent's growth to 2.3 percent in 2009, but improving global
trade enabled Africa to rebound to 4.7 percent in 2010,
according to the United Nation's World Economic Situation and
Prospects report launched in Ethiopia on Tuesday.
 ""The recovery of global trade and the strong economic
rebound in East Asia supported by a strong rebound in Africa's
commodity exports,"" the UN said.
 ""Increased government spending on infrastructure, strong
performance of the agricultural sector and new inflows of
foreign investments in extractive industries underpinned strong
growth in domestic demand,"" the report added.
 However, the UN said the continent's overall growth has

 By Marcin Grajewski and John O'Donnell
 BRUSSELS, Jan 18 (Reuters) - European finance ministers
inched forward on Tuesday towards beefing up the euro zone's
rescue fund and preparing new stress tests for the region's
shaky banks, dashing market hopes of quicker action.
 The sluggish approach could test the patience of investors,
spooked by the euro zone debt crisis, who sold off peripheral
euro zone bonds this month until the European Central Bank
intervened to steady markets.
 Ministers of the 17-nation currency area explored ways to
raise the effective lending capacity of their financial backstop
but reached no conclusion, and they remain locked in dispute on
tougher criteria for checking banks' ability to resist shocks.
 The risk premium on 10-year Portuguese and Irish government
bonds rose as traders took stock of the news, or lack of news,
from Brussels.
 The crisis-fighting measures seem likely to be agreed in a
package deal at a European Union summit on March 24-25, and the
stress test results may not be published until July, sources
from the EU's Hungarian presidency said.
 ""That's a long wait, for Spain particularly, given the cloud
of uncertainty hanging over its banking sector,"" said Kenneth
Wattret, chief euro zone economist at BNP Paribas in London.
 Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager said euro zone
ministers had rejected the idea of increasing outright the
European Finance Stability Facility, meant for euro zone states
shut out of credit markets, from 440 billion euros.
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble accepted that the
full amount earmarked for the EFSF should be available for
lending, rather than the far smaller amount accessible now.
 But he said that would be part of a comprehensive package in
March including stricter budget discipline, structural reforms
and closer economic policy coordination.
 The 440 billion euros was the initial sum agreed to by euro
zone countries when the EFSF was set up in May 2010, but it
later turned out that because of the need to secure a triple-A
credit rating, its effective lending capacity was much smaller.
 Markets want to see more money available for the fund
because they estimate the current amount would not be sufficient
if both Portugal and Spain applied for emergency financing.
 
 LIQUIDITY TESTS
 EU ministers agreed in principle to go beyond last July's
flawed stress tests, which failed to expose Irish banks'
frailty, and conduct tests for liquidity as well as solvency.
 But details of the method, and how much data will be made
public, remain to be agreed, officials said.
 ""We need to learn all the lessons of the first two rounds of
stress tests and we need to make these more robust and more
credible,"" EU Internal Market Commissioner Michel Barnier said.
 Hungarian presidency sources said the new, tougher tests on
banks' ability to withstand financial shocks should be conducted
by the end of May, with results released in July, but other
officials said the timetable had yet to be finalised.
 Schaeuble accepted the principle of testing liquidity, which
Germany has previously resisted, but said it was not yet clear
whether those findings would be made public.
 The tests will encompass many of the same 91 banks as last
year with a tougher methodology, covering both trading and
banking books, and searching tests of core tier 1 capital.
 The new European watchdog said last week it planned
coordinated tests of banks and insurers in the first half of the
year, with conclusions published in mid-2011.
 Euro zone finance ministers explored ways to strengthen the
bloc's bailout funds at their monthly session on Monday evening,
but as expected came to no agreement.
 Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said they discussed
many options, but favoured none. Schaeuble said now markets were
calmer there was no urgency about boosting the EFSF.
 
 GREECE QUASHES RESCHEDULING TALK
 Greece, the first country to receive an EU-IMF bailout last
May, swiftly quashed a suggestion by maverick deputy Prime
Minister Theodore Pangalos that it extend repayments of its
entire outstanding debt.
 Many economists believe Athens will eventually have to
restructure its debt but a Greek government spokesman said
Pangalos had expressed ""a personal, political view"" and Athens
was not discussing extending the repayment of its total debt.
 Juncker said the euro zone ministers discussed in general
terms the possibility of reducing the interest rates charged on
rescue loans to Greece and Ireland, and lengthening the maturity
on Greece's 110 billion euro emergency package.
 That would make up part of the comprehensive package to be
delivered, he said.
 The euro rebounded in European trading, jumping above
$1.3400, after sliding in Asia as hopes were dashed for an
immediate agreement to increase the size of the bailout fund.
 Analysts said they were concerned the euro zone was veering
away from early action now that bond markets were temporarily
calmer following successful debt auctions by Portugal and Spain.
 ""What indications we have heard from European officials over
the past several days is that they just don't feel the same
sense of urgency that the market does,"" said Todd Elmer,
currency strategist at Citi in Singapore.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Investors are more positive about
equities than they have been since July 2007 and have turned
more bearish on bonds, expecting major central banks to keep
rates very low despite stronger economic growth, a survey
showed.
 The monthly global fund managers' survey from Bank of
America-Merrill Lynch showed on Tuesday a net 55 percent of
respondents were overweight equities in January, compared with a
net 40 percent in December.
 This month's reading means the difference between
overweights and underweights is 55 percentage points.
 The poll, which surveyed 199 participants who manage total
assets of $562 billion, also showed bond underweight positions
rose to a net 54 percent, levels not seen since August 2007,
from a net 47 percent last month.
 Cash underweight positions fell to a net 5 percent, compared
with 6 percent last month.
 A net 72 percent of respondents expect higher inflation in
the next 12 months, the highest in almost six years, but have
pushed back expectations for the Federal Reserve's first rise in
interest rates from ultra-low levels until well into 2012.
 ""Investors essentially stopped trying to fight the Fed,
accepting that inflation will be higher but there's no need to
fear rate rises. They are left with almost no choice but to buy
equities and cut cash and bonds,"" said Gary Baker, head of
European equity strategy at BofA Merrill Lynch.
 ""Traditionally alarm bells will go off but there's nothing
to suggest in the survey that investors are over-exuberant.""
 Investors also expected euro zone and Japanese monetary
policies to remain accommodative.
 Average cash holdings rose slightly to 3.7 percent, but
remained below the five-year average of 4.2 percent.
 Emerging markets remained the most favoured region, although
investors have trimmed risks. A net 43 percent of investors were
overweight the asset class, down from a November peak of 56
percent.
 Hedge funds reduced their gearing levels. The ratio of gross
assets held by hedge funds relative to their capital fell to
1.26 this month from 1.48 in December.
 Their net exposure to equity markets -- measured as long
minus short as a percentage of capital -- fell to 31 percent
from 35 last month.
 Regionally, investors turned most optimistic on U.S.
equities since late 2008 with a net 27 percent overweight
position. Japan's allocation shifted to a net 5 percent
overweight from 13 percent underweight in December. 
 Investors boosted their net underweight positions on Europe
to a six-month high of 9 percent from December's 4 percent.
 ""Investors are becoming more positive on the U.S. and Japan
is also benefiting from not being Europe,"" Baker said.

125,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2011 10:44AM ET</span>",BP deal amplifies Kremlin's business message," * BP deal follows image-battering Khodorkovsky trial
 * Kremlin wants to keep business separate from politics
 
 By Steve Gutterman
 MOSCOW, Jan 18 (Reuters) - After a hail of Western criticism
over a new verdict against jailed ex-tycoon Mikhail
Khodorkovsky, Russia's big oil deal with BP Plc sends just the
message the Kremlin wants the world to hear: business is
business.
 State-controlled Rosneft's share swap and Arctic exploration
tie-up with BP will fuel Russia's confidence that it can boost
trade and attract investment without giving ground on domestic
policies viewed with distaste in the West.
 Russia's leaders know the country's creaky economy needs
foreign cash and expertise, and President Dmitry Medvedev has
courted global goodwill by talking up modernisation and reforms
to crucial institutions like the courts and police.
 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin told subordinates late last
year that amid stiff competition to attract investment following
the global financial meltdown, Russia must do better to set
""honest and clear rules"" and cut red tape.
 But the Kremlin has signalled that it is not prepared to woo
Western cash or warmer ties by broadening rights and freedoms,
drawing a line with repeated crackdowns on its opponents.
 ""Russia will not meet the demands of the West,"" said Sergei
Markov, a Kremlin-connected political analyst and lawmaker from
Putin's United Russia party. ""Talk about investment and talk
about democracy have nothing to do with one another.""
 
 WE'VE GOT THE RESERVES
 Russia's energy riches make it a tantalising destination for
foreign companies despite daunting corruption and doubts about
the rule of law -- deepened when a court added six years to
jailed ex-tycoon Khodorkovsky's prison term on Dec 30.
 Sharply criticising the trial, Western governments warned
that Russia would not curb its energy dependence if it failed to
implement the rule of law and push through reforms needed to
modernise the economy.
 Yet despite Mevedev's talk of the need to diversify the
economy away from oil and gas, the BP deal suggests Moscow will
continue to wield its oil wealth as a tool to lure foreign
investment and strengthen its clout worldwide.
 BP's troubles after its Gulf of Mexico spill helped Rosneft
win advantageous terms with a global major that cannot afford to
lose Russian opportunities.
 The Kremlin is likely to pursue more such alliances
worldwide and, in its view, Western concerms about rights and
democracy and Russia must not be a barrier.
 Any attempt to condition security or commercial ties on
compliance with human rights demands is a ""road to nowhere"",
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at an annual news conference
last week meant to set the tone for 2011.
 
 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?
 That is a message Russia has laboured to convey since the
2000-2008 presidency of Putin, accused by the West of
backtracking on democracy and stifling dissent. It could hardly
have come across clearer than it did in the final days of 2010.
 On Dec 30 Khodorkovsky, the long-jailed former Yukos oil
company chief widely seen in the West as a victim of Putin's
Kremlin, was sentenced to stay in prison until late 2017 after a
politically charged theft and money-laundering trial.
 The BP deal is coloured by Khodorkovsky's case because
Rosneft became Russia's largest oil company by snapping up
former Yukos assets after Khodorkovsky's firm was bankrupted by
tax claims following his gunpoint arrest in 2003.
 Khodorkovsky has accused Putin's energy tsar Igor Sechin,
now a deputy prime minister and the Rosneft board chairman, of
engineering his prosecution and the dismantling of Yukos, once
Russia's largest oil producer.
 Britain, the fifth largest source of foreign investment in
Russia, joined other Western nations in criticising the verdict.
Foreign Secretary William Hague said he was ""deeply concerned""
and suggested the trial was a ""retrograde step.""
 But a spokesman for British Prime Minister David Cameron set
the BP-Rosneft agreement apart from long-strained diplomatic
relations on Monday, saying it was ""a commercial deal between
two companies"" with no British government political involvement.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK Jan 18 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar on Tuesday on buying by sovereign funds and strong
German data, with more gains seen as expectations for higher
interest rates assuage fears of fiscal woes on the euro zone
periphery.
 The euro soared more than 1 percent against the dollar
after Germany, Europe's largest economy, showed its ZEW
headline economic sentiment indicator surged to its highest
reading in six months, jumping to 15.4 points in January from
4.3 points in December and racing past forecasts for a reading
of 6.8..
 The euro hit session highs as a move above key technical
levels pointed to further strength in the euro zone single
currency. The euro rose as high as $1.3467 on trading platform
EBS and was last trading up 1.2 percent at $1.3448.
 It rose above a key 100-day simple moving average at around
$1.3423, with traders citing buying by a large Middle East
central bank.
 ""Technically, the outlook for EUR (the euro) is turning
increasingly bullish, with 1.35 an important level of
resistance,"" said Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at
Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 ""Our core view is that EUR will stabilize this quarter and
retrace some of the losses it suffered last fall,"" she said.
 The data helped the euro gain on demand from Middle East
accounts and reports Russia was considering buying euro zone
debt, a trader said.
 JP Morgan Private Bank's Childe-Freeman said there was some
optimism that EU leaders were responding faster than in
previous crises, but she said the euro would face strong
resistance at $1.35 until there was more information on the
rescue plan.
 Russia's Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said on Tuesday
the country was supportive of the euro zone's efforts to see
off a debt crisis and could buy new bonds from its European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) rescue fund.
 But he knocked down a newspaper report that Russia, holder
of world's third largest reserves, was ready to resume buying
Spanish debt, which it dropped as an investment after Spain was
downgraded in November..
 Germany's ZEW numbers came less than a week after comments
on inflation from European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet prompted talk that euro zone interest rates could rise
sooner than previously thought.
 The euro has outperformed the dollar in six of the past
seven sessions, contributing to upbeat outlooks for the
currency shared by 17 nations.
 The euro's gains helped push the dollar to its weakest in
eight weeks against a basket of currencies at 78.686. It last
traded at 78.812.
 U.S. economic data is light side this week, but upcoming
reports on housing starts and existing home sales could sway
the dollar. Earnings reports from key U.S. financial companies
may also influence sentiment.
 EURO ZONE FOCUS; STG, CAD GAIN
 Continued uncertainty over plans to beef up the euro zone's
rescue fund could limit the euro's upside.
 Doubts euro zone policy-makers would reach a quick decision
on enhancing a rescue fund to quell a sovereign debt crisis
remained the euro's Achilles' heel.
 European finance ministers agreed on Tuesday to take their
time over strengthening the euro zone's rescue fund and delay
publishing new stress tests on the region's shaky banks until
the second half of the year.
 ""There are still faultlines, especially pertaining to
issues about the expansion of the rescue fund,"" said Simon
Derrick, head of currency research at Bank of New York Mellon.
""But countries like Russia and China need the euro as a
credible alternative currency.""
 Sterling also hit an eight-week high of $1.6060 after much
higher-than-forecast UK inflation data while the Canadian
dollar hit a two-and-a-half year high of C$0.9837 per U.S.
dollar.
 The Canadian currency was boosted ahead of a Bank of Canada
policy decision at 1400 GMT. Rates are expected to be left at
1.0 percent, but it is expected to raise its forecast for 2011
growth.
 The euro was up 0.70 percent against the yen at 110.72
yen.

 (Adds quotes, detail)
 TULA, Russia, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Russia's interest rates
should not be raised in January as the central bank searches for
the right balance between supporting the economy and cooling
price growth, a member of the bank's board said on Tuesday. 
 ""Disputes are being held every time... If there is my will,
I would not touch rates,"" said Gennady Melikyan, a first deputy
chairman at the central bank.
 Melikyan attends the bank's board meetings where it decides
on interest rates but his main responsibility is for managing
the banking sector not monetary policy.
 Market participants expect the bank to raise rates further
at a meeting in late January after it failed to contain a surge
in inflation to 8.8 percent in 2010, compared with an initial
official target range of 6-7 percent.
 ""Any tightening of monetary policy can reduce capital
outflow, impact inflation but, on the other hand, the tightening
will pressure industrial activity, which in turn will have a
negative impact on inflation,"" Melikyan said.
 ""Moderation is needed in everything,"" he added.
 Alexei Ulyukayev, the first deputy chairman who deals with
monetary policy, said earlier this month that the bank may
continue tightening monetary policy after raising rates in
December due to high inflationary risks. [ID:nLDE70A0PY]
 Melikyan also said the central bank may consider raising
minimum requirements for banks' capital to 300 million roubles
($10 million) from 2015 compared with 90 million roubles at
present.
 The central bank, planning to raise capital requirements to
180 million roubles from 2012, assumes the banks' average
capital will grow by 15 percent a year.
 At present, the overall volume of the Russian banking system
stands at 4.7 trillion roubles ($157.3 billion).

agreed on Tuesday to take their time over beefing up the euro
zone's rescue fund and to publish new stress tests on the
region's shaky banks in the second half of the year.
 The go-slow approach could test the patience of investors,
spooked by the euro zone debt crisis, who sold off peripheral
countries' bonds this month until the European Central Bank
intervened to steady markets.
 Going beyond last July's flawed exercise, which failed to
expose Irish banks' frailty, EU ministers agreed to include
targets on liquidity in new, tougher tests of banks' ability to
withstand financial shocks to be conducted by the end of May,
with results in the third quarter, EU presidency sources said.
 ""The message is that the tests have to be much more
stringent and credible,"" one source said.
 The tests will encompass the same 91 banks with a tougher
methodology, covering not only bank trading books but also
banking books and searching tests of core tier 1 capital.
Germany had previously resisted testing for liquidity.
 New European watchdogs said last week they planned
coordinated tests of banks and insurers in the first half of the
year, with conclusions published in mid-2011.
 Euro zone finance ministers explored ways to strengthen the
17-nation currency zone's financial backstops at their monthly
session on Monday evening, but as expected came to no agreement.
 Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said they discussed
many options, but favoured none.
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said that with
markets calmer there was no rush to boost the European Financial
Stability Facility, and it should be part of a comprehensive
package of reforms adopted by EU leaders in late March.
 ""We want to bring about a comprehensive package and this
naturally means, beyond short-term measures, an improvement of
the Stability and Growth pact and economic coordination,""
Schaeuble told reporters.
 
 GREECE QUASHES RESCHEDULING TALK
 Greece, the first country to receive an EU-IMF bailout last
May, moved swiftly to quash a senior minister's suggestion that
it may seek to reschedule its entire outstanding debt to enable
it to overcome its debt crisis.
 ""I do not believe in haircuts but in extending the repayment
period on debt,"" Deputy Prime Minister Theodore Pangalos, a
maverick whose comments do not always reflect government policy,
told Skai TV late on Monday.
 ""Debt payment extension may refer not only to the 110
billion euros (of emergency funding) but the entire debt,"" he
said. 
 Many economists believe Greece will eventually have to
restructure its debt, but a finance ministry official who
requested anonymity said Athens was not discussing stretching
out repayment of its entire outstanding debt.
 ""The government has a very specific agenda ... there is
preliminary agreement to extend repayment of Greece's EU/IMF
bailout loans and that's it,"" the official said.
 Juncker said the euro zone ministers discussed in general
terms the possibility of reducing the interest rates charged on
rescue loans to Greece and Ireland, and lengthening the maturity
on Greece's 110 billion euro emergency package.
 ""As concerns the lengthening of the Greek maturity, we are
not discussing this in detail as this is part of the
comprehensive package we are supposed to deliver,"" he said.
 The euro rebounded in European trading, jumping above
$1.3400, after sliding in Asia as hopes were dashed for an
immediate agreement to increase the size of the bailout fund.
 Analysts expressed concern that the euro zone was veering
away from early action now that bond markets are temporarily
calmer following successful debt auctions by Portugal and Spain.
 ""What indications we have heard from European officials over
the past several days is that they just don't feel the same
sense of urgency that the market does,"" said Todd Elmer,
currency strategist at Citi in Singapore.
 
 GREATER LENDING POWER
 The EFSF was set up last May after the Greek bailout to help
any other euro zone countries that got shut out of credit
markets. Ireland had to tap the fund in December after its
public debt ballooned following a bank crash due to the bursting
of a real estate bubble.
 The EFSF borrows money on markets with euro zone government
guarantees of up to 440 billion euros. But to obtain the top
credit rating of triple A, the lenders have to set aside cash
reserves effectively reducing the amount the fund can lend to
countries in need to about 250 billion euros.
 Markets want to see more money available for the fund
because they estimate the current amount would not be sufficient
if both Portugal and Spain applied for emergency financing.
 Ministers of the six euro zone countries with a triple A
rating -- Germany, France, the Netherlands, Finland, Austria and
Luxembourg -- held a preliminary meeting on Monday to discuss
how that aim could be achieved.
 ""Obviously it is clear that we have an interest in securing
the (fund's) triple A status and the triple-A states are
therefore positioning themselves such that their voice is heard
in the future,"" Austrian Finance Minister Josef Proell told
reporters.
 Euro zone policymakers are expected eventually to increase
the firepower of the rescue fund by 260 billion euros to reach
700 billion, a Reuters poll shows.
 Last week, the European Commission and the European Central
Bank called not only for the EFSF to have more money but also to
use it in a different way -- for example to buy government bonds
on the secondary market, like the ECB does now.

 * Kurdish oil exports held since 2009

(Updates with govt spokesman)
 By Shamal Aqrawi
 ARBIL, Iraq, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Iraq's semi-autonomous
Kurdish region agreed with Baghdad to resume oil exports at the
start of February, officials said, taking the two sides closer
to resolving bitter disputes over oil and land.
 Around 40 companies, such as Norway's DNO, have invested in
Kurdistan, but revenues have been curtailed by their inability
to sell oil for export, because Baghdad has deemed the contracts
they signed unconstitutional.
 The news of a possible resumption in exports sent shares of
DNO up as much as 6 percent on Tuesday.
 Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh told Reuters on
Tuesday a deal had been reached with the Kurds to resume exports
on Feb. 1, starting at 100,000 barrels per day, but issues like
paying the companies were still to be resolved.
 The office of the Kurdish prime minister, Barham Salih, said
earlier in a statement sent to Reuters the resumption of oil
exports from the region was agreed in a meeting on Monday with
Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.
 Iraq said last May it had approved a deal with the Kurds and
expected Kurdish oil exports to resume quickly. Exports remained
blocked, however, while negotiations over forming a new
government after a March election continued.
 Last year's deal between the central government and the KRG
involved the Ministry of Finance in Baghdad paying foreign oil
firms operating in Iraqi Kurdistan their expenses but not
covering profits.
 Dabbagh said all issues related to the Kurdish contracts
signed with international oil firms working in the region, and
how the companies will be paid, will be discussed later.
 ""We have agreed... to discuss the issue of the region's
contracts at a later stage within the constitutional framework,""
he said, when asked about the terms of the deal.
 The statement from Salih's office said the deal on oil was
part of a broader agreement to resolve all outstanding issues
between Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG).
 One of the other issues is the inclusion in Iraq's draft
budget for 2011 of a clause cutting the funds paid to the KRG if
it does not export an average of 150,000 barrels per day this
year. The budget has not been approved yet by parliament, and
the proposed clause drove Kurdish lawmakers to walk out in
protest on its first reading last month.
 If oil exports resume from the Kurdish region, flows would
be about 100,000 bpd and could reach 250,000 bpd by the end of
the year, Kurdish Natural Resources Minister Ashti Hawrami has
said.
 Kurdish exports from two fields -- Taq Taq and Tawke --
flowed briefly in 2009 but were halted when the Iraqi government
refused to pay the oil companies working the fields, including
DNO and Turkey's Genel Enerji.
 DNO stands ready to export around 50,000 bpd if a deal is
concluded. Currently it is confined to selling around 17,000 bpd
to the local Kurdish market, where it receives less than half
the international price for its oil.
 Other companies including London-listed Gulf Keystone,
Heritage Oil and Genel have also made large discoveries in the
region.
 
 LOGGERHEADS
 The Oil Ministry in Baghdad has opposed independent deals
signed between the companies and the KRG authorities,
considering them illegal.
 Iraqi Kurdistan and Baghdad have been at loggerheads over
many thorny issues, which U.S. officials fear could be the spark
of Iraq's next major conflict just as the sectarian bloodshed
fades and as U.S. troops prepare to withdraw this year.
 At the heart of the tensions lie disputed territories
including the oil city of Kirkuk, which Kurds want to have
wrapped into their northern region.
 Iraq exports the majority of its oil from its southern
fields around the city of Basra at an average of more than 1.5
million bpd now. Oil from the Kirkuk fields provides another
400,000 bpd or so in exports.
 Baghdad's hand against the Kurds has been strengthened by a
series of oil deals involving fields outside the Kurdish region,
which could turn Iraq into one of the world's top crude
exporters.
 The deals could boost Iraq's output potential to 12 million
barrels per day in seven years from around 2.7 million bpd now.

 * Sterling hits 8-wk high vs dlr after inflation data

(Releads, adds quote, details)
 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Tuesday on
buying by sovereign funds and after an influential German survey
pointed to robust growth in Europe's largest economy, pushing
euro zone debt concerns into the background.
 The euro rose more than 1.0 percent at $1.3430, extending
earlier gains made on demand from Middle East accounts and
reports that Russia was considering buying euro zone debt.
 The ZEW's headline economic sentiment indicator surged to
15.4 points in January from 4.3 points in December, racing past
forecasts for a reading of 6.8..
 The number came less than a week after hawkish comments on
inflation from European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet and triggered buying of the single currency.
 ""Coming on a day when the euro had already put in a solid
performance, these blockbuster numbers just add to the euro's
flavour,"" said Simon Derrick, head of currency research at Bank
of New York Mellon.
 ""There are still faultlines, especially pertaining to issues
about the expansion of the rescue fund,"" he added. ""But
countries like Russia and China need the euro as a credible
alternative currency. We are seeing a slight shift in sentiment
towards the euro.""
 Russia's Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said on Tuesday the
country was supportive of the euro zone's efforts to see off a
debt crisis and could buy new bonds from its European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF) rescue fund.
 But he knocked down a newspaper report that Russia, holder
of world's third largest reserves, was ready to resume buying
Spanish bonds, which it dropped as an investment after Spain was
downgraded in November, saying the paper was still too risky.
 The newspaper report had been seen as positive for the euro,
coming just weeks after Asian powerhouses China and Japan both
pledged to invest in euro zone and peripheral debt, while
Kudrin's comments on the EFSF and euro zone were also welcomed.
 The bailout fund plans to sell a five-year bond of up to 5
billion euros next week as part of its financial assistance
programme for Ireland.
 
 RESCUE FUND EXPANSIION IS KEY
 Doubts that euro zone policymakers would reach a quick
decision on whether to enhance a rescue fund aimed at quelling a
sovereign debt crisis remained the euro's Achilles' heel.
 Euro zone finance ministers met on Monday but made no firm
decision about possible additional crisis measures, turning
market attention to the Ecofin meeting of European Union finance
ministers due to be held later on Tuesday.
 ""What indications we have heard from European officials over
the past several days is that they just don't feel the same
sense of urgency that the market does,"" said Todd Elmer,
currency strategist with Citi in Singapore.
 ""I think for the time being that means the euro is likely to
trade lower,"" Elmer said, adding the single currency could dip
back towards $1.30 in coming weeks.
 European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli
Rehn held out hope for the effective lending capacity of the
EFSF rescue fund to be expanded, saying he was confident of such
an outcome.
 Analysts say a new package of measures to tackle the crisis
is both essential and urgent.
 The euro was up 0.35 percent against the yen at 110.53 yen
and 0.25 percent higher on the Swiss franc.
 It also rose against sterling, after easing on
higher-than-expected UK inflation numbers. Those numbers drove
the pound to an eight-week high versus the U.S. dollar, as the
data added to expectations that UK interest rates may need to
rise sooner than had been expected.

 * OAIC refuses to comment
 * Algeria aims to cover months to August, when start harvest
 
 (Corrects period of purchases to 2 weeks from 2 months)
 By Lamine Chikhi
 ALGIERS, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Algeria's state grains agency
has purchased around 1 million tonnes of wheat in the past two
weeks to avoid shortages in case of unrest, a source from the
ministry of agriculture told Reuters.
 The OAIC's director, Nouredine Kahel, refused to make any
comment, but a source at the ministry said that there are three
main reasons behind Algeria's decision to buy big quantities in
a short period of time.
 ""One is that we want to make sure that we do have enough
wheat in case of unrest,"" the source, who asked not to be named,
told Reuters.
 Several Algerian towns including the capital experienced
days of rioting earlier this month, triggered by a sharp rise in
food prices. Two people were killed and hundreds were injured
during clashes between rioters and police, officials said.
 To calm the situation, Algeria has decided to cut the cost
of some foodstuffs and to increase by 18 percent the amount of
soft wheat it supplies to the local market each month.
 ""This is the second reason behind Algeria's decision to buy
big quantities of wheat,"" the source said.
 The amount of soft wheat the OAIC agency supplies to
processors will go up from 350,000 tonnes to 430,000 tonnes per
month from Jan. 9 until Aug. 31, according to officials.
 ""The third reason is that we need to cover the period from
March to June as the upcoming harvest will only be available in
August,"" the source said.
 Algeria, the world's fifth-biggest cereals importer has
launched a plan in 2008 to reduce its dependency over imports.

(Adds ZEW and Berenberg economists, euro reaction) 
 By Sakari Suoninen and Josie Cox
 MANNHEIM, Germany, Jan 18 (Reuters) - German investors are
increasingly optimistic about the economy and half expect higher
interest rates by July, a survey showed, highlighting the
two-speed euro zone recovery and the dilemma it creates for the
ECB.
 The Mannheim-based ZEW think tank said sentiment surged in
January, reflecting growing confidence that Germany's
traditionally export-focused industrial sector will create new
jobs and investments this year to spur further robust growth
while also boosting demand at home.
 Published less than a week after comments on inflation from
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet prompted
talk of possible rate hikes, the survey found about 50 percent
of investors expect an ECB tightening within six months, a few
months earlier than markets are currently pricing in.
 Foreign exchange markets seized on the data, bidding up
the euro and selling the dollar although the single currency
later gave up some of its gains to trade back around the $1.34
mark.
 Thomas Straubhaar, head of Hamburg-based HWWI economic
research institute, told Reuters the ECB should not wait too
long before raising its main lending rate.
 ""An interest rate hike would be right for Germany to prevent
the inflation genie from getting out of the bottle,"" he said.
 But ZEW economist Michael Schroeder told reporters on
Tuesday that widening divergences would place ECB policymakers
in a tight spot as rates are too low for Germany and too high
for ailing euro zone states like Greece and Ireland.
 ECB rate-setter Athanasios Orphanides said on Monday
Trichet's policy statement had not been ""overly hawkish"" and
that markets sometimes over-reacted to the bank's underlying
message.
 
 INFLATION
 ""We have a strong divide in macroeconomic developments and I
don't know how the ECB can make it right for everyone,""
Schroeder said, adding that most investors expect a pick-up in
inflation over the coming six months.
 Inflation concerns took centre stage on Tuesday in Britain,
where consumer prices surged by a greater than expected 3.7
percent in December, piling pressure on the Bank of England to
raise interest rates despite slow growth and looming austerity
measures. 
 The ZEW's monthly index jumped to 15.4 points from a reading
of 4.3 in December, its highest level since last July and easily
surpassing the consensus forecast of 6.8 points in a Reuters
poll of 36 economists.
 ""The German economy is cruising along safely. It looks as if
there is almost blind trust in the strength of the German
recovery,"" said ING Financial Markets economist Carsten Brzeski.
 In contrast to the ZEW survey, a Reuters poll on Monday
showed that although economists feel the chances of an earlier
rate move have increased, most still expect the ECB to hold them
until late this year. 
 While January's ZEW is impressive relative to expectations,
Berenberg Bank Chief Economist Holger Schmieding said it should
be seen in the context of last April's peak of 53.0 that was
followed by a six-month plunge to minus 7.2 in October.
 ""Investors are finally beginning to get beyond their
exaggerated concerns over a dent to exports from euro zone
fiscal tightening and a potential U.S. double dip,"" he said.
 
 POINTER TO IFO?
 The ZEW precedes Friday's Ifo index, which is considered to
be the most reliable sentiment gauge when predicting changes in
domestic output.
 Germany has been among the most resilient of Western
industrialised economies in the past year thanks to a strong
export sector that supplies dynamic emerging markets with the
goods needed to improve infrastructure and boost productivity.
 Europe's largest economy expanded at the fastest pace since
reunification in 2010 and forecasters like M.M. Warburg Chief
Economist Carsten Klude believe it could grow at more than 3
percent for the second straight year.
 Years of wage restraint paired with a weak euro has ushered
in what some experts believe will be a decade of above-average
growth for Germany, once overall household consumption starts to
improve on the back of record high employment levels.
 The country's relative prosperity, however, has triggered
tensions among other countries using the euro that feel Germany
has unfairly kept a lid on wages at the cost of internal demand
that could spur greater imports and growth elsewhere.
 On Monday, euro zone finance ministers met in Brussels to
discuss whether to beef up the euro area's rescue fund as Athens
distanced itself from one cabinet minister who called for a de
facto restructuring of its debt obligations.
 The ZEW's monthly index was based on a survey of 284
analysts and investors and conducted between Jan. 3 and Jan. 17.

 By Sarah Marsh and Daniel Flynn
 BRUSSELS, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers
have decided to take their time over beefing up the currency
area's rescue fund as debt-stricken Greece denied a minister's
comment that it should stretch out all its debt repayments.
 The 17 euro zone ministers showed no indications they were
closing in on any firm decisions after their monthly meeting on
Monday. The chairman of euro zone finance ministers, Jean-Claude
Juncker, said they discussed many options, but favoured none.
 Germany, the biggest euro zone economy that is key to any
agreement on changes, said there was no rush to boost the
European Financial Stability Facility since bond markets were
calmer and an overall package should be prepared for late March.
 ""Market developments in the last week have, thank God, taken
the urgency out of these discussions,"" German Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble said.
 Greece, the first country to receive an EU-IMF bailout last

to reschedule its entire outstanding debt to enable it to
overcome its debt crisis.

help any other euro zone countries that got shut out of credit

public debt ballooned following a bank crash due to the bursting
of a real estate bubble.

countries in need to about 250 billion euros.
 Markets want to see more money available for the fund

if both Portugal and Spain applied for emergency financing.
 Schaeuble acknowledged that the effective lending capacity
of the EFSF would have to be increased but said it would have to
be part of a package of measures to be adopted in March.
 Ministers of the six euro zone countries with a triple A
rating -- Germany, France, the Netherlands, Finland, Austria and
Luxembourg -- held a separate meeting on Monday, diplomats said,
but there was no public indication of the outcome.
 Euro zone policymakers are expected eventually to increase
the firepower of the rescue fund by 260 billion euros to reach
700 billion, a Reuters poll shows.
 Last week, the European Commission and the European Central
Bank called not only for the EFSF to have more money but also to
use it in a different way -- for example to buy government bonds
on the secondary market, like the ECB does now.
 Germany has so far opposed the idea and Juncker would not
give any details on what support that idea had among euro zone
finance ministers on Monday.
 
 BELGIUM THE LATEST TEST
 Belgium provides the latest test of investor sentiment over
euro zone debt on Tuesday with an issue of three-month and
12-month treasury certificates.
 The country was largely untouched by the euro zone's debt
crisis until November, when contagion concerns grew.
 The lack of a government for seven months is feeding market
fears political paralysis will undermine efforts to cut a public
sector debt that is almost as large as annual economic output.
 Bolstering market sentiment, the ECB said on Monday it
bought 2.3 billion euros in euro zone government bonds last
week, its biggest weekly purchase for more than a month. The
buying helped calm markets, enabling Spain and Portugal to stage
successful auctions.
Madrid cancelled a planned bond auction on Monday and decided
instead on a 10-year bond sale through a syndicate of banks, to
raise 6 billion euros.

 * Wall Street set to open higher
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, Europe Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - - World stocks hit a fresh
28-month high on Tuesday, while the euro climbed on new evidence
of robust growth in Germany and signs that policymakers will
eventually firm up plans to ease the euro zone's debt crisis.
 Wall Street looked set to open higher, adding to its
relatively solid start to the year.
 European finance ministers agreed on Tuesday to take their
time over beefing up a rescue fund for indebted euro zone
countries and delay publishing new stress tests on the region's
shaky banks until the second half of the year.
 Russia, however, said it may be interested in buying bonds
from the fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).
 The euro rose at one point more than 1 percent against the
dollar and was later up 0.8 percent, above $1.34.
 Germany's ZEW investor sentiment index surged for the month
as expectations increased that Europe's biggest economy's
powerful export engine will generate new jobs and investments.
 Investors, however, remain keen to see euro zone countries
provide more money for the EFSF to ensure that there is enough
to cover any contagion into large economies such as Spain.
 Analysts in a Reuters poll expected euro zone policymakers
to increase the firepower of the EFSF by 260 billion euros to
reach 700 billion euros.
 It appeared, however, that EU ministers would not come up
with a new package until leaders' meetings in February or even
March. Investors have nonetheless been stepping back from their
worst case scenarios vis-a-vis the crisis.
 ""Players are not too keen to push the euro much lower,"" said
Paul Mackel, director of currency strategy at HSBC. ""I am not
too sure if it has the legs to test recent highs given all the
uncertainty surrounding talks on the euro zone safety fund.""
 Euro zone government bonds sold off slightly, lifting
yields.
 
 NEW HIGHS
 World stock markets, meanwhile, focused on broader signs of
an improved outlook for global economic growth and positive
earnings reports.
 MSCI's all-country world index touched levels last seen in
late August 2008. It was up 0.6 percent on the day.
 Developed markets outperformed emerging bourses, continuing
recent trends. Attention has shifted among some investors
towards recovering developed economies and away from emerging
markets, which are seen as a slightly crowded trade.
 Goldman Sachs told an investor conference on Monday, for
example, that it expected U.S. and Japanese stocks to outperform
in the first half of 2011, with European and emerging stocks
taking over in the second.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 was up more than 1 percent at 28-month
highs with mining stocks leading the way.
 ""The markets are waiting for an opportunity to move ahead
rather than looking for an opportunity to take profits,"" said
Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin.
 ""The backdrop is still very supportive. This week is a very
big week for corporate earnings in the U.S. and on balance, the
results should be quite good.""
 Japan's Nikkei earlier closed up 0.15 percent.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Tuesday on
buying by sovereign funds and reports that Russia may resume
buying Spanish debt, although uncertainty whether the size of a
euro zone rescue fund will be increased checked gains.
 The euro was up 0.7 percent at $1.3381, extending earlier
gains on demand from Middle East accounts and after a Spanish
daily reported Russia may revise its policy on investing in
Spanish bonds after it suspended investments in 2010..
 Russia's Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said the country may
be interested in buying bonds from the euro zone's European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). But it is not ready to buy
Spanish sovereign bonds with its oil wealth fund, Kudrin said.
 The EFSF, the euro zone's sovereign bailout fund, plans to
sell a five-year bond of up to 5 billion euros next week as part
of its financial assistance programme for Ireland.
 Kudrin's comments and the newspaper report were seen as
short-term positives for the euro, as they come just weeks after
Asian powerhouses China and Japan both pledged to invest in euro
zone and peripheral debt.
 ""Players are not too keen to push the euro much lower. The
reports that Russians are considering buying Spanish debt is
constructive for the euro in the short term,"" said Paul Mackel,
director of currency strategy at HSBC.
 ""I am not too sure if it has the legs to test recent highs
given all the uncertainty surrounding talks on the euro zone
safety fund.""
 Near term resistance for the single currency is seen near
its 100-day moving average which comes in at $1.3423. Chartists
say the euro's recent failure to break above its mid-December
peak of $1.3500 suggests it may remain stuck in its range of
$1.3500 to $1.2860.
 Doubts that euro zone policymakers would reach a quick
decision on whether to enhance a rescue fund aimed at quelling a
sovereign debt crisis that has forced Greece and Ireland to take
bailouts and put nations such as Portugal and Spain under heavy
pressure, remained the euro's Achilles' heel.
 
 PLENTY OF EVENT RISKS
 Euro zone finance ministers met on Monday but made no firm
decision about possible additional crisis measures, turning
market attention to the Ecofin meeting of European Union finance
ministers due to be held later on Tuesday.
 ""What indications we have heard from European officials over
the past several days is that they just don't feel the same
sense of urgency that the market does,"" said Todd Elmer,
currency strategist with Citi in Singapore.
 ""I think for the time being that means the euro is likely to
trade lower,"" Elmer said, adding that the euro could dip back
towards $1.30 in coming weeks.
 Europe's safety net fund can borrow on the market with euro
zone government guarantees of up to 440 billion euros, but
analysts say a new package of measures to tackle the crisis is
both essential and urgent.
 European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli
Rehn held out hope for the effective lending capacity of the
European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) rescue fund to be
expanded, saying he was confident of such an outcome.
 Another factor that could influence the euro is the German
ZEW survey for January and the UK inflation data for December.
 The euro was up 0.35 percent against the yen and 0.1 percent
against both sterling and the Swiss franc.
 The dollar dipped 0.25 percent against the yen to 82.57 yen
while the dollar index was down 0.5 percent at 78.92.
 The Canadian dollar hit 2-1/2 year high of C$0.9837 against
the U.S. dollar, helped by higher commodity prices and more
optimistic signs in the U.S. The Bank of Canada is expected to
keep interest rates steady later in the day at 1 percent, but is
likely to move in May.

 * Regulator sees speculative inflows on yuan expectations
 * To continue yuan convertibility over the next five years
 BEIJING, Jan 18 (Reuters) - China faces growing challenges in
managing its foreign exchange reserves -- the world's largest at
$2.85 trillion, the country's foreign exchange regulator said in
remarks published on Tuesday.
 The comments by Yi Gang, head of the State Administration of
Foreign Exchange (SAFE), highlighted official concerns over the
rapid build-up in the country's foreign currency reserves, which
jumped by a record $199 billion in the fourth quarter.
 ""The management of large foreign exchange reserves is
restricted not only by market sizes but also the attitude of
invested countries,"" Yi said in comments published on the
regulator's website: www.safe.gov.cn.
 China has been working for years to diversify its official
currency reserves to reduce the dominance of U.S. Treasuries in
its holdings of foreign assets.
 But the diversification has not been smooth.
 Investment of euro assets has been overshadowed by the debt
crisis, and volatility in the value of the euro, while the
attention China drew last year for buying Japanese and South
Korean debt underscored the difficulties in investing in other
smaller government debt markets.
 The rise in China's reserves was fuelled by hot money inflows
into the world's second-largest economy due to expectations for a
stronger yuan, Yi said.
 ""As China's economy has recovered with growing macro-economic
strength, together with an interest rate gap, yuan appreciation
expectations and other factors, small 'hot money' inflows through
trade and investment should not be ruled out.""
 Economists suspect that much of the increase in FX reserves
could not be explained by trade or direct foreign investment,
implying that speculative inflows had picked up towards the end
of the year.
 China will gradually push ahead the free convertibility of
the yuan on the capital account under its 12th five-year plan,
but it will continue to clamp down on cross-boarder abnormal
capital inflows in the coming five years, Yi said.
 ""We will further improve the risk-alert system in tackling
abnormal cross-boarder capital inflows and stand firmly to
safeguard the national financial security,"" he said.

 * Single regional exchange for financial products
 * Consolidation likely in two to three years
 
 By Michael Kahn and Patryk Wasilewski
 PRAGUE/WARSAW, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Consolidation looms for
Central Europe's four power exchanges as they fight for a
limited volume of trades, while traders want one regional bourse
with easier access and greater liquidity.
 Over the past three years, rival bourses have started
operations in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland to trade
spot power and derivatives, hoping to tap into a potentially
lucrative market in a region with good grid connections and
scope for prices to rise.
 Most contracts are for physical delivery, but the goal for
many bourses and traders is to one day offer financially settled
trades throughout the region from a single hub.
 ""Currently none of the national markets can offer optimal
economies of scale, similar to liquid western ones.
Consolidation will come in two to three years,"" Zoltan
Medveczki, head of Hungary's HUPX exchange, said in an
interview.
 So far, competition appears to have taken centre stage over
efforts to establish a single exchange.
 David Kucera, head of the Prague-based Power Exchange
Central Europe (PXE), whose Hungarian operations took a hit when
HUPX opened last summer, said unreasonable expectations about
market potential have attracted new entrants.
 ""There will be a consolidation process -- exchanges will be
merging or closing their services,"" Kucera said in an interview.
 ""Competition is good in any sector. However, I have a
feeling we are facing unreasonable fragmentation of the market
now,"" he added.
 One solution could be for one bourse in each country to
operate a local spot physical market that offers one fixing a
day and deliveries of up to three months, Frank Brannvoll, head
of illiquid markets at GDF Suez, said in a recent interview.
 But there should also be a single regional, easily
accessible exchange for trading energy derivatives for periods
from three months to five years based on the indexes of the
national exchanges, he added.
 Even taking the spot market into account, ""the CEE markets
are not yet big enough to support more than one power exchange
per country,"" HUPX's Medveczki said.
 And for many of these bourses, operating only a spot market
in a single country would probably not be worth their while to
stay in business.
 
 ADVANTAGES OF ONE EXCHANGE
 The creation of a single Central European power derivatives
exchange, meanwhile, would probably boost liquidity. Banks and
funds could more easily access one market than four with four
separate sets of rules.
 These financial players also have no need to deal with
scheduling of physical deliveries, Brannvoll said.
 Without ""a much more coordinated approach from exchanges to
secure a well functioning easy accessible market"", the region's
power markets will be slower to develop, he said.
 A regional exchange would clear away the kinds of hurdles
traders face in places such as Poland, where they say a new
energy law has translated into higher costs and obstacles to
enter the market.
 It could also mark a step toward European Union goals of
more central trading.
 ""Looking at the market from a perspective of a few years, it
is clear it should be consolidated, with a need for only one
platform to trade energy,"" said Ludwik Sobolewski, chief
executive of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, which started trading in
energy in December to compete with POLPX.
 Dariusz Lubera, who heads Polish utility Tauron, said his
company was active on both exchanges but predicted that only one
would survive in the future.
 ""There is no chance that both of these exchanges will
survive; there is not enough liquidity,"" Lubera said.

 * G20 president also seeks improved oil data in JODI system
 * France wants commodity regulation in physical,futures mkts
 * Paris blames speculation for surge in commodity prices
 
 By Emmanuel Jarry
 PARIS, Jan 18 (Reuters) - France is pushing for an enlarged
role for the United Nations' Food and Agriculture agency to help
tackle market tensions that are fuelling high commodity prices
and social unrest for the second time in three years.
French authorities have been promoting greater regulation of
commodity markets as a cornerstone of their presidency of the
Group of 20 economies in 2011.
 A revamped FAO, with more reliable data at its disposal and
the power to coordinate trade measures between countries, is
among proposals being discussed, sources at the French
presidential palace said.
 The Rome-based FAO already collects data on farm output and
food prices, and its announcement earlier this month that its
global price index hit a record high in December stoked fears
about a global food crisis as seen in 2008.
 The surge in agricultural markets such as wheat and sugar
has fuelled protests in parts of North Africa and the Middle
East, and countries such as Algeria have resorted to extra
imports and subsidies as they seek to avert the kind of popular
revolt that has swept Tunisia's longstanding leader from power.
 The FAO and other observers see scope for prices to rise
further this year because of adverse weather in major grain
exporters including Argentina, Russia and Australia.
 ""We need an organisation that offers accurate information
and a forum for discussion between producers and consumers,"" a
source close to the French president's office said. ""This would
be a reformed FAO rather than a new organisation. It's simpler
to build on what exists already.""
 
 PHYSICAL AND FUTURES MARKETS
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy floated in November the
idea of a body to coordinate world agricultural output, without
specifying if he meant the FAO.
 France argues that a lack of precise data on farm output and
stocks around the world has contributed to volatility and that
the FAO in its current form is hampered by limited information.
 Dialogue under the aegis of the FAO could avert the kind of
market upheaval that followed Russia's suspension of grain
exports in August after a drought devastated crops, French
officials added.
 The G20 presidency is also aiming to improve supply and
demand data in oil markets as published through the Joint Oil
Data Initiative (JODI), officials said.
 France's foreign trade minister is due to discuss the issue
at a conference in Saudi Arabia on Jan. 24, the same day that
President Sarkozy will formally launch France's G20 presidency.
 In parallel with its push for transparency in physical
markets, France is continuing to back greater oversight in
commodity derivatives and is taking its lead from measures being
debated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
 France has blamed financial speculation in commodity markets
for contributing to soaring prices, although analysts are
divided over whether this is as significant as fundamentals.
French Agriculture Minister Bruno Le Maire is planning to
gather his counterparts from other G20 countries for a farm
conference in May or June, ahead of a meeting of G20 leaders in
November that will close the French presidency of the group.

 * Focus still on euro zone rescue plan
 * Support for euro seen near $1.3230
 By Ian Chua and Masayuki Kitano
 SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The euro edged higher
against the dollar on Tuesday as the arrest of a slide in
Chinese shares boosted risk appetite, but its gains were limited
by uncertainty over whether officials will agree to beef up a
euro zone safety fund this week.
 The euro dipped initially but later pared its losses against
the dollar as Chinese shares showed signs of stabilising
<.SSEC> after the previous day's 3 percent slide, lending some
support to risky assets.
 The euro's rise against the dollar picked up some steam on
stop-loss buying, helping push the single European currency 0.1
percent higher on the day to $1.3305 , up from an intraday
low of $1.3254.
 But doubts that euro zone policymakers would reach a quick
decision on whether to enhance a rescue fund aimed at quelling a
sovereign debt crisis, which has forced Greece and Ireland to
take bailouts and put nations such as Portugal and Spain under
heavy pressure, remained the euro's Achilles' heel.

 The euro's recent failure to break above its

may remain stuck in its range seen over the past month of
$1.3500 to $1.2860.
 ""Although there have been some wild ups and downs, when you
think about it, the euro has not really been able to break out
of a range roughly between $1.3 to $1.35,"" said a trader for a
major Japanese bank in Singapore.
 ""I don't think you can make any definitive assumptions,"" the
trader said, referring to the euro's near-term direction.

 By Sarah Marsh and Daniel Flynn
 BRUSSELS, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Investors showed growing
scepticism on Tuesday that euro zone finance ministers will
thrash out an agreement soon to beef up a rescue fund as part of
measures to end the region's sovereign debt crisis.
 The ministers showed no indications they were closing in on
any firm decisions on Monday. The chairman of euro zone finance
ministers, Jean-Claude Juncker, said they discussed many
options, but favoured none.
 In response, the euro  fell broadly as hopes faded for
an immediate agreement to increase the size of the bailout fund
and the currency continued to slide in Asian trade on Tuesday.
[ID:nTOE70H027]
 Germany, the biggest euro zone economy that is key to any
agreement on changes, has indicated no rush to take action
especially since bond markets are calmer following successful
debt auctions by Portugal and Spain.

 Stories on euro zone crisis [ID:nTOPEURO]
 Comments by EU officials, finance ministers [ID:nLDE70G298]
 
 The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) was set up
in May 2010 to borrow money on markets with euro zone government
guarantees of up to 440 billion euros.
 But because it wants to have the top credit rating of triple
A, the effective amount the fund can lend to countries in need
is around 250 billion euros.
 Both Greece and Ireland have been bailed out during the debt
crisis and markets are worried that Portugal and possibly Spain
could be next.
 Markets want to see more money available for the fund
because they estimate the current amount would not be sufficient
if both Portugal and Spain applied for emergency financing.
 Euro zone policymakers are expected eventually to increase
the firepower of the EFSF by 260 billion euros to reach 700
billion, a Reuters poll shows. [ID:nLDE70G0NA]
 Last week, the European Commission and the European Central
Bank called not only for the EFSF to have more money but also to
use it in a different way -- for example to buy government bonds
on the secondary market, like the ECB does now.
Germany has so far opposed the idea and Juncker would not
give any details on what support that idea had among euro zone
finance ministers on Monday.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said there was no
need to increase the size of the rescue fund at this point.
 ""Portugal doesn't want or need a bailout at all. There's
enough funds for Ireland and the rest is speculation that is not
being stirred up by anyone,"" he told German radio on Monday
ahead of the finance ministers' talks.[ID:nLDE70G0C3]
 Juncker vowed to accelerate work on the package, but was
careful not to commit to being ready in time for the Feb. 4 or
March 24-25 European Union leaders' summits.
""I wouldn't give a date for conclusion of our work, but the
work will be done at the highest speed possible,"" Juncker said.
 BELGIUM THE LATEST TEST
 The euro fell as low as $1.3250 in Asian trade on Tuesday
before finding some support and bouncing up to around $1.3315 at
0530 GMT.
 Still, that was well below a one-month high of $1.3458 on
Friday before the currency started to slide ahead of the euro
zone talks.
 U.S. Treasuries firmed in Asia, after a market holiday on
Monday, drawing some support from waning hopes for a quick deal
to bolster the rescue fund. [ID:nTOE66S064]
 Belgium provides the latest test of investor sentiment over
euro zone debt on Tuesday with an issue of three-month and
12-month treasury certificates.
 The country was largely untouched by the euro zone's debt
crisis until November, when contagion concerns grew.
 The lack of a government for seven months is feeding market
fears political paralysis will undermine efforts to cut a public
sector debt that is almost as large as annual economic output.
 Bolstering market sentiment, the ECB said on Monday it
bought 2.3 billion euros in euro zone government bonds last
week, its biggest weekly purchase for more than a month. The
buying helped calm markets, enabling Spain and Portugal to stage
successful auctions.
Madrid cancelled another planned bond auction on Monday and
decided instead on a 10-year bond sale through a syndicate of
banks, to raise 6 billion euros.

 * U.S. eyes China's relationship with Iran
 By Patricia Zengerle
 WASHINGTON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama
will host Chinese President Hu Jintao for a state visit on
Tuesday in a crucial summit of the world's two biggest powers
that some analysts have called the most important since Deng
Xiaoping's visit 30 years ago.
 Here are some questions and answers about issues causing
tensions between the two countries, which are competitors but
also partners:
 WHAT IS THE MAIN SOURCE OF TENSION?
 Economic issues will loom large at the summit and are a
source of both deepening ties and friction.
 The ballooning U.S. trade deficit with China is expected to
hit $270 billion this year. The two countries blame each other
for causing problems in international commerce.
 Washington complains that Beijing keeps its yuan currency
too cheap, giving it an unfair advantage in trade, and Obama
has warned China against relying too heavily on exports for
growth. Chinese officials say U.S. easy-money policy is aimed
at weakening the dollar to boost exports and have said yuan
appreciation would do little to alleviate the trade gap. Some
U.S. politicians have pushed for a law to punish Beijing if it
does not revalue the yuan.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner began a new tack
on the issue last week by saying it would be in China's own
interest to let the yuan's value rise more rapidly in order to
tamp down inflation in its own economy.
 A group of U.S. senators said on Monday the time had come
for U.S. congressional action on China's currency policies.
 Hu wants assurances for his workers and export industries
that American markets will remain open to Chinese goods, said
David Lampton, director of China Studies at Johns Hopkins
University's School of Advanced International Studies.
 ""Washington would like China to move more decisively to
rebalance its economy, reducing reliance on exports,"" Lampton
said, adding that China is not expected to move as quickly as
Washington would like.
 Beijing is the biggest single holder of U.S. Treasuries,
with about $900 billion. Some in Washington have feared China
could dump the bonds because of a political dispute but that is
seen as counterproductive to China's economic interests and
considered unlikely.
 WHAT IS THE TOUCHIEST DIPLOMATIC ISSUE?
 The United States has been pushing China, North Korea's
only major ally and financial backer, for more help persuading
Pyongyang to abandon nuclear weapons and avoid potentially
destabilizing actions like the North's bombarding of a South
Korean island two months ago and the sinking of a South Korean
navy ship that killed 46 sailors in March.
 China, concerned with stability on the Korean peninsula,
wanted Washington to ease its stance that it would not engage
in negotiations again without North Korean concessions and head
back toward talks. Beijing and Washington had been at
loggerheads on the issue but Pyongyang's hostile actions and
signs it is advancing its nuclear program have driven home the
point in both capitals that it is better to talk than
otherwise.
 ""At this juncture, we seem to have found some common ground
with the Chinese going forward on a path that would take us
back to the six-party talks,"" said Bonnie Glaser, a China
expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington.
 WHAT ABOUT THE COUNTRIES' IMAGES?
 Chinese officials worry that the United States is fostering
relations with other countries in Asia to counter China's
growing influence in the region.
 Chinese leaders also are concerned about the extent to
which their country is viewed with hostility in the United
States, with politicians accusing China of pilfering U.S. jobs
by suppressing its currency and rigging its economy to favor
Chinese state companies against American investors.
 In addition, U.S. allies in Asia worry about Chinese
aggression. Japan and China have feuded over islands in the
East China Sea and China has spent heavily to modernize its
military, sent its navy further afield and asserted sovereignty
over the contested South China Sea.
 Hu's visit is unlikely to create any immediate policy
breakthroughs but could give the countries more time to ease
tensions and nurture deeper mutual confidence, said Sun Zhe, a
professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing.
 ""If this easing can last until after the end of the visit,
say into February and beyond, that will give both sides three
months to work on their ties and achieve a steadier
relationship,"" Sun said.
 IS BEIJING BACKING WASHINGTON ON IRAN?
 Washington wants China to back moves to punish Iran for its
nuclear program but Beijing has not been as forceful as the
United States would like.
 It has used its diplomatic weight to help protect Tehran,
which it considers an ally. China backed Washington's push for
a fourth round of sanctions against Iran in June, but then
fought to remove all but one Iranian bank from a list of firms
in those sanctions.
 However, the two sides have been working more closely, and
some analysts say policy toward Iran is one area on which Hu
and Obama have found the most common ground.

 By Jeff Mason and Chris Buckley
 WASHINGTON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Chinese President Hu Jintao
arrived in the United States on Tuesday for a four-day state
visit peppered by U.S. complaints about Beijing's currency
policies but sweetened by a series of business deals.
 The White House weighed in on the dispute over the level of
the yuan hours before Hu flew in, urging China to take more
steps to allow its currency to strengthen.
 ""We believe that more must be done. That is an opinion that
is held not just by this country but by many countries around
the world,"" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said.
 Hu said earlier this week he would not accept U.S.
arguments that the yuan was undervalued -- an opening volley in
a disagreement that is expected to dominate this week's trip.
 Analysts are calling the visit the most important by a
Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping helped open bilateral ties
30 years ago, given China's growing military and diplomatic
influence and its emergence as the world's second-largest
economy after the United States.
 ""The purpose of my visit is to enhance mutual trust,
promote friendship, deepen cooperation and move forward the
positive, cooperative and comprehensive China-U.S. relationship
for the 21st century,"" Hu said in an arrival statement.
 Tensions over trade will feature prominently in Wednesday's
summit between Hu and President Barack Obama. A host of other
thorny issues, from rebalancing the global economy to dealing
with North Korea, will round out the agenda.
 BUSINESS AND POLITICS
 In a show of China's purchasing power designed to dispel
perceptions that trade is a lopsided, job-killing affair for
the United States, Hu was preceded by Chinese executives who
signed more than $8 billion in deals with U.S. firms.
 The U.S. Energy Department said Alcoa Inc and China Power
Investment Corp signed an agreement to collaborate on a range
of aluminum and clean energy projects representing $7.5 billion
in potential investment within China and abroad.
 With cooperation in the clean energy field a priority for
both governments, General Electric Co agreed with China Huadian
Corp to supply about 50 gas turbines, which will generate some
$500 million in revenue over the next five years.
 A 120-member Chinese delegation in Houston signed two
cotton import agreements with six companies that China's Xinhua
news agency reported were worth $600 million.
 At least 25 more deals are expected on the Chicago leg of
Hu's trip on Friday, city officials said.
 Details of the transactions were not entirely clear and one
U.S. industry official said a final tally of deals might depend
on whether the Chinese see the summit with Obama as a success.
 ""There's always a huge political agenda surrounding the
business issues. In this case, human rights and everything
else,"" said the official.
 CURRENCY ON CENTER STAGE
 The summit has galvanized Chinese human rights groups -- as
well as the Tibetan, Taiwanese and Uighur communities and the
banned Falun Gong sect -- that are airing grievances against
Hu's government and urging Obama to speak out on human rights.
 Pressed on how forceful Obama would be with Hu, Gibbs said:
""I think the president will be firm ... in outlining the
important beliefs of this administration and this country.""
 But currency concerns took center stage in Washington.
 Senators Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, and Olympia Snowe, a
Republican, sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner promising to introduce legislation to ""address China's
unlawful practice of currency manipulation.""
 ""China's actions to subsidize its exports through currency
manipulation pose both immediate and long-term challenges to
American manufacturers and workers still recovering from the
economic recession,"" they wrote.
 Their letter came after a group of senators said on Monday
the United States had to pass legislation to punish China if it
fails to allow its currency to rise in value.
 Geithner said pressure by U.S. lawmakers helped hammer home
the point about Beijing's currency policies.
 ""I actually think it's helpful for China to understand this
is a big issue for Americans, just like it's a big issue for
all of China's trading partners,"" he told National Public
Radio.
 The Congressional Steel Caucus of lawmakers from
steel-making states urged Obama to tell Hu that ""American
patience for its unfair and illegal trade practices, and its
exploitative and anti-competitive policies, has run out.""
 ""There's increasing frustration, particularly on the
exchange rate issue, with the pace at which the Chinese have
advanced,"" Steven Dunaway, an international economics expert at
the Council on Foreign Relations, told reporters.
 China's Foreign Ministry said it hoped U.S. lawmakers would
not sour the tone of Hu's visit, repeating that Beijing was
committed to reforming its exchange rate system.
 ""A great many factors have proven that the renminbi's
(yuan's) exchange rate policy is not the main cause of the
China-U.S. trade imbalance,"" said ministry spokesman Hong Lei.
""We hope relevant U.S. lawmakers ... avoid harming the overall
interests of China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation.""
 CHINA'S RISE PROMPTS FEARS
 Investors will watch for signs that Hu and Obama can ease
tensions after a rocky 2010 but many analysts caution not to
expect too much beyond friendly words and business deals.
 Tensions over currency were a big factor in relations last
year. The yuan has risen nearly 3.5 percent against the dollar
since Beijing ended its peg to the dollar in June, much less
than demanded by critics in the United States.
 Hu, in a written interview with The Washington Post and The
Wall Street Journal, said China had taken steps toward a more
flexible exchange rate policy.
 China also says the United States should do more to
rebalance the trade relationship. Beijing's statistics show a
surplus in China's favor of $181 billion last year but, by
Washington's reckoning, the U.S. deficit with China totaled
$252 billion during the first 11 months of 2010.
 China has tried to polish its image in the United States,
running an advertisement on large billboards featuring
basketball star Yao Ming in New York's Times Square.
 Zheng Bijian, a Chinese government adviser, said he was
concerned about U.S. fears about China's rise.
 ""If these doubts and assumptions become mainstream opinion,
and even form part of national strategic judgments, then this
will not only create grave misjudgments about China's direction
of development, it will also seriously damage the United
States' own interests and shared Sino-U.S. interests,"" he
said.

 * Estimates 2-3 million tonnes of unreported stocks globally
(Adds quote, details)
 By Polly Yam
 HONG KONG, Jan 18 (Reuters) - United Company RUSAL Ltd said
on Tuesday that it has selected four banks for a yuan-denominated
bond issue in Hong Kong that it plans to launch in the first
quarter.
 ""We have agreed with four banks to arrange this pilot RMB
bond issue for RUSAL here in Hong Kong,"" Deputy Chief Executive
Oleg Mukhamedshin told reporters on the sidelines of a financial
forum in the city.
 He did not identify the four banks as some details had yet to
be finalised, but said one was Chinese, one was from Hong Kong,
one from Europe and one bank was Russian.
 Mukhamedshin said the size of the issue should not be more
than 1 billion yuan ($152 million), depending on demand.
 ""We believe the RMB (bond) market is a promising one. (It is)
growing extremely fast. We want to be in the market at the very
beginning,"" he said.
 Mukhamedshin said RUSAL had no plans to sell its 25 percent
stake in the world's top nickel producer JSC MMC Norilsk Nickel
as the Russian company considered it a long-term investment.
 RUSAL, the world's leading primary aluminium producer, filed
lawsuits last week to defend its interest in Norilsk Nickel.
 Mukhamedshin said RUSAL expected the first physical aluminium
exchange-traded fund (ETF) to be launched in the first quarter in
London, which could draw demand for 1 million tonnes of aluminium
this year.
 ""I think it will take a certain amount time to develop this
product ... our estimate is there should be demand for 1 million
tonnes this year, depending on how quickly it is launched.""
Mukhamedshin told Reuters.
 He said RUSAL was interested in becoming a supplier of the
metal to such ETFs.
 London Metal Exchange aluminium prices rose 11 percent last
year. AT 0436 GMT on Tuesday, aluminium was traded at $2,448.5
per tonne.
 Mukhamedshin said the company estimated unreported aluminium
stocks globally stood at 2-3 million tonnes, in addition to LME
aluminium stocks, which stood at 4.44 million tonnes on Monday.
 ""We don't see the stocks rising,"" he said.
 The estimate was lower than the 11 million tonnes estimated
by another major aluminium producer Norsk Hydro ASA for reported
and unreported aluminium inventories last week.

 By Ian Chua and Masayuki Kitano
 SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The euro dipped on
Tuesday as uncertainty grew over whether officials will agree to
beef up a euro zone safety fund this week, putting the currency
on shaky ground again.
 With a lot of short positions having been wiped out after
last week's rally and repeated failure at the highs near
$1.3500, markets appeared ready to put on fresh bets against the
single currency.
 The euro faced renewed selling after euro zone finance
ministers made no firm decisions on Monday regarding possible
additional measures to quell a sovereign debt crisis that has
forced Greece and Ireland to take bailouts put nations such as
Portugal and Spain under heavy pressure. [ID:nL3E7CH09B]
 ""What indications we have heard from European officials over
the past several days is that they just don't feel the same
sense of urgency that the market does,"" said Todd Elmer,
currency strategist with Citi in Singapore.
 ""I think for the time being that means the euro is likely to
trade lower,"" Elmer said, adding that the euro could dip back
towards $1.30 in coming weeks.
 Europe's safety net fund can borrow on the market with euro
zone government guarantees of up to 440 billion euros, but
analysts say a new package of anti-crisis measures is both
essential and urgent.
 The euro dipped 0.1 percent on the day to $1.3286 ,
and fell to as low as $1.3254 earlier, well off a one-month high
of $1.3458 set last Friday on trading platform EBS.
 The euro was also mostly lower on the crosses, dipping 0.3
percent against sterling to 83.41 pence  and 0.2
percent against the yen to 109.71 yen .
 The euro's recent failure to break above its mid-December
peak of $1.3500 suggests that the single currency may remain
stuck in its range seen over the past month, of $1.3500 to
$1.2860, in the near-term.
 ""Although there have been some wild ups and downs, when you
think about it, the euro has not really been able to break out
of a range roughly between $1.3 to $1.35,"" said a trader for a
major Japanese bank in Singapore.
 ""I don't think you can make any definitive assumptions,"" the
trader said, referring to the euro's near-term direction.
 Immediate support is seen in the $1.3230 area, a level
representing the 38.2 percent retracement of last week's 4
percent rally.
 EURO SUPPORT NEAR $1.32
 The euro may test its downside support near $1.3200 later on
Tuesday, pressured by Germany's hesitation to expand the euro
zone's safety fund, said Michiyoshi Kato, senior vice president
of foreign exchange sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank in Tokyo.
 The euro was facing selling on the crosses, against
currencies such as sterling, Kato said.
 ""I am bearish on the euro in the mid to long term,"" Kato
said, adding that the euro may dip to around $1.25 by the end of
March and could test $1.2 by the end of the year.
 ""Unless the euro zone economy recovers as a whole, the
single currency may stay weak,"" he added.
 Comments from European Central Bank policymaker
Athanasios Orphanides that the ECB's latest policy statement was
not ""overly hawkish"" and Spain's move to cancel this week's
proposed bond sales, opting for syndicated bond issue instead,
also gave traders reasons to turn bearish on the currency.
 Still, European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner
Olli Rehn held out hope for the effective lending capacity of
the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) rescue fund to
be expanded, saying he was confident of such an outcome.
[ID:nWEA1829]
 BNP Paribas analysts said this means dips in euro/dollar
should provide an opportunity to enter a near-term tactical long
position in the $1.3220 area, from where they expect a rebound
through last week's high towards $1.36.
 ""However, we emphasise that we remain bearish EURUSD over
the medium term and we would look to use rebounds to establish
structural bearish position once it becomes clear that any
changes to the EFSF are falling short of market expectations.""
 The dollar dipped 0.1 percent to 82.57 yen .

 * Tech shares up despite news Apple CEO taking leave
 * Nikkei up slightly, Shainghai inches down

 By Yoko Nishikawa	
 SINGAPORE, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The euro rose slightly against
the dollar on Tuesday but lingering concerns over the euro
zone's debt crisis limited its gains, while Asian tech shares
rallied on hopes for a recovery in battered memory chip prices. 
 News that Apple Inc CEO Steve Jobs is taking
medical leave for the third time since 2004 also prompted the
view that its Asian rivals may slow the runaway success of the
iPhone and iPad maker. But investors wanted to see Wall Street's
reaction later in the day.	
 Hopes for improvement in the euro zone debt crisis after
relatively smooth bond auctions in Portugal and Spain were being
tested by Germany, which saw no urgency to beef up the currency
bloc's bailout fund. 
 ""What indications we have heard from European officials over
the past several days is that they just don't feel the same
sense of urgency that the market does,"" said Todd Elmer,
currency strategist with Citi in Singapore.	
 ""I think for the time being that means the euro is likely to
trade lower,"" Elmer said, adding that the euro could dip back
towards $1.30 in coming weeks.	
 Speaking after a monthly meeting of the euro zone finance
ministers on Monday, the group's chairman, Jean-Claude Juncker,
was careful not to commit to being ready for a new package of
measure to end the debt crisis in time for the Feb. 4 or March
24-25 European Union leaders' summits. 
 The euro inched higher to $1.3312 as of 0601 GMT,
after having slid to a low of around $1.3243 overnight, well off
a one-month high near $1.3460 set last Friday. 
 Europe set up the safety net fund, which can borrow on the
markets with euro zone government guarantees of up to 440
billion euros, in response the debt crisis that forced Greece
and Ireland to take bailouts last year.	
 As worries over the euro zone's debt crisis linger, Greece's
deputy prime minister said on Monday extending the repayment of
the nation's debt could help the overborrowed country emerge
from its debt crisis. {ID:nLDE70G2BL]	
 Some traders said signs of stability in China's stock market
, after a 3 percent slide on Monday, may also have helped
underpin the euro.	
 
 APPLE'S IMPACT EYED	
 Stock market players awaited Wall Street's reaction to
Apple's announcement, which knocked U.S. stock futures sharply
lower on Monday when U.S. markets were closed for a public
holiday. 
 Apple's market capitalisation is about as big as Japan's 11
biggest tech firms combined. The impact of its news could be
mixed for Asian technology rivals.	
 Some could benefit if Apple's success slows, boosting the
popularity of their own products, but others in the supply chain
rely on its orders for displays, chips, phone cases and other
accessories associated with its popular gadgets. 
Japan's Nikkei average closed up 0.15 percent, while
the MSCI index of Asia and Pacific shares excluding Japan
rose 0.5 percent.	
 Tech shares outperformed, however, with the MSCI Asian IT
index outside of Japan up 1.3 percent.	
 Shares of Samsung Electronics Co , a rival to
Apple in some business areas and the world's top memory
chipmaker, jumped as much as 3.3 percent to record highs after a
newspaper report that Japan's Elpida planned to raise chip
prices by about 10 percent. 
 Elpida ended 1.1 percent higher on the report.	
 The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.2 percent after
slumping a day earlier in reaction to China's decision on Friday
to raise lenders' reserve requirements. The decline weighed on
bourses across Asia which have drawn considerable support from
China's robust economic growth.	
 But Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index managed to avoid the
downdraft and rose 0.6 percent on hopes for stronger corporate
earnings.	
 U.S. crude futures were little changed above $91 a barrel on
Tuesday after falling the previous day when the dollar
strengthened and a major Alaskan oil pipeline resumed full
operations.

 * Chicago, Boston among other U.S. cities on agenda
 By Chris Baltimore
 HOUSTON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The Chinese government kicked
off a four-day U.S. trade mission on Monday by signing six
deals in Houston with undisclosed U.S. companies worth $600
million, according to Chinese state media reports.
 The deals came a day before Chinese President Hu Jintao
arrives in the United States for a visit being billed as the
most important U.S.-China summit since Deng Xiaoping's visit to
Washington 30 years ago.
 China's vice commerce minister, Wang Chao, led a business
delegation to Houston, signing two cotton import agreements, an
agreement on import of assembly kits, an agreement on
""development and application of efficient crystalline silicon
solar cells and photovoltaic generation system,"" and a deal on
porcelain imports, said state media outlet Xinhua.
 An official with the Chinese Consulate in Houston declined
to provide details on the companies involved.
 Wang's Houston delegation included 120 government and
business officials, said the Greater Houston Partnership, the
city's business development arm.
 It included chief executives from some of China's largest
firms in the areas of trade, health, biotechnology, real
estate, manufacturing, banking and education, the Partnership
said.
 Chinese officials and company representatives will hold
similar events in Washington, Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis,
Raleigh, North Carolina, and Frankfort, Kentucky, this week.
 Business deals worth potentially tens of billions of
dollars could be announced, but U.S. industry officials have
been hesitant to estimate a dollar amount.
 In Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama and Hu are
expected to discuss a wide range of issues, including stability
on the Korean peninsula and simmering tensions over a
ballooning trade gap.
 The U.S. trade deficit with China is expected to hit $270
billion this year. The two countries blame each other for
causing problems in international commerce.

 * Strike revives farm dispute that shook nation in 2008
 * Trade expects muted impact due to pre-harvest timing
(Updates with grains market paralyzed, fresh Buzzi quote)
 By Helen Popper
 BUENOS AIRES, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Argentine farmers halted sales of wheat,
corn and soy on Monday as they went on strike over export curbs, rekindling a
dispute that helped drive global grains prices to record highs three years ago.
 The seven-day protest by growers in the South American nation, one of the
world's biggest food providers, could fuel supply concerns just as dry weather
linked to the La Nina weather pattern worsens the outlook for soy and corn
output.
 Highways near the main grains hub of Rosario were unusually free of trucks
on Monday morning after a busy weekend of hauling grains to crushing plants
ahead of the strike, which was not expected to disrupt exports.
 Argentine farmers have been at odds with the government for years over
export curbs aimed at taming double-digit inflation and guaranteeing affordable
supplies of everyday staples.
 They say a system of wheat and corn export quotas lets millers and exporters
pay farmers low prices, demanding that center-left President Cristina Fernandez
scrap the caps so they can enjoy high wheat prices as they harvest a bumper
crop.
 ""We must improve and normalize grains trade in Argentina, especially for
wheat and corn. Farmers lose fortunes and consumers have to pay more for their
daily bread,"" said Eduardo Buzzi, head of the Argentine Agrarian Federation, one
of the four farm groups leading the strike.
 Buzzi said government policies only serve to benefit multinational
commodities exporters such as Cargill [CARG.UL] and Louis Dreyfus.
 He added later that some farm leaders are already mulling further protests,
though not necessarily another commercial strike, if the government does not
reform its wheat policy.
 ""Continuing the protests over the coming weeks, until we get a definitive
solution, has been discussed,"" Buzzi said in a statement.

 Stories on Argentine crop weather [ID:nN29275354]
 
 This week's strike, which will last until midnight on Sunday, is bad news
for Fernandez, just nine months before her widely expected bid for re-election.
 The wave of farmer strikes that began in March 2008 over a tax increase on
soy exports battered her popularity, hit Argentine asset prices and disrupted
grains shipments at the height of the soy harvest.
 The latest protest is not expected to rouse the same public interest or
support as in 2008, and the impact on grain prices will likely be muted because
harvesting has not yet begun.
 Buzzi said farmers would not set up roadblocks as they did sporadically in
2008, sparking shortages of food and fuel, adding that the strike was largely
symbolic.
 WEATHER JITTERS
 In Rosario-area ports, trade is generally light at this time of year and soy
crushers and exporters increased purchases last week to build up stocks in
anticipation of the strike.
 The Rosario grains market will be open this week but traders said they would
stay away to show support for farmers and trade was almost nonexistent on
Monday.
 Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade will likely be more concerned about
the impact of parched conditions on Argentina's soy and corn crops than on the
farmers' strike, although rains over the weekend brought relief to some areas.
<0#S:>
 Crop analysts have started to slash production forecasts for the grains --
to as little as 40 million tonnes in the case of soy from initial estimates for
about 52 million tonnes.
 Weather jitters have helped lift corn and soy prices in recent weeks close
to their record highs of 2008. Soaring prices are good news for farmers, but the
dry soils are worsening the mood across Argentina's famous Pampas plains.
 Government officials condemned the farmers for calling another strike, even
warning of possible flour shortages, although Agriculture Minister Julian
Dominguez acknowledged wheat farmers' problems.
 He advocated an even stronger state role in the country's
multibillion-dollar grains trade, calling for the creation of a national grains
board involving the state, grains exchanges and farming cooperatives.

 * Putin to meet Belarus PM later this week
 * European diesel cargo diffs at more than two-year highs
 
 (Adds detail, background)
 By Emma Farge
 LONDON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Belarus has suspended diesel
exports to Europe, traders told Reuters on Monday in a first
sign that its dispute with Russia over crude oil pricing is
beginning to have an impact on global energy markets.
 Traders said a halt in Belarusian exports pushed European
diesel cargo differentials to more than two-year highs and that
Europe typically receives around 200,000 tonnes of diesel from
Belarus a month.
 ""I don't see any exports. They export mainly diesel, so that
has added to the market tightness,"" said a London-based oil
products trader.
 Russia suspended crude oil flows to Belarus on Jan. 1 amid a
pricing dispute, although it continued exports to Germany and
Poland via Belarus along the Druzhba pipeline.
 Both sides have so far described the problems as technical
and have pledged not to repeat the crises of previous years,
when similar disputes cut Russia's entire crude exports along
Druzhba, amounting to 1 million bpd or around one third of
combined Polish and German consumption.
 Moscow's relations with Minsk have become particularly
strained in recent years after Belarusian President Alexander
Lukashenko, criticised by the West for authoritarian rule, has
declined to sell to Moscow some of Belarus's most lucrative
firms in exchange for cheap energy supplies.
 Moscow says it is not trying to use energy as a tool of
intimidation of blackmail and is simply withdrawing its
subsidies to neighbours after years of cheap energy supplies.
 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin will meet his Belarusian
counterpart Mikhail Myasnikovich on Thursday, the Russian news
agencies reported, which indicated oil supplies would probably
remain suspended at least until this meeting.
 
 UKRAINE-BELARUS DEAL
 Also on Monday, Ukraine and Belarus signed a two-year deal
on oil transit through Ukraine's Odessa-Brody pipeline in a move
likely to further upset Russia, because it would allow Belarus
to import alternative crude supplies.
 Under the Monday deal, Ukraine will tranship 4 million
tonnes of light crude a year to the Mozyr refinery in Belarus,
it said in a statement. The ministry did not say where the oil
would come from. 
 Belarus has purchased several cargoes of Venezuelan crude
through the route, which traders said made no economic sense but
was meant to show that Minsk can find alternative sources of
crude.
 Belarus has also said it may try to buy Azeri crude through
the same route.
 Diesel cargo differentials in northwest Europe were at
premiums of $48 a tonne to the benchmark gasoil future on the
IntercontinentalExchange and the highest since September 2008,
according to Reuters data.
 Traders said that strong winter demand for diesel - now used
widely as a heating fuel in Europe - also helped boost prices.

(Adds quotes)
 BORDEAUX, France, Jan 17 (Reuters) - ECB Governing Council
member Christian Noyer said on Monday that states should provide
crisis aid to their financial systems only in exceptional cases
because of the risks to competition.
 ""This type of support is not something to resort to lightly.
They are ways of working that impede competition in an economy,
so it needs to be kept for use in exceptional circumstances,"" he

capacity of the euro zone rescue fund after Greece and Ireland

 On top of competition issues and the cost to the public of
aid to the financial sector, such moves had become politically
unpalatable, Noyer said.
""The state of mind of public opinion is that it would be
very difficult to help the banks. It's not an easy sell
politically speaking.
 ""Therefore, we need to put in place mechanisms that make

 * Shares in joint ventures with foreign firms to be sold

(adds PM on corruption, central banker on gold reserves)
 By Paul Taylor
 PARIS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Tunisia's economy will be purged
legally of the grip of overthrown president Zine el-Abedine Ben
Ali's extended family, and is well placed to flourish, a leading
Tunisian economist said on Monday.
 Moncef Cheikhrouhou, forced to sell his shares in a family
press group to a relative of the president and go into exile in
2000, said a commission created by the Justice Ministry would
unravel assets acquired through nepotism and corruption.
 ""They behaved like a mafia that reaped money from all
sectors of the Tunisian economy,"" Cheikhrouhou told Reuters in
an interview in Paris, where he teaches international finance at
the HEC business school.
 ""For example, all car imports had to be controlled by the
family. Tunisians who wanted to import new brands either had to
give a majority stake to a member of the family without paying,
or hand over a rake-off on the profits,"" he said.
 Cheikhrouhou said Tunisia had a young entrepreneurial class
eager to create wealth and jobs once the suffocating hand of the
ruling clan was removed from the economy, and a competent civil
service capable of administering the country.
 The World Bank estimated Tunisia's growth rate could be
raised two or three percentage points from 4 percent a year to
India's level if corruption and nepotism were removed, he said.
 Cheikhrouhou, 65, vice-president of the Circle of Arab
Economists, is close to reformist opposition figures forming a
coalition government and is seen as a possible finance or
economy minister in a democratic administration.
 ""Tunisia isn't starting from zero,"" he said, noting that
some 1,350 French companies and 300-400 Italian firms, as well
as some big U.S. enterprises, had set up a presence in the North
African state of 10 million people, which has a free-trade
agreement for goods with the European Union.
 
 FLAGRANT
 Many foreign firms that did business in Tunisia were forced
to enter into partnership with relatives of Ben Ali and his wife
Leila's Trabelsi family, which would now have to be unwound.
 ""We are trying to make sure that the rule of law prevails in
Tunisia,"" he said. ""I expect this commission will receive an
enormous number of demands for compensation. The most flagrant
cases, the Trabelsi and Chiboub families, will be treated more
simply like money laundering cases.""
 The Chiboub family are related to Ben Ali by marriage to one
of his daughters.
 Several members of the Trabelsi family have been arrested or
attacked since Ben Ali and his wife fled abroad last Friday.
 Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi said on Monday that the
government will investigate anyone suspected of corruption or of
having amassed huge wealth under the deposed leader.
 A senior central bank official, Habib Maalej, denied reports
that the ex-president's family had taken 1.5 tonnes of gold
worth $66 million out of the country.
 ""I was very surprised to read this information and I affirm
and confirm that the gold reserves in Tunisia are very well
preserved and not one ounce was brought out,"" Maalej said in a
telephone interview with the African Manager website.
 Illustrating how foreign investment worked under Ben Ali,
Cheikhrouhou cited the example of French do-it-yourself chain
Bricorama, which had moved into Tunisia by making a partnership
with a member of the Trabelsi family.
 ""Legally, we will have to find Bricorama another partner.
The shares will be sold to bidders in an open process,"" he said.
 Protesters attacked or looted several French-owned
businesses, including Carrefour and Monoprix supermarkets,
during the Tunisian unrest.
 Cheikhrouhou said the attacks were due to anger at French
President Nicolas Sarkozy's longstanding support for Ben Ali,
whom Paris refused to criticise until the day before he fled,
but would not last now the dictatorship had been overthrown.

 Citibank, HSBC and Societe Generale will lead manage the

 The benchmark issue is part of the financial assistance
programme for Ireland, the EFSF said in a statement.
 ""Over 2011 and 2012 EFSF will raise up to 26.5 billion euros

Fitch, Moody's and Standard & Poor's.

said in the statement.
 ""I am confident that the strong position of these highly
regarded global institutions in the market will ensure the
success of our first issue, helping to restore stability

 Based in Luxembourg, the EFSF was introduced last year by
the European Union to provide a financial safety net for euro
zone countries in economic strife.
 Euro zone finance ministers will discuss an increase to the
fund's effective lending capacity on Monday, though France said
it would be March before a firm plan was in place.
 A Reuters poll of analysts published on Monday said the EFSF
would need to be increased from its current 440 billion euros
($586 billion) in order to meet potential claims upon it, with
the median figure suggesting a boost to 700 billion.
 Markets expect Portugal and possibly Spain to eventually
need an European Union-led bailout similar to those handed out
to Ireland and Greece last year.

month
 * Purchase comes amid unrest linked to rising food prices
 * Other North African countries also securing wheat supplies
 
 (Adds quotes, background)
 By Valerie Parent
 PARIS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Algeria bought 600,000 tonnes of
wheat, traders said on Monday, snapping up grain at a time of
high prices and tight supply even as neighbouring countries take
measures to head off Tunisia-style unrest over food inflation.
 Algeria, Libya and Jordan have this month either relaxed
food taxes or duties on food imports or cut prices of staple
foods, keen to damp down the sort of unrest over food prices
which has toppled Tunisian President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.
 Traders said the latest Algerian buy, which brings its wheat
purchases this month to around 1 million tonnes, have been
driven by tight supplies after weather problems hit the 2010
harvest in the Black Sea and Europe, sending prices higher.
 Alex Bos, commodity strategist at Macquarie Bank said some
countries were looking back to 2007/2008 when soaring food
prices sparked riots in countries such as Egypt, Cameroon and
Haiti and looking to safeguard grain balances.
 ""I think a lot of these major wheat importing countries do
want to step in and try and provide a buffer supply internally
on the chance that wheat fundamentals become as tight as they
were in 2007/08,"" said Bos
 ""There is certainly a growing nervousness in some of these
countries about attaining sufficient wheat supplies for the year
ahead,"" Bos added.
 The latest Algerian purchase, which traders said was done
last week at prices ranging between $360 and $365 a tonne
including cost and freight, follows a buy on Jan.6 of 350,000
tonnes at of wheat at around $353 a tonne.
 Some traders put the volume of purchase above 600,000
tonnes, with one citing 750,000 tonnes. 
 This was just the latest of a series of deals from buyers in
the region with traders reporting separately that Libya had
purchased about 100,000 tonnes of milling wheat in a tender that
closed on Jan. 10.
 Last week, Turkey bought 300,000 tonnes of wheat and Lebanon
25,000 tonnes, while Jordan last week tendered for 100,000
tonnes of wheat just as hundreds protested against high prices
in the south of the country.
 ""All governments have seen what is happening in Tunisia and
be it Algeria or other countries in the region, they will all
try to calm food inflation at any price, and this will put
pressure on wheat markets,"" said analyst Michel Portier from
French grain analyst Agritel.
 
 DEEP DEMAND
 Global wheat prices have been supported after drought hit
harvests in Russia and Ukraine while rains damaged crop quality
in parts of Europe last year, helping Euronext wheat futures to
almost double in 2010.
 On Monday, with U.S. grain markets closed for the Martin
Luther King Jr public holiday, Euronext March wheat traded up
0.4 percent at 252.00 euros ($335.5) a tonne.
 ""Obviously the Black Sea is out, the European Union is
quickly running out of available supplies to export so I think
that is going to be a concern for consumers,"" Rabobank analyst
Luke Chandler said.
 ""I think consumers are watching the situation globally and
are very concerned about the lack of forward physical sales they
have on their books over the coming months"" he added.
 One trader in Germany said the Algerian buy was larger than
he would have expected given prevailing market conditions.
 ""Importers would not want to buy at the time of current high
prices unless they needed to but some can afford to buy their
way out of problems,"" the trader said, referring to the
purchasing power wielded by oil rich Libya and Algeria.
 Official media reported earlier this month that Algerian
state grains agency OAIC would raise by 18 percent the amount of
soft wheat it supplies each month to the local market.
 ""They are clearly trying to build up reserves,"" another
trader said.
 Algerian authorities have also announced cuts to import
duties and taxes on sugar and cooking oil in response to
protests in which two people have been killed and scores
injured.
 At least four Algerians have set themselves on fire in the
past five days, several newspapers reported on Monday, echoing
the suicide that triggered the unrest that brought down the
leader of neighbouring Tunisia.

 * 15 of 68 see hike before October
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is not
seen shifting interest rates until the fourth quarter but
expectations for an earlier hike are on the up, a Reuters poll
of analysts found.
The poll, taken after the ECB left rates on hold at a record
low of 1.0 percent on Jan 13, gave a median prediction that
rates would first rise in the final three months of 2011 to 1.25
percent, in line with a poll taken ahead of last week's meeting.
But after a shift in some of the bank's rhetoric after its
January meeting, 15 of 68 economists predict a rise will come
before October compared to 12 of 71 in the previous poll.
 The ECB said on Thursday the 17-nation bloc faces short-term
price pressures which must be closely-watched, wording taken by
markets as a hint it could raise interest rates to contain
inflation even while the bloc is gripped by a debt crisis.
[ID:nLDE70C26B]
 Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet also made a point of
reminding reporters that in 2008 the ECB raised rates due to oil
price-fuelled inflation just ahead of the Lehman bankruptcy that
tipped the global financial system into full-blown crisis.
 ""ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet sounded a little more
concerned about the inflation outlook last week, noting that
risks were still balanced, but could move to the upside,"" said
Nick Kounis at ABN AMRO.
 ""This is a wake-up call to markets that previously did not
expect any rate hikes this year.""
 It was, however, still a close call as to whether the bank
would tighten policy rates for the first time before the end of
2011 -- 33 of 67 saw rates still on hold until next year,
compared to 35 of 71 in the last poll.
 ""The ECB's pain threshold is being crossed and the hawkish
rhetoric reflects the fact that the ECB is currently looking at
an inflation forecast for this year that is above 2.0 percent,""
said Nick Matthews at RBS.
 With inflation taking off, most notably in fast-growing
emerging economies, several countries are already raising rates.
South Korea and Thailand were the latest Asian economies last
week to tighten as policymakers battle the impact of surging
prices of food and other commodities.
 Euro candidates Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are
all embarking or close to embarking on tightening cycles and
investors have brought forward expectations for a first rise in
UK rates to as early as May.
Median forecasts saw ECB rates ending the first quarter of
2012 at 1.25 percent, rising again to 1.5 percent by the end of
June, 1.75 percent by October and then to 2.0 percent by the end
of next year. The last poll also saw rates at 1.5 percent by
next June.

 * Senators say China currency practices threaten US jobs
 * Chinese companies swarm U.S. along with president
(Adds more quotes, background)
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - A group of U.S. senators, on
the eve of Chinese President Hu Jintao's arrival in the United
States, said it was vital Congress pass legislation to get
tough with China over its currency practices.
 ""There's no bigger step we can take to preserve the
American dream and promote job creation, particularly in the
manufacturing sector ... than to confront China's manipulation
of its currency,"" Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said.
 The message to Hu is ""we are fed up with your government's
intransigence on currency manipulation. If you refuse to play
by the same rules, we will force you to do so,"" Schumer said in
a conference call on a proposed bill to prod China to raise the
value of its yuan currency.
 Beijing's undervalued currency gives Chinese companies an
unfair price advantage in trade and have acted like ""a boot on
the throat"" of U.S. economic recovery, he said.
 The heated rhetoric shows how negatively many U.S.
lawmakers view China as Hu arrives in Washington on Tuesday for
a state visit with President Barack Obama.
 In one effort by Beijing to generate goodwill for the trip,
representatives of hundreds of Chinese companies will be in the
United States this week in conjunction with Hu's visit.
 Events are planned in about a half dozen cities including
Houston, Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, Raleigh, North Carolina
and Frankfort, Kentucky.
 Business deals worth potentially tens of billions of
dollars could be announced but U.S. industry officials have
been hesitant to estimate a dollar amount.
 Schumer, who was joined on the call by Senators Debbie
Stabenow and Robert Casey, said there was broad bipartisan
support in both the Senate and the House of Representatives to
pass currency legislation.
 However, lawmakers in both chambers have complained for
years that China undervalues its currency by as much as 40
percent but have not fully approved legislation that would do
something about it.
 That was true last year, when the House passed a China
currency bill but the Senate failed to act.
 In a rare written interview published on Sunday by the Wall
Street Journal and the Washington Post, Hu said China had taken
steps toward a more flexible exchange rate policy.
 But he appeared to reject a U.S. argument that Beijing let
its currency appreciate faster to help rein in domestic
inflationary pressure.
 China is the world's biggest foreign holder of U.S.
government debt, with a third of its $2.85 trillion in foreign
exchange reserves invested in U.S. Treasuries.
 The senators' bipartisan bill would require the Treasury
Department to investigate ""China's manipulation of its currency
and actually do something about it,"" Schumer said.
 By also allowing companies to request the Commerce
Department impose duties to offset Beijing's exchange rate
practices, the bill tells China ""we want you to have a level
playing field on trade. If you don't we're going to create it
ourselves,"" Stabenow said.
 But John Frisbie, president of the U.S.-China Business
Council, warned passing currency legislation would likely
backfire on the United States by inflaming relations and
opening the door to retaliation.
 ""It's counterproductive. It wouldn't help get to the goal
of a market-oriented exchange rate,"" he said.
 Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, in a letter
to Hu, also urged China to showed ""a renewed commitment"" to
move to a more market-oriented exchange rate and to follow
through on recent commitments to fight copyright piracy by
taking concrete steps to boost use of legal software.
 On another issue important to the Montana Democrat, Baucus
said he was disappointed that talks aimed at reopening China's
market to U.S. beef have not been resolved.
 ""I urge these negotiations to successfully conclude as
quickly as possible. International scientific standards
(regarding the safety of U.S. beef) are clear, and there simply
is no excuse for China's refusal to abide by them,"" he said.

(Recasts with port activity, estimates)
 By Charlie Dunmore and Ange Aboa
 BRUSSELS/ABIDJAN, Jan 17 (Reuters) - EU-registered vessels
are barred from new financial dealings with Ivory Coast's two
main cocoa-exporting ports, EU sources said on Monday, as part
of sanctions imposed after November's contested election.
 On Saturday, the EU froze the European assets of the two
main ports in Ivory Coast -- the world's biggest cocoa exporter
-- saying they were ""helping to fund the illegitimate government
of Mr Laurent Gbagbo"".
 But the head of Abidjan port dismissed the measures as
""idiotic"" steps whose only victims would be European firms.
 Officials said the sanctions barred EU-registered vessels
and companies from entering into any financial transactions with
the ports, unless covered by a previously agreed contract.
 ""So that would essentially result in a prohibition to make
business with those entities,"" a European Commission official
who helped draft the sanctions told Reuters by phone.
 The sanctions are designed to increase pressure on incumbent
leader Laurent Gbagbo to step down after a Nov. 28 election he
is widely believed to have lost.
 French government spokesman Gael Veyssiere said his
country's interpretation of the sanctions was that EU companies
or operators were barred from financial dealings with the Ivory
Coast ports of Abidjan and San Pedro.
 ""I don't know if operators are obliged to have a direct
dealings with the port itself, or if they deal with
sub-contractors or other third parties,"" he said.
 ""But in any case, no EU company can write a cheque to any of
the entities on the sanctions list.""
 
 PORT MAINTAINS 2011 TARGET
 Separately, cocoa arrivals to main ports were estimated to
be above last year's levels despite the crisis, underlining the
resilience of the cocoa trade to the instability that has dogged
the world's top grower since a 2002-2003 civil war.
 In the market, dealers noted uncertainty about the impact of
the sanctions.
 ""The ports of Abidjan and San Pedro are major exit points
for cocoa exports. So (EU sanctions) are going to make everyone
feel more uncertain,"" VM Group analyst Gary Mead said. 
 Reuters reporters said activity at the port on Monday
resembled that on a normal day, with two large vessels bound for
Amsterdam port being loaded up with crates of cocoa beans.
 May cocoa on Liffe ended 8 pounds lower at 1,999 pounds a
tonne on Monday.
 Abidjan port managing director Marcel Gossio said he
interpreted the EU sanctions as merely freezes on funds and
assets held by it and 10 other entities within Europe, and that
the only victims would be European firms whose payments for work
carried out at the port would now be jeopardised.
 ""I think these are idiotic decisions. It means they will
freeze the accounts of Abidjan port in their countries. But the
accounts are there to pay European contractors. So I won't pay
them and that will be it,"" he said.
 Gossio reaffirmed the port's target to move 26 million
tonnes of merchandise this year, up from 24-25 million in 2010.
 Exporters estimated on Monday that cocoa arrivals to Abidjan
and San Pedro port were running more than 2.4 percent ahead of
last year despite the effects of a political crisis.
 ""The figures speak for themselves,"" said the director of an
export company in Abidjan. ""This is the first time we've had
60,000 tonnes in a week, and it shows the harvest is good.""

 By Neal Armstrong
LONDON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on Monday
as hopes for an immediate increase in the euro zone's bailout
fund faded and investors reassessed a recent rise in European
Central Bank interest rate expectations.
 Uncertainty about whether Germany would support an increase
in the effective lending capacity of the safety fund, known as
the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), put pressure
on the euro ahead of a meeting of euro zone finance ministers.
The subject is expected to dominate the talks.
 The euro traded at $1.3290, down 0.65 percent on the day
after falling to as low as $1.3243 on trading platform EBS.
 It was off a one-month high of $1.3458 hit on Friday when
some speculators went long on the euro following solid debt
auctions by Spain and Portugal and hawkish comments on inflation
from European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet. 
 Hopes that euro zone policymakers may expand the rescue fund
swiftly had fed into that too, but German Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Monday that there was no urgent need
for a decision.. 
 Senior European sources told Reuters the sense of urgency in
Berlin for boosting the fund had diminished after the successful
bond auctions in Spain and Portugal, the two countries seen most
at risk of needing any further bailouts.
 Instead Germany is pushing for broader anti-crisis measures
to be agreed at a summit of European Union leaders in March.
 ""It's becoming increasingly apparent that Germany doesn't
want an increase in the rescue fund and that's weighing on euro
sentiment today because there were positive expectations
building last week,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at
UBS in Zurich.
 ""We believe the euro is a sell on rallies because investors
are not minded to buy euro-denominated assets while structural
problems in the euro zone persist,"" he added.
 Spain on Monday cancelled a proposed bond auction slated for
later in the week, opting for a syndicated bond issue instead,
unnerving investors and providing another reason to sell the
euro as peripheral bond spreads widened over German benchmarks.

 Latest data showed the ECB spent 2.3 billion euros buying
government bonds, its highest amount in over a month as it
sought debt markets in struggling issuers.
 
 RATE EXPECTATIONS
 ECB policymaker Athanasios Orphanides added to the pressure
on the euro by playing down the bank's language from last week,
when markets took the bank's warnings on inflation and Trichet's
on previous rate rises as a sign it could move sooner than
previously thought. 
 Orphanides said the ECB's statement on Thursday had not been
""overly hawkish"" and that there was sometimes an overreaction to
the bank's underlying message.
 Analysts said that with inflation looking to pick up in
coming months, rate hike expectations would not go away.
 ""The markets will not short a position knowing inflation is
on the way up,"" said Chris Turner, head of FX strategy at ING.
 The three-month Euribor rate -- traditionally the main gauge
of unsecured interbank euro lending and a mix of interest rate
expectations and banks' appetite for lending -- rose to 1.009
percent on Monday from 1.006 percent.
 The dollar was up against a currency basket at 79.32. But
trading conditions were thin due to a U.S. public holiday.
It saw little reaction to comments from top Federal Reserve
official Charles Plosser who did not rule out a 2011 rate rise.
 The dollar was down on the yen, easing to 82.60 yen, and
within its well-worn range of the past few weeks. The yen was
also stronger against the euro with the single currency shedding
nearly 1 percent against the Japanese unit. The euro was down
0.94 percent at 109.91 yen.
 Sterling advanced to a eight-week high against the dollar,
bolstered by rising speculation the Bank of England could raise
interest rates as early as June. The pound rose as high as
$1.5955, its strongest since late November, moving past option
barriers at $1.5900.

 By Carolyn Cohn
 LONDON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Emerging stocks fell on Monday
after policy tightening by China drove down Chinese markets, but
Russian stocks hit a four-month high following a deal between
Rosneft and BP.
Chinese shares <.SSEC> fell more than 3 percent to
three-month lows after the central bank announced a 50-basis
point rise in lenders' reserve requirements -- after Shanghai
markets closed on Friday.
 The cost of insuring Tunisian and other North African
sovereigns' debt against default also soared as investors
worried about political stability in the region.
Worries about the euro zone debt crisis kept a broad cap on
any optimism amongst investors, keeping emerging European
markets under pressure ahead of a meeting of euro zone finance
ministers later on Monday.
""Equities are down a bit because of the Chinese reserve
requirements, that's set the mood,"" said Nigel Rendell, emerging
markets strategist at RBC.
 ""The euro zone worry in the background is cited as one of
the reasons for a little caution.""
The MSCI emerging equities index <.MSCIEF> dropped 0.4
percent to its lowest in five days. Turkish stocks <.XU100> fell
more than 1 percent to a two-week low.
Russian stocks <.IRTS> rose 1.6 percent, however, with
Rosneft <.ROSN.MM> up 4 percent after BP  agreed on Friday
to form a joint venture with the Russian firm to develop three
of Rosneft's offshore exploration blocks in northern Russia.

 Emerging sovereign debt spreads tightened by 3 basis points
to 235 bps over U.S. Treasuries <11EMJ>.
 Nigeria plans to issue a debut $500 million Eurobond on
Friday following a roadshow this week, the head of the country's
Debt Management Office said, while Russia's state bank VEB is
planning a 300 million Swiss franc bond.
 
 RATE RISES
 Serbia's dinar rose more than 1 percent against the euro
 after the country's central bank raised interest rates
by 50 basis points to 12 percent, its sixth rate rise since
August 2010. 
 Other emerging European currencies, which have also been
boosted by expectations of monetary tightening, were generally
flat to slightly stronger.
 The rand  rallied from the day's lows after ratings
agency Fitch revised its outlook on South Africa to stable from
negative, citing a better than expected recovery from the global
financial crisis.
 Tunisia's five-year credit default swaps rose 25 bps to 190

LONDON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on Monday
as hopes for an immediate increase in the euro zone's bailout
fund faded and as investors reassessed a recent rise in European
Central Bank interest rate expectations.
 Uncertainty about whether Germany would support an increase
in the effective lending capacity of the bailout fund, known as
the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), put pressure
on the euro as attention was focused on a meeting of euro zone
finance ministers. The subject is expected to dominate the
meeting. [ID:nLDE70F09T]
 The euro traded at $1.3335 , down 0.3 percent on the
day after falling to as low as $1.3243 on trading platform EBS.
Traders said decent buying by Irish banks helped the euro
recover from those lows.
 Still, it was off a one-month high of $1.3458 hit on Friday
when speculators went long after solid debt auctions by Spain
and Portugal and hawkish comments on inflation from European
Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet and hopes that euro

 ""It's becoming increasingly apparent that Germany doesn't
want an increase in the rescue fund and that's weighing on euro

 Spain cancelled on Monday a proposed bond auction slated for

which rattled investor confidence and gave another reason to
sell the euro as peripheral bond spreads widened over German
benchmarks. [ID:nLDE70G0PQ]
 
 RATE EXPECTATIONS
 ECB policymaker Athanasios Orphanides added pressure on the
euro by playing down euro zone rate hike expectations, which
rose last week after the ECB hinted it was ready to act to curb
inflation if necessary.
 Orphanides said the ECB statement on Thursday had not been
""overly hawkish"" and that there was sometimes an overreaction to
the bank's underlying message. [ID:nLDE70G0VB]
 Analysts, however, said that with inflation looking to pick
up in coming months, rate hike expectations would not go away in
a hurry.
 ""The markets will not short a position knowing inflation is
on the way up,"" said Chris Turner, head of FX strategy at ING.
 The three-month Euribor rate -- traditionally the main gauge
of unsecured interbank euro lending and a mix of interest rate
expectations and banks' appetite for lending -- rose to 1.009
percent on Monday from 1.006 percent.
 The dollar was flat against a currency basket <.DXY> at

reduce liquidity into the European afternoon.
 The dollar was down on the yen, easing to 82.39 yen ,
but within its well-worn range of the past few weeks. The yen
was also stronger against the euro with the single currency
shedding nearly 1 percent against the Japanese unit. The euro
was down 0.94 percent at 109.91 yen .
 Sterling advanced to a eight-week high against the dollar,
bolstered by rising speculation that UK inflation pressures
could prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates as
early as June. The pound rose to as high as $1.5917 ,
its strongest since late November, and moving past option
barriers at $1.5900.

 * Pound at weakest in almost six years

 * Risk premium on Egyptian debt sharply higher
 
 (Wraps pound and stock declines, adds comment, background)
 CAIRO, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Egyptian stocks posted their
biggest drop in seven months and the pound dipped to its weakest
against the dollar in almost six years on Monday as investors
grew concerned that political turmoil in Tunisia could spread to
Egypt.
 Traders had been awaiting the reaction of foreign investors
to events in Tunisia when European markets opened on Monday.
Egypt's weekend is Friday and Saturday and its currency market
and stock exchange had been relatively subdued on Sunday.
 An Egyptian man set himself alight near parliament on Monday
morning in an apparent protest against poor living standards, a
witness and officials said, echoing a self-immolation that
spurred the wave of demonstrations in Tunisia.
 ""It's Tunisia, and then the man setting himself on fire in
Cairo this morning,"" said a trader at a bank in the capital
city. ""There's some hot money flying out of the market, mainly
foreigners selling.""
 Activists throughout the Arab world say they have been
inspired by the example of events in Tunisia, which marked the
first time in generations that an Arab leader was toppled by
public protests.
 Egypt's government is adamant there will be no large-scale
unrest on its watch.
 But the cost of insuring Egyptian sovereign debt against
default rose sharply, with five-year credit default swaps rising
40 basis points to 320 basis points, an 18 month high, according
to Markit.
 The pound traded as low as 5.8263 to the dollar on Monday,
its lowest since early February 2005 and down from around 5.7980
on Sunday.
 The benchmark EGX30 share index <.EGX30> dipped 2.2 percent,
its biggest decline since June 22, 2010, with index heavyweights
Commercial International Bank  and Citadel Capital
 falling 2.7 and 3.3 percent respectively.
 The index reached an eight-month high early this month but
has steadily weakened since then.
 ""There's a bit of a strong market correction, with a
catalyst being the contagion factor from Tunisia, especially
after the man went to parliament and tried to burn himself,""
said Mohamed Seddiek, senior research manager at Prime
Securities.
 Saddiek said Egyptian equities were still trading at 11
times estimated 2011 earnings, which seemed quite expensive.
 An Egyptian Facebook group has called for street protests on
Jan. 25, calling it a ""Day of Revolution against torture,
poverty, corruption and unemployment"".
 ""This might be a good buying opportunity,"" said Seddiek.
""People might be angry but ... I believe government reforms, and
the gradual removal of subsidies, will continue on track.""

 * Shares in joint ventures with foreign firms to be sold
 
 By Paul Taylor
 PARIS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Tunisia's economy will be purged
legally of the tentacular grip of overthrown president Zine
el-Abedine Ben Ali's extended family, and is well placed to
flourish, a leading Tunisian economist said on Monday.
 Moncef Cheikhrouhou, forced to sell his shares in a family
press group to a relative of the president and go into exile in
2000, said a commission created by the Justice Ministry would
unravel assets acquired through nepotism and corruption.
 ""They behaved like a mafia that reaped money from all
sectors of the Tunisian economy,"" Cheikhrouhou told Reuters in
an interview in Paris, where he teaches international finance at
the elite HEC business school.
 ""For example, all car imports had to be controlled by the
family. Tunisians who wanted to import new brands either had to
give a majority stake to a member of the family without paying,
or hand over a rake-off on the profits,"" he said.
 Cheikhrouhou said Tunisia had a young entrepreneurial class
eager to create wealth and jobs once the suffocating hand of the
ruling clan was removed from the economy, and a competent civil
service capable of administering the country.
 A World Bank estimated that Tunisia's growth rate could be
raised by two or three percentage points from 4 percent a year
to India's level if corruption and nepotism were removed, he
said.
 Cheikhrouhou, 65, vice-president of the Circle of Arab
Economists, is close to reformist opposition figures forming a
coalition government and is seen as a possible finance or
economy minister in a democratic administration.
 ""Tunisia isn't starting from zero,"" he said, noting that
some 1,350 French companies and 300-400 Italian firms, as well
as some big U.S. enterprises, had set up a presence in the North
African state of 10 million people, which has a free-trade
agreement for goods with the European Union.
 
 FLAGRANT
 Many foreign firms that did business in Tunisia were forced
to enter into partnership with relatives of Ben Ali and his wife
Leila's Trabelsi family, which would now have to be unwound.
 ""We are trying to make sure that the rule of law prevails in
Tunisia,"" he said.
 ""I expect this commission will receive an enormous number of
demands for compensation. The most flagrant cases, the Trabelsi
and Chiboub families, will be treated more simply like money
laundering cases,"" Cheikhrouhou said.
 The Chiboub family are related to Ben Ali by marriage to one
of his daughters. 
 Several members of the Trabelsi family have been arrested or
attacked since Ben Ali and his wife fled abroad last Friday.
 Cheikhrouhou said he had learned from the central bank that
the ex-president's family had taken 1.5 tonnes of gold worth $66
million out of the country. Militia men loyal to Ben Ali had
tried to raid the central bank on Sunday to remove more gold but
had been repulsed by the army, he said.
 Illustrating how foreign investment worked under Ben Ali, he
cited the example of French do-it-yourself chain Bricorama,
which had moved into Tunisia by making a partnership with a
member of the Trabelsi family.
 ""Legally, we will have to find Bricorama another partner.
The shares will be sold to bidders in an open process,"" he said.
 Protesters attacked or looted several French-owned
businesses, including Carrefour and Monoprix supermarkets,
during the Tunisian unrest.
 Cheikhrouhou said the attacks were due to anger at French
President Nicolas Sarkozy's longstanding support for Ben Ali,
whom Paris refused to criticise until the day before he fled,
but would not last now the dictatorship had been overthrown.
 He noted there had been no attacks on tourists or hotels.
Tourism is the country's biggest foreign currency earner, with
6.9 million arrivals in 2009, according to the World Tourism
Organisation.

214,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2011 07:36AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-How China promotes its green sector," (This factbox accompanies a story on tensions between solar
producers in the West and China)
 
 Jan 17 (Reuters) - China has emerged as a world leader in
the manufacture of solar photovoltaic technology, and could soon
be the largest supplier of wind turbines, thanks in part to
state laws and directives that reward renewable energy equipment
companies with cash and tax perks.
 Those state polices are now under scrutiny. The United
States is seeking talks with China at the World Trade
Organization (WTO) over wind power incentives which it calls
""illegal subsidies""; it is contemplating a separate action on
solar incentives.
 China, which joined the WTO in 2001, has expressed
willingness to open discussion with the United States on the
wind power complaint.
 Western countries also subsidize green technology. But
western firms argue such aid is primarily designed to boost the
spread of green power. Chinese aid, they complain, is designed
mostly to help Chinese companies and shut out foreign firms.
 The following measures targeting green technology form part
of a larger fabric of laws and regulations that help promote the
growth of Chinese companies:
 * Ride the Wind Program (1996) promoted wind equipment
production. European firms were invited to enter joint ventures
with local firms and share technology in exchange for market
access. A National Debt Wind Power Program (1999) complemented
the plan by extending loan rate subsidies to wind farm owners
purchasing locally made wind power components.
 * Government Procurement Law (2002) encouraged a ""buy
domestic"" culture in state-owned entities in their purchase of
equipment or approval of projects including the renewable energy
industry.
 * Administration of Wind Power Construction (2005) required
that at least 70 percent of all equipment used in new wind farms
be made in China. Beijing removed the local-content rule in
2009, but state-owned companies may still prefer Chinese-made
equipment.
 * Renewable Energy Law (2006) required utilities to purchase
electricity from renewable energy sources, while establishing
other incentives for the sector including preferential rates on
loans.
 * Provisional Measures for the Accreditation of National
Indigenous Innovation Products (NIIP) (2006) gives priority to
solar, wind and other key technologies developed in China in
state procurement programs.
 * Export Product Research and Development Fund offers loan
discounts and capital support for R&D products in high-tech
goods for export. Wind turbines and solar products were added to
the revised list in 2006. A company must export 50 percent or
more of its output, or record export sales of at least $15
million to be eligible for the grant. China's biggest solar
firms export about 95 percent of their output yearly.
 * Special Fund for Wind Power Manufacturing (2008) extends
cash grants of about 600 yuan a kilowatt, or about 5-10 percent
of the cost of a wind turbine, to developers using locally
developed technology and components.
 * China's $586 billion economic Stimulus Package (2008)
allocated a major portion of government spending to renewable
energy projects.

sure our first step in there is at a set of economics that make
this project viable, and define viable economics in the future,""
says First Solar board member TK Kallenbach, who heads up the
company's business development in China.
 
 TACTICAL PLAY?
 With costs for solar modules falling fast, some industry
experts have speculated that China could simply drag out any WTO
process until its companies are strong enough to stand on their
own. 
 It's a risky game -- for all concerned. If the United States
lodges a complaint and proves that China wrongly boosted its
companies, Washington could ""retaliate to the extent of the
damage that we allege they have caused,"" says Carla Hills, a
former U.S. Trade Representative who battled with Japan, Brazil
and India over trade and led negotiations that led to the NAFTA
trade treaty. But a formal complaint could trigger a trade war
that the Chinese government has said would hit an industry
crucial to tackling climate change. ""If the U.S. closes the door
for trading with the rest of the world, including China, in
renewable energy products, the U.S. may significantly delay the
already long struggle for developing alternative energy sources,
if not entirely destroy this opportunity for humankind,"" China
said in a written response to the USW complaint.
 That sort of rhetoric does not sit well in Finow, where
German workers saw few benefits from the huge solar plant.
""Economically, this (plant) had no impact on our region,"" one of
the owners of Finow airport said on condition of anonymity,
because of the sensitivity of the topic. ""No jobs were created
as the installation work was mainly done by eastern Europeans.""
The park is set for expansion this year. But, says Kobbe, ""I
doubt that they'll use German modules this time.""

 By Kirsten Donovan
 LONDON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Spanish bonds fell on Monday,
helping Bunds to reverse earlier losses, after Madrid launched a
syndicated bond sale which weighed on Spanish yields and pulled
other struggling euro zone issuers down.
 Attention was mainly focused on the euro zone finance
ministers' meeting, however, where an increase in the effective
lending capacity of the EU rescue fund is expected to dominate
discussions.
 But senior European sources told Reuters Germany is pushing
for broader anti-crisis measures to be agreed at a summit of
European Union leaders in March.
 ""It is unlikely anything will be decided this week, although
there may be some encouraging discussions to keep the market
optimistic on progress,"" said Everett Brown, rate strategist at
IDEAGlobal. 
 Europe has responded to a debt crisis that has forced Greece
and Ireland to take bailouts with a safety net fund that can
borrow on the market with euro zone government guarantees of up
to 440 billion euros. 
 But with at least Portugal widely expected also to need
financial help, markets are looking for new measures.
 ""The market is looking for something and it may be an
anti-climax. A disappointment could weigh on the periphery and
give some support to Bunds,"" said a trader.
 The trader added that a debut debt issue by the European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), which is expected this
week, could give some support to the periphery if it went well
and showed there was a good market for such paper.
 March Bund futures were flat at 124.91, having earlier
fallen as low as 124.47. Two-year bond yields were down almost 5
bps at 1.112 percent, with 10-year yields down 1.2 bps at 3.024
percent.
 The 2/10 German yield curve flattened around 20 basis points
last week after tough talk on inflation from the ECB prompted
markets to bring forward expectations for rises in interest
rates.
 The front-end of the curve outperformed on Monday after ECB
policymaker Athanasios Orphanides told Bloomberg News there was
sometimes an ""overreaction to the underlying message"" from the
ECB. The ECB's statement last Thursday was not ""overly hawkish"",
he said.
 
 TAKE YOUR CHANCE
 Analysts said the rise in Spanish yields reflected a
cheapening ahead of the sale rather than any concerns over
Madrid's ability to raise funds. 
 They said Spain's cancelling of an scheduled debt auction on
Thursday in favour of the 10-year syndicated bond, was a sign of
its optimism after relatively successful auctions last week.
 A target amount of up to 5 billion euros would be similar to
a sale by Spain last January. That issue, however, was priced at
around 50 basis points over mid-swaps -- compared to guidance of
225 basis points for this week's syndication.
 ""This is part of what we said about (Spain) being more
cautious and more defensive and waiting for the right market
circumstances to do the issues,"" said Ioannis Sokos, rate
strategist, BNP Paribas, London.
 ""The general appetite (for the periphery) is a bit better
because we have the discussions about the new shape of the EFSF
--- whether it can buy bonds, if they're going to increase the
size -- all this talk is helping the peripherals perform.
 Belgium is also seeking an opportunity to place debt with a
syndicate of banks and Portugal plans one for the first quarter,
as fiscally stretched sovereign issuers elsewhere in Europe also
seek to cut spiralling financing costs.
 Syndications may give issuers the chance to appeal to a
wider market and achieve lower yields. 
 Well-received Spanish, Portuguese and Italian bond sales
last week eased investors' worst fears about their ability to
fund themselves.
 Spanish 10-year government bond yield spreads over Bunds
were 4 basis points wider on the day at 236 bps, having narrowed
around 35 basis points last week.
 ""We could be stabilising or it could be a false dawn,""
IDEAGlobal's Brown said.
 ""But the underlying credit-worthiness issue is still there
although it could be mitigated if countries start to see
significant economic growth.""
 U.S. markets are closed on Monday.

and as investors reassessed a recent rise in European Central

 Uncertainty about whether Germany would support an increase
in the lending capacity of the rescue fund, known as the

 Europe set up the safety net fund, which can borrow on the
markets with euro zone government guarantees of up to 440

and Ireland to take bailouts last year. But a new package of
anti-crisis measures is seen as unlikely to come any time soon.

aren't going to go away. But higher rates and a cobbled together

the long run,"" said Ian Stannard, senior currency strategist at
BNP Paribas.
 Spain cancelled a proposed bond auction slated for later in
the week on Monday, opting for a syndicated bond issue instead,
which rattled investor confidence and gave another reason to
sell the euro as peripheral bond spreads widened over German
benchmarks.
 It fell 1 percent on the day to 109.76 yen, down from
Friday's one-month high of 110.99 yen. Versus the Swiss franc
it was down 0.6 percent and against the pound the euro shed 0.9
percent.
 The dollar was fetching 82.66 yen, down 0.3 percent on the
day from late U.S. trade on Friday and within its well-worn

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against the
dollar on Monday while global stocks dipped as hopes of swift
action from policymakers to boost the euro zone's rescue fund
faded ahead of a meeting of finance ministers.
 A debate on increasing the effective lending capacity of the
European Financial Stability Facility is expected to dominate
the meeting, but concerns about whether officials can reach
agreement weighed on market sentiment.
 The euro extended falls as European Central Bank policymaker
Athanasios Orphanides was quoted saying the market may have
overreacted to the ECB's statement last week. The bank's warning
on inflation had prompted investors to bring forward bets on the
timing of a first rise in euro zone interest rates, sending the
euro to a one-month high.
 ""Expectations for tighter ECB monetary policy measures
aren't going to go away. But higher rates and a cobbled together
rescue package for the euro zone aren't positive for the euro in
the long run,"" said Ian Stannard, senior currency strategist at
BNP Paribas.
 The euro lost 0.4 percent on the day against the dollar at
$1.3316, having rallied some 4 percent last week to a high of
$1.3458 on Friday. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar
was up 0.1 percent at 79.249.
 Ministers will discuss an increase in the fund, but there
was a growing realisation that a deal was not imminent, with
France saying it would be March before a firm plan was in place.

 ""It's becoming increasingly apparent that Germany doesn't
want an increase in the rescue fund and that's weighing on euro
sentiment today because there were positive expectations
building last week,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at
UBS in Zurich.
 Some analysts pointed to a Feb. 4 European Council meeting
as a more likely stage for such decisions to be made, though
this week's meeting should give investors a sense of how much
agreement there is among euro zone members to enlarging the
facility.
 German Bund futures were 6 ticks higher at 124.96. They cut
earlier losses while bonds of the euro zone's peripheral issuers
sold off after Spain announced a syndicated bond sale with a
target size of 4-5 billion euros.
 
 GLOBAL STOCKS, COMMODITIES WEAK
The MSCI world equity index was down 0.1 percent at 337.13,
off a 28-month high of 337.68 touched overnight as last week's
rally petered out.
 With U.S. markets closed on Monday, the focus was on events
in Europe, with news that Spain was opting for the syndicated
sale of its debt instead of an open auction driving its bond
yields back up after a recovery in recent sessions.
 European shares, however, edged up 0.1 percent, lifted by
gains in oil shares and a surge in British engineering firm
Smiths Group after it rejected a bid for its medical services
unit, which offset falls in mining stocks.
 Oil stocks were led higher by BP following the share swap
and arctic exploration deal that the London-based oil major
signed with Russia's Rosneft late on Friday. 
 Commodity prices were broadly lower on a firmer dollar and
ahead of the euro zone meeting.
 U.S. crude oil was down 30 cents at $91.24 a barrel, while
ICE Brent for March lost 37 cents to $98.01, staying not far
below $100, a level not seen since the beginning of October
2008.
 ""The oil price has been in an uptrend since the middle of
November and now we are getting close to $100. The weather in
the northern hemisphere has turned a bit milder, and the end of
winter is in sight. It's either pausing or going to retrace,""
said Christopher Bellew at broker Bache Commodities.
 Copper prices were lower, though gold prices held steady
around $1,359.80 an ounce, underpinned by physical buying ahead
of the Chinese new year.

(Adds comment, table)
 TOKYO, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The value of investment trust
funds targeting Japanese retail investors edged up to an
eight-month high in December as strength in global shares
prompted solid inflows, an industry body said on Monday.
 Still, the yen's rise against the dollar and the euro during
the month hurt the overall performance, with the value rising
only 0.9 percent, or 32.1 billion yen, to 63.7 trillion yen
($768 billion) in December from the previous month, the
Investment Trusts Association of Japan said.
 Market participants closely watch the market for these
funds, known as toushin, as it is larger than the economies of
nations such as Turkey and Indonesia.
 ""The rise of the yen generally hurt the performance (of the
funds in December), limiting gains in value,"" Fumio Inui, the
association's vice president, told a news conference.
 The yen climbed 3 percent against the dollar in December,
cutting into the value of investment trust funds invested in
foreign equities and bonds.
 Meanwhile, solid gains in share prices helped lift the
overall value of toushin, with the broader Topix index climbing
4.4 percent and the key Nikkei average advancing 2.9 percent.
 On an annual basis, the value rose 3.7 percent in 2010 after
jumping 17.7 percent in 2009.
 ""The value has edged higher on an annual basis, but I have
to say that the market was far more volatile throughout the year
than I had expected, with factors such as the European debt
crisis sharply driving markets,"" Inui said.
 ""The outlook for this year is unclear, although I feel that
the overall trend of investors shifting into investments from
deposits will continue,"" he said.
 INFLOWS
 The toushin market has seen net inflows for 21 consecutive
months as retail investors seek higher returns and look to
diversify their portfolios into financial products from
low-yielding bank and postal deposits.
 Net inflows from retail investors climbed 4.4 percent to
536.6 billion yen in December from the previous month.
 Net inflows in 2010 doubled to 6 trillion yen as investors
shifted part of their savings into funds of hedge funds and
other overseas mutual funds.
 Steady inflows into funds of hedge funds by retail investors
pushed their value beyond 20 trillion yen in December for the
first time since December 2007.
 The market has seen net inflows for seven years in a row.
 Following is a breakdown of the December data:
 Net money flow (in yen):

 (Adds quote, changes lead, dateline, previous TOKYO)
LONDON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on Monday
on fading expectations that talks on the euro zone's sovereign
safety net will provide any meaningful way to help solve its
debt crisis, prompting speculators to sell the currency.
 Uncertainty about whether Germany would support an increase
in the lending capacity of the rescue fund, known as the
European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), clouded sentiment
towards the euro.
 Europe responded to the debt crisis that has forced Greece
and Ireland to take bailouts with a safety net fund that can
borrow on the market with euro zone government guarantees of up
to 440 billion euros, but analysts say a new package of
anti-crisis measures is unlikely to come any time soon.
 Attention is focused on the euro zone's finance ministers'
meeting on Monday, where an increase in the effective lending
capacity of the rescue fund is expected to dominate discussion.

 Senior European sources told Reuters the sense of urgency in
Berlin for boosting the fund had diminished after successful
bond auctions last week in Spain and Portugal, the two countries
seen most at risk of a bailout following rescues of Greece and
Ireland last year.
 Instead Germany is pushing for broader anti-crisis measures
to be agreed at a summit of European Union leaders in March.
 ""It's becoming increasingly apparent that Germany doesn't
want an increase in the rescue fund and that's weighing on euro
sentiment today because there were positive expectations
building last week,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at
UBS in Zurich.
 ""We believe the euro is a sell on rallies because investors
are not minded to buy euro denominated assets while structural
problems in the euro zone persist,"" he added.
 The euro traded at $1.3283, down around 0.7 percent on the
day after failing to sustain a break above its 100-day moving
average at $1.3416 last week.
 It was off a one-month high of $1.3458 hit as speculators
went long after solid debt auctions from Spain and Portugal,
hawkish comments on inflation from European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet and hopes that euro zone policy
makers may expand their rescue funds.
 Traders said euro-selling by Japanese exporters was a factor
weighing on the single European currency, which fell 0.7 percent
to 110.16 yen, down from Friday's one-month high of 110.99 yen.
 Market players want to see enough common ground among the
euro zone's finance ministers to suggest that some kind of
agreement is possible in coming months, said Robert Ryan, FX
strategist at BNP Paribas in Singapore.
 ""Unfortunately, what we got out of Germany over the weekend
suggests that it's going to be very difficult. It looks like the
politics in Germany are going to limit (German Chancellor
Angela) Merkel's ability to enlarge the fund significantly,""
Ryan said.
 ""I don't expect any boost to the euro today from the
meetings, and the best I think we can hope for is no negative
comments,"" Ryan added.
 
 YIELD DIFFERENTIALS SUPPORTING EURO
 One supporting factor for the currency is its increasing
yield advantage over the dollar after two-year German short-term
bond yields jumped last week following Trichet's comments on
inflation.
 That helped to push up the gap between two-year German and
U.S. yields to the highest level since late November, when the
euro was at around $1.37.
 But the euro fell broadly as talks on the bailout fund
dominated traders thoughts. It slipped around 0.4 percent versus
the Swiss franc and sterling.
 The dollar was fetching 82.90 yen, close to flat on the day
from late U.S. trade on Friday and within its well-worn range in
the past weeks. Traders said a U.S. public holiday may serve to
limit volatility on the day.

 * 80 pct of funds must be invested in bonds -sources
 * Move aimed at increasing international use of yuan
(Adds quotes, background)	
 By Victoria Bi and Farah Master	
 HONG KONG, Jan 17 (Reuters) - China's securities regulator
will begin a trial programme that for the first time allows
local fund houses to raise money offshore for investment in the
domestic financial market, two sources said.	
 At least 80 percent of the money raised will have to be
invested in the domestic bond market, said the two sources who
are familiar with the matter but who are not authorised to
publicly disclose the details.	
 ""The move is based on the overall financial trend of the
yuan increasingly becoming more international,"" one of the
sources said on Monday. ""The banks are already moving forward in
this aspect and it's time for brokerages and securities firms to
follow suit.""	
 Mini-QFII takes after the 8-year-old QFII programme, which
allows foreign fund managers to invest in Chinese stocks and
bonds on behalf of foreign investors using money raised
overseas.	
 Frances Cheung, strategist at Credit Agricole in Hong Kong,
said the presence of foreign investors would help increase
liquidity in the bond market.	
 ""On the one hand there is concern about equity market
bubbles, and on the other it is always good to have more foreign
participants in the bond market because it can help boost
secondary market liquidity with more trade ideas,"" she said.	
 
 Speaking at a financial forum in Hong Kong on Monday, Shang
Fulin, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission
(CSRC), said China would continue to open its monetary and
financial markets.	
 ""For renminbi assets, we are going to open the mainland
market up more for Hong Kong enterprises, collaborate more with
the Hong Kong Exchange and work out better settlement
regulations and arrangements,"" Shang told the forum.	
 Chinese brokerages with international arms such as Guotai
Junan are expected to participate in the mini-QFII
programme.	
 ""Most of the money will be allowed to invest in the bond
markets, so as to ensure stable development of the trial
programme,"" one of the sources said.	
 China has been trying to make its yuan currency more
international by establishing Hong Kong as a offshore yuan
centre.	
 It will also trying to come up with new ways to use the yuan
beyond current options, which are now largely limited to
depositing money into offshore yuan accounts and buying
yuan-denominated bonds issued outside China. 
 Shang, said the CSRC would push closer cooperation
and increase the scope of development with Hong Kong. ""We will
also arrange steps for the exchange traded fund (ETF) mechanism
and support the development in Hong Kong of renminbi bonds,"" he
said .

230,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2011 03:32AM ET</span>",Euro zone eyes plan for revised EFSF by March-Lagarde," PARIS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The rescue fund for troubled euro
zone states needs to be replaced and reinforced, and a draft
agreement on the revised form it should take should be in place
by March, French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on
Monday.
 Euro zone countries are in agreement on the broad principles
for updating the European Financial Stability Fund, Lagarde told
Europe 1 radio.
 ""It needs to be replaced and reinforced. We have started
talks...and agree on the big principles, we are looking at how
it could be applied,"" she said.
 The EFSF can borrow on the market with euro zone government
guarantees of up to 440 billion euros.
 But because it wants to maintain a triple A credit rating,
the effective amount it can lend to countries in need is only
around 250 billion euros, which would not be enough to cover
requests for outside help from Portugal and Spain.
 ""We need a global solution. We can't have a little hike here
and some flexibility there, a reinforcement of discipline. We
will need a complete package and I hope that we will submit one
in March,"" Lagarde said.
 The European Commission and the European Central Bank called
last week for boosting the effective capacity of the EFSF as
well as expanding its scope of operations. Germany, the biggest
euro zone economy, is key to any agreement on changes.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday any further
measures to stabilise the euro could only be introduced within a
complete strategic package also aiming for stronger economic
coordination. [ID:nLDE70G059]

(Adds analysts' comments, more background, updates stock price)
 By Katie Reid 
 ZURICH, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Outgoing ThyssenKrupp finance
chief and turnaround expert Alan Hippe will take control of
Roche's coffers as the Swiss drugmaker seeks to get rid of debt
and embarks on cost cuts after product setbacks.
 Hippe, familiar with the tough business environments of the
steel and auto sectors, is joining Roche as the pharma industry
faces some of its toughest challenges and as the group tries to
reduce debt after its Genentech buyout.
 Hippe, 44, will become a member of Roche's Corporate
Executive Committee in April, Roche said on Monday, joining from
Europe's largest stainless steel company, where he was credited
with its successful restructuring.
 At 1131 GMT, Roche stock was trading 1.5 percent higher,
outperforming the STOXX Europe 600 Healthcare index, while
shares in ThyssenKrupp were 1.3 percent lower as investors
lamented Hippe's departure.
 
 STRONG TRACK RECORD
 Hippe joined ThyssenKrupp in April 2009 fresh from his
success in repairing automotive supplier Continental AG's
business, where he came to grips with the new plants' spiralling
costs, endearing him to many in the investment community.
 The German national, who was only 35 when he became CFO at
Continental, also managed a 2.5 billion euros ($3.3 billion)
financing deal with creditor banks, easing Continental's tight
liquidity situation caused by its takeover of Siemens' VDO unit
in 2007.
 At ThyssenKrupp, he pushed for restructuring and
cost-cutting measures and he also stabilised the company's
investment grade rating by managing cash flows -- not an easy
task due to the huge capex requirements at its new steel plant
project in the United States.
 Investors are hoping Hippe will now help Roche to boost its
efficiency and pay down the large debt pile it amassed after its
$46.8 billion buyout of U.S. biotech group Genentech. Roche's
net debt position as of June 30, 2010 was 27.5 billion francs.
 ""The real challenge is to bring down the debt after the
Genentech deal so that they have more strategic flexibility. At
the moment, Roche can't go for any significant M&A to shore up
its pipeline because it is too leveraged,"" Helvea analyst
Karl-Heinz Koch said.
 
 SICKLY PHARMA
 The pharmaceutical sector is facing tough times as companies
struggle with price pressures, patent expiries on top-selling
drugs, more competition from biosimilars -- copycat versions of
complex biotech medicines -- and difficulties in getting new
drugs to the market.
 These issues and a spate of product disappointments mean
Roche, the world's largest maker of cancer drugs, is now seeking
to hack 2.4 billion Swiss francs ($2.5 billion) from annual
costs from 2012 onwards with 1.8 billion francs of savings
expected this year.
 ""The announced cost-savings programme for this year could
soon evaporate as they deal with a 500 million franc hit to the
top and bottom lines from price pressure and lose between 500
million and 1 billion francs in sales from Avastin in breast
cancer,"" Helvea's Koch said.
 Investors are also awaiting the results of a study of
Roche's Lucentis in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
versus Avastin, which Koch estimated could result in the group
taking another hit of 500 million to 1 billion francs if Avastin
is found to be as effective as Lucentis.
 
 INDUSTRY HEAVYWEIGHTS
 Hippe's appointment comes after Roche said industry
heavyweights Royal Dutch Shell CEO Peter Voser and Lufthansa
head Christoph Franz would stand for election to its board.
 Analysts like Hippe's open communications style and the high
level of detail in his financial reports.
 Hunziker, a Swiss national, has held the CFO position at
Roche since 2001 and under his reign Roche gained credit ratings
with Standards & Poors and Moody's, helping the group to finance
the Genentech deal under more favourable conditions during the
financial crisis.
 Hunziker, born in 1953, will now focus on a number of board
memberships.

 He also dismissed media reports that there was no clear
position on the matter within Chancellor Angela Merkel's
centre-right government, and denied that French President
Nicolas Sarkozy was in favour of an increase in the fund.
 ""That's naturally the usual incorrect reporting -- we are
all in agreement that there is no need to act at present... and
Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy have said very clearly
they oppose an increase in the bailout fund,"" he said.

 * Says China must accelerate rate hikes, yuan appreciation
 * Yen likely to weaken versus dollar - Watanabe
(Adds quotes, details)
 By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Izumi Nakagawa
 TOKYO, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Former Japanese currency policy
chief Hiroshi Watanabe said Japan must be wary about boosting its
euro bond buying beyond the size of the euro holdings in its
foreign reserves, as it could end up selling dollars, which would
lift the yen and hurt its economy.
 Watanabe, who was Japan's top financial diplomat for three
years to July 2007, also said China should accelerate the pace of
rate hikes and yuan revaluation to reign in inflation and prevent
overheating of its economy.
 Last week, Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said Japan would
purchase euro zone bonds to bolster confidence in the European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), a new lending scheme to
assist ailing European economies such as Ireland.
 Japan is considering buying over 20 percent of the euro zone
bonds to be issued jointly later this month to raise funds to
support Ireland, using euros from its foreign reserves.
 ""I believe it should be based on the stance of keeping it
within Japan's euro liquidity,"" Watanabe told Reuters when asked
if Japan should consider boosting its euro bond buying.
 ""If Japan says it will sell the dollar to buy the euro, it
would boost the yen rather than supporting the euro. That would
be tough under the current economic situation,"" said Watanabe,
now the president of Japan Bank for International Cooperation
(JBIC).
 Countries such as China, which has dollars, euros and yen in
its reserves, could sell yen to buy euros, Watanabe said, but
Japan could be in a position where it had no choice but to sell
dollars to buy euros so very careful debate would be needed
before it boosted its euro bond buying further.
 A strong yen has dealt a blow to the export-reliant Japanese
economy since last year, but Watanabe said the Japanese currency
is likely to gradually weaken against the dollar if the U.S.
economy stays on track for 4 percent growth this year.
 Expansion in fast-growing Asian countries is likely to slow
by about 2 percentage points this year or next, but demand from
emerging economies will underpin the Japanese economy, he said.
 ""I expect Western countries to start stabilising liquidity
even though they are not ready to absorb it,"" Watanabe said. ""I
don't think excess liquidity will drive up commodity prices
further to the point where emerging economies could falter.""
 On inflation in China, Watanabe said China should raise
interest rates and revalue the yuan at a much faster pace than
last year so as to reign in inflation and bring its growth rate
to a manageable level below 9 percent.
 ""China should have raised interest rates by 0.75 percent last
year to combat inflation ... When raising rates, it should also
conduct the same degree of currency adjustments,"" Watanabe said.
 ""If the yuan does not go below 6 versus dollar, China cannot
deal with various adjustments needed. To allow for interest rate
adjustments, China should consider bringing it below 6,"" he said.
 On Monday, spot yuan was trading at 6.5921 versus the dollar
at midday, down from Friday's close of 6.5900 and having risen
3.55 percent since its mid-June de-pegging.

 By Sarah Marsh and Daniel Flynn
 BRUSSELS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers
discussed on Monday having more money in their rescue fund and
cheaper emergency loans as part of a package of measures to end
the sovereign debt crisis, but they made no firm decisions.
 The chairman of euro zone finance ministers, Jean-Claude
Juncker, said the ministers discussed many possible options
under the package, but favoured none at this stage.
 ""We started discussions on a comprehensive package of
measures to stabilise the euro zone. These talks have to
continue,"" Juncker said after a monthly meeting of the finance
ministers.
 He vowed to accelerate work on the package, but was careful
not to commit to being ready in time for the Feb. 4 or March
24-25 European Union leaders' summits.
 ""I wouldn't give a date for conclusion of our work, but the
work will be done at the highest speed possible,"" Juncker said.
 He said the ministers discussed a European Commission
proposal to increase the effective lending capacity of the euro
zone rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility
(EFSF) to 440 billion euros, from about 250 billion now.
 The 440 billion euros was the initial sum agreed to by euro
zone countries when the EFSF was set up in May 2010, but it
later turned out that because of the need to secure a triple-A
credit rating, its effective lending capacity was much smaller.
 ""The decision taken in May said that the facility will make
440 billion euros available. We are looking at the different
ways we can actually do that,"" Juncker said.
 Markets want to see more money available in the EFSF because
they estimate the current amount would not be sufficient if both
Portugal and Spain applied for euro zone emergency financing --
which some see as a possibility.
 
 EFFECTIVE LENDING CAPACITY INCREASE
 Juncker praised budget consolidation and reform efforts of
both Lisbon and Madrid and said markets had noted them too.
 ""Markets remain volatile, but related developments were
encouraging. The spreads on sovereigns have moved in ways that
illustrate this. The measures taken so far seem to be working,
particularly those measures taken in Portugal and Spain, because
those measures seem to have borne fruit,"" he said.
 The rescue fund is already financing Ireland and the euro
zone also has bilateral loan commitments to bankroll Greece for
three years. EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli
Rehn was optimistic on boosting the EFSF's firepower.
 ""I am confident that the effective lending capacity of the
EFSF will be expanded,"" he told reporters.
 Juncker also said that there was a general discussion about
cheaper loans from the EFSF to countries cut off from market
financing. The EFSF now adds a punitive 300 basis point margin
for its loans on top of the average market rate.
 ""We were discussing in general terms the question of lowering
the interest rate for countries concerned, but we did not discuss
this point in sufficient detail that I would be able to give you
the outcome of that debate,"" Juncker said.
 Many economists and policymakers believe a lower rate on
emergency loans would help the struggling countries return to
more sustainable debt levels.
 A change decided now for EFSF loans would most likely mean
lower borrowing costs also for Greece and Ireland under
programmes agreed last year, a euro zone source said.
 
 GERMANY SEES NO RUSH
 Growing realisation that a deal to widen the bailout fund
was not imminent caused the euro to retreat on Monday from a
one-month high reached after successful debt auctions by
Portugal and Spain last week.
 A Reuters poll of bank analysts across Europe found most
expect euro zone policymakers eventually to increase the
firepower of the EFSF by 260 billion euros to 700 billion.
 But German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said that
with bond markets calmer, there was no rush to take action now
and work was being prepared for a late March EU summit.
 The European Commission and the European Central Bank called
last week not only for the EFSF to have more money but also to
use it in a different way -- for example to buy government bonds
on the secondary market, like the ECB does now.
 Germany has so far opposed the idea and Juncker would not
give any details on what support that idea had among euro zone
finance ministers on Monday.
 The ECB said it bought 2.3 billion euros in euro zone
government bonds last week, its biggest weekly purchase for more
than a month. The buying helped calm markets, enabling Spain and
Portugal to stage successful auctions.
 Madrid cancelled another planned bond auction on Monday and
decided instead on a 10-year bond sale through a syndicate of
banks, to raise 6 billion euros.
 The decision would help it to sell more debt while the going
was relatively good, an analyst said, though the increased
amount meant investors pushed up Spanish risk premiums slightly.
 Belgium is also seeking an opportunity to place debt with a
syndicate of banks and Portugal plans one for the first quarter,
as fiscally stretched sovereign issuers elsewhere in Europe seek
to cut spiralling financing costs.

 * Talk of Japanese exporters selling euro vs yen
 By Hideyuki Sano and Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO/SINGAPORE, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The euro hovered below a
one-month high on Monday, with market players saying clearer
signs of progress on the euro zone's sovereign safety net are
needed for the currency to make significant gains.
 Traders suspect a large portion of the bets against the euro
were cleared in a big bout of short-covering last week,
suggesting limited gains in the near-term.
 Europe responded to the debt crisis that has forced Greece
and Ireland to take bailouts with a safety net fund that can
borrow on the market with euro zone government guarantees of up
to 440 billion euros, but analysts say a new package of
anti-crisis measures is both essential and urgent.
 Attention is focused on the euro zone's finance ministers'
meeting on Monday, where an increase in the effective lending
capacity of the rescue fund is expected to be dominate
discussion. [ID:nLDE70F09T]
 ""There could be a further upside for the euro if confidence
in the rescue scheme grows. But I think the euro has already
risen to pretty good levels,"" said a trader for a Japanese trust
bank in Tokyo.
 The euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.3332 , off a one-month
high of $1.3458 hit on Friday. The euro's rally last week
stalled after it rose on Friday to levels above $1.3404, a 38.2
percent retracement of its November to January slide.
 Traders said euro-selling by Japanese exporters was a factor
weighing on the single European currency, which fell 0.4 percent
to 110.54 yen , down from Friday's one-month high of
110.99 yen.
 Uncertainty about whether Germany would support an increase
in the lending capacity of the rescue fund, known as the
European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), clouded the euro's
outlook.
 Market players want to see enough common ground among the
euro zone's finance ministers to suggest that some kind of
agreement is possible in coming months, said Robert Ryan, FX
strategist at BNP Paribas in Singapore.
 ""Unfortunately, what we got out of Germany over the weekend
suggests that it's going to be very difficult. It looks like the
politics in Germany are going to limit (German Chancellor
Angela) Merkel's ability to enlarge the fund significantly,""
Ryan said.
 ""I don't expect any boost to the euro today from the
meetings, and the best I think we can hope for is no negative
comments,"" Ryan added.
 The euro staged a sharp comeback last week from a
four-month low of $1.2860, helped by solid debt auctions from
Spain and Portugal, hawkish comments on inflation from Trichet
and hopes that euro zone policy makers may expand their rescue
funds.
 YIELD DIFFERENTIALS SUPPORTING EURO
 One supporting factor for the currency is its increasing
yield advantage over the dollar after two-year German short-term
bond yields  jumped last week following Trichet's
comments on inflation.
 That helped to push up the gap between two-year German and
U.S. yields to the highest level since late November, when the
euro was at around $1.37.
 ""In terms of yield differentials, the euro could rise a bit
more,"" said Koji Fukaya, chief FX strategist at Credit Suisse.
 ""But market players would need more euro positive factors to
go long on the euro. It seems difficult to see the euro rising
above $1.35 in the short term,"" he added.
 Many market players expect the currency to meet hefty
resistance around $1.35, its Dec. 14 high. Its 90-day moving
average comes in at $1.3489.
 The dollar was fetching 82.90 yen , up 0.1 percent
from late U.S. trade on Friday and within its well-worn range in
the past weeks.
 The Australian dollar dipped 0.2 percent to $0.9870
, having fallen sharply on Friday after China's central
bank raised lenders' required reserves by 50 basis points,
though it is off last week's one-month low of $0.9803.

* Scheme will benefit domestic Chinese brokerages 
* Foreign investors to get a new China investment option 
* Initial quotas under the scheme likely to be small 
* Scheme part of broader yuan internationalisation drive

HONG KONG, Jan 17 (Reuters) - China's securities regulator will begin a trial
programme that allows local fund houses to raise money offshore for investment
in the domestic financial market, two sources said on Monday. 
The programme, known locally as ""mini-QFII"", will let Chinese fund managers
compete with western players such as Franklin Templeton and Invesco .	
At least 80 percent of the money raised will have to be invested in the
domestic bond market, said the two sources who are familiar with the matter but
who are not authorized to publicly disclose the details. 
Most analysts last year were expecting an initial cap of 20 billion yuan ($3
billion) on how much can be transferred into China under the scheme. 
Here are some questions and answers on the proposed scheme, called mini-QFII
because it is modeled after the older qualified foreign institutional investor
(QFII) program. 
 
WHAT IS MINI-QFII? 
Mini-QFII takes after the 8-year-old QFII programme, which allows foreign
fund managers to invest in Chinese stocks and bonds on behalf of foreign
investors using money raised overseas. 
Up to June last year, some 89 foreign firms including Goldman Sachs ,
JPMorgan and smaller players such as Singapore's DBS were
approved to invest in China under the QFII programme, pumping in about $17.7
billion. 
The mini-QFII scheme will allow Chinese brokerages and fund companies to do
the same under separate quotas. Most analysts had expected the overall program
to be initially capped at 20 billion yuan, with 80 percent for bonds and the
remainder for stocks. 
Under the current system, Chinese investment firms are only allowed to raise
money domestically to invest in financial markets. 
 
WHY IS CHINA INTRODUCING MINI-QFII? 
China has been trying to promote the use of its yuan currency outside its
borders in recent years, with the eventual long-term goal of displacing or at
least standing alongside the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency. 
With the establishment of Hong Kong as an offshore yuan centre, there is now
added pressure to open up new ways to use the currency beyond the current
options.	
The mini-QFII scheme would give investors one such option, allowing them to
invest directly in China's domestic financial markets. In so doing, it would
help to raise the attractiveness of the currency to Hong Kong-based investors. 
 
WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM MINI-QFII? 
Chinese brokerages who are allowed into the scheme will be the clear winners,
while investors who already have yuan deposits sitting in banks collecting low
interest rates could also benefit if the mini-QFII funds are well managed. 
Chinese brokerages with international arms, such as Guotai Junan ,
Huatai Securities , GF Securities and Guoyuan Securities
are likely to be among the first group allowed to participate in the
scheme. 
Domestic-focused Chinese fund houses such as Nanfang, Huaxia and Haitong are
also likely to attract fresh inflows of cash upon approval of the scheme. 
Overseas investors with a higher risk appetite will also have a new
investment option as they can choose to put their money with domestic fund
houses in addition to foreign ones. 
 
HOW WILL MINI-QFII AFFECT CHINESE EQUITIES? 
The new programme will likely help sentiment on China's domestic financial
markets, but the relatively small size of the money involved means it is
unlikely to have an immediate material impact. 
Volatile Chinese markets, the relatively speculative nature of mainland
funds, underscored by higher portfolio turnover levels, and a lack of track
records overseas are some of the roadblocks for the success of the scheme. 
China's stock markets are largely dominated by retail investors due to strict
limits placed on domestic and foreign institutional investors, making them more
prone to sharp swings.

 By Victoria Bi	
 HONG KONG, Jan 17 (Reuters) - China's securities regulator
will begin a trial programme that allows local fund houses to
raise money offshore for investment in the domestic financial
market, two sources said.	
 At least 80 percent of the money raised will have to be
invested in the domestic bond market, said the two sources who

 ""The move is based on the overall financial trend of the
yuan increasingly becoming more international,"" one of the

 ""Most of the money will be allowed to invest in the bond
markets, so as to ensure stable development of the trial
programme,"" another source said.	
 China has been trying to make its yuan currency more
international by establishing Hong Kong as an offshore yuan
centre.	
 It will also trying to come up with new ways to use the yuan
beyond current options, which are now largely limited to
depositing money into offshore yuan accounts and buying
yuan-denominated bonds issued outside China.

 SYDNEY, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The euro eased on Monday as
investors waited to see if officials will agree to beef up a
euro zone safety fund, while Asian shares mostly fell, led by
drop in Shanghai in the wake of China's latest attempt to
contain inflation.	
 European Central Bank Jean-Claude Trichet gave the thumbs up
for a bigger safety-net fund on Sunday, a day before a regular
meeting of euro zone finance ministers, who are due to discuss
an increase in the effective lending capacity of the European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).	
 Some analysts played down the chances of a clear outcome
this week and pointed to a Feb. 4 European Council meeting as a
more likely stage for such decisions to be made.	
 Still, this week's meeting could give investors a better
sense of how much agreement or dissent there is among euro zone
members to enlarging the facility.	
 Any disappointment could see the euro come under renewed
pressure. For now, the euro was at $1.3330 , having
rallied some 4 percent last week to a one-month high around
$1.3456 on Friday.	
 ""There could be a further upside for the euro if confidence
in the rescue scheme grows. But I think the euro has already
risen to pretty good levels,"" said a trader for a Japanese trust
bank in Tokyo. 
 
 Meanwhile, a breach of key support took the Shanghai
Composite Index down nearly 3 percent at one stage to
lows not seen since early October. 
 The steep fall in Chinese stocks spooked other markets.
Japan's Nikkei erased most of its gains to close flat,
while shares elsewhere in Asia fell 0.6 percent .	
 South Korea's KOSPI , which hit a record high early
in the session, ended 0.4 percent lower, Hong Kong's Hang Seng
index shed 0.3 percent and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index
slid 0.8 percent. 
 Chinese bank shares were among the biggest losers after
China on Friday raised banks' required reserves (RRR) for the
fourth time in over two months.	
 On Monday, Chinese media said the central bank has devised
calibrated reserve ratios for different banks to tighten curbs
on bank lending and tame quickening inflation. 
 Investors also sold global miners like BHP Billiton
on worries China's voracious appetite for commodities will cool.
BHP fell 1.2 percent.	
 ""With growth still strong, Beijing will likely battle
inflation wholeheartedly. Get ready for more hikes in both RRR
(at least another 150 bps) and interest rates (two, 25 bps) in
the next six months,"" HSBC economists Qu Hongbin and Sun Junwei
wrote in a report.	
 According to EPFR Global, flows into the emerging market
equity funds that it tracks slowed in the week ended Jan. 12 due
to worries that high inflation rates will trigger more measures
to rein in price pressures. 
 But underlying appetite for risk persisted, with emerging
market local currency and high yield bond funds enjoying solid
weeks, EPFR noted.	
 Asian high-yield bond issuers have wasted no time this year
in taking advantage of the healthy appetite for their paper. 
 Last week, PRC property developer Evergrande Real Estate
Group made history with a 9.25 billion yuan ($1.4 billion)
synthetic renminbi bond issue, the biggest to date in the fast
growing market. 
 Commodity prices fell, with U.S. crude oil nearing
$91 a barrel, but still not far off a two-year high of around
$92.58 set early this month. 
 Copper on the London Metal Exchange eased 0.3
percent to $9,622 a tonne, within reach of a record high of
$9,754 set on Jan. 4.	
 U.S. markets are shut on Monday for a public holiday, but
the flow of earnings results will kick up a gear this week with
Apple , Citi and Goldman Sachs among major
firms due to unveil their results.

 TOKYO, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The euro hovered below a one-month
high on Monday, with market players saying clearer signs of
progress on the euro zone's safety net for sovereign debt are
necessary for the currency to make significant gains.
 Market players suspect a large portion of euro short
positions have been cleared after a big bout of short-covering
last week, suggesting limited gains in the near term.
 Attention is focused on the euro zone's finance ministers'
meeting on Monday, where an increase in the effective lending
capacity of the euro zone rescue fund is expected to be dominate
discussion.
 European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet, speaking on
a French talk show on the eve of the regular meeting of euro zone
finance ministers, said the European safety fund should be beefed
up.
 The euro traded at $1.3361, off a one-month high of $1.3458
hit on Friday but near its 55-day moving average at $1.3369.
 It staged a sharp comeback last week from a four-month low
against the U.S. currency, helped by solid debt auctions from
Spain and Portugal, hawkish comments on inflation from Trichet
and hopes that euro zone policy makers may expand their rescue

 One supporting factor for the the currency is its increasing

 Many market players expect the currency to meet hefty

average comes in at $1.3489.
 Against the Swiss franc, the euro was at 1.2880 franc, below
Friday's high of 1.2953 franc, also a one-month high.
 The euro held at 110.80 yen, also near a one-month high of
110.99 yen hit on Friday, though Tokyo traders say offers from
Japanese exporters are likely to cap the common currency.
 The dollar index against a basket of currencies remained
dangerously near its December low.
 The index stood at 79.10, not far above its Dec. 31 low of
78.775, a break of which could fan expectations of more dollar
weakness.
 On ichimoku charts, support for the index from the bottom of
cloud is at 78.538, though a fall below that level would send a
major bear signal.
 The dollar was fetching 82.80 yen, little changed and within
its well-worn range in the past weeks, though some traders say a
fall in the dollar index could knock the dollar/yen out of its
recent band to test its Jan. 3 low near 81 yen.
 The Australian dollar changed hands at $0.9898, having fallen
sharply on Friday after China's central bank raised lenders'
required reserves by 50 basis points, though it is off last
week's one-month low of $0.9803.

 In a rare written interview with two U.S. newspapers
released on Sunday, Hu called for an end to the ""zero sum"" Cold
War behavior and suggested new cooperation with the United
States. [ID:nN16247172]
 Below are some of Hu's key quotes:
 CHINA-U.S. RELATIONSHIP
 We both stand to gain from a sound China-U.S. relationship,
and lose from confrontation.
 ... We should abandon the zero-sum Cold War mentality, view
each other's development in an objective and sensible way,
respect each other's choice of development path, and pursue
common development through win-win cooperation.
 U.S. DOLLAR
 The current international currency system is the product of
the past. As a major reserve currency, the U.S. dollar is used
in considerable amount of global trade in commodities as well
as in most of the investment and financial transactions. The
monetary policy of the United States has a major impact on
global liquidity and capital flows and therefore, the liquidity
of the U.S. dollar should be kept at a reasonable and stable
level.
 CHINESE CURRENCY
 It takes a long time for a country's currency to be widely
accepted in the world. China has made important contribution to
the world economy in terms of total economic output and trade,
and the RMB has played a role in the world economic
development. But making the RMB an international currency will
be a fairly long process.
 INFLATION
 China has adopted a package plan to curb inflation,
including interest rate adjustment. We have adopted a managed
floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand
with reference to a basket of currencies. Changes in exchange
rate are a result of multiple factors, including the balance of
international payment and market supply and demand. In this
sense, inflation can hardly be the main factor in determining
the exchange rate policy.
 NORTH KOREA
 There was high tension on the Korean peninsula a few weeks
ago. China maintained close contact and coordination with other
parties and made relentless efforts to help ease the tension
and maintain peace and stability on the peninsula.
 ... Thanks to joint efforts by China and other parties,
there have been signs of relaxation. We hope that the relevant
parties will seize the opportunity to engage in active
interactions, resume the process of dialogue and consultation
as soon as possible, and ensure that the situation on the
peninsula will move forward in a positive direction.

troubles since Brian Cowen took office as prime minister
(Taoiseach):
 
 May 7, 2008 - Brian Cowen is elected prime minister as
allies and opponents warn the former finance minister he faces a
tough task steering the country through an economic slowdown.
Justice Minister Brian Lenihan becomes finance minister.
Sept. 25, 2008 - Ireland becomes first euro zone country to
slide into recession after its property bubble bursts.
 Sept. 30 - Ireland becomes one of the first countries to
respond to the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers,
approving a guarantee covering 400 billion euros ($530 billion)
of liabilities at six Irish-owned banks. The package is later
increased to 485 billion euros to cover foreign-owned banks with
significant operations in Ireland.
 Dec. 21 - Ireland agrees to inject 5.5 billion euros into
its three main banks, taking Anglo Irish Bank under its control.
 Feb. 4, 2009 - Cowen says senior executives hired to work at
banks receiving state funds should face at least a 25 percent
cut in remuneration and their salaries should be capped.
 March 30 - Standard and Poor's downgrades Ireland's credit
rating from AAA to AA+ and says it could drop further in a sign
of no-confidence. Fitch strips Ireland of its AAA credit rating
on April 8, reducing it to AA-plus.
 April 8 - Lenihan outlines 10.6 billion euros in spending
cuts for 2010-2011 and forecasts an additional 3.25 billion

 Sept. 30 - Ireland discloses a worst case price tag of more
than 50 billion euros ($68 billion) for bailing out its banks.
Oct. 6 - Fitch cuts Ireland's credit rating to A+ from AA-,
citing huge rescue costs. Fitch also says outlook negative.
 Nov. 8 - EU Economics Commissioner Olli Rehn says he has not

IMF, but say Dublin has to decide itself whether to request the
aid. It agrees to let EU, IMF and European Central Bank
technical experts visit Ireland to assess its banking problems.
 Nov. 21 - EU finance ministers welcome an Irish request for
EU financial aid as it will safeguard euro zone stability.
 Nov. 22 - EU and IMF officials begin working out details of
the rescue package. Cowen's coalition partner, the Green Party,

 * Pressure for action drops after bond auctions
 
 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers
will discuss on Monday an increase in the effective lending
capacity of the euro zone rescue fund, to draw a line under the
sovereign debt crisis before more countries need help.
 The rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility
(EFSF), can borrow money on the market with euro zone government
guarantees of up to 440 billion euros.
 But because it wants to have a triple A credit rating, the
effective amount it can lend to countries in need is only around
250 billion. A potential bid for help from Portugal and Spain
would stretch its resouces to the limit.
 The European Commission and the European Central Bank called
last week for boosting the effective capacity of the EFSF as
well as expanding its scope of operations. Germany, the biggest
euro zone economy, is key to any agreement on changes.
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble Germany,
signalled readiness to raise the effective capacity of the EFSF.
 ""We have to and will solve this problem,"" Schaeuble was
cited as saying in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.
Also France appeared open to talks on an increase in the fund's
lending capacity.
 But senior European sources told Reuters the sense of
urgency in Berlin for boosting the fund had diminished after
successful bond auctions last week in Spain and Portugal, the
two countries seen most at risk of a bailout following rescues
of Greece and Ireland last year.
 Instead Germany is pushing for broader anti-crisis measures
to be agreed at a summit of European Union leaders in March.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday any further
measures to stabilise the euro could only be introduced within a
complete strategic package also aiming for stronger economic
coordination.
 She said new measures to tackle the euro zone debt crisis
should be well thought-out and ""you cannot simply raise another
particular aspect each day"".
 ""If the discussion is about a further package of measures,
it is above all important that we develop a complete strategy
that must absolutely include closer economic coordination,""
Merkel told a news conference in Mainz after a meeting with
other senior members of her ruling Christian Democrats.
 Among the contentious issues, officials say, are France's
wish to let the EFSF buy the bonds of vulnerable euro members
which Germany does not want, and Berlin's insistence that other
members of the currency bloc be forced to introduce legislation
similar to the ""debt brake"" rule it adopted in 2009.
 Germany is also against lowering the punitive interest rate
the EFSF charges states for its loans, a step other euro zone
members believe is necessary to allow struggling economies in
the bloc to reduce their debt mountains. 
 If the margin, now 300 basis points, were to be lowered for
the EFSF, it would most likely also fall for loans already
agreed on for Ireland, as well as for Greece.
 ""The principle is to have similar conditions across
instruments and countries,"" a euro zone source said.

 By Susan Cornwell	
 WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Chinese President Hu Jintao
urged an end to a ""zero sum"" Cold War relationship with the
United States and proposed new cooperation, but resisted U.S.
arguments about why China should let its currency strengthen.	
 Indeed, in a sign that the future of the U.S. currency
continues to concern the most senior levels of the Chinese
government, he said the dollar-based international currency
system is a ""product of the past"".	
 Overall though, the president, who will visit Washington
this week, struck an upbeat tone about ties with the United
States in a rare written interview with two U.S. newspapers, the
Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post. 
 ""We should abandon the zero-sum Cold War mentality,"" he
declared, and ""respect each other's choice of development path.""	
 Hu suggested cooperation with the United States in areas
like new energy sources, clean energy, infrastructure
development, aviation and space.	
 
 He also reassured foreign businesses in China that Beijing
would continue to improve laws and regulations affecting them.	
 And he spoke encouragingly about the outlook for resolving
tensions on the Korean peninsula, an area of concern to both
Washington and Beijing.	
 But the Chinese president also indicated he does not accept
U.S. arguments for Beijing to let its currency appreciate.
Critics say China's undervaluing of the yuan gives it an unfair
price advantage in international trade, contributing to the huge
U.S. trade deficit.	
 Analysts thought Hu's generally conciliatory tone augured
well ahead of his Washington meetings with President Barack
Obama and other officials.	
 ""Hu makes it clear that China intends to move forward on
opening its markets, freeing up its exchange rate and
restructuring its political system, but at its own pace and with
little heed to external pressures for more rapid or broader
reforms,"" said Eswar Prasad, a Brookings Institution economist
and former International Monetary Fund official.	
 
 TALKING BACK TO GEITHNER	
 Last week U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said
China would be better off letting its currency strengthen to cap
inflation. 
 But Hu said China is fighting inflation with a range of
policies including interest-rate increases, and ""inflation can
hardly be the main factor in determining the exchange rate
policy.""	
 He suggested that inflation was not a big headache, saying
prices were ""on the whole moderate and controllable."" Inflation
in China hit a 28-month high in November. 
 ""We have the confidence, conditions and ability to stabilize
the overall price level,"" Hu said.	
 U.S. lawmakers are among the biggest critics of China's
exchange rate policy. Three Democratic senators -- Charles
Schumer, Debbie Stabenow, and Bob Casey -- said on Sunday that
they would propose legislation to try and fix the problem.	
 The legislation would impose stiff new penalties on
countries that the Treasury Department designated as currency
manipulators. The Treasury has not labeled any country a
currency manipulator since July 1994 when it cited China.	
 Hu called the U.S.-dollar-dominated international currency
system a ""product of the past."" He added that it would be a
""fairly long process"" to make China's own currency an
international one.	
 He also said ""the liquidity of the U.S. dollar should be
kept at a reasonable and stable level."" China has argued that
the Federal Reserve's November decision to buy $600 billion in
U.S. government bonds would undermine the greenback's value and
lead to competitive currency devaluations by other countries.
China, with foreign exchange reserves of $2.85 trillion, is the
largest holder of U.S. debt. 
 The president's comments add to the sense that China intends
to challenge the post-World War II financial order largely
created by the United States and dominated by the dollar, the
Wall Street Journal said.	
 The Chinese president responded to complaints that China
does not always treat foreign companies registered in China
fairly. ""Their innovation, production and business operations in
China enjoy the same treatment as Chinese enterprises,"" he said.	
 ""China will continue to improve laws and regulations
concerning foreign investment ...."" Hu said.	
 Bill Reinsch, president of the National Foreign Trade
Council, said Hu ""glosses over the many problems foreign
companies have had operating in China,"" but added it was useful
to have the head of China's government state its goals.	
 Questions were submitted to Hu by the two U.S. newspapers in
late December, and the answers were released by the Chinese
government on Sunday, The Washington Post said.	
 Hu said he sees ""signs of relaxation"" in tensions between
North and South Korea, an issue of major concern to both
Washington and Beijing.	
 ""Thanks to joint efforts by China and other parties, there
have been signs of relaxation,"" Hu said. He was convinced ""an
appropriate solution to the Korean nuclear issue"" could be
found, a reference to North Korea's nuclear arms programs.

 * Adds gloom to weak states in euro zone periphery
 * Strong currencies to help Switzerland, E.Europe
 
 By David Milliken and Dmitry Zhdannikov
 LONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The UK and Europe's weakest
economies are looking most at risk from a surge in crude oil to
near $100 a barrel that threatens a nascent recovery.
 The higher costs of everything from gasoline to heating oil,
jet fuel and the myriad of products that have an oil component
is a tax on growth at a time when prospects for recovery in
these countries are so fragile.
 While few analysts see oil returning to its high of $147 hit
in 2008 because of oil producers' excess capacity, crude prices
do represent a threat to the global economy and particularly to
Europe at levels even well below that.
 ""Whenever the size of the energy sector in the global
economy reached 9 percent, we went into a major crisis,"" said
Sabine Schels, a commodity analyst at Merrill Lynch.
 ""It was in the 1980s and it was the same in 2008. Right now
we are at about 7.8 percent and if you go above $100 per barrel
to $120 per barrel, you get to that 9 percent level.""
 Rising oil prices may increase pressure on the Bank of
England to raise interest rates to offset already high
inflation, some economists said.
 The weakness of the euro due to the euro zone's debt crisis
will also make the higher oil price more difficult to swallow in
weak economies such as Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain.
 By contrast, Switzerland and some East European nations will
be able to sustain the pressures due to strong currencies which
alleviate the effects of dollar-denominated oil prices rises.
 ""A couple of years ago when we had very high inflation
because of oil and utility bills, the Bank of England was able
to look through it,"" said BNP Paribas economist Alan Clarke. 
 ""But it's much harder to look through it now, when headline
inflation is over 3 percent,"" Clarke said. The BoE's last
inflation forecast assumed 2011 oil price at under $90 a barrel.
 On Friday, Brent oil futures hit $99 per barrel and U.S.
crude future were at around $90 with analysts predicting U.S.
crude would breach $100 a barrel in the first quarter of 2011

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
 PERIPHERAL WOES
 Oil at $100 a barrel would add about one percentage point to
the headline UK rate of consumer price inflation with most of
the impact coming from a steep rise in utility bills as natural
gas prices are linked to oil, estimates Clarke.
 By contrast, Italian CPI moves more slowly than in most
European states due to the disproportionate importance of excise
duties.
 Electricity and gas prices are partly administered by the
state while Italian inflation stood at 2.1 percent last year.
 For peripheral euro zone countries in general, the oil
prices rally may not lead to an increased risk of bailouts as
higher inflation could boost nominal GDP, possibly helping to
reduce ratios of sovereign debt to GDP.
 But it will nevertheless undermine attempts to regain
competitiveness in countries such as Portugal or Spain.
 ""Purchasing power will be reduced and they are already
suffering from poor labour growth prospects,"" said Marco Valli,
chief euro zone economist at UniCredit.
 
 STRONG CURRENCIES
 Germany economy minister Rainer Bruederle said on Friday he
saw no immediate threats for Germany and Europe in general.
 That echoed European Central Bank's President views that
rates were still appropriate despite upward inflationary
pressure including from energy prices
 Julian Callow, chief European economist at Barclay's
Capital, said the eurozone's GDP growth could contract by 0.2
percentage points should oil prices stay at current levels.
 ""However, we are not likely to see the end of price
increases since they tend to first come to an end when there is
either recession or significant monetary policy tightening --
neither of which is in sight,"" he said.
 Among the least hit by the oil spike economists name
Switzerland which has seen a 16-percent appreciation of the
franc against the dollar in the past six months amid low
inflation.
 ""The Swiss economy is certainly one of those economies that
suffer the least,"" said Sarasin bank's analyst Alessandro Bee.
Strong currencies will also help Poland, Hungary, Slovakia
and the Czech Republic.
 ""There is a lot of positive momentum in growth, particularly
in emerging Europe, which is benefiting hugely from German
growth,"" said Koon Chow, a strategist at Barclays.

 * Shanghai prepares for trial run on property tax
 (Adds background)
 SHANGHAI, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Shanghai hopes to encourage
foreign companies to raise capital through stock and bond
issuance in Shanghai this year, Mayor Han Zheng said on Sunday,
while also confirming the city plans a trial property tax during
2011.
 Han said Shanghai aims to launch more cross-border financial
services this year to support the central government's policy to
promote the use of the yuan in cross-border trade settlements.
 ""We will attract bond issuance and public listing of
well-established overseas companies,"" Han said in his annual work
report to the Shanghai Municipal People's congress.
 Shanghai will ""support the launch of such new products as
cross-border ETFs, income bonds, oil and lead futures,"" said Han.
The city also plans to establish an insurance exchange this year,
he said, without providing details.
 China aims to build Shanghai, its financial capital, into an
international financial centre able to compete with New York and
London.
 As part of efforts to further liberalise China's capital
markets, Shanghai has long said it will allow foreign companies
to sell shares on its stock exchange.
 Fang Xinghai, Director-General of the Shanghai Financial
Services Office, said late last year he hoped the country will
start letting foreign companies sell shares in Shanghai in 2011,
with approval processes for such listings to be made relatively
simple. [ID:nTOE6B004D]
 More than two dozen companies, including HSBC
<0005.HK> and NYSE Euronext , have said they will
seek a listing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange when the so-called
international board is launched.
 Han said one of the city's main tasks this year is to prepare
for the trial run of a property tax to curb speculative
investments in the real estate sector.
 ""We will step up macro-control measures, prioritize the
supply of non-luxury residential units to be owned and occupied
by ordinary citizens, and prepare for the trial reform on
property tax as required by the central government,"" he said.
 Shanghai will join southwestern Chongqing city, which has
said it was planning a property tax on luxury homes to combat
stubbornly high property prices.
 Housing prices in major Chinese cities surged by more than a
fifth in 2010, according to the China Real Estate Index System
(CREIS), run by Soufun , China's biggest online real
estate company. [ID:nLDE7050UU]
 But some developers believe a property tax will have limited
impact on property prices as it will not change the severe supply
shortage and strong demand in China's property
market.[ID:nTOE70B079]
 In Beijing, Mayor Guo Jinlong said at the municipal
parliament session on Sunday that the local government would aim
to reduce soaring housing prices as well as severe traffic
congestion, the Xinhua news agency reported.
""We are under heavy pressure to stabilize housing and other
retail prices, and optimize investment structure, now that a
comparatively high proportion of investment goes to the real
estate sector,"" Guo said in his government work report.
 Last April, the central government stepped up tightening
measures in the real estate sector as skyrocketing housing prices
stoked public discontent.
 The government has shut down several funding channels for
developers, raised the minimum down payments for mortgages and
capped the number of houses an individual can purchase.
 Shanghai's property market has seen transactions and prices
rising in recent weeks as sellers and buyers rush to complete
deals before a property tax.

 * Price volatility scares buyers
 
 By Svetlana Kovalyova
 VICENZA, Italy, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The volume of jewellery
exports from Italy, Europe's top producer, is expected to start
recovering in 2011 after last year's flat performance on low
2009 levels, a senior industry official said on Saturday.
 ""We hope, we expect that in 2010 we remained in line with
2009 volume levels, which were very low. That already will be a
very good signal that the bleeding has stopped,"" said Stefano de
Pascale, director of the Italian goldsmiths' body Federorafi.
 ""I hope the recovery will start in 2011,"" de Pascale told
Reuters in an interview at a key international jewellery fair in
northern Italy. He was citing preliminary industry estimates.
 Italian jewellery used to dominate the world markets, but it
has lost market share over the past seven to eight years to
rivals in China, India and Turkey. The global economic crisis of
2008-2009 also dealt it a strong blow.
 De Pascale, who in November expected a 10-12 percent fall in
2010 export volumes, said sales picked up during the crucial
Christmas period, which can account for up to 50 percent of
annual jewellery sales, especially to the U.S. market.
In value terms, Italian jewellery exports jumped 26.2
percent year-on-year to 3.22 billion euros ($4.3 billion) in the
first nine months of 2010, driven by soaring gold and silver
prices, organisers of the Vicenza fair said on Thursday.
 Stripped of the effect of surging precious metals prices,
the post-crisis recovery of Italian jewellery exports is slow
and the sector will take several years to return to pre-crisis
volumes, de Pascale said.
 
 SURGING PRICES
 A long-awaited trend reversal in export volumes will depend
on the stabilisation of metals prices, on the pace of global
economic recovery and on the easing of import duties in some key
markets such as the United States and Asia, he said.
 Gold prices rose nearly 30 percent in 2010 as economic
uncertainty and concerns over Europe's sovereign debt crisis
spurred investment in the metal as a safe haven. They hit an
all-time high above $1,430 an ounce on Dec. 7.
 De Pascale said metal price volatility and concerns that
what he described as the ""gold bubble"" may burst soon scare
wholesale and retail jewellery buyers, who are postponing orders
and refraining from rebuilding stocks nearly wiped out during
the crisis.
 Instead of making a big order at the start of a year as they
used to do in the past, buyers now place small orders throughout
the year to reduce exposure to price volatility and weak demand,
he said.
With about 70 percent of Italian jewellery sold abroad,
export volumes are a clear indication of precious metals
consumption by the jewellery industry. 
 Italy's jewellery fabrication demand for gold is estimated
to have fallen by 5-10 percent in 2010 from about 123 tonnes in
2009, dropping to about a fifth of the 1998 peak output,
according to metals consultancy GFMS. 
 ""Probably, we'll never return to the levels of the 1990s.
The market has completely changed since then, even in the way
buyers place orders,"" de Pascale said.
 The fair will run from Jan. 15 to Jan. 20 in Vicenza, a
major jewellery manufacturing centre in Italy.

 NEW YORK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - World stocks edged up on
Friday, with JP Morgan's strong earnings pushing Wall Street
higher, but China's latest move to tighten credit drove gold
to a one-week low, although oil prices rose.
 A rise in Brent crude to above $99 a barrel helped lift
U.S. oil prices despite the increase in reserve requirements
at Chinese banks. For details see:
[ID:nL3E7CE09J][ID:nTOE706030]
 Wall Street rallied, with the benchmark S&P 500 Index
posting its seventh straight week of gains after JPMorgan
Chase & Co  reported a larger-than-expected 47 percent
increase in quarterly earnings.
 Although sales at U.S. retailers rose slightly less than
expected in December, underlying inflation remained tame and
investors were cheered by other data that suggested the
recovery was modestly gathering strength. [ID:nN14146780]
 Retail sales for 2010 reversed two years of contraction
with the biggest increase in more than a decade, while the
Federal Reserve reported a surprisingly large 0.8 percent gain
in output at U.S. factories, mines and utilities in December,
helped by cold weather.
 The S&P Midcap 400 index <.MID>, which includes companies
with market caps ranging from $750 million to $3.3 billion,
surged to end the session at 931.07, an all-time closing
high.
 ""On balance, with supporting prices and in spite of mixed
economic data, there is expectation of a strong earnings
season,"" said Jim Awad, managing director at Zephyr Management
in New York.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 55.48 points,
or 0.47 percent, to close at 11,787.38. The Standard & Poor's
500 <.SPX> gained 9.48 points, or 0.74 percent, to finish at
1,293.24. The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> climbed 20.01 points,
or 0.73 percent, to end at 2,755.30.
 For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent, the S&P 500 added
1.7 percent and the Nasdaq rose 1.9 percent.
 U.S. financial markets will be closed on Monday for Martin
Luther King Jr. Day.
 The fresh tightening in Chinese monetary policy pushed
European shares lower, although more positive U.S. economic
and earnings data helped pare losses by the close.
[ID:nLDE70D21M]
 Brent crude oil rose to a 27-month peak above $99 a
barrel, as traders shrugged off China's move to restrict
lending.
 In London, ICE Brent crude for February delivery 
settled up 62 cents, or 0.63 percent, at $98.68 a barrel,
having traded as high as $99.20, the highest since October
2008. The February contract expired at the end of Friday's
trading.
 U.S. crude oil for February delivery  added 14
cents, or 0.15 percent, to settle at $91.54 a barrel.
 But gold dropped 1 percent to post its biggest two-week
loss in nearly a year after China's move to rein in inflation
and as safe-haven demand faded on a better economic outlook.
[ID:nLDE70D0Z3]
 U.S. gold futures for February delivery  lost $26.50
to settle at $1,360.50 an ounce. Spot gold  fell as low
intraday as $1,354.99 an ounce, a one-week low.
 U.S. Treasuries slipped as the rise in equity markets
boosted risk tolerance and dampened the appeal of safe-haven
U.S. government debt. [ID:nN14573969]
 Retail sales were ""fairly strong"" and thus mildly negative
for safe-haven assets like Treasuries, said Ray Humphries,
portfolio manager of The Hartford Inf lation Plus Fund
 at Hartford Investment Management Co., which has
$161.7 billion in assets under management.
 The euro headed for its best week in more than 1-1/2 years
and could extend gains next week after successful securities
auctions by indebted euro-zone members calmed fears of a
credit crisis in the region.
 The euro  was last at $1.3376, up 3.8 percent this
week and edging closer to key resistance at $1.35. Analysts
said the recovery could continue in the near term, although
gains above $1.35 may be difficult, given nervousness over the
large debt supply from weaker euro-zone economies in 2011.
 ""We're at a bit of a pivot point, but the same momentum
continues,"" said Fabian Eliasson, vice president of currency
sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York.
 The dollar slipped against a basket of major currencies,
with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> down 0.16 percent at
79.064.

 NEW YORK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The euro headed for its best
week in more than 1-1/2 years on Friday and could extend gains
next week after successful securities auctions by indebted euro
zone members calmed fears of a credit crisis in the region.
 The euro was last at $1.3374, up 3.8 percent this week and
edging closer to key resistance at $1.35. Analysts said the
recovery could continue in the near term, though gains above
$1.35 may be difficult given nervousness over large debt supply
from weaker euro zone economies in 2011.
 For now, demand for Portuguese and Spanish debt and
expectations for higher euro zone interest rates have
eradicated most concerns of fiscal woes on the euro zone
periphery.
 Add in bullish technical factors and few see the euro
ending the recent rally.
 ""We're at a bit of a pivot point but the same momentum
continues,"" said Fabian Eliasson, vice president of currency
sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York. ""There is positive
momentum from several countries' strong bond auctions. We'd
need to see something new come out"" to change direction.
 Adding support is the $199 billion jump in China's foreign
exchange reserves in the final three months last year, the most
ever for a quarter. That means China needs to put upwards of
$15 billion a month into European assets just to maintain its
current portfolio allocation.
 China has been working for years to diversify its official
currency reserves, which now sit at a record $2.85 trillion,
and the euro has been the primary alternative to the dollar,
taking an estimated 25 percent, or about $710 billion..
 ""The floor is in for the euro,"" said Douglas Borthwick, a
managing director for trading at Faros Trading LLC, a forex
execution firm in Stamford, Connecticut, who sees the euro
between $1.33 and $1.35 in the week ahead and a rally to $1.50
by year end.
 That is in in sharp contrast to his view for the U.S.
dollar, which is again mired by talk of the United States
losing its triple-A credit rating because of rising national
debt.
 ""The dollar is on a continued weakening bias, correcting
from an overbought top,"" said Borthwick.
 Technical factors will begin flashing green for the euro
rally if the euro/dollar can manage a close above the 50-day
simple moving average, Borthwick said. That level is currently
$1.3310, according to Reuters data,
 Jan. 10 saw the 50-day simple moving average move below the
100-day simple moving average, which would argue for the euro
going lower, said Borthwick.
 Indeed model accounts, those that use trading formulas for
buy and sell signals, are shorting the euro based on that
signal, but a rise in the 50-day again above the 100-day would
push model accounts to go long the euro, prompting more buying,
he said.
 The euro's gains against the dollar this week pushed it
back above the 200-day simple moving average, the third test of
that support since Nov. 29, using EBS data. To technical
analysts, the $1.3071 level is becoming major support.
 The euro received another buy signal on Thursday when the
12-day and 26-day moving average convergence/divergence line
crossed above the nine-day signal line. The MACD is used in
technical analysis as an indicator of short-term momentum by
focusing on exponential moving averages and closing prices.
 Any short covering, when investors buy the euro to cover
bets against it if it rises, is likely to further boost the
euro.
 Non-commercial speculators were net short the euro to a
total of 45,182 contracts in the week ended Jan. 11, an
increase from the 24,201 contracts the prior week, according to
data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
commitments of traders report released on Jan. 14..
 To be sure, some investors are more cautious about the
euro's prospects after the currency's rapid rise this week.
 Alan Wilde, head of fixed-income and currency at Baring
Asset Management in London, said earlier this week that
short-term there was scope to rally back to the $1.33-$1.34
levels from where the euro broke down in December. Baring Asset
Management oversees $50 billion in assets.
 ""But the prevailing sentiment is that we test $1.20 and
maybe lower over the next few months,"" said Wilde. ""This
assumes that the (European) issues do not go away and that
countries like Portugal cannot fund indefinitely at 7 percent.""
""A failed auction, civil disobedience in defiance of
austerity measures or widening spreads in Spain and Italy, say,
could easily be the tipping point,"" Wilde said.

* Forex reserves lost 26 billion Sfr in value
 * SNB will fight deflation, inflation
 (Adds details, background)
 By Jason Rhodes
BERNE, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank suffered
its largest ever full-year loss in 2010 owing to currency losses
run up as it tried to stem the rise of the Swiss franc and
defended the interventions as necessary given deflation risks.
 In a release of preliminary full year results, the SNB said
it would post a full-year book loss of 21 billion Swiss francs
($21.82 billion) compared to a profit of 10 billion in 2009,
with currency reserve losses of 26 billion francs.
 The SNB has been widely criticised for running up the huge
losses on its holdings in its bid to stop the franc rising.
 SNB Chairman Philipp Hildebrand told a news conference the
losses would not change the central bank's policy as it sought
to maintain price stability.
 ""The national bank has a clear mandate. If necessary, we
will take the measures necessary to ensure price stability,""
Hildebrand said.
 The strength of the Swiss franc is having a considerable
effect on Switzerland's economic growth, SNB chief Phillip
Hildebrand said.
 ""We expect a marked weakening of growth in the coming year,
not least because of the franc's strength,"" Hildebrand said.
 The safe-haven franc rose about 16 percent against the euro
last year due to concerns about the euro zone debt crisis,
prompting the government to call a crisis meeting with business,
bank and trade union representatives on Friday.
 Participants agreed that the franc's strength presented
risks to the economy, but decided only the central bank could
act to combat the currency's strength.
 However, the SNB is not expected to resume currency
interventions due to its massive 2010 losses and as the risk
that the strong franc could trigger a harmful deflationary
spiral is lower now given the robust recovery.
 The SNB said on Friday it had decided to allocate just 0.7
billion francs to provisions for currency reserves for 2010
instead of 4 billion to enable it to stick to a planned payout
to the Swiss government and cantons and pay a dividend.
 However it said it might have to suspend the payout to the
government and cantons in future so it can build up reserves.
 ""The events of the past year have highlighted the fact that
an adequate capital cushion is paramount for monetary policy
independence,"" the SNB said in its statement.
 Gains on its gold reserves of just under 6 billion francs
helped to limit the loss, the SNB said, as did a fund of toxic
assets from UBS that the SNB acquired as part of the bailout of
Switzerland's largest bank in 2008.
 The central bank, which dropped its pledge to intervene in
June, recorded exchange-rate related losses of 21.2 billion
francs in the first nine months of the year.

 * Beijing could tamp down inflation with faster yuan rise
 * Washington tries new tack on currency ahead of Hu visit
(Recasts; adds background)
 WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner said on Friday there has been a ""substantial""
inflation-induced appreciation in China's yuan currency that
Beijing would do well to recognize and counter.
 ""Because Chinese inflation is accelerating more rapidly
than U.S inflation, the right measure of the pace of
appreciation is now more than 10 percent a year, and that is a
very substantial, material change,"" Geithner told reporters at
the White House.
 In a continuing bid by the Obama administration to persuade
China to let the yuan's nominal value rise more rapidly,
Geithner opened a new tack earlier this week by saying it would
be in China's own interest to do so in order to tamp down
inflation in its own economy.
 The so-called ""real"" exchange rate is adjusted to account
for the substantial difference between Chinese and U.S.
inflation -- 5 percent versus about 1 percent, respectively.
 Geithner told an audience on Tuesday that the current
""real"" pace of appreciation would help correct an exchange-rate
imbalance with the U.S. dollar but at an unnecessarily severe
cost to China. A stronger yuan in nominal terms could help cap
Chinese inflation, Geithner contends.
 Geithner spoke to reporters ahead of a Jan. 19 meeting at
the White House between Chinese President Hu Jintao and
President Barack Obama.
 In nominal terms, the yuan has risen about 3.6 percent
since China dropped a peg to the dollar in June, touching a
record high on Friday. [CNY/]
 ""The exchange rate has moved up a little over 3 percent ...
against the dollar since June of last year. That is an annual
rate of about 6 percent, maybe 7, 8 percent a year,"" Geithner
said. ""But that is not the best measure of competitiveness ...
(which) is the combined effect of that change and the
difference between China's inflation rate and ours.""
 Still, the pace of appreciation has not been enough to
please U.S. lawmakers, who argue China deliberately holds down
the value of the yuan to gain a trade advantage.
 The Treasury Department in October delayed a semi-annual
report on the exchange rate practices of major U.S. trading
partners, avoiding a decision on whether to label China a
currency manipulator.
 Treasury is expected to revisit the argument about the
difference between real and nominal exchange rates in that
report, now expected sometime after the Hu-Obama meeting, but
is not expected to pin a ""currency manipulator"" label on China
which could lead to trade actions.

 * US retail sales rise, but fall short of expectation
(Updates with U.S. midday trading)
 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - World stocks edged higher and
Wall Street rose on Friday as JP Morgan's strong earnings
offset weaker-than-expected U.S. retail sales, but China's move
to raise banks' reserves hit gold prices.
 And in a reminder of the persistent debt problems in the
euro zone, Fitch cut Greece's credit rating to junk on Friday.
The move, which followed similar downgrades by Standard &
Poor's and Moody's in December, highlighted doubts about the
country's ability to get itself out of a severe debt crisis
that has shaken the euro zone.
 A 47 percent jump in fourth-quarter profit at JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  soothed investors, even as much of the gain
came from dipping into money that the No. 2 U.S. bank had set
aside to cover bad loans. See [ID:nN14293086]
 ""We're optimistic that the earnings season starting is
actually going to be pretty positive,"" said Thomas Nyheim,
vice president and portfolio manager at Christiana Bank & Trust
Co in Greenville, Delaware.
 But U.S. gold futures fell more than 2 percent to a
one-week low on Friday -- tumbling $27.50 to $1,359.50 an ounce
-- as news that China's central bank raised lenders' reserve
requirements prompted a sharp sell-off. Spot gold <.XAU> slid
to $1,359.10, down from $1,372,75 late on Thursday.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices were flat to slightly higher,
with the 10-year note's yield steady at 3.30 percent,
representing an oasis of calm compared with the dramatic slide
in U.S. municipal bond prices.
 In the $2.8 trillion U.S. municipal bond market, the
sell-off continued for a fifth day, driving tax-free 30-year
bond yields up to 5.01 percent and reflecting investors'
nervousness about the shaky condition of state and local
finances throughout the United States.
 Christopher Ryon, a portfolio manager with Thornburg
Investment Management, which oversees $75 billion in assets,
said there are anecdotal reports of crossover buyers stepping
into the market. ""That sometimes indicates a market bottom,""
he said. For more details, please click on [ID:nN14153675]
Earlier in the day, confidence in equity markets also sagged
as the U.S. Commerce Department reported sales at retailers
rose slightly less than expected in December. Sales for all of
2010 reversed two years of contraction, however, posting the
biggest gain in more than a decade. [ID:nN1350517]
 ""The market is resilient,"" said Keith Springer, president
of Springer Financial Advisors in Sacremento, California.
 ""You had had every ingredient to bring a decline, such as
retail sales, yet it's holding up well,"" he said. ""There is
anticipation over more stellar earnings.""
 A soggy start to U.S. trading and in Europe came after
China's 50-basis-point increase in required reserves forced its
banks to lock up more of their cash with the central bank as
Beijing hopes to drain the economy of excess money and tame
rising prices. [ID:nTOE706030]
 The tightening briefly hit copper prices, and speculation
about such a move earlier sent Chinese stocks <.SSEC> down 1.29
percent. Coming off a 28-month high on Thursday, the MSCI
All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS> edged up 0.04 percent,
 At midday in New York, the three major U.S. stock indexes
rose modestly, reversing earlier declines. The Dow Jones
industrial average <.DJI> rose 29.63 points, or 0.25 percent,
to 11,761.53 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> gained
4.92 points, or 0.38 percent, to 1,288.68.
 The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 8,94
points, or 0.33 percent, at 2,744.23, drawing some support a
day after Intel  posted better-than-expected quarterly
earnings. The semiconductor index <.SOX> shot up 2 percent.
 The S&P MidCap 400 Index <.MID> hit an intraday record high
of 928.92 in midday trading, reflecting expectations for solid
U.S. growth.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> dropped 0.1
percent, recovering some lossses as commodities, such as copper
and oil bounced off earlier lows. Oil fell 27 cents, or 0.30
percent, to $91.15 per barrel.
 Japan's Nikkei average <.N225> fell 0.86 percent after a
surprisingly weak settlement of options for January and a
stronger yen against the dollar trigger profit-taking.
 The euro drew earlier support on Friday after a string of
successful debt auctions by struggling euro-zone nations calmed
fears of the region's credit crisis. A Fitch Ratings downgrade
of Greece's credit, noting a heavy debt burden is making the
nation vulnerable to adverse shocks, offset euro strength.
 The Australian dollar fell after China raised banks'
reserve requirements and fostered speculation of cooler Chinese
growth. Australia's strong trade links with China make it
sensitive to Chinese growth expectations. See [ID:nTOE706030]
 The euro -- on track for its biggest weekly gain since May
2009 -- also rose this week after European Central Bank chief
Jean-Claude Trichet's warning on inflation raised expectations
of rising interest rates. [ID:nLDE70C1WK]
 By midday, the dollar had erased losses against both the
euro and the yen as Fitch downgraded Greece, and as some
traders squared positions ahead of a three-day weekend in the
United States. The euro  dipped 0.01 percent to $1.3353.
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  gained 0.13 percent
to 82.91 yen.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices had rise after the retail sales
data, and also as higher gasoline prices pushed overall
December consumer prices up at their fastest pace in a year and
a half, which also weighed on consumer sentiment in early
January, according to a Reuters/University of Michigan survey.
[ID:nN14146780] [ID:nN14150837]
 But by midday, Treasury debt prices were almost flat.
 Driving prices at the pump, U.S. oil prices  have
soared more than 62 percent since early 2009. The S&P energy
index <.GSPE> has been rising for eight months and is close to
its highest since October 2008.
 Within the U.S., however, shaky government finances are
hitting confidence of investors who have been yanking money
from the tax-exempt market.
 Earlier, Treasuries also had gained, reflecting perceptions
that the national economic reports are unlikely to budge the
Federal Reserve from its $600 billion U.S. bond buying program
aimed at accelerating growth and lowering the lofty jobless
rate, analysts said.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The euro headed for its best
week in more than 1-1/2 years on Friday and could extend gains
after a string of successful securities auctions by indebted
euro zone nations calmed fears of the region's credit crisis.
 The euro earlier hit just above $1.3450, edging closer to
key resistance at $1.35, its December high. Analysts said the
euro's recovery could continue in the near term, though gains
above $1.35 could be difficult given nervousness over the large
amount of debt supply from weaker euro zone economies in 2011.
 Debt auctions by Portugal, Spain and Italy all saw strong
demand this week, which temporarily eased worries about these
countries ability to fund their debt. Gains in the euro were
also fueled by comments from European Central Bank chief
Jean-Claude Trichet, whose warning on inflation raised
expectations of rising interest rates.
 ""The extreme of bearishness is being unwound, but I don't
think we are on the verge of a new round of euro bullishness,""
said David Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital
Markets in Toronto.
 ""We still don't have long-term solutions and it really
doesn't look like EU policymakers are going to come up with any
long-term solutions,"" he added. ""Interest rates in general in
the EU periphery are too high and the growth outlook is still
relatively weak.""
 In midday New York trading, the euro was down 0.2 percent
at $1.3328, after having earlier hit a high of $1.3458 on
trading platform EBS and crossing above its 100-day moving
average at $1.3410.
 On the week, the euro was on track for a weekly gain of
about 3.5 percent, the biggest since May, 2009.
 Technical analysts also highlighted a bearish signal after
the 55-day euro/dollar moving average crossed below the 100-day
moving average on Thursday.
 Karen Anne Jones, technical analyst at Commerzbank, expects
the $1.35 level for euro/dollar to hold. ""Our favored scenario
is for failure ahead of 1.3500 and a slide back to 1.2795, the
61.8 percent retracement of the move seen in the second half of
2010,"" she said in a note.
 LESS BEARISHNESS
 The options market is showing less bearish sentiment on the
euro against the dollar.
 On Friday, one-month euro/dollar risk reversals, a gauge of
market sentiment, traded at -1.25, still with a bias toward
euro puts, suggesting more investors are betting the euro will
fall than rise. That was up from -1.88 on Monday.
 The euro was down 0.1 percent at 1.2861 Swiss francs, off
an earlier one-month high of 1.2953. Moves to counter Swiss
franc strength should be left to the central bank despite the
risks posed to the Swiss economy, a crisis meeting of
government, business, bank and trade union representatives
agreed on Friday.
 The Australian dollar fell 0.8 percent to US$0.9882 after
China raised banks' reserve requirements by 50 basis points,
stoking fears of a slowdown in the Chinese economy. Australia's
strong trade links with China make it sensitive to Chinese
growth expectations.
 The euro was flat at 1.2874 Swiss francs, off an earlier
one-month high of 1.2953. Moves to counter Swiss franc strength
should be left to the central bank despite the risks posed to
the Swiss economy, a crisis meeting of government, business,
bank and trade union representatives agreed on Friday.
 The dollar slipped 0.1 percent to 82.75 yen. U.S. data on
Friday showed a smaller-than-expected retail sales gain and a
fall in consumer sentiment. See
 ""The data reminds people the Fed won't be ending its easing
program or raising rates any time soon, while the ECB yesterday
was talking about inflation. That makes the dollar look really
attractive as a funding currency,"" said Kathy Lien, director of
currency research at GFT in New York.

 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Chinese President Hu Jintao
will bring new business deals and possible commitments to buy
U.S. beef and software when he visits Washington next week, a
U.S. business group said on Friday.
 ""He will come with gifts,"" Myron Brilliant, senior vice
president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told reporters ahead
of the formal state visit. ""There are many companies that will
be signing contracts.""
 China has a pattern of tying business deals to high-level
visits to try to generate political goodwill.
 Brilliant declined to comment on the commercial value of
contracts to be signed next week but said the ceremony would
take place at the White House.
 Other industry officials also hesitated to estimate the
dollar value of the contracts.
 ""It's very fluid. I don't think even the Chinese know,"" one
industry aide said.
 Hu and U.S. President Barack Obama are expected to drop by
a meeting between 15 American and five Chinese chief executives
at the White House on Wednesday.
 The U.S. side is likely to include senior officials from
Coca-Cola, General Electric, Microsoft, Boeing and Dow
Chemical.
 Another set of U.S.-China business deals are expected to be
signed later in the week in Chicago, which Hu will visit on the
second leg of his visit.
 ""THE RIGHT KIND OF POLICIES""
 Brilliant said the U.S. business community appreciates such
gestures but also wants Hu and Obama to lay out a clear vision
of how the world's two largest economies will manage commercial
ties in coming decades.
 ""We are obviously concerned about the impact of China's
state-led development and the use of industrial and regulatory
policies that hinder opportunities for our companies and impose
greater threats in terms of future opportunities,"" he said.
 In a sign of the important role economic issues will play
in next week's visit, Hu's one public speech will be at a lunch
on Thursday co-hosted by the U.S.-China Business Council.
 Last month, Chinese officials pledged during high-level
talks in Washington to address U.S. trade concerns in areas
ranging from import restrictions on U.S. beef to promoting the
increased use of legal software by Chinese government agencies
and state-owned enterprises.
 ""I am hopeful President Hu Jintao's visit will cement these
commitments,"" Brilliant said, noting several U.S. officials
have been in China over the past 10 days for follow-up talks.
 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also wants to hear a clear
statement that China is determined to shift from an export-led
growth strategy to one that relies more on increasing domestic
consumption, he said.
 ""We also have to listen to the Chinese when it comes to
wanting to invest in our country. We should encourage that. It
creates jobs in our market,"" Brilliant said.
 At the same time, he said, ""it's fair for us to press the
Chinese to adopt the right kind of policies that will keep
their market open to our goods and services.""

 NEW YORK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - World shares wobbled and
Treasuries rose on Friday after China's move to raise banks'
reserves and a weaker-than-expected U.S. retail sales report
cooled enthusiasm about the global economic recovery.
 A 47 percent jump in fourth-quarter profit at JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  soothed some investors though much of the
gain came from dipping into money that the No. 2 U.S. bank had
set aside to cover bad loans. See [ID:nN14293086]
 Confidence in equity markets also sagged as the U.S.
Commerce Department reported sales at retailers rose slightly
less than expected in December. Sales for all of 2010 reversed
two years of contraction, however, posting the biggest gain in
more than a decade. [ID:nN1350517]
 ""The market is resilient,"" said Keith Springer, president
of Springer Financial Advisors in Sacremento, California.
 ""You had had every ingredient to bring a decline, such as
retail sales, yet it's holding up well,"" he said. ""There is
anticipation over more stellar earnings.""
 A soggy start to U.S. trading and in Europe came after
China's 50-basis-point increase in required reserves forced its
banks to lock up more of their cash with the central bank as
Beijing hopes to drain the economy of excess money and tame
rising prices. [ID:nTOE706030]
 The tightening briefly hit copper prices, and speculation
about such a move earlier sent Chinese stocks <.SSEC> down 1.29
percent. Coming off a 28-month high on Thursday, the MSCI
All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS> dipped 0.03 percent,

expectations of rising interest rates. [ID:nLDE70C1WK]
 In late morning, though, the dollar had erased its losses
against both the euro and the yen, which some traders
attributed to position squaring ahead of a three-day weekend in

 By Samantha Pearson and Nathalia Ferreira
 SAO PAULO, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The Brazilian real sank on
Friday after the central bank introduced another aggressive
measure to curb its currency, while the Chilean peso dipped
following the country's interest rate decision.
 Like many emerging economies across Latin America and Asia,
Brazil and Chile have struggled with currency appreciation that
has made their exports more difficult to sell abroad and
flooded the countries with cheap imports.
 The Brazilian real  was trading 0.77 percent weaker
at 1.680 reais per U.S. dollar on the local spot market after
the central bank intervened in the futures market for the first
time since 2009.
 The Chilean peso  dipped 0.1 percent to 490.20 per
dollar after the country held its benchmark interest rate
steady at 3.25 percent, pausing after seven straight increases
to help relieve pressure on its currency. For more, see:[ID:nN13283103]
 Brazil's central bank called an auction on Friday of
reverse currency swaps -- a form of derivative that has the
same effect as buying dollars on the futures market.
[ID:nN13136301]
 It sold all 20,000 contracts on offer, worth $988 million,
in its first such auction since May 2009. [ID:nN14137379]
 Such strong demand suggests the central bank may return to
calling reverse swap auctions on a regular basis as it has done
in the past, said Flavio Serrano, senior Brazil economist at
Espirito Santo Investment Bank in Sao Paulo.
 However, he said the effect on the exchange rate may be
limited.
 ""It is putting some pressure on the currency but it won't
really change the long-term trend,"" he said. ""It should
continue to move between 1.67 and 1.72.""
 China's decision to hike banks' reserve requirements, which
knocked down the price of many of the region's key commodity
exports on Friday, also weighed on the currencies in the early
session. But positive U.S. economic data gave support later in
the day, helping the Chilean peso to pare most of its sharp
early losses. [ID:nLDE70D0SV]
 JUGGLING INFLATION AND CURRENCIES
 Brazil's latest move could help clear the way for the
central bank to raise interest rates by 50 basis points at its
meeting next week.
 Countries such as Brazil and Chile face a tough dilemma. On
one hand, they need to raise interest rates to control rising
inflation. But by doing so, they risk worsening their currency
problems.
 Latin America's relatively high interest rates have
attracted a flood of hot money over recent months, pushing the
Brazilian real to a 2-year high and the Chilean peso to its
strongest in almost 3 years.
 Yields on Brazilian interest rate futures contracts
<0#DIJ:> rose on Friday as investors bet on a bigger interest
rate hike next week.
 Elsewhere in the region, Mexico's currency tracked global
markets. The peso  reversed early losses to firm 0.1
percent to 12.1150 per dollar after surprisingly strong U.S.
industrial output in December backed bets that Mexico's closely
linked factories will also post stronger-than-expected growth.
 Currency intervention in other countries is also making
Mexico's free-floating peso more attractive. Local authorities
are not expected to introduce similar measures to those in
Brazil and Chile because the currency has yet to recover to
levels seen before the 2008 financial crisis.

 By Paul Eckert
 WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S.-China relations are at
a critical juncture and a summit between their leaders next
week must produce ""real action, on real issues"" such as trade,
climate change and North Korean nuclear proliferation, U.S.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Friday.
 ""It is up to both nations to translate the high-level
pledges of summits and state visits into action. Real action,
on real issues,"" she said in a major China policy address.
 Clinton urged China to let its currency appreciate faster,
end discrimination against foreign companies and further open
its markets to U.S. manufactured goods and farm products.
 Some U.S. analysts see Chinese President Hu Jintao's trip
as the most important state visit in 30 years. The leaders of
the world's two biggest economies are trying to put behind them
a stormy 2010 and forge more stable ties for the coming years.
 Washington and Beijing sparred last year over longstanding
issues such as U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, the status of Tibet's
Dalai Lama and human rights. They also quarreled over newer
problems including deadly North Korean attacks on South Korea,
South China Sea navigation rights, and rare earth minerals.
 Clinton's remarks were part of a week of China policy
speeches by U.S. Cabinet officials -- and a trip to Beijing by
Defense Secretary Robert Gates -- designed to set the tone for
President Barack Obama's Jan. 19 Washington summit with Hu.
 U.S. DEMANDS ON PARADE
 Each Obama administration official stressed the value of
the China relationship to the United States, but also drove
home demands for currency appreciation and other U.S. economic
goals as well as help with global trouble spots.
 Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Friday noted that
the yuan had gained in real, inflation-adjusted terms.
 ""Because Chinese inflation is accelerating more rapidly
than U.S. inflation, the right measure of the pace of
appreciation is now more than 10 percent a year, and that is a
very substantial, material change,"" he said.
 On global problems, the United States wants China to ""step
up to more of its obligations,"" Clinton said.
 ""Global recession, nuclear proliferation, terrorism, piracy
on the high seas -- these are threats that affect us all,"" she
said. ""China should join us in confronting them.""
 China and the United States, the world's two largest
emitters of greenhouse gases, had worked to forge the Cancun
Agreement on climate change but now must implement the pact on
transparency, funding, and clean energy technology, she said.
 China analyst Dean Cheng of the Heritage Foundation in
Washington said appeals to mutual interest are a tough sell to
China, which is ""not in the habit of granting favors.""
 ""The United States can make all the demands it wishes, but
China will satisfy those demands only if the Chinese action is
consistent with China's interest, or the United States somehow
can demonstrate that it can be in China's interest,"" he said.
 Hu, who hands power to a successor in 2012, is coming to
Washington with more general goals for the summit, said Bonnie
Glaser of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
 ""The Chinese are looking mostly for symbols, optics, face,""
she said.
 SEEKING HELP WITH NORTH KOREA
 On North Korea, Washington has held out the prospect of
resuming long-dormant six-party talks involving the two Koreas,
the United States, China, Japan and Russia to curb Pyongyang's
nuclear arms programs if Pyongyang ceases attacks that killed
50 South Koreans in 2010 and commits to denuclearization.
 ""It is vital that China join with us in sending North Korea
an unequivocal signal that its recent provocations -- including
the announced uranium enrichment program -- are unacceptable
and in violation of Security Council resolutions,"" said
Clinton, urging Beijing to uphold U.N. sanctions on Pyongyang.
 U.S. and Chinese companies will sign a number of business
deals when Hu visits Washington, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
said on Friday.
 Myron Brilliant, a chamber senior vice president, said he
was also hopeful Hu's visit would flesh out recent commitments
to reopen its market to U.S. beef and to fight copyright piracy
by increasing the government's use of legal software.
 Obama, who won the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize, is in an awkward
position as host to the head of a state that has jailed the
2010 laureate, dissident Liu Xiaobo, say activists who have
criticized what they see as a muted U.S. approach on China.
 ""We reiterate our call for the release of Liu Xiaobo and
the many other political prisoners in China, including those
under house arrest and those enduring enforced disappearances,""
Clinton said in remarks that encouraged the rights community.
 ""While we had hoped Secretary Clinton would publicly say
what everyone knows -- that the human rights situation in China
is not only poor, but worsening -- we welcomed her citation of
specific examples of China's failure to respect human rights,""
said Human Rights First President Elisa Massimino.
 Clinton urged people in both countries to put aside
zero-sum thinking about great power rivalries.
 ""A thriving America is good for China and a thriving China
is good for America,"" she said.

305,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2011 11:04AM ET</span>",Iceland needs caution on ending FX controls - IMF," STOCKHOLM, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Iceland is recovering from the
crisis caused by the collapse of its banks, but risks remain and
the country should be cautious about ending capital controls,
the International Monetary Fund said on Friday.
 In a report after the Fund on Monday approved more funds for
the North Atlantic island, IMF staff said the government
intended to prepare a revised strategy for ending the capital
controls for adoption by the cabinet by the end of February.
 ""The Icelandic economy is gradually recovering...Still,
there are still significant risks to the recovery,"" the IMF
staff said.
 The IMF said it had revised down its forecast for gross
domestic product growth this year to 2 percent from 3 percent
due to a delayed investment project.
 Iceland slapped on capital controls in late 2008 to stop
foreign investors pulling funds out and causing the crown to
crash. It wants to ease the controls, but the IMF said that it
and the authorities agreed the changes should be implemented
cautiously.
 ""Staff are concerned that the liberalization of controls may
proceed too rapidly, before the financial sector is sufficiently
robust and additional sources of budgetary financing are
secured,"" the report said.
 The government said in its letter of intent, included in the
IMF report, that the planned strategy for lifting controls would
clarify how Iceland will judge whether various conditions for
ending the restrictions had been met.
 These would include the sustainability of government debt
and confidence in being able to access international markets.
 It would also include the availability of sufficient
investment opportunities in Iceland, including the revival of
domestic capital markets.
 The IMF also said slow progress in restructuring corporate
and household debt continued to hinder the recovery.
 ""Further delays in investment projects and shocks to
external demand and commodity prices could also slow growth,
while higher-than-expected wage increases could push inflation
higher,"" it added.
 Credit could also be constrained for some time as the
country's battered banks keep repairing their balance sheet, it
said.

business, bank and trade union representatives agreed on Friday.
 The safe-haven franc rose about 16 percent against the euro
last year due to concerns about the euro zone debt crisis,
making exports more expensive and prompting warnings from the
Swiss National Bank it could threaten the economic recovery.
 Participants at the meeting agreed that the franc's high
valuation against the euro and the dollar presented risks to the
economy, but decided only the central bank could act to combat
the currency's strength, the Swiss Economics Ministry said.
 ""There was unanimous agreement that the strength of the
franc can only be tackled by monetary policy, for which the
Swiss National Bank is responsible,"" the ministry said in a
statement.
 ""Various participants underscored the major importance of
the national bank's independence in this respect.""
 On Wednesday, SNB vice-chairman Thomas Jordan said the
strong franc was an enormous challenge for exporters, but
dismissed calls for measures to fight its rise such as negative
interest rates or a euro-franc peg.
 The SNB is also not expected to resume the currency
interventions it stopped in June after it was widely criticised
for running up massive losses, especially as the risk the franc
will trigger a harmful deflation spiral is seen as low given the
robust recovery.
 
 STRONG FRANC HITS JOBS, EXPORTERS
 While a number of those present at the meeting proposed
measures to stop the franc's rise, opinions varied on the
possible effect such measures might have, the government added.
 The Swiss Federation of Trade Unions, which has backed the
idea of tying the franc to the euro, urged the government to
take action on the currency in order to protect Swiss jobs.
 ""The good thing about today's franc summit was that it took
place at all. People are becoming more conscious of the fact
that the strengthening franc is a huge problem for Switzerland's
workplace,"" the federation said on its website.
 Meanwhile, the Swiss Banking Association rejected
accusations that its members had contributed to the currency
crisis by speculating, saying Swiss banks only contributed about
5 percent to global currency trade.
 ""This is not about franc strength, but about euro and dollar
weakness founded on a massive loss of confidence of
international investors,"" its head of communication Jean-Marc
Felix said in a statement.
 The franc's strength is hitting the country's financial
industry and the wider economy as well as exporters, the Swiss
Private Bankers Association said on Thursday. [ID:nLDE7091OP]
 Friday's meeting was called after the franc hit record highs
at the end of December, but it has actually fallen sharply this
week on improved euro zone sentiment, leaving it some 4 percent
off the all-time high of 1.24 per euro it hit on Dec. 30. 
 It was trading at 1.288 francs per euro at 1545 GMT.
 However, the franc's strength has already hurt earnings at
Swiss companies, with sanitary equipment maker Geberit 
on Thursday just the latest to report an impact from the
currency on fourth-quarter sales.
 Swiss Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey said at a
separate event in Geneva that the government would consider
measures to counteract the strength of the franc if pressed.
 ""If necessary the Federal Council would take measures if the
time came,"" Calmy-Rey told the Swiss Press Club in Geneva.

313,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2011 09:52AM ET</span>",PREVIEW-Saudi leaders to discuss plans for food reserves," By Ulf Laessing 
 RIYADH, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian leaders in
government and industry are set on Sunday to discuss plans to
increase strategic food reserves to fend off a spike in global
prices and secure food supplies.
 The top OPEC oil exporter, which suffered like other Gulf
Arab states in 2008 when international food prices rose, said
this week it would boost wheat reserves to cover its needs for a
year instead of six months following a call by its
quasi-parliament, the Shura Council.
 Executives and officials at the chamber of commerce said
Saudi Arabia needed to build reserves in foods such as wheat and
eight other commodities as a buffer against rising global
prices.
 Top government officials will address the issue on Sunday at
a conference hosted by the food security committee of the Riyadh
chamber of commerce. The head of the grains authority as well as
trade and agricultural ministers will attend, according to the
invitation.
 The United Nations' food agency (FAO) said earlier this
month that food prices had hit a record high last month above
2008 levels.
 Saudi Arabia's annual inflation eased in December to 5.4
percent -- well below record the record of 11.1 percent in July
2008 -- but rising global prices will keep inflation above
average historic levels, economists say.
 ""Food inflation in Saudi could remain in the high single
digits,"" said Banque Saudi Fransi chief economist John
Sfakianakis.
 The kingdom has become a major buyer of wheat and other
commodities to cover food needs as the population grows, the
economy attracts more expatriates and it piles up reserves.
Saudi Arabia's current wheat reserves stand at 1.4 million
tonnes plus a supply of 700,000 tonnes by April, the grains
authority said this week.
 ""Food reserves could provide some short-term solutions, but
long-term ones will be provided when there is progress with
farmland investment plans abroad,"" said Sfakianakis.
 Apart from building up reserves, Saudi Arabia has been
trying to secure farmland in Africa. It ended its wheat
cultivation programme three years ago due to dwindling water
resources. 
 The government has urged companies to invest in farm
projects abroad, but diplomats say progress has been slow over
ownership rights to farmland.

 LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - An improving global economy,
solid corporate earnings and even easing fears about euro zone
debt have been more than enough to rationalise the rising hunger
for riskier assets now prevalent on financial markets.
 Investors, however, are about to get a reality check.
 The coming week features a dollop of economic data from the
United States and China, a heating up of the fourth-quarter
earnings season, and a meeting of European Union finance
ministers to beef up their debt bailout provisions.
 Equity markets come into this at multi-year highs, with the
MSCI all-country world index at levels last seen in September
2008.
 Corporate earnings are robust. Intel Corp, for one, had a
rosy outlook for early 2011. Mega U.S. bank JPMorgan also had
better-than-expected earnings and saw stability and growth
returning to global capital markets to boot.
 U.S. and Chinese economic data, meanwhile, have been strong
enough to prompt banks such as Morgan Stanley to forecast a 2011
global growth rate above the long-term average, in this case 4.2
percent against around 3.5 percent.
 Reality check one should be the EU finance ministers
meeting. It follows a series of relatively successful bond
auctions in Portugal, Spain and Italy that eased some concern
about the ability of debt-strapped peripheral euro zone
economies to finance themselves.
 Any sign of a consensus at the EU meeting on expanding the
European Financial Stability Facility and/or firm proposals to
buy back peripheral sovereign debt from secondary markets should
add another stabilising effect.
 But the impact of the crisis itself is getting harder to
gauge because the appetite for stocks and other higher-yielding
assets among investors has translated into most sovereign bonds
in developed markets falling out of favour.
 This means that any rise in peripheral debt yields is not
necessarily tied to fears of default in Greece, Ireland,
Portugal and so on. It might just be linked to moves into
riskier assets and away from bonds in general.
 Such a phenomenon can already be seen by comparing not just
the spreads between peripheral bond yields and the German Bund
yield -- which have narrowed in January -- but by the direction
both have been moving.
 ""In earlier days (of the crisis), when spreads widened, we
saw a substantial decline in German yields. Everybody started to
buy Bunds,"" said Kommer van Tright, a bond manager at Dutch fund
firm Robeco.
 ""Towards the end of last year and this year as well,
peripheral trouble does not translate in to a demand for Bunds.""
 Some idea of the current demand for German debt will come on
Wednesday with an auction of two-year bonds.
 
 DATA DUMP
 Reality check two is global growth.
 The big driver behind the past few month's growing risk
appetite has been increasing evidence that the global economy is
doing nicely, including in the United States and China.
 U.S. recovery has been strong enough to persuade investors
that a double dip recession is off the cards, but it still has
deep problems.
 The division should be on display in the coming week with
manufacturing reports and leading indicators likely to show
gathering strength, but housing data reminding investors of the
deeply embedded weaknesses in the economy.
 China releases its latest growth, production and inflation
numbers -- all playing on one of the biggest global risks of the
year, namely overaggressive Chinese monetary tightening.
 ING summed up split prospects in a 2011 outlook for
financial markets:
 ""We start the year in a better position than at any time in
recent years, and our base case is that economic growth will
continue to firm without leading to a pick up in inflation, and
that financial markets will continue to normalise. But the list
of things that could go wrong is a long one.""
 One of those is a ""currency war"" between China and the
United States, which is railing against what it sees as an
artificially low yuan exchange rate.
 A summit in the coming week between U.S. President Barak
Obama and his Chinese counterpart, Hu Jintao, should thus keep
forex markets at the least on edge.
 The yuan, however, did hit a record high on Friday ahead of
the Hu's visit to Washington and China raised bank's reserve
requirements by 50 basis points.
 
 EARNINGS TO COME
 Reality check three is whether companies really are in as
good a shape as early quarterly reports suggest. Equity
investors have been buoyed by the earnings season, which has
seen some solid upside surprises.
 But it is only really just getting off the ground.
 The coming week sees a speed up in U.S. reporting and the
first big flush of European company statements.
 Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Citigroup,
General Electric, Wells Fargo, Google, Ahold and Delhaize are
among them.
 Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research estimated that the
earnings of the companies of the S&P 500 index will rise on
average 31.8 percent for the quarter.
 Surprises on top of that will just make investors even more
comfortable with risk.

318,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2011 08:52AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Sweden's economy set for second chart-topping year," * Sweden likely best performer in Europe 2010 and 2011
 * Growth to slow slightly but remain strong
 * Crown seen strengthening further on more rate hikes
 * Deeper euro debt crisis could tarnish rosy picture
 
 By Simon Johnson
 STOCKHOLM, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Buoyant domestic demand and a
durable pipeline of industrial exports to developing nations
will likely help Sweden repeat its performance as western
Europe's fastest-growing economy for the second year running in
2011.
 The Nordic country recorded its speediest expansion for 40
years in 2010, and while that achievement can in part be put
down to the depth of its slump in 2009, its economy has been in
a sweet spot.
 China, India and Brazil, which are investing heavily in
modernising their infrastructure, are driving the global
recovery and Swedish industry, which is heavily skewed toward
the production of plant and machinery, is reaping the benefit.
 If the country's central bank is right, economic output
expanded 5.5 per cent in 2010 and will grow another 4.4 per cent
in 2011.
 All of that, analysts say, adds to the allure of Swedish
assets.
 Predicted further interest rate hikes will support the
Swedish crown -- recently trading near 10-year highs against the
euro -- and analysts forecast more gains on the country's stock
market as its top exporters continue to flourish.
 ""Sweden is Europe's top performer and the economy is
certainly going to outperform again this year,"" said Tina
Mortensen, economist at Citigroup Global Markets.
 Citibank reckons the economy will expand 5 percent this year
and 3.4 percent in 2012, and ""the risks are definitely on the
upside (for 2012),"" Mortensen said.
 ""In the early stages of development, big infrastructure
projects and IT investment, Sweden has a lot to offer,"" said
Mauro Gozzo, chief economist at the Swedish Trade Council.
 Domestic demand has also been strong.
 Sound public finances gave Sweden the ammunition to
stimulate the economy more than most during the downturn. Such
measures amounted to around 2.8 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP) over 2009 and 2010.
 The banking system also remained sound. Swedbank, SEB were
bruised by recession in the Baltics, but none of Sweden's major
lenders had to be bailed out by the government.
 Swedish households mainly have floating rate mortgages,
meaning they benefited more quickly than households in other
European countries when interest rates were slashed in 2008.
House prices have continued to rise.
 
 NO NEED FOR AUSTERITY
 The pro-Sweden factors show no sign of going away.
 China may be looking to cool its economy -- it raised rates
in December and on Friday hiked bank reserve requirements for
the fourth time in just over two months -- and growth could dip
in other emerging markets, but the overall outlook remains
strong.
 The OECD forecasts world GDP growth of 4.2 percent in 2011
and 4.6 percent the year after, and trade growth will remain
solid.
 ""Over the next 10 years, we think the prospects are very
good for Asia, Brazil, a couple of other Latin American
countries and a couple in the Middle East,"" Gozzo at the Swedish
Trade Council said.
 Nor has Sweden any need to impose the spending cuts that
will sap demand across much of the rest of Europe.
 In fact, after introducing tax breaks for pensioners this
year, a fifth round of income tax cuts is expected in 2012 as
government finances return to surplus.
 Unemployment rose sharply during the crisis but has come
down faster than expected, standing at 7.1 percent in November.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
 
 WORRIES OVER CROWN
 There are risks, notably from the strength of the crown and
the potential for Europe's debt crisis to weigh more broadly.
 The economic recovery and rate hikes have pushed the Swedish
currency up steadily against euro.
 Analysts see further gains, though after its stellar
performance of the last two years these may be muted and could
also be offset by an earlier than expected European Central Bank
rate hike after its President, Jean-Claude Trichet, warned on
Thursday of short-term inflationary pressures.
 A higher crown over the longer term would eat into
exporters' profits, which for the likes of compressor firm Atlas
Copco and bearing maker SKF are at record levels.
 Danske Markets senior analyst Kasper Kirkegaard said he saw
the crown at 8.70 per euro in a year's time.
 ""As the fundamentals are improving ... we do see the
potential for more appreciation than that,"" he said.
 Banking group SEB sees fair value for the crown at
around 8.27 to the euro. That compares with 8.97 on Friday.
 Stockholm's blue chip index has beaten the broad European
benchmark for the last two years, rising 23 percent and 46
percent respectively, but returns ahead are likely to be more
modest, analysts say.
 Further rate hikes would tend to make consumers more
cautious and Europe's debt crisis could also cloud the rosy
picture.
 ""The situation in Europe is the biggest worry,"" said SEB's
Holmgren. ""A double dip there would definitely be felt in
Swedish exports and if there are continued problems, you would
probably have financial stress that spills over into Sweden.""

 * Airbus seen beating Boeing on net and gross orders
 * Airbus approaches milestone of 10,000th plane order
 
 By Tim Hepher
 PARIS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Airbus looks set to leapfrog
Boeing and score a surprise last-minute win on orders when it
unveils 2010 commercial results next week, industry sources said
on Friday.
The world's two leading jet makers are riding a crest of new
orders as air travel bounces back from recession and oil prices
near $100 a barrel accelerate a shift to economic new models.
 Analysis of a pipeline of preliminary orders waiting to be
signed suggests Airbus has the potential to close a significant
gap and beat its U.S. arch-rival for the third year running,
following a ritual dash to the finishing line.
As numbers were fine-tuned, there was mounting confidence in
the European camp on Friday that the EADS subsidiary would find
enough commitments and potentially add more in time to trumpet
success at an annual news conference on Monday.
 ""Airbus should beat Boeing in both net and gross orders,"" a
European industry source said, asking not to be named. Net
orders are adjusted for cancellations.
 A second industry source said Airbus was confident on orders
after lagging behind Boeing for much of the past year and that
Monday's figures would demonstrate ""the crisis is behind us"".
 Neither source was prepared to be named because they are not
authorised to talk about the matter. Airbus declined comment.
 EADS chief executive Louis Gallois, said on Wednesday Airbus
sold and delivered more than 500 planes in 2010 but did not say
how well it fared against Boeing, which reported 530 net orders.
 Stealing the show would be an unexpected win for Airbus as
it fast approaches the 10,000th order in its 40-year history.
 This week it surprised the industry by announcing the
world's biggest potential order by volume with a preliminary
180-plane sale to India's IndiGo, boosting EADS shares.
 However, Monday's press conference will also be overshadowed
by wrinkles in A380 output following the Qantas jet emergency,
demanding schedules for keeping A350 development on track and
concerns over the pace at which demand translates into profit.
 ""It matters less whether Airbus or Boeing won a single year
than whether they are doing it right, producing a better bottom
line and giving the customer what they want and avoiding
delays,"" said senior BGC Partners strategist Howard Wheeldon.
 Gallois this week called EADS's targeted 1.1 billion euro
2010 operating profit and a flat 2011 outlook ""unsatisfactory"".
. Airbus provides two thirds of EADS income.
 
 APPROACHING 10,000
 Airbus and Boeing are recovering from an industry recession
which saw combined demand for their planes fall by more than two
thirds in 2009 as passenger and cargo traffic plummeted.However
there were still dozens of plane cancellations in 2010.
 Delta Air Lines said on Thursday it had opened a contest for
200 jets to replace ageing ones.
 By the end of November Airbus had notched up 440 orders,
leaving a gap of 185 to catch up with Boeing's full-year total
of 625. After cancellations, Airbus had 388 net orders in the
first 11 months, 142 behind Boeing's full-year total of 530.
 Since the end of November, Airbus has narrowed the gap by
announcing 73 orders for A320 jets -- 8 from Irish lessor
Avolon, 50 from Chile's LAN, confirming a provisional deal, and
15 from easyJet announced shortly after the new year yet likely
to be included in the 2010 total.
 Overhauling Boeing may depend on Airbus's ability to close
other deals left pending since the 2010 Farnborough air show,
notably an order for at least 40 planes from Virgin America as
well as 15 mid-sized A350s earmarked for Hong Kong Airlines.
 China signed up for 66 extra planes when President Hu Jintao
visited Paris in November, but the status of the deal was left
vague, nor did the parties say when it would be finalized. 
 Airbus delivered more planes than Boeing for the eighth year
running in 2010. Boeing reported 462 deliveries for the full
year compared with Airbus's 461 by end-Nov.
 Airbus was founded in 1970 initially as a consortium between
France, Germany and Britain which were later joined by Spain.
 By end-Nov, Airbus had sold a total of 9,874 planes in its
history, with industry bosses trying to guess which of their
rivals will place the 10,000th order and bathe in the publicity
which the airline industry usually lays on for such events.
 Boeing has sold 20,663 commercial planes since January 1958,
the first month for which records are available on its website.
 Both planemakers have thousands of planes on order.
 The U.S. firm says Airbus was only able to succeed because
of unfair European government subsidies, a charge EADS denies. 
 Both sides are airing mutual subsidy claims at the World
Trade Organization with milestones in both cases expected soon.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The euro fell back from one-month
highs against the dollar and the Australian dollar dipped on
Friday after China raised banks' reserve requirements by a
further 50 basis points.
 China's tightening move [ID:nTOE706030], the fourth increase
in reserve requirements in just over two months, offered further
evidence the central bank is preparing to allow economic growth
to slow as it battles inflation. That prompted investors to pare
back risk exposure, hitting equity markets and perceived
higher-risk currencies.
 The Aussie was worst hit, given Australia's close trade
links to China, but the euro also slipped back into negative
territory on the day against the dollar, reversing an earlier
surge that some felt had been overdone.
 The euro fell more than a cent from an earlier one-month
high around $1.3458 on EBS, with traders saying intraday
stop-loss orders were triggered on the break below $1.3375 and
$1.3350. Still, the single currency remained around 3.7 percent
above a four-month low hit on Monday at $1.2860.
 The euro's earlier broad surge extended steep gains the
previous day after European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude
Trichet warned on inflation, prompting speculation the bank may
raise rates earlier than thought. [ID:nLDE70C1WK]
 ""In a week where a lot of higher-yielding and cyclical
currencies have gained, the China move has seen some of those
bets come off and this has helped send euro/dollar lower,"" said
Kit Juckes, currency strategist at Societe Generale.
 He added, however, that China's ""timid tightening"" would
only be a ""speed bump"" for currencies like the Australian and
Canadian dollars which benefit from strong economic fundamentals
and favourable interest rate differentials.
 The euro was down 0.2 percent at $1.3325, with technical
analysts highlighting its failure to hold above the 100-day
moving average at $1.3409 and what looked to be a false break
into the Ichimoku cloud, a closely watched Japanese indicator,
at $1.3399.
 Concerns about the severity of the euro zone's debt problems
lingered and some warned this could leave the euro vulnerable to
renewed selling. Technical analysts also highlighted a bearish
signal after the 55-day euro/dollar moving average crossed below
the 100-day moving average on Thursday.
 The Australian dollar  was down 1 percent on the day
at $0.9870, off an earlier high of $0.9994.
 
 RATE EXPECTATIONS RISE
 The key euro-priced bank-to-bank lending rate jumped on
Friday as expectations for a euro zone rate rise were brought
forward after Trichet's inflation warning on Thursday.
[ID:nLDE70D0UW] 
 ""A lot of banks are busy reassessing their view on when the
ECB will raise interest rates, which is supporting the euro and
adding to the squeezing of short euro positions,"" said Niels
Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 The dollar index <.DXY> was up 0.2 percent at 79.405, having
earlier fallen as low as 78.806. It came under pressure after
weak U.S. jobless claims data on Thursday and as a jump in
yields on top-quality 30-year U.S. municipal bonds sparked
concerns about regional U.S. financing problems. [ID:nN1380259]
 ""We have focused on euro zone problems, U.S. problems and
Asian inflation problems all in the last 24 hours, and that
makes for a bouncy market,"" Societe Generale's Juckes said.
 The euro was up 0.1 percent against the Swiss franc at
1.2880 francs , off an earlier one-month high of
1.2954. The Swiss currency was pressured ahead of talks between
the Swiss government and business, bank and trade union
representatives on the implications of the strong franc.

 * Proposals would cost Russian budget $3 bln
 
 (Adds details, paper report)
 MOSCOW, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The Russian government may
consider increasing the oil product export duty and reducing
crude oil export tariffs, Interfax news agency quoted deputy
finance minister Sergei Shatalov as saying on Friday.
 ""I believe, in one to two months we have to make a decision.
An increase in oil product export duties is not off the agenda.
This could be done together with a decrease in the crude oil
export duty,"" he said.
 Last month, Russia approved a new formula for calculating
oil products export duties, confirming earlier reports that it
would cut duty on light products and increase it on heavy oil.
 Business daily Kommersant reported today that Russia's
Energy Ministry has submitted a new tax regime proposal to the
Finance Ministry that would lower the crude oil export duty by
around 7 percent.
 It would simultaneously raise the unified export duty on oil
products, both light and dark duties taken together, from 60 to
66 percent of the duty levied crude oil, Kommersant said.
 From February, export duties on light oil products are due
to be lowered from 72 percent to 67 percent of a set crude oil
export duty, while fees on heavy oil products will rise to 46.7
percent to stimulate more production of higher grade oil
products.
 But if the Energy Ministry's proposal is taken up, it could
mean a loss of around $3 billion to the Russian budget.
 According to Kommersant, the new proposal would lower the
average crude export duty from $294.9 per tonne under the
current taxation regime to $274.5 per tonne, given the Russia's
Economy Ministry's average oil forecast for 2011 of $81 per
barrel.
 And at $274.5 per tonne, the budget would receive around
$51.6 billion for the full year, down from the $55.4 billion it
would receive under the current tax burden.
 ""This would have positive implications for the companies
with low refining cover, such as Surgutneftegaz, Tatneft and
TNK-BP,"" Citi said in a research report.
 ""It could have negative implications for the companies with
high refining margins, such as Alliance Oil and Gazpromneft,""
the bank wrote.

 A municipal court judge would decide at around 1400 GMT

 ""Between China and Japan there are many issues that need to
be resolved, as well as those on which the two countries hold
different positions,"" Edano told a news conference.
 ""I will insist on non-negotiable issues that are in Japan's
national interest, but I think we can repair ties as we work to
build win-win cooperative ties over issues on which the two
countries share interests.""
 Relations between Japan and China soured last year after
Tokyo arrested a Chinese fishing trawler captain whose boat
collided with Japanese patrol vessels near disputed isles in the
South China sea. Beijing reacted harshly, even after the captain
was released, although ties have thawed somewhat since then.
 Sengoku was censured by the opposition-controlled upper house
for his handling of the row. The government came under fire for
appearing to cave in to China's demands to release the skipper.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The euro fell back from one-month
highs against the dollar and the Australian dollar dipped
sharply on Friday after China raised banks' reserve requirements
by a further 50 basis points.
 China tightening move offered further evidence of the
central bank preparing to allow economic growth to slow as it
battles inflation, causing investors to pare back risk exposure.
This hit equity markets and perceived higher-risk currencies.
 The Aussie was hit the most, given Australia's close links
to China, but the euro also slipped back towards negative
territory against the dollar, reversing a surge earlier in the
day that some felt had been overdone.
 The euro fell back to as much as a cent below an earlier
one-month high around $1.3458 on EBS, with traders saying
intraday stop loss orders were triggered on a break below
$1.3375.
 The single currency's earlier broad surge extended steep
gains the previous day after European Central Bank chief
Jean-Claude Trichet warned on inflation, prompting speculation
the bank may raise rates earlier than thought.
 ""In a week where a lot of higher-yielding and cyclical
currencies have gained, the China move has seen some of those
bets come off and this has helped send euro/dollar lower,"" said
Kit Juckes, currency strategist at Societe Generale.
 He added, however, that China's ""timid tightening"" would
only be a ""speed bump"" for currencies like the Australian and
Canadian dollars which benefit from strong economic fundamentals
and favourable interest rate differentials.
 At 1106 GMT, the euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.3374, with
traders saying a reportedly large option expiry at $1.3400 on
Friday may be influencing price action.
 The single currency had earlier vaulted through reported
stop loss orders above $1.3400, surpassing its 100-day moving
average at $1.3410 and moving back into the Ichimoku cloud -- a
widely observed Japanese technical indicator -- seen as a
bullish signal.
 Concerns about the severity of the euro zone's debt problems
lingered, however, and some warned this could leave the euro
vulnerable to renewed selling. Technical analysts also
highlighted a bearish signal after the 55-day euro/dollar moving
average crossed below the 100-day moving average on Thursday.
 The Australian dollar was down 0.6 percent at $0.9906, well
below an earlier high of $0.9994.
 
 TRICHET LIFTS RATE EXPECTATIONS
 The key euro-priced bank-to-bank lending rate jumped up on
Friday, a day after Trichet ratcheted up ECB rhetoric on
inflation fears in the euro zone, causing many to bring forward
expectations for an interest rate rise.
 ""A lot of banks are busy reassessing their view on when the
ECB will raise interest rates, which is supporting the euro and
adding to the squeezing of short euro positions,"" said Niels
Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 The dollar index was steady at 79.178, having earlier fallen
as low as 78.806. It came under pressure after weak U.S. jobless
claims data on Thursday and as a jump in yields on top-quality
U.S. 30-year municipal bonds sparked concerns about regional
U.S. financing problems.
 ""We have focused on euro zone problems, U.S. problems and
Asian inflation problems all in the last 24 hours, and that
makes for a bouncy market,"" Societe Generale's Juckes said.
 The euro was up 0.4 percent against the Swiss franc at
1.2926 francs, off an earlier one-month high of 1.2954. This
Swiss currency was pressured ahead of talks between the Swiss
government and business, bank and trade union representatives on
the implications of the strong franc.

 By Roman Kozhevnikov
 DUSHANBE, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Tajikistan, after harvesting a
record grain crop last year, plans to become self-sufficient in
cereals by 2015, although drought could trim its harvest this
year, a senior government official told Reuters.
 The Central Asian state harvested 1.26 million tonnes of
grain in 2010, or 70 percent of its domestic needs, and imported
the remainder from Kazakhstan, said Kutfullo Ziyodulloyev, head
of the crop department at the Agriculture Ministry, in an
interview.
 He forecast Tajikistan could produce slightly less this year
than last, given that drought in the past few months has
threatened the winter crop.
 ""If there's a drought, crop yields will fall sharply,"" said
Ziyodulloyev. ""But snow fell today, giving us hope for a harvest
of between 1.20 million and 1.25 million tonnes this year.""
 He added, ""If the weather is good, we might even exceed this
number. There's no way back -- only forward.""
 Tajikistan is the poorest of five former Soviet republics in
Central Asia. Its 7.5 million people consume around 1.8 million
tonnes of grain annually.
 During Soviet times, fields in the mountainous nation,
which borders China and Afghanistan, were used exclusively to
grow cotton, which remains a major revenue earner.
 By comparison, Kazakhstan, the largest producer in the
region, harvested 12.2 million tonnes of grain in clean weight
last year.
 
 IMPORTS, COTTON
 Ziyodulloyev declined to give details about the state
investment that would enable Tajikistan to raise its harvest by
2015, but he said the country planned to achieve its target by
increasing yields, rather than the sowing area.
 Last year's grain crop was marginally higher than in 2009,
the first year that production exceeded 1 million tonnes.
 Wheat production in 2010 totalled 911,821 tonnes, up 5.5
percent from the 864,000 tonnes harvested in the previous year.
 Tajikistan imported $72.4 million worth of flour between
January and November last year, the latest period for which data
from the Agriculture Ministry were available.
 Ziyodulloyev said Tajikistan's cotton crop increased in
2010, reversing a falling trend seen over a few years. The
country harvested 310,513 tonnes of raw cotton in 2010, or 4.9
percent more than in the preceding 12 months.
 Tajikistan earned $168 million from the export of cotton
fibres between January and November 2010, or 16 percent of the
country's total export revenues, ministry data showed. Aluminium
is the country's other main revenue earner.
 The ministry official said he expected raw cotton output to
rise to 350,000 tonnes in 2011 and 600,000 tonnes by 2015. When
Tajikistan was part of the Soviet Union, annual cotton
production regularly reached as high as 1 million tonnes.

 * World stocks ease; Chinese equities down 1.3 percent
 * JPMorgan posts strong quarterly results
 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - World stocks extended losses and
commodities remained under pressure on Friday after China's move
to raise banks' reserve requirements fanned concerns that the
key world growth engine may lose steam.
 The euro fell back from one-month highs against the dollar
 after earlier extending steep gains seen the previous day after
European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet warned on
inflation.
 Futures on the U.S. S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial
average slipped around 0.4 percent, despite strong quarterly
results from lender JPMorgan.
 Futures on the tech-heavy Nasdaq were down 0.1 percent,
though Intel posted better than expected quarterly earnings
overnight. Intel shares in Frankfurt rose 2.6 percent.
 China's 50-basis-point increase in required reserves forced
its banks to lock up more of their cash with the central bank as
Beijing hopes to drain the economy of excess money and tame
rising prices.
 The tightening hit copper prices and speculation about such
a move earlier sent Chinese stocks 1.3 percent lower, while
world stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
extended losses, falling 0.5 percent after hitting a fresh
28-month high in the previous session.
 The euro extended the previous session's sharp rally against
the dollar, before falling back.
 The ECB's remarks surprised markets, which had expected a
more dovish tone and sparked speculation the central bank may
raise interest rates earlier than previously thought.
 ""A lot of banks are busy reassessing their view on when the
ECB will raise interest rates, which is supporting the euro and
adding to the squeezing of short euro positions,"" said Niels
Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 Well received bond sales from highly indebted euro zone
members Portugal and Spain this week and speculation that
European policymakers will boost their war chest against attacks
on euro zone sovereign debt also contributed to the currency's
better tone.
 The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.3361 after hitting a
one-month high earlier and 0.3 percent to 1.2918 Swiss franc.
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance
against a basket of major currencies, reversed earlier losses to
rise marginally to 79.229.
 
 INFLATION FEARS
 Inflation concerns weighed on shorter-dated German debt
prices. The two-year Schatz yield rose by 3 basis points to
1.145 percent, near its highest since mid-December.
 Portuguese and Irish spreads held steady.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 dropped 0.9 percent,
pressured by commodity-related stocks as copper prices fell 0.5
percent and oil lost 1.2 percent.
 ""Thin markets have seen some really nasty moves this week.
Too much euphoria and too little joined-up thinking,"" said
Nicole Elliott at Mizuho Corporate Bank in London.
 ""When Spain's IBEX (stock index) rallied 10.5 percent in
three days and India drops 8 percent in two weeks you know
things are unstable.""
 Japan's Nikkei average fell 0.9 percent after a surprisingly
weak settlement of options for January and a stronger yen
against the dollar trigger profit-taking.

334,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2011 04:56AM ET</span>",UK Dec producer prices rise faster than expected," LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - British factory gate inflation
rose faster than expected in December to its highest annual rate
since April, driven by a sharp rise in the price of crude oil
and food input costs, official data showed on Friday.
 The news is likely to concern the Bank of England as
consumer price inflation is already more than a percentage point
above its 2 percent target and is forecast to rise towards 4
perce nt in the coming months.
 The Office for National Statistics said producer output
prices rose 4.2 percent in December, slightly above forecasts
for an annual rise of 3.9 percent. On the month, output prices
were up 0.5 percent, versus a 0.4 percent forecast.
 December input prices were 12.5 percent higher on the year
-- also the highest annual rate since April -- compared with a
9.2 percent annual rise in November and against forecasts fo r
an annual rate of 10.4 percent.
 Economists had expected some acceleration in input costs due
to higher oil and gas prices and the weaker pound.
 A slowdown in the growth of labour costs had been expected
to keep output prices more steady.
 Stripping out input costs for food and petroleum industries,
the annual rate of input price inflation in December rose to 8.8
percent from 7.5 percent on a seasonally-adjusted basis.
 The rise in the cost of crude oil over the year contributed
almost half of the annual rise in input cost inflation, with
increases in the cost of home produced food and imported metals
also playing a significant role.
 The cost of crude oil inputs is 26.2 percent higher than a
year ago, its highest annual rise since May 2010.
 This is having a knock-on impact on fuel inputs, which are
rising at their fastest annual pace since May 2009.
 The cost of home-produced food materials is 11.3 percent
higher on the year -- its biggest annual rise since 2008.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The euro hit a one-month high
against the dollar on Friday, extending a rally due to tough
talk on inflation from the European Central Bank and an easing
of debt worries after solid bond sales by Portugal and Spain.
 The euro also hit a one-month high versus the Swiss franc,
under pressure ahead of talks between the Swiss government and
business, bank and trade union representatives on the
implications of the strong franc.
 Against the dollar, the single currency passed $1.3450,
easily surpassing a high of $1.3383 hit on Thursday when
comments by ECB chief Jean-Claude Trichet prompted speculation
that the bank may raise rates earlier than thought.
 There was little evidence of that in money markets, but
dealers said many in the market had expected a more dovish tone
from the ECB given continuing risks to European growth from
budget problems. 
 ""A lot of banks are busy reassessing their view on when the
ECB will raise interest rates, which is supporting the euro and
adding to the squeezing of short euro positions,"" said Niels
Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 He added that ahead of a long weekend in the United States,
market players may be unwilling to hold onto long dollar
positions.
 The euro rose 0.7 percent to hit a one-month high against
the dollar of $1.3456, according to Reuters data, surpassing the
Jan. 4 high of $1.3433. At 0855 GMT it stood at $1.3425.
Traders said stop loss orders were triggered on the break of
$1.3400, with the single currency surpassing its 100-day moving
average at $1.3410. It also moved back into the Ichimoku cloud
-- a widely observed Japanese technical indicator -- seen as a
bullish signal.
 The dollar also stayed under pressure after weak U.S.
jobless claims data on Thursday, with the dollar index falling
as low as 78.806, coming close to a seven-week low of 78.775.
 
 BROAD EURO GAINS
 The franc extended falls versus the euro a day after its
sharpest one-day fall since September, hitting a low of 1.2954
francs to the euro.
 Against the yen, the euro rose 0.2 percent to hit a
four-week high around 110.92 yen, moving above its 55-day moving
average at 110.85, with traders reporting offers in the
111.00-30 yen area.
 The single currency also rose to a one-month high against
the higher-yielding Australian dollar.
 Strong demand in Spain's bond auction on Thursday, a day
after a solid Portuguese debt sale, helped ease pressure on
peripheral bond markets, supporting the euro.
 Analysts said the euro may also be helped by speculation
that European policy-makers could be ready to increase the size
and scope of a rescue fund.
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Thursday
that debate about boosting the current fund was not realistic.
However, he did say he was open to discussion about helping the
existing fund make full use of its potential resources.
 But concerns about the severity of the euro zone's debt
problems lingered and some warned it could leave the euro
vulnerable.
 ""The euro's latest rise is nothing more than short-covering
from overselling late last year on an excessively bearish view
on the euro zone,"" said Tsutomu Soma, manager of foreign
securities at Okasan Securities in Tokyo.
 ""Given that the fiscal problems in the region are
unresolved, investors will be cautious about chasing the
currency higher.""

 * In talks to raise prices, to build new China plant
 * Says well hedged against rising Taiwan dollar
(Recasts; adds quotes, details)
 TAIPEI, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Taiwan's Compal Electronics Inc,
the world's No.2 contract laptop PC maker, forecast higher
shipments for this year but noted that new tablet models were
likely to cut the global market share of notebooks.
 In a news briefing on Friday, President Ray Chen said the
release of Google Inc's Android tablet this year would be a key
event for the notebook industry.
 ""We expect the market share of notebook PCs to be cut into by
Google's tablet, and to drop faster after (it is released),"" Chen
said.
 Analysts have expressed concern over the possibility that
tablet sales this year could cannibalise Compal's notebook
business. The global tablet segment is expected to more than
triple to 50 million units in 2011, with Apple Inc seen as by far
the dominant vendor.
 Research group Gartner said it expected tablets to displace
about 10 percent of PC sales by 2014.
 Compal said it expected notebook shipments to reach 55
million units this year, 15 percent higher than last year's 48
million, and was targetting tablet PC shipments of 3.8 million in
2011.
 Analysts also see pricing pressure on the contract maker from
major customer Acer Inc, which will lead to thinning margins.
Acer would account for about 47 percent of Compal's 2011
shipments, according to a UBS report.
 Chen said the company was in talks with customers to raise
prices ""but not all of the increase in costs will be borne by
customers"", he added without elaborating.
 The company also said it planned a new plant in the western
Chinese city of Chongqing, where many hi-tech firms have
relocated in search of new markets and lower costs in China's
interior.
 ""We have customers in Chongqing and (nearby) Chengdu, so we
will start building a plant in Chongqing, to start operations in
July,"" Chen said.
 Compal reported unconsolidated December sales of T$60.29
billion ($2.07 billion), up 14.1 percent from the same month a
year earlier. Full-year sales rose 34.86 percent to T$844.51
billion.
 It said the rising Taiwan dollar was not a problem as the
company was well hedged.

 * Main issues will not be solved by November, officials say
 
 By Daniel Flynn
 PARIS, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Nicholas Sarkozy has called for a
new Bretton Woods system for managing the global economy but two
months into France's G20 presidency, officials are playing down
hopes of a major breakthrough on monetary reform.
 The French president made discussion of how to wean the
world off its reliance on the dollar a top priority of his
year-long stewardship of the Group of 20, which began in
November, alongside an overhaul of global economic governance
and tackling volatility of commodities prices.
 Faced by reticence and confusion among G20 partners, French
officials are trying to manage the high expectations set by
Sarkozy's rhetoric, acknowledging progress may be slow going as
the G20 moves out of crisis mode to address more complex issues.
 ""Many of the issues tackled under our G20 presidency, they
are not going to be solved in one year,"" said Benoit Coeure,
deputy head of France's Treasury. ""Reform of the international
monetary system, this is not going to be over in November 2011.""
 Sarkozy appeared to moderate his tone after meeting U.S.
President Barack Obama last week to canvass opinion on his G20
agenda before a key policy speech on Jan. 24. In the face of
Washington's intransigence, Sarkozy said the dollar's role was
set by the market and there was no alternative at present.
 Officials say France already has its hands full with more
pressing issues like clinching agreeing on ""indicative
guidelines"" for global economic imbalances, as mandated by
November's G20 summit in Seoul. Exporters like Germany and China
and commodities producers like Saudi Arabia oppose strict rules.
 A G20 finance ministers meeting in Paris next month will be
more procedural and is unlikely to produce any big advances,
according to a senior government source: ""We'll not start to get
decisions until the IMF spring meeting in Washington in April.""
 On global governance, where France favours creating an
institutional framework for the G20 such as a permanent
secretariat to make it the main international forum for
decision-making, there is resistance from some G20 partners.
 ""I don't see any reason to make the G20 an institution at
the level of other international organisations like the IMF,""
Japan's vice minister for international affairs, Rintaro Tamaki,
told Reuters, adding he also backed a continued role for the G7.
 ""I hope the G20 can deliver something by November but to do
this we have to narrow down the scope ... People do not
understand what we are going to discuss,"" he said.

 'STILL A PROBLEM OF TRUST'
 IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard said G20 discussion of
indicators for global imbalances -- due to be concluded by June
-- is being complicated by differences over economic theory,
even among developed countries: while Washington sees strong
fiscal stimulus as indispensible, Germany is much more austere.
 ""There is still a problem of trust,"" Blanchard said, noting
some countries were not giving honest assessments of their
economies for fear of criticism by G20 peers. ""This is a process
which has only just started ... There is a long way to go.""
 France's presidency has abandoned a 4 percent threshold for
current account imbalances proposed by U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner last year, and is focusing on less specific
indicators to encourage members like China to come on board.
 ""If these (signals) indicate red, then the mandate will be
for an organisation like the IMF to look into it and say either
let's not worry or let's worry some,"" Blanchard said. ""The
purpose is to allow dialogue between G20 ministers.""
 A senior official at the presidential palace said discussion
of reserve currencies -- such as wider use of the IMF's Special
Drawing Right and a greater role for China's yuan -- was further
down France's agenda ""if we have the time"".
 French officials have suggested setting a timetable for the
yuan's entry into the SDR's basket of currencies could be one
achievement of their presidency, but Washington is reluctant to
concede this without more yuan exchange rate flexibility.
 ""China is very anxious to have its currency included in the
SDR and they could even press ahead in easing capital controls
if that happens,"" said Harvard professor Jeffrey Frankel, one of
several prominent economists consulted by Sarkozy's government.
 Having assiduously tried to improve ties with Beijing,
partly by avoiding criticism of the yuan's valuation, Sarkozy
risks seeing his efforts undermined by reports France is
investigating Chinese links to industrial espionage at Renault.
 ""If it's true, it would certainly poison Sino-French
relations,"" said Francois Godement of the European Council on
Foreign Relations.
 
 FOOD PRICES RISING UP THE AGENDA
 French officials recognise their G20 agenda is at the mercy
of events, such as any deepening of the euro zone crisis. Rises
in global food prices have also added urgency to its plans to
more strictly regulate commodities markets. [ID:nLDE70A0VP]
 Expanding the usual G20 format, Paris is planning an
agriculture ministers meeting by June to discuss tougher rules
on commodities trading to prevent speculation.
 Paris wants more accurate data on commodities inventories
and production, as well as the creation of regional food
stockpiles. It would also like to see global implementation of
U.S. rules on derivatives trading which prevent players from
acquiring a dominant market position to squeeze prices.
 Such measures have broad support from several countries in
Latin America and Asia, but officials say here as well progress
will face many hurdles.
""Commodity reform ... is even more complex than monetary
reform because you have to get lots of different people from
very different areas in the same room: NGOs, agriculture
ministers, derivatives regulators,"" said one government source.
 ""It is going to depend on the price of wheat.""

convinced investors its debt position is sustainable and further

 In an interview with Bloomberg news agency late on Thursday,
Naoyuki Shinohara, deputy managing director of the International

 ""That means that scepticism over the sustainability of their

 Heavily-indebted Spain and Portugal staged successful bond
issues this week, easing some concerns about an escalation of
euro zone debt strife and buying the bloc's leaders more time to
come up with a new package of anti-crisis measures, which
analysts say is both essential and urgent.
 Following rescues of Greece and Ireland last year, Portugal
and Spain are seen as the euro zone countries most at risk of

 Li's remarks came ahead of a state visit by President Hu

 ""We will closely monitor and analyse the impact of reforms in

suffer if the yuan rises too quickly. Beijing says it should not
be pressured over the value of its own currency. Even so, the
central bank has been guiding the yuan to record highs against
the dollar ahead of Hu's U.S. visit. [CNY/]
 The yuan has risen nearly 3.5 percent against the dollar
since it ended its peg to the U.S. currency in June. From the
time of its landmark revaluation in 2005, the currency has risen
about 25 percent.
 Asserting that Chinese businesses have taken a firmer yuan in
stride, Li said exports from labour-intensive sectors have
recovered to levels seen before the global financial crisis.
 He said China's overall shipments abroad have also hit a
steady string of record highs.
 China's central bank is the country's leading proponent for a
stronger yuan since it wants a firmer currency to help balance
the nation's trade account. Yuan policy is decided by top leaders
in China's government, which also controls the central bank.
 Huo Jianguo, a director at the Chinese Academy of
International Trade and Economic Cooperation, a think tank linked
to the trade ministry, said Chinese exporters need to guard
against currency risks.
 ""Importers and exporters must establish a counter-risk
system,"" Huo told the same forum. ""You must make changes any time
you feel there is a rising currency risk. Otherwise, when risks
come together, it'll be too late to do anything.""

 BEIJING, Jan 14 (Reuters) - China will not bow to foreign
demand for faster gains in the yuan and will stick to its
gradualist approach in currency reform, senior officials said
on Friday, indicating Chinese President Hu Jintao may push
back if President Barack Obama presses him on the issue next
week.	
 Obama is likely to raise U.S. complaints at a summit with
Hu on Jan 19 that Beijing maintains the yuan at artificially
weak levels, giving China an unfair trade advantage.	
 But Cui Tiankai, a vice foreign minister, said: ""First of
all, I want to say that in undertaking reform of the exchange
rate formation mechanism for the renminbi ... that is based on
China's own developmental interests and needs, and is not in
response to demands from another country.""	
 ""Of course, in doing this, that can benefit both China's
own reform and opening up and development, and also trade and
economic relations with other countries, including with the
United States,"" he added, speaking at a forum hosted by the
Foreign Ministry.	
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Wednesday
that Washington was ""willing to make progress"" in giving China
greater access to the American market and high-tech goods,
provided that it saw some flexibility from Beijing on its
tightly controlled exchange rate regime. [ID:nN12191046]

 YUAN SET FOR GRADUAL RISE 
 The yuan has risen nearly 3.5 percent against the dollar
since Beijing ended its peg to the dollar in June. From the
time of its landmark revaluation in 2005, the Chinese currency
has risen about 25 percent.	
 The central bank has guided the yuan to record highs
before Hu's visit. A Chinese central bank adviser said last
week that it was expected to rise between 5 and 6 percent this
year.	
 China, the largest creditor to the United States, has
voiced concern about aggressive U.S. government spending and
ultra-loose monetary policy that it says could sap the dollar
and hit its U.S. investments.	
 Cui said he agreed with a comment he cited as coming from
Geithner: ""Both sides have a great deal invested in each
other's success"".	
 Hu and Obama will discuss a wide range of issues from the
global economy to human rights when they meet at the White
House next week.	
 ""China's development will not threaten or harm the United
States' interests, and will instead bring more opportunities
of all kinds for the United States and its people,"" Cui said.	
 ""Likewise, a United States that stays prosperous and
strengthens cooperation is beneficial for China's development.""

 Obama is likely to urge Hu to increase pressure on his ally
North Korea, which triggered regional alarm by shelling a South

 * Some see more short-covering if resistance broken
 * Soft U.S. jobless claims data weighs on dollar
 * Yen hits 1-week high vs greenback
 By Chikako Mogi and Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The euro succumbed to light
profit-taking on Friday, a day after staging its biggest surge in
six months on solid debt sales by Spain and tough talk on
inflation by the chief of the European Central Bank.
 Speculation that European policy-makers may top up their war
chest against attacks on euro zone sovereign debt is adding fuel
to short-covering even though many market players suspect worries
about the solvency of peripheral euro zone members will persist.
 ""The euro's latest rise is nothing more than short-covering
from overselling late last year on an excessively bearish view on
the euro zone. Given that the fiscal problems in the region are
unresolved, investors will be cautious about chasing the currency
higher,"" said Tsutomu Soma, manager of foreign securities at
Okasan Securities.
 The euro slipped 0.2 percent in Asia to $1.3330, after
climbing as high as $1.3383 the previous day.
 The single currency had risen more than 3 percent from a
four-month low of $1.2960 marked at the start of the week, making
it ripe for profit-taking.
 Its 55-day moving average, which was $1.3389 on Thursday and
$1.3378 on Friday, is serving as immediate resistance, though a
break of that level could spark another wave of short-covering.
 If that happens, levels just above $1.34 could be the next
hurdle, where it has a 38.2 percent retracement of the
November-January slide as well as an Ichimoku cloud base.
 The euro also dropped 0.5 percent against the yen to 110.11
yen as Japanese exporters took advantage of its rise to a
three-week high of 110.67 yen on Thursday to sell the currency.
 But the common currency did less badly on other crosses.
 It stood at 1.2855 Swiss franc, not far from Thursday's
one-month high of 1.2885 as the franc comes under pressure ahead
of a meeting later in the day between the Swiss government and
representatives from Swiss business associations, banks and trade
unions to discuss the implications of the strong franc.
 The euro also stayed close to a one-month high against the
Australian dollar.
 SPAIN DEMAND
 Strong demand in Spain's bond auction on Thursday, a day
after a solid Portuguese debt sale, helped ease pressure on
peripheral bond markets for now.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet also said prices needed to
be monitored very closely after euro zone inflation jumped last
month, hinting the bank could raise interest rates to contain
inflation even while the bloc is gripped by a debt crisis.
 His comments surprised market players, who had expected the
bank to take a more dovish line at a time when some euro zone
countries are facing strains in fund-raising.
 Analysts said the euro may see some support on speculation
that European policy-makers could be ready to increase the size
and scope of a rescue fund.
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Thursday
that it was too early to talk about the size of a permanent
European bailout fund and that debate about boosting the current
fund was not realistic.
 However, he did say he was open to discussion about helping
the existing fund make full use of its potential resources.
 Although Germany has repeatedly rejected in public calls to
extend the 440 billion euro ($570.3 billion) European Financial
Stability Facility, Berlin has been discussing the possibility
with its partners behind the scenes.
 Some market players also said weak U.S. jobless claims data
had hurt the dollar, indirectly helping the euro. Initial jobless
claims rose to a 10-week high and sent U.S. bond yields lower.
 ""When you look at the market yesterday, the dollar was
broadly weak after the initial jobless claims data. So you could
argue that the market may be starting to focus on the U.S.
economy, at least temporarily,"" said Junya Tanase, a strategist
at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank.
 Lower U.S. bond yields helped bring down the dollar to a
one-week low of 82.47 yen, not far from the bottom of the
ichimoku cloud, which will sit at 82.31 yen until the middle of
next week.
 A break below the cloud is considered a major bear signal.
 As the greenback fell broadly after the data, the index of
the dollar against a basket of currencies stood at 79.20, not far
from the bottom of its trading band since December at 78.775.
 DATA RAFT
 While many market players expect the dollar to be supported
around December lows, a minority think it may come under pressure
if a raft of U.S. data due later in the day, including retail
sales and consumer prices, fall short of market expectations.
 Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corp, said the euro could test its December peak of $1.35 and
that the dollar could trouble a low of 80.93 yen hit at the start
of this month.
 ""It would be futile to attempt to keep selling the euro on
the debt crisis when Europe already has a safety net. I expect
broad selling in the dollar,"" Uno said.

minister said on Friday.
 Speaking at a forum, Li Rongcan said even though Chinese
exports and imports have recovered to levels seen before the
financial crisis, China still faces a number of downside risks
including slowing external demand and rising trade protectionism.
 The United States restricts exports of high-technology
products to China due to concerns that ambitious Chinese firms
will steal its intellectual property and because some of the
technology has dual applications that could be diverted for
military uses.
 ""We should pay more attention to imports to promote trade
balance and implement more effective import strategies,"" Li said.
 ""We must push developed nations to lift their restrictions on
export of high-tech products to China,"" he added.
 China has repeatedly pledged to balance its trade account by
importing more, in part due to pressure from trade partners to
pull more weight as a consumer, and as it seeks to reduce its
economic dependence on exports.
 Efforts to raise imports are bearing fruit, with China's
global trade surplus narrowing in 2010 for the second straight
year to $183 billion, from $196 billion in 2009. [ID:nTOE709033]

 * Asian stocks lacklustre, Nikkei off 8-mth peak
 * Copper, oil slip on disappointing U.S. data

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The euro took a breather in
Asia on Friday, but was still on track to post its best weekly
performance against the dollar in 20 months, while equity
markets were lacklustre with Japan's Nikkei retreating from an
8-month peak.	
 The common currency, last at $1.3330 , raced to a
high of $1.3383 on Thursday after the European Central Bank
caught markets off guard by hinting it could lift interest
rates to contain inflation, even while the bloc was tackling a
debt crisis.	
 The hawkish comments followed interest rate hikes in
Thailand and South Korea this week as policymakers grow
increasingly worried about inflationary pressure.	
 ""The signals from the ECB also reinforce our view that it
will hike before the Fed does,"" said Ken Wattret, BNP Paribas
chief eurogroup market economist.	
 ""As relatively little in the way of rate hikes has been
priced in for this year, the market is likely to continue to
shift in the direction of early tightening, absent a
resurgence in market volatility.""	
 The euro's rise marked an impressive turnaround from a
four-month low around $1.2871 on Monday and set the scene for
a retest of the December high of $1.3500. It is up about 3.5
percent this week, the biggest weekly rise since May 2009.	
 Well-received bond sales from highly indebted euro zone
members Portugal and Spain this week and speculation that
European policymakers will boost their war chest against
attacks on euro zone sovereign debt all contributed to the
currency's better tone.	
 Gains in the euro saw the dollar index , which
tracks the greenback's performance against a basket of major
currencies, retreat to below 80.000 from this week's high of
81.313.	
 But Tsutomu Soma, manager of foreign securities at Okasan
Securities, said the euro's rise was nothing more than
short-covering from overselling late last year on excessively
bearish view on the euro zone.	
 ""Given that the fiscal problems in the region are
unresolved, investors will be cautious about chasing the
currency higher.""	
 
 STOCKS SUBDUED	
 Meanwhile, Asian shares were generally softer as investors
took profits on recent sharp gains and as a pullback in oil
and metals prices hit stocks of resource companies. 
 Japan's Nikkei average slipped 0.3 percent, a day
after hitting an eight-month high, while stocks elsewhere in
Asia edged down 0.1 percent.	
 South Korea's KOSPI was flat, Australia's S&P/ASX
200 index lost 0.2 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng
index was 0.1 percent lower.	
 POSCO fell more than 1 percent after the
world's No.3 steelmaker disappointed investors with its fourth
quarter earnings and warned it was struggling to pass on
higher costs of raw materials. [ID:nTOE70B047]	
 Global miners like BHP Billiton were also under
pressure with base metal prices weakening, partly on
disappointing U.S. data, which showed jobless benefits claims
hitting a 10-week high.	
 Copper fell 0.5 percent to $9.567.25 per tonne,
while U.S. crude  was 0.4 percent lower at around $91 a
barrel.

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The euro surged on Thursday,
taking on renewed vigor after better-than-forecast debt
auctions by Spain and Italy and a hawkish rate view from the
ECB but weak U.S. jobless claims data weighed on U.S. stocks.
 Wall Street struggled from the start of the day, trading in
tight ranges before closing lower. Stocks in Tokyo are poised
to open weaker after closing at an eight-month high on
Wednesday. The Nikkei March futures contract traded in Chicago
was down 30 points at 10,590 .
 The euro got an extra boost after European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet said the euro-zone economy faces
short-term inflationary pressures. The ECB had earlier left
interest rates unchanged at 1 percent. [ID:nLDE70C0KF]
 ""He sent a mild warning to markets that the ECB's
assessment on interest rates could change,"" said Commerzbank
economist Michael Schubert.
 Oil prices see-sawed but ultimately closed lower on the
day, undermined by the jobless claims report and the prospect
OPEC would raise output should prices break above $100 a barrel
for an extended period. [ID:nLDE70C1QS]
 Grain prices in Chicago traded touched their highest levels
in 2-1/2 years on food price inflation and supply concerns.
 Gold prices fell after being unable to benefit from a
weaker U.S. dollar.
 European shares closed lower, although Spanish banks

 NEW YORK, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The euro rose the most against
the dollar in six months on Thursday and further gains were
expected in the near term following solid Spanish and
Portuguese debt auctions and after the head of the European
Central Bank expressed concerns about inflation.
 At the session peak, the euro climbed to near $1.34 as its
sharp rebound prompted investors to cover short positions. At
current prices, the euro was on track for its best weekly
performance since May, 2009, though some analysts cautioned
that the euro's downtrend is far from over.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said price stability was
not under threat, remarks that drove expectations the ECB could
raise interest rates, helping to spark the short-covering. For
details, see [ID:nLDE70C0KF]
 Strong demand at Spain's bond auction, one day after a
solid Portuguese debt sale, helped ease pressure on peripheral
bond markets, although analysts noted sales represented a very
small percentage of supply from those countries this year.
 ""We can make another run probably to just above $1.34,
after which I would look to fade the move,"" said Paresh
Upadhyaya, head of Americas G10 FX Strategy at BofA Merrill
Lynch Global Research in New York. ""From a longer-term
perspective, the factors that are at play are euro negative.
Funding concerns will continue to weigh on the euro in the
first quarter.""
 TRICHET SUPER SIZE
 The euro  climbed as high as $1.3383 on trading
platform EBS, almost 3 cents above the day's low at $1.3088. It
last traded up 1.68 percent at $1.3350, on pace for its biggest
one-day rise since July 1.
 Gains pushed the euro close to the 100-day simple moving
average at $1.3404 using EBS prices after powering through the
50-day SMA at $1.3324.
 ""The hawkish comments from ECB's Trichet today have
super-sized the move,"" said Andrew Busch, global currency
strategist at BMO Capital Markets in Chicago in a note.
 He put the euro trading range between $1.2900 and $1.3500.
 Traders cited buying from Asian central banks and demand
from momentum players, options players and investment funds.
 Goldman Sachs on Thursday recommended going long euro
against the dollar, targeting $1.37, saying European sovereign
debt tensions will ultimately ease. [ID:nN13285674]
 SOME SUPPORT
 Analysts said the euro may see some support on speculation
that a solution to the debt crisis may come soon. Top European
Union officials are pushing for the bloc to increase the size
and scope of the 440 billion euro ($574 billion) rescue fund.
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on
Wednesday that euro zone countries are working on a
""comprehensive package"" that may be agreed upon by February or
March, to solve the crisis. [ID:nLDE70B2BE]
 But Raghav Subbarao, currency strategist at Barclays
Capital, said in the medium term there are still concerns about
how debt problems will be resolved.
 He said Portugal's snowballing debt-financing costs will
ultimately force Lisbon to ask for a bailout, while Spain faces
a hefty rollover of existing debt in April. Still, a bailout
for Madrid was unlikely, Subbarao said.
 The euro climbed to a one-month high of 1.2885 Swiss francs
 ahead of an emergency meeting of Swiss unions and

 * Energy imports cost Morocco around $8 bln a year
 * Cabinet also okays draft law for nuclear security

 RABAT, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Morocco, the only North African
country that has no oil or gas of its own, on Thursday approved
creation of an agency to ensure nuclear plant safety, helping
advance slow-moving plans for its first nuclear reactors.
 Authorities last year said the country's first two
1-gigawatt nuclear reactors would come into operation after 2020
and that the first international tenders for the plants would be
launched between 2011 and 2014.
 Morocco spent 64.7 billion dirhams ($7.6 billion) on energy
imports for the period January-November 2010, up from 54.2
billion in all of 2009, official data shows.
 The official MAP news agency said the cabinet on Thursday
approved setting up the agency as well as a draft law governing
nuclear security.
 The agency is important because it would handle cooperation
with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in pushing
forward and monitoring the project.
 The draft law defines processes that authorise and control
all activities that use ""ionizing radiation"", MAP said, quoting
a government spokesman.
 Among other issues, those processes cover ""authorised
installations and activities, approvals for providers of
technical assistance in the field of (nuclear) security,
informing the public on the setting up of a national emergency
plan and a national system for the control and compatibility of
nuclear material,"" it added.
 Companies from several countries including France, Russia
and Japan have watched Morocco's slow progress in realising its
nuclear energy ambitions.
 
 SOLAR LAUNCH LIFTS NUCLEAR HOPES
 But the launch last year of a more than $9 billion solar
energy programme has revived optimism that Morocco, which wants
to export renewable electricity to Europe, will make faster
strides towards developing its first nuclear power plants.
 Morocco hopes its solar programme will account for 38
percent of the country's installed power generation capacity by
2020.
 Russia's Atomstroyeksport in 2007 was among firms that
expressed interest in providing Morocco with its first nuclear
power plant. But in July, Rabat and Paris signed an agreement
for the development of a civilian nuclear energy programme.
 Energy Minister Amina Benkhadra told French newspaper Les
Echos in June that France would help its former protectorate
build its first nuclear power plants.
 Morocco aims to export surplus electricity to Europe via
Spain. Morocco's state-run power utility ONE doubled the
capacity of its interconnector to Spain to 400 megawatts in
2007.
 Moroccan officials say they intend to use uranium extracted
from vast phosphate deposits in the country as feedstock for the
planned nuclear power plants. The country of 32 million sits on
nearly half the world's phosphate reserves, including deposits
in the disputed Western Sahara.

 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary
Gary Locke complained that China often fails to keep promises
to open its markets and called for a ""more equitable
commercial relationship,"" days before China's president visits
Washington.
 ""When I talk to business leaders across America, they
continue to express significant concerns -- shared by business
around the world -- about the commercial environment in
China,"" Locke said on Thursday.
 The U.S. government also is frustrated that Chinese
officials often make promises to address market access
barriers or other concerns, but a year or more later, little
has changed, Locke said.
 ""Perhaps an agreement is made, but it never becomes
binding. Or perhaps there's a well-written law or regulation
at the national level, but there's lax enforcement at the
provincial or city level,"" he said.
 The remarks by Locke, the latest in a series of China
policy speeches by the Obama cabinet ahead of Chinese
President Hu Jintao's visit next week, followed a speech on
Wednesday by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.
 Geithner urged Beijing to move faster in allowing its
currency to appreciate, to remove other trade barriers and to
revise policies that forcefully tilt the China market playing
field in the favor of Chinese firms.
 President Barack Obama hosts Hu for a state visit on Jan.
19. Administration officials say he will raise big
geopolitical problems such as Iran and North Korea as well as
the global economy, and trade issues that bedevil ties between
the world's two biggest economies.
 New trade figures released on Thursday showed the U.S.
trade deficit with China alone totaled $252 billion during the
first 11 months of 2010, keeping it on track to surpass the
annual record of $268 billion in 2008.
 U.S.-CHINA QUID PRO QUO?
 Locke echoed U.S. companies' complaints about a host of
Chinese government policies they say discriminate against
foreign firms and threaten to undermine long-term U.S.
economic growth by requiring companies to transfer technology
to Chinese partners in order to participate in the Chinese
market.
 Geithner in his speech on Wednesday rapped those Chinese
policies, but extended an offer to free up trade in high-tech
goods and address other Chinese concerns, provided that it saw
some give from Beijing on its tightly controlled exchange rate
regime and other policies. [ID:nN12191046]
 Many U.S. lawmakers direct their ire at China's currency
policy. They contend China deliberately undervalues its yuan
 by as much as 15 percent to 40 percent to give its
companies an unfair price advantage.
 Economist Derek Scissors said Geithner's help-us-help-you
approach was ""reasonable"" but that Washington needed to focus
on bigger issues than China's nominal exchange rate.
 ""If we ask the Chinese to do hard things, then we're going
to have to offer something else in return,"" he said.
 Chinese officials declined to comment on Geithner's idea,
but a series of advisers and analysts said that it was
unlikely to jump at a trade-for-currency deal.

 ENVIRONMENT WORRIES INVESTORS
 Representatives of more than 100 Chinese companies will
also be in town next week, setting the stage for a number of
business deals that Obama could tout as helping to reach his
goal of doubling U.S. exports.
 Locke declined to comment on possible deals to be signed.
 The United States and China must make good on promises to
reduce the huge imbalances ""because they have the potential to
threaten global stability and prosperity,"" Locke said.
 ""We need a more equitable commercial relationship. And it
is within our reach,"" Locke said, acknowledging that China is
already a ""fairer"" market for foreign companies than it was 10
years ago even though more work needs to be done.
 Last month, China made a number of promises during
high-level trade talks to reduce the use of pirated software
and remove administrative and regulatory barriers to American
sales of everything from beef to industrial machinery to
telecommunications devices.
 Bill Reinsch, president of the National Foreign Trade
Council, whose members include Boeing , Caterpillar
 and other major U.S. exporters, said the worsening
commercial environment in China is causing companies to
rethink where they make future investments.
 ""The Chinese have made no secret of the fact that they
want our technology and that's the key to our competitive
advantage. So, it's no surprise that companies don't
particularly want to surrender that,"" Reinsch said.

 NEW YORK, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The euro surged on Thursday,
taking on renewed vigor after better-than-forecast debt

rates at a record low 1 percent, said there is ""evidence of
short-term upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing
to energy prices.""
 Although Trichet said that price stability was not under
threat, his remarks drove expectations that the ECB could raise
interest rates, helping to spark a round of short-covering on
the euro. See [ID:nLDE70C0KF]
 The euro climbed more than 1.5 percent to near $1.34,
extending its sharp rebound this week. The euro was on track
for its best weekly performance since March 2009. Analysts
cautioned, however, the euro's downtrend is far from over.
 ""Trichet's frank acceptance of the nascent signs of
inflation in the region and his pledge that the bank will 'do
what is necessary' to control price pressures helped fuel a
vicious short-covering rally in euro/dollar,"" said Boris
Schlossberg, director of currency research at GFT in New York.
 And strong demand at Spain's bond auction, one day after a
solid Portuguese debt sale, helped ease pressure on peripheral
bond markets. Analysts cautioned, however, that the sales
represented a very small percentage of supply from those
countries this year.
 ""We can make another run probably to just above $1.34,
after which I would look to fade the move,"" said Paresh
Upadhyaya, head of Americas G10 FX Strategy at BofA Merrill
Lynch Global Research in New York. ""From a longer-term
perspective, the factors that are at play are euro negative.
Funding concerns will continue to weigh on the euro in the
first quarter.""
 The euro  climbed as high as $1.3376 on trading
platform EBS, almost 3 cents above the day's low at $1.3088. It
last traded up 1.7 percent at $1.336, on pace for its biggest
one-day gain since July.
 Traders cited steady buying from Asian central banks and
demand from momentum players, options players and investment
funds.
 GOLDMAN GOES LONG EURO
 Goldman Sachs on Thursday recommended going long euro
against the dollar, targeting $1.37, saying European sovereign
debt tensions will ultimately ease. See [ID:nN13285674]
 ""Our view has long been that European sovereign tensions
will ultimately abate on a combination of better fiscal
coordination, support from the strong euro zone countries for
the periphery, solid growth in the euro zone as a whole and
signs of reform success in the periphery,"" the firm said in a
research note.
 Analysts said the euro may see some support on speculation
that a solution to the debt crisis may come soon. Top European
Union officials are pushing for the bloc to increase the size
and scope of the 440 billion euro ($574 billion) rescue fund.
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on
Wednesday that euro zone countries are working on a
""comprehensive package,"" which may be agreed by February or
March, to solve the crisis. [ID:nLDE70B2BE]
 But Raghav Subbarao, currency strategist at Barclays
Capital, said in the medium term there are still concerns about
how debt problems will be resolved.
 He said Portugal's snowballing debt-financing costs will
ultimately force Lisbon to ask for a bailout, while Spain faces
a hefty rollover of existing debt in April. Still, a bailout
for Madrid was unlikely, Subbarao said.
 The euro climbed to a one-month high of 1.2885 Swiss francs
 ahead of an emergency meeting of Swiss unions and
industry representatives, with the subject expected to be the
record-strong Swiss currency.
 The dollar fell 0.3 percent to 82.73 yen  after U.S.
jobless claims jumped to their highest level since October
dented optimism about the U.S. economy, though analysts
cautioned against reading too much into the data. See

 * Lobby group says EU firms suffering in Asia and Africa
 
 (Adds possible challenge on environmental technology)
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Jan 13 (Reuters) - European trade officials have
requested industry data that could allow the European Union to
challenge China over cheap credit to Chinese firms, according to
EU officials and correspondence seen by Reuters.
 The initiative, led by the EU executive, the Commission, and
Europe's largest business group, BusinessEurope, highlights
Europe's determination to face down what EU businesses and
officials say is unfair competition from China that is costing
European firms lost contracts around the world.
 ""EU authorities will need, from those ready to contribute,
concrete evidence of cases where favourable Chinese export
credits and guarantees seem to have led to a distortion of
competition,"" said a BusinessEurope email dated Jan. 6 and
obtained by Reuters. EU firms were asked to reply by Jan. 28.
 ""BusinessEurope and EU authorities are interested in getting
in contact with interested associations and in particular with
companies that are directly affected due to their competition
with Chinese companies that benefit from Chinese export credits
and guarantees.""
 A challenge to Chinese financing could further hurt EU-China
relations, bruised by disagreement over currency and human
rights, at a time when China has offered support for indebted
European countries such as Greece and Portugal.
 It could also make it harder for European firms to do
business in China.
 The EU vowed to hunt down any illegal Chinese practices in a
trade agenda unveiled late last year.
 ""As we have said, we will look more closely at these
things,"" said an EU official when asked about the
correspondence.
 
 UNDERBIDDING 
 EU trade spokesman John Clancy said: ""The Commission and EU
member states are very concerned by the increased amount of
cases where EU Export Credit Agencies ... cannot match the
credit terms of countries that are not bound by (export credit
rules), such as China.
 ""We are raising this issue in our high-level dialogues to the
highest level,"" he added. He declined to comment on the emails.
 Industry data gathered by the EU Commission last year showed
Chinese firms are underbidding EU rivals for big infrastructure
projects, hurting EU energy, telecoms and transport developers,
according to a BusinessEurope email dated Nov. 9, 2010.
 Citing industry data, it blamed low Chinese insurance
premiums, long repayment terms with long grace periods and ""very
favourable -- low or subsidised -- interest rates"".
 Such cheap loans have cut European firms out of lucrative
contracts across Africa, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, Russia
and Latin America, the email said.
 The EU is bound by rules on export credits under an OECD
agreement that China has not ratified.
 The only way to challenge such credits would be to prove
they are being granted at below market rates, which would turn
them into export subsidies forbidden by the World Trade
Organization.
 ""We are aware of a number of concerns in that area, notably
as China is not bound by OECD guidelines on export credits,""
said a spokesman for BusinessEurope.
 He declined to comment on the content of the emails.
 Separately, the Commission is testing EU industry support
for lodging a legal case at the WTO against China over possible
subsidies for the production of environmental goods and
technologies.
 The United States last month took first steps to lodge such
a case, asking for formal talks with China at the WTO.
 EU firms were given until Dec. 10 to file evidence that
Chinese trade and finance practices are hurting profits, and the
Commission is assessing the data, an EU official said.

 * Van Rompuy stresses euro zone commitment to stability
 
 (Adds quotes, background)
 By Adrian Croft
 LONDON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - China was following a good policy
by diversifying into euro assets but may also be helping its
trade position by driving up the value of the euro, European
Council President Herman van Rompuy said on Thursday.
 Recent Chinese pledges to buy Spanish and Portuguese bonds
have helped shore up debt markets in the euro zone periphery as
well as the single currency.
 ""I think it is a good policy to diversify their investments,
not only putting them in the ... U.S. dollar, but also the
euro,"" van Rompuy said in London, where he held talks with
British Prime Minister David Cameron.
 ""They (China) invested even in some weak countries, so they
are very confident in the solvency of some countries,"" he said.
 There could be ""political afterthoughts"", as well as
economic reasons, for China's investments in the euro area, he
said, answering questions after speaking at an event hosted by
Business for New Europe, a business group.
 There were also ""side effects"" from Chinese purchases of
euro-denominated assets, he said.
 ""Because when we (they) buy euros, the euro becomes stronger
and in the relations with their currency, (China's currency
becomes) a little bit weaker, and that is also not neutral in
regard to their competitive position. But I go no further in
this topic. It could be too delicate,"" he said.
 Van Rompuy appeared to be saying that Chinese purchases of
euro assets drove up the value of the euro, making Chinese
exports more attractive.
 
 U.S. COMPLAINTS
 Washington regularly complains that Beijing keeps its yuan
currency too low, giving it an unfair trade advantage.
 China's Deputy central bank governor Yi Gang, part of a
Chinese delegation that visited Europe this month, said in
London on Wednesday that China was prepared to participate in
any future euro zone stabilisation measures.
 China is keen to diversify its official currency reserves --
now at a record $2.85 trillion -- with the euro the primary
alternative to the dollar, taking an estimated 25 percent, or
about $710 billion.
 Van Rompuy said market players should not underestimate the
European Union's political determination to deal with the euro
zone debt crisis.
 It was ""absurd"" that bond spreads showed a bigger default
risk for some euro zone countries than for emerging markets like
Ukraine or Argentina, he said, adding that euro fundamentals
were sound.
 He declined to say whether he thought the euro zone's debt
crisis fund needed more firepower. ""But you can be sure that if
needed we will do everything that can guarantee that financial
stability,"" he said.
 An EU source said van Rompuy was seeking reassurance in his
talks with Cameron that a proposed new British law calling for a
referendum on future transfers of power to Brussels would not be
used to scupper a European treaty change, essential to setting
up a new euro zone debt-crisis mechanism.
 Asked about this, van Rompuy said the EU's 27 members had
agreed to a limited treaty change. ""We don't interfere at all in
the way that it is ratified in each country,"" he said.
 Van Rompuy said euro zone countries ""can and must develop a
convergence of their economic policies."" If required, euro zone
leaders should meet separately from other EU leaders, he said.

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The euro surged on Thursday,
taking on renewed vigor after better-than-forecast debt
auctions by Spain and Italy, but Wall St dipped after weak
U.S. jobless claims data.
 Energy and precious metals prices could not capitalize on
a weaker greenback, but investors pushed prices higher for
grains in Chicago on food price inflation and supply
concerns.
 Tokyo shares closed at an eight-month high and Shanghai
stocks rose, but European bourses weakened in late trade while
U.S shares were mostly lower. In contrast, MSCI's All-Country
World index <.MIWD00000PUS>, reached a fresh 28-month high
before paring some gains.
 The euro got an extra boost after European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet said the euro-zone economy faces
short-term inflationary pressures. The ECB had earlier left
interest rates unchanged at 1 percent. [ID:nLDE70C0KF]
 Spanish banks provided a pocket of strength in European
stocks following the solid sovereign bond auctions in Spain
and Italy on Thursday. These followed a relatively easy sale
of Portuguese debt on Wednesday.
 Analysts cautioned that the sales represented a very small
percentage of supply from those countries this year.
 ""We remain skeptical overall,"" said Mark McCormick,
currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
""We don't see any strong momentum behind these moves. We think
it's just a short-term move and the euro is going to continue
to suffer for the remainder of the quarter.""
 The euro rose 1.64 percent to $1.3351  on the day,
but is still down 0.21 percent so far this year. Against the
Swiss franc, the euro reached a new 1-month high to trade at
1.2853 francs .
 The dollar fell 0.22 percent against the Japanese yen to
trade at 82.76 . Against a basket of currencies, made up
of its major trading partners, the U.S. dollar fell 1.03
percent <.DXY>.
 STOCKS EBB ON JOBLESS CLAIMS
 A surprisingly large increase in new weekly claims for
U.S. jobless benefits soured the mood in the U.S. stock market
while food and energy costs boosted producer prices in
December.
 The claims rose to 445,000 from 410,000 in the prior week,
the biggest one-week climb in about six months, which
countered expectations for a small drop. [ID:nN13271305]
 In late morning New York trade, stocks were mostly lower.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 8.90 points, or
0.08 percent, to 11,746.54. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index

Spain's IBEX35 <.IBEX> rose 2.54 percent after Madrid sold 3
billion euros of 5-year bonds. Rome sold 6 billion euros of 5-

 European mining shares were among the top decliners as key
base metals prices fell. Copper slipped after two days of
strong gains on worries about waning demand in top metals
consumer China, which is approaching its new year holidays.
 The STOXX Europe 600 Basic Materials index <.SXPP> fell
1.89 percent. London-listed Chilean-based copper mining
company Antofagasta  dropped 2.04 percent.
 In the debt markets, euro-zone interest-rate futures fell
while two-year German bond yields rose to their highest levels
since December as traders raised bets on a future interest-
rate hike after Trichet's hawkish comments on inflation.
 The two-year German Schatz yield rose to a 3-1/2-week high
of 1.114 percent after Trichet said the bank had not
precommitted not to move rates and added that they had hiked
rates in July 2008 as the financial crisis got under way.

 WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama

the White House next week.
 ""There will be discussion on global economic issues, as

 Obama and Hu will meet on Jan. 19.
 Washington wants China to allow its yuan currency to
appreciate against the dollar to help fragile U.S. growth by
spurring exports to the Chinese market. It says this would also
help China calm an economy that Beijing fears is overheating.
 China, the largest creditor to the United States, has in
turn voiced concern about aggressive U.S. government spending
and ultra-loose monetary policy that it says could sap the
dollar and hit its U.S. investments.
 Washington also needs Chinese support in persuading North
Korea to halt its nuclear weapons program, and Beijing's

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar for a fourth straight day on Thursday in a rally that
could continue after solid Spanish and Portuguese bond auctions
eased concerns about an escalation of the euro zone debt
crisis.
 The euro jumped more than 1 percent to trade well above
$1.33 as the single currency's rebound prompted many market
players to cover short positions to avoid further losses.
 Comments from European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet that the euro zone faces short-term inflationary
pressures helped raised expectations of interest rate hikes and
further supported the euro.
 Strong demand at the Spanish auction, one day after a solid
Portuguese debt sale, helped ease pressure on peripheral bond
markets. Analysts cautioned, however, that the sales
represented a very small percentage of supply from those
countries this year.
 ""We remain skeptical overall,"" said Mark McCormick,
currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. ""We
don't see any strong momentum behind these moves. We think it's
just a short-term move and the euro is going to continue to
suffer for the remainder of the quarter.""
 The euro climbed as high as $1.3326 on trading platform
EBS, well above the day's low at $1.3088. It last traded up 1
percent at $1.3274.
 Traders cited steady buying from Asian central banks and
demand from momentum players, options players and investment
funds.
 The euro climbed to a one-month high of 1.2837 Swiss francs
ahead of an emergency meeting of Swiss unions and industry
representatives, with the subject expected to be the
record-strong Swiss currency.
 Analysts said the euro may see some support on speculation
that a solution to the debt crisis may come soon. Top European
Union officials are pushing for the bloc to increase the size
and scope of the 440 billion euro ($574 billion) rescue fund.
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Wednesday
that euro zone countries are working on a ""comprehensive
package"", which may be agreed by February or March, to solve
the crisis.
 ""We're wary of positioning for euro downside too
aggressively because there seems to be more news that Germany
and France are going to push through some emergency resolution
package,"" said Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at UBS.
 But others argue the euro remains vulnerable to selling if
debt problems resurface.
 ""In the medium term there are still concerns about the
policy and political perspective regarding how their debt
situations will be resolved, and I don't think anything has
changed because of these auctions,"" said Raghav Subbarao,
currency strategist at Barclays Capital.
 He argued that Portugal's snowballing debt-financing costs
will ultimately force Lisbon to ask for a bailout, while Spain
faces a hefty rollover of existing debt in April. Still, a
bailout for Madrid was unlikely, Subbarao added.
 The dollar fell 0.2 percent to 82.80 yen after data showing
a jump in U.S. jobless claims to their highest level since
October dented optimism about the U.S. economy.
 ""I'd say the data was considerably worse than the recent
run of economic news we've had. It comes at a time when the
dollar was already under some pressure overnight, and it's
exacerbated some of those losses for the greenback,"" said Omer

 By Vladimir Soldatkin
 MOSCOW, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Russia hopes to reach an oil
price deal with Belarus this week that will enable it to resume
crude oil flows to its western neighbour and end a dispute that
has threatened to disrupt pipeline supplies to Europe.
 ""I think that by the end of the week the talks will be
completed, prices agreed, and by Monday or Tuesday oil shipments
to Belarus will take place,"" Nikolai Tokarev, head of Russian
oil pipeline monopoly Transneft, said on Thursday.
 Russian oil flows to Belarus' refineries, which have a daily
capacity of 360,000 barrels, have been halted since Jan. 1 while
price talks continue with Russian oil companies.
 Transit flows to European refiners via the Belarussian
section of the ""Druzhba"" (Friendship) pipeline network, which
typically run at 40 million tonnes a year (800,000 barrels per
day), have so far been unaffected.
 Tokarev told reporters that intense talks were under way
over pricing and that alternate routes were available in case no
agreement can be reached and transit flows are threatened. 
 Moscow has considered using supply routes that would bypass
Belarus should it be necessary, including Primorsk on the
Baltic, Novorossiisk on the Black Sea and the Polish port of
Gdansk. But he added that ""such a scenario is very unlikely"".
 Separately, Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko told reporters
that Russia could resume oil supplies to its ex-Soviet neighbour
and customs union partner within a week.
 Tokarev said that Russia had been scheduled to deliver 1.5
million tonnes of oil to Belarus in January.
 ""We will not supply around half of that due to the supply
cuts,"" he said.
 Traders told Reuters that exports of Russia's Urals export
blend crude would increase during the Belarus oil row.
 
 PAST DISRUPTIONS
 Rows over prices and transit tariffs between Moscow and the
former Soviet states of Belarus and Ukraine have led to Russian
oil and gas supply stoppages to Europe in the past.
 Preferential prices for Russian oil and gas are crucial for
President Alexander Lukashenko's efforts to keep Belarus's
ailing economy afloat.
 He has trimmed closer to Moscow since his election for a
fourth term last month. European leaders strongly criticised the
conduct of the election, which was accompanied by a crackdown on
opposition protests and the jailing of several rival candidates.
 With Russia and Belarus forming a customs union together
with Kazakhstan from Jan. 1, Minsk no longer has to pay Russian
oil tariffs. But traders say Russian firms have halted supplies
in an attempt to get Belarus to pay higher oil prices.
 ""This conflict doesn't make relations between Lukashenko and
the Kremlin any better,"" said Igor Kurinnyy, analyst with ING in
London. ""There are potential risks for Russian oil supply to
Europe.""
 Transneft is accelerating construction of a new pipeline
system, called BTS-2, that would skirt Belarus and boost its
export capacity via the Baltic.
 The route was initially scheduled for completion in the
third quarter of 2012, but could now be finished by the end of
this year.
 ""This will give Russia and upper hand and will strengthen
its position in talks with Belarus,"" said Maxim Moshkov from UBS
investment bank.

(Adds details, background, byline)
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Trading powers must get down to
real negotiations right away if there is to be any hope of
concluding the long-running Doha talks to open up global
commerce this year, a top U.S. negotiator said on Thursday.
 To reach a deal, said the U.S. ambassador to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) Michael Punke, big emerging countries like
China, Brazil and India should accept that their booming
economies meant they must open up their markets more.
 WTO members have drawn up a programme of intensive talks for
the next few weeks, after leaders of the G20 rich and emerging
economies called for the Doha round to be finished and said 2011
was a window of opportunity.
 Economists say a Doha agreement could boost the world
economy by hundreds of billions of dollars. But the
nine-year-old talks have repeatedly missed deadlines and many
negotiators are sceptical a deal is possible now as countries
are wary of opening up their markets if that endangers jobs.
 Punke said the complex negotiations would require so much
detailed work that a deal could not be done unless the real give
and take of bargaining over substantive issues starts now.
 ""For 2011 to be a window of opportunity we have to all be
negotiating effective immediately. That's the logistical reality
of the Doha negotiations,"" he told a briefing. 
 ""There's an awful lot of work to be done.""
 
 DISAPPOINTING CONTACTS
 Talks next week on agriculture and industrial goods -- the
core issues in the Doha talks -- would show whether Washington's
partners were really willing to deal, he said.
 A meeting of key trade ministers at the World Economic Forum
in the Swiss resort of Davos at the end of this month would not
yield a substantive breakthrough but would allow countries to
signal whether they were serious about the talks, he said.
 Punke said recent contacts with China had been disappointing
as they had not gone into the detailed negotiations the United
States had looked for.
 The United States had given China a detailed list of
products where it was seeking better access, but at talks in
Washington in December China did not respond, he said.
 However, it was encouraging that Commerce Minister Chen
Deming indicated to U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk that it
would consider sectoral deals -- a long-standing U.S. demand.
 In sectoral deals, groups of participating countries would
go beyond any overall tariff cuts agreed by the WTO's 153
members to eliminate duties in certain industrial sectors.
 Washington believes such deals, for instance in chemicals,
are essential to open up world trade, but emerging countries
have reservations. 
 Punke said China was now the world's second biggest producer
of chemicals and fifth biggest exporter, and the United States
wanted the same access in China for its chemicals manufacturers
as Chinese companies already enjoyed on the U.S. market.
 He urged Brazil to sign up to the existing information
technology agreement, which eliminates tariffs on some high-tech
products and which many developing countries take part in.
 Recent tariff increases by Brazil were a ""stick in the eye""
for its trading partners and made the Doha talks harder, while
India was sending mixed signals, he said.
 Punke said the United States accepted it would have to make
further concessions in negotiations but the central question was
whether the emerging economies were ready to do more.
 ""If they're prepared to accept that responsibility we'll
have a successful outcome,"" he said. ""If they're not prepared to
accept that responsibility, we won't.""

 By Dagmara Leszkowicz
 WARSAW, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Poland booked more than 1 billion
euros in bids in the reopening of a 10-year euro-denominated
bond on Thursday, setting spreads at 30 basis points higher than
the original issue, Thomson Reuters market unit IFR reported.
 The issue was the first test of appetite for emerging
European Eurobonds in the new year and follows successful debt
placements by southern euro zone members Portugal, Spain, Italy
and Slovenia this week.
 The benchmark-sized issue is a tap of a 1 billion euro bond
issued at 120 basis points above mid-swaps in September.
 Guidance for the tap was set at 150 basis points above
mid-swaps, the lower end of an intial 150-155 range, IFR
reported, citing a lead manager. 
 The lead said over 1 billion in bids had been locked in and
books would close at 1400 GMT. Final pricing would be later on
Thursday, it said. The bond was trading at a yield of 94 bps
over 10-year German bunds.
 Bond yields have risen across Europe in the new year on
renewed worry over the financial health of countries in the euro
zone periphery and rising expectations that central banks,
including Poland's, will raise interest rates.
 ""The spread is wider by some 30 basis points compared to the
previous tender, but the current external environment is much
more difficult now,"" said one Warsaw-based dealer. 
 The dealer said the ministry may have tried to issue the
debt so early in the year because it fears the euro zone's
problems could deteriorate and drive up Polish borrowing costs. 
 Poland's zloty is also around 3 percent stronger against the
euro this year and policymakers believe it may strengthen
further -- making funds gained in euros later in the year worth
less to the government.
 ""We also need to remember that the ministry wants to ensure
its financing at the start of the year and probably expects
quick strengthening of the zloty that could potentially harm the
amount of the issuance,"" the dealer said.
 Deutsche Bank,, UniCredit, ING and Societe Generale lead
managed the deal.
 
 DEMAND FOR EURO DEBT
 The bond follows forays into the market by euro zone
countries this week that have drawn strong demand. Eastern
European Euro zone member Slovenia sold a 10-year, 1.5 billion
euro bond on Monday that was oversubscribed. Last year Poland
issued 5.25 billion euros of euro-denominated bonds, $1.5
billion of dollar-denominated bonds and 625 million in Swiss
franc bonds.
 The country is rated A2 by rating agency Moody's and A- by
Standard & Poor's and Fitch.
 In December Deputy Finance Minister Dominik Radziwill told
Reuters the ministry also plans to issue Swiss franc- and
dollar- denominated bonds and is considering yen-denominated
bond issuance this year, though he gave no details.
 Poland's borrowing needs are estimated at around 167 billion
zlotys ($56.70 billion) this year, some 26 billion zlotys less
than the figure planned for last year.

395,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2011 08:40AM ET</span>",U.S. November trade deficit dips to $38.3 bln," WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit
narrowed unexpectedly in November as exports climbed to the
highest level in more than two years, government data showed on
Thursday.
 The trade gap dipped to $38.3 billion from $38.4 billion in
October, the Commerce Department reported. Analysts surveyed
before the report had expected the November trade deficit to
widen slightly to $40.5 billion from October's originally
reported $38.7 billion.
 November's deficit was the lowest since January 2010.
 November's exports of goods and services totaled $159.6
billion, the highest since August 2008, which was just weeks
before the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers touched off a
trade-crushing global panic.
 November exports to China, at $9.5 billion, were the
highest on record. Despite the export gain, the politically
sensitive trade gap with China widened to $25.6 billion in
November from $25.5 billion in October. Imports from China rose
to $35.1 billion, from $34.8 billion a month earlier.
 These figures will probably feature prominently in the
run-up to next week's U.S.-China leaders summit at the White
House. The United States wants China to allow its yuan currency
to rise more rapidly in order to help shrink the trade gap.

 * Support seen from speculation of euro zone debt measures
 * ECB, BOE keep rates unchanged

(Updates prices, reaction to ECB, BOE rate decision)
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The euro climbed against the
dollar on Thursday after a successful Spanish bond auction eased
some of the concern over the debt problems plaguing the euro
zone's most-indebted countries. 
 The single currency also hit a one-month high against the
Swiss franc as investors pared bearish bets on speculation that
measures to tame the euro zone debt crisis may be on their way.
 Traders said jitters before an upcoming emergency meeting of
Swiss unions and industry representatives triggered selling in
the Swiss franc against the euro, pushing the euro to 1.2837
francs, its highest since mid-December.
 Investors had gone long on the Swiss franc and sold the euro
in December, driving the franc to a record high. Traders said
some of those long positions on the Swiss franc were being cut.
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Wednesday
that euro zone countries are working on a ""comprehensive
package"", which may be agreed by February or March, to solve the
bloc's debt crisis.
 Strong demand at the Spanish auction, which came on the
heels of a solid sale of Portuguese debt on Wednesday, also
bolstered the euro, but some analysts said gains may be limited.

 ""Both the Portuguese and the Spanish auctions were concerns
at the beginning of the week and both seem to have gone off
reasonably well,"" said Raghav Subbarao, currency strategist at
Barclays Capital.
 ""But in the medium term there are still concerns about the
policy and political perspective regarding how their debt
situations will be resolved, and I don't think anything has
changed because of these auctions.""
 He argued that Portugal's snowballing debt-financing costs
will ultimately force the country into asking for an EU/IMF
bailout, while Spain faces a hefty rollover of existing debt in
April. Still, a bailout for Madrid was unlikely, Subbarao added.
The euro was up 0.4 percent on the day at $1.3187, helped by
steady buying by Asian central banks and well above the day's
low to $1.3089. This was the second straight day the euro was on
track for gains, recovering from a fall to around $1.2860 on
Monday, its weakest since mid-September.
 
 EURO SUPPORT?
 It retained those gains after the European Central Bank kept
rates unchanged. President Jean-Claude Trichet will speak to
reporters at 1330 GMT and markets will focus on the central
bank's bond-buying programme and its reaction to higher
inflation..
 Analysts said the euro may see some support on speculation
that a concrete solution to the debt crisis may come soon. Top
European Union officials are pushing for the bloc to increase
the size and scope of the 440 billion euro ($574 billion) rescue
fund it agreed to put in place after bailing out Greece in May.
 ""We're wary of positioning for euro downside too
aggressively because there seems to be more news that Germany
and France are going to push through some emergency resolution
package,"" said Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at UBS.
 Still, others argue the euro remains vulnerable to selling
if debt problems resurface.
 Support for the euro kept the dollar weak. The dollar index,
which tracks the greenback's performance against a basket of
major currencies, was down 0.2 percent at 79.88.
 The dollar moved sideways against the yen at 82.98 yen,
holding within the previous session's trading range.
 The Bank of England kept rates at a record low of 0.5
percent but rising inflationary pressures and higher UK yields
have prompted money markets to price in a strong chance of a
rate hike as early as May. As a result, sterling hit a one-month
high of $1.5793 versus the dollar.

397,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2011 08:16AM ET</span>",Real Doha trade talks must start now -U.S.," * U.S. says now or never for Doha trade talks
 * Seeks moves from China, India, Brazil
 GENEVA, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Trading powers must get down to
real negotiations right away if there is to be any hope of
concluding the long-running Doha talks to open up global
commerce this year, a top U.S. negotiator said on Thursday.
 To reach a deal, said the U.S. ambassador to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) Michael Punke, big emerging countries like
China, Brazil and India should accept that their booming
economies meant they must open up their markets more.
 WTO members have drawn up a programme of intensive talks for
the next few weeks, after leaders of the G20 rich and emerging
economies called for the Doha round to be finished and said 2011
was a window of opportunity.
 Punke said the complex negotiations would require so much
detailed work that a deal could not be done unless the real give
and take of bargaining over substantive issues starts now.
 ""For 2011 to be a window of opportunity we have to all be
negotiating effective immediately. That's the logistical reality
of the Doha negotiations,"" he told a briefing. 
 ""There's an awful lot of work to be done.""
 Talks next week on agriculture and industrial goods -- the
core issues in the Doha talks launched nine years ago -- would
show whether Washington's partners were really willing to deal,
he said.
 A meeting of key ministers at the World Economic Forum in
the Swiss resort of Davos at the end of this month would not
yield a substantive breakthrough but would allow countries to
signal whether they were serious about the talks, he said.
Punke said recent contacts with China had been disappointing
as they had not gone into the detailed negotiations the United
States had looked for, while India was sending mixed signals.
 Recent tariff increases by Brazil were a ""stick in the eye""
for its trading partners and made the Doha talks harder.
 Punke said the United States accepted it would have to make
further concessions in negotiations but the central question was
whether the emerging economies were ready to accept the role
that he said came with their position in the global economy.
 ""If they're prepared to accept that responsibility we'll
have a successful outcome,"" he said. ""If they're not prepared to
accept that responsibility, we won't.""

 By Kirsten Donovan 
 LONDON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - High-yielding euro zone sovereign
bonds outperformed on Thursday after Spain and Italy sold a
combined 9 billion euros of debt, with trading underpinned by
hopes that policymakers may soon shore up the region's fiscal
defences.
 Although borrowing costs rose for both countries, the
successful auctions further improved sentiment towards the
peripheral issuers a day after a Portuguese sale took the edge
off worries over indebted countries' ability to raise funds.
 ""The market may enjoy a short breather after the first round
of non-core euro zone government bond supply is off the table
with maximum amounts sold without major hiccups,"" said
Commerzbank rate strategist David Schnautz. 
 Spain sold 3 billion euros of five-year bonds but while
yields were lower than expected they were still almost a full
percentage point higher than a previous sale in November.
 Italy, sold 6 billion euros of 5- and 15-year government
bonds.
 Yield spreads for Spanish and Italian bonds against their
German benchmarks fell on Thursday.
 But stress levels remain high with the market still taking
the view that Portugal will eventually have to ask for financial
assistance as it faces over 5 billion euros of coupon and
redemption payments in April and a further 7 billion euros'
worth in June.

 'EXCESS OF PESSIMISM'
 Against that backdrop, the European Central Bank meets and
is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at 1.0 percent,
leaving the focus on its bond buying programme and an
acceleration in euro zone inflation.
 ""Are we at the end of the road in terms of solving Europe's
problems? Far from it,"" said Nomura rate strategist Sean
Maloney.
 ""There's been a few things this week that have helped
sentiment but it's more about the excess of pessimism that had
built up rather than there being any positive scenarios here."" 
 Traders cited heavy ECB buying of Portuguese, Greek and
Irish bonds this week as the main factor that helped halt the
rise in bond yields. The Greek 10-year spread over Bunds has
shrunk by around 150 basis points this week, which ICAP says is
the most since last March.
 Portugal met better-than-expected demand on Wednesday,
selling 1.25 billion euros of 5- and 10-year bonds. The
mid-yield on the 10-year bond on Thursday was 6.71 percent, in
line with the average yield at auction, while the five-year
paper yielded 5.36 percent, compared with 5.396 percent.
 March Bund futures were 18 ticks higher at 124.87. Two-year
bond yields were almost a basis point lower at 0.981 percent,
with 10-year yields down 2.2 basis point at 3.031 percent.
 ""I don't think we're going to get any radical change in
prices before the ECB later today, but it's all about whether
yesterday's themes of a bigger rescue package and extended
bailouts continue,"" said a trader.
 Bunds fell on Wednesday, stung by calls from the European
Commission for an increase in the emergency lending capacity of
the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF) in a bid to calm
the sovereign debt markets.
 ""There's very little client flow, it's all being driven by
dealers and it looks they got a bit over-short yesterday and are
covering positions,"" said the trader.
 After a recent pick-up in euro zone inflation, analysts
expect ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet to sound slightly more
hawkish than previously and to face a barrage of questions on
the bank's bond buying programme.
 ""The latest disappointing Euroland inflation data may lead
to a hardening of rhetoric from ECB president Trichet
particularly given continued signs of recovery,"" said RIA
Capital rate strategist Nick Stamenkovic.

 * South Korea to cut some import tariffs to ease inflation
 * India may ban wheat product exports, report says
 
 By Niu Shuping, Tom Miles and Kim Yeonhee
 BEIJING/SEOUL, Jan 13 (Reuters) - China dumped plans to
import several million tonnes of expensive corn and South Korea
unveiled cuts in import tariffs on some products, underscoring
the dilemma over how to tackle rising food prices.
 In India, where vegetable prices have risen more than 70
percent in the past year, the government said it would review
the import and export of essential commodities, adding state run
firms would intensify purchases of some basics.
 A rally in grains prices after a U.S. report on Wednesday
warned of dwindling global supplies suggested further price
pressures may be in the pipeline, just as Sudan saw rare public
protests against cuts in sugar and petroleum product subsidies.
 Governments around the world have been taking measures to
tackle soaring grain prices and head off social unrest, with
north African countries Libya, Algeria and Morocco either
cutting taxes on foods or regulating prices and stepping up
supplies.
 The Philippines on Thursday said it would suspend import
duties on wheat and cement imports.
 World food prices hit a record high in December after
adverse weather affected crops, the United Nations' food agency
said in a report last week that raised concerns about inflation,
protectionism and social unrest -- factors that contributed to
the 2008 food crisis.
 
 OIL MENACING
 While most analysts doubt the world is heading for a crisis
similar to 2008, when food prices spiked to fire up inflation
and sparked violent protests in countries including Egypt,
Cameroon and Haiti, a rise in oil prices also looks menacing.
 Egypt, which imports around half of the food eaten by its 79
million population and is struggling with double-digit food
inflation, will not face similar scenarios of riots in Algeria
and Tunisia, Egyptian trade minister told local media.
 ""The government is committed to subisidising food
commodities, and we are looking for additional resources to face
rising prices,"" a newspaper quoted Rachid as saying.
 London Brent crude at close to $100 a barrel is trading at
its highest price since 2008, when oil hit record highs and
contributed to the inflation spike.
 Wheat prices rose 47 percent last year, corn more than 50
percent and U.S. soybeans by 34 percent. The U.N. Food and
Agricultural Organization (FAO) said in its report key grains
prices could rise further, a view underlined by a U.S. report
published on Wednesday.
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture report reduced estimates
for U.S. corn and soybean harvests, trimmed its corn and soy
output forecast for drought-hit Argentina and cuts its outlook
for wheat production in flood-hit Australia.
 The report sent grains prices soaring and the rally
continued in Asia on Thursday.
 The rise in food prices so far has led to differing
responses from governments, pointing to the difficulty of how to
handle the issue.
 For China, corn prices are just too high, so it has canned a
proposal to import millions of tonnes of the grain, two industry
sources with knowledge of the plan said on Thursday.
 The initial Chinese proposal had been drawn up as a way to
combat food inflation, a worry for Beijing because China's food
inflation is running in double digits.
 It has drawn down state food stocks to increase domestic
supplies and keep a lid on prices, a measure that had also
raised expectations in world food markets of increased Chinese
demand.
 China was a major factor behind the 2010 rally in corn
prices after it imported about 1.5 million tonnes from the
United States to mark its first major purchase in 15 years.
 The country's rising currency is also fuelling expectations
in commodity markets of higher import demand.
 
 KOREA 
 South Korea, on the other hand, unveiled measures on
Thursday to try to calm prices by reducing import tariffs on
some items, including fish and powdered milk.
 The cabinet held an emergency meeting on Wednesday over the
widening spread of foot and mouth disease in cattle that has
raised pork and beef prices.
 The central bank also raised interest rates on Thursday to
combat what it said was a growing inflation threat, following a
rate rise in Thailand on Wednesday, and the government froze
electricity and rail fares.
 In another response, Pakistan signed deals to sell surplus
wheat stocks for the first time in three years to take advantage
of higher prices.
 India also promised to announce anti-inflation measures,
which local media said would include a ban on wheat product
exports and trading in some commodities.
 Data earlier showed that India's food inflation pulled back
slightly from a year high of more than 18 percent to just below
17 percent.
 India's main price measure, the wholesale price index,
showed inflation at 7.48 percent in November, which analysts
said would prompt the central bank this month to raise interest
rates.
 In a hint at new disruption to supplies Argentine farmers
said on Wednesday they would halt grain sales next week to
protest against government curbs on wheat and corn exports,
reviving a conflict that helped push global prices to record
highs in 2008.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The euro hit a one-month high
against the Swiss franc and edged up versus the dollar on
Thursday as speculation that measures to tame the euro zone debt
crisis may be on their way prompted short covering.
 The euro briefly nudged up to the day's high versus the
dollar after strong demand at a Spanish government bond auction
cooled speculation that debt problems plaguing Greece, Ireland
and Portugal will spread to Madrid and beyond.
 Traders said jitters before an upcoming emergency meeting of
Swiss unions and industry representatives triggered selling in
the Swiss franc against the euro, pushing the euro to 1.2837
francs, its highest since mid-December.
 The euro was supported after German Finance Minister

The euro was flat on the day at $1.3150, after edging up to
a session high of $1.3171 after the Spanish auction results. It
recovered from an early slide to $1.3089.
 Hovering around $1.3152, the 50 percent retracement of the
recent fall from around $1.3435 to $1.2870, the single currency
was also supported by its 200-day moving average of $1.3070
after it rose as high as $1.3145 on Wednesday. 
 The euro has recovered from a fall to around $1.2860 on
Monday, its weakest since mid-September.

405,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2011 06:00AM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-China expands yuan's role to overseas investment," * Yuan direct investment to be run as pilot programme	
 * Follows extremely successful yuan-denominated trade reform	
 * Investment scope more limited, but likely to be welcomed	
 
 (adds quotes, details)	
 By Zhou Xin and Simon Rabinovitch	
 BEIJING, Jan 13 (Reuters) - China will allow its companies
to make overseas investments in yuan, the central bank said on
Thursday, another key step in expanding the currency's role in
the global economy.	
 In new rules published on its website, the People's Bank
of China said that domestic firms would be allowed to use yuan
internationally for launching new businesses as well as for
mergers and acquisitions.	
 The scope of the programme, described as a pilot, will be
limited, but the enthusiasm of both Chinese investors and
foreign targets for the currency should not be underestimated,
economists said.	
 ""It will be more convenient for corporates to invest
overseas in terms of the administrative process,"" said
Dongming Xie, China economist at OCBC Bank in Singapore.	
 ""I think capital importers would like to receive yuan.
This will also help boost the yuan pool overseas.""	
 
 The go-ahead for yuan-denominated investment comes on the
heels of a similar experiment launched in the northwestern
province of Xinjiang late last year and follows a decision to
allow importers and exporters to pay for trade in yuan in 2009.	
 Also begun as a pilot programme, trade settlement in yuan
has grown dramatically. From nothing a year ago, nearly 5
percent of Chinese trade is now settled in yuan and the pool
of yuan abroad, particularly in Hong Kong, has increased
exponentially as a result.	
 In terms of scale, the potential for the yuan-denominated
investment programme is far smaller.	
 While China imported goods worth $1.4 trillion last year,
its outbound direct investment only totalled $47.6 billion.
According to the commerce ministry, the top recipients of
Chinese investment were Hong Kong, Cayman Islands and Australia.	
 
 YUAN GOES GLOBAL	
 ""It is a positive step towards improving the yuan's global
status,"" said Gao Shanwen, chief economist at Essence
Securities in Beijing.	
 ""But we need to keep a sober mind about the yuan. It is
still far away from becoming a global reserve currency. After 
all, it is still strictly controlled under the capital account.""	
 The Chinese central bank said the investment programme was
intended to encourage domestic firms to venture abroad and to
promote the yuan's use in international trade and investment.	
 Foreign firms receiving yuan will have a narrow range of
uses for it. They will be able to buy Chinese goods, store it
in low-yielding bank accounts, invest in a small number of
yuan-denominated assets overseas or convert it to other
currencies, primarily through China's central bank.	
 But the limitations on the yuan, whose convertibility
under the capital account is still sharply limited, may not
prove a major obstacle.	
 ""Foreign firms will warmly welcome the move, because the
yuan is the safest currency in the world now,"" said Peng
Junming, chief investment officer at Empire Capital Management
in Beijing. ""The central bank issued the rules at a right time.""	
 For Chinese firms, it could be a double-edged sword.	
 ""It will make it easier for Chinese companies who do not
have sufficient foreign exchange to invest abroad,"" Peng said.
""But it's not necessarily good for them. They will have to
balance investment returns and currency losses.""	
 
 GRADUALISM	
 The yuan has risen nearly 25 percent against the dollar
since a fixed peg to the American currency was broken nearly
six years ago and many market players believe that it could
continue along a path of gradual appreciation for years to come.	
 The yuan's fast-expanding role in overseas trade has
sparked a boomlet in new investment products in Hong Kong.	
 At least 10 asset managers are preparing to launch
yuan-denominated funds there to tap robust overseas demand for
yuan assets amid expectations of faster yuan appreciation and
broader investment channels, two people with direct knowledge
of the matter said this week. [ID:nTOE70C038]	
 At the same time as promoting the yuan's use in trade and
now direct investment, China has moved to cut off speculators
making bets on appreciation.	
 In December, Hong Kong announced that it would limit
banks' net open positions in the Chinese currency to 10
percent of their total yuan-denominated assets or liabilities.	
 Because of the still relatively small amount of yuan held
by individual banks, that could greatly curtail their ability
to offer currency forwards and other derivatives in yuan.

access the pricing information supplied by competitors to
brokers, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) said in a statement on

 * Support seen from speculation of euro zone debt measures
 * Spain sees strong demand at debt auction

 (Releads, updates throughout; previous TOKYO)
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The euro hit a one-month high
against the Swiss franc and edged up versus the dollar on
Thursday as speculation that measures to tame the euro zone debt
crisis may be on their way prompted short covering.
 The euro nudged up to the day's high versus the dollar after
Spain attracted strong demand at an auction of five-year bonds.
Investors had been eyeing the sale to see if debt problems
plaguing Greece, Ireland and Portugal will spread to Madrid and
beyond.
 The single currency added to gains made on Wednesday, when
solid demand at a Portuguese auction quelled some concerns about
the country's snowballing financing costs, prompting a buy back
of euros after it hit a four-month low early this week.
 Meanwhile, traders said jitters before an upcoming emergency
meeting of Swiss unions and industry and trade representatives
triggered selling in the Swiss franc against the euro, pushing
the euro to 1.2837 francs, its highest since mid-December.
 Analysts said the euro was supported after German Finance
Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Wednesday that euro zone
countries are working on a ""comprehensive package"" to solve the
bloc's debt crisis, which could be agreed by February or March.

 ""We're wary of positioning for euro downside too
aggressively because there seems to be more news that Germany
and France are going to push through some emergency resolution
package,"" said Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at UBS.
 ""So the euro could rally going into this.""
The euro rose 0.2 percent on the day at $1.3170, recovering
from an early slide to $1.3089.
 The single currency was supported by its 200-day moving
average of $1.3070 after it rose as high as $1.3145 on
Wednesday. The euro has recovered from a fall to around $1.2860
on Monday, its weakest since mid-September.
 It also poked above $1.3152, the 50 percent retracement of
the recent fall from around $1.3435 to $1.2870.
 Despite the euro's rise this week, market participants say
the euro remains vulnerable to selling if euro zone debt
problems deteriorate further.
 ""At best the euro could rise to around $1.33. But
fundamentally, the euro still has headline risks. Even if
investors' risk appetite grows, they have many other currencies
to buy,"" said Minoru Shioiri, forex manager at Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo.
 ""The euro's downtrend will end only when there is a more
negative story on the dollar,"" he said.
 The European Central Bank announces its monthly policy
decision later in the day, and President Jean-Claude Trichet
will speak to reporters at 1330 GMT. While no policy changes are
expected, focus will be on the central bank's bond-buying
programme and its reaction to higher inflation.
 
 
 SPAIN AUCTION
 Spain's offer of five-year bonds was met with strong demand
even as the paper came with an average yield of 4.542 percent,
higher than 3.576 percent at a previous sale. Expectations had
been for a yield of around 5 percent.
 However, the Spanish results are seen doing little to change
the view that Portugal will continue to struggle and will
ultimately follow Greece and Ireland in seeking aid from the EU
and IMF.
 Support for the euro kept the dollar weak. The dollar index,
which tracks the greenback's performance against a basket of
major currencies, was little changed on the day at 79.98 after
having lost about 1 percent this week.
 The dollar moved sideways against the yen at 82.98 yen,
holding within the previous session's trading range.
 The Aussie was unchanged at $0.9966 after a surprisingly
small rise in employment data, though strong commodity prices
and the currency's high interest rates limited its losses.

 * Euro holds gains
 * Spanish, Italian bond sale demand strong
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - World stocks climbed to a new
28-month high despite weakness in Europe on Thursday while the
euro held on to the previous session's gains as bond auctions in
Spain and Italy went without a hitch.
 Wall Street looked set to open flat.
 The bond auctions followed Wednesday's smooth sale of
Portuguese debt and took the edge off concerns about the ability
of debt-strapped euro zone issuers to fund themselves.
 Spain sold 3 billion euros of five-year bonds
, raising the maximum amount targeted. The yield
was higher than at a previous auction in November but lower than
recent secondary market levels.
 ""It's been successful, the most positive has been reaching
the top end of the objective and the bid-to-cover ratio of 2.1
is higher than the previous auction,"" said Soledad Pellon, an
analyst at IG Markets.
 ""The success is due to national and international support
and has been taken favourably by the markets."" 
 Italy's auction of 7 billion euros of 5- and 15-year
government bonds  also went well, if
anything slightly better than Spain's.
 Recent worries about the sustainability of the euro zone's
debt-strapped economies have eased, partly because a European
Union finance ministers meeting next week is likely to address
new support mechanisms.
 Promises from China and Japan to support Europe through its
fiscal crisis have also helped ease worries about the euro
zone's financing troubles.
 One result has been a rebound in the euro from recent lows.
It hit a one-month high against the Swiss franc on Thursday, for
example, and was close to $1.32 , compared with recent
trading below $1.29.
 ""We're wary of positioning for euro downside too
aggressively because there seems to be more and more news that
Germany and France are going to push through some emergency
resolution package,"" said Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at
UBS.
 The European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged at
1.0 percent as expected.
 
 BUOYANT STOCKS
 Outside Europe, stocks were generally higher, lifted by the
easing euro zone fears, an improving global economy and positive
corporate earnings.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were up 0.4
percent having earlier hit a fresh 28-month high and emerging
market stocks <.MSCIEF> climbed to a 31-month peak.
 This came despite losses in Europe, where the FTSEurofirst
300 <.FTEU3> lost 0.2 percent, in what was likely to be
profit-taking after a run that has given it a 3.5 percent gain
this year.
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed up 0.7 percent, at a new
eight-month high.

 * Looking to get high-tech goods from Europe if not U.S.	
 
 By Kevin Yao and Langi Chiang	
 BEIJING, Jan 13 (Reuters) - China will cast a sceptical
eye over a U.S. offer to free up trade in high-tech goods and
will refuse to be drawn into a bargain to speed up
appreciation of its yuan currency, Chinese government advisers
and economists said on Thursday.	
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Wednesday
that Washington was ""willing to make progress"" in giving China
greater access to the American market and high-tech goods,
provided that it saw some give from Beijing on its tightly
controlled exchange rate regime. [ID:nN12191046]	
 Chinese officials declined to comment on Geithner's idea,
made ahead of Chinese President Hu Jintao's visit next week to
the United States, but a series of advisers and analysts said
that it was unlikely to jump at a trade-for-currency deal.	
 ""China has never thought about yuan appreciation from such
a perspective,"" said Ding Yifan, deputy head of the World
Institute in the Development Research Centre, a think-tank
under the State Council, or cabinet.	
 ""The Chinese yuan will not rise in a way designed by the
United States. Yuan appreciation is a general trend. It is not
because the United States wants it,"" he said.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
 
 The pilfering of U.S. intellectual property is the main
reason for the curbs on exports of high-technology products
that China consistently demands Washington remove.	
 Washington may, in fact, be too slow in opening the door
to American technology, said Tao Xie, an expert on U.S.-China
relations at the Beijing Foreign Studies University.	
 He noted that a parade of top Chinese officials had
visited Western Europe in recent months and appeared to be
making inroads there in gaining access to high-tech goods.	
 ""That means we may not need to make major concessions to
Washington about the currency,"" he said. ""If China can get the
same level of technology and equipment from Western Europe,
why should it bother with the United States?""	
 China has guided the yuan up by 0.4 percent against the
dollar this week, following a well-established pattern of
nudging up the currency's value before important political
meetings. 
 With China's trade surplus hitting nearly $200 billion
last year and inflation running at its fastest in more than
two years, economists believe that more yuan appreciation is
needed over the coming year. 
 ""We know that the government has pledged to put the task
of fighting inflation at the top of its agenda this year,""
said Lu Zhengwei, senior economist at Industrial Bank in
Shanghai.	
 ""As more and more Chinese households own cars, the impact
from higher international crude oil on inflation expectations
has increased sharply. I think this is the most important
factor behind the sharp appreciation in recent days,"" he said.

418,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2011 02:56AM ET</span>",EXCLUSIVE-UPDATE 2-China govt killed plan for big corn imports," * China considered millions of tonnes of corn imports
 * Govt wanted to cool domestic food price inflation 
 * Govt likely killed plan due to high prices, enough supply
 * Follows Argentine claim of plan for 5MT imports in 2011

 (Adds comments, background)
 By Tom Miles, Tracy Zheng and Niu Shuping
 BEIJING, Jan 13 (Reuters) - China decided against a plan to
arrange millions of tonnes of corn imports, two industry sources
with knowledge of the proposal said on Thursday, but many
analysts still expect China will need to import this year.
 Both sources cited China's food-related inflation as the
reason for the initial plan and high foreign corn prices as the
reason for the government to kill the proposal.
 Corn prices rose last year because of strong demand and a
weak 2009 harvest. The government is widely thought to be
relatively low on stocks, which some analysts put at below 10
million tonnes, and is fearful of buying up the latest harvest
lest it trigger fresh price rises.
 One of the sources said the government felt China's
short-term corn supply was not a problem.
 ""Previously, there was such a proposal. But not any more,""
said one of the sources. ""The timing was not appropriate and
(U.S.) prices were high. There's a big price difference with
Chinese corn and Chinese prices do not seem to have risen much
since the government acted to cool them.""
 Rumours of such a bulk purchase have preoccupied the corn
market in recent months as China is widely expected to need to
import again this year, although U.S. prices are currently too
high to make imports into China commercially viable.
 ""I think China doesn't have a choice, when they need to
restock, they will restock,"" said Adam Davis, a senior commodity
analyst at Merricks Capital, a Melbourne-based funds manager
that invests in agriculture.
 ""We have seen series of strong imports throughout Q3 and Q4
last year followed by subdued buying in the last month or so,
and in this quarter we expect to see China back in the market.""
 U.S. prices hit a 30-month high on Wednesday after the U.S.
Department of Agriculture slashed its estimate of U.S. corn
stocks, making U.S. corn imports even less attractive in China.
 ""If they expect prices to be higher tomorrow, they will buy
today,"" said Davis. ""We have often seen China as the catalyst
for higher prices. Indeed the supply situation is tight and they
should be buying at these prices.""
 Argentina's agriculture minister said in November, following
a visit by his Chinese counterpart, that China planned to import
5 million tonnes of corn in 2011. But China's agriculture
ministry denied it had discussed such a plan.
 However, the ministry is not in charge of China's corn
imports, which are overseen by the National Development and
Reform Commission (NDRC). NDRC officials were not immediately
available to comment on Thursday.

 Chinese President Hu Jintao will this month visit Chicago,
where corn and other agricultural futures are traded, but a big
corn purchase is not expected, two Chinese industry sources
said.
 ""The Chicago market could go crazy just because the COFCO
people are visiting, let alone the Chinese president,"" said a
China-based trader at an international grain trading house.
 ""We don't think there will be corn purchases during Hu's
visit. As far as we know none of suppliers have been contacted.
Any large volume of purchases from the United States seem
unrealistic now. Suppliers may not dare to risk being short on
the Chicago market given the tight physical supplies.""
 
 IMPORTS A LAST RESORT
 China imported about 1.5 million tonnes of U.S. corn in
2010, the first major purchase in 15 years, after the poor 2009
harvest failed to satisfy demand from animal feed producers and
corn processors, who manufacture sweetners and food additives.
 But Agriculture Minister Han Changfu has said the harvest
was 10 million tonnes bigger in 2010 than in 2009, strengthening
China's ability to remain self-sufficient and weakening the case
for imports, at least in the short term.
 China sees corn, along with wheat and rice, as strategically
important crops that should not need to be imported.
 But in 2010, the need to supply feed mills and prevent a
price spike trumped the desire for self-sufficiency in grains,
and state grains trader COFCO Ltd was authorised to import corn
under the state quotas for resale to feedmills. The government
wants to close the door again if it can.
 ""China's corn imports can only be opened up gradually, as
corn is more important (than soybean and cotton) to the national
economy and the people's livelihood and the government will aim
to be self-sufficient first, and will only seek to expand
imports when they can't make it,"" said Huang Xiao, a manager
with Capital Futures.
 China's corn reserves may also be low, since the government
has sold off about 49 million tonnes since 2009 and has not yet
bought up any of the 2010 harvest. The plan to fight inflation
by booking bulk imports implies that the shipments would have
gone straight to the market, not stockpiles, although the extra
supply could have freed up China's own crop for government
stockpiling.
 In the longer term, China's grain supply and demand will be
tightly balanced and guaranteeing grain security involves
""severe challenges"", State Administration of Grain chief Nie
Zhenbang said in a statement on Thursday.

 By Jason Subler and Lu Jianxin	
 SHANGHAI, Jan 13 (Reuters) - China's central bank set the
yuan's mid-point above 6.60 per dollar for the first time on
Thursday, breaching an important barrier just days before
Chinese President Hu Jintao travels to Washington.	
 The yuan's rise in the last few days, on the back of
successive record highs in its daily mid-point, reflects a
long-held pattern of Beijing allowing appreciation of the
currency ahead of big political meetings, where it often faces
calls for the yuan to strengthen further.	
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ratcheted up that
pressure on Wednesday, saying China needed to let the yuan
strengthen more quickly, while adding that quicker
appreciation could open up access to U.S. ""dual-use""
technology that is currently restricted for export.	
 While analysts were somewhat sceptical over what might be
achieved on the currency issue during the Jan. 19 summit
between Hu and U.S. President Barack Obama, the yuan's move
beyond 6.6 per dollar is significant.	
 ""The breach of the 6.6 level may not be as exciting an
event as many market players believe, but its significance
must not be underestimated: The central bank has allowed a new
round of yuan appreciation,"" said Liu Dongliang, senior
currency strategist at China Merchants Bank in Shenzhen.	
 ""Recently, the central bank has stated its intention of
strengthening its anti-inflation fight, giving the market
confidence that overall yuan appreciation will be quickened in
2011.""	
 
 
 ON CHINA'S OWN TERMS	
 The People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the tone for a
strong day for the currency by setting the mid-point for daily
trading against the dollar at 6.5997.	
 That marked the first time it had been set stronger than
6.60. The rate set by the central bank is the point from which
the renminbi can rise or fall 0.5 percent on a given day.	
 In spot trading, the yuan rose to around 6.5970
versus the dollar by mid-afternoon, a rise of 3.5 percent
since last June when authorities dropped a peg with the U.S.
dollar that had been set to support the economy during the
global financial crisis. 
 U.S. businesses and officials want China to allow the
currency to rise at a faster pace to help narrow a trade gap,
which Chinese data this week showed had widened in 2010 by 26
percent to $181 billion. [ID:nTOE709033]	
 Geithner reiterated on Wednesday the need for a faster
appreciation of the yuan and added that such a move could lead
to an easing of restrictions on U.S. exports of technology
with both civilian and military use to China.	
 The comments opened up a new angle on discussions over the
yuan as Hu and Obama prepare to meet next week in what is being
billed as the most important state visit in 30 years.	
 But it could be too little too late, and could be viewed
in Beijing as Washington offering something it would
eventually have to concede anyway, some Chinese analysts said.	
 ""China has never thought of the yuan appreciation from
such a perspective,"" said Ding Yifan, deputy head of the World
Institute at the Development Research Centre, a think-tank
under the State Council, China's cabinet.	
 ""The United States has always known that China has to let
the yuan rise. They want to take advantage of this. The
Chinese yuan will not rise in a way designed by the United
States.""	
 
 MEASURED PACE	
 China-based currency traders said they expected the yuan
to continue to gain in the next week or two as Beijing looks
to lay a positive foundation for Hu's talks with Obama, but
that its rise could slow again afterwards.	
 ""It will be a very familiar format, that the yuan jumps
during a major political event and then pulls back,"" said a
senior trader at a North American bank in Shanghai.	
 Onshore traders said the yuan had the potential to rise
around 500 pips by the end of Hu's U.S. visit on Jan. 21, with
a ceiling seen at 6.55 and a floor at 6.60 in the weeks after
the visit.	
 Offshore dollar/yuan forwards initially fell
across most of the curve to imply more yuan appreciation after
Thursday's strong mid-point.	
 The three-month dollar/yuan forward hit a record low, but
then rebounded, supporting the view that the spurt in the yuan
could lose momentum.	
 While the yuan's gains against the dollar have accelerated
since the peg was dropped and especially during the last
month, its value against a trade-weighted basket has stayed
largely stable.	
 By the end of the year though, China is seen allowing the
yuan to rise 5.4 percent to around 6.3 per dollar as part of
its efforts to quell inflation, a Reuters poll of more than 40
economists and strategists showed this week. [ID:nSLABCE7MO]

ministers will discuss reducing the interest rate charged
to the bloc's portion of an 85 billion euro EU/IMF bailout
which Ireland sought late last year, the Irish Times reported
on Thursday.	
 The paper said the discussions could take place as early
as next week when the ministers meet in Brussels on Monday.
Irish opposition politicians have repeatedly criticised as
expensive the 5.8 percent interest rate on the financial
package. 
 ""European officials have expressed caution about the
prospect of an immediate move to cut the interest rate on
Irish loans, saying any reduction in the rate by the European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) could have negative
implications for its triple A credit rating,"" the paper said.	
 A euro zone source said lowering the interest rate was ""at
the discussion stage, not the decision stage"", adding that the
ministers would debate issue as part of a wider discussion on
the Irish bailout and a review of the Greek rescue plan.	
 The paper cited a spokesman for EU Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn as saying he was ""not aware of
such a discussion being scheduled and taking place next week"",
but added the commission did not set the agenda of the euro
group or the ECOFIN council of EU finance ministers.	
 Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said last week the
interest rate for funding from the EU and IMF was determined
by ""a common approach for any borrower"".	
 ""Accordingly, any changes to these rates cannot be
negotiated for Ireland in association and must be seen in the
wider context,"" Lenihan said.	
 The IMF said late last year the next Irish government,
which opinion polls indicate will likely be a coalition of the
cente-right Fine Gael and centre-left Labour parties, would
not be able to renegotiate the IMF interest rate. 
 Ireland was forced to go to the IMF and the EU to deal
with a crisis in its banking sector which brought the former
""Celtic Tiger"" economy to its knees and rattled the wider euro
zone.	
 Under the bailout, the IMF contributed 22.5 billion euros,
another 45 billion euros came from Europe and Ireland will
contribute 17.5 billion euros.

 * Yields up almost 100 basis points, but less than expected
 * Issue well received, calms some periphery debt concerns

(Adds quotes, background)
 By Nigel Davies
 MADRID, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Investors showed appetite for
Spain's debt on Thursday, pushing borrowing costs up less than
expected at its debut debt auction for 2011 and alleviating some
concerns about the euro zone's more vulnerable debtor nations.
 Spain sold 3 billion euros of its five-year bonds, at the
top end of the Treasury's target range but less than the 3.4
billion euros sold at the previous auction on Nov. 4, which had
a higher target. Bids of over 6 billion euros were taken.
 The Treasury paid nearly a full percentage point more to
sell the debt than last time, but much less than a 150 basis
point premium priced in at the start of the week had suggested.
 Minutes later, Italy also sold 6 billion euros of debt,
again at the top end of its target range.
 The successful sales, and a largely well-received auction of
debt by Portugal on Wednesday, helped cool speculation that the
crisis which forced Greece and Ireland to take bailouts last
year will also engulf both Portugal and Spain.
 ""For the near term I expect we will see some decrease in the
pressure on euro zone periphery debt,"" said Luca Cazzulani,
deputy head of fixed income at UniCredit.
 ""But it's one thing to say we are seeing good demand at
auctions ... countries are (still) paying substantially more
than in previous months.""
 Spain paid a yield of 4.542 percent, a big jump up from
3.576 percent at the last auction.
 The euro rose 0.2 percent on the day to $1.3170 after the
Spanish auction, recovering from an early slide to $1.3089, with
traders also citing speculation that fresh measures to tame
the euro zone debt crisis may be in the works.
 ""The market is seeking a turning point in the peripheral
crisis,"" said Peter Chatwell, rates strategist at Credit
Agricole in London.
 
 STRONG INTEREST
 The bid-to-cover ratio on the bond was 2.1, up on the 1.6
level at the Nov. 4 auction, reflecting strong demand. Overseas
investors took about 60 percent of the bonds on offer, a source
told Reuters.
 Last week China said it would continue to buy Spanish bonds
and welcomed austerity measures and structural reforms aimed at
slashing the country's deficit and stimulating a weak economy.
 But traders said foreign demand was not enough to convince
them that the worst of the crisis was over.
 ""We have seen very reasonable demand, but problems are not
resolved and we expect many months of volatility,"" said a
Madrid-based trader.
 The chief executive of Spanish bank Banesto said he did not
expect Spain to end up needing to tap a European Union rescue
fund like Ireland or Greece. Markets still expect that Portugal
will eventually have to ask for financial assistance given a
heavy schedule of debt repayments in the first half of 2011.
 ""Spain is in a radically different situation to those
countries that have already asked for it, or even from another
country that some expect to ask for it in the coming weeks,""
said Banesto boss Jose Garcia Cantera.
 On Thursday the key risk premium on Spanish debt as measured
by the yield on 10-year government bonds versus German bunds was
around 235 basis points, some way off a 6-week high close to 300
bps hit last week.
Spanish bank shares jumped on Wednesday and Thursday on
expectations of a good result at the auction. The banks are
heavily exposed to sovereign debt and many still have trouble
accessing the European interbank market due to concerns over
Madrid's high government deficit.
 Leading bank Santander's shares were up 4.0 percent on
Thursday at 1137 GMT, while Spain's second largest bank BBVA
rose 5.77 percent, after soaring a day earlier.

than development in global GDP,"" Andersen said.	
 Prospects for population growth in developing countries whose people are
becoming wealthier and want to consume things like people in Europe and North
America will create plenty of work for a group like Maersk even though there
will be bumps in the road, Andersen said.	
 ""We should get used to a world where there will be colossal volatility
both in the short and long run, with dramatic upturns and downturns,"" he said
at the annual New Year's dinner of the Danish Society of Financial Analysts.	
 ""But long-term growth -- that we think is entirely given,"" Andersen said.	
 China's huge workforce as well as those of Asian countries with even lower
wage costs than China suggest that outsourcing and offshoring of work will
continue as long as the large cost gap exists, Andersen said.	
 He said factories were likely to continue getting larger, meaning that
more and more components would be transported around the globe before products
are assembled, so container transport would continue growing faster than the
world economy.	
 ""We are a company that has invested heavily in growth,"" Andersen said. ""We
have invested about 200 billion crowns ($35 billion) over the past five years.
That corresponds to about 200 million crowns per work day.""	
 Despite that big investment programme, A.P. Moller-Maersk had a cash flow
from operations of $7.4 billion in the first nine months of 2010, Andersen
noted.	
 ""One does not need to be a great mathematician to calculate that it will
be about $10 billion for the year,"" Andersen said.

 * Spanish and Italian bond sales next major focus
 * Hopes for more policy response to debt woes help euro
 * Aussie soft after disappointing jobs data
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The euro slipped from one-week
highs on Thursday after short-covering triggered by Portugal's
successful debt auction the previous day ran its course and
traders looked to debt sales by Spain and Italy.
 Portugal's fund raising in the bond market sent bears
scrambling to buy back the euro, pushing it above its 200-day
moving average, but many hurdles remain for the currency,
starting with bond sales by Spain and Italy later in the day.
 Some analysts say hopes for further policy responses by the
euro zone to tackle the debt woes are helping the euro amid talk
of increasing rescue funds, but they caution it is too early to
bet that anything substantial will be agreed at a eurogroup
finance ministers meeting early next week.
 ""At best the euro could rise to around $1.33. But
fundamentally, the euro still has headline risks. Even if
investors' risk appetite grows, they have many other currencies
to buy,"" said Minoru Shioiri, manager of forex at Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley Securities.
 ""The euro's downtrend will end only when there is a more
negative story on the dollar,"" he said.
 The euro slipped 0.24 percent on the day to $1.3100, a day
after short-covering drove the currency as high as $1.3145, well
above its 200-day moving average of $1.3070 and Monday's
four-month low around $1.2860.
 Resistance lurks at $1.3152 for euro/dollar, a 50 percent
retracement of the recent fall from around $1.3435 to $1.2870,
while the 200-day moving average will provide support.
 Talk of Japanese investors' buying also helped to push the
euro above 109 yen for the first time in a week. It later slipped
to 108.82 yen but remained above the four-month low of 106.83 yen
hit earlier in the week.
 The currency's gains so far this week have been driven in
part by budding speculation that euro zone policy makers may be
inching closer to step up safety measures for the currency bloc's
troubled countries, said Keiji Matsumoto, a strategist at Nikko
Cordial Securities.
 ""Euro zone policy-makers are moving more pre-emptively these
days. To stop debt crisis contagion to Spain from Portugal, they
really need to enlarge their rescue funds. It seems they are
moving in that direction,"" Matsumoto said.
 The European Commission and euro zone countries are
discussing changes in the size and scope of operations of the
European Financial Stability Facility, Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said.
 A recent show of international support for the currency bloc,
even if symbolic, is also helping to reduce worries, with both
China and Japan providing help.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday a European
Union/International Monetary Fund bailout fund for heavily
indebted euro zone countries was sufficient for now, but that
Germany would be ready to do what was needed to support the euro
-- comments some market players took as a softening of her
opposition to the idea.
 Immediate attention now turns to debt auctions in Spain and
Italy, which will also be watched for signs of contagion.
 Analysts expect the sales to go without a major hitch, but at
elevated costs and there is little change in the view that
Portugal will continue to struggle and will ultimately follow
Greece and Ireland in seeking aid from the EU and IMF.
 ""It remains to be seen whether one strong auction will be
enough to truly assuage fears over euro zone stability, but FX
options data shows many traders may have begun to bet on, and
hedge against, further euro strength,"" said David Rodriguez, a
strategist at DailyFX.
 ""It will be important to watch for similarly robust results
out of the Spanish and Italian debt auctions if the euro is to
continue higher against the safe-haven U.S. dollar.""
 All these developments left the dollar looking lacklustre.
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance
against a basket of major currencies, inched up 0.2 percent on
the day to 80.19 after having lost about 1 percent this week.
 The dollar moved sideways against the yen at 83.08 yen,
holding within the previous session's trading range.
 The Aussie shed 0.2 percent to $0.9940 after a surprisingly
small rise in employment data, though strong commodity prices and
the currency's high interest rates limited its losses.

sales

day

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 HONG KONG, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The euro dipped on Thursday
but could head higher if Spain and Italy, like Portugal, also
find decent demand for their debt, while U.S. oil prices crept
up to $92 a barrel, potentially straining consumers who are
already watching food prices climb. 
 Promises from China and Japan to support Europe through
its fiscal crisis have also helped to keep the euro around
$1.31 and the closeout of small bets against the euro could
push it up above $1.32 in the near term, particularly as
global equity markets hit two-year highs.	
 The euro zone's financing troubles have generally dragged
on investors' appetite for risk taking, though signs that
highly indebted European countries are able to tap capital
markets albeit at high borrowing costs, may put risk seeking
back in play.	
 Japan's Nikkei share average rose 0.7 percent to
an eight-month high, with stocks of large exporters among the
biggest boosts to the index.	
 ""The strong bond auction in Portugal has calmed the
markets and with no major negative factors in sight, foreign
funds continue buying lagging banking and property shares,""
said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi
Investment
Management, in Tokyo.	
 Japanese bank stocks outperformed for a second day as
foreign investors kept loading up on previously underweighted
financials. Shares of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group ,
Japan's biggest bank by assets, gained 1.3 percent.	
 HSBC Holdings was in focus on Thursday
after its London-listed shares climbed 3.8 percent overnight,
the biggest single-day gain since August 2010.	
 The Hong Kong-listed shares of the company were up 1.2
percent and have risen 8.5 percent so far in January on heavy
trading volumes, as investors bet the bank would catch up with
the share price gains of rival Standard Chartered Plc
. 
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan was up
0.6 percent , within striking distance of a
2-1/2-year high that has been tested twice in the past two
months. 
 The materials and financial sectors led gains in the MSCI
index.	
 The MSCI all-country world index edged up to the highest
since Sept. 2, 2008 , having risen 20 percent
since September 2010, when investors began to factor in the
impact of further monetary easing by the Federal Reserve.	
 
 EURO BOUNCE ONLY TEMPORARY?	
 The euro was holding at $1.3100 , down 0.2 percent
on the day but up around 1.8 percent so far on the week.	
 Traders may take a shot at the low from Jan. 3 at $1.3248
in the next few sessions, though that probably depends on how
well Spain's 3 billion euro two-year bond auction and Italy's
combined 7 billion euro debt auctions go.	
 ""We can't help feeling that the bounce in sentiment will
prove temporary and whilst it may continue over the short-term
with attendant upside risks for the euro, it is unlikely to
last for long unless concrete measures are unveiled by the
authorities in Europe,"" Mitul Kotecha, global head of foreign
exchange strategy with Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong, said
in a note. 
 For now, Portugal's successful fund raising in the bond
market, and at a lower cost for its 10-year debt issue, along
with encouraging euro zone industrial production data, helped
put a spring in the step of the common currency.	
 U.S. crude oil prices  edged up 0.1 percent, to
$91.94 a barrel after crude stocks in the world's largest oil
user fell more than expected and a cold weather stoked demand
for heating oil in the U.S. Northeast.	
 Brent crude for February delivery was up 0.2 percent to
$98.35 a barrel , closing in on the milestone of $100.	
 Food inflation remained a global concern, with no apparent
let up in climbing prices.	
 U.S. corn futures  jumped 1.5 percent on Thursday,
while soybeans  rose nearly 1 percent to their highest in
almost 2-1/2 years, buoyed by a surprisingly deep cut in the
U.S. Agriculture Department's forecast for U.S. corn and
soybean stocks.

 LONDON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The Bank of England is set to
keep interest rates at a record low on Thursday despite a
looming spike in inflation, on concerns that a muted economic
recovery will lead to longer-term downward pressure on prices.
 The BoE has given no indications in the last month that it
is considering an imminent rise in interest rates, and none of
the 62 economists polled by Reuters last week expected a change
in policy when January's decision is announced at 1200 GMT.
 Rises in food and utility bills combined with a higher sales
tax are likely to push inflation, which was already running a
full percentage point above the BoE's 2 percent goal throughout
2010, up to 4 percent in the coming months.
 But there is little the BoE can do now to stop this surge,
and a hasty rate hike may only suggest panic on the part of the
central bank, economists say.
 Rather than the short-term run-up in prices, it is a rise in
longer-term inflation expectations among bond investors and the
general public that is likely to be the main new concern for
most of the nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee.
 Futures markets have already priced in a strong chance of a
rise in interest rates from their record low of 0.5 percent as
early as May, in contrast to the economists polled last week who
on average do not expect the BoE to raise rates before October.
 ""For the BoE to tighten in the first half of the year, we'd
need to see signs that inflation expectations are starting to
move out of their recent range and reach levels that are
concerning for the MPC,"" said J.P. Morgan economist Allan Monks.
 For its part, the BoE believes that inflation will fall
below 2 percent early in 2012 once the effect of two successive
rises in VAT drop out of the annual comparisons and the effect
on import prices of sterling's past slide fades.
 It also sees downward risks to economic growth from public
spending cuts that are likely to cost more than 300,000 jobs
over the next 4 years, depressing wages and domestic demand.
 
 REPEAT SPLIT
 January's MPC meeting is probably going to see a repeat of
the three-way policy split that has been in place since October.
 MPC member Adam Posen has called for an increase in total
quantitative easing to 250 billion pounds ($389 billion) from
200 billion pounds, as he sees long-term downward pressure on
inflation from public spending cuts, tight credit and household
indebtedness.
 In contrast, fellow MPC member Andrew Sentance has said
since June that a 25 basis point rise in interest rates now
would reduce the need for a sharper, more economically damaging
rise in rates at a later point in the business cycle.
 Britain's economy rebounded strongly from its sharpest
recession since World War Two during the middle of 2010, but
growth is forecast to be negligible in the first half of 2011
due to spending cuts and the rise in value-added tax.
 Manufacturing exports are booming in a delayed response to
past years' falls in sterling, but many of the service sector
firms that account for the vast bulk of British economic
activity and employment are struggling.
 November industrial output data is published at 0930 GMT,
and the MPC will also have early access to December's producer
prices data, due on Friday, as well as to an initial estimate of
December's inflation figure.
 Nonetheless, the lively policy debate which economists
expect to take place behind closed doors at the BoE is likely to
find only muted expression in the MPC's policy minutes, which
will be published on Jan. 26 and include a voting breakdown.
 Last month the minutes suggested that those MPC members who
voted to keep rates on hold were getting more worried about
rising inflation pressures.
 Rising inflation expectations are likely to be mentioned
more forcefully, and there may be a subtle reference to a
discussion of the merits of pre-emptive rate rises to bolster
public confidence in the BoE's fight against inflation.
 The markets are increasingly pricing in a BoE interest rate
rise by the summer to prevent a full-blown credibility crisis.

 By Ilona Wissenbach
 BERLIN, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Euro zone countries are working
on a ""comprehensive package"" to solve the bloc's debt crisis
which could be agreed by February or March, German Finance
Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Wednesday.
 ""We can't just solve the problems over the short term -- if
there are short-term problems -- but also over the mid term,""
Schaeuble told reporters, adding that euro zone states were
trying to reach agreement on a ""comprehensive package"".
 The Financial Times, citing unnamed people familiar with the
situation in Berlin and Brussels in its Thursday edition, said
Germany was backing proposals to give new powers and lending
capacity to a euro zone rescue fund even if it meant increasing
its financial guarantees.
 Schaeuble did not say whether the package would involve an
increase in the volume of the rescue fund set up in May to
protect the single currency, although the European Commission
has been pressing for this.
 He said he did not expect an agreement on the package at
Monday's meeting of euro zone finance ministers, but said a deal
could be reached at one of the upcoming European Union summits
in February or March.
 Germany had already held discussions about the package with
France, Italy and International Monetary Fund Managing Director
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Schaeuble said.
 Angela Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert said the German
chancellor had met Strauss-Kahn in Berlin on Wednesday.
 ""No decisions were made about future measures,"" he said.
 Schaeuble also noted that Portugal's successful debt auction
on Wednesday was a positive bit of news for the bloc.
 ""It's an encouraging sign that the Portuguese bonds were
sold better than many people had feared,"" he said.
 Portugal is seen as the next euro zone candidate that will
need a bailout but passed a key market test on Wednesday selling
a benchmark 10-year bond at a lower yield than in the previous
auction and drawing strong demand.

 NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Global stocks and the euro
rallied on Wednesday after healthy demand for Portugal's bond
sale eased concern over the debt crisis in Europe, while a
surge in corn and soybean futures powered a broad rally in
commodity prices.
 European stocks hit a 28-month closing high, lifted by
speculation the European Union will bolster the region's rescue
fund, and government bond prices dropped after the Portuguese
bond auction reduced investors' appetite for safety.
 U.S. stocks also surged on the improved sentiment over
Europe's debt crisis and on a brighter outlook for U.S. banks
after a Wells Fargo upgrade for the sector and on comments that
JPMorgan Chase & Co  could soon pay an annual dividend.
For details see: [ID:nN11151339]
 ""It's a bit of relief from the fear that was running
really high some days ago. There was talk that Portugal could
be asking for help very soon,"" said Klaus Wiener, chief
economist at Generali Investments in Cologne, Germany.
 ""Equity markets are rising because we have a fairly decent
global macroeconomic backdrop. The fast-growing regions are
still powering ahead and we see growth accelerating in the U.S.
as well,"" he added.
 The euro jumped more than 1 percent to a session high of
$1.3144 and broke above its 200-day moving average of $1.3071
on trading platform EBS. For details see [ID:nN12148673]
 Still, the euro's gains could be short-lived as analysts
believe the government in Lisbon will continue to struggle and
still may turn to the EU and International Monetary Fund for a
bailout.
 ""Markets are far from convinced that the crisis has begun,
let alone ended,"" said Alan Wilde, head of fixed-income and
currency at Baring Asset Management in London, which oversees
$50 billion in assets.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI's all-country world index

<0#NK:> up 35 points at 10,620.
 COMMODITY-RELATED SHARES RISE
 U.S. stocks rose on signs of strength in the U.S. banking
sector, improved sentiment due to the Portuguese bond sale and
a rise in commodity-related shares as soybean and corn futures
hit 30-month highs.
 A U.S. government report said that American stockpiles of
corn and soybeans would be drawn down to surprisingly low
levels. [ID:nN12190436]
 Soybean  and corn  futures jumped 4 percent each

 Earlier in Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of
the region's top shares rose 1.5 percent to its highest close
since September 2008, with Spanish banks leading.
 The S&P is almost 9 percent higher since the start of
December, in part on bets U.S. corporate earnings would be
strong. While early results have justified that optimism, some
analysts say it may be hard for equities to rise much beyond
current levels.
 ""Sentiment has gotten heavily bullish, and eventually that
will weigh on us,"" said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist
at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia, where he helps
oversee $105 billion in assets. ""I don't think we'll get a
correction, but a pullback or pause seems likely.""
 Gold rose to a one-week high as the dollar fell sharply
against the euro but news that Europe could reach a
comprehensive package in the next two months to solve the
bloc's debt crisis put a damper on safe-haven demand.
 U.S. gold futures for February delivery  settled up
$1.50 an ounce at $1,385.50.
 Oil rose on a tighter supply outlook and after Portugal's
bond sale soothed concern over the euro zone's finances, with
Brent crude, the benchmark for oil trade in Europe, the Middle
East and Africa, closing in on the $100 mark.
 Brent  hit a session high of $98.85 a barrel, the
first time in 27 months it topped $98 as production shutdowns
and growing global demand raised expectations of tighter
supplies. It settled up 51 cents at $98.12. [ID:nL3E7CC0B8]
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  settled up 75 cents at
$91.86 a barrel.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices pared earlier losses from a
strong bid on the sale of reopened 10-year notes.
 The 3.30 ratio of bids received over those accepted was the
highest since the Treasury's 10-year note auction in April,
according to Treasury data.
 U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury notes , down
half a point before the auction, later traded 8/32 lower in
price to yield at 3.37 percent.

 * Animal rights groups attacks agreement
 * Inuit say China market will help them
 By Allan Dowd
 VANCOUVER, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Canada's seal industry has
found a new market in China for products that animal rights
groups have succeeded in getting banned from much of Europe,
officials said on Wednesday.
 China has agreed to allow its consumers to buy seal meat
and oil from Canada, and the deal could pave the way for future
purchases of products such as seal pelts, Canadian Fisheries
Minister Gail Shea said.
 ""The Chinese market holds great potential for the Canadian
seal industry,"" Shea said in a statement from Beijing, where
she was on a trade mission.
 Although sales of seal meat and oil are less lucrative to
hunters than pelt sales, the deal is expected to offset some of
the financial impact of the European Union's ban on seal
products.
 Seal oil is used in a variety of products including Omega 3
supplements.
 The EU has closed its borders to seal products at the
request of animal rights groups, who argue the seal hunt off
Canada's Atlantic Coast is unnecessarily cruel to the animals.
 The International Fund for Animal Welfare dismissed the
trade deal with China as ""political,"" and said it doubted
Chinese would actually buy seal products.
 ""IFAW believes that Chinese consumers, like those in the
European Union, will not condone the horrific slaughter of seal
pups and will reject meat and oil that is tainted by cruelty,""
the group said.
 Canadian sealers, many of whom are native Inuit, say the
allegations of cruelty are based on hunting practices that have
not been used in years, and say the EU's ban is an attack on a
traditional way of life.
 Canada's main seal hunt takes place in March and April on
ice floes off the Atlantic Coast and in the Gulf of St.
Lawrence.
 National Inuit leader Mary Simon applauded the agreement,
saying it will help the industry as it fights to have the
European ban overturned. Canada has challenged the ban before
the World Trade Organization.
 ""I'm pleased that the Chinese government has seen through
the myths and distortions that have been widely disseminated by
animal rights extremists in other parts of the world, such as
Europe,"" Simon said.
 Canada has said the EU ban affects around C$5.4 million of
($5.5 million) business. Officials did not estimate the
potential value of seal product sales to China.
 China is already Canada's third largest export market for
seafood products, according to Canadian officials.

 * Says both fiscal consolidation, structural reforms needed
 
 BRUSSELS, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The European Union took the
first step towards tighter economic policy coordination on
Wednesday as its executive arm set out top economic priorities
for EU governments to be included in 2012 budgets.
 The European Commission said in its Annual Growth Survey
that fiscal consolidation at a fast pace was crucial but it
should be combined with structural reforms to boost employment
and with measures to boost economic growth rates.
 ""The most urgent task is to break the vicious circle ... of
unsustainable debt, financial market disruption and low economic
growth,"" the Commission said in a statement.
 ""Only fiscal corrections of 1 percent of GDP per year or
more would put debt levels in percent of GDP on a firm downward
path over the coming two decades,"" it said.
 ""Although the degree of urgency is not the same in all
Member States, consolidation remains a key policy priority for
all,"" it said.
 Priority-setting is the start of the so-called European
Semester process which is expected to take about six months and
result in EU countries coordinating budget planning.
 The process, part of efforts designed to help prevent
economic crises in the future, will have several stages.
 The Commission's Annual Growth Survey will be the starting
point for EU leaders in March to identify the main challenges
facing the EU and agree on what the response should be.
 Each EU country will then prepare a plan on how it wants to
reform its economy in line with the leaders' guidelines and send
their proposals to the Commission in April for assessment.
 By June-July each country would receive specific guidance on
planned policies from fellow EU ministers and the Commission, in
time for their incorporation into budget drafts before they are
submitted to national parliaments for approval.
 ""A new phase of European integration begins with the Annual
Growth Survey,"" Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said in
a statement.
 ""We are setting out to break new ground and to decisively
improve the way in which we manage and coordinate our
interdependent economies in the European Union.""

 By Mike Dolan
 LONDON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Central banks are pump-priming at
the most aggressive pace in decades, governments are hiking
sales taxes, food and energy costs are surging -- and yet
investors seem strangely casual about inflation risks.
 For sure, there's a powerful argument that recession has
left too much spare capacity in the labour markets, housing,
factories and office space of the big western economies to allow
price bottlenecks to drive consumer price inflation higher.
 But for all the debt-hobbled economic funk in parts of the
United States, Europe and Japan, global growth at large is still
well above trend rates in excess of 4 percent and global
monetary policy is switched to ultra loose.
 Many of the biggest developing economies, such as China,
India, Russia, Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia, continue to grow
briskly and inflation is running at a 5 to 10 percent clip.
 ""The pick-up in input prices has come through globally, not
just in the emerging world. Higher inflation in the emerging
world has implications for the developed world,"" Janet Henry,
economist at HSBC, told reporters this week when flagging the
biggest quarterly rise in the inflation component of HSBC's
emerging markets index in more than two years.
 In essence, aggregate global demand affects global prices
regardless of slack in the west.
 Energy prices are up almost 20 percent in the past three
months. Sugar, corn, soybeans and coffee prices are up more than
20 percent over the same period, some up more than 50 percent
through 2010. Add tax rises, like Britain's 2.5 percentage point
increase in value-added taxes to 20 percent this month, and even
more pressure builds.

 
 STRIPPED TO NOUGHT
 You can strip all these ""volatile"" twists out of inflation
but many people's real experience of prices does have an impact.
 As many groups -- not least wage bargainers and social
groups defending the poor and old -- grow weary of policymakers
and wage setters ignoring such substantial rises in their cost
of living, inflation expectations among the public at large are
starting to gain some traction.
 The University of Michigan's consumer survey on one-year
U.S. inflation expectations jumped back to 3.0 percent last
month from 2.2 percent in September. The Bank of England's
equivalent indicates one-year inflation expectations have jumped
to 3.9 percent -- almost twice the bank's 2 percent target.
 And yet financial markets in the United States and euro zone
continue to price inflation-protected debt securities with
implied inflation rates of less than 3 percent on a five-year
horizon.
 So does relaxed policy and relatively nonchalant market
pricing mean everything's in hand? Well, there are a few
worriers -- and not just commodity bulls and gold bugs.
Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. economist Richard Berner and his
team reckon U.S. inflation is nearing an ""inflection point"" and
will soon start to move higher from the current 1.1 percent.
 ""By midyear, we think investors' outlook for inflation will
begin to change as the forces pushing inflation higher start to
gain the upper hand,"" Berner told clients.
 If so, are central banks such as the Federal Reserve and the
Bank of England -- who are not only pinning interest rates close
to zero but still actively printing money -- justified in
remaining so comfortable with a big output gap?
 
 OUTPUT GAP ERRORS
 Well, this is where it gets trickier. One of the biggest
academic criticisms of policymakers' failure to prevent rampant
double-digit inflation in the 1970s was that they completely
misjudged the extent of the economy's spare capacity, which is
nigh on impossible to see in real time.
 Berner at Morgan Stanley also adds the wrinkle that the
direction in which the output gap is moving, and not just its
overall level, may have major effects on inflation rates and
expectations. This he calls the ""speed effects.""
 In effect, it means a trough in operating rates or a peak in
jobless rates has an impact not only on cyclically-sensitive
global prices like energy and food but also in areas like rents,
which are a major component of U.S. consumer price indexes.
 Although U.S. vacancy rates remain high, they are falling
fast and rents are up almost 5 percent in the year through
November, according to data cited by Morgan Stanley.
 All this may also imply that, faced with huge sovereign
debts and variety of lingering financial stability problems, the
world's central banks are prepared to become a little more
""flexible"" with inflation targets and goals.
 In a paper on inflation targeting last month, Swedish
Riksbank board member Lars Svensson highlighted among other
things the extension of time horizons for reaching those targets
from two to three years recently in Britain, Sweden and Norway.
 Yet greater tolerance of higher inflation in the short run
may still have a profound effect on markets and expectations.
For investors, it may be wise to expect a bumpier ride from now.

 * Spain, Italy debt auctions, ECB on Thursday
 * Markets hopeful of boost to euro zone lending fund
(Adds quote, updates prices)
 NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar for a third day on Wednesday though gains were still
seen as short-lived, with a Portuguese debt sale failing to
stem fears on the funding prospects of peripheral euro zone
countries.
 Rising risk appetite boosted the euro, which climbed above
$1.31 and broke above its 200-day moving average at $1.3071 on
trading platform EBS.
 Lisbon's debt auction saw healthy demand, with the average
yield at the 10-year sale off, compared with a previous one in
November, though 3-year bonds were sold at a significantly
higher yield. For details, see [ID:nLDE70B0BE]
""Markets are far from convinced that the crisis has begun,
let alone ended,"" said Alan Wilde, head of fixed-income and
currency at Baring Asset Management in London. Baring Asset
Management oversees $50 billion in assets.
 ""Temporarily, the ECB has steadied markets using some
judicious buying of sovereigns with the widest spreads, and the
successful Portugese auctions have resulted in a lift for the
euro,"" said Wilde.
 But analysts said the auction results would do little to
change the view that the government in Lisbon will continue to
struggle and may turn to the European Union and International
Monetary Fund for a bailout.
 ""If we look at the 2014 issue, the yield was over 100 basis
points higher than the last auction, which is not a good sign
for Portugal's funding costs going forward,"" said Ronald
Simpson, director of currency research at Action Economics in
Tampa, Florida. ""It keeps the door open (because) at some point
they're going to need to formally ask for assistance.""
 Attention now turns to Spain and Italy, which will sell
debt in auctions on Thursday that will also be closely watched
for signs of contagion. Analysts expect the sales to go without
a major hitch, but at elevated costs.
 The euro  last traded 1.1 percent higher at $1.3120,
after rising as high as $1.3138  on EBS. At the
session peak on Wednesday, the euro traded at the 50 percent
Fibonacci retracement of the move from the January 4 peak to
the January 10 low.
 Analysts said further euro buying probably would not take
the currency much further than $1.3150 in the near term.
Near-term support lies at about $1.2794, the 61.8 Fibonacci
percent retracement of its rally from June to November.
 But a move above the 200-day SMA is seen as a first step
toward improving sentiment toward the currency. The euro-dollar
has now tested the 200-day simple moving average three times
since November 29, according to EBS data.
 If it can hold gains above that level, technical analysts
will view it as long-term support. Conversely if it falls below
and continues to fall, that level will become long-term
resistance.
 RETESTING 4-MONTH LOW
 Also bolstering the euro were comments from euro zone
sources that finance ministers were likely to consider raising
the effective lending capacity of the currency bloc's rescue
fund next week in hopes of calming jittery markets.
[ID:nLDE70A1RM]
 This follows Japan's promise to support an upcoming bond
sale by the fund, the European Financial Stability Facility.
 Sentiment toward the single currency will remain subdued on
persistent concerns that the debt financing problems affecting
Portugal and Spain may spread, with some seeing Belgium in the
firing line due to political instability.
 Traders still expect the euro to retest its four-month low
around $1.2860 set on Monday, with a break likely opening the
door to a fall toward $1.2645 and $1.2590 in the coming weeks.
 The European Central Bank meets on Thursday and investors
will watch if the bank signals further steps to help ease
pressure on peripheral bonds.
 Against the yen, the euro was up 0.8 percent at 108.90 yen
. The dollar fell 0.3 percent to 83.00 yen .
 The euro rose to a session high against the Swiss franc
after the Swiss National Bank Vice Chairman Thomas Jordan said
there are signs the Swiss economy will slow in 2011, though he
still saw growth of about 1.5 percent . The dollar
fell to a session low against the franc .

 * Grains and oilseeds sales will be halted from Monday
 * Argentine farmers at odds with government for years
(Recasts throughout with strike announcement)
 By Helen Popper
 BUENOS AIRES, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Farmers in Argentina will
halt sales of grains and oilseeds for a week to protest
government intervention in wheat and corn exports, reviving a
conflict that helped fuel global food prices in 2008.
 The government pledged on Wednesday to free up another 3
million more tonnes of wheat for export, but the announcement
failed to appease farm leaders, who say a system of export
curbs drives down prices they receive.
 ""What they've announced doesn't meet our objective for
wheat markets that function normally,"" said Hugo Biolcati,
president of the Argentine Rural Society (SRA), one of the four
farming associations that led months of protests almost three
years ago.
 Farmers will stop sending grains to market starting on
Monday, Biolcati told a news conference.
 Growers staged massive demonstrations against grain export
taxes in 2008, hurting President Cristina Fernandez's
popularity and disrupting agricultural sales abroad.
 Argentina is a major global exporter of soy and corn, and
parched conditions this season have helped drive global prices
close to their highest level since mid-2008, raising concerns
about rising food price inflation. [ID:nN09292502]

 Farmers called the strike after meeting Agriculture
Minister Julian Dominguez, who said the additional 3 million
tonnes in export permits means a total of 7 million tonnes has
been approved for shipment.
 But the farm leaders say this does not solve the problem of
low domestic wheat prices and heavy state intervention in the
market. [ID:nN17108731]
 The center-left government limits wheat and corn exports
through a system of export permit quotas to ensure local needs
are met and curb inflation.

(Updates with close of European markets)
 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Global stocks and the euro
rallied on Wednesday after healthy demand for Portugal's debt
sale eased concern over the latest spasm of Europe's lingering
debt crisis and boosted sentiment among investors.
 European stocks hit a 28-month closing high, lifted by
speculation the European Union will bolster the region's rescue
fund, and government bond prices dropped after the Portuguese
bond auction reduced the safe-haven appeal of debt and gold.
 The average yield on Portugal's 10-year bond fell compared
to a previous sale in November, confounding expectations that
yields would top 7 percent for the first time in the history of
the euro zone.
 The euro extended gains versus the U.S. dollar, with
traders citing options-related demand pulling it toward a
session high of $1.3113. For details see [ID:nN12148673]
 That gain put the euro above its 200-day moving average,
which Reuters data put at $1.3070, a level that would be a
first step toward improved euro sentiment, traders said. 
 World stocks as measured by MSCI's all-country world index
<.MIWD00000PUS> advanced 1.4 percent, while it's emerging
markets index <.MSCIEF> gained 1.7 percent.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
European shares finished 1.5 percent higher at 1,163.94 points,
the highest close since September 2008, with Spanish banks
leading a relief rally.
 ""Encouraging news that the EU Commission could use the
region's rescue fund to back sovereign debt issues is helping
bring down risk premiums and this is directly benefiting the
banks,"" said Oscar Moreno, fund manager at Renta4 in Madrid.
 U.S. stocks also gained, helped by signs of strength in the
U.S. banking sector, but Europe played a key role.
 The European debt crisis and future strength in U.S. banks
""are probably the two big stories"" for equities, said Eric
Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment
Management Corp in Chicago.
 Wells Fargo raised the U.S. bank sector to an ""overweight""
rating and JPMorgan Chase & Co  Chief Executive Jamie
Dimon said his bank could pay an annual dividend of 75 cents to
$1 once the Federal Reserve completes and approves stress tests
of the largest U.S. banks. [ID:nN11151339].
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was

at 1,286.62. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 18.00
points, or 0.66 percent, at 2,734.83.
 After Lisbon's successful debt sale, attention now turns to
Spain and Italy, which will sell debt on Thursday in closely
watched auctions. Analysts expect the sales to pass without a
major hitch, albeit at higher costs.
 ""A couple of positive bond auctions might limit euro
losses, but I don't think they are going to alleviate any of
the long-term concerns,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst
at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 ""There's still a huge amount of debt that needs to be
rolled over and that's going to continue to keep investors
wary,"" he added.
 The euro  was last traded up 1.0 percent at $1.3099.
 Oil prices rose after the Portuguese bond sale soothed
concern over the euro zone's finances.
 Spot gold prices  rose to $1,381.67.
 Brent crude oil rose above $98 a barrel for the first time
in 27 months, before paring some gains, as production shutdowns
and growing global demand raised expectations of tighter
supplies. [ID:nL3E7CC0B8]
 A gas leak forced two Norwegian oilfields to shut down
briefly and a leak shut the Trans Alaska Pipeline, which ships
about 12 percent of U.S. crude output, on Saturday although it
has been allowed to resume ""limited operations.""
 Brent , the benchmark for oil trade in Europe, the
Middle East and Africa, rose as much as 85 cents to $98.46, the
highest in 27 months, and was up $1.07 cents at $98.68.
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  rose 86 cents to $91.97 a
barrel.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 17/32 in price to yield 3.40 percent.
 German bonds fell to their lowest since late December. The
March Bund future  dropped 122 ticks in price on the
day, before recovering slightly to settle 110 ticks lower at
124.69.
 The dollar was down against a basket of major currencies,
with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> down 0.86 percent at 80.151.
 Asian shares were flat to slightly higher on the back of
gains on Wall Street and solid U.S. earnings reports. Tokyo's

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar for a third day on Wednesday but gains may be
short-lived as a Portuguese debt sale did little to quell fears
that indebted euro zone countries will struggle to meet their
funding needs.
 Gains in the stock and commodities market lifted investors'
appetite for risk and boosted the euro, which climbed above
$1.31 and broke above its 200-day moving average at $1.3094 on

 But analysts said the auction results would do little to

 This follows Japan's promise to support an upcoming bond

 The European Central Bank meets Thursday and investors will
watch if the bank signals further steps to help ease pressure
on peripheral bonds.
 ""If they continue to downplay some of the debt problems,
then it suggests that officials are getting further behind the

 * Gulf recovery impacts Syrian remittances
 * Syrian state holding company looks to Gulf investors
 
 By Khaled Yacoub Oweis
 DAMASCUS, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Syria has shed its image as a
closed economy and is pushing to attract Gulf investment in the
wake of the global financial crisis, Finance Minister Mohammad
al-Hussein said on Wednesday.
 A Gulf economic recovery will help boost remittances and
reignite interest in Syria, including agriculture and industry
on top of large real estate projects, Hussein told Reuters after
meeting the economy minister of the United Arab Emirates.
 ""Investors may have an old image of Syria. We now have
banking and insurance facilities, transfers and capital
movement,"" Hussein said.
 ""We expect these investments to rise with the Emirates
moving past the global crisis,"" said Hussein, referring to
official estimates that the economy in the United Arab Emirates
will grow 3 to 3.5 percent this year.
 A Reuters poll in December indicated that growth prospects
for the Gulf were improving, with rising oil prices and state
spending after the global downturn hit output in 2009.
 The International Monetary Fund said the impact of the
crisis on Syria was limited, with 5 percent economic growth in
2010 compared with 4 percent the previous year.
 Foreign investment into Syria fell only 2.2 percent to $1.4
billion in 2009, according to latest United Nations data.
Hussein acknowledged that Gulf appetite had waned during the
crisis, although investors did not pull back from major
projects.
 Syria has lifted several restrictions on private enterprise
in the last 10 years as part of attempts to reverse the economic
malaise that has gripped the country since the Baath Party took
power in 1963, imposing Soviet-style policies and still active
emergency law.
Encouraged by the new policies and cheap land offered by the
government, Gulf conglomerate Majid Al-Futtaim Group began last
year a delayed $1 billion project near Damascus, adjacent to a
$500 million project by Emaar Properties.
 But several Gulf investors, including Saleh Kamel, head of
the Dallah al-Baraka conglomerate, have criticised corruption
and what they described as Syrian government machinery that
hinders foreign investment.
 U.S. sanctions, which were imposed on Syria in 2004 for the
government's support for militant groups, have also kept Western
investors away and hampered the development of the oil sector.
 Hussein said that much of the problems are being solved ""on
the phone"" with Gulf officials and that main impediments to
investment are a thing of the past.
 ""There are no major problems left. We work on solving
obstacles,"" he said.
 Hussein said a new holding company owned by the Syrian state
that was set up through a special law last year with capital of
$108 million will look for Gulf partners in projects.
 ""We are choosing members of the board and setting up the
headquarters. The company can go into partnership with
investors of any nationality. The law allows it,"" he said.
 The minister, one of the most powerful cabinet members, did
not give figures. But the World Bank estimates that remittances
from Syrian expatriates, a major source of hard currency after
oil, were stable at $1.4 billion in the last three years.
 The volume is low compared with $8.7 billion for Lebanon and
$3.8 billion for Jordan estimated in 2010.

 * Will continue to buy Spanish bonds: vice foreign minister
 
 By Sebastian Tong and Sujata Rao
 LONDON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - China is prepared to participate
in any future euro zone stabilisation measures, seeing the euro
as a key pillar of a multi-currency global financial system,
deputy central bank governor Yi Gang said on Wednesday.
 Speaking at a briefing in London by the People's Bank of
China (PBOC) and Chinese government officials, Yi also said
Beijing would take into ""positive consideration"" the question of
investing in the euro zone's emergency fund for member states.
 ""China indeed supports the series of stabilisation measures
adopted by the European Union, the ECB (European Central Bank)
and the IMF (International Monetary Fund),"" Yi said.
 ""China is a stable and continued long-term investor in
European financial markets and I'm sure if there's need of the
European emergency fund or the stabilisation mechanism, we would
like to actively participate in these mechanisms -- of course
with your permission."" 
 The European Financial Stability Facility is a 440 billion
euro ($570 billion) fund that helps heavily indebted euro zone
nations and can raise funds on international markets.
 Recent Chinese pledges to buy Spanish and Portuguese bonds
have already helped shore up debt markets in the euro zone
periphery as well as the single currency.
 Yi said China's assistance should be seen as part of a
long-term process, dictated partly by its own need to diversify
investments but also by its faith in the euro's viability.
 China is keen to diversify its official currency reserves --
now at a record $2.85 trillion -- with the euro the primary
alternative to the dollar, taking an estimated 25 percent, or
about $710 billion.
 ""The principles of investment of Chinese reserves is that we
pursue diverse investments in financial markets around the
world. We will continue to do so,"" Yi said.
 He added: ""We support the diversified international currency
system and we do think the euro is a very important pillar of
that system. That's why we have full confidence in the euro.""
 However, a former adviser to the central bank has warned of
the risks associated with buying peripheral euro zone debt..
 Yi is among a 50-strong delegation of Chinese officials
headed by Vice Premier Li Keqiang which ends a four-day visit to
Britain on Wednesday. Li, who visited Germany and Spain last
week, said on Tuesday Europe would remain a major destination
for Chinese investment.
 Yi declined to specify how much Spanish debt Beijing had
purchased but Vice Foreign Minister Fu Ying who also attended
the briefing said: ""China has bought Spanish bonds and will
continue to purchase.""

 * Contagion, refinancing worries may see it drop to $1.25
 * Speculators increase bearish bets against euro
 
 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The euro will come under more
pressure in early 2011 as it is held hostage to concerns about
peripheral euro zone debt and edgy investors brace for sovereign
bond sales that will test the appetite for the common currency.
 The pressure will be unrelenting, given some analysts
estimate euro zone countries' 2011 gross funding requirements at
up to 860 billion euros.
 While that is less than the nearly 900 billion euros in
gross borrowings in 2010, a bulk of the refinancing is scheduled
for the first half of 2011.
 Analysts say the euro will be driven lower by rising
borrowing costs for the euro zone's weaker states, most of them
on the southern periphery, and Cs more investors price in the
risk of debt-laden Portugal seeking an international bailout and
of the contagion engulfing Spain.
 The lack of an effective policy response to the debt crisis
is only sden exacerbating the euro's gloomy outlook.
 ""Our three-month forecast for euro/dollar is $1.25, a target
likely to be met given the large scale bond refinancing due in
the first half of 2011 by the euro zone's peripheral countries,""
said Mansoor Mohi-uddin, chief currency strategist at UBS.
 The euro was at $1.3050 on Wednesday, having lost more than
6 percent against the dollar in 2010, its biggest annual slide
since 2005. It has started 2011 on a weak note as peripheral
bond spreads over Germany have widened with investors' renewed
focus on the euro zone debt crisis.
 There is a strong correlation between widening yield spreads
on pe2ipheral debt and the euro.
 Indeed, as the 10-yaar Portuguese government yield has
risen, so has the euro fallen in the past few weeks. On a 66-day
basis, the correlation between the euro and the yield on the
10-year bond Portuguese bond has tightened to 0.84 from around
0.59 at the end of November.
 Many suspect that if upcoming bond auctions from Portugal,
seen as the next most likely bailout candidate after Greece and
Ireland, and Spain draw a lukewarm response or if the debt is
sold at very high yields, the euro could fall further.
 On Wednesday, Portugal sold 10-year bonds to strong demand
from overseas investors, although confidence remained brittle.
 ""Recent history suggests that the euro weakened in the run
up to the Greek and the Irish bailouts,"" said Valentin Mannov,
strategist at Citi. ""A repetition of the same pattern could see
the euro remaining vulnerable in the near term.""
 
 HARD TO @STIMATE
 ING strategist Tom Levinson said it was hard to estimate the
degree to which a bailout for Portugal was already priced into
ÿthe euro ""but for the euro a move down to the $1.25 area cannot
be ruled out, especially were EU authorities to be slow to act"".
 A commitment from strong sovereign names like Japan and
China to buy European debt would only slow the euro's decline.
 A Reuters poll taken last week showed that some large
European banks were expecting the euro to fall to $1.23 in the
next 12 months. The euro struck a four-year low of $1.1876 in
June last year and a re-visit of that level cannot be ruled out.
 While a rescue for Portugal is widely expected, many in
markets have feared contaeion could spread to Spain -- the euro
zone's fourth largest economy -- or even Belgium.
 Any rescue would require an increase in the size of the
currency bloc's bailout fund, the European Financial Stability
Fund, an issue that is still being discussed.
 So uncertainty around European policymakers' desire to
respond more aggressively to contain the debt crisis looks set
to persist in coming months and will cloud the euro's outlook.
 
 BEARISH POSITIONING IN EURO
 Some of that uncertainty has led speculators to increase
bearish bets against the euro. The latest data from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission show bets the euro will
fall have more than tripled since the end of November. 
 In the week ended Jan 4, net euro short contracts were at
24,201, up from around 7,248 contracts in the week to Nov 30,
though still off from a record 113,890 in May.
 UBS said in note the fact positioning had not reached last
year's extreme levels meant a major downtrend was possible.

 * German GDP shows euro zone consolidation works
 * Plays down talk of boosting euro crisis funding

(Adds more quotes and background)
 By Stephen Brown
 BERLIN, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Germany's economic rebound in
2010, its strongest growth since reunification, shows fiscal
consolidation works and there should be no talk of tax cuts in
the next two years, a top German official said on Wednesday.
 After Germany reported 3.6 percent growth for 2010, with the
public deficit heading back to the recommended euro zone limit
of 3 percent this year, Deputy Finance Minister Steffen Kampeter
effectively headed off any political pressure for tax cuts.
 ""Our strategy to combine consolidation with growth-friendly
policies seems to be working properly, we are satisfied with the
results, but it shows we have to go on with the consolidation
task,"" Kampeter told Reuters in an interview.
 Kampeter, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's
conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), said that although net
new borrowing was nearly half the forecast level in 2010, debt
was still the highest in history, leaving no room for manoeuvre.
 ""If we go on with consolidation in this legislative period
(ending in 2013) we might discuss tax cuts at the end, but at
the moment fiscal consolidation is number one on the agenda,"" he
said.
 Merkel is already under pressure from her Free Democrat
(FDP) coalition partners, who are seeking action on a 2009
campaign promise of tax cuts to revive their rock-bottom
popularity. With seven state elections due this year, the
conservative German chancellor needs to boost FDP leader Guido
Westerwelle.
 Opinion polls show the FDP has lost a huge amount of support
for not delivering on the promise and it cannot muster the 5
percent required to enter parliament, in contrast to its record
14.6 percent vote share in the 2009 election.
 
 HINT FOR EURO ZONE
 Rainer Bruederle, the German economy minister and an FDP
leader cited as a potential replacement for Westerwelle, said
the GDP data showed growth was twice as strong as the European
Union average, with employment also at record levels.
 But CDU Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble insists growth
is not a licence to cut taxes, and that German consumers feel
more confident, and spend more, with the deficit under control.
 ""For our national economy, consolidation is a growth driver,
among other factors,"" said Kampeter. ""There's no tension between
consolidation and a growing economy.""
 German policy should serve as a ""hint and maybe a model"" for
the euro zone, he said, adding that growing internal demand also
addressed complaints from the United States, among others, of
global imbalances caused by export economies like Germany.
 The German official was cool on proposals from Brussels to
beef up the EU/International Monetary Fund euro zone bailout
fund, and even slap a one-off 50 billion euro levy on banks to
help tackle crises in future.
 Kampeter called the bank tax ""an interesting contribution""
to debate but said Germany had already legislated for bank taxes
for 2011 ""and I don't see a window for further action"".
 Markets in general were ""over-estimating uncertainty and
risks in public debt"" while a successful Portuguese bond auction
on Wednesday should help make the atmosphere ""more rational"".

(Adds comments on 2020 targets, closing shares)
 By Tim Hepher
 LES MUREAUX, France, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Airbus basked in the
world's biggest commercial plane order on Wednesday, with shares
in parent EADS lifted by its $15.6 billion 180-aircraft deal
with Indian airline IndiGo.
 The agreed purchase underlines India's development as a
major aviation market and provides a welcome boost to EADS Chief
Executive Louis Gallois, who has been pushing expansion into
emerging markets as traditional markets falter.
 It also gets an early blow in for Airbus in the annual
battle with U.S. rival Boeing for sales supremacy.
 EADS shares rose as much as 6 percent to a three-year high
and closed up 2.2 percent at 20.5 euros.
 ""It is the best way to start the year,"" Gallois said at an
annual news conference, during which he also set the tone for a
strong showing in orders when Airbus meets the press on Jan. 17.
 ""There are at least 500 orders and deliveries and there are
more orders than deliveries for 2010,"" Gallois said. 
 Airbus is chasing Boeing which sold a net 530 planes and
delivered 462 in 2010, but leads in the number of planes built
each year. It is close to achieving its 10,000th plane order.
 It reported 388 net plane orders up to the end of November,
or 440 before cancellations. It delivered 461 jets.
 In December, Airbus announced a Chilean order for 50 planes
and on Jan. 4 another for 15 from Easyjet. Whether that new year
announcement is included in the 2010 tally could help determine
how close Airbus comes to matching Boeing.
 A backlog of draft orders announced in 2010 which have yet
to be finalised includes up to 60 planes for Virgin America.
 The results of the annual order race are not only a question
of pride between fierce rivals, but have become mired in wider
issues as they confront each other over a potential large U.S.
air tanker order and a trade row over aircraft subsidies.
 Boeing backers say Airbus should be barred from the $50
billion tanker contest because its sales are boosted by unfair
aid in developing planes, a charge which EADS denies. Mutual
subsidy claims are being aired at the World Trade Organisation.
 
 PROFITS UNSATISFACTORY
 Both Airbus and Boeing fared better than first predicted
last year as lessors and many airlines saw global recession
easing.
 But Airbus's success in winning orders delivers a poisoned
chalice to other divisions in space, defence and helicopters.
They must run faster to meet a goal of rebalancing the share of
income, now dominated by Airbus, across the group by 2020.
 ""Airbus growth is making the targets more difficult to
reach, but I can't complain. It is a problem of rich people. I
prefer to have this problem than a problem with the growth of
Airbus,"" Gallois said.
 Gallois said EADS profits were unsatisfactory due to poor
currency hedges and high costs. He said profitability would be
similar in 2011 to 2010 targets before recovering from 2012.
 EADS targets operating profit of at least 1.1 billion euros
($1.4 billion) in 2010 after a 322 million loss in 2009.
 Analysts at DZ bank, which has a sell recommendation, said
investors would remain nervous about profitability at EADS for a
while amid European defence cuts and the threat of production
delays to the next Airbus plane, the mid-sized A350.
 Indian airlines are adding planes as demand booms. While
passenger traffic grew by 19 percent through November, India has
only 400 commercial planes against China's 2,600.
 Indian budget carrier IndiGo's provisional purchase includes
the first order for a revamped jet, the A320neo, designed to
help airlines weather oil prices near $100.
 Gallois outlined plans to build the company around ""three
pillars"" -- Europe, the United States and emerging markets.
 He projected production of two A380s a month in 2011,
compared with below-target deliveries of 18 superjumbos in 2010.
 Engine checks on the world's largest airliner following last
year's Qantas emergency scuppered Airbus's hopes of meeting a
target of delivering 20 A380 superjumbos in 2010.
 Gallois played down who would succeed him in his politically
sensitive post in 2012, saying this wasn't an issue at present.
 EADS was formed in 2000 from a merger of French, German and
Spanish interests in a bid to create a European rival to larger
U.S. giants such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin.
 It has been rocked by frequent in-fighting over the
Franco-German power balance. Secret U.S. cables leaked by the
Wikileaks website suggested tensions over ownership of sensitive
technology had resurfaced inside its Astrium space division.
 Astrium Chief Eexecutive Francois Auque said a German space
executive who was reported to have run down French space efforts
in private talks with U.S. diplomats faced internal questioning.

 * $11 bln UAE railway seen boosting economic growth
 * Chinese, European companies to compete over contracts
 
 By Martina Fuchs
 DUBAI, Jan 12 (Reuters) - United Arab Emirates boasts the
world's tallest building, a man-made island in the shape of a
palm and is about to take its next ambitious step - linking
cities by rail over the desert.
 Already investing heavily in airlines and airports, as well
as roads and public infrastructure, to attract and support
growing commerce, the seven emirates are leaving nothing to
chance as they bet on a freight and passenger network to help
drive growth.
 At stake for European and Chinese companies is a total $11
billion to be spent on the project, as UAE's Union Railway
pushes to complete the rail system by 2017.
 Even as the country struggles to regain its footing after
the 2009 Dubai debt crisis and an exodus of investors, it is
betting that there will be enough economic activity to
justify the rail system. To that end, it is starting with
freight and adding passenger services.
 Dubai is still building out a metro network launched in 2009
linking the emirates malls and business areas, but passenger
volume is still sparse, bringing into question whether a
national railway system will work in a country dominated by cars
fuelled with cheap gas.
 China, which sees the Gulf as a key strategic region,
appear3 to be in a good position to win contracts.
 ""If the decisions are made on price and basic quality of
value for money criteria, I don't see how any foreign company
could compete unless you get one of the European export-import
banks to go in and try to match Chinese financing,"" said Bill
McCahill, Vice Chairman for Pacific Epoch in Shanghai.
 ""What they do, it may not be the most cutting edge
technology, the sort of Gucci leather in first class sort of
thing, but it is good enough and is reliable for the most part.""

 DESERT DREAMS
 Union Railway is hoping that the 1,500 kilometre freight and
passenger network across the seven-member emirates will start
its first complete service in 2017.
 The first project is due for completion by 2014, linking the
Shah sour gas field of state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Company
(ADNOC) to Ruwais and to the Shah sour gas field, which in early
2013 will begin carrying granulated sulphur from Habshan to
Ruwais for export.
 Eventually the system will connect the UAE to Saudi Arabia
via Ghweifat city in the West and Oman via Al Ain in the East.
 Richard Bowker, Union Railway Chief Executive, said interest
in bidding for the initial work, such as moving earth and laying
track, has been high.
 ""There have been companies from China, Korea, Australia,
Europe,"" Bowkÿýer said.
 Union Railway has already awarded a project management
contract to a joint venture of U.S. firm Parsons, and France's
Systra, and a preliminary engineering contract to Parsons
Brinckerhoff for the first two phases.
 Europe's top logistics and engineering firms such as French
Alstom, German Siemens and Canadian group Bombardier are also
expected to submit bids.
 ""Many projects are under detailed planning or even tender
and will become reality in the very near future,"" said Vincent
Prou, Alstom's business development director in Dubai.
 Freight trains, for heavy goods such as cement, aluminium,
or steel, will reach speeds of up to 120 kilometres per hour
(kph) and passenger trains up to 200 kph.
 Rail development is also being driven, in part, by the need
to transport oil and gas in the UAE, the world's No. 3 oil
exporter No. 5 in gas reserves.
 Chinese companies are already building up their experience
in laying down networks on the desert peninsula.
 China Railway Construction Corp built the $1.8 billion Mecca
Metro between Mecca and the holy sites of Mina, Arafat and
Muzdalifah, Saudi Arabia's first dual-track light railway, which
opened in November to ease congestion during the annual Haj
pilgrimage.
 ""We get strong interest from Chinese companies,"" said
Abdulaziz al-Hokail, president of the Saudi Railways
Organization, adding the Chinese were also active as
construction agents in phase one of the Haramain High-Speed Rail
and in the North South railway project.
 The biggest beneficiaries are likely to be Chinese companies
such as China South Locomotive and Rollin"

(Adds economist's analysis, details)
 By Glenn Somerville and David Lawder
 WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner said on Wednesday that China needs to let its
yuan currency strengthen more quickly, a move which could open
up long-denied access to U.S. technology.
 Offering a carrot-and-stick approach before a state visit
by Chinese President Hu Jintao, Geithner said failure by China
to allow more currency appreciation could hurt its economy.
 ""China still closely manages the level of its exchange rate
and restricts the ability of capital to move in and out of the
country,"" Geithner said. ""These policies have the effect of
keeping the Chinese currency substantially undervalued.""
 He described China as focused on taking greater advantage
of U.S. investment opportunities, gaining more market access
and being able to buy U.S.-made high-tech goods.
 ""We are willing to make progress on these issues but our
ability to move on these issues will depend of course on how
much progress we see from China,"" Geithner said in an address
at Johns Hopkins' School of Advanced International Studies.
 The U.S. is reluctant to let China have freer access to
high-tech products when Beijing is conditioning access to its
markets on companies agreeing to yield their technology to
Chinese competitors.

 Economics and trade will be a major element of next week's
White House talks, but are just one item on an agenda intended
to set a better tone for relations after disagreements between
Washington and Beijing last year over North Korean attacks on
South Korea, Internet censorship, human rights, South China Sea
navigation, climate change and valuable rare earth minerals.
 The U.S. has sought a faster yuan rise for years. U.S.
manufacturers and politicians complain that Beijing manipulates
its currency to gain an unfair trade advantage.
 Since unshackling the yuan  from a peg to the
U.S. dollar in June, China's currency has risen about 3
percent. Geithner pointed out that because inflation is higher
in China than in the United States, the yuan is rising more
rapidly on an inflation-adjusted basis.
 He said Beijing would be better off letting its currency
strengthen now to cap inflation.
 ""The most important thing to understand is it is going to
happen. There is no alternative path,"" Geithner said. ""The only
choice for China is how it happens, and what mix happens
through inflation and through the exchange rate itself.""
 Economist Derek Scissors of the Heritage Foundation said
Geithner was telling the U.S. Congress that ""what we want is a
real exchange rate appreciation, and we can get that in a
couple different ways, so let's not get hung up on how much the
nominal exchange rate changes.""
 China counters that Washington's staggering $1.3 trillion
budget deficit poses the main risk to the global economy and
Beijing laid down its own marker on Wednesday ahead of the Jan.
19 talks between Hu and U.S. President Barack Obama.
 Beijing would like to see a ""positive"" U.S. statement about
the security of China's dollar-denominated assets, Vice Foreign
Minister Cui Tiankai said, offering a reminder that the United
States relies heavily on borrowing from China to finance its
day-to-day operations. For more see [ID:nN09519970].
 Geithner dismissed it as part of a ""typical pattern"" by
Chinese foreign ministry officials trying to stake out a
bargaining position ahead of official talks.
 He conceded, though, that the U.S. government must ""restore
fiscal responsibility"" and said that includes cutting spending
and reforming the tax system to encourage more investment.
 Geithner said U.S. exports to China will top $100 billion
this year, twice the rate of exports to the rest of the world.
 But he complained that theft of U.S. intellectual property
was rampant in China and U.S. companies faced unfair barriers
that Beijing must dismantle.
 The pilfering of U.S. intellectual property, including
under Beijing's so-called ""indigenous innovation"" policy that
ties foreigners' market access to technology transfer, is the
main reason for the curbs on exports of high-technology
products that China consistently demands Washington remove.
 ""The Chinese are asking for high-end commercial stuff and
we're telling them: 'not until you protect intellectual
property and you've got an indigenous innovation policy that
says steal it',"" says Scissors.

 WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - U.S. import prices jumped

coming from overseas.
 Import prices rose 1.1 percent, just beneath economists'

in 2009.
 A low inflation environment in the United States has
allowed the Federal Reserve to mainTain a very loose monetary
policy, but a recent spike in global energy and commodity

 One big reason for tame price growth has been the weakness
in the housing market, which some economists worry will take an
extended period to recover.
 The latest data offered some modest encouragement, with
applications for U.S. home mortgages rising as lending rates
eased from recent highs.
 The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally

 It had dropped on a lull in refinancing activity as
influential U.S. Treasury yields soared in late 2010. Fixed

from 4.82 percent the prior week and 4.93 percent before the

(Releads, updates throughout)
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The euro held earlier gains on
Wednesday after strong demand at a Portuguese government debt
auction quell%d some immediate concerns about the country's
funding problems.
 The euro barely moved after Lisbon sold 1.249 billion euros
in debt, including 10-year bonds which were sold at a lower
average cost tèat at a previous sale, while three-year bonds
went at a significantly higher yield.
 Analysts said the euro would remain under selling pressure,
extending its sell-off to a four-month low earlier this week, as
the sale did little to change the view that Portugal was likely
to seek a bailout for its mounting debt costs.
 ""All the Portuguese auction does is buy a little bit of time
for Portuguese authorities,"" said Jane Foley, currency
strategist at Rabobank.
 ""It certainly doesn't rule out the (possibility) that they
will have to ask for a bailout, it just means that they will be
able to delay it for a few weeks.""
 By 1128 GMT, the euro was unchanged on the day at $1.2975,
holding above a four-month low of $1.2860 plumbed at the start
of the week.
 Also bolstering the euro were comments from euro zone
sources that finance ministers are likely to consider next week
raising the effective lending capacity of the currency bloc's
rescue fund as part of efforts to calm jittery markets.
 This follows Japan's promise to support an upcoming bond
sale by the fund, the European Financial Stability Facility.
 Despite support for the euro on Wednesday, technical
analysts say it faces stiff resistance around $1.3070, the
200-day moving average. 
""The near-term risks will remain to the downside until there
is a clear breach of the 200-day moving average,"" BTM UFJ
analysts said in a note.

 SPAIN AUCTION EYED
 Analysts said the Portuguese auction results would do little
to change the view that Lisbon will continue to struggle to fund
itself and may have to turn to the European Union an
International Monetary Fund for a bailout, which would
ultimately keep the euro weak.
 Many argue that sentiment towards the single currency will
remain subdued due to persistent concerns that the debt
financing problems affecting Portugal and Spain may spread to
other euro zone countries, with some seeing Belgium in the
firing line due to political instability.
 Rabobank's Foley added that a Spanish auction on Thursday
would offer a better indication of whether the debt crisis,
which has already forced Ireland and Greece to seek assistance
from the EU and the IMF, can be contained.
 Against the yen, the euro was flat at 108.01 yen, well off
four-month lows around 106.81 set on Monday.

 By Emily Kaiser and Caren Bohan
 WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The United States wants a
""real, demonstrative commitment"" from China that it is serious
about shifting away from export-led economic growth, a U.S.
official told Reuters on Tuesday ahead of next week's state
visit by China's Hu Jintao.
 Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner will on Wednesday lay
out his vision for how the world's two biggest economic powers
should interact. But the official's comments indicate some
impatience with China's gradual approach to allowing its
currency to rise and building up domestic demand.
 ""It's both the pace in which they do it and the conviction
with which they demonstrate they're going to do it,"" said the
senior Obama administration official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
 ""What we still need to see in the first instance is that
real, demonstrable commitment to the objective"" of rebalancing
the economy, the officaal said.
 Washington has pressed Beijing for years to allow the yuan
to rise more rapidly to cool its exÿports, narrow a trade gap,
and shrink a $2.8 trillion pile of reserves.
 But China counters that U.S. economic policies are
responsible for the imbalances and has urged the United States
to get its own fiscal house in order before its mountain of
debt destabilizes the global economy.
 The Jan. 19 White House talks mark the first face-to-face
meeting between President Barack Obama and Hu since the Group

disappointment for Washington.
 Not only did Obama get scant international support at the
G20 meeting for pressuring China to speed up the yuan's rise,
but he also got an earful from allies about his own country's

Federal Reserve's decision to buy $600 billion in government
debt to try to spur a stronger economic recovery.
 Eswar Prasad, a Brookings Institution economist and former

 * U.S. crop report seen highlighting tight supplies
 * South Korea hold emergency meeting of animal disease
 * India delays bill aimed at food for the poor

 By Bruce Hextall	
 SYDNEY, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Australia's worst floods in
decades shut down a key grains port, adding further
restrictions to the country's exports and underlining concern
about tight global grain supplies and rising food inflation.	
 Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific, South Korea's cabinet held
an emergency meeting to combat the spread of foot and mouth
disease that has forced meat prices higher and Thailand raised
interest rates, citing pressure on inflation from commodity
prices.	
 A report by the U.N. food agency last week showed that
world food prices hit a record high in December and it warned
that key grains prices could rise further, a factor that is
expected to be underlined by a U.S. government report due
later on Wednesday.	
 Food inflation has risen to the top of the agenda for
policymakers with memories still fresh of a 2008 food crisis,
when soaring prices sparked riots in several countries, high
inflation and in many cases deep trade deficits.	
 Countries including China, India and Brazil are battling
with double-digit food inflation.	
 The rise in food prices in fast-growing economies makes it
important for monetary authorities to anchor inflation
expectations, global central bankers said on
Monday.[ID:nLDE7091PO]	
 Leading economies in the Group of 20 have promised action
and several countries have already introduced price controls
to try to reassure consumers, or boosted food supplies.	
 In Australia, one of the world's top four wheat exporters,
the biggest floods in the country's history forced
Queensland's major grain terminal of Fisherman Island to shut
down.	
 Although Queensland is a small wheat exporter compared
with other states, the shut down highlights the setbacks to
the national crop, where heavy rains have already reduced the
amount of high-protein grain preferred by major markets.	
 
 Wheat prices rose 47 percent last year, corn more than 50
percent and U.S. soybeans by 34 percent. The U.N. Food and
Agricultural Organization (FAO) said in its report key grains
prices could rise further.[ID:nLDE7041BM]	
 Wheat was buoyed by adverse weather conditions, including
drought in Russia and its Black Sea neighbours.	
 A U.S. report later in the day is expected to confirm that
the country's grain stock is the lowest in years, darkening
hopes of any relief from surging world food
prices.[ID:nN12159392]	
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture monthly report is also
expected to show that severe weather conditions was hurting
harvests in Argentina, a major corn and soybean exporter, and
Australia.	
 Analysts expect the report to say that U.S. corn stocks
have dropped to their lowest level in 15 years.	
 The FAO said that its indexes measuring meat and sugar
prices hit a record high in December while cereals, which
cover the main food groups of wheat, rice and corn, were their
highest since the 2008 crisis.	
 Analysts say a 2008-like crisis is far from certain
though. Some said further adverse weather conditions would be
needed to drive food prices much higher than current levels.	
 Jonathan Anderson, who covers emerging markets for UBS,
said global food price indexes would have to rise another 50
percent to deliver the same inflation impact as three years ago.	
 While weather shocks are disrupting food supplies, there
has been no repeat of the leap in energy and fertiliser prices
or of the accompanying hoarding that were features of the 2008
crisis; nor do underlying supply and demand dynamics appear to
have changed, Anderson said.	
 ""In this environment, as long as accelerating global food
inflation is assumed to be a temporary phenomenon, and as long
as we're not back to a full-on food price 'disaster' a la
2008, we believe that emerging market central banks will
continue to be relatively relaxed in their policy response,""
he said in a report.	
 South Korea unveiled steps on Tuesday to increase the
supply of food to help control prices as demand rises ahead of
the Lunar New Year at the beginning of next month.	
 On Wednesday, the cabinet held an emergency meeting to
deal with a rapidly expanding outbreak of foot and mouth,
which sparked a sharp rise in pork and beef prices after the
slaughter of 10 percent of the country's cattle and pigs to
deal with the disease.	
 Thailand's central bank raised interest rates on Wednesday
by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.25 percent, as
expected by financial analysts. The Bank of Thailand cited
growing pressure on inflation from a ""clear upward trend in
oil and commodity prices"". [ID:nSGE70A06P]	
 In India, where food inflation is running at a year high
of 18 percent, the Financial Express newspaper reported that a
bill aimed at providing cheap and easily available grains for
the poor will be delayed by a year. Backers of the bill say
the law would protect more than 400 million Indians.
[ID:nSGE70B02I]	
 The ruling coalition government is under fire over the
high price of food, particularly onions, which are widely used
in Indian dishes.

By Martin Roberts
 MADRID, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Wheat shipments to
import-dependent Spain have slowed due to climbing world prices
as buyers have turned to cheaper domestic wheat or imported
maize and sorghum, port and trade sources say.
 A port source in Tarragona, Spain's leading grain port,
estimated that wheat stocks stood at about 200,000 tonnes, which
is down from about 300,000 in September but comfortably above a
low of 75,000 reached in July.
 Buyers were loading some 8,000 tonnes a day of wheat and
other feed grains, down from an average of 12,000 tonnes.
 ""When port prices are high, then domestic wheat has a lot of
legs,"" the source said.
 ""I don't think port traffic will pick up until the harvest
in Bulgaria and Romania comes in June or July, when prices might
be a better fit. Meanwhile, there's no sign of prices falling.""
 Prompt feed wheat was last quoted at 248 euros ($321.80) per
tonne in Tarrcgona, while feed makers in the northern
Castilla-Leon grain belt can buy it for 216 euros. Inland wheat
usually trades at a premium to ports, because local buyers have
to pay overland freight charges foR imports.
 Bulgaria and Romania have been the favourite countries of
origin for Spanish wheat buyers since the Black Sea counuries
joined the European Union in 2007.
 Some 325,000 tonnes of Bulgarian and Romanian feed wheat
flooded into Tarragona between July and September last year, but
just 15,000 tonnes are currently exxected.
 ""For now, it is hard to charter boats from northern Europe
and the Black Sea, and prices quoted there are above the Spanish
market,"" said a report from the Mercolleida agricultural
exchange.
 Spain sometimes imports wheat from Ukraine under the EU's
tariff rate quota scheme, but importers have shown little
interest in recent months.
 
 MAIZE
 Traders say compounders have more appetite for maize and
sorghum imports and that rye has reappeared for the first time
since July last year.
 Tarragona silos are holding maize from Brazil, Paraguay,
Ukraine and some left over from the first bulk shipment from the
United States in at least 12 years.
 Maize shipments are particularly brisk to Cartagena, Spain's
second-most important grains port, where the roster showed
55,000 tonnes unloading from Russia in addition to 39,000 from
Romania last week.
 Spain can not grow enough grain to meet its needs due to its
arid, unpredictable climate and poor soil, so it needs to import
at least 10 million tonnes of grain a year from around the
world.
 EU trade agreements allow Spain to import up to 2 million
tonnes a year from outside the 27-country bloc at a reduced
levy, as well as 300,000 tonnes of sorghum.

482,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2011 06:04AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-China's rapidly growing private equity industry," Jan 12 (Reuters) - China's securities regulator and state economic planner
are embroiled in a turf battle over who should have oversight of the rapidly
growing private equity sector.	
 The power play by the China Securities Regulatory Commission spells
uncertainty and adds to the string of regulators the sector already has to
deal with. [ID:nTOE70B01C]	
 Here are some facts about China's private sector:	
 
 NEW FUNDS	
 In 2010, 82 China-focused private equity funds were set up, raising $27.6
billion yuan. That was more than double the $12.96 billion yuan raised by 30
funds during the previous year, according to Beijing-based fund consultancy
Zero2ipo.	
 Of the 82 funds, 71 were denominated in the Chinese currency ,
although they only raised a combined $10.7 billion, compared with $16.94
billion by generally much bigger hard-currency funds.	
 Zero2ipo estimated that 31 private equity funds set up last year have not
yet finished fundraising, and they target to raise a combined $12.2 billion.	
 Highlighting investor sensitivity to central government policies, 68 new
funds last year were targeting growth companies, while 10 were real estate
funds and four M&A funds.	
 Sectors that received government support gained investor favour, with
biotechnology, pharmaceutical and healthcare ranking among the most popular
industries, followed by clean-tech, machinery, food & beverage and retail,
Zero2ipo said.	
 
 REGULATORY STAKEHOLDERS	
 The National Development and Reform Commission, the state economic
planner, is currently the PE sector's main regulator by default after
approving the establishment of several government funds.	
 The China Securities Regulatory Commission proposed in 2009 revisions to
the Securities Investment Funds Law, seeking to emerge as the sector's new
main regulator.	
 Private equity firms complain that they face difficulty getting domestic
listing approval for the companies they have invested in, which eliminates a
key avenue used in developed countries to exit investments.	
 Other stakeholders include the Ministry of Commerce and the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).	
 The ministry has been criticised by some as being over-protective of
national interests and strategic industries. It rejected Coca-Cola's
$2.4 billion bid for China's top juice maker Huiyuan , in 2009 and
buyout giant Carlyle's $375 million bid for Xugong, China's biggest
construction equipment maker, in 2008.	
 Foreign private equity seeking to set up yuan-denominated funds in China
have complained about the tedious approval process for foreign exchange quotas
by SAFE.	
 
 TIANJIN TEST BED	
 The northern port city of Tianjin is the hub of the private equity
industry in China, counting 396 funds totalling 76 billion yuan ($11.13
billion) in registered capital as of the end of April last year.	
 About 20 such funds register each month in Tianjin due to its status as a
test-bed for financial reforms.	
 About 110 of the funds registered in Tianjin have foreign participation,
and 20-30 are fully foreign funds.	
 For Tianjin, attracting funds is a way to build a financial industry and
diversify beyond shipping and steel.	
 
 SHANGHAI PILOT PROGRAMME	
 China's financial hub Shanghai will allow foreign private equity firms
convert overseas funds worth $3 billion into yuan for direct investment under
a pilot programme, according to the China Securities Journal.	
 Initially, global buyout firms including the Blackstone Group , the
Carlyle Group and First Eastern Investment Group will be given a
combined quota of $300 million.	
 Fifteen other private equity funds will receive $1.5 billion under the
Qualified Foreign Limited Partner programme, the newspaper said, citing
unidentified sources.	
 
 ISSUES THAT NEED RESOLVING	
 There was modest progress in the regulatory landscape for renminbi funds
last year, including the adoption of the Foreign Invested Partnership Rules,
facilitating foreign PEs entering the foray.	
 There are still many issues that need to be resolved, law firm Morrison &
Foerster said in a paper, including having a qualified foreign limited partner
programme in place to allow foreign limited partners to convert U.S. dollars
into renminbi and giving foreign-invested renminbi funds ""national treatment""
to make investments in industries traditionally restricted from foreign
investment.

483,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2011 06:04AM ET</span>","ANALYSIS-China securities regulator flexes muscle, eyes private equity role"," * Industry faces uncertainty from regulatory turf war
* Private equity firms fear intensive scrutiny over lucrative
sector
* Move a setback for state economic planner NDRC
By Benjamin Kang Lim	
 BEIJING, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Private equity funds in China are nervously
eyeing a push by the country's top securities regulator to gain oversight of
the fast-growing sector, fearing increased scrutiny and tougher new rules.	
 This could be bad news for foreign private equity firms such as Blackstone
Group and Carlyle Group , which are bullish on China but
already have to navigate past a phalanx of regulators.	
 In the wake of the global financial crisis, the question is no longer
whether China's private equity industry needs a single regulator and national
legislation to fill a legal void.	
 Rather, the question now is which agency should have the main
responsibility and the extent of supervision, part of government efforts to
protect investors' interests and curb insider trading, market manipulation and
illegal fund raising.	
 ""It's a turf battle between the National Development and Reform Commission
and the China Securities Regulatory Commission,"" a foreign private equity
executive said, requesting anonymity to avoid repercussions. ""The lack of
transparency is fuelling fears.""	

 The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) surprised the
sector in 2009 with its proposed revisions to the Securities
Investment Funds Law, seen by some as an attempt by the CSRC to muscle its way
into becoming the sector's main regulator.	
 The move was a setback for the state economic planner, the National
Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) -- currently the main private equity
regulator by default -- which had submitted a proposal to the cabinet to win
approval to regulate private equity funds.	
 The cabinet shelved the NDRC proposal after the CSRC argued that
the funds should come under its jurisdiction. The Securities Law supersedes
measures introduced by any government agency.	
 The National People's Congress, or parliament, will soon solicit the views
of a host of regulators as part of its review of the proposed revisions to the
securities law.	
 The NDRC and the CSRC, reached by phone, declined comment.
Shang Fulin, the country's top securities regulator, is behind the
power grab, keen for the CSRC to grow its clout and have the biggest say among
regulators. Other cabinet ministries have quietly complained that the NDRC
wields too much power.
The state planner became China's de facto private equity
regulator after approving the establishment of several government funds.	
 Both foreign and domestic private equity funds have flocked to
""voluntarily register"" with the NDRC to be eligible to receive funding from
the National Social Security Fund, albeit not all applications are accepted.	
 If the CSRC emerges as the main regulator, private equity firms would
still have to ""register"" with the NDRC if they want a slice of the social
security fund pie. With $120 billion in its war chest, the fund is potentially
the largest Limited Partner in China.	

INTENSE SCRUTINY
The industry fears excessive scrutiny by regulators.	
 ""Supervision is needed to prevent unqualified investors from entering this
high risk game, but there is no need for detailed supervision,"" said Frances
Du, managing director of TCY Capital Management Co and author of a book on
venture capital.	
 Uncertainty looms with fears of restrictions on investors and management
companies as well as industries that private equity players can invest in. A
requirement to submit annual, or even quarterly, reports, could make
compliance more complex.	
 The industry's worst nightmare would be a regulatory requirement to make
their investment portfolios public.	
 ""Private equity investors have a strong appetite for risk,"" said Stephen
He, a partner at Beijing Honor Base Law Firm. ""Supervision should be left to
the market.""
China's lucrative private equity landscape attracted 82
China-focused private equity funds to set up last year, according to
Beijing-based fund consultancy Zero2ipo. The funds raised a combined $27.6
billion yuan ($4.2 billion), more than double the $12.96 billion yuan raised
by 30 funds in 2009. [ID:nTOE70904E]	
 Highlighting the attraction, Carlyle last week offloaded a further
$1.8 billion stake in China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co Ltd in what
is on track to be the largest exit ever of a private investment in Asia.
Carlyle's remaining stake is worth around $2.5 billion, having sold
$860 million worth of shares on Dec. 30. Carlyle had paid just $800 million in
a string of investments from 2005 to 2007 for a 15.4 percent stake in China's
third-largest insurer.
The regulatory tussle will not affect the former British colony of
Hong Kong, which reverted to Chinese rule in 1997 and enjoys a degree of
autonomy.
In another snag, the NDRC was forced to defer the ""Temporary
Measures Governing the Registration of Equity Investors in Pilot Areas"", which
were designed to regulate private equity firms in Beijing's Zhongguancun,
Shanghai's Binhai, Wuhan's Donghu and the Yangtze river delta areas, the
Economic Observer daily reported.	
 Wu Xiaoling, vice chairwoman of parliament's financial and economic
affairs committee, sought to placate industry fears when she told the Century
Weekly magazine that the revisions would avoid naming any government body as
the main regulator.	
 But that left the sector still guessing who their overlord will be.

484,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2011 05:56AM ET</span>","UPDATE 1-Eni, BP start recovering costs on Iraqi oilfields"," * Oil companies start to recover costs
 * Exports being boosted

(Adds details, byline, background)
 By Ahmed Rasheed
 BAGHDAD, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Output at Iraq's Zubair oilfield
has reached 265,000 barrels per day, enough to allow oil
companies led by Italy's Eni to start recovering their
investment costs, an Iraqi oil official said on Wednesday.
 The announcement comes a day after officials said production
at the supergiant Rumaila field also would allow developers BP
and China's CNPC to start recovering their costs.
Zubair and Rumaila are among a series of massive oilfields
Iraq auctioned off to international oil firms in 2009. The
contracts could in theory take Iraq's oil capacity to 12 million
bpd, which would rival leading exporter Saudi Arabia.
 The increase in production at the two fields has boosted
Iraq's overall crude output to 2.7 million bpd -- the highest
level in two decades for the war-ravaged nation.
 That has also helped increase exports to an average 2.1
million bpd so far in January, providing much needed growth in
income for Iraq as sectarian bloodshed eases and the country
starts to seek ways to rebuild.
 The service contracts awarded to the companies stipulate
that the firms start to be paid and to recover costs once they
boost production by 10 percent above agreed baselines.
 Zubair's output compares with baseline production of 184,000
bpd.
 Eni, Occidental Petroleum Corp and Korea Gas Corp, working
Zubair, and BP and CNPC developing Rumaila, have passed the
milestone, said Abdul-Mahdy al-Ameedi, head of the oil
ministry's licensing and contracting office.
 ""Both Eni and BP are qualified to retrieve investment
costs,"" Ameedi told Reuters. ""We will pay them this year.""
 Ameedi did not elaborate on the timeframe for payment or
clarify whether the companies were expected to seek payment in
crude or cash.
 Alex Munton of Edinburgh-based consultancy Wood Mackenzie
said the fact BP had exceeded the cost recovery level was very
significant.
 ""It's a key milestone not just in terms of field development
but also project economics. It's the point at which they are
entitled to service fee payments in cost oil and profit oil. It
triggers the start of those payments,"" he said.
 ""Whilst 10 percent reflects good progress over a 12-month
period, BP will actually need to move more quickly than that
over the next five years to get to their plateau target. They'll
be looking at getting around 15 percent per annum.""
 
 RECONSTRUCTION
 Iraq needs hundreds of billions of dollars to fix or replace
shattered infrastructure following eight years of bloodshed
triggered after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and three decades of
economic stagnation before that under Saddam Hussein.
 Iraq's average oil exports so far in January have exceeded
2.1 million bpd, compared with 1.9 million bpd for December, the
head of the State Oil Marketing Organisation said.
 ""If everything moves okay for February and we have good
weather, we will even exceed the 2.1 million barrels and we will
have happy news for Iraqi exports,"" SOMO head Falah Alamri told
reporters, looking ahead.
 Iraq's ability to export much more is constrained, however,
by the dilapidated state of the pipelines to its offshore
terminals in the south, and of the other main export link, the
pipeline from the northern city of Kirkuk to the Turkish port of
Ceyhan.
 Work has started on a project to build new offshore export
terminals and pipelines in the south, and Iraq is pursuing
agreements with neighbouring countries for other pipelines.

 * EADS CEO expects profit to recover from 2012
 * Airbus A380 superjumbo programme ""out of the woods"" -CEO

(Adds EADS CEO comments on profit recovery in paras 11-14)
 By Tim Hepher
 LES MUREAUX, France, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Airbus basked in the
world's biggest commercial plane order on Wednesday, with shares
in parent EADS lifted by news of its $15.6 billion 180 aircraft
deal with Indian airline IndiGo.
 The deal underlines India's development as major aviation
market and comes as a welcome boost to EADS Chief Executive
Louis Gallois, who has been pushing expansion into emerging
markets.
 It also gets an early blow in for Airbus in the annual
battle with U.S. rival Boeing for sales supremacy.
 EADS shares hit a three-year high on the news and had risen
by 2 percent to 20.5 euros by 1111 GMT, after earlier rising by
as much as six percent.
 Indian budget carrier IndiGo's order includes 30 classic
A320s -- Airbus's best-selling model which carries 150 people on
short and medium routes -- and 150 upgraded versions of the same
type of aircraft, called A320neo. IndiGo said it would take
delivery of the first aircraft in 2015 and was considering an
IPO to finance the purchase.
 ""This is suÿrprisingly pos)tive news for us. It is the first
A320neo contract and even the largest contract in history,"" DZ
Bank said in a note.
 However the bank, which has a sell recommendation, said
investors would remain nervous about profitability in the short
term amid European defence cuts and the threat of production
delays to the next Airbus plane, the mid-sized A350, which has a
similar design to the delayed Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
 The deal is the biggest in aviation history by number of
planes with more than 100 seats, Airbus said on Tuesday.
 ""This contract fully validates my conviction that EADS is
worth having among the top picks for 2011. I believe the stock
can still double from here in the next 18 months, one
Paris-based trader said.
 India's aviation sector, which has close to a dozen
carriers, is expanding fast as the booming economy revives the
market for air travel. Indian domestic airlines carried roughly
46.8 million passengers through November last year, compared to
230 million in China a year earlier.
 IndiGo is the third-largest domestic carrier by market share
after less than five years flying. It is owned by InterGlobe
Enterprises and industry veteran Rakesh Gangwal, a former chief
executive of U.S. Airways.
 
 PROFIT TAKING OFF FROM 2012
 Later at the annual EADS news conference Gallois said he
expects profit to recover from 2012 after being held back by
hedging, programme costs and government spending restraint.
 Underlying profitability this year will be in the same range
as the target for 2010, he said.
 Last year, order streams were better than expected and
cashFlow generation was excellent, though operating
profitability was not satisfactory, Gallois said.
 Gallois added that the troubled Airbus A380 superjumbo
programme was ""out of the woods"" and reiterated its target to
start deliveries of its A350 model in the second half of 2013.
 Gallois played down uncertainty over who will succeed him in
his politically sensitive post in 2012, saying this wasn't an
issue at present. The EADS boss is also likely to be quizzed
about progress in a trade dispute with Boeing over mutual
allegations of unfair subsidies.
 EADS was formed in 2000 from a merger of French, German and
Spanish interests in a bid to create a European rival to larger
U.S. giants such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin.
 But it has been rocked by frequent in-fighting over the
Franco-German power balance.
 Secret U.S. cables leaked by the Wikileaks website suggested
tensions over ownership of sensitive technology had resurfaced
inside the company's Astrium space division, which builds the
Ariane 5 space rocket.

* It has already amassed vast stockpile of euro holdings	
* Bulk of its investments are going to safest euro members

By Simon Rabinovitch	
BEIJING, Jan 12 (Reuters) - A record surge in Chinese
currency reserves serves as a timely reminder that its pledge
to buy bonds from indebted European states makes a virtue out
of a necessity.	
So much has been made of Chinese promises to buy Spanish
and Greek debt that somewhere along the way it was forgotten
that euro investments are nothing new for Beijing.	
A $199 billion jump in China's foreign exchange reserves in
the final three months last year, the most ever for a quarter,
dictates that it would need to put upwards of $15 billion a
month into European assets just to maintain its current
portfolio allocation.	
China has been working for years to diversify its official
currency reserves, which now sit at a record $2.85 trillion,
and the euro has been the primary alternative to the dollar,
taking an estimated 25 percent, or about $710 billion.	
""We will over the medium term continue to diversify our FX
reserves, but as reserves increase, U.S. assets will still
form the principal direction for our investments,"" said Zhang
Ming, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
a top government think-tank in Beijing.	
""This is the only feasible option,"" he said. ""There are
still too many risks in Europe.""	
Europe is hardly alone. Other countries have also seen a
marked rise in Chinese cash inflows over the past year as
Beijing scours the earth to find a home for its bulging
reserves.	
It has bought record amounts of Japanese and South Korean
debt, and has also reportedly dipped its toes into Brazilian,
Canadian and Australian issues.	
Given a 25 percent allocation in euros, the overall rise in
China's reserves last year implies that it parked some $100
billion in European assets during that time, with the pace of
investment increasing sharply in recent months.

SAFETY FIRST	
Insofar as China looks to prop up indebted European
countries, a former adviser to the central bank said that it
should buy jointly guaranteed euro zone debt rather than bonds
issued by troubled member states such as Spain and Portugal.	
""In principle we support the euro, but we also need to
ensure that our investment is safe and generates returns,"" Yu
Yongding, an influential economist, told Reuters.
[ID:nBGNBCE77N]	
""I think it's much safer if we buy the fund as it has a
triple-A rating,"" he added.	
While great globs of Chinese cash will likely end up in
German Bunds, the riskier fare will receive only small dollops.	
The 6 billion euros of Spanish debt that China has promised
to buy, according to Spanish daily El Pais, would amount to a
mere 0.27 percent of China's total reserves. [ID:nLDE7050JT]	
Beijing is extremely reluctant to disclose details of any
specific investments, wary of the domestic anger that has
flared up at times over the wisdom of storing so much wealth
in dollars.	
Unsurprisingly, official Chinese media has pedalled a
message of restraint at home about the move into European bonds.	
""It is good to invest in Europe, but the reality for our
country is that we cannot go and solve the problems of the
Europeans,"" said a commentary in the overseas edition of the
People's Daily, the newspaper of the ruling Communist Party.

POLITICAL ECONOMY	
Unofficial estimates described by a senior EU official as
credible suggest that China already holds more than 7 percent
of the 8.8 trillion euros in outstanding euro zone public debt.	
Some of that has no doubt seeped into the more fragile
corners of the single-currency zone. And to what effect?	
""China was presumably already buying a significant amount
of peripheral government bonds last year and yet this has not
prevented their yields from rising sharply, let alone done
anything to tackle the much deeper structural problems in the
euro-zone,"" Julian Jessop and Mark Williams of Capital
Economics wrote in a note last week.	
When Vice Premier Li Keqiang toured Spain last week, as
when Premier Wen Jiabao visited Greece last year, China
calculated that it could use its euro investments to garner at
least some political goodwill.	
Beijing is probably not looking for anything specific in
exchange, but hopes these friendly gestures will nudge the
European Union in the direction of granting it ""market
status"", toning down criticism of its exchange rate regime and
cancelling a ban on weapons sale.	
""Don't think for a moment that China would not use the
bonds to achieve political aims if the need arose,"" said one
China-based European diplomat. ""At the very least we are a
step closer towards the EU lifting its arms embargo.""	
But the crux of China's strategic ambition is far simpler
than that.	
""We don't want to see the euro disappear,"" Xia Bin, an
academic adviser to the central bank, told Reuters.

 By Wojciech Moskwa and Gwladys Fouche
 OSLO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Norway restored production at two
North Sea oilfields on Wednesday, helping boost supplies to a
tight oil market, as its natural gas exports hit record highs
and energy champion Statoil said it is mulling more LNG output.
 The outages at the two fields, which jointly produce some
157,000 barrels per day, had added to worries about global oil
supplies on Tuesday amid problems at a key Alaskan pipeline.
 The news of record gas sales in 2010 comes a day before the
Norwegian Petroleum Directorate gives its annual production
outlook and resource estimates and confirms Norway's decade-long
turn from an oil into a gas-producing nation.
 Norway is still the world's fifth-largest oil exporter but
oil production has dropped by a third since peaking in 2001 to
roughly 2 million bpd. Last year, it overtook Canada as the
world's No. 2 gas exporter after Russia.
 Statoil, Norway's biggest oil company, said its Snorre and
Vigdÿis fields in the North Sea had restarted after a 20-hour
shutdown and would reach full capacity on Wednesday.
 ""The fields are up and running,"" Statoil spokesman Ola
Anders Skauby said on Wednesday. ""We expect full production at

with the rest of the world unexpectedly deteriorated in November
to hit a record high, driven by imports of oil and aircraft,
official data showed on Wednesday.
 The figures will raise concerns about the rebalancing of the
economy towards exports in response to sterling's relative
weakness, as well as casting doubt on the scale of trade's
contribution to fourth-quarter economic growth.
 However, analysts are likely to draw some comfort from the
fact that November's aircraft imports will probably be a
one-off. Britain's trade in goods excluding oil and erratic
items su ch as aircraft -- a better representation of underlying
trends -- narrowed from October's record high.
 The Office for National Statistics said that Britain's goods
trade gap widened to 8.736 billion pounds from an upwardly
revised 8.591 billion pounds in October. This was the biggest
deficit since monthly records began in January 1980, and contr
asts with the narrower deficit of 8.33 billion that economists
had forecast.
 Both exports and imports hit a record high in value terms on
the month, though imports rose faster. The oil balance swung
back from its unusual October surplus of 21 million pound s to a
more typical deficit of 660 million pounds, as imports rose.
 Imports of aircraft and aircraft parts increased by 441
million pounds on the month.
 Britain trade deficit including services also widened. It
increased to 4.123 billion pounds from 4.038 billion, its
highest since August.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - European stocks rose and the euro
was steady on Wednesday after Portugal got through a key bond
auction unscathed and on hopes policymakers will boost a rescue
fund designed for debt-scarred euro zone countries to tap.
 Globally, equities were higher, led by emerging markets and
generally boosted by hopes for a solid earnings season. The
dollar was flat against a basket of major currencies.
 Wall Street also looked set to open higher.
 Investors focused early on Lisbon's first bond auction of
the year, in which it sold the maximum amount it had targeted,
with yields falling on the 10-year issue but rising in the
five-year sector.
 Next in sight is Spain, which is also under scrutiny over
debt servicing. It is seeking to sell up to 3 billion euros of
bonds at an auction on Thursday.
 Markets are keen to see if debt-strapped countries can fund
themselves at a sustainable cost or be forced to turn to the
European Union and IMF for financial aid in the same way that
Ireland and Greece did last year.
 The region's finance ministers are likely next week to
consider the option of raising the effective lending capacity of
the currency bloc's rescue fund as part of efforts to calm
jittery markets.
 ""The auction showed that for the time being Portugal is
still able to access financial markets, if at a price. (But),
the debate will likely remain focused on debt sustainability
issues,"" said Paolo Pizzoli, economist at ING.
 German Bund futures fell to a session low after the auction
as relieved investors unwound some safe-haven positions.
 The euro was flat at $1.267.
 
 STOCKS BUOYANT
 Equity markets were rallying, unfazed by the auction and
lifted by earnings prospects.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 was up nearly 1 percent for a 3.25
percent gain so far this year.
 MSCI's all country world index was up more than half a
percent with its emerging market counterpart gaining 1.3
percent.
 ""(Emerging markets) are benefiting from developments in core
Europe ... there's been some stabilisation with the expectation
that Japan will support the European bond market,"" said
Elisabeth Gruie, emerging markets strategist at BNP Paribas.
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei ended flat after hitting an
eight-month high during the session.

confidence in the region's ability to overcome its debt crisis

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Saikat Chatterjee	
 NEW YORK/HONG KONG, Jan 12 (Reuters) - State-owned Bank of
China Ltd has offered yuan trading to its U.S. customers, a
sign that Beijing this year may increasingly promote the use
of the Chinese currency in major financial centers.	
 The change at Bank of China announced in a posting dated
Dec. 2010 means that customers can trade yuan in
the United States for the first time rather than having to do
so in Hong Kong.	
 However, like elswhere, China is keeping a tight rein on
the yuan allowed to circulate beyond its borders, so
individual accounts can only convert around $3,000 a day into
yuan.	
 The New York branch of China's fourth-largest bank
said it now lets companies and
individuals buy and sell the yuan via accounts with its U.S.
branches, although U.S. businesses and individuals can also
trade the currency through Western banks.	
 ""The authorities are promoting the use of the yuan in
international trade and this is another step in that direction
and this means we should see the growth of yuan trading in
other regional centers across the world,"" said Robert Minikin,
senior currency strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in Hong
Kong.	
 
 The move is seen as another small step to redenominate
trade in yuan after persuading mainland importers and
exporters to reduce settling trade in the U.S. dollar and
striking trade settlement agreements with Russia, Brazil and
other countries.	
 Promoting the use of the Chinese currency in international
trade has gone from strength to strength in the past year
thanks to a slew of measures taken by authorities.	
 Cross-border trade settlement in Hong Kong has grown
rapidly from a monthly average 4 billion yuan in the first
half of 2010 to 68 billion yuan in October. 
 At the same time, Hong Kong's yuan deposit base has
expanded sharply since trade liberalisation rules established
in July 2010, leading to the emergence of a rapidly growing
offshore yuan and yuan-linked instrument market.	
 The step by the Bank of China, while significant, is a baby
one, mainly because the Chinese government still tightly
controls the amount of yuan circulating outside the country
and maintains trade settlement quotas.	
 In 2010, China ran a $181 billion bilateral surplus with
the United States, and a total surplus of $183 billion.	
 Bank of China's website, which outlines details of holding
renminbi accounts, said it offers yuan savings, demand and
time deposit accounts to business customers in New York and
Los Angeles.	
 A savings account requires a minimum balance of the
equivalent of $5,000, while the minimum in demand deposit
accounts is $3,000.	
 The amount of U.S. dollars that can be converted into yuan
per individual account is a tiny 20,000 yuan per day ($3,021)
-- a cap similar to the one existing in Hong Kong -- and means
that the growth in the yuan deposit base would take time.	
 
 SMALL STEPS	
 Yuan deposits in Hong Kong jumped to 280
billion yuan by the end of November from just 63 billion yuan
at the end of 2009, and with the likelihood of more trade
being settled in yuan in other centers, more pools of
liquidity could mushroom.	
 In Singapore, HSBC has started offering yuan deposits to
customers in Singapore with investible assets of more than
200,000 Singapore dollars and DBS will offer yuan deposits to
customers soon.	
 ""Every step has been a small step. It is with small steps
to a more flexible currency, but at their pace and what they
are comfortable with. It is also not a shock that the Chinese
did this just when they are meeting with U.S. officials,"" said
David Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets
in Toronto.	
 Chinese President Hu Jintao will visit Washington to meet
with President Barack Obama on Jan. 19. China's foreign
exchange policy will probably be a topic of discussion

 * China bent on curbing credit but quotas not enough -Li
 * Deputy c.bank governor says monetary policy has limits
(Adds quotes, background)
 BEIJING, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Another Chinese interest rate
increase in the first quarter is likely, a central bank adviser
said on Wednesday, but a vice governor cautioned against raising
rates too steeply for fear of luring in hot money.
 Li Daokui, an academic adviser to the People's Bank of China,
said a rate increase in the first quarter would be reasonable
because inflation tends to be elevated for seasonal reasons
during the opening months of the year.
 ""Generally speaking, prices tend to trend up in the first
quarter, and focusing on such a trend, to make some adjustments
in interest rates is reasonable,"" Li Daokui told reporters at a
forum.
 The central bank, which raised interest rates twice and
increased banks' reserve requirements six times last year, has
promised to put the task of fighting inflation at the top of its
2011 agenda.
 But deputy central bank chief Yi Gang said in published
comments that China should focus on tackling the root cause of
inflation by cutting the trade surplus rather than relying too
much on monetary policy to fight inflation.
 Yi said the origin of China's inflation pressure lies in the
country's huge trade surplus, which exerts pressure on the yuan
to appreciate.
 Chinese officials have warned that monetary policy will be
less effective because of excessive liquidity in global financial
markets stemming from monetary easing in the United States.
 Raising interest rates would curb inflation but it would also
attract hot money inflows into China, where required bank reserve
ratios have already been lifted to historic highs, Yi told the
official Shanghai Securities News.
 PRESSURE
 The pressure on the central bank to contain liquidity is
evident after data showed a record $199 billion surge in foreign
exchange reserves in the fourth quarter to $2.85 trillion.
 The central bank has to buy most of the incoming foreign
currency to keep the yuan stable, pumping out huge amounts of
local currency into the banking system as a result.
 It has been sterilising such funds by issuing bills and
raising banks' reserve requirements, and Xia Bin, another central
bank adviser, said the PBOC has done a good job in the area.
 Although it was true that money issuance had been fast last
year, the extent should not be exaggerated because the central
bank was controlling it through sterilisation, Xia said.
 Li said the government does want to rein in bank lending, but
that setting a full-year credit quota by itself was insufficient.
 ""China's economic structure is complicated today, so it is
not sufficient to only set a lending target this year to control
the economic performance,"" Li said.
 In the past, China used loan quotas to keep a handle on
lending. This year, the central bank has pledged to refine that
system with regular calibrations of reserve requirements and
capital ratios targeted to individual lenders.
 Banks lent 7.95 trillion yuan ($1.2 trillion) in 2010,
overshooting Beijing's target of 7.5 trillion yuan, highlighting
the need for more decisive policy tightening.
 Banks extended a further 600 billion yuan in new loans in the
first week of 2011, and lending in January could hit 1 trillion
yuan, Caijing magazine reported on Wednesday.

 By Andrei Khalip	
 LISBON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Portugal is likely to pay
record high premiums to place debt on Wednesday, but recent
bond buying by the European Central Bank should avert a
dramatic rise in yields to levels that prompt the country to
seek a bailout.	
 The heavily-indebted Iberian country faces the bond
markets for the first time in 2011 and needs to convince
investors that it can keep financing itself without seeking EU
financial aid or provoking a contagion that affects the much
bigger economy of neighbouring Spain.	
 Portugal is widely seen as the next euro zone weakling
that will need a financial bailout following in the wake of
Greece and Ireland. [ID:nLDE706084]	
 Caution over the auction and a debt sale due on Thursday
by Spain capped the euro against the dollar in Asian
trade as investors waited to see what yields investors would
demand to risk their capital. [ID:nTOE70B01Q]	
 The yield on Portugal's 10-year bond rose to
a euro lifetime high of 7.3 percent in the secondary market on
Friday. But it came come down to just below 7 percent at
Tuesday's close, with traders citing ECB purchases.	
 On Wednesday, Portugal is to offer a total of between 750
million euros ($972.1 million) and 1.25 billion euros in four-
and 10-year bonds.	
 ""The market will take it down primarily because of what
the ECB is doing. The ECB appears to be proactive enough and
we've seen tightening in Portuguese yields so far this week,""
said Peter Chatwell, rate strategist at Credit Agricole in
London.	
 Still, the borrowing costs should hit a new euro lifetime
auction record of around 7 percent for the 10-year bond, up
from 6.806 percent in the previous sale in November.	
 Bonds maturing in October 2014 yield 5.81
percent in the secondary market, up from 4.04 percent in the
previous auction in October.	
 ""Growing yields in the auctions all add to longer-term
concerns about debt and liquidity, but it's not like it's
going to be a make-or-break auction,"" said Chatwell.	
 BNP Paribas analyst Ioannis Sokos said he was not worried
about demand at the auction or the yields after the ECB buying.	
 ""I expect the auction to be already sold, with domestic
demand enough to cover supply, but it doesn't mean that
concerns will go away ... The next big test will be the
syndication placement and peer pressure on Portugal to take
aid,"" he said.	
 The country plans to launch a new bond worth at least 3
billion euros via a banking syndicate in the first quarter.	
 Traders said the ECB was active in the debt market on
Tuesday buying Portuguese bonds as part of a plan to stabilise
volatile peripheral debt markets. [ID:nLDE70A1ZC]	
 Even if Portugal's debt auction is successful on
Wednesday, markets will focus on how long the country can
maintain such borrowing levels.	
 ""Portugal is a dead man walking really, it's just a matter
of time,"" Alan McQuaid, chief economist at Bloxham
Stockbrokers in Dublin, said on Tuesday.	
 ""You might have a successful auction but the point is how
long can you sustain those bond yields? Every month it's going
to go higher and higher."" 
 A senior euro zone source said at the weekend that
pressure is growing on Portugal from Germany and France to
seek financial help from the European Union and International
Monetary Fund.	
 Both countries have denied any pressure and Germany also
said European Union aid for Portugal is not on the agenda of
next Monday's meeting of finance ministers from the bloc.	
 Portugal's Prime Minister Jose Socrates has repeatedly
denied any intention of seeking a bailout and is focusing on
cutting the budget deficit and on measures, such as boosting
exports, to raise economic growth.	
 Analysts say the question for Portugal is how long it can
afford to finance itself at current high rates, particularly
in view of a 4.5 billion euros bond redemption due in April.	
 ""The current situation is not sustainable forever,"" said
Filipe Silva, debt manager at Banco Carregosa in Porto.	
 Spain is also expected to pay a hefty premium to sell up
to 3 billion euros of 5-year bonds on Thursday. 
 In Italy, the euro zone periphery's most liquid debt
market, yields rose to a two-year peak on Tuesday.	
 Investor concerns over Portugal focus on its ability to
rein in its debts and create sustainable economic growth.	
 The minority Socialist government's austerity drive,
including 5 percent wage cuts for civil servants and tax
hikes, aims to cut the budget deficit to 4.6 percent of gross
domestic product this year. 
 The government said on Tuesday it beat last year's 7.3
percent budget deficit goal.	
 But the central bank said the austerity will throw the
economy back into recession after estimated growth of 1.3
percent last year [ID:nLDE70A12S]. That would make budget
targets harder to meet and possibly stir opposition to
spending cuts. Unions held a general strike late last year.

 By Chris Buckley	
 BEIJING, Jan 12 (Reuters) - China would welcome assurance
about the security of its financial assets in the United
States, a senior diplomat said on Wednesday ahead of President
Hu Jintao's visit next week, while playing down rifts between
the two powers.	
 Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Cui Tiankai said North Korea
and other issues that need cooperation between two global
giants would come up during Hu's Jan. 18-21 trip. Hu will have
a summit with President Barack Obama on Jan. 19.	
 While Obama may press Hu on China's yuan currency
controls, Cui said Beijing had its own concerns about its big
holdings of U.S. treasury debt.	
 China has amassed the world's biggest stockpile of foreign
exchange reserves at $2.85 trillion, an estimated two-thirds
of which is invested in U.S. assets.	
 ""Regarding the security of China's assets in the United
States, if the U.S. side can offer a positive statement on
that then of course we'd welcome that, and it's an issue we're
paying attention to,"" Cui told reporters.	
 China regularly seeks assurances on the security of its
U.S. investments before any formal high-level meetings with
the United States.	
 Indeed, for two years running, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao
has used the most important press conference of the year
during the annual parliament to say he is worried about the
safety of China's investments in the United States.	
 The politically sensitive trade gap between the world's
two biggest economies widened by 26 percent in 2010 to $181
billion in China's favour, Chinese data showed this week.	
 The growing gap provides fodder for critics of Beijing's
tightly controlled currency regime who claim China keeps the
yuan cheap to give its exporters an unfair advantage.	
 The briefing on Hu's trip, which touched on a series of
sensitive economic and defense issues for the two countries,
came as U.S. Defense Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was
wrapping up a visit in China intended to defuse military
tensions.	
 Cui said differences in national conditions and
development levels meant China and the United States could not
avoid differing views and friction.	
 ""This is normal,"" he said. ""If we had no dealings with
each other, then there would also be no friction.""	
 But Cui said China shares ""broad common interests and
goals"" with the United States on Korean peninsula issues, and
repeated calls to restart six-party nuclear talks.	
 On Tuesday, Gates said North Korea could have
inter-continental ballistic missiles within five years, and
that the country posed a direct threat to the United States.
[ID:nTOE70A07X]	
 Obama is likely to urge Hu to increase pressure on North
Korea, which triggered regional alarm by shelling a South
Korean island and by claiming progress in uranium enrichment,
which could give it a second pathway to making nuclear weapons.	
 China also conducted its first test flight of a stealth
fighter jet on Tuesday, a move China said was not connected to
Gates's visit. [ID:nL3E7CB1IO]	
 ""I think China's rise in national power and China's
expansion of international influence is an objective fact,""
Cui said, but added this could promote relations with the U.S.
and other countries.	
 ""No other country has reason to feel worried or troubled
about this. What you've raised (about the stealth fighter) had
nothing to do with Defense Secretary Gates's visit or with
China-U.S. relations,"" he said.

 The change at Bank of China announced in a posting dated
Dec. 2010 means that customers can trade in yuan in
the United States for the first time rather than having to do
so in Hong Kong. 
 The New York branch of China's fourth-largest bank said it
now lets companies and individuals buy and sell the yuan via
accounts with its U.S. branches, although U.S. businesses and
individuals can also trade the currency through Western banks.	
 ""The authorities are promoting the use of the yuan in
international trade and this is another step in that direction
and this means we should see the growth of yuan trading in
other regional centers across the world,"" said Robert Minikin,
senior currency strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in Hong
Kong.	
 The move is seen as another small step to redenominate
trade in yuan after persuading mainland importers and
exporters to reduce settling trade in the U.S. dollar and
striking trade settlement agreements with Russia, Brazil and
other countries.

 These efforts have paid off with the yuan deposit base
expanding sharply since the July 2010 trade liberalisation
rules leading to the emergence of an offshore yuan and
yuan-linked instrument market in Hong Kong.	
 
 SMALL STEPS	
 Yuan deposits in Hong Kong jumped to 280 billion yuan by
the end of November from just 63 billion yuan at the end of
2009, and with the likelihood of more trade being settled in
yuan in other centers, more pools of liquidity could mushroom.	
 In Singapore, HSBC has started offering yuan deposits to
customers in Singapore with investible assets of more than
200,000 Singapore dollars and DBS will offer yuan deposits to
customers soon.	
 ""Every step has been a small step. It is with small steps
to a more flexible currency, but at their pace and what they
are comfortable with. It is also not a shock that the Chinese
did this just when they are meeting with U.S. officials,"" said
David Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets
in Toronto.	
 While this would bolster trade settlement in yuan, it
still has a long way to go before it assumes the status of an
alternative reserve currency as Chinese policymakers
ultimately control the yuan liquidity taps in offshore markets
and investing in mainland assets is still strictly controlled.	
 The move comes before a scheduled visit to Washington by
Chinese President Hu Jintao for a summit on Jan. 19.
[ID:nL3E7CA05U].	
 The bank's website, which outlines details of holding
renminbi accounts, said the bank offers yuan savings, demand
deposit and time deposit accounts to business customers in New
York and Los Angeles.	
 A savings account requires a minimum balance of the
equivalent of $5,000, while the minimum in demand deposit
accounts is $3,000.

 * Portuguese bond sale eyed, followed by Spanish auction
 * Aussie down on worries over floods' impact on growth
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The euro made thin gains on
Wednesday, extending this week's rebound but with limited ability
to rise much as caution gripped the market ahead of debt sales by
highly indebted euro zone countries.
 Portugal is due to tap bond investors on Wednesday while
Spain is seeking to sell up to 3 billion euros ($3.89 billion)
worth on Thursday. Markets are keen to see if they can obtain
funding at a sustainable cost or if they will be forced to turn
to the European Union and IMF for help.
 ""If Portugal has to pay over 7 percent it will be inevitable
for it to ask for help,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 For now though the common currency is enjoying a reprieve
after euro zone sources said the region's finance ministers are
likely next week to consider the option of raising the effective
lending capacity of the currency bloc's rescue fund as part of
efforts to calm jittery markets.
 This follows Japan's promise to support an upcoming euro zone
bond sale and talk that the European Central Bank had bought debt
to help stabilise markets.
 The common currency gained 0.2 percent on the day to reclaim
the $1.30 level, edging up further from a four-month trough of
around $1.2860 hit on Monday.
 The dollar's weakness against Asian and other emerging
economy currencies is indirectly helping the euro, a U.S. bank
trader said.
 Attempts to take out stop-loss orders said to be lurking
above $1.30 were countered by offers by an Asian central bank,
traders said.
 Further resistance is seen at its Dec. 23 low of $1.3055 and
the 200-day moving average around $1.3070, and many traders see
little chance of the euro rising above those levels in the near
term.
 BNP Paribas strategists said in a report that they expect the
euro's rise to remain limited to $1.3000/40, which would provide
renewed selling opportunities with a target for a break below
$1.2875 and then $1.2590.
 The immediate focus is on Wednesday's debt sale by Portugal,
widely seen as the next euro zone weakling to seek a bailout
after Greece and Ireland.
 Lisbon will likely need to offer record high premiums to
place its debt, although recent bond buying by the European
Central Bank has helped drive down the yield on Portugal's
benchmark 10-year bond to below 7 percent from euro lifetime
highs of 7.3 percent last week.
 Against the yen, the single European currency rose 0.3
percent to 108.35 yen, well off four-month lows around 106.81 set
on Monday.
 As the euro recovered, the dollar index, which tracks the
performance of the greenback against a basket of major
currencies, slipped 0.2 percent to 80.63, off a five-week high
around 81.313 set on Monday.
 Versus the yen, the dollar was little moved at 83.27 yen,
though it held well above this week's low around 82.66, with
gains in global stocks weighing on demand for the yen.
 Meanwhile, the Australian dollar hit a fresh one-month low
around $0.9803, though option triggers at $0.98 helped it limp
back to $0.9860.
 Mounting worries that massive floods in northeast Australia
could hamper growth were taking a toll on the Aussie, knocking it
further from a 28-year high around $1.0250 set on Dec. 31.
 Warwick McKibbin, a Reserve Bank of Australia board member,
was quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald as saying the floods
could cut economic growth by up to 1 percentage point.
 Estimates by other economists were less grim, though, with
many expecting the floods could at most knock 0.5 percentage
point off growth.

 By Nick Macfie	
 SINGAPORE, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The euro rose weakly against
the dollar on Wednesday while Asian stocks edged higher, but
investors were increasingly nervous ahead of a key bond sale
by ailing euro zone member Portugal later in the day.	
 Eyes are on Lisbon's first debt auction of the year, when
it is due to tap bond investors for around 1.5 billion euros,
while Spain is seeking up to 3 billion euros on Thursday.	
 Markets are keen to see if they will be able to fund
themselves at a sustainable cost or be forced to turn to the
European Union and IMF for financial aid.	
 But the common currency still enjoyed some reprieve after
euro zone sources said the region's finance ministers were
likely next week to consider the option of raising the
effective lending capacity of the currency bloc's rescue fund
as part of efforts to calm jittery markets. [ID:nLDE70A1RM]	
 This followed Japan's promise to support an upcoming euro
zone bond sale and talk that the European Central Bank bought
debt to help stabilise markets.	
 The euro was trading around $1.2986 to the dollar.
On Monday, the euro plumbed a four-month trough around $1.2871.	
 
""The Portuguese (debt) auction will probably go quite well
and that'll likely give the euro a bump up ... temporarily,""
said Joseph Capurso, a strategist at Commonwealth Bank, late
on Tuesday. 
""The bottom line is they're going to be paying something
like 7 percent on their 10-year debt and that's probably more
than they can afford. There is a very high chance they'll have
to seek some sort of assistance from European partners and
that'll push the euro back down again.""	
 Asian shares were flat to slightly higher on the back of
gains on Wall Street and solid U.S. earnings reports, with
Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei index up 0.15 percent. The
MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks ex-Japan was
up 0.52 percent.	
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.3 percent
on Tuesday, and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index added
0.4 percent. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.3
percent.	
 Brent crude prices  stayed near $98, the highest
level since October 2008, as production shutdowns in Norway
and Alaska raised expectations of an accelerated tightening of
supplies in Atlantic basin, Middle East and Asia-Pacific oil
markets.	
 Gold rose more than $4 to $1,384.80 an ounce, below
its historical high of around $1,430 struck in December but
still buoyed by high oil prices and the euro zone crisis, both
of which help promote gold's image as a safe haven.	
 Dealers said gold could rise further as demand from
jewellers and investors picks up in India and China, leading
to tighter stocks for gold bars in Singapore and Hong Kong.
Premiums for gold bars are at two-year highs. 
 Worries about inflation in China, the world's
second-largest gold consumer after India, drove investors to
gold, while purchases from jewellers are also rising ahead of
the Lunar New Year in February , a traditional period
for giving gifts.

 * Yi Gang: raising rates would attract more fund inflows
(Adds comments)
 SHANGHAI, Jan 12 (Reuters) - China should focus on increasing
domestic demand and rebalancing its economy rather than relying
too much on monetary policy to fight inflation, central bank
Deputy Governor Yi Gang said in remarks published on
Wednesday.
 Yi told a state-affiliated magazine that monetary policy
options were likely to be less effective amid excessive liquidity
in the global financial markets.
 While there has been some impact from a series of monetary
and administrative policy actions China took in the face of the
Federal Reserve's latest round of monetary easing, dubbed QE2,
the potential role of such policies was becoming more limited, Yi
told the official Shanghai Securities News.
 He said raising interest rates would curb inflation but it
would also attract hot money inflows into China, where required
bank reserve ratios have already been lifted to historic highs.
 Capital controls would work in the short term, but their
effectiveness would weaken over the long term, Yi added.
 More than just an economic issue, rapid money and credit
growth has become a political concern, helping propel Chinese
consumer inflation to its fastest in more than two years. Data
showed on Tuesday that China overshot its bank loan target in
2010. [ID:nTOE70A04N]
 Determined to rein in rising prices, a source of public
discontent, the government declared late last year that it would
shift to a tighter monetary policy stance.
 The People's Bank of China, which has raised interest rates
twice and increased banks' reserve requirements six times since
the start of last year, has promised to put the task of fighting
inflation at the top of its 2011 agenda. 
 Yi said the origin of China's inflation pressure lies in the
country's huge trade surplus, which exerts pressure on the yuan
to appreciate.
 He said the key to countering the impact of the Fed's QE2 is
to boost domestic consumption, restructure the economy, reduce
its trade surplus and rebalance its economy.

 * ""Real, demonstrative commitment"" sought from China
 * U.S.: Pace, conviction key to showing Beijing's resolve
 * Geithner to lay out vision for economic goals of summit
 By Emily Kaiser and Caren Bohan
 WASHINGTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - The United States wants a
""real, demonstrative commitment"" from China that it is serious
about shifting away from export-led economic growth, a U.S.
official told Reuters on Tuesday ahead of next week's state
visit by China's Hu Jintao.
 Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner will on Wednesday lay
out his vision for how the world's two biggest economic powers
should interact. But the official's comments indicate some
impatience with China's gradual approach to allowing its
currency to rise and building up domestic demand.
 ""It's both the pace in which they do it and the conviction
with which they demonstrate they're going to do it,"" said the
senior Obama administration official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
 ""What we still need to see in the first instance is that
real, demonstrable commitment to the objective"" of rebalancing
the economy, the official said.
 Washington has pressed Beijing for years to allow the yuan
to rise more rapidly to cool its exports, narrow a trade gap,
and shrink a $2.8 trillion pile of reserves.
 But China counters that U.S. economic policies are
responsible for the imbalances and has urged the United States
to get its own fiscal house in order before its mountain of
debt destabilizes the global economy.
 The Jan. 19 White House talks mark the first face-to-face
meeting between President Barack Obama and Hu since the Group
of 20 summit in Seoul in November, which was widely seen as a
disappointment for Washington.
 Not only did Obama get scant international support at the
G20 meeting for pressuring China to speed up the yuan's rise,
but he also got an earful from allies about his own country's
economic policy. Topping the list of complaints was the U.S.
Federal Reserve's decision to buy $600 billion in government
debt to try to spur a stronger economic recovery.
 Eswar Prasad, a Brookings Institution economist and former
International Monetary Fund official with responsibility for
China, said Geithner's speech would seek to wrest back control
of the economic message.
 ""There is a sense that at the Seoul G20 summit, China
managed to take charge of the narrative, especially about the
effects of (the Fed's bond-buying program) on the rest of the
world, thereby deflecting attention from yuan and trade
policy,"" Prasad said.
 PRESSURE EASES
 Geithner is the first of several top U.S. officials fanning
out to preview Hu's visit and detail the White House's aims.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will give what an aide
called a ""major"" address on U.S.-China relations on Friday.
 Geithner will ""stake out the expectations and make the
point that the U.S. thinks now is the time to address issues
that are contributing to global imbalances and hurting the
recovery in the United States,"" said Adam Hersh, an economist
at the Center for American Progress think tank.
 Hersh said Geithner would likely try to convey a
cooperative tone because of a recognition that taking too hard
a line would pose obstacles to solving shared problems.
 But Obama is keen to show that China is not dominating the
relationship, a perception that has plagued him since a 2009
visit to Beijing that critics said yielded little for the
United States.
 The administration official said next week's meeting was
part of an ongoing dialogue with China, and continuing those
regular contacts would help develop mutual trust needed to make
progress on economic and political issues, ranging from North
Korea to human rights.
 Both countries understand they have a role to play in
rebalancing the global economy, and both sides would benefit
from getting it right, he said.
 ""It's not done so we can win and they can lose,"" the
official said. ""There's a deep conviction on our side that this
will benefit China as well.""
 Geithner has made a similar argument, telling China that it
needs to let the yuan strengthen more in order to quell
inflation and prevent disastrous asset price bubbles.
 Since mid-June, when China announced it was loosening its
grip on the yuan, the currency has risen about 3 percent
against the dollar.
 However, Prasad pointed out that the real effective
exchange rate had risen even more when taking into account the
difference between U.S. and Chinese inflation rates.
 That, along with big U.S. congressional gains by
Republicans who are less inclined to press China over its
currency, give Geithner some breathing space and allows Obama
to focus on long-term strategic issues, Prasad said.
 The administration official said bilateral visits were
about keeping up momentum rather than coming up with big
headline-grabbing agreements.
 ""I don't think this should be seen somehow as a dramatic
moment. It's more part of the building of an important
relationship and nurturing of that relationship,"" he said.

 TORONTO, Jan 11 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar
strengthened against the U.S. currency on Tuesday, as higher
commodity prices and a firmer euro increased investors' risk
appetite and helped extend the currency's run above parity with
the greenback.

 ""It's fairly broadly consistent with what we're seeing from
other commodity producers,"" said Mark Chandler, who heads RBC

 The Canadian dollar  finished 0.35 percent higher
at C$0.9897 to the U.S. dollar, or $1.0104, up from Monday's
North American finish of C$0.9932 to the U.S. dollar, or

there's some risk on sentiment. Oil is higher, equities are

 NEW YORK, Jan 11 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Tuesday on
speculation that euro-zone officials could raise the effective
lending capacity of the bloc's rescue fund while a surge in
oil prices pushed U.S. energy stocks higher.
 Crude oil prices climbed above $91 a barrel as a key
Alaskan pipeline remained shut and on colder weather, lifting
shares of energy producers but limiting gains of
transportation and consumer-related stocks.
 The euro also got a lift from talk of increased Portuguese
bond buying by the European Central Bank and Japan's pledge to
buy about 20 percent of the bonds to be jointly issued later
this month to raise funds to support euro-zone periphery
countries.
 The possibility of increasing the actual capacity of the
European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) to a full 440
billion euros, from around 250 billion, could be part of moves
aimed at calming fears over the severity of the region's debt
crisis. [ID:nLDE70A1RM]
 But investors remained cautious ahead of a make-or-break
debt auction in struggling Portugal on Wednesday.
 The auction will signal whether the indebted country will
be able to afford to raise funds in the debt market or be
forced to take a bailout. Spain will follow suit on Thursday.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices slipped on Tuesday ahead of
re-opened 10- and 30-year bond sale this week. Gold rose for a
second day on rising demand before China's Lunar New Year in
early February, while thermal coal prices rose to a year high

 The S&P Energy Index <.GSPE> rose 1.6 percent, but
transportation stocks and consumer names softened as a 2

 ""There's a big feeling we're going to have $100 barrel oil

Advisors in Boynton Beach, Florida.
 He said that is clearly bullish for the sector, but oil
above $90 a barrel could ""take disposable income away from the

 AUCTIONS COMING UP
 The single currency was up 0.22 percent at $1.2970 
by late afternoon in New York trade ahead of Portugal's sale
on Wednesday of 1.25 billion euros of bonds. This auction is
seen as a critical test as to whether the indebted country is
able to raise funds in the debt market or be forced to take a

 The premium that investors demand to hold bonds issued by
Spain, Italy and Portugal, rather than low-risk German Bunds,
reversed earlier widening, with traders citing the European
Central Bank's bond buying.
 Portugal's prime minister and finance minister said on
Tuesday that Portugal has no plans to seek a bailout, and the

 * Mexican peso gains 0.6 pct, Chilean peso up 0.6 pct
 * Brazil's real dips 0.06 pct as intervention fears weigh
(Adds comments, updates prices)
 By Samantha Pearson and Michael O'Boyle
 SAO PAULO/MEXICO CITY, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Mexico's peso
jumped to an 8-month high on Tuesday, helped by surprisingly
strong local industrial output data.
 Chile's currency firmed after rising copper prices helped
reverse some of the recent losses from a central bank
intervention launched last week, while Brazil's currency was
held back by concerns of further meddling in markets.
 The Mexican currency  strengthened 0.6 percent to
12.1400 per dollar, hitting its strongest level since April of
last year, helped by data that showed local factories were
gaining momentum at the end of 2010 as U.S. demand picked up.
[ID:nN11130858]
 ""It seems that industrial production continues to do well
and domestic consumption is picking up,"" said Benito Berber, an
economist at Nomura in New York.
 The Mexican currency was poised to post an over two-year
high if it firms a bit past 12.13 per dollar.
 Berber said the peso could have some trouble breaking past
option barriers around 12.10 per dollar. However, if the
currency pierces that level, the peso could quickly firm past
12 per dollar.
 ""The forecasts that are calling for the peso to trade below
12 per dollar are likely to be reached in the first quarter,""
Berber said.
 In the short term, other analysts said that too many
investors may have piled into the Mexican peso trade, too
quickly, leaving the currency open to profit-taking in the
short term.
 ""The Mexican trade is pretty crowded,"" said Flavia
Cattan-Naslausky, a strategist at RBS Securities in New York.
""We need to take a breather here before we take another move.""
 INTERVENTION LOOMS
 Brazil's real underperformed Latin American currencies on
Tuesday as the threat of more aggressive intervention in the
Brazilian market weighed on the real , which bid only
0.06 percent stronger at 1.685 per dollar.
 Brazil's finance minister, Guido Mantega, said Monday he
was sure the country's currency would not strengthen further,
adding that intervention via so-called reverse swaps in the
futures market would carry little financial risk.
[ID:nN10282474]
 If reverse swaps are used, the real could weaken to
1.75-1.77 per dollar, according to one New York-based head
currency trader.
 The government has taken a number of measures to try to put
the brakes on the real's recent gains, including a new reserve
requirement on banks' short U.S. dollar positions.
 ""Mantega's threats went largely ignored by the market,
though he is making it quite clear that policymakers will fight
very hard against any further BRL appreciation,"" said Nick
Chamie of RBC in a research note.
 The Chilean peso  firmed 0.6 percent to 496.50 per
dollar, helped by higher prices for copper, the country's main
export.
 ""The peso's performance here is mainly following what is
going on abroad,"" said Rodrigo Sarria, a trader at Celfin
Capital in Santiago.
 ""We have copper going up, so we should see the market here
trying to test new levels. We could see corrections between 15
and 18 pesos in the next few days, which would be half of how
much the peso fell following intervention,"" he added.
 Chile's peso slumped last week after the central bank
announced a massive dollar-buying plan to curb its strength.

(Updates prices)
 NEW YORK, Jan 11 (Reuters) - The euro rallied on Tuesday on
speculation euro zone officials could raise the effective
lending capacity of the bloc's rescue fund and on talk of
increased Portuguese bond buying by the European Central Bank.
 The euro climbed closer to $1.30 as the New York session
wound down but analysts cautioned it could easily resume its
downward trend given nervousness over a heavy schedule of debt
issuance by southern European countries this week.
 A critical test for the euro will come on Wednesday when
Portugal is scheduled to sell up to 1.25 billion euros of bonds
in an auction that will signal whether the indebted country
will be able to afford to raise funds in the debt market or be
forced to take a bailout.
 ""Given that there are a lot of issues still unsettled with
the European debt crisis, which is likely to continue for many
months, there's always going to be pressure on the euro,"" said
Ihab Salib, senior portfolio manager and head of international
fixed-income at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh. 
 Federated Investors manages about $341.3 billion in assets.
Salib oversees more than $3 billion.
 The euro last traded up 0.2 percent at $1.2980, having
risen as high as $1.2994 on trading platform EBS.
 Euro resistance is at its 200-day moving average of $1.3072
while support is around $1.2794, the 61.8 percent Fibonacci
retracement of a June-to-November rally.
 Traders still expect the euro to retest its four-month low
around $1.2875 set on Monday, with a break likely opening the
door to a drop towards $1.2645 and $1.2590 in the coming
weeks.
 Finance ministers are likely to consider next week the
option of raising the effective lending capacity of the euro
zone rescue fund as part of efforts to calm sovereign debt
markets.
 Market talk of increased Portuguese bond buying by the
European Central Bank added to the euro's luster in the New
York session.
 The euro earlier also found support after Japan said it
will purchase euro zone bonds to bolster confidence in the
European Financial Stability Facility but in a volatile session
momentum faded after Tokyo said it would use existing euro
reserves to pay for the debt.
 Tokyo's pledge came after China assured Spain it would
invest in the indebted euro zone state's bonds -- an assurance
whose impact also proved fleeting.
 ""The support (from Japan) looks set to come from existing
euro reserves, so it will not form an increase in the
allocation of the euro,"" said Mary Nicola, currency strategist
at BNP Paribas in New York. ""In fact, if it's a reallocation
away from the peripheral bond markets to the EFSF bonds, then
it could prove to be euro negative.""

Tuesday Portugal has no plans to seek a bailout, and the

 Analysts said the euro could see a relief rally once the
three bond auctions were out of the way, though if borrowing
costs stayed high any gains would be temporary.
 The dollar rose 0.6 percent to 83.22 yen as recent optimism
about the U.S. economy helped lift bond yields. The Swiss
franc extended the prior day's sell-off amid growing concern
about the impact of the record-strong franc on the domestic
economy. The dollar hit a one-month high of 0.9784 Swiss franc
on EBS.

 WASHINGTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - The United States should not
press China for an immediate sharp rise in the value of its
yuan currency because that could be bad for both countries, the
leader of a top U.S. business group said on Tuesday.
 ""While the currency thing is a real challenge, if we were
to force the Chinese to adjust, they would simply drop the
price of the products and that would have a more negative
effect,"" U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue said
in an interview with Reuters Insider.
 ""The issue on the currency should be done in an
evolutionary way. It should continue to happen, but a
revolutionary change in currency will probably not help either
party,"" Donohue said.
 U.S. concern over China's currency practices are expected
to be high on the agenda when Chinese President Hu Jintao
visits Washington next week.
 Many U.S. lawmakers believe China keeps the yuan
undervalued by 15 percent to 40 percent to give its companies
an unfair price advantage in international trade.
 Beijing has argued that a rapid rise in the value of the
yuan could create economic instability without having a major
effect toward reducing the huge U.S. trade deficit with China.
It has urged patience, while letting the yuan rise about 3
percent in value since mid-June.
 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has opposed efforts in the
U.S. Congress to pass legislation to deal with the issue,
fearing it could spur Chinese retaliation.
 In a speech earlier on Tuesday, Donohue said China needed
to make more progress soon on the currency issue and a number
of other trade concerns.
 ""But starting a trade war with one of our fastest growing
exports markets is not the answer,"" Dohohue said.
 Donohue said said other trade concerns are ""in many ways
more important"" than China's currency practices.
 Those include China's lax intellectual property protections
and discriminatory indigenous innovation policies that favor
domestic companies at the expense of foreign ones, he said.

 NEW YORK, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Global stocks gained on
Tuesday as better-than-expected earnings lifted Wall Street
while the euro erased early losses against the dollar as talk
of the European Central Bank may buy Portuguese bonds buoyed
the single currency.
 Japan said it was considering buying about 20 percent of
the bonds to be jointly issued later this month to raise funds
to support euro-zone periphery countries.
 But investors remained cautious ahead of a make-or-break
debt auction in struggling Portugal on Wednesday.
 The auction will signal whether the indebted country will
be able to afford to raise funds in the debt market or be
forced to take a bailout. Spain will follow suit on Thursday.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices slipped on Tuesday ahead of the
auction of $66 billion in new government bonds this week, while
oil climbed above $91 a barrel as a key Alaskan pipeline
remained shut.
 Gold rose for a second day on rising demand before China's
Lunar New Year in early February, while thermal coal prices

 European shares rose to a near 28-month closing high and
U.S. stocks advanced as U.S. fourth-quarter earnings exceeded
expectations with forecast-beating results from U.S. aluminum
major Alcoa , and higher outlooks from several
retailers.
 At midday in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> had climbed 59.03 points, or 0.51 percent, to 11,696.48.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> gained 6.74 points, or

sessions of declines. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC>
rose 13.20 points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,721.00.
 ""All the leading indicators are pointing towards a positive
earnings season once again,"" said Lothar Mentel, chief
investment officer at Octopus Investments in London, adding
that markets could push higher ""as long as the positive results
are accompanied by half-decent outlooks.""
 Both Sears Holding Corp  and Tiffany & Co 
raised their profit outlooks, citing strong sales.
[ID:nN0550793] and [ID:nN11108814]
 ""Along with Alcoa, these raised outlooks suggest a
stronger-than-expected season ahead,"" said said Adam Sarhan,

 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> shot up
0.71 percent, with emerging markets index <.MSCIEF> gaining
0.76 percent, while Japan's Nikkei closed down 0.3 percent.
 Analysts said the prospect of solid corporate earnings was
generally giving stock investors the room to look past euro-
zone debt concerns for the time being.
 Meanwhile, U.S. wholesale inventories unexpectedly fell 0.2
percent in November to a seasonally adjusted $425.5 billion as
wholesale sales outstripped forecasts, a government report
showed on Tuesday, suggesting optimism about the sustainability
of demand.
 The stronger-than-expected sales and the fall in
inventories implied that demand during the holiday shopping
season may have been greater than retailers had anticipated.
 AUCTION AHEAD
 Japan pledged to buy euro-zone bonds this month in a show
of support for Europe's debt struggle but market players
doubted the gesture would offer the euro much relief.
 The single currency was up 0.24 percent at $1.2972 
by early afternoon in New York trade amid talk of increased
Portuguese bond buying by the European Central Bank.
 The premium investors demand to hold bonds issued by Spain,
Italy and Portugal, rather than low-risk German Bunds, reversed

 (Adds safety authority, background on production)
 By Wojciech Moskwa
 OSLO, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Norway's oil and gas producer
Statoil said its Snorre and Vigdis fields in the North Sea were
shut on Tuesday after a gas leak, further denting global oil
output after an outage of a key Alaskan pipeline.
 The North Sea fields -- which jointly produce about 157,000
barrels per day (bpd) -- were shut after gas leaked into the air
on the Snorre A platform during a well shutdown.
 ""We still don't know when we will restart the fields,"" a
Statoil spokesman said. ""We hope to get production back soon.""
 Norway's Petroleum Safety Authority (PSA) said Statoil had
stopped the gas leak and ""normalised"" the safety situation
around 6 a.m. (0500 GMT) after the leak started at 3.38 a.m.
 ""We assume its a rather big leak but can't confirm it so
far,"" PSA spokeswoman Inger Anda said. ""As always, a hydrocarbon
leak in a production area is very serious. Statoil has started
an internal investigation and we have also asked for a meeting.""
 The 800-mile (1,280-km) Trans Alaska Pipeline, which carries
oil from Alaska's North Slope, was closed after a leak was
discovered on Saturday, shutting in flows equivalent to 12
percent of U.S. crude output. 
 U.S. oil prices climbed above $90 per barrel on Tuesday as
the Alaskan pipeline remained shut, removing more than half a
million barrels per day from U.S. markets. According to the
Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD), Snorre produces some
116,000 bpd of oil along with small amounts of natural gas and
natural gas liquids.
 Vigdis, whose oil is piped to the Snorre A platform,
produces some 41,000 bpd of oil, the NPD said.
 Norwegian broadcaster NRK said platform workers spent
several hours in lifeboats after the gas leak alarm sounded.
 Norway prides itself on being a reliable supplier of oil and
gas but its fields have been dogged by outages in past months,
forcing the country's energy champion Statoil to cut its
production guidance. North Sea oil output is seen rising by
4.8 percent next month to above 2 million barrels per day, but
over the course of 2011 oil production offshore Norway is
expected to decline yet again as oilfields mature.

545,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2011 12:00PM ET</span>",China urges easing of EU high-tech export controls," LONDON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - China urged Britain on Tuesday to
lobby for an easing of European Union controls on high-tech
exports to China.
 ""We hope our British colleagues can help urge the European
Union to relax its restrictions on high-tech exports to China,""
international trade representative Gao Hucheng told a trade
forum organised by the China-Britain Business Council.
 Gao is among a 50-strong delegation accompanying Chinese
Vice Premier Li Keqiang on a four-day visit to Britain that ends
on Wednesday.
 The 27-nation EU restricts high-tech exports to China and
maintains a 21-year-old ban on selling weapons to China, imposed
after a bloody crackdown on student protesters in and around
Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.
 China wants access to high-tech components to speed its move
into higher-value-added manufacturing. Western business
executives often voice concern about what they see as the
inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in China.
 China's reduction in export quotas for rare earth minerals,
of which it is the biggest producer and which are used in the
production of many high-tech products, has alarmed its trading
partners.
 Chinese companies have signed billions of dollars of
business deals during the tour of Britain, Spain and Germany by
Li, who is widely tipped to become China's next premier.
 Britain, eager for closer business ties with China and other
emerging market giants, announced 2.6 billion pounds ($4
billion) of business deals with China on Monday.
 Gao said the Chinese economy was showing ""more positive
signs of consolidation and growth"" and consumer spending was
growing very rapidly. Internationally, uncertainties over growth
were increasing, he said.
 ""This year the Chinese government will continue to implement
a pro-active fiscal policy and a moderately easy monetary
policy,"" he said, speaking through an interpreter.
 Gao said China would try to establish a fairer and more
transparent environment for investors, adding that Beijing
attached great importance to the protection of intellectual
property rights.
 He said China was committed to creating a more open and
accommodating investment climate and would continue to open up
financial services and services outsourcing, and encourage
foreign direct investment in high-tech industries and high-end
manufacturing, energy and environmental services.

 * Sees 2011 industry profits at $8 bln vs $17 bln in 2010
 * Market share fight could knock profits below forecast
 * Global container fleet to grow 8.5 percent in 2011
 
 By John Acher
 COPENHAGEN, Jan 11 (Reuters) - A fight for market share
between container shipping lines is denting rates and profits,
and a lack of capacity discipline could knock earnings below
current estimates, shipping consultants Drewry said.
 The global shipping industry rebounded in 2010 from a dismal
year in 2009 when the economic crisis hit trade, cargo volumes
and freight rates.
 But Drewry sees container shippers' collective profits
dropping to around $8 billion this year from an estimated $17
billion in 2010, still a rebound from losses of $19.5 billion in
2009, it said in a Jan. 11 glimpse of its new Container
Forecaster analysis.
 ""This (2011 profitability) could be considerably lower if
carriers' pricing and capacity discipline weakens further,""
Drewry said in a statement.
 Maersk Line, owned by Danish shipping and oil group A.P.
Moller-Maersk, is the world's biggest container shipper.
 Major rivals include privately owned Switzerland-based
Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), French privately held
CMA-CGM, China's COSCO, Korea's Hanjin Shipping, Taiwan's
Evergreen Marine and others.
 Freight rates have come off peaks seen around August 2010,
which will pull earnings back towards more normal levels this
year from last year's strong results, London-based Drewry said.
 ""2009 was a horrendous year for the industry when a couple
of carriers should have gone under but didn't,"" Neil Dekker,
editor of Drewry's container forecast, told Reuters on Tuesday.
 ""The rebound in 2010 was surprisingly strong -- I don't
think anyone foresaw the demand rebound in the early part of the
year -- and because of carriers' discipline on the supply side,
they got a lot of rate increases through and did extremely
well,"" Dekker said.
 But capacity discipline has weakened. Towards the end of
2010 carriers did not withdraw capacity from the market which
could have helped them bolster rates, he said.
 ""If you look at Asia-Europe (trade), the net result is that
most carriers tried for a general rate increase on January 1,
and that has pretty much failed and existing rates have been
extended into January,"" Dekker said.
 He said that the forecast 2011 earnings drop was ""fairly
significant,"" but added: ""In the grand scheme of things, we
would project that operating profit margins for carriers would
be around 5-6 percent and that is historically about average.""
 Several carriers had revived shipbuilding despite still
tighter financing, Drewry said, and it projected that the global
container fleet would grow by 8.5 percent in 2011.
 It forecast that average east-west freight rates would fall
by 7 percent this year after a strong rebound in 2010.
 ""The fear is what carriers will do on the capacity front,""
Dekker said, adding that looming in the background are a number
of ships of 10,000 12,000 and 13,000 TEU (twenty-foot equivalent
units) due to be delivered.
 ""We estimate roughly 50 ships this year,"" he said. ""We think
there will be question marks over the supply-demand balance in
the Asia-Europe trade.""
 ""But that does not mean the industry is going to fall off a
cliff, it just won't be as good in a comparative perspective.""

 By Manuela Badawy and Jeremy Gaunt
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - World stocks rose on
Tuesday on hopes for a solid U.S. earnings season, while the
euro slipped against the dollar after Japan's pledge to buy
euro zone bonds failed to calm renewed fears of a sovereign
debt crisis.
 Japan said it was considering buying about 20 percent of
the bonds to be jointly issued later this month to raise funds
to support Ireland, but momentum in the euro's climb faded
after Tokyo said it would use existing euro reserves to pay for
the debt. For details, see [ID:nL3E7CB076]
 Investors were also cautious ahead of a make-or-break debt
auction by struggling Portugal that will signal whether it will
be able to afford to raise funds in the debt market or be
forced to take a bailout. Spain will follow suit on Thursday.
 U.S. Treasury prices were lower ahead of the $66 billion in
new government bond sales this week, while oil climbed above
$90 a barrel as a key Alaskan pipeline remained shut. Gold rose
for a second day on rising demand ahead from China.
 Wall Street opened higher as the fourth-quarter earnings
season started with forecast-beating results from aluminum
maker Alcoa Inc , and higher outlooks from retailers.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> advanced 63.84
points, or 0.55 percent, at 11,701.29. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 7.32 points, or 0.58 percent, at
1,277.07. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> rose 11.18 points,
or 0.41 percent, at 2,718.98.
 ""The fact that Alcoa did so well sets the tone for the rest
of the season,"" said Malcolm Polley, president and chief
investment officer of Stewart Capital Advisors in Indiana,
Pennsylvania.
 Both Sears Holding Corp  and Tiffany & Co 
raised their profit forecasts, citing strong sales.
[ID:nN0550793] and [ID:nN11108814]
 ""Along with Alcoa, these raised outlooks suggest a
stronger-than-expected season ahead,"" said Adam Sarhan, chief
executive at the New York-based Sarhan Capital.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> gained 1.4 percent. World
stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were up 0.7 percent
with emerging markets <.MSCIEF> adding 0.8 percent. Japan's
Nikkei closed down 0.3 percent.
 Analysts said the prospect of solid U.S. corporate earnings
gave stock investors the room to look past euro zone debt
concerns for the time being.
 ""The focus is switching to companies' results this week,
with earnings due from big U.S. names such as JPMorgan ,
but the euro zone debt fears will remain in the backdrop and
could continue to weigh on banking stocks,"" said Geraud
Missonnier, trader at Saxo Banque in Paris.
 In the latest economic data, U.S. wholesale inventories
unexpectedly fell in November as wholesale sales outstripped
forecasts, the government reported, suggesting optimism about
the sustainability of demand. [ID:nN11122103]
 The stronger-than-expected sales and the fall in
inventories implied that demand during the holiday shopping
season may have been greater than retailers had anticipated.
 SHOW OF SUPPORT
 Japan pledged to buy euro zone bonds this month in a show
of support for Europe's debt struggle, but market players
doubted the gesture would offer the euro much relief.
 The euro  was down 0.19 percent at $1.2916 after
rising as high as $1.2992 on trading platform EBS, but the
focus was on this week's heavy schedule of debt issuance by
southern European countries, starting with Portugal.
 The dollar gained against a basket of major currencies,
with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> edged up 0.23 percent at
81.071.
 On Wednesday, Portugal is scheduled to sell up to 1.25
billion euros of bonds in an auction that will signal whether
the indebted country can afford to raise funds in the debt
market or be forced to take a bailout.
 Portugal's prime minister and finance minister both said
the government has no plans to seek a bailout, and the
government was doing everything possible to avoid one.
[ID:nLDE70A0V5]
 Italy and Spain are due to tap the bond market on Thursday
in auctions that will also be closely watched for any sign of
troubled debt contagion. [ID:nLDE7061KW]
 The premium that investors demand to hold bonds issued by
Spain, Italy and Portugal, rather than low-risk German Bunds,
reversed earlier, widening with traders citing European Central
Bank bond buying.
 U.S. government bonds were lower ahead of the auctions as
dealers shorted Treasuries to prepare for the sale before
buying back the debt in the auctions.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 9/32, with the yield at 3.3221 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  eased 1/32, with the yield at 0.585
percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  fell 18/32,
with the yield at 4.4964 percent.
 The U.S. Treasury will sell $66 billion in new supply this
week, including $32 billion in three-year notes on Tuesday, $21
billion in reopened 10-year notes on Wednesday, and $13 billion
in reopened 30-year bonds on Thursday.
 In energy and commodities prices, U.S. light sweet crude
oil  rose $1.23, or 1.4 percent, to $90.48 per barrel,
but a source told Reuters the Trans Alaska Pipeline was still
expected to restart this week after a spill on Saturday forced
it to shut down, idling 12 percent of U.S. oil production.
 Spot gold prices  were up $2.04, or 0.15 percent, to
$1,376.50 an ounce as last week's price decline encouraged an
improvement in consumer demand in China, pushing premiums for
gold bars to their highest in two years.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Jan 11 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against the
dollar on Tuesday with more losses expected after a pledge by
Japan to buy euro zone bonds failed to calm fears of a
sovereign debt crisis spreading to Portugal and Spain.
 The euro had earlier climbed near $1.30 after Japan said it
will purchase euro zone bonds to bolster confidence in the
European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), but gains faded
after Tokyo said it would use existing euro reserves to pay for
the debt.
 A critical test for the euro will come on Wednesday when
Portugal is scheduled to sell up to 1.25 billion euros of bonds
in an auction that will signal whether the indebted country
will be able to afford to raise funds in the debt market or be
forced to take a bailout.
 ""The support (from Japan) looks set to come from existing
euro reserves, so it will not form an increase in the
allocation of the euro,"" said Mary Nicola, currency strategist
at BNP Paribas in New York. ""In fact, if it's a reallocation
away from the peripheral bond markets to the EFSF bonds, then
it could prove to be euro negative.
 ""We are expecting to retest yesterday's $1.2875 low, and a
break below here could trigger a further euro/dollar decline
toward $1.2645 and $1.2590 in the coming weeks,"" she added.
 Tokyo's pledge came after China assured Spain it would
invest in the indebted euro zone state's bonds -- an assurance
whose impact also proved fleeting.
 The euro last traded down 0.2 percent at $1.2917, having
risen as high as $1.2992 on trading platform EBS.
 Resistance is at its 200-day moving average of $1.3072
while support is around $1.2794, the 61.8 Fibonacci percent
retracement of a June-to-November rally.
 The euro rose 0.4 percent to 107.51 yen from a four-month
low of 106.75 yen set on Monday. It gained 0.6 percent to
1.2607 Swiss francs.
 AUCTIONS IN FOCUS
 The euro could easily resume its downward path given
mounting unease over a heavy schedule of debt issuance by
southern European countries this week, analysts said.
 Markets have already pushed the 10-year Portuguese yield to
punishingly high levels above 7 percent.
 Portugal's prime minister and finance minister said on
Tuesday Portugal has no plans to seek a bailout, and the
government was doing everything possible to avoid doing so.
 Italy and Spain are also due to tap the bond market on
Thursday, in auctions that will also be closely watched for any
sign of contagion.
 Analysts said the euro could see a relief rally once the
three bond auctions were out of the way, though if borrowing
costs stayed high any gains would be temporary as attention
would turn to when a call for outside assistance might come.
 ""The euro may see a bounce -- a knee-jerk one -- if these
auctions see a good bid-to-cover ratio,"" said Jeremy Stretch,
head of currency strategy at CIBC World Markets. ""But success
will come at a price.""
 The dollar rose 0.6 percent on the day to 83.01 yen,
supported by Japanese importers' bids.
 The Australian dollar shed more than 1 percent to a
one-month low of $0.9820, on speculation that more flooding in
the country may dent its economic growth.

 * Irrigation reservoirs 75.8 percent full
* Total reserves 84 percent above 10-yr average
 
 MADRID, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Spain's capacity to generate
hydro power and grow crops leaped after heavy rain last week,
the latest data showed on Tuesday in a development that may
reduce the country's hefty import bill for gas and grain.
 Reservoirs held enough water to produce 15,142
gigawatt-hours of electricity, the Ministry for the Environment
and Rural Affairs said in a weekly bulletin, or 1,028 GWh more
than last week.
 By itself, that would be enough to supply Spain's average
electricity needs for 21.25 days, given annual demand data from
national grid operator REE of 260,000 GWh.
 Hydro reserves are now 45 percent above the 10-year average
after 2010 was a wetter year than usual, a factor which
undermined gas consumption by keeping gas-fired generators on
standby.
 When costly gas-fired plants lie idle, wholesale electricity
prices tend to fall and affect revenues for utilities such as
Iberdrola, Endesa, Gas Natural and Hidrocantabrico. 
 Spain imports more than 99 percent of the 38 billion cubic
metres of gas it burns every year, mostly in the form of
liquefied natural gas, of which it is the world's third-biggest
importer.
 
 HEAVY RAIN
 Rainfall recorded by the ministry for the week to Jan. 9 was
80.7 percent above the historical average at 26.2 millimetres,
which was enough to hoist total water stocks to 84 percent above
the 10-year average.
 Reservoirs set aside for agricultural use, including
irrigation, are up to 75.8 percent of capacity from 74.8 percent
a week ago.
 Crops such as maize need irrigation to be grown in
drought-prone Spain, which seeks to ease its dependence on grain
imports that come to at least 10 million tonnes a year.
Spanish farmers say rainfall so far in the 2010/11 crop
campaign has been sufficient for sowing winter wheat and barley.

 Other irrigated crops in Spain include rice, cotton and
alfalfa, which is a key ingredient in animal feed and also
produced for export.

554,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2011 09:36AM ET</span>",BOE FOCUS-Higher rates loom as BoE's credibility questioned," * British inflation highest in G7
 * Investors demand premium for future inflation risks
 * Markets move to price in two UK rate hikes this year
 
 By Christina Fincher
 LONDON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Concern the Bank of England has
lost its grip on inflation has risen to such a level that
markets are increasingly pricing in an interest rate rise by the
summer to prevent a full-blown credibility crisis.
 British inflation has surged to a six-month high of 3.3
percent -- well above that of any other G7 country -- and looks
set to hit 4 percent early this year, double the target.
 The consumer price inflation measure has exceeded the 2.0
percent target for most of the last three years and the broader
retail price inflation measure is even higher at 4.7 percent.
 Industry groups fear that louder mutterings about the
central bank's credibility could drive it to tighten policy
before a fragile economic recovery warrants it, particularly
with harsh government spending cuts about to bite.
 ""If you tell a central bank it has lost credibility, you
almost invite it to overreact,"" said David Kern, chief economist
at the British Chambers of Commerce.
 Pressure is mounting, however, in financial markets where
investors are losing faith in the BoE's assessment that prices
are being driven up simply by temporary factors.
 Since the start of this year, benchmark gilt yields
 have risen even as yields on German and French
government bonds  have fallen.
 Even more worryingly for the BoE, gilt breakeven rates --
the yield gap between conventional and inflation-protected
government bonds -- have soared, reflecting growing fears that
the central bank will struggle to bring inflation back down.
 Five-year gilt breakeven rates have jumped 50 basis points
in little over a month, double the rise in French breakeven
rates and far more than the 35 basis point rise seen in the U.S.
Treasuries market.
 ""We're coming to a point where the Bank of England will have
to take action to restore its credibility,"" said Henderson chief
economist Simon Ward.
 ""If it doesn't, it is risking a pick-up in wage settlements,
downward pressure on sterling and a loss of credibility that
could have a serious cost to the economy.""
 
 CREDIBILITY QUESTION
 Once lost, credibility for a central bank is hard to recover
and some on the BoE's monetary policy committee must surely feel
uncomfortable about recent market moves.
 Andrew Sentance has so far been a lone committee member
calling for higher interest rates but it is possible that one or
more of his eight colleagues will join him at the BoE's monthly
meeting which ends on Thursday.
 Investors are warming to that view that a rate rise by the
middle of the year is now a distinct possibility.
 Economists are playing catch-up. A Reuters poll early last
week found a median still forecasting no rate rise until the
last quarter of the year [BOE/INT] but the picture is changing
rapidly.
 Citi changed its rate call on Friday to predict two rate
rises from the BoE this year.
 BNP Paribas, which had forecast no tightening this year, now
expects a third quarter rate rise, and maybe an even earlier
move, while Societe Generale analysts have brought forward their
expectation of a first rate hike to August.
 ""The challenge now is to ensure that the inflation upturn
does not develop into a crisis of surging inflation
expectations,"" said Michael Saunders, UK economist at Citi.
 The shift in market expectations has been even more
dramatic. 
 Last October, investors believed rates would stay at 0.5
throughout 2011 and the debate was about whether further
stimulus was needed. Now, money market rates are pricing a rate
rise to 0.75 percent by July and 1 percent by the end of the
year.
 
 FORECASTING FAILURE?
 Inflation has been above the BoE's 2 percent target more
than 75 percent of the time for the last three years and the
central bank's line about one-off shocks is starting to ring
hollow.
 Serious questions are being asked about the central bank's
forecasting process, particularly its reliance on estimates of
the output gap -- a measure of slack in the economy which can be
taken up without generating inflation -- and its belief that
slow broad money growth precludes sustained price pressures.
 Although rising commodity prices have led to a resurgence of
price pressures across much of the world, the credibility issue
for the Bank of England is particularly acute.
 In the euro zone inflation has only just broken through the
European Central Bank's 2 percent comfort ceiling while in the
United States it is running at little over 1 percent. 
 Henderson's Ward, who has been an outspoken critic of the
BoE's forecasting methods, says the central bank is
over-estimating both the extent of the output gap and its
disinflationary impact.
 ""Increasing globalisation means the sensitivity of inflation
to the domestic output gap has fallen considerably since the
last recession of the 1990s,"" said Ward. ""It would make more
sense for the BoE to be focusing on the output gap of the global
economy.""
 The BoE's poor track record has even raised suspicions that
it is deliberately turning a blind eye to inflation to give a
tailwind to the recovery, a charge it has vehemently denied. But
it may need to take action quickly to prevent a loss of
credibility turning into an unfortunate legacy of mistrust.

 By Joachim Dagenborg
 OSLO, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Norway hopes to iron out a
free-trade agreement with China during 2011, its trade and
industry minister said on Tuesday after a $2 billion sale of a
Norwegian silicon producer to a Chinese company.
""We have the ambition to land the trade deal during 2011,""
Trond Giske told Reuters.
 Diplomats have said a free trade deal between Norway and
China could serve as a blueprint for a potential trade agreement
between China and the European Union. Norway is not an EU
member.
 Beijing has been furious at Norway since the Norwegian Nobel
Committee awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to Chinese
dissident Liu Xiaobo in October, and has indefinitely postponed
the next negotiating round in trade talks with Oslo.
 ""We're in a continuous dialogue with the Chinese, but it's
not been decided when the next round of talks will take place,""
Giske said in an interview.
 ""We're in a tough phase of the negotiations, where we'll
have to bring down tariffs. Both sides must make concessions to
make the deal really substantive.""
 Giske has said the $2 billion sale by Norwegian conglomerate
Orkla of its Elkem unit to China National BlueStar would
hopefully mark a return to ""business as usual"" between the two
states.
 Fast-growing China is keen on importing energy and
technology from Norway, one of the world's biggest exporters of
oil and natural gas with ample experience in offshore drilling.

 By Naomi Tajitsu and Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - The euro pared gains made on
Tuesday as investors were sceptical a pledge by Japan to buy
bonds planned by a European rescue fund would result in fresh
buying in the single currency.
 Investors initially saw Tokyo's promise to buy the bonds as
a show of support for Europe's struggle to tame its debt crisis.
The bonds are expected to be issued by the European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF) later this month, and will be used to
finance Ireland's bailout plan.
 But Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda's suggestion that Japan
would use euro cash holdings to buy the bonds dampened some of
the initial excitement from traders who thought the move might
involve fresh buying of the European currency. [ID:nL3E7CB076].
 As a result, the euro was unable to hold on to initial gains
made on the announcement, analysts said.
 ""The market sees it as a reallocation of existing euros,
rather than fresh net buying,"" said Chris Turner, currency
strategist at ING.
 ""It's encouraging in a way, but the EFSF is well capitalised
and the debt is triple A, so there was never really a concern
that they would have any problems issuing the debt.""
 Tokyo's pledge came after China assured Spain it would
invest in the indebted euro zone state's bonds -- an assurance
whose impact also proved fleeting.
 The euro last traded at $1.2940 , unchanged from late
New York levels, having risen as high as $1.2992 after Noda's
comments. Resistance is at its 200-day moving average of $1.3072
while support is at $1.2794, the 61.8 percent retracement of a
June-to-November rally.
 Given mounting unease over a heavy schedule of debt issuance
by southern European countries this week, the euro could easily
resume its downward path, analysts said. 
 
 FOCUS ON PORTUGAL
 The focus this week is on a Wednesday debt auction that will
signal whether Portugal will be able to afford to raise funds in
the debt market or be forced to turn to the European Union and
International Monetary Fund for financial aid.
 Markets have already pushed the 10-year Portuguese yield to
punishingly high levels above 7 percent .
 Portugal's prime minister and finance minister said on
Tuesday Portugal has no plans to seek a bailout, and the
government was doing everything possible to avoid doing so.
[ID:nLDE70A0V5]
 Italy and Spain are also due to tap the bond market on
Thursday, in auctions that will also be closely watched for any
sign of contagion. [ID:nLDE7061KW].
 Analysts said the euro could gain once the three bond
auctions were out of the way, though if borrowing costs stayed
high any gains would be temporary as attention would turn to
when a call for outside assistance might come.
 ""The euro may see a bounce -- a knee-jerk one -- if these
auctions see a good bid-to-cover ratio,"" said Jeremy Stretch,
head of currency strategy at CIBC World Markets. ""But success
will come at a price.""
 The euro climbed on the crosses, rising to 107.86 yen
 from a four-month low of 106.83 yen set on Monday. It
gained 0.2 percent to 1.2530 Swiss francs .
 The dollar index <=USD> <.DXY>, was flat at 80.890, while
the dollar rose 0.3 percent on the day to 82.98 yen ,
supported by Japanese importers' bids.
 The Australian dollar  shed more than 1 percent to a
one-month low of $0.9820, on speculation that more floods in the
country may dent its economic growth.
 The Swedish crown rallied to a seven-year high versus the
euro of 8.8770 crowns per euro , as investors
continue to flock to the crown due to Sweden's economic strength
and healthy fiscal position.

560,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2011 07:28AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Hungary watchdog proposes switch to EUR-based loans,"* Banks should offer swapping Swiss franc loans to euro-PSZAF
* Conversion is ""no silver bullet"" for non payment -banks
* Higher interest rates could make EUR payments high too -OTP
 
(Adds OTP Bank comment in paras 12-13)
 BUDAPEST, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Hungary's banks should offer
borrowers the option of converting Swiss franc-denominated
household loans into euro-based ones to dampen exchange rate
volatility, financial watchdog PSZAF said on Tuesday.
 Hungarian households' large stock of foreign currency
denominated loans, nearly half of which is in Swiss francs, has
become a sticky problem for borrowers, banks and policy makers
and is a key vulnerability for the country.
Spokesman Istvan Binder told state television m1 that PSZAF
had sent a letter to bank executives on Friday in which it
outlined the reasons and benefits of such a conversion.
 The Swiss franc was trading near record highs against the
forint on Monday, boosting the costs of debt servicing for
ordinary consumers across a country that was forced to seek IMF
aid during the financial crisis. 
 ""The last few years have shown that the Swiss franc has been
much more volatile against the forint than the euro has been,
posing a problem for people who hold franc-denominated loans,""
Binder said.
 The switch would also benefit banks, as the steadier EUR/HUF
exchange rate leads to fewer non-paying clients, Binder said.
 ""We do not propose immediately exchanging loans, rather for
banks to develop products that incentivise conversion,"" he said.
Non-performing loan rates have reached 10.6 percent among
households and 12.7 percent among companies by September 2010,
the National Bank of Hungary has said, pointing to the franc's
gains as a chief reason behind the rise.
 The Hungarian Banking Association said it would consider the
PSZAF proposal, but added that many banks already offer the
option to switch currencies that loans are denominated in.
 ""It is one of the tools we use to try and help borrowers,""
Banking Association spokesman Janos Muller said. ""Banks use it
more and more often. However, the circle of clients for whom
this solution is applicable is rather limited.""
 ""There is no silver bullet to eradicate non-payments,"" he
added. ""This conversion idea isn't one either.""
 Hungary's OTP Bank, emerging Europe's largest independent
lender, said in an emailed statement that it offered the option
to switch already and very few clients had taken it, adding that
the move might not result in lower payments.
 ""Although the CHF and EUR interest rates have come very near
one another, on the long run the differential is more likely to
return to average levels, resulting in a higher interest burden
for clients who switch to euros,"" OTP said.
 Analysts also warned that exchanging the loans now would
lock in recent losses as the franc has also traded near record
highs against the euro.
 ""Now that the franc is near record highs against the euro it
would not be ideal to exchange the loans,"" Concorde Securities
analyst Attila Gyurcsik said. ""I would make it available for
clients, though.""
""Somewhere around EUR/CHF at 1.35 and CHF/HUF at 200 it
would make sense for many people to make the switch,"" he added.
 ""A switch like that would raise lots of questions that
would have to be regulated carefully for the euro switch to be
realistic. Interest rates, foremost, would have to take EURIBOR
as a benchmark, with a sensibly set spread.""

 * Small gains seen in Indian rupee, Russian rouble
 * Brazilian real to weaken slightly on dollar strength
 
 By Kevin Yao and Samantha Pearson
 BEIJING/SAO PAULO, Jan 11 (Reuters) - China is likely to let
its tightly controlled yuan appreciate at a faster clip this
year as part of heightened efforts to quell inflation, a Reuters
poll showed on Tuesday.
 The yuan is expected to hit 6.3 per dollar by the end of
2011, a rise of 5.4 percent from Monday's spot rate, compared
with last year's 3.6 percent annual rise, according to the poll
conducted ahead of President Hu Jintao's visit to Washington
next week.
 The currencies of India and Russia will appreciate modestly
over the next 12 months, while the Brazilian real is expected to
weaken slightly, according to median predictions from more than
30 analysts.
 With economic power shifting to the emerging world, the BRIC
nations have assumed ever-greater importance. China is also
inviting South Africa, Africa's top economy, to join the club.
 China, the world's second-largest economy, is under pressure
from its trading partners to allow a faster rise in the yuan.
 Beijing will nudge the yuan up 0.6 percent in the next
month, 1.3 percent in the next three months and 2.4 percent in
the next six months, the poll of more than 40 economists and
strategists showed.
 The poll reinforced the perception that the government is
tolerating faster yuan rises to help put a lid on inflation,
which raced to a 28-month high of 5.1 percent in November.
 ""China's inflation is accelerating, and a stronger exchange
rate along with higher interest rates is needed to bring about
tighter financial conditions and more sustainable growth,"" said
Jonathan Cavenagh, currency strategist at Westpac in Singapore.
 ""Chinese growth is still expected to remain robust and this
leaves room for further currency strength to help the process of
gradual orientation of growth away from the external sector to
internal sources.""
 Rich-world policymakers say China keeps its currency
undervalued to give its exporters an unfair advantage. U.S.
President Barack Obama, seeking to boost exports and stimulate
job growth, is expected to push Hu to let the yuan rise more
quickly.
 But data on Monday showed China's trade surplus narrowed in
2010 for the second straight year, giving Beijing grounds to
rebuff such calls.
 The analysts polled by Reuters are seemingly more bullish on
the yuan than investors. Benchmark one-year offshore
non-deliverable forwards imply a 2.8 percent rise in the yuan
against the dollar over the coming 12 months.
 China said in June it would make the yuan more flexible when
it unshackled the currency from a two-year dollar peg, but it
has been treading cautiously despite heavier foreign pressure.
 China allowed the yuan to gain about 7 percent annually
between July 2005, when the currency was formally depegged from
the dollar, and July 2008, when the quasi-fixed link was
restored to help Chinese exporters weather the global storm.
 
 REAL DOWN
 Analysts expected the Brazilian real, considered one of the
most overvalued currencies in the world after gaining about 50
percent since the end of 2008, to weaken to 1.7 per dollar by
the end of 2011 from 1.69 currently.
 Ever-richer consumers have driven Brazilian domestic growth
while the country's high interest rates have attracted floods of
foreign capital to its bond market.
 Those factors should continue to support the real in 2011.
In fact, interest rates could get even higher as policymakers
fight to control inflation after it sped up to a six-year high
last month.
 However, as Brazil's booming economy settles into a more
sustainable pace of growth and developed markets become more
attractive again, the real may not be such a great bet.
 ""The United States has been slowly recovering, and this will
probably result in an appreciation of the dollar, which will
consequently cause the real to depreciate here,"" says Reginaldo
Galhardo, head of currency trading at the Treviso brokerage in
Sao Paulo.
 Analysts saw the partially convertible Indian rupee at 43.50
per dollar by the end of 2011, which would be an appreciation of
4 percent from Tuesday's level of around 45.3.
 ""Although the dollar is expected to stay steady to positive
through short/medium term, strong rupee fundamentals will deplug
its traction with dollar move against euro,"" said J. Moses
Harding, head of global markets at IndusInd Bank.
 ""So I will stay with expectations of 3-5 percent
appreciation on the year for the rupee.""
 The Russian rouble was also seen closing the year slightly
stronger at 29.8 to the dollar, or a rise of around 3 percent in
2011 from 30.6 on Tuesday.

 * Says will allow greater rouble flexibility
 * Capital flows outlook vague
 
 MOSCOW, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Russia may continue tightening
monetary policy while allowing more exchange rate flexibility in
2011 as it faces high inflationary risks and uncertainty in
capital flows, a senior central bank official said.
 ""Inflationary risks are high enough, it is likely that we
will see some statistical rise in inflation,"" First Deputy
Chairman Alexei Ulyukayev told Prime Tass agency in an interview
published on Tuesday.
 ""I hope the situation ... will stabilise by the end of the
first -- the beginning of the second quarter"".
 In 2010 Russia's consumer price inflation exceeded official
forecasts by coming in at 8.7 percent, which in late December
prompted a hike in deposit rates by the central bank. The bank
pledges to keep prices under control as it moves towards
inflation targeting.
 ""In the end of 2010 we made a step, showing our concerns
about inflationary risks are no less than about growth risks,
but even greater,"" Ulyukayev said.
 He said it was not excluded that the central bank will
further change interest rates this year.
 As inflation becomes a greater priority, the central bank
has been scaling down foreign exchange interventions, something
it is expected to continue doing. Ulyukayev reiterated that it
may also further widen the rouble's floating corridor, now
located at 33.0-37.0 versus the euro-dollar basket.
 ""I do not exclude that in the first half of the year we will
again revise quantitative parameters of our actions,"" Ulyukayev
said.
 The central bank's future steps will depend on the global
environment and local factors, such as capital flows, that
feature ""very high degree of uncertainty"" in 2011, he said.
 ""We may see a continuation of some capital outflow, but we
can also see an inflow, moreover the inflow could be quite big.""
 In 2010, Russia saw capital outflows of around $30 billion,
according to earlier central bank estimates. However, a state
privatisation programme worth some $32 billion and increased
merger and acquisition activity is expected to change the
balance of capital flows.
 Russia is also continuing to diversify its reserves, the
world's third largest, and in 2010 started purchasing Canadian
dollars. Ulyukayev said the Canadian unit now accounts for 1
percent of the forex part of the cash pile, while 47 percent is
held in U.S. dollars, 41 percent in euros, 9 percent in sterling
and 2 percent in Japanese yen.
 Ulyukayev reiterated that Russia will begin ""operations""
with the Australian dollar in 2011, and plans to continue
increasing gold's share of reserves from the current 7 percent.
 Ulyukayev also said that a 7.58 stake of Sberbank, the
country's biggest lender, could be put on sale by the end of
2011 or in early 2012.

 BERLIN/HAMBURG, Jan 11 (Reuters) - German authorities said
on Tuesday the highly toxic chemical dioxin had been discovered
in pork in addition to poultry products, which would expand the
range of a current health alert.
 German and European Union authorities are dealing with an
alert that began on Jan. 3, when German officials said
dioxin-tainted feed had been fed to hens and pigs, contaminating
eggs and poultry meat at the affected farms.
 Authorities in the northern state of Lower Saxony said on
Tuesday that pork from one pig farm had show dioxin levels above
permitted levels and that several hundred pigs on the farm had
been slaughtered and the meat disposed of.
 Samples of pig meat on another farm had shown dioxin levels
at around permitted levels, the state said.
 Prosecutors in Germany are investigating the cause of the
contamination and specifically whether animal feed additive
company Harles and Jentzsch distributed fatty acids meant for
industrial paper production to animal feed processors.
 EU officials said on Monday some tainted animal feed had
been exported to France and Denmark. South Korea has restricted
imports from Germany because of the affair, and Russia has said
it may also take action.
 On Tuesday German officials are due to brief their EU
counterparts in Brussels on the latest developments and are
likely to face questions on the root cause of the incident and
their response to it. A German parliament committee is also due
to discuss tougher safety controls on the animal feed industry.
 Dioxins are formed by burning waste and through other
industrial processes and have been shown to contribute to
increased cancer rates and affect pregnant women.

566,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2011 05:36AM ET</span>",RPT-RPT-SPECIAL REPORT - China tries to give old king coal a merrier soul,"
already been shut down and the standards are likely to get
tougher in the coming years. As Beijing introduces new
environmental taxes that will push up the price of coal even
further, big consumers will have another incentive to cut back.	
 Paul Manley, Wood Mackenzie's coal analyst in China, said
the country's coal production could soon return to normal
growth levels once Beijing's consolidation drive comes to an
end and is forecasting annual output to increase another 1.9
billion tonnes by 2020 to more than 5 billion tonnes a year.	
 China has spent heavily on new mines -- 320.7 billion yuan
($50 billion) in fixed asset investment in the first 11 months
of the year, up 22.7 percent compared to the same period of
2011, according to industry figures.
    Extensive geological surveys in Inner Mongolia -- an
autonomous region of 1.2 million square km accounting for 12
percent of China's total area -- may lead to more coalfield
discoveries.
    Massive investments in wind power will reduce the
country's dependence on coal, while some believe China's
rapidly developing solar power technology may well hold the
key to long-term energy security in a country that has some of
the world's biggest deserts.	
 Although solar power generation costs are now about 2-3
times higher than for coal in China, solar power could become
as cheap as coal-fired power by around the middle of this
decade, thanks to the sharp fall in the cost of photovoltaic
cells used in solar panels, said Dylen Liu, a researcher at
Pacific Epoch consultancy in Shanghai.	
 When it comes to supply shortfalls in the short term,
however, some traders reckon the only quick fix is abolishing
the 17 percent import tariff on coal.
    ""Clearly, the government should cut the import tariffs and
allow foreign coal to compete on a level playing field. It is
also the most effective way to lower fuel costs for the
state-owned power plants,"" said the head of a European coal
trading firm.	
 
 COAL THEME PARK	
 In Fuxin, the mines may be running dry but coal will
continue to dominate the city's future. Outlying mines produce
around 20 million tonnes of coal a year, and state power giant
Datang Group is building a massive coal gasification plant in
the city. 
 At the bankrupt Haizhou mine, more radical solutions are
necessary. It employed 30,000 miners at its peak, but now only
around 1,000 brave the fires to excavate the last remnants of
coal. Production will cease at the end of 2012.	
 The city has lined up investors from Guangdong and Macau
for a five-star hotel near the site, but plans to construct a
golf course have been put on hold. Local officials remain open
to the possibility of building a ""coal mine disaster theme
park"" in the area, where methane blasts could be simulated by
bombarding guests with black ping-pong balls.	
 Premier Wen Jiabao, who visited the site in 2003,
encouraged the rehabilitation project. Eating dumplings with
miners during Chinese New Year celebrations, he urged the
country to learn from the suffering and sacrifices of coal
workers everywhere.
    Chen Qi, head of the Fuxin tourist bureau, said private
investment in the tourism and park projects was expected to
reach about 4 billion yuan over the coming years, while the
complete rehabilitation of the mine will cost more than 10
billion yuan.	
 The city also aims to become a wind power base,
manufacturing blades and turbines as well as supplying
electricity to the rest of Liaoning, a transformation almost
as startling as turning its colliery into a tourist site. 
""The situation in Fuxin is horrendous -- it is like going on
the moon, and the scale of what needs to be done is
frightening,"" said Sindicatum's Creedy, who visited the site.
    Through the smoke and haze of the Haizhou mine, local
officials in Fuxin look on the bright side.
    ""You're probably surprised by what we have already done,""
said Chen of the Fuxin tourist bureau, waving her hand at the
city's new museum housing the model of the coalmine park near
the entrance to the Haizhou mine. The spotless public square
on which the museum stands displays a monument to the city's
sacrifices, along with three giant pieces of old Soviet-era
machinery dragged from the pit.
    ""We are convinced that all these plans will come to
fruition and in 10 years time this place will be completely
transformed.""

 FUXIN, China, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Near the entrance of what
was once Asia's biggest open-cast coal mine, Fan Chunming
smiles as he points to a scale model of a manicured park with
playgrounds, forests and streams -- an Arcadian vision that
will be built in the depths of the pit.	
 ""Construction will begin at the end of 2012 and that's
what the mine will look like in about 10 years,"" said Fan, an
urbane Chinese opera enthusiast, who is one of the officials
entrusted with transforming the dismal site in Fuxin in
northeastern China's Liaoning province into a national tourist
attraction.	
 Right now, the Haizhou coalmine, a freezing wilderness of
winter mist and smog, couldn't look more different. Trucks
heave in and out of the mine and thick smoke billows from its
depths, coating the area in a sulphurous fug that hugs the
surrounding slopes. The taste in the air is like spent matches. 
 Yet this is a considerable improvement. ""Ten years ago
you'd come here to the side of the mine and you'd be coughing
and spitting, and the spit would instantly be black,"" Fan said.

   Fuxin is a case study of the challenges China faces now and
in the future, with king coal reigning over China's energy
industry.	
""Fuxin is a manifestation of problems that occur all over
the old mining areas in China and are particularly prevalent
in the northeast,"" said David Creedy, a veteran mining
specialist who now works in Beijing with the British carbon
project developers, Sindicatum. ""Fuxin is maybe the worst
example but there are lots of other historic, environmental
problems that need to be handled,"" said Creedy, a former World
Bank consultant.	
 Coal has left many of China's cities sinking and choking,
its water supplies contaminated and a large section of its
workforce suffering from chronic health problems. Fuxin's mine
fires are nothing compared to those a century old that
continue to burn in the northwest, polluting the air. Floods
and explosions also make China's mines the deadliest in the
world.	
 Despite talk of limiting production and tougher
environmental standards, coal output is surging and China is
spending heavily on new exploration projects. While investment
in renewable energy is set to hit record levels, coal will
fuel most of the country's economy for the foreseeable future
and policymakers are figuring out how to make better use of it.	
 Coal has supplied more than 70 percent of China's energy
for the past 50 years and consumption has increased around 10
percent a year since 2000. Routine disruptions in supplies
regularly wreak havoc on the country's economy - power cuts
hit large parts of China last month after freezing weather
slowed coal deliveries, and worse is expected in January if
temperatures plunge.	
 The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicted China
will need to add 736 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity by 2035
to meet the requirements of economic growth and replace
retired plants.
    With each gigawatt of coal-fired generation requiring some
2.9 million tonnes of coal per year, those forecasts mean
China would not only require massive investment in new plants
but also an additional 2.13 billion tonnes a year of coal -
total output last year was an estimated 3.2 billion. That
would be a 60 percent jump in coal usage, ruining Beijing's
plans to reduce coal's share of total generation to 70 percent
by 2020 from 80 percent now.
    ""We don't have a lot of gas. Nor we do have a lot of oil.
The only resource that is cheap and we have in abundance is
coal, so our economy will have to rely on coal for a long time
to come,"" said Ren Guangxi, President of Hangzhou Haoyang
Energy Co Ltd.
    SINKING CITY
    The Haizhou open-cast coalmine began operations in 1953
and supplied half of Fuxin's coal requirements in the decades
that followed, feeding a huge Soviet-built power plant that
dominates the city's low-lying, ramshackle skyline. With
miners digging ever deeper for dwindling supplies, the mine
was finally declared bankrupt in 2005.
    More than 60 percent of Fuxin's workforce once had jobs in
the coal industry, but as its mines deplete, the city has had
to tackle crippling unemployment, life-threatening pollution
and catastrophic land subsidence.
    Satellite photographs of the Haizhou site show a massive
crater resembling an asteroid hit. Five decades of intensive
excavation left an abyss 4 km wide (2.4 miles) and 300 metres
deep, along with a legacy of pollution and land subsidence the
local government is only beginning to address.
    The foundations of the city were literally undermined.
Around 100 square km of the city, with 27,000 buildings and
around 78,000 residents, was on the verge of caving in at one

Heilongjiang, Shandong and Hubei have faced declining
production despite efforts to dig deeper underground. As a

Jiangsu and Guangdong have shut down their own mines, but
their coal consumption continues to rise. That has shifted the

importers, and growth of coal production is concentrated in
two western provinces: Inner Mongolia and Shanxi,"" said

 FUXIN, China, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Near the entrance of what
was once Asia's biggest open-cast coal mine, Fan Chunming
smiles as he points to a scale model of a manicured park with
playgrounds, forests and streams -- an Arcadian vision that
will be built in the depths of the pit.	
 ""Construction will begin at the end of 2012 and that's
what the mine will look like in about 10 years,"" said Fan, an
urbane Chinese opera enthusiast, who is one of the officials
entrusted with transforming the dismal site in Fuxin in
northeastern China's Liaoning province into a national tourist
attraction.	
 Right now, the Haizhou coalmine, a freezing wilderness of
winter mist and smog, couldn't look more different. Trucks
heave in and out of the mine and thick smoke billows from its
depths, coating the area in a sulphurous fug that hugs the
surrounding slopes. The taste in the air is like spent matches. 
 Yet this is a considerable improvement. ""Ten years ago
you'd come here to the side of the mine and you'd be coughing
and spitting, and the spit would instantly be black,"" Fan said.

   Fuxin is a case study of the challenges China faces now and
in the future, with king coal reigning over China's energy
industry.	
""Fuxin is a manifestation of problems that occur all over
the old mining areas in China and are particularly prevalent
in the northeast,"" said David Creedy, a veteran mining
specialist who now works in Beijing with the British carbon
project developers, Sindicatum. ""Fuxin is maybe the worst
example but there are lots of other historic, environmental
problems that need to be handled,"" said Creedy, a former World
Bank consultant.	
 Coal has left many of China's cities sinking and choking,
its water supplies contaminated and a large section of its
workforce suffering from chronic health problems. Fuxin's mine
fires are nothing compared to those a century old that
continue to burn in the northwest, polluting the air. Floods
and explosions also make China's mines the deadliest in the
world.	
 Despite talk of limiting production and tougher
environmental standards, coal output is surging and China is
spending heavily on new exploration projects. While investment
in renewable energy is set to hit record levels, coal will
fuel most of the country's economy for the foreseeable future
and policymakers are figuring out how to make better use of it.	
 Coal has supplied more than 70 percent of China's energy
for the past 50 years and consumption has increased around 10
percent a year since 2000. Routine disruptions in supplies
regularly wreak havoc on the country's economy - power cuts
hit large parts of China last month after freezing weather
slowed coal deliveries, and worse is expected in January if
temperatures plunge.	
 The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicted China
will need to add 736 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity by 2035
to meet the requirements of economic growth and replace
retired plants.
    With each gigawatt of coal-fired generation requiring some
2.9 million tonnes of coal per year, those forecasts mean
China would not only require massive investment in new plants
but also an additional 2.13 billion tonnes a year of coal -
total output last year was an estimated 3.2 billion. That
would be a 60 percent jump in coal usage, ruining Beijing's
plans to reduce coal's share of total generation to 70 percent
by 2020 from 80 percent now.
    ""We don't have a lot of gas. Nor we do have a lot of oil.
The only resource that is cheap and we have in abundance is
coal, so our economy will have to rely on coal for a long time
to come,"" said Ren Guangxi, President of Hangzhou Haoyang
Energy Co Ltd.
    SINKING CITY
    The Haizhou open-cast coalmine began operations in 1953
and supplied half of Fuxin's coal requirements in the decades
that followed, feeding a huge Soviet-built power plant that
dominates the city's low-lying, ramshackle skyline. With
miners digging ever deeper for dwindling supplies, the mine
was finally declared bankrupt in 2005.
    More than 60 percent of Fuxin's workforce once had jobs in
the coal industry, but as its mines deplete, the city has had
to tackle crippling unemployment, life-threatening pollution
and catastrophic land subsidence.
    Satellite photographs of the Haizhou site show a massive
crater resembling an asteroid hit. Five decades of intensive
excavation left an abyss 4 km wide (2.4 miles) and 300 metres
deep, along with a legacy of pollution and land subsidence the
local government is only beginning to address.
    The foundations of the city were literally undermined.
Around 100 square km of the city, with 27,000 buildings and
around 78,000 residents, was on the verge of caving in at one
point, earning Fuxin the title of ""sinking city"". While a
catastrophic landslide has been averted, much work needs to be
done to shore up the mine's embankments, said Li Zhao, an
official with the local land and resources bureau.
    ""We are still trying to solve the problem. We have to sink

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - World stocks firmed on Tuesday on
hopes for a solid earnings season, while the euro steadied above
four-month lows after Japan offered to buy euro zone bonds.
 Japan said it was considering buying about 20 percent of the
bonds to be jointly issued later this month to raise funds to
support Ireland, but investors remained cautious ahead of a
make-or-break debt auction in struggling Portugal on Wednesday.

 Spain will follow suit on Thursday.
 European stocks rose, bouncing back from the previous

aluminium major Alcoa  after the Wall Street closing bell
on Monday, which marked the start of the U.S. earnings season.

 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> gained 1.2 percent. World
stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were up 0.4 percent

 Stock index futures indicated a higher open for Wall Street
 while Japan's Nikkei closed down 0.3 percent.
 Analysts said the prospect of solid corporate earnings was
generally giving stock investors the room to look past euro zone
debt concerns for the time being.
 ""The focus is switching to companies' results this week,
with earnings due from big U.S. names such as JPMorgan ,
but the euro zone debt fears will remain in the backdrop and
could continue to weigh on banking stocks,"" said Geraud
Missonnier, trader at Saxo Banque in Paris.
 Banking stocks were among the top gainers on Tuesday,
reversing recent losses -- the STOXX 600 European banks index
<.SX7P> was trading 1.8 percent higher, helped by upbeat notes
from Citigroup and Societe Generale.
 An upbeat outlook from Siemens , Europe's biggest
engineering conglomerate, also helped European stocks. It said
first-quarter profit and sales were set to surpass year-earlier
figures, thanks to robust factory demand. [ID:nN10295611]
 
 JAPAN RESCUE?
 Japan pledged to buy euro zone bonds this month in a show of
support for Europe's debt struggle, but market players doubted
the gesture would offer the euro much relief.
 The euro steadied above a four-month trough, but the focus
was on this week's heavy schedule of debt issuance by southern
European countries.
 ""The euro remains a sell on rallies,"" said Jeremy Stretch
head of currency strategy at CIBC World Markets.
 The single currency was up a little on the day at $1.2955
.
 Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates attempted to put a
floor under persistent talk that his country will seek an
international bailout, saying there were no such plans and that
the 2010 budget gap was lower than its goal. [ID:nLDE70A0V5]
 But a Portuguese central bank board member, Teodora Cardoso,
was quoted as saying Lisbon would do better to seek
international financing, breaking ranks with political leaders.

 * Medvedev says it should be treated as ""business""

 * Long-stalled deal part of wider U.S.-Russia ""reset""

(Adds Medvedev, Rosatom head quotes)
 By Steve Gutterman
 MOSCOW, Jan 11 (Reuters) - A long-stalled civilian nuclear
cooperation agreement between Russia and the United States
entered into force on Tuesday in a milestone for the ""reset"" in
relations between the former Cold War foes.
 The so-called 123 Agreement took effect with an exchange of
diplomatic notes between Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Sergei
Ryabkov and U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Beyrle in a brief
ceremony in Moscow.
 ""This is really good work. It should not be politicized as
sometimes happened in the history of Russian-American relations,
but treated as business. Then we will achieve good results,""
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said. 
 The agreement, signed in 2008 but shelved by the White House
amid acrimony over Russia's war with U.S. ally Georgia, was
revived by President Barack Obama as part of his campaign to
improve ties and bolster trade and security cooperation.
 It creates a legal framework for closer cooperation between
the United States and Russia on civilian nuclear research,
production and trade, and both sides said it would help fight
nuclear weapons proliferation. 
 Sergei Kiriyenko, head of Russia's nuclear power firm
Rosatom, told Medvedev after the signing that the United States
was ""a key market"" for Rosatom, which supplies over 40 percent
of U.S. nuclear fuel under a programme called 'Megatons to
Megawatts'.
 Kiriyenko said in 2010 Rosatom struck contracts worth close
to $5 billion in excess of what was covered under the
20-year-old programme. Following the acquisition of miner
Uranium One, the Russian firm now controlled 20 percent of U.S.
deposits. 
 
 DEVELOPING REACTORS
 Beyrle said Russia and the United States could cooperate in
developing new reactors, fuels and other technology that would
lessen the risk that dangerous nuclear materials could fall into
the wrong hands. 
 The agreement will also help the nations implement a deal
signed last month calling for conversion of Russian research
reactors to the use of low-enriched uranium fuel instead of
high-enriched fuel that can be used to make weapons.
 It permits the transfer -- subject to U.S. licensing
decisions -- of non-restricted technology, material and
equipment including reactors and components for nuclear research
and power production.
 The deal will also allow nuclear energy joint ventures
between Russian and U.S. companies and could potentially give
Russia the right to reprocess spent nuclear fuel that originated
in the United States.
 It comes into force amid expectations that Russian lawmakers
will soon vote to ratify New START, a strategic nuclear arms
limitation pact that is central to the ""reset"" and won approval
in the U.S. Senate last month.
 The speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament said on
Tuesday that lawmakers were likely to vote their final approval
of the treaty by the end of January.

 By Kim Yeonhee and Lee Shin-kyung
 SEOUL, Jan 11 (Reuters) - South Korea unveiled steps on
Tuesday to combat the threat of rising food prices, joining a
flurry of activity as policymakers grow increasingly worried
that inflation could derail a global recovery.
 Central bankers meeting under the auspices of the Bank for
International Settlements warned on Monday that rising prices in
fast-growing economies were an increasing menace and it was
important to anchor inflation expectations.
 The G20 also weighed in late last week, promising action to
find ways to bring down high food prices, which have already
pushed food inflation in countries such as Brazil, China and
India into double digits and forced farmers in Indonesia to
guard their high-value chilli crops around the clock.
 The United Nations food agency provided an uncomfortable
reminder of the 2008 global food crisis, when riots erupted in
several countries and others banned food exports, by reporting
last week that world food prices had risen above 2008 levels.
 In South Korea, where food makes up about 15 percent of the
consumer price index (CPI), the government said it would
increase the supply of vegetables, meats and fish ahead of Lunar
New Year holidays that start at the end of January.
 The government listed 16 agricultural and fish products for
additional supplies after the country's President Lee Myung-bak
declared a ""war on prices"" in the year's first cabinet meeting
on Jan. 4.
 ""The measure is aimed at keeping prices stable, as demand is
increasing for those products ahead of the New Year holiday, and
is also aimed at taming expectations of price volatility,"" said
Lee Yong-jae, a finance ministry director in charge of the
measures.
 Korea also said it would set up a trading company for the
longer term to import grains directly. The move is part of
anti-inflation measures due to be announced on Thursday after
consumer prices rose in the year through December more than
expected, led by food and fuel prices.
 The grains trading company will be established in Chicago in
the first half of this year to manage global food price
volatility. The country imports 14 million tonnes of grain a
year and the company will buy about 30 percent of the total in
the future.
 French Agriculture Minister Bruno Le Maire called for
stricter regulation to avoid speculation on commodities leading
to market swings. But he said the current situation was not as
worrying as in 2008, thanks to a string of bumper harvests in
Africa. 
 
 TAKING ACTION
 Wheat prices rose 47 percent last year, corn more than 50
percent and U.S. Soybeans by 34 percent. The United Nations'
Food and Agricultural Organization said in its report key grains
prices could rise further.
 Saudi Arabia announced it was boosting wheat reserves to
cover a year instead of six months. The Kingdom suffered like
other Gulf Arab states from the 2008 price spike. It has since
sought to lease and buy farmland in developing nations to
improve the security of its food supplies.
 Reflecting rising concern over food prices, Indonesia said
on Friday it would scrap import duty on wheat, soybeans and
livestock feed. Its president urged Indonesians to plant their
own food to help ease price pressures.
 Algeria's government suspended customs duties and tax on
imports of sugar and cooking oil after riots over food.
Bangladesh has launched a drive to distribute rice and wheat to
the poor and Ethiopia has instigated price caps.
 The 2008 food crisis was initially sparked by fear of wheat
shortages in some countries.
 This led some governments to impose export restrictions on
rice, the key staple substitute, Credit Suisse said in a report
last week that concluded further adverse weather shocks would be
needed to drive food prices much higher this year.
 However, several countries are seeing a sharp rise in food
prices as global demand outstrips production. The concern is
that if food inflation spreads to broader inflation in the
economy, it could undermine the recovery from the global
financial crisis.
 India farm minister, Sharad Pawar, told reporters on Monday
that the government was ""cautious"" about exporting food since
the country's food inflation jumped late in December to more
than 18 percent -- its highest in more than a year.
 In Australia, the worst floods in Queensland in 50 years
could push up vegetable and fruit prices as much as 30 percent,
which could weigh on retail spending.
 ""We are going to see far heavier impacts now in terms of
availability and price rises on a lot of lines,"" said Jim
Cooper, a spokesman for Coles, Australia's second-biggest
supermarket chain owned by Wesfarmers.
 Up to half of the country's wheat crop could be downgraded
to low-grade grain, which will squeeze global supply of higher
quality wheat.
 
 ASIA RICE SUPPLY AMPLE
 Japan's agriculture minister sounded less cautious about the
rising cost of food. A 14 percent rise in the yen last year has
helped the country offset rising commodity prices.
 Michihiko Kano said at a regular briefing on Tuesday that
Japan, the world's biggest net importer of food products, would
monitor developments but no action was planned.
 ""As of now, we are not reviewing our national food
reserves,"" he said.
 Analysts said rice supplies in Asia were ample through the
first quarter, which will keep prices in check. Indeed, Asian
rice prices, based on benchmark Thai prices, fell last year as
other grains shot higher.
 Vietnam, the world's second-biggest exporter after Thailand,
said that it had revised up its estimate of stocks of the grain
by 40 percent. The stockpile will be enough to meet its early
2011 loading commitments.
 Last week, Thailand said it would maintain its rice exports
this year at similar levels to last year and the Philippines,
the world's biggest importer, has said it plans to cut its 2011
purchases by half.
 However, Angelito Banayo, the administrator of the state
grains agency, the National Food Authority, said on Monday the
Philippines wanted to start importing rice in the first quarter
despite ample stock levels.
 ""Realistically, we could wait until probably the second
quarter because of our huge inventory. But there is no certainty
that prices will go down in the second quarter,"" he said.

 * Says China must ensure safety, return on its investments
 * Yu is confident in euro, bearish on dollar
 By Kevin Yao
 BEIJING, Jan 11 (Reuters) - China has shown support for the
euro by promising to buy bonds from debt-ridden European
countries, but it needs to be wary of investment risks, a former
adviser to the central bank said on Tuesday.
 It will be safer for China to buy bonds issued by the
European Financial Stability Facility rather than from individual
countries, Yu Yongding, an influential economist in the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, a government think tank, told
Reuters.
 ""On the one hand, we want to provide support. On the other
hand, we need to consider the safety of our assets,"" said Yu, a
member of the central bank's monetary policy committee until
2006.
 ""In principle, we support the euro, but we also need to
ensure that our investment is safe and generates returns,"" he
said.
 ""Whether we should buy the European stability fund or
national debt is different. I think it's much safer if we buy the
fund as it has a triple-A rating,"" he added.
 The European Financial Stability Facility is a 440 billion
euro ($570 billion) fund that helps heavily indebted euro zone
nations. It can raise funds on international markets at
competitive rates because it enjoys a top credit rating. There
are strict conditions for countries receiving aid from it.
 So far, China has publicly promised to buy government debt
from Greece and Spain, but has abstained from giving details
about the size of its investment commitments.
 Spanish daily El Pais said on Thursday that China was ready
to buy about 6 billion euros of Spanish debt, citing government
sources. Neither the Chinese nor Spanish governments have
confirmed the report. [ID:nLDE7050FZ]
 DOLLAR BEAR
 Yu, who has long seen the euro as an attractive alternative
to the dollar for its foreign reserves, again voiced his optimism
about the troubled single currency and reiterated his bearish
view of the dollar.
 ""I have confidence in the euro. Europe's economy is not that
bad. German's economy is in very good shape and France's economy
is doing okay,"" Yu said.
 ""The dollar will definitely weaken over the long term. There
shouldn't be any doubt about that,"" he added, noting that the
dollar had fallen more than 90 percent in broad-based terms since
the 1920s.
 Loose fiscal and monetary policies adopted to spur the
flagging U.S. economy would undermine the dollar, he said.
 Yu also maintained his view that China needs to further
diversify its huge currency reserves to reduce the dominance of
U.S. Treasuries in its holdings of foreign assets.
 China's foreign exchange reserves, the world's largest, rose
by a record $199 billion in the fourth quarter to $2.847
trillion, the People's Bank of China said on Tuesday.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Jan 11 (Reuters) - The euro on Tuesday hovered above a
four-month trough hit the previous day, after Japan said it may
buy about a fifth of the bonds a European rescue fund plans to
sell later this month to finance its bailout scheme for Ireland.
 But Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda suggested Japan would use
its euro cash holdings to buy the bonds, dampening some of the
initial excitement from traders who had thought the move may
involve fresh buying of the European currency.
 Japan does not disclose the currency breakdown of its $1
trillion reserves but analysts think only a very small portion is
in the euro and the impact of the news may not last long.
 The euro could easily return to its current downtrend given
mounting worries over this week's heavy schedule of debt offers
by southern European countries, market players said.
 ""I don't think these comments change the backdrop for the
euro at all,"" said Todd Elmer, currency strategist for Citi in
Singapore.
 ""Despite the fact that we're seeing this groundswell of
international support, it doesn't really change or address the
underlying problem and that's not going to change until the
European authorities themselves come up with a more comprehensive
solution to mitigate the fallout from the debt crisis.""
 The common currency last traded at $1.2940, down 0.1 percent
from late New York levels, having risen as high as $1.2992
following Noda's comments.
 The euro stayed below its 200-day moving average at $1.3072
and remained within easy reach of Fibonacci support at $1.2794,
the 61.8 percent retracement of a June to November rally.
 The focus this week is on whether Lisbon will be able to
raise funds in the debt market on Wednesday or be forced to turn
to the EU and IMF for financial aid.
 Markets have already pushed the 10-year Portuguese yield to a
punishingly high 7.1 percent, compared with 2.9 percent for
safe-haven Germany.
 Bank of Portugal board member Teodora Cardoso said on Monday
that the country would be able to put its debt crisis behind it
more easily if it received international financing, according to
news agency Lusa.
 In addition to Portugal's debt offer on Wednesday, Italy and
Spain are all due to tap the bond market for funds on Thursday.
 Investors were nervous about whether these highly indebted
countries will be able to raise funds at sustainable levels in
2011.
 Some analysts said the euro could gain once these auctions
were out of way.
 ""Euro zone peripherial bonds tend to be sold on worries
before auctions and bought back after auctions. If this pattern
is repeated, the risk for the euro is on the upside, rather than
downside,"" said Junya Tanase, a currency strategist at J.P.Morgan
Chase Bank.
 The euro climbed on the crosses, rising to 107.50 yen from a
four-month low of 106.83 yen set on Monday.
 It was steady against the Swiss franc at 1.2530 francs from
Monday's low of 1.2432.
 The Swiss franc was restrained in part by talk the
authorities could again try to curb the currency's strength. The
Swiss economy ministry has called business leaders for a meeting
this Friday to discuss possible remedies
 The pause in the euro's decline saw the dollar index retreat
from a six-week peak around 81.313 set overnight. The index,
which tracks the greenback's performance against a basket of
major currencies, was last at 80.97.
 The dollar bought 83.00 yen, a gain of 0.4 percent on the day
following Japanese importers bids, though it is still down from a
recent high of 83.70 yen.
 As the dollar's broad recovery continues, the Australian
dollar tanked, with the news of more floods in the country's
northeast prompting speculators to take profits on the Aussie's
rally to a 28-year high near $1.0260 set on Dec. 31.
 The Aussie fell more than one percent on the day to hit a
one-month low of $0.9820, slipping below trendline support around
$0.9856 as the massive floods, which have already disrupted coal
mining, the country's major export, raced towards Brisbane, the
country's third most populous city.
 The Aussie held just above its 90-day moving average of
$0.9814 and key support at around $0.9810 from a 61.8 percent
retracement of its rally last month.
 The Aussie declined sharply against the euro, which rose 1.3
percent to A$1.3158 after the European currency fell to an
all-time low of A$1.2910 in late December.

 * Japan's Nikkei stock index slips 0.2 percent
 * All eyes on Portuguese debt auction on Wednesday

 By Nick Macfie	
 SINGAPORE, Jan 11 (Reuters) - The euro languished near a
four-month low on Tuesday after a brief rally triggered by a
Japanese plan to buy euro bonds, while Asian stocks drifted,
fearful of Portugal becoming the next casualty of the euro
zone's debt crisis.	
 All eyes were on whether Lisbon would be able to raise
funds in the debt market on Wednesday, its first bond auction
of the year, or if soaring borrowing costs will force it to
turn to the IMF and European Union for help.	
 Japan offered a show of support for Europe's struggle with
debt, saying it would tap its euro reserves to buy bonds this
month for an Irish rescue plan, but the market doubted it
would provide much relief. [ID:nL3E7CB076]	
 ""I don't think these comments (by Japanese Finance
Minister Yoshihiko Noda) change the backdrop for the euro at
all,"" said Todd Elmer, currency strategist for Citi in
Singapore. 
""Despite the fact that we're seeing this groundswell of
international support, it doesn't really change or address the
underlying problem and that's not going to change until the
European authorities themselves come up with a more
comprehensive solution to mitigate the fallout from the debt
crisis.""	
 Japan does not disclose the currency breakdown of its $1
trillion reserves and analysts think only a very small portion
is in euro.	
 The euro rose as high as $1.2992 on trading
platform EBS from around $1.2925 in early Asian trade, but
quickly pared its gains to stand little changed on the day. At
0551 GMT, it was below its 200-day moving average at $1.2940,
just above a four-month trough hit on Monday.	
 Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei index slid 0.3 percent on
worries about the euro zone and overnight weakness on Wall
Street, after hitting an eight-month closing high on Friday.
Tokyo markets were closed on Monday for a public holiday. The
broader Topix index was slightly higher.	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks ex-Japan
inched up 0.2 percent, with Hong Kong's Hang
Seng Index up almost 1 percent.	
 Gold rose on worries about Portugal's debt, maintaining
bullion's appeal as a safety net. A softer dollar typically
helps gold because it makes the metal more affordable for
holders of the euro and other currencies.	
 Spot gold was up $1.35 at $1,375.80 an ounce at
0549 GMT. The focus for the metal was Portugal's Wednesday
bond aution.	
 Portugal is widely seen by investors as next in line in
the euro zone to need a bailout after Greece and Ireland, but
the government has repeatedly denied that it will seek foreign
financing.	
 The European Central Bank threw Lisbon a temporary
lifeline on Monday by buying some of its bonds, traders said.
[ID:nLDE7090U2]	
 The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.3 percent
on Monday, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index edged
down 0.1 percent. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained
0.2 percent. 
 U.S. crude prices were steady above $89 on Tuesday as a
key Alaskan oil pipeline remained shut, cutting total crude
output by nearly 12 percent in the world's largest oil user.

 * Kenya plans oil pipeline link with south Sudan
 * Renewed conflict would saddle neighbours with refugees
 
 By Helen Nyambura-Mwaura and Elias Biryabarema
 NAIROBI/KAMPALA, Jan 7 (Reuters) - East African nations
could reap trade and investment opportunities worth billions of
dollars to help develop south Sudan if it splits from the north,
but they will have to compete with bigger rivals like China to
do so.
 Southerners are expected to vote overwhelmingly in favour of
separation in a referendum next week, a vote that follows
decades of civil war with the north and, the south says,
economic and political marginalisation.
 While companies in neighbouring Kenya and Uganda, from taxi
firms to Kenya's largest lender by assets, Kenya Commercial Bank
(KCB), are already tapping the boundless opportunities in Juba,
the south's capital, others are primed to join in.
 ""We have an advantage but that does not mean we cannot be
outcompeted,"" said James Shikwati, executive director of the
Inter Region Economic Network think-tank.
 ""Powers such as China, Japan, India are also ready. Whatever
we manufacture, they can land here at almost zero cost.""
 Kenya's exports to south Sudan almost doubled between 2005
and 2009, rising to 12.8 billion shillings ($157.7 million) from
6.8 billion after south Sudan rebels signed a peace agreement
with Khartoum's administration that paved the way for Sunday's
vote.
 South Sudan is neighbouring Uganda's main export market,
importing goods worth $184.6 million from east Africa's second
largest economy in 2009, according to the Uganda Exports
Promotions Board.
 ""For the last couple of years south Sudan has been the
largest driving force for our manufacturing sector because its
demand for our products has been remarkable,"" said Maggie
Kigozi, executive director of the Uganda Investment Authority.
 Uganda is establishing a 3.0 billion shillings ($1.29
million) industrial park in Gulu for manufacturers targetting
the south Sudan market, she said. Once a marginalised town at
the heart of northern Uganda's own civil war, Gulu has boomed as
a trading post linking Kampala and Juba.
 Toyota Uganda plans an engineering and repair workshop in
Gulu to tap the neighbouring market, where Toyota's 4x4
Landcruiser rules the dirt tracks.
 
 RISK OF RENEWED CONFLICT
 The risk for East African nations is what happens if the
vote ignites a new conflict that might draw in regional
economies, in which case neighbours could expect a sharp
downturn in demand for their products as well as a torrent of
refugees.
 A return to war might cost neighbouring countries 34 percent
of their total annual GDP over a 10-year period and set back
Kenya and Ethiopia $1 billion annually, according to a report by
Frontier Economics.
 ""If the referendum is conducted well and Khartoum receives
the outcome peacefully and south Sudan is born as a new state,
we're almost certain our annual exports to this new country will
double, our trade with south Sudan will grow tremendously,"" said
Florence Katta, head of the Uganda Exports Promotion Board.
 ""If the vote favours secession and Khartoum starts a war,
our exports will plummet.""
 Kenya's KCB has plans to double its branches in South Sudan
to 30 by 2015 and stands to lose its investment if war erupts. 
 ""It's virgin territory ... It has got the potential to be
the biggest economy in the region in the next 10-20 years,"" KCB
chief Martin Oduor-Otieno said in a Reuters interview.
 ""Everybody is holding their breath. The last thing anyone
wants is another Somalia flaring in the region. If that happens
it will be extremely difficult to stabilise the south,"" said
James Shikwati. ""It's about regional security and stability.""
 
 LAMU CORRIDOR
 Kenya is positioned to pitch itself as a logistics hub and
transport conduit for an independent but landlocked south Sudan.
 The region is rich in oil, the main bone of contention over
the demarcation of borders, which it pipes north to Port Sudan.
 Analysts believe the new state would seek to export its oil
to the Indian Ocean coast via a yet-to-be-built corridor through
Kenya to sidestep Khartoum. 
 Hungry for the south's resources, countries such as China
and Japan will happily finance such an alternative exit route,
analysts say.
 Kenya is seeking investors to fund its $22 billion share of
a planned corridor connecting Ethiopia and Sudan to the Kenyan
coast with railways, roads, telecommunications cables and a
1,400 km pipeline.
 Toyota Tsusho, the investment wing of the carmaker, is one
of the companies interested in the $1.5 billion pipeline,
according to an International Crisis Group (ICG) report.
 
 SOME RESENTMENT
 There is some resentment towards Kenyan and Ugandan business
players investing in south Sudan, however, with some southerners
perceiving them as hawkish and exploitative.
 They say neighbouring countries benefitted from the aid
funding that flowed through their economies when they sheltered
refugees, and should leave the country to its owners.
 ""They got money from the U.N. and many NGOs. They mistreated
us and followed us home to take away what we are suppose to get.
They just want to gain double,"" read an online comment posted by
Ajejo Kak Kokora.
 ""We must rethink again after January the 9th. Many of us
think liberation is only to be free from North. No, liberation
means free even from our neighbour.""

 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, Jan 7 (Reuters) - The euro struggled to stay
above the key $1.30 level against the dollar on Friday as
investors braced for upcoming bond sales from the more
debt-stricken euro zone countries.
 Meantime, global equities struggled to find direction as a
softer-than-expected U.S. labor market report cooled some of
the economic optimism that has fueled a rally since November.
Copper prices eased on concerns about demand.
 U.S. non-farm payrolls increased by 103,000 in December,
the government said, falling short of a Reuters poll that
forecast 175,000 new jobs last month. For details, see
[ID:nN06134458]
 However, the jobless rate fell to 9.4 percent, its lowest
in more than 1-1/2 years, while payroll numbers in October and
November were revised upward.
 ""You can't ignore the fact that, regardless of a
disappointing payrolls outcome, U.S. growth is still looking
better than Europe, and the euro sovereign stress is still
there,"" said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at
Westpac in New York.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 8.97 points,
or 0.08 percent, at 11,706.28. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> was up 1.27 points, or 0.10 percent, at 1,275.12. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> added 1.60 points, or 0.06
percent, at 2,711.49.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> rose 0.2 percent,
fighting off a short bout of selling after the U.S. data.
 World stocks measured by MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> were little changed. Japan's Nikkei average
<.N225> edged up 0.1 percent to an eight-month high.
 The dollar rose, taking its cue from the revisions in the
U.S. jobs report that seemed to underscore that a broader
economic recovery was intact.
 Earlier, investors sold bonds of the most indebted euro
zone governments before a series of issues next week. An
European Union proposal that could force those who lend to
banks to bear big losses if they fail also helped knock the
single currency lower across the board. [ID:nLDE7051NI]
 Portugal, widely seen as the next euro zone state that
could need a bailout after Greece and Ireland, will lead a
series of debt auctions from European nations next week.
[ID:nLDE7051OH]
 ""Next week's supply in Spain, Portugal and Italy will be a

 ""The rising yields at debt auctions in the euro zone will

 LONDON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Sterling extended gains against
the euro on Friday, helped by fund selling of the single
currency due to a renewed rise in concern over euro zone
sovereign debt risks.
 It also recovered ground against the dollar after U.S.
non-farm payrolls disappointed on bullish market expectations,
but traders said the knee-jerk reaction to the data had not
changed the broader trend. 
 Yield spreads between Portuguese, Spanish and Italian
10-year government bonds and their benchmark German counterparts
widened on Friday as markets looked nervously to next week's
heavy debt supply.
 The euro fell 0.6 percent to 83.54 pence, closing in on a
one-month low around 83.50 pence. Traders said the technical
outlook remained negative after this week's break and close
below the 200-day moving average, seen as resistance at 84.81
pence on Friday.
 ""Sterling continues to have an upper hand against the euro,""
one London-based trader said.
 On the week, the euro was set to fall nearly 2.1 percent
against sterling, its biggest weekly drop since mid-November
2010.
 Order flow data from Thomson Reuters Matching suggested more
downside bias for the pair even after a sharp sell-off over the
last three days which has delivered some of the highest daily
trading activity for months.
 Trade-weighted sterling matched a two-week high of 80.8.
 Nonfarm payrolls increased 103,000, the U.S. Labor
Department said on Friday, below economists' expectations for
175,000 which had been revised higher after a strong U.S.
private sector jobs report on Wednesday. The unemployment rate,
however, fell unexpectedly to 9.4 percent.
 ""Nothing really changed after payrolls,"" said Geoffrey Yu,
currency strategist at UBS in London. ""Even though the
unemployment rate fell, the participation rate is down. The
dollar should remain moderately bid but it depends on what
happens to the euro.""
 Sterling rose 0.4 percent to $1.5535 driven by fund demand.
 Trendline resistance stood at around $1.5660, said CMC
Markets analyst Michael Hewson. On the downside, a sustained
move below $1.5400 should open up the $1.5265 area, which
remained the key longer-term target as this level was the 50
percent retracement of the pound's rebound from its low in May
2010 to highs in November, he said.
 Sterling was hit this week as weaker-than-expected services
sector and construction PMIs clouded the UK economic outlook,
although some said the figures were not that surprising given
adverse weather last month. Robust U.S. data also prompted a 1
percent fall in the sterling/dollar pair on Wednesday.

668,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2011 10:16AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Properly positioned for growth?," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Investors have entered 2011 eager
to embrace riskier, higher-yielding assets, but happy to dump
them at the first whiff of anything negative.
 It portends rocky but potentially bullish market sentiment
in the coming week with a new U.S. earnings season getting
underway and signs that the world's biggest economy is mending.
 Positive U.S. economic news -- including an improvement in
the labour market, typically seen as lagging other indicators of
growth -- has generally lifted stocks over the past week,
particularly on bourses in developed, trade-oriented economies.
 Japan's Nikkei gained more than three percent in the first
four trading days of the year, for example, compared with an
annual loss of three percent last year.
 Bond yields have also continued to rise, as they did for
much of the fourth quarter, with prices falling as investors
seek better-yielding assets.
""We have entered the year where consensus expectation has
shifted upwards in terms of global growth,"" said Tristan Hanson,
strategy manager at wealth manager Ashburton in Jersey. ""That
has manifested itself in bond yields rising.""
 For investors, the big issue will be whether they are
correctly positioned for what could turn out to be better global
growth than expected.
 Take, for example, the dollar. The U.S. currency has risen
more against a basket of major competitors over the past week
than all but five weeks in the last two years.
 This has come on the back of the better U.S. economic
outlook. But a number of investors, including those in
dollar-based commodities, have got used over the past few years
to a rising dollar being part of the risk-aversion trade.
 The rising dollar has thus been part of the fall in the
Reuters Jefferies CRB index in the past week, although good
economic news should normally lift most commodities.
 A part of the fall may be related to concerns that new U.S.
growth might mitigate the need for the Federal Reserve's
liquidity-producing quantitative easing (QE) programme, a move
that boosted commodities sharply.
 But a growing economy should nonetheless create demand for
commodities.
 ""If you see the oil price coming off a lot based on a dollar
that is rising because of stronger U.S. economic growth, that
would be a buying opportunity,"" Hanson said.
 
 EMERGING PRICES
 Another new factor for investors to consider is the relative
underperformance of emerging markets stocks, the golden assets
of 2009 and 2010.
 These assets tend to outperform developed market stocks when
equities rise and underperform them when they fall. Hence the
MSCI emerging market index gained 74.5 percent in 2009 and 16.4
percent last year versus 26.9 percent and 9.5 percent,
respectively for MSCI's developed market index.
 In recent months, however, the outperformance -- or beta --
of the trade has begin to diminish, partly as a result of the
huge run up in prices on emerging markets.
 The past week has seen developed markets outperform emerging
ones even when the daily trend was for stocks to rise.
 A number of factors lie behind this, not the least being
that some investors consider emerging market equities to be a
crowded trade.
 Some leading investors have begun leaning towards developed
market companies with emerging market exposure rather than
investing directly.
 Emerging market investors were also rattled in the past week
by Brazil introducing a reserve requirement on banks' short
positions in U.S. dollars. It followed Chile's mounting of a $12
billion intervention to rein in its surging currency.
 Investors will be vigilant for more of this.
 Meanwhile, Tim Ash, head of emerging Europe research at RBS,
reckons the cooling off towards emerging markets is related to
the possibility that an improving U.S. economy will mean a
reining-in of QE.
 ""There is recognition that QE has supported risk assets over
the past year, and nervousness that as liquidity is withdrawn
these same assets risk a downward correction,"" he said in a
note.

 EARNINGS AHEAD
 Investors will get a fresh reading on the U.S. economy from
retails sales data on Friday, but those with a more bottom-up
approach will get a direct test in the coming week of how an
improving world economy may be playing into corporate earnings.
 The quarterly results season kicks off in the United States
with Alcoa, Intel and JPMorgan Chase among the first to report.
 JPMorgan's results, which are expected to have improved from
the third quarter as the global economic outlook has brightened,
will give a taste of what may follow from other major U.S. and
European banks.
 Analysts are expecting a 32 percent increase in earnings
growth from the U.S. season, according to Thomson Reuters
Proprietary Research. That is roughly the same as the third
quarter.

 BERLIN, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Rising prices for raw materials
will be the main challenge for German trade in 2011 and will
prompt imports to rise faster than exports, the head of the
country's main trading association (BGA) said on Friday.
 BGA President Anton Boerner said he expected imports to jump
slightly more than 10 percent, while exports would rise at their
long-term average of 7 percent this year.
 ""Imports will rise more than exports because of the rising
prices for raw materials, and I don't see any stop in the rising
prices,"" Boerner told Reuters in an interview.
 ""Politicians worldwide have to tackle this issue as it is
important for the whole world economy, not only for Germany.""
 Germany, China's biggest trading partner in the European
Union, has accused Beijing of curbing supply of raw materials.
Obtaining rare earths from China needed to make high-tech
products is a particular bone of contention in Germany.
 Boerner said it was a mistake to attribute the rise in
imports to stronger private consumption, adding that he did not
expect this to rise significantly in 2011 due to ""a lot of
unresolved news"" such as the euro zone debt crisis.
 Germany's trade surplus narrowed in November as imports
gained more than expected, official data showed earlier on
Friday, although separate numbers on retail sales showed a
surprise dip in the same month. [ID:nLDE70606P]
 Boerner said other risks to German trade would be problems
in the Chinese economy sparked by inflation and the inability of
the United States and EU to manage their debt crises.
 Market pressure was so great that EU leaders would likely
resolve the debt crisis in the middle of the year, he added.
 He said the euro would not collapse and saw it trading at
between $1.20 and $1.40-45 in 2011. He stuck to his forecast
Germany's economy would grow by 1.5 to 1.75 percent this year.
 
 GERMANY IN DEMAND
 Boerner said he expected Germany to have recovered 90
percent of its pre-crisis trade levels by the end of 2010.
 Europe's largest economy is expected to have grown by
between 3 and 4 percent in 2010, emerging quickly from its
deepest post-war recession and leaving behind peers in the euro
zone still in, or on the brink of, recession.
 While German exports to the EU still make up the bulk of
exports, trade with countries outside the bloc is increasing. In
November, more than 40 percent of total exports went to non-EU
countries and about 37 percent of imports came from them.
 ""Germany stands more to benefit from emerging markets
expansion as we are very strong in the sectors demanded by these
countries,"" Boerner said.
 However, he added the EU would remain Germany's main trade
partner for ""many, many years"". Demand from emerging markets was
stimulating German growth, which in turn led to increased demand
for products made elsewhere in Europe, Boerner said.
 A potential brake on growth was a lack of skilled workers,
Boerner said, which was particularly acute in Germany due to its
focus on high-tech sectors and on research and development.
 ""We have to put more emphasis on recruiting and motivating
people from other countries like Canada and Australia, which is
politically not so easy, however, because the average German is
not so keen on opening borders,"" he said.
 The political debate over the lack of skilled workers has
sparked tensions within Chancellor Angela Merkel's centre-right
coalition, with some leaders stridently rejecting any relaxation
of immigration laws.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Jan 7 (Reuters) - The dollar rose to its highest
in nearly four months against the euro on Friday as a drop in
the U.S. unemployment rate helped offset initial disappointment
over the weaker-than-expected December payrolls report.
 Sentiment on the dollar remained positive despite a
smaller-than-forecast number of jobs created, and analysts
expect gains to continue the next few weeks. Overall, the data
reflected a U.S. economy that was still on a stable growth
track.
 The greenback initially gave up gains against the euro
immediately following the jobs data but recovered to post fresh
peaks of nearly four months. Traders said a large order to sell
euros against sterling right after the data pressured the
euro/dollar pair as well.
 Data on Friday showed U.S. non-farm payrolls increased
103,000, below economists' expectations for gains of 175,000
jobs, but unemployment dipped to 9.4 percent, its lowest in
more than 1-1/2 years..
 ""You can't ignore the fact that, regardless of a
disappointing payrolls outcome, U.S. growth is still looking
better than Europe and the euro sovereign stress is still
there,"" said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist,
at Westpac in New York.
 The dollar was little changed against a basket of major
currencies to 80.769, rising as high as 81.087, its strongest
level since early December. The index has gained over 2 percent
this week, benefiting from a slew of upbeat U.S. data including
a report that showed a record number of private sector jobs
were created in December.
 In the run-up to Friday's employment data, some analysts
were expecting job gains as high as 500,000. The actual data,
however, prompted investors to cover their short positions on
the euro that were built in anticipation of a huge jobs
number.
 ""The headline miss is pretty bad, but the drop in the
unemployment rate is the one reason why the dollar has not
collapsed completely,"" said Brian Dolan, chief currency
strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 ""Overall, a very disappointing number that reinforces the
idea that we're in for a long, slow jobless recovery. The
euro's been in $1.30-$1.35 range for a while, and this number
is not enough to break us out of that.""

 * Four euro zone states in top 10
 * Belgium is quarter's worst performer
 
 By Sujata Rao
 LONDON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Greece topped a list of countries
seen as most likely to default on debt, while fellow euro zone
member Spain also joined the ranks of the riskiest sovereign
debtors in the fourth quarter of 2010, CMA Datavision said.
 Two other peripheral euro zone states, Ireland and Portugal,
rose higher within the top 10, while core members of the
16-country bloc were among those who saw the cost of insuring
their debt against default rise most sharply.
 ""The top five worst performers for the quarter are from
Western Europe, confirmation that 2010 was one of the most
difficult years for the region since the introduction of the
euro in 1999,"" the data provider said in a report.
The cost of insuring Spanish debt against default or
restructuring rose by over 50 percent, placing it seventh on the
list of the 10 riskiest sovereigns, CMA said in the report,
which was released late on Thursday.
 The rankings are based on CMA's calculations, which include
the cumulative probability of default. 
 Ireland and Portugal each saw their rankings on the
risk-list rise several notches in the quarter, to third and
fourth place respectively.
 Greece, which received a 110 billion euro European Union-led
bailout last May, pipped Venezuela as the world's riskiest
sovereign. It had been in the list's top 10 throughout 2010.
 Greek five-year credit default swaps were quoted at 1,026.5
basis points at year-end, meaning it cost just over $1 million
to insure exposure to $10 million of Greek debt over a five-year
period. The CDS rose 32 percent in the fourth quarter, CMA said.
 
 WESTERN EUROPEAN RISK UP
 The final quarter's worst performer was Belgium, whose CDS
widened to 219 bps -- a rise of 70.4 percent -- due to its high
debt and paralysed government. It was followed by Spain and
Germany, both of which saw CDS rise over 50 percent, while Dutch
and French debt insurance costs jumped by over 35 percent.
 Debt insurance costs for Western European sovereigns as
measured by the benchmark Markit iTraxx CDS index have risen
above those of emerging Europe for the first time, after the
euro debt crisis fuelled a rise of almost 140 bps last year.
 Emerging markets performed better, with Ukraine's debt
insurance costs falling the most over 2010 -- by 59 percent, CMA
said. It ended the year as the sixth riskiest sovereign.
Argentine CDS eased nearly 20 percent over the quarter as the
country started moves to restructure defaulted debt, while
Romanian debt insurance costs fell by 17 percent in the last
three months of 2010, allowing it to leave the top 10 list.
 But European Union member Hungary, with its high public
debt-GDP ratios and controversial policies, entered the ranks of
the riskiest sovereign debtors at ninth place, its debt
insurance costs up 18 percent over the quarter.
 Among the least risky sovereigns, Norway, Finland and Sweden
topped the ranks again but the Netherlands fell out of the top
10 as its debt insurance costs rose. Saudi Arabia was the new
entrant to the group, coming in at 10th place.
 The debt risk profile of Germany worsened, coming in at
ninth place on the least risky list -- down four notches. The
United States, however, improved its position, jumping from
ninth to fifth place, benefiting from the Federal Reserve's plan
to pump $600 billion to kickstart the economy.

 * Pakistan imports could ease price pressures	
 * Indian food inflation at year high	

(Adds policy adviser, Foreign Ministry comment)	
 By C.J. Kuncheria and Vipul Tripathi	
 NEW DELHI, Jan 7 (Reuters) - India is trying to persuade
Pakistan to resume full exports of onions, the foreign
minister said on Friday, as food inflation weighs on Asia's
third-largest economy and fuels anger against the ruling
coalition.	
 Discontent over food inflation has been a major headache
for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who is struggling with a
slew of corruption charges against his government, eroding its
political capital from an impressive election victory in 2009.	
 Pakistan banned overland exports of onions to India on
Jan. 4 with traders saying they feared shortages in Pakistan.
Exports by sea are allowed, but much of the trade used to be
by cheaper and quicker road and rail.	
 ""We have initiated talks and before not too long we are
hopeful we will find a solution to this, easing pressure
within our country for onions."" Indian Foreign Minister S. M.
Krishna said in New Delhi.	
 His ministry later said the matter had been taken up with
Pakistan. ""We hope that it can be resolved,"" it said.	
 The price of onions, a staple for Indian families who use
them in almost all dishes, rose more than 23 percent over the
week to Dec. 25.	
 Soaring onion prices have helped dislodge state
governments in the past and rising food costs often spark
street protests.	
 India's food inflation rose for the fifth straight week to
the highest in more than a year this week, reinforcing fears
it has spilt over to broader prices and cementing expectations
of a January interest rate rise.	
 Unseasonal rains have been blamed for pushing up prices of
vegetables such as onions and tomatoes, but some commentators
point to poor agricultural productivity and transport after
years of minimal reform and scant government investment.	
 The deputy chairman of India's Planning Commission, Montek
Singh Ahluwalia, told Reuters in an interview the recent spurt
in food inflation was because of supply constraints but prices
should cool by February. [ID:SGE70608A]	
 The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation said on
Wednesday global food prices hit a record high last month,
above 2008 levels when riots broke out in countries as far
afield as Egypt, Cameroon and Haiti.	
 In a sign of possible voter anger over high prices and
corruption, a poll published on Friday showed India's ruling
Congress party would lose its majority if an election was held
now.	
 Congress would lose about 40 of its 206 seats in the
545-seat lower house of parliament, the AC Neilsen poll
showed, as 44 percent of respondents said Singh's previously
unimpeachable image had been affected by the scandals.	
 The Mood of the Nation poll, conducted by AC Neilsen and
India Today magazine, surveyed 12,349 voters across 19 states
in face-to-face interviews between Dec. 4-19.	
 The government has ordered raids on onion traders to stop
hoarding.

 WASHINGTON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama's
appointment of Treasury aide Gene Sperling as his new top
economic adviser is the latest in a flurry of changes marking
his biggest staff shake-up since taking office two years ago.
 The mid-term realignment could give Obama fresh thinking
from his inner circle as he grapples with newly emboldened
Republicans in Congress while pushing a jobs and recovery
agenda seen as vital to his 2012 re-election chances.
 Sperling's selection -- together with the naming of
JPMorgan Chase executive William Daley, a former commerce
secretary, as White House chief of staff on Thursday -- will
mean a bigger role for veterans of the Clinton administration,
which presided over a growing economy.
 Their Wall Street connections could also help repair
Obama's frayed relations with the business world.
 Here is a rundown of the staffing moves under way:
 TOP WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISER
 Sperling's appointment, which a White House official said
Obama would announce later on Friday, gives the president a new
director of the National Economic Council, the coordinator of
economic policy across the administration. He replaces Larry
Summers, who returned to teaching at Harvard University.
 Sperling led the council under President Bill Clinton from
1997 to 2000, when he navigated battles with opposition
Republicans during a time of balanced budgets. He is also a
former corporate consultant.
 A trusted Obama aide, he will now face the challenge of
helping reinvigorate an anemic economy and reduce nearly 10
percent unemployment.
 Obama will also announce the promotion of Jason Furman, who
served as a White House staff economist under Clinton, to the
number two slot at the council. He will nominate Katharine
Abraham, a University of Maryland professor who served in
Clinton's Labor Department, to the White House Council of
Economic Advisers.
 WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF
 Obama tapped Daley, 62, as his chief of staff, bringing a
politically seasoned manager with Wall Street credentials into
the most powerful non-elected job at the White House.
 Daley, whose appointment was welcomed by the U.S. business
community, was Clinton's commerce secretary and campaign
manager for then-Vice President Al Gore in his 2000
presidential campaign.
 By picking Daley, Obama is reaching outside his original
inner circle. Some supporters had urged the president to bring
in people with new ideas in response to the Republican rout of
his Democrats in the November congressional elections.
 Daley is the brother of Richard Daley, outgoing mayor of
Obama's adoptive hometown of Chicago, and the permanent
replacement for Rahm Emanuel, the hard-charging former chief of
staff. Emanuel left to run for the Chicago mayor. Interim chief
of staff Pete Rouse was named counselor to the president.
 VOLCKER TO STEP DOWN
 Still to come: the resignation of former Federal Reserve
Chairman Paul Volcker as head of a panel advising the president
on economic recovery, sources close to the decision have said.
 Volcker, 83, will leave the President's Economic Recovery
Advisory Board, but is ready to advise Obama on an informal
basis, one source said. The decision was Volcker's, and an
announcement could come as early as Friday.
 Volcker became a legend on Wall Street when as Fed chief he
broke the back of double-digit inflation in the early 1980s. He
was also the driving force behind the ""Volcker Rule,"" a
provision in last year's financial reform law that limited big
banks' proprietary trading, despite Wall Street objections.
 DEFENSE SECRETARY
 Robert Gates has signaled his intention to resign as
defense secretary sometime in 2011. Analysts said he probably
will not leave until late spring or even the middle of the
year. Top contenders include Democratic Senator Jack Reed, an
Army veteran whose counsel Obama has sought out on issues like
Afghanistan, and Chuck Hagel, a former Republican senator.
 WHITE HOUSE POLITICAL AND COMMUNICATIONS TEAM
 Senior adviser David Axelrod, Obama's main message man, is
leaving within the next several weeks and will begin working on
the president's re-election campaign in a few months. David
Plouffe, Obama's 2008 campaign manager, will take up a new
advisory role at the White House next week.
 Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, one of the administration's
highest-profile faces, said he would leave in early February
but made clear he would continue appearing on Obama's behalf to
make the argument against his 2012 Republican challengers.
 A successor is expected to be named in a couple of weeks.
The short list: Vice President Joe Biden's spokesman, Jay
Carney, and two Gibbs deputies, Bill Burton and Josh Earnest.
 TURNOVER AMONG OTHER SENIOR AIDES
 Summers was the latest departure from an economic team that
has seen wholesale turnover. Austan Goolsbee, longtime adviser
to Obama, replaced Christina Romer as head of the Council of
Economic Advisers in September. Jack Lew was confirmed as
budget director, replacing Peter Orszag, who left in July.

(Recasts lead, updates with jobless data)
 By Alister Bull
 WASHINGTON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will
name another veteran of the Clinton administration to be his
new economic adviser on Friday as part of a staff shake-up aimed at driving the U.S. recovery and winning re-election in
2012.
 A White House official said Obama will announce the
appointment of Gene Sperling as the new head of his National
Economic Council in remarks at a window factory in which he
also will discuss the economy and December's job report.
 U.S. unemployment dipped to 9.4 percent last month from 9.8
percent in November, the Labor Department reported on Friday
while the economy created 103,000 new jobs, which was fewer
than analysts had expected.
 Sperling's pick to replace Larry Summers at the economic
council follows Obama's naming of a new chief of staff and the
departure of his press secretary, as the president shakes up
his team after Republicans took control of the House of
Representatives this week.
 The NEC coordinates economic policy across the
administration and its head wields great influence within the
White House. Summers who also served President Bill Clinton as
Treasury Secretary, was seen as providing key advice to Obama
during the depths of the 2008-2009 financial crisis.
 Obama will speak at the Thompson Creek Window Co. in
Landover, Maryland, at around 11:35 a.m. EST (1635 GMT).
 Sperling, a counselor to Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner, served as head of the NEC for Clinton between 1997
and 2000, and helped Clinton battle the Republicans and,
eventually, balance the budget.
 Obama, who must boost growth to ease U.S. unemployment or
be punished in 2012 presidential election, on Thursday tapped
another former Clinton aide, William Daley, an executive at
J.P. Morgan Chase, as his chief of staff.
 MID-TERM SHAKE-UP
 Press Secretary Robert Gibbs also plans to step down early
next month to become an outside adviser to Obama's re-election
campaign.
 The changes, as Obama enters the second two years of his
term, reflect the White House's need to adapt to the new
balance of power in Washington after Republicans won big
against Obama's Democrats in November elections.
 Republicans tapped into public fury over government
spending and a $1.3 trillion budget deficit, and vow to use
their increased congressional muscle to undo Obama's healthcare
reform program and curb federal borrowing.
 Obama, who says he expects a tough debate over spending and
taxes, late last year enlisted another old Clinton hand when he
picked Jack Lew to lead the Office of Management and Budget.
 In addition to Sperling, Obama will announce the promotion
of Jason Furman to the number two slot at the NEC, the official
said. Obama will also announce his plan to nominate Katharine
Abraham to the White House Council of Economic Advisers and
Heather Higginbottom as deputy director of OMB. Both
nominations require confirmation by the U.S. Senate.

 * Thailand vows to maintain rice exports at 2010 level
 * WFP says sugar and cooking oil boosting overall prices

(Adds WFP and venture capital comments)
 By Kim Yeonhee
 SEOUL, Jan 7 (Reuters) - The Group of 20 leading economies
have started working-level talks on the soaring food prices that
are stoking fears of a repeat of the 2008 food crisis.
 Global food prices hit a record high last month,
outstripping the levels that sparked riots in several countries
in 2008, and key grains could rise further, the United Nations'
food agency said this week.
 Policymakers' major concern is that, if unchecked, rising
food prices could stoke inflation, protectionism and unrest.
 Hundreds of youths clashed with police in several Algerian
cities including the capital on Thursday over food prices and
unemployment, residents said.
 Rising food prices could also set back the recovery from the
financial crisis by eroding consumers' disposable budgets in the
fast-growing emerging economies that are leading the revival.
 Rhee Chang-yong, who represents South Korea at the G20,
said working group talks were under way in the G20 with the aim
of improving global cooperation to resolve food security
problems ahead of a summit hosted by France.
 ""France is emphasising food security. As a former host
country of G20, we would like to deal with the price volatility
problem thoroughly,"" Rhee said.
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy has asked the World Bank to
conduct urgent research on the impact of food prices, a source
familiar with the matter said.
 
 CEREAL PRICES UP IN 2010
 Last year, wheat futures prices rose 47 percent, buoyed by
bad weather including drought in Russia and its Black Sea
neighbours. U.S. corn rose more than 50 percent and U.S.
soybeans jumped 34 percent.
 The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation said in a report
on Wednesday that sugar and meat prices were at their highest
since its records began in 1990. For wheat, rice, corn and other
cereals, prices were at their highest since the 2008 crisis.
 During that crisis, riots broke out in countries from Egypt
to Haiti. Import prices jumped, forcing many countries' trade
balances into a deep and costly deficit and several governments
in Asia imposed export restrictions on rice.
 The U.N.'s World Food Programme (WFP), which was feeding
some 100 million people last year, noted that cereals including
rice had not hit 2008 price peaks, but that sugar and cooking
oil were pushing up the food index.
 ""We're ready to step up assistance specifically to countries
that are vulnerable to these high prices, especially focusing
also on risks to children,"" WFP spokeswoman Emilia Casella told
a news briefing in Geneva.
 She said a fairly good harvest in a number of African
countries in the past year had helped, and that reserves were
higher than in the 2008 crisis while fuel prices, which affect
fertiliser and the transport of food, were lower.
 Robert Prior-Wandesforde, an economist at Credit Suisse in
Singapore, said food commodity prices were unlikely to rise much
further, barring weather catastrophes.
 ""The estimated global and exporting countries' stock-to-use
ratios of both wheat and rice are considerably higher today than
in 2007-08, making shortages and drastic export bans unlikely,""
he said in a report.
 But the London-based venture capital firm Emergent Asset
Management, which holds swathes of land across southern Africa,
still sees much more mileage in food prices.
 ""The world is still in denial about food prices,"" its chief
investment officer, David Murran, told Reuters.
 ""If you look at demographics, if you look at production, if
you look at the impact of climate change, then we are only at
the beginning of this.""
 
 CHILLIS, RICE AND ONIONS
 Many countries in Asia, including India and China, have seen
food inflation jump to double digit levels. China has imposed
price controls to try to ensure stable prices for consumers. On
Friday, Ethiopia announced similar measures.
 Thailand, the world's biggest rice exporter, sought to
reassure the market, with Commerce Minister Porntiva Nakasai
telling reporters it would maintain 2011 exports at 9 to 9.5
million tonnes after shipping 9 million in 2010.
 The Philippines, the world's biggest buyer of rice, said it
would cut its 2011 imports by at least half, compared with
record purchases in 2010, further easing concerns of a tight
rice market this year.
 Still, the head of the National Food Authority, which
overseas rice imports, said it might increase its buffer stock
to cover a minimum 40 days of demand, from 30 now.
 A senior food official in Bangladesh said it was worried
about food security and had imported 250,000 tonnes of rice from
Vietnam.
 In Indonesia, which has the world's fourth-largest
population, a fivefold rise in the price of chillies in the past
year has helped drive overall inflation to near 7 percent.
 Farmers are operating around-the-clock patrols to protect
their chilli plants and President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has
urged households to plant chillies in their gardens.
 In India, where onion prices have triggered protests in the
past, prices have jumped after weather damaged the crop and
officials have opened talks with Pakistan about resuming
imports.

 BEIJING, Jan 7 (Reuters) - China will step up its controls
over the mining of rare earths and release new industry
standards to cut pollution, a minister and media said on
Friday, after the world's biggest supplier cut export quotas
for the minerals.	
 China, which produces about 97 percent of the global
supply of the vital metals, slashed its export quota by 35
percent for the first half of 2011 compared with a year
earlier, saying it wanted to conserve reserves and protect the
environment. [ID:nTOE6BT00S]	
 China will ""strengthen the supervision and management of
mineral resources mining ... and deepen control over rare
earth mining capacity and extraction"", Minister of Land and
Resources Xu Shaoshi said on a webcast on the ministry's
website (www.mlr.gov.cn). He did not elaborate.	
 Xu added that China's campaign against illegal rare earths
mining and effort to better manage the industry had achieved
""notable results"".	
 Meanwhile, new environmental standards, described as
""stringent"" by an expert who helped draft the rules, would
limit the amount of permissible pollutants in each litre of
waste water, the official China Daily said.	
 Under the rules, expected to pinch rare earths miners with
raised environmental protection costs, levels of ammonia
nitrogen would be cut from 25 milligrams to 15 milligrams per
litre, and radioactive elements and phosphorus emissions would
be reduced.	
 The new regulations could be formally unveiled as soon as
February after being approved by China's Ministry of
Environmental Protection in December, the China Daily said.	
 It added that China was considering the creation of a rare
earth industry association and a governmental unit to prevent
more mining abuses.	
 China has said other countries should share the burden of
mining the metals. Illegal mining practices and over-exporting
rare earths have hurt China's environment and depleted its
resources, it says.	
 But China's quotas have sparked tension with global
importers of the metals, and the United States has threatened
to take a complaint to the World Trade Organization, which
judges international trade disputes.	
 Japan's trade minister said this week he wanted to visit
China this month to talk to officials there to secure enough
rare earths, which are vital to make electronics and clean
energy technology including computers, wind turbines and
electric cars. [ID:nTOE70402F]

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a four-month
high versus the euro and a one-month high against a basket of
currencies on Friday ahead of U.S. jobs data, although dollar
bulls risked disappointment if it fell short of expectations.
 A sell-off in peripheral euro zone government bonds before a
flurry of supply next week, an EU proposal that could force
those who lend to banks to bear big losses should they fail and
weaker-than-expected German retail sales numbers knocked the
single currency lower.
 The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies to
81.076, its highest since early December. The index has gained
over 2 percent this week, benefiting from a slew of upbeat U.S.
data including a report that showed a record number of private
sector jobs were created in December.
 This prompted analysts to upgrade their forecasts for
non-farm payrolls to increase 175,000, up from 140,000 in an
earlier Reuters survey. Some in the market are far more
ambitious, looking for an increase of more than 450,000.
 ""There is a lot of weight that is being given to the U.S.
jobs numbers and even if we get a decent number, there is a real
risk that we could see a bounce in the euro/dollar,"" said Neil
Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.
 ""I am still not optimistic about the U.S. economy and
interest rates.""
 Traders will also await Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's
testimony to the Senate. Faced with a newly-empowered Republican
Party that is sceptical of the Fed's latest attempt to stimulate
the U.S. economy, many expect Bernanke to temper some of the
optimism surrounding the recent rebound in economic data.
 
 EURO DEBT PROBLEMS REMAIN
 The euro fell to as low as $1.2960 on trading platform EBS,
after sliding more than 2 percent over the two previous days and
briefly dipped below support in the $1.2970 area -- lows hit in
late November and early December. 
 The $1.2960 level was the lowest since mid-September and not
far from stop-loss offers said to lie below $1.2950.
 While the euro would probably get some respite if the U.S.
jobs data disappoints, any gains could be short-lived, said
Robert Ryan, FX strategist at BNP Paribas in Singapore.
 ""If we don't get a big payrolls number the dollar is going
to get whacked. I mean if it's below 100,000,"" Ryan said. ""That
should see the euro trade up in response, but then we don't see
a sustained gain in the euro,"" Ryan said.
 Traders, however, said there was talk of good bids for the
euro at $1.2920, right near a cluster of intraday highs hit
between mid-August to early September that now act as support.
 With huge bond issuance from euro zone governments lined up
in coming weeks, investors are likely to steer clear of the
single currency if responses to these sales are not encouraging
and borrowing costs keep rising.
 The dollar advanced 0.3 percent to 83.55 yen after rising as
high as 83.57 yen on EBS, its highest in two weeks. This was
partially driven by dollar demand from hedge funds, traders
said.
 Dollar offers from Japanese exporters were said to be
lurking above 84.50 yen, right around the greenback's
mid-December peak of 84.51 yen.

 * Says European sovereign debt provides ""reasonable"" returns

(Adds details, comments)
 BEIJING, Jan 7 (Reuters) - China voiced support for European
government bonds on Friday as crucial investment choices for the
country's massive foreign exchange reserves in the ""past, present
and future"".
 State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) head Yi Gang
also expressed confidence in the struggling euro, saying the
currency played an important role in global markets.
 China invests an undisclosed portion of its record $2.65
trillion in reserves, the world's largest, in the euro. In part
to protect this investment, it has repeatedly expressed faith
that Europe can survive its nagging debt problems.
 ""The euro and European financial markets are important parts
of the global financial system. They are one of the most
important investment territories for China's foreign exchange
reserves in the past, present and future,"" Yi said.
 He said China's European debt purchases provided reasonable
returns and helped stabilise financial markets.
 Yi's comments were published on the central bank's website on
Friday as part of a summary of his remarks in Madrid, which he
visited earlier this week alongside Vice-Premier Li Keqiang.
 Investor concerns that fiscal troubles in peripheral euro
zone nations could spread to bigger countries including Portugal,
Spain and Italy have shaken demand for the euro.
 That, alongside market positioning before U.S. payrolls,
dragged the euro  to a four-month low on the dollar on
Friday. [USD/]
 So far, China has publicly promised to buy government debt
from Greece and Spain, but has abstained from providing specific
values for its investment.
 Spanish daily El Pais said on Thursday that China was ready
to buy about 6 billion euros ($7.79 billion) of Spanish debt,
citing government sources. Beijing and Madrid did not confirm the
report. [ID:nLDE7050FZ]
 Asked about the size and nature of China's European bond
investment on Friday, SAFE -- an arm of the People's Bank of
China that manages China's reserves -- declined to comment.
 Many analysts say China is simply looking after its own
interests by supporting Europe, which also happens to be its
biggest trading partner.
 Jinny Yan, an economist with Standard Chartered in Shanghai,
estimated that China had invested between 26 and 28 percent of
its reserves in the euro.
 Analysts estimate that about two-thirds of China's reserves
are parked in dollar assets, although the currency composition is
a state secret.
 ""As China holds a large amount of euro assets, it wants to
protect the value of those assets,"" she said.
 Chinese officials have for years worried about the country's
vast U.S. Treasury holdings and its attendant dependence on the
dollar. The euro, for now, is seen as the most viable alternative
to the dollar as a reserve currency.
 ""The last thing China wants to see is the collapse of the
euro,"" said Minsheng Securities analyst Zhang Lei in Beijing. ""In
all perspectives, from the diversification of China's foreign
exchange reserves to the needs of geopolitical balance, China
will continue to support the euro by buying euro bonds.""

 By Dominic Lau 
 LONDON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a four-month low
against the dollar on Friday ahead of U.S. jobs data and next
week's bond issues from euro zone peripheral countries, while
world stocks and copper eased.
A surprise sharp increase in U.S. private sector job
creation in December have raised expectations of stronger
non-farm payrolls for the month, with economists now expecting
175,000 jobs were created, up from 140,000 earlier. 
 The broader hopes that has prompted of a more sustained
economic recovery continued to boost the dollar ahead of the
data, due at 1330 GMT.
 Many analysts, however, said markets had become so upbeat on
the payrolls that there was scope for disappointment. Some
pointed to a note of caution from new U.S. claims for jobless
benefits, which rose more than expected last week.
 ""The consensus estimates suggest that U.S. non-farm payroll
figures will show a rise of about 175,000, but the whisper
figure is far higher than that. I think you have some room for
disappointment,"" said Koen De Leus, strategist at KBC Securities
in Brussels. ""If it's a blow-out (high) figure, then the
positive momentum can go on for a while.""
 European shares eased, while U.S. stock index futures were
down about 0.2 percent.
 The dollar gained 0.3 percent against a basket of major
currencies, and 0.2 percent to 83.53 yen.
 The euro dropped 0.2 percent to $1.2975 after trading as low
as $1.2965 on trading platform EBS, its lowest since
mid-September.
 Copper hit two-week low on talk that top consumers China may
be preparing to tighten monetary policy, and gold slipped for
the fifth day in a row.
 
 EURO ZONE PERIPHERALS
 Investors sold bonds of the most indebted euro zone
governments before a series of issues next week. An EU proposal
that could force those who lend to banks to bear big losses
should they fail also helped knock the single currency lower
across the board.
 Portugal, widely seen as the next euro zone state at the
risk of needing a bailout after Greece and Ireland, will lead a
series of debt auctions from European nations next week.
 ""Next week's supply in Spain, Portugal and Italy will be a
good test of investor sentiment,"" said Nick Stamenkovic,
strategist at RIA Capital Markets in Edinburgh.
 Yields on Portugal's 10-year government bonds over benchmark
German Bunds rose 15 basis points to 433 bps, while those on
10-year Spanish bonds over Bunds widened by 6 bps to 264 bps.
The five-year cost of insuring Portugal's debt against default
rose 15 bps to 540 bps.
 Portuguese stocks fell 1.2 percent and Spain's blue chips
dropped 1.5 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300
index shed 0.4 percent.
 ""The rising yields at debt auctions in the euro zone will
continue to spook investors for a while, and it's best to stay
away from peripheral stocks such as Spanish and Portuguese banks
until mid-year when the crisis should ease,"" said Arnaud
Scarpaci, fund manager at Agilis Gestion in Paris.
 World stocks measured by MSCI All-Country World Index

Asia, Japan's Nikkei average edged up 0.1 percent to a fresh
eight-month closing high.
Copper fell for the fourth straight session, down 1.5
percent and was set for a 2.7 percent drop for the week. Gold
eased 1 percent and is down 4.2 percent this week.

 * About 40 percent of harvest expected to be downgraded
 * Shipping berths booked out to end-April

 By Bruce Hextall	
 SYDNEY, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Australia's wheat exports are
likely to dip this year, after heavy rains left up to 40
percent the just-completed crop unfit for millers in
Australia's major, quality-conscious markets, grain traders
and analysts said on Friday.	
 A Reuters poll indicated an average of 14.24 million
tonnes would be exported in the marketing year to Sept. 30,
compared with 14.75 million in 2009/10 estimated by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture in November.	
 The poll indicated a total crop of 23.37 million tonnes,
up from 21.7 million in 2009-10, with estimates ranging from
22 million to 25 million tonnes.	
 But around 9.4 million tonnes of the crop could be
downgraded to less than Australian Standard White (ASW)
milling wheat to poorer-quality general milling wheat or feed
wheat.	
 
 Australia, last year the world's fourth-largest wheat
exporter, could become the third-largest exporter of the grain
this year, displacing Russia which in August banned grain
exports after a severe drought.	
 ""The quantity will be there but not the quality,"" said
Malcolm Bartholomaeus, a respected grain market analyst for
Callum Downs Commodity News.	
 Western Australia, normally the country's top grain
exporting state, saw its crop shrivel after its driest spring
on record. It produced abut 4.4 million tonnes, , helped by
improved grain varieties and some rain in its southern grain
regions.	
 Still, the Western Australia harvest was nearly half the
8.2 million tonnes it reaped in 2009/10.	
Dry weather also lifted protein levels in Western
Australia, making its grain more popular to overseas buyers
who acquire most of the state's wheat crop, said Steve Burt,
head of Pentag Nidera, the Australian arm of privately owned
Dutch firm Nidera.	
Burt said lower-grade wheat would be harder to sell
although a lack of grain out of the Black Sea region had
opened markets and prices were nearly 50 percent higher than a
year ago. 
 ""The world is awash with lower-grade wheat, some of which
will be used for animal feed, while the better grades will be
used for milling even though it doesn't make the ASW standard,
said Burt.	
 Grain shipping berths around the country are fully booked
to end-April by which time about six million tonnes would have
been shipped, he added.	
 Countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam use lower-grade
milling wheat while South Korea is a big buyer of feed wheat
for cattle feedlots.	
 A greater issue is the lack of availability of higher
protein in global markets because of production problems,
including wet harvests in Australia's eastern state of New
South Wales and Queensland, both key producers of high protein
wheat.	
 Normally, around two million tonnes is harvested in these
two states each year but analysts expect well less than one
million tonnes has been reaped this season.	
 ""One of the issues for the market is the lack of hard
wheat as you do not get a lot of hard or higher-protein wheat
come out of South Australia,"" said Paul Deane, an agricultural
economist at ANZ Banking Group.	
 In New South Wales, a record crop of more than 12 million
tonnes had been expected before torrential rains hit the crop
during the harvest, which began late October.	
 But an estimated 2.5 million tonnes has been lost in that
state, leaving about 8.5 million tonnes of ASW wheat and feed
quality wheat.	
 Canada, another leading producer of high-protein wheat,
has also battled wet, cold weather while the U.S. winter wheat
crop faces the threat of frost-kill if a protective snow cover
melts.

 (Adds BGA interview)
 By Annika Breidthardt
 BERLIN, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Germany's trade surplus narrowed
in November as imports gained more than expected, a sign
domestic demand is growing in strength although other data
showed retail sales and industrial output dipped the same month.
 Berlin's struggling euro zone partners are hoping that a
pick up in how much Germans spend will bolster their economies.
Friday's data showed the country's imports rose 4.1 percent,
yielding a trade surplus of 11.8 billion euros.
 Separate preliminary data showed November retail sales and
industrial output fell, but analysts played down those numbers.
 Industry output fell by 0.7 percent on the month in
seasonally adjusted terms, dragged down by manufacturing and
construction, below the median forecast for a 0.2 percent
decrease in a Reuters poll of 17 economists.
 ""It's a little disappointing but we had a strong rise in the
previous month, so the drop is not worrying,"" said Juergen
Michels of Citigroup on the output data. 
 ""The early onset of winter could have played a role here.
The economy is robust and it will stay that way this year too.""
 More forward-looking data on Thursday showed manufacturing
orders grew at their fastest rate in 10 months in November,
thanks to strong demand outside the euro zone.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Exports, the traditional backbone of the German economy,
rose 0.5 percent on the month adjusted for seasonal swings, less
than the 0.8 percent growth forecast in a Reuters poll.
 In unadjusted terms, they totalled 88.0 billion euros in
November, more than in any month since October 2008, adding to
mounting evidence the economy remains in full swing.
 The strong rise in imports marks a sharp turnaround from
Germany's usual reliance on exports and is in line with
expectations that domestic demand is becoming more key.
 The Ifo institute has said that more than three quarters of
Germany's growth would come from the domestic economy in 2011, a
sharp turnaround from its usual reliance on exports. Private
consumption would rise 1.4 percent and investment in machinery
and equipment 8.7 percent, it said.
 But the head of the country's BGA trade association told
Reuters the import jump was not due to stronger private
consumption and that imports would mainly rise due to rising raw
material costs, not consumer spending.
 
 SOLID GROWTH
 Germany's economy is expected to have grown by 3.6 percent
in 2010, according to a Reuters survey of 22 economists,
emerging quickly from its deepest post-war recession the year
before that and leaving behind peers in the euro zone still in,
or on the brink of, recession.
 German 2010 gross domestic product growth data are due on
January 12.
 ""Rising imports are a sign of domestic demand picking up.
That is our contribution to the growth of euro zone countries,
for many of which we are the most important trade partner,"" said
Holger Sandte at West LB.
 ""Exports, too, will go well, even if growth will not be as
strong as in 2010,"" he added.
 German exports to the European Union still make up the bulk
of exports but trade with countries outside the bloc is
increasing. In November, more than 40 percent of total exports
went to countries outside the European Union and about 37
percent of imports came from those countries.
 German carmakers Volkswagen and Daimler will sign deals
totalling $5 billion at a meeting with China's Vice Premier Li
Keqiang on Friday, German government sources told Reuters.
 Volkswagen's premium brand Audi aims to sell 1 million cars
in China over the next three years, it said last month.
 Retail sales fell 2.4 percent on the month when adjusted for
inflation. Over the year, however, growth remained intact and
analysts stressed the numbers are volatile and cover just
three-quarters of retail sales.

 By Farah Master
 HONG KONG, Jan 7 (Reuters) - China's Brightoil Petroleum
(Holdings) Ltd said on Friday that it has signed a $4 billion
strategic cooperation agreement with China Development Bank as
the marine bunker supplier pushes ahead with its rapid expansion
drive.
 Brightoil Petroleum, the top bunker fuel supplier in China's
Pearl River Delta, said the loan would be used to buy tankers, to
expand its petroleum products trading business, and for new
projects and mergers and acquisitions.
 The Hong Kong-listed company has raced ahead with its global
development plans in the past two years, expanding its marine
fuels business in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore and Rotterdam.
 ""We believe we are in a great position to drive the rapid
development of our business, ultimately creating greater returns
for the bank and investors,"" Chairman and CEO Sit Kwong Lam said
in statement.
 In November, Brightoil said it had decided to expand its
business into commodities trading involving non-marine bunker
fuel oil, such as gas oil and crude oil.
 It said it would employ more trading professionals, including
20 former BP Plc employees who joined Shenzhen Brightoil Group, a
private company owned by Sit.
 Brightoil's Hong Kong-listed shares were up 7.3 percent by
the midday trading break on Friday, outperforming the Hang Seng
Index's 0.09 percent gain. Its shares surged about 70 percent in
2010, compared with a 5 percent gain for the HSI.

 By Ian Chua and Masayuki Kitano
 SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, Jan 7 (Reuters) - The euro dropped to a
four-month low versus a broadly firmer dollar on Friday ahead
of U.S. jobs data, which is expected to provide more evidence
of a stronger U.S. economic recovery.
 A sell-off in peripheral euro zone government bonds before
a flurry of supply next week and an EU proposal that could
force those who lend to banks to bear big losses should they
fail helped knock the single currency lower. [ID:nLDE7051NI]
 The euro extended losses after sliding more than 2 percent
over the two previous days and briefly dipped below support at
the $1.2970 area -- lows hit in late November and early
December.
 ""A break below here will open downside potential towards
$1.2590,"" BNP Paribas strategists wrote in a note, referring
to the euro's next significant trough on charts, hit in late
August.
 While the euro would likely get some respite if the U.S.
jobs data disappoints, any gains could turn out to be
short-lived, said Robert Ryan, FX strategist at BNP Paribas in
Singapore.
 ""If we don't get a big payrolls number the dollar is going
to get whacked. I mean if it's below 100,000,"" Ryan said.
 ""That should see the euro trade up in response, but then
we don't see a sustained gain in the euro,"" Ryan said.
 ""If payrolls come in very weak, yes the dollar is in
trouble but the euro zone is just as much in trouble. We still
see it easing,"" Ryan added.
 A surprisingly big increase in U.S. jobs such as 300,000
or more would boost the dollar and could also change the
outlook for the global economy, Ryan said.
 But such a scenario would also be positive for peripheral
euro zone countries and help temper a sell-off in their
government debt, and could eventually limit the euro's
decline, Ryan said.
 The euro dipped as low as $1.2965 on trading platform EBS,
its lowest since mid-September and not far from stop-loss
offers said to lie below $1.2950.
 Traders, however, said there was talk of good bids for the
euro at $1.2920, right near a cluster of intraday highs hit
between mid-August to early September that now act as support.
 The euro later trimmed its losses and stood at $1.3007
, steady from late U.S. trading on Thursday.
 The dollar benefited from weakness in the euro and
remained buoyed by the ADP report, which showed a record
number of private sector jobs were created in December.
 This prompted analysts to upgrade their forecasts for
non-farm payrolls to increase 175,000, up from 140,000 in an
earlier Reuters survey. Some in the market are far more
ambitious, looking for an increase of more than 450,000.

 The dollar edged up 0.1 percent against a basket of major
currencies to 80.839 <.DXY>.
 The dollar held steady against the yen at 83.34 yen
, taking a breather in the wake of its ADP-fuelled rally
earlier in the week.
 Dollar offers from Japanese exporters were said to be
lurking above 84.50 yen, right around the dollar's
mid-December peak of 84.51 yen.
 Macquarie bank analysts said increasing signs that a
strong economic upswing is underway in the United States
should provide support for the greenback over the first half
of 2011.
 ""Beyond this, however, we think the USD could come under
pressure again as the U.S. government's ever-growing budget
deficit comes under increased scrutiny.""

 By Vikram S. Subhedar	
 HONG KONG, Jan 7 (Reuters) - The euro slumped to a
four-month low against the dollar on Friday and looked set for
more weakness if U.S. payrolls data meets recently raised
forecasts, strengthening the case for a sustainable economic
recovery.	
 The greenback remained buoyed by an unexpectedly strong
ADP employment report earlier in the week which showed a
record number of private sector jobs created in December and
prompted economists to raise their forecasts for the payrolls
data.	
 ""The U.S. jobs number is a mega factor going into 2011 for
policymakers as well as markets,"" said Tom Kaan, a director at
Hong Kong-based Louis Capital Markets.	
 ""I'd say the recent dollar strength is more likely due to
profit-taking on short positions because people were so
bearish but if we see U.S. unemployment dip even slightly,
it'll mean that things have actually started getting better,""
said Kaan.	
 Non-farm payrolls probably increased by an estimated
175,000 in December and the jobless rate eased to 9.7 percent
from 9.8 percent, according to a Reuters survey.	
 The U.S. Labor Department will release the closely watched
report at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT)	
 Another key event on Friday is Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke's testimony on the U.S. economic outlook to the
Senate Budget Committee, which investors will scrutinise for
updates on the Fed's plan to continue buying bonds until June.	
 The dollar index , which measures the greenback's
performance against a basket of major currencies, on Friday
hit a high of 80.95, a level last seen in early December.

a series of bond issues next week, and an EU proposal that

board. [ID:nLDE7051NI]	
 Portugal, widely seen as the next euro zone state at the
risk of needing a bailout after Greece and Ireland, will lead
a series of debt auctions from European nations next week.
[ID:nLDE7051OH]	
 
 ASIAN STOCKS EASE, JAPAN OUTPERFORMS	
 Japan's Nikkei , lifted by a strong day on Chinese
bourses, recovered from earlier losses to make a 0.1 percent
gain on the day, taking its weekly rise to 3 percent and
extending its recent outperformance among Asian markets.	
 The MSCI Asia ex-Japan fell 0.5 percent
and was down 0.2 percent in its first week of trading for the
year.	
 Shares in Samsung Electronics , the world's
No.1 memory chip maker, fell 1.3 percent after the company
forecast weaker-than-expected fourth quarter earnings. Most
analysts see this a blip, with demand for many of the
company's businesses, including smartphones, picking up.	
 Samsung shares are up nearly 25 percent over the past
quarter and hovering near record highs. [ID:nTOE70500M]	
 ""I think the fourth-quarter results will mark the bottom.
Although its DRAM chip sector may remain in a slump in the
first quarter, other businesses such as LCD will provide a
boost,"" SK Securities analyst Hwang Yoo-Sik said.	
 Shanghai's key stocks index rose 1.5 percent,
breaking through key chart resistance, driven by shares in
Chinese banks that have lagged global peers. [ID:nTOE70603S]	
 Investors will look ahead to the start of the corporate
earnings season in the U.S. for signs whether an improving
macroeconomic landscape is translating into company profits.	
 Earnings season kicks off next week with aluminum producer
Alcoa , oil major Chevron and technology
bellwether Intel Corp all expected to provide
insights into global growth and demand.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The euro slumped on Thursday to
its lowest level against the U.S. dollar in five weeks and
briefly breached a key support level, but more losses are seen
likely if upcoming key jobs data proves stronger than
expected.
 The euro's losses were magnified by expectations Friday's
U.S. employment report will show a 175,000 gain in non-farm
payrolls for December, according to a Reuters poll. Some in the
market are expecting an increase of as much as 500,000.
 Upbeat data has painted a rosier picture of the U.S.
economic outlook in stark contrast to worries about the euro
zone's sovereign debt crisis.
 The state of the U.S. labor market is key to Federal
Reserve monetary policy and a significant improvement should
set the stage for debate on whether the central bank will
choose to alter the size or scope of its asset purchase
program. Analysts say a policy shift would likely benefit the
dollar.
 ""There's a strong consensus that there will be some good
numbers coming out of the (U.S. on Friday) after that ADP
report, and expectation of a huge payrolls number is fueling
all sorts of dollar buying,"" said C.J. Gavsie, managing
director of FX sales at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
 The euro eased below support at $1.30 on Thursday, a key
level that suggests more losses are to come. The unit fell to
$1.2997 on trading platform EBS and last traded down 1 percent
at $1.3016.
 The next downside target is $1.2970, the euro/dollar's
December low, traders said.
 The euro came under heavy selling pressure after spreads
between peripheral euro zone government bond yields and
benchmark German debt widened on concerns about the region's
spreading debt crisis.
 A round of bond issues by peripheral euro zone economies
next week raised concerns about their high debt levels.
 That caused peripheral spreads to widen versus benchmark
German debt, hitting the euro zone single currency in a vicious
spiral.
 Traders said the euro's slide below its 200-day moving
average around $1.3081 accelerated its decline and some said
the euro could fall to $1.2575 in fairly short order.
 Greg Anderson, senior G10 FX strategist with CitiFX in New
York, said if Friday's payrolls report show non-farm payrolls
gains of above 200,000 for December, the euro/dollar will
likely break below $1.30 again and move to the December before
heading even lower from there.
 ""We are seeing a market correction right now that is more
in line with sovereign fundamentals,"" he said. ""The euro/dollar
should have never been at $1.34 at the end of December in the
first place,"" he said.
 Anderson also said the euro/dollar would have to drop to
the $1.2500 or $1.2550 level before buyers become aggressive
enough to take the market in another direction.
 ""Next week, the headlines and market angst surrounding
European sovereign issues will come back with a vengeance, and
I expect the euro/dollar to fall (to or even) below $1.25 by
the end of the month,"" he added.
 Options traders said there has been steady demand for
downside euro/dollar strikes around $1.26 over the next three
months as investors hedged against expectations that euro area
stresses will escalate.
 U.S. initial jobless claims rose more than expected in the
latest week, but a decline in the four-week average to a fresh
low of more than two years indicated that the labor market is
also on the mend.
 The jobless claims report followed ADP data showing U.S.
private sector employment posted a record increase last month
of 297,000 jobs.
 Traders said should this string of positive U.S. data
continue, the euro is likely to bear the brunt of the dollar's
rally.
 Another key event this week is Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's
testimony on the U.S. economic outlook before the Senate Budget
committee on Friday after the jobs report.

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a five-week
low against the dollar on Thursday on revived worries about the
euro zone's sovereign debt crisis, while stocks eased on softer
retail sales data before a U.S. employment report expected to
give direction to markets.
 Commodity prices' decline, including oil, helped the
inflation-wary U.S. government bond market.
 U.S. stock indices fell as major U.S. retailers missed Wall
Street estimates for December sales after a post-Christmas
blizzard slowed a two-month shopping spree, driving down
consumer shares.
 Expectations that Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls will show
a 175,000 gain in December magnified the dollar's strength
against the euro but left equity investors edgy.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 25.58
points, or 0.22 percent, at 11,697.31. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was down 2.71 points, or 0.21 percent, at
1,273.85. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 7.69
points, or 0.28 percent, at 2,709.89.
 ""The market has just been on a tear ... and a lot of
investors are probably sitting on their hands waiting for the
(jobs) report tomorrow,"" said Don Wordell, portfolio manager of
RidgeWorth MidCap Value Fund in Orlando, Florida.
 ""After the report on Wednesday, I would say the market
probably needs to see a private employment number close to
200,000 and the overall number better be up that high too. If
it's materially below that, I think that would be a reason for
the market to sell off.""
 The ADP Employer Services survey, which showed private
employers added 297,000 jobs last month, raised expectations
about Friday's broader employment report from the government.
 Some analysts are expecting employment gains of as much as
500,000.
 The front month futures contract for the Nikkei 225 stock
index <0#NK:> trading in Chicago fell 20 points to 10,520.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> dipped 0.2
percent. Emerging markets stocks <.MSCIEF> were down 0.5
percent on fears that record high food prices could stoke
inflation, protectionism and unrest in key emerging economies.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
finished up 0.4 percent at 1,147.23 points after touching
1,154.10, the highest since mid-September 2008.
 Spreads between peripheral euro zone government bond yields
and benchmark German debt widened as investors worried about
fresh supply next week from the region's higher-yielding
issuers.
 Wider spreads were driven by a rise in Portuguese debt
yields. [ID:nLIS002542] Debt auctions in Spain and Italy are
also scheduled for next week.
 ""It's a continuing concern about the refinancing risk for
euro zone countries in the next few weeks,"" said Samarjit
Shankar, managing director of global foreign exchange strategy
at BNY Mellon in Boston.
 ""In general, the euro is suffering from some fundamental
concerns about the sustainability of the currency itself in
terms of the sovereign debt crisis.""
 The euro fell to $1.2997 on trading platform EBS, its
weakest level in five weeks. It last traded down 0.99 percent
at $1.3008 .
 The dollar index <.DXY> was up 0.71 percent at 80.826.
 The dollar's rise reverberated throughout the commodities
market. U.S. light sweet crude oil futures  settled down
2.13 percent at $88.38 per barrel, and spot gold prices 
fell 0.4 percent to $1371.70.
 U.S. Treasury prices gained. The benchmark 10-year U.S.
Treasury note  was up 16/32, with the yield at 3.401
percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note  was up 2/32,
with the yield at 0.6767 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury
bond  was up 13/32, with the yield at 4.5141
percent.

 NEW YORK, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The euro slumped to a five-week

all sorts of dollar buying,"" said C.J. Gavsie, managing
director of FX sales at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
 The euro broke below support at $1.30 on Thursday,
suggesting more losses to come. It fell to $1.2997 on trading
platform EBS and last traded down 1 percent at $1.3018
.
 The next downside target is $1.2970, the euro/dollar's
December low, traders said.
 The euro came under heavy selling pressure after spreads
between peripheral euro zone government bond yields and
benchmark German debt widened on concerns about the region's
spreading debt crisis.
 A round of bond issues by peripheral euro zone economies
next week raised concerns about their high debt levels.
 That caused peripheral spreads to widen versus benchmark
German debt, hitting the euro zone single currency in a vicious
spiral. For details, see [ID:nLDE7051II]
 Traders said the euro's slide below its 200-day moving
average around $1.3081 accelerated its decline and some said
the euro could fall to $1.2575 in a fairly short order. 
 Options traders said there has been steady demand for
downside euro/dollar strikes around $1.26 over the next three
months as investors hedged against expectations that euro area
stresses will escalate.
 U.S. initial jobless claims rose more than expected in the
latest week, a decline in the four-week average to a fresh low
of more than two years indicated that the labor market is also
on the mend. [ID:nN06111595]
 The jobless claims report followed ADP data showing U.S.
private sector employment posted a record increase last month
of 297,000 jobs.
 Traders said should this string of positive U.S. data
continue, the euro is likely to bear the brunt of the dollar's
rally.
 ""If you consider the fact that the U.S. recovery is far
better than most major economies, then that kind of spells a
lower euro,"" said Tim O'Sullivan, chief dealer at Forex.com, a
division of Gain Capital in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 ""It is possible that the dollar is going to perform well
now because of fundamentals, and the euro is bearing the weight
of that right now.""
 Another key event this week is Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's
testimony on the U.S. economic outlook before the Senate Budget
committee on Friday after the jobs report.

 (Recasts, adds quotes, background)
 By Sara Webb and Ivana Sekularac
 ROTTERDAM, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The Dutch government must
address infrastructure problems and other bottlenecks around
Rotterdam port, Europe's biggest, that threaten its growth, the
head of the port said on Thursday.
 The port is investing 4 billion euros ($5.26 billion) over
the next few years on a massive land reclamation project and on
upgrading existing facilities, to increase capacity and cement
its position as a major transit point for commodities including
oil and grains, as well as for manufactured goods.
 But Hans Smits, the chief executive, told Reuters the port's
development could be hampered if the Dutch government does not
take faster steps to improve transport in the port area and
allow the use of wind turbines and carbon dioxide (CO2) storage.
 ""The sense of urgency in Europe needs to be on a higher
level,"" Smits said in an interview.
 ""In the Netherlands, don't take it for granted that it's
going well in our port. We have to speed up our development.""
 Top of Smits' list for the government are a road and tunnel
project that would relieve congestion around the port,
legislation on storage of greenhouse gas CO2, and faster
processing of permits to set up wind turbines next to the port's
new land reclamation project, Maasvlakte 2, to provide power.
 ""It takes too much bureaucracy, too much talk to realise
it,"" he said. ""Investing in transport infrastructure is one of
the best means you can take to stimulate economic growth. I'm
always surprised politicians do not realise that.""
 Smits said that the government needs to change legislation
to resolve uncertainty over liability if CO2 is stored in
depleted oil and gas fields in the North Sea.
 Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a pioneering technology
which involves trapping CO2 emissions from industrial processes
and piping them underground or offshore below the seabed.
 Smits advocated a special tripartite agreement to clear the
way if legislation on CO2 legislation takes too long to amend.
 ""If you can't solve it in a legal way, then make a special
arrangement between the government, the energy companies and the
owners of the oil and gas fields to solve the issue"", allowing
CO2 produced by activities in the port to be stored, he said.
 The Dutch government recently shelved a plan to store CO2
underground in the town of Barendrecht in the west, because of
local opposition, but said it remains committed to CO2 storage. 
 Some environmentalists say CCS is unsafe and could divert
investment away from truly green sources of power. 
 The Rotterdam area, a major hub for oil, coal and biofuels,
produces about 16 percent of the Netherlands' total CO2
emissions, and is counting on CCS to help it halve emissions in
the area by 2025 compared to 1990 levels.
 
 EXPANSION
 Rotterdam expects the first ships to berth at Maasvlakte 2
in 2013. The land reclamation project will increase the port's
area by a fifth by the time it is completed in 2033-2035,
allowing it attract new business.
 The port is investing 2 billion euros in Maasvlakte 2, part
of a total 15 billion euros investment by the government,
private sector and port. 
 Funding is already in place, Smits said, and ruled out the
need to seek a stock market listing or equity from Chinese or
other companies that use the port.
 ""Because of the importance of the port to the Dutch economy
it wouldn't be wise to have shareholders who also have
commercial interests because then you lose your neutrality.""
 But he said Chinese companies are still interested in
investing in the port's facilities, adding that China's Sinopec
Corp is one of the potential bidders for a tank terminal tender
this year.
 The Chinese oil refiner wants to use Rotterdam as an oil
hub, bringing in crude oil from Russia, blending it in Rotterdam
before sending to China, he said.
 Rotterdam is also keen to invest abroad as a means to
bringing in new business: it has two joint ventures in Oman that
Smits said had led to consultancy work in Qatar, potentially
opening the door for Qatar to supply liquefied natural gas (LNG)
through Rotterdam port where an LNG terminal will be finished
this year.
 Rotterdam has scrapped plans to invest in a Malaysian port
but expects to announce a joint venture in Brazil and investment
in India this year, he said.
 Smits also said he expected container growth this year of
between 4 and 5 percent, reflecting growth in world trade and an
increase in market share.
 Rotterdam last week reported bumper cargo volumes, up 11.1
percent to a record 430 million tonnes in 2010, thanks to a
recovery in global trade and a thriving German economy.
 It also said last week that cargo volumes passing through
Rotterdam port are expected to rise between 2 and 3 percent to
about 440 million tonnes in 2011.

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar on Thursday and European government bond yields jumped
as investor concerns re-emerged over the mounting bill for
rescuing some euro zone countries and Europe's financial
sector.
 U.S. stocks mostly fell as some big U.S. retailers missed
Wall Street estimates for December sales after a post-Christmas
blizzard slowed a two-month shopping spree, driving down
consumer shares. Energy shares declined along with oil prices.
 Spreads between peripheral euro zone government bond yields
and benchmark German debt widened as investors became spooked
at the prospect of fresh supply next week from the region's
higher-yielding issuers.
 Wider spreads were driven by a rise in Portuguese debt
yields as that country's IGCP debt agency said it will issue
between 750 million euros and 1.25 billion euros in two bond
maturities at an auction on Jan. 12. For details, see
[ID:nLIS002542]
 Debt auctions in Spain and Italy are also scheduled for
next week.
 ""It's continuing concern about the refinancing risk for
euro zone countries in the next few weeks,"" said Samarjit
Shankar, managing director of global foreign exchange strategy
at BNY Mellon in Boston.
 ""In general, the euro is suffering from some fundamental
concerns about the sustainability of the currency itself in
terms of the sovereign debt crisis.""
 The euro fell to $1.2997 on trading platform EBS, its
weakest level in five weeks. It last traded down down 1.2
percent at $1.3002 .
 The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value
against a basket of major currencies <.DXY> was up 0.68 percent
at 80.800.
 The dollar's rise was bolstered by generally upbeat U.S.
data and ahead of Friday's U.S. payrolls report, which is
expected to show job gains of 175,000 in December, according to
a Reuters poll. Some analysts are expecting employment gains of
as much as 500,000.
 U.S. stocks eased as disappointing sales from top retailers
dented hopes about the holiday shopping season.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 42.04
points, or 0.36 percent, at 11,680.85. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was down 4.44 points, or 0.35 percent, at
1,272.12. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 3.31
points, or 0.12 percent, at 2,705.51.
 European stocks, however, closed at their highest in nearly
28 months on expectations for renewed U.S. economic growth.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
finished 0.4 percent higher at 1,147.23 after touching
1,154.10, the highest since September 2008.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> dipped 0.2
percent. Emerging markets stocks <.MSCIEF> were down 0.5

 U.S. light sweet crude oil futures  fell $1.91, or
2.12 percent, to $88.39 per barrel. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The euro tumbled to a five-week
low against the dollar on Thursday and further losses were seen
likely as a round of bond issues next week by peripheral euro
zone economies raised concern about their high debt levels.
 That caused peripheral spreads to widen versus benchmark
German debt, hitting the euro zone single currency in a vicious
spiral.
 The euro is holding above $1.30 but if that level goes,
some traders said it could fall to $1.2575 in fairly short
order.
 ""It's continuing concern about the refinancing risk for
euro zone countries in the next few weeks,"" said Samarjit
Shankar, managing director of global FX strategy at BNY Mellon
in Boston.
 ""In general, the euro is suffering from some fundamental
concerns about the sustainability of the currency itself in
terms of the sovereign debt crisis.""
 Magnifying the euro's fall was continued outperformance of
the dollar amid optimism about the U.S. economy, which is
expected to report on Friday job gains of 175,000 for December,
according to a Reuters poll. Some in the market are expecting
employment gains of as much as 500,000.
 ""There's a strong consensus that there will be some good
numbers coming out of the States tomorrow after that ADP
report, and expectation of a huge payrolls number is fueling
all sorts of dollar buying,"" said C.J. Gavsie, managing
director of FX sales at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
 In midday New York trading, the euro was down 1 percent at
$1.3017 The euro also slid below its 200-day moving average
around $1.3081, which accelerated its decline, with the
currency falling as low as $1.3005.
 Options traders said there has been steady demand for
downside euro/dollar strikes around $1.26 over the next three
months as investors hedged against expectations that euro area
stresses will escalate.
 The next big level is $1.2970, the December 2010 low.
 Thursday's U.S. data was also generally supportive of the
dollar. Although U.S. initial jobless claims rose more than
expected in the latest week, a decline in the four-week average
to a fresh low of more than two years indicated that the labor
market is also on the mend.
 The jobless claims report followed ADP data showing U.S.
private sector employment posted a record increase last month
of 297,000 jobs.
 Traders said should this string of positive U.S. data
continue, the euro is likely to bear the brunt of the dollar's

 The dollar slipped 0.1 percent against the yen to 83.17,
which many traders believed was just a temporary blip.
 Currency models from Credit Suisse suggested that if
current U.S. bond yields hold, dollar/yen should rise to 89.5
or higher. And even if U.S. two-year yields retrace some of
their recent gains, dollar/yen's fair value is estimated at
85.6, the bank said in a note.
 The ICE Futures' dollar index, which measures the
greenback's value against a basket of major currencies, was up
0.6 percent at 80.757, a sharp turnaround from last week's
78.775 trough.

 * BoE to face growing pressure to raise rates as CPI surges
 
 By David Milliken
 LONDON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Britons are likely to feel worse
off in 2011 despite a growing economy. And the Bank of England
will probably not raise interest rates until months after a
surge in inflation has passed its peak.
 These two paradoxes are likely to dominate the economy over
the next 12 months, and have already been highlighted by data
released in the first few days of this year.
 Goods for export rather than services enjoyed at home are
driving economic growth for the first time since Britain's
recovery from its last recession in the mid-1990s. 
 And if measures of public inflation expectations are taken
at face value, people are already losing confidence in the BoE's
ability to keep price pressures under control.
 Growth in 2011 is likely to broadly maintain 2010's tepid
pace as Britain recovers from its deepest recession since World
War Two. Its independent government forecasting unit, the Office
for Budget Responsibility, predicted in late November that the
economy would grow 2.1 percent this year after 1.8 percent
growth in 2010.
 Most economists think this is too optimistic -- the average
forecast in a Reuters poll of 41 economists last month was for
growth to pick up only fractionally to 1.9 percent in 2011.
 ""Given the scale of the recession, it is a somewhat
indifferent recovery,"" said Ross Walker, an economist at Royal
Bank of Scotland.
 But worse is the fact that for many households 2011 will
feel more like a recession than it did in 2009, when the economy
shrank by 4.9 percent, its biggest annual drop in at least 60
years.
 Government and business bore the brunt of the recession,
when unemployment rose by a comparatively small amount, and
consumers benefited from a sharp fall in interest rates and a
temporary cut in sales tax.
 Now it is pay-back time. To reduce a government budget
deficit that was the highest in 2009/10 of any major economy,
value-added tax on most goods and services rose on Tuesday to 20
percent from 17.5 percent. 
 This year the government also starts a four-year programme
of spending cuts that will reduce the budgets of most government
departments by just under a fifth, which the OBR forecasts will
reduce public sector employment by more than 300,000.
 And the much-vaunted 'rebalancing' of the economy will mean
that Britons will increasingly be making goods for foreigners
rather than producing services for each other.
 December purchasing managers' data released this week showed
the first fall in services activity since the end of the
recession -- albeit partly due to heavy snow -- while factory
activity growth powered to its highest in 16 years.
 RBS's Walker predicted that consumption growth would slow to
0.6 percent in 2011 from 1.1 percent in 2010.
 ""For the household sector it was a 'pain postponed'
recession. This year, although it will be better in terms of
evidence of major rebalancing, it will feel like a recession.""
 
 INFLATION DILEMMA
 For the Bank of England, 2011 heightens a dilemma that was
becoming increasingly acute towards the end of last year.
Inflation was at least a percentage point above the BoE's 2
percent target throughout 2010, and is forecast to approach 4
percent early this year after the VAT rise.
 Yet interest rates are still at a record low of 0.5 percent,
the same level as at the depth of the recession, and the BoE has
no apparent intention to raise them soon.
 Any interest rate rises take more than a year to slow
inflation, and the BoE -- like most economists -- forecasts
inflation will fall back to 2 percent in early 2012 of its own
accord as the VAT rise and other one-off effects fade.
 The problem with this theory comes when the public do not
believe it. Workers may press for higher wage rises and
businesses could try to raise prices to preserve margins.
 The first part of this process now appears to be happening.
This week's purchasing managers' surveys showed the fastest rise
in input costs in years, and a YouGov poll of public inflation
expectations showed them at a two-year high at 3.5 percent for
the next 12 months and 3.8 percent for the next 5-10 years.
 For now, the economy appears too weak for the second stage
of the inflation spiral to take place. The purchasing managers'
indexes showed firms largely absorbing cost increases, and wage
deals, though at a post-recession high, are well below
inflation.
 But pressure on the BoE will rise as inflation increases.
 ""It's going to feel a very uncomfortable few months for
them,"" said Nomura economist Philip Rush, who expects inflation
to peak at 3.9 percent next month.
 ""Inflation expectations are a real threat to their
credibility. But with downside risks particularly large in the
first half of the year, they are probably going to wait to see
how it plays out before hiking in August 2011.""
 A Reuters poll on Thursday showed most economists still
expect the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee to wait until
the last three months of the year before raising rates. Tighter
policy will come when growth is normal, rather than when
inflation is abnormal.
 ""It's a muddy picture but I don't think they will hike
before the fourth quarter,"" said RBS's Walker. ""Growth in the
first and second quarters will be pretty anaemic.""

 MORE ACTIVITIES OFF NORWAY
 BG is planning to expand further its activities off the
coast of the Nordic country, where it arrived in 2004.
 It expects its Gaupe field, in which it has a 60 percent
stake with Stockholm-listed Lundin holding the remainder, to
come on stream by the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2011.
 ""We will have a net production from Gaupe and Jordbaer that
will total about 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day ... by
2014,"" Roger Tucker, BG's head of European activities, told
Reuters.
 He said BG was also eyeing developing a third field, Bream,
off Norway, which could add an extra 12,000 barrels of oil
equivalent in net daily output.
 The firm was planning to drill four wells in the coming
months, including one at Gullris in the Norwegian Sea at the end
of the first quarter and one at a field nearby Jordbaer, called
Jordbaer West, in August.
 BG had high expectations for the Gullris well since it was
near Gro, a significant discovery recently made by Royal Dutch
Shell.
 BG's capital expenditure in Norway would be at least 8.5
billion Norwegian crowns, Tucker said, with an additional 5
billion expected if Jordbaer West proved an interesting field.
 The company's global output is expect to reach one million
barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2014, Tucker added.

 By Manuela Badawy and Jeremy Gaunt
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - U.S., European and
Japanese stocks climbed on Thursday on expectations for renewed
U.S. economic growth, while emerging markets slipped on
concerns about rising food prices.
 The dollar rose against the euro after U.S. data showed
jobless claims rose more than expected last week, but the
four-week average fell to its lowest in more than two years,
indicating the labor market continued to improve. For details,
see [ID:nN05283244]
 U.S. Treasuries edged up, with yields coming off highs
reached the previous day after surprisingly strong U.S. private
employment data, but remained vulnerable ahead of Friday's
government non-farm payrolls report.
 Jobs are often a lagging indicator of economic health and
improvement can show the recovery is becoming more
sustainable.
 U.S. private employers added 297,000 jobs in December,
according to Wednesday's ADP Employer Services report, nearly
triple forecasts.
 ""Claims today are overshadowed by the large surprise from
the ADP report yesterday,"" said Zach Pandl, economist at Nomura
Securities International Inc in New York.
 ""Markets in our view are looking for a very strong
confirmation of the labor market rebound. We think tomorrow is
going to be supportive of an ongoing recovery and greater
momentum in general in the economy.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dipped 12.26
points, or 0.10 percent, to 11,710.63. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.GSPC> was off 1.41 points, or 0.11 percent, to
1,275.15. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> added 4.78 points,
or 0.18 percent, to 2,706.98.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were up
0.2 percent, mainly on gains in Japan and Europe. Emerging
markets stocks <.MSCIEF> were down 0.5 percent.
 Food prices rose to a record high last month, the United
Nations' food agency said this week. Emerging markets are
traditionally more susceptible to the food inflation.
 Developed markets were bullish. The pan-European
FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was up 0.7 percent for a more than
2.7 percent rise so far this year.
 Euro zone economic sentiment jumped in December, mainly on
a sharp increase in optimism in industry and the retail sector,
but inflation expectations also surged.
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> stormed to an eight-month closing
high, up 1.4 percent for a nearly 3 percent gain in three
sessions.
 DOLLAR UP
 The dollar was higher against the euro, bolstered by
generally upbeat U.S. data. Investors however, were focused on
the U.S. payrolls report, which is expected to show job gains
of 175,000 in December.
 ""The market expects a significantly strong figure for
Friday's payrolls, but they could be overestimating. So there
is scope for disappointment,"" said Lee Hardman, currency
economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value
against a basket of major currencies, was 0.3 percent higher at
80.48 <.DXY>, a sharp turnaround from last week's 78.775
trough.
 But investors were reluctant to chase the dollar much
higher ahead of the payrolls data.
 The euro fell 0.56 percent to $1.3075. 
 Currency markets digested moves by Brazil's central bank to
curb speculation with a reserve requirement on bank short
dollar positions. The local real, which up sharply along with
many emerging market currencies, fell.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices rose as investors shopped for
bargains after the ADP report and looked ahead to the Friday
data.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
4/32, with the yield at 3.446 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury
note  added 1/32, with the yield at 0.6926 percent.
The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was down 5/32, with
the yield at 4.5509 percent.
 The dollar's strength and the data that suggested the U.S.
economy was gaining traction kept commodities and energy prices
pressured.
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  fell $1.55, or 1.7
percent, to $88.75 per barrel, and spot gold prices 
dropped $9.20, or 0.7 percent, to $1,367.60 an ounce.

 * Axel Weber still economists' tip to succeed Trichet
 
 By Andy Bruce
 LONDON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will
hold interest rates until the fourth quarter of this year,
according to a Reuters poll of economists who said Germany's
Axel Weber is still firm favourite to become its next president.
 While private sector business surveys this week showed
France and Germany spearheading the euro zone's economic
recovery, the debt crisis in the bloc's periphery is expected to
keep interest rates at record lows deep into 2011.
 The survey of 71 economists showed the ECB holding rates at
1.0 percent until the fourth quarter, during which they see a 25
basis point hike -- a quarter sooner than forecast in December's
long-term economy poll.
 Much of the latest survey was conducted after the release of
Tuesday's December inflation data, which showed euro zone prices
rose 2.2 percent year-on-year -- more than expected by
economists and above the ECB's near-two percent ceiling.
 ""2011 will prove a difficult test for the ECB given the
diverging economic performances within a one-size-fits-all
monetary policy area,"" said Investec economist Philip Shaw.
 While the ECB has made a point of insisting it can run
liquidity and monetary policy seperately, Shaw said it would
face a huge challenge if German wage inflation, for instance,
starts to increase while peripheral countries struggle.
 The poll, taken this week, showed interest rates staying at
1.25 percent in the first quarter of 2012, before rising to 1.50
percent in the second quarter.
 A majority of respondents who answered an extra question
said Portugal would need an EU-led bailout similar to those
taken by Ireland and Greece last year.
 ECB Governing Council member Axel Weber remains the most
likely choice to replace ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, the
poll showed. Trichet's final term runs out at the end of
October.
 Twenty-six out of 42 economists thought Bundesbank chief
Weber the most likely successor, with 10 naming his Italian ECB
colleague Mario Draghi and six citing others such as Klaus
Regling, head of the European Financial Stability Facility.
 While still the clear favourite, Weber's majority has shrunk
noticeably from September, when 40 out of 45 tipped him to head
the ECB.
 Since then, Weber's public critique of the central bank's
bond purchase programme appears to have dented his chances. In
October he put himself at odds with the views of his Governing
Council colleagues and Trichet himself.
 Last month, German Chancellor Angela Merkel refused to
speculate on a possible Weber succession, saying it was not yet
on the agenda.

 * German minister sees wages rising ""considerably""
 * Peripheral euro zone economies still mired in gloom
 * Rate hike unlikely yet, but inflation a policy challenge
 
 By Paul Carrel
 FRANKFURT, Jan 6 (Reuters) - A rise in euro zone inflation
and expectations for big German wage gains present the European
Central Bank with the conundrum of how to keep prices in check
without throttling the region's fragile peripheral economies.
 ECB policymakers returned from their holidays this week to a
report showing euro zone inflation jumped above the central
bank's target in December, while inflation expectations also
surged in the last month of 2010.
 The jump in inflation raises the chances that the ECB will
hike rates earlier than previously expected to choke off price
pressures in Germany, while at the same time leaving in place
other measures to support peripheral economies.
 ""In my view the current monetary policy rate is already too
low for the German economy but it's probably too restrictive for
the Irish, Portugese and Spanish economies,"" said Carsten
Brzeski, senior economist at ING.
 ""This idea that one size fits all is, right now, a policy
where one size doesn't fit anyone,"" he added. ""Inflation will
become a hot topic in the coming months and will really give the
policymakers in Frankfurt a hard time.""
 A Reuters poll of economists released on Thursday showed the
ECB holding rates at 1.0 percent until the fourth quarter,
during which they see a 25 basis point hike -- a quarter sooner
than forecast in December's long-term economy poll. The ECB
held its main rate at 1 percent for the 19th month in a row in
December. Raising rates now to cool price pressures in Germany
is the last thing peripheral euro zone economies need as they
battle with a sovereign debt crisis.
 While manufacturing orders and other data this week have
shown Germany's recovery steaming ahead, all but a handful of
analysts polled by Reuters forecast Portugal will need to be
bailed out.
 Some 7 of 51 now say Spain will follow and it is both
countries' inability to generate strong growth which lies at the
heart of their troubles. Spain's services sector shrank at its
fastest pace in a year in December.
 Germany's labour minister said in comments published earlier
this week that she expects wages will rise ""considerably"" in the
euro zone's largest economy this year.
 
 GERMAN ANGST
 In principle, higher wages and inflation in Germany and
deflation in peripheral economies are what is needed to
rebalance the euro zone economy, boosting German domestic demand
and making exporters in the weaker economies more competitive.
 But Germans' deep-seated fear of inflation -- a legacy of
Germany's hyper-inflation in the 1920s, when a wheelbarrow full
of money was needed to buy a loaf of bread -- means they expect
the ECB to act to keep a lid on prices.
 ""There are very divergent developments here and it makes it
very, very difficult to set the right policy rates,"" said
Citigroup economist Juergen Michels.
 To assuage Germans' inflation angst and tackle the euro zone
debt crisis at the same time, the ECB could start to hike
interest rates while keeping in place some of the measures it
introduced to combat the financial crisis.
 ""They have to find a balance between getting things right in
terms of inflation and ... having the right kind of measures to
support the strained periphery countries,"" said Michels.
 ""That may mean something like still having quite a few
non-standard measures in place when hiking rates.""
 The ECB said after its December policy meeting it would keep
giving banks unlimited liquidity well into next year, conducting
three month liquidity operations in January, February and March
""with full allotment"".
 
 EXCESS LIQUIDITY
 Providing euro zone banks with ample liquidity gives the
weaker lenders the funds to stay afloat.
 But excess liquidity in euro zone money markets -- which
Reuters calculation show currently stands at about 50 billion
euros -- makes it harder for the ECB to get a grip on market
interest rates via its policy transmission mechanism.
 Key euro-priced bank-to-bank lending rates fell further
below the ECB's 1.0 percent main rate on Thursday, pushed down
by the high level of excess liquidity in the market.
 ""It complicates things,"" Brzeski said of the impact of the
ECB's policy of meeting all requests for funding at its money
market tenders. But the bank has also signalled that the cost of
that cash will rise if its main rate rises -- likely pulling up
market rates with it. 
 ""If you increased the refi (main refinancing rate), I think
market rates would probably follow,"" Brzeski added. ""With full
allotment it's highly likely they will continue to trade below
the refi but I think they would go up in parallel.""
 Despite the jump in euro zone inflation to 2.2 percent in
December, economists expect the ECB to keep rates on hold well
into 2011.
 ""We're at a very early stage in this, we've only had one
month of above-target inflation,"" said Nick Kounis at ABN Amro.
 Brzeski agreed: ""In the short term, I don't see any risk
that they would hike interest rates but if the current trend
were to continue I think there is a risk they would go for the
symbolic act and hike very cautiously, but at the same time keep
the full allotment in place to support the banking system.""

 * Many countries have double-digit food inflation
 * Asia faces policy dilemma on how to handle price rises
 * Indonesia calls on households to plant food
 * India reports food prices rise more than 18 pct on year
 By Neil Fullick and Peter Apps
 SINGAPORE/LONDON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Record high food prices
are moving to the top of policymaker agendas, driven by fears
it could stoke inflation, protectionism and unrest and dent
consumer demand in key emerging economies.
 The United Nations' food agency (FAO) said on Wednesday
that food prices hit a record high last month, above 2008
levels when riots broke out in countries as far afield as
Egypt, Cameroon and Haiti.
 In Asia, official data and analyst estimates both pointed
to inflationary pressures. Chilli prices have increased
fivefold in Thailand in the last year and Indonesia's president
called for households to plant food in their own gardens.
 President Susilo Yudhoyono Bambang told a cabinet meeting
people should be ""creative"" in planting, with Trade Minister
Mari Pangestu leading the way in planting at home.
 ""I have 200 chilli plants in flowerpots,"" Pangestu told a
briefing on Thursday. ""The agriculture ministry is informing
farmers how to take care of the plant and also encouraging
consumers to plant chilli in their own yards.""
 Surging food prices have often provoked unrest in urban
areas of poor countries, where food makes up a high proportion
of household purchases.
 Analysts say African and Caribbean economies dependent on
food exports could be particularly hard hit, helping stoke
unrest and potentially pushing governments towards imposing
export bans and expropriating foreign-owned farmland.
 If Asian and other emerging consumers have to spend more of
their income on food, other purchases will fall -- and that
could be bad news for a global economy that has placed much of
its hopes for recovery on consumption in developing economies.
 World Bank President Robert Zoellick urged governments in a
newspaper opinion column to avoid protectionist measures as
food prices rose and called upon the Group of 20 leading
economies to take steps to make sure the poor get adequate food
supplies.
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy has asked the World Bank
to conduct urgent research on the impact of food prices ahead
of G20 meetings later this year, a source familiar with the
matter said.
 INDIAN INTEREST RATE PRESSURE
 Food price protests were seen a factor in the ousting of
Indonesia's long-term autocrat Suharto in 1998, and anger over
a farmland purchased by South Korean firm Daewoo at a time of
rising prices was in part blamed for a 2009 coup in
Madagascar.
 India's food price inflation rose to a one-year high of
more than 18 percent in the year to the end of December, data
on Thursday showed. That, along with rising fuel prices, is the
main reason analysts expect the central bank to raise rates
this month.
 The Indian government has used a range of measures for
years to ensure stable food prices, but since last year has
boosted the release of national stocks of grains and has
pledged to continue duty-free imports of crude vegetable oils.
 In China, several cities have implemented direct controls
to limit food price increases and the central government has
vowed to eliminate speculation in the country's commodities
markets.
 The cost of food rose 11.7 percent in the year to November,
while non-food items were up just 1.9 percent. But, reflecting
concerns that inflation is creeping beyond food to the wider
economy, consumer goods prices and housing costs showed clear
jumps.
 Fu Bingtao, an economist with the Agricultural Bank of
China in Beijing, said in a report the price of grains, the
country's most important food, would rise in 2011 by 10
percent, adding to an 11.7 percent rise in 2010.
 ""Speculative trading and hoarding of specific agricultural
products may continue,"" he said.
 The FAO said sugar and meat were at their highest since its
records began in 1990. Prices were at their highest since 2008
crisis levels for wheat, rice, corn and other cereals.
 Benchmark prices solely in Asia for rice suggested a
different picture.
 The region's staple food now stands at $535 per tonne --
less than half its 2008 levels of more than $1,000 a tonne that
prompted several governments at the time to impose curbs on
exports to protect their domestic markets.
 ASIAN POLICY DILEMMA
 But most experts expect upwards price pressure to continue,
particularly if countries slap on export bans and further
squeeze supply, and short-term investors again buy into
agricultural commodities as they did in 2008.
 Last year, wheat futures prices rose 47 percent, buoyed by
a series of weather events including drought in Russia and its
Black Sea neighbours. U.S. corn rose more than 50 percent and
U.S. soybeans jumped 34 percent.
 Alongside bad weather in Australia, Europe, North America
and Argentina, rising Asian demand is at the heart of the
spike. China, for example, is expected to buy 60 percent of
globally traded soybeans in 2011/12, double its purchase of
four years ago.
 Dry, hot weather has hit soy and corn crops in Argentina, a
leading exporter, fueling a rally in U.S. grains futures in
recent weeks on supply fears. After an uneasy start, climate
conditions have improved in neighboring Brazil, the world's No.
2 soy provider.
 Higher interest rates do little to ease pressure on food
prices. Demand is inelastic because people have to eat, but
current price pressures are largely supply-led, so tighter
monetary policy would not directly help.
 The danger, however, is that food inflation spreads to the
wider economy.
 ""I think there's an urgent need to be more pre-emptive in
tightening monetary policy to prevent some of these inflation
pressures from erupting,"" said Frederic Neumann, regional
economist at HSBC in Hong Kong.
 Some central banks had taken some action but more needed to
be done.
 South Korea, like other Asian countries that run trade and
current account surpluses, could give more room to its currency
to rise to offset rising import costs on food.
 But higher interest rates or the likelihood of a rising
currency would just encourage a flood of portfolio capital from
investors spurning sluggish growth in developed economies. And
rising currency could hurt exports, the major pillar of many
economies.

 By Isabel Versiani and Ana Nicolaci da Costa
 BRASILIA, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Brazil made its boldest move so
far to curb gains in the real on Thursday, imposing reserve
requirements on banks' short positions on U.S. dollars in a bid
to reduce speculative trade.
 The decision came just days after Finance Minister Guido
Mantega said the new government would act to protect local
manufacturers but does not plan any new taxes on foreign
investments or other capital controls unless the real
strengthens further.
 The central bank imposed reserve requirements equivalent to
60 percent of whatever is smaller: a short position on U.S.
dollars of $3 billion or the bank's reference capital. The
measure will be effective as of April 4, the central bank said.
 The surprise move will make it more expensive for banks to
bet against the dollar. Short positions on dollars, a bet the
real will strengthen against the greenback, surged to the
highest on record at the end of December.
 Brazil's currency weakened sharply on the futures market
after the announcement, with the near-date real futures contract
weakening 0.51 percent to 1.691 on news of the move.
 ""It should have a noticeable effect on the currency,"" said
Luciano Rostagno, chief strategist at brokerage CM Capital
Markets in Sao Paulo . ""The government has been indicating that
it was not happy with the real close to 1.65.""
 The real closed at 1.673 per dollar in local market trading
on Wednesday. The real is the world's most overvalued major
currency by some measures, according to Goldman Sachs.
 
 SHORT POSITIONS
 Brazil is one of a number of major emerging economies
battling the impact of a flood of cheap cash due to ultra-low
Western interest rates. The speculative flow has driven up their
currencies and prompted fears it could weaken exports and
competitiveness.
 Mantega said on Tuesday President Dilma Rousseff's
newly-installed government would address the damage caused by
its strong currency by enacting tax breaks and trade protection,
rather than attempting to artificially weaken the exchange rate.
 Banks' short positions on U.S. dollars, a bet that the real
will strengthen versus the dollar, have surged in recent months
to $16.8 billion at the end of December, the highest volume
since the central bank began keeping track of the data in 1994.
 Central bank monetary policy Director Aldo Mendes estimated
short positions should fall to around $10 billion after the
measure.
 The real gained 4.6 percent in 2010 and has surged by just
over 14 percent since hitting a low in May of last year.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The dollar edged up on Thursday,
having surged the previous day on strong U.S. private sector
jobs data, but there is a risk it could pull back if Friday's
broader payroll numbers aren't similarly robust.
 A string of robust U.S. data have driven the dollar higher
and underpinned expectations that the world's largest economy
would recover faster than other major economies.
 The ADP jobs report on Wednesday showed a record 297,000
private-sector jobs were created in December, boosting
expectations for Friday's official jobs report. U.S. factory and
services sectors' data this week has also buoyed the greenback.
 The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value
against a basket of major currencies, was up 0.2 percent at
80.40, a sharp turnaround from last week's 78.775 trough.
 ""There have been positive developments for the U.S. economy
pointing to a more sustained recovery, whereas investors remain
concerned about developments in the UK and Europe,"" said Lee
Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 ""The market expects a significantly strong figure for
Friday's payrolls, but they could be overestimating. So there is
scope for disappointment,"" he added.
 The ADP report drove the dollar's 1.5 percent gain versus
the yen on Wednesday, its biggest one-day rise in three months,
although dollar-selling by Japanese exporters tempered gains.
The dollar shed some of those gains, and was down 0.2 percent on
the day at 83.11 yen.
 But the dollar extended gains against the euro, with the
single currency down 0.3 percent at $1.3110. Traders were
focusing on a digital option at $1.3125 worth some 20 million
euros set to expire at 1500 GMT. This is expected to keep the
single currency in a range.
 The next downside target is at $1.3080, the euro's 200-day
moving average.
 The single currency got a brief boost after Spanish
newspaper El Pais reported that China was willing to buy about 6
billion euros of Spanish government debt.
 But it barely reacted to mixed economic data that showed
euro zone economic sentiment jumping in December although retail
sales fell in November.
 France saw a smooth auction of 8.975 billion euros worth of
10-, 15- and 20-year government bonds.
 
 DOLLAR STRENGTH
 While the euro is likely to struggle under the burden of
rising euro zone government debt issuances in the coming months,
investors will focus on the strength of forthcoming U.S. data
and whether an economic recovery in 2011 is durable or not.
Crucial to that recovery is the U.S. labour market. U.S.
payrolls on Friday are expected to show overall gains of 175,000
jobs for December, up from a 140,000 forecast prior to the ADP
data.
 ""A number around 200,000 would likely spur profit-taking. A
positive surprise of 250,000-300,000 is needed to spur the
dollar higher,"" one London-based trader said.
 Even then, the dollar's gains could be limited unless the
data changes expectations for the U.S. Federal Reserve to keep
its quantitative easing in place through June.
 ""The release earlier this week of the minutes of the
December FOMC meeting made clear that by last month the Fed did
not view economic conditions as having improved enough to reign
in the $600 bln target for QE2,"" said Jane Foley, senior
currency strategist at Rabobank.
 ""One strong payrolls release would most likely be
insufficient to cause the Fed to change policy.""
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is set to testify on the economic
outlook before the Senate Budget Committee on Friday after the
jobs report.
 Sterling fell after an unexpected contraction in UK service
sector output added to concerns over a fledgling economic
recovery in Britain. The pound fell more than half a cent versus
the dollar to trade at $1.5480, down around 0.2 percent on the
day. It had shed nearly one percent on Wednesday.

 By Aaron Gray-Block
 AMSTERDAM, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Loss-making Dutch car maker
Spyker said it was confident sales at its Swedish unit Saab
would accelerate this year after meeting its lowered 2010
guidance, boosting its shares on Thursday.
 Luxury carmaker Spyker defied sceptics last year when it
rescued Saab from a looming closure and has remained bullish on
its prospects in the face of massive challenges, forecasting
sales to rise this year to 80,000 and 120,00 in 2012.
 The company said late on Wednesday, Saab sold 31,696 cars
over 2010 after cutting its full-year target in October to
30,000 to 35,000 units, from 45,000 previously, because it had
to rebuild its supplier base after Spyker bought Saab from
General Motors.
 But Saab sold 11,448 cars in the fourth quarter, up 129
percent compared with the same period in 2009 and up 31 percent
quarter-on-quarter.
 ""There's still room for improvement. I think it took quite
some time to get things up and running in a normal way and they
still have a long way to go,"" AEK analyst Martin Crum said.
 ""2011 will be the first normal year in terms of production
and that should show a strong improvement considering 2010, but
by how much will it be? We will have to wait and see.""
 Shares in Spyker Cars were up 8.03 percent at 4.05 euros at
1034 GMT to outperform a 0.34 percent gain on the Amsterdam
small-cap index
 
 PRODUCT OFFENSIVE
 Spyker said after production was severely disrupted at the
start of 2010, Saab continued to see sales momentum increase
quarter by quarter in several key markets.
 ""I am confident that we can keep up the current sales
momentum as we continue to enhance our offering with the biggest
ever product offensive in Saab Automobile's history,"" Saab Chief
Executive Jan Ake Jonsson said in a statement.
 Saab's factory was closed for eight weeks at the start of
2010 as GM had been preparing to wind the business down prior to
the last-minute rescue offer from Spyker, and a lot of suppliers
had also closed production.
 The company said it will continue to expand its distribution
network in China and Russia and that it expects to see the full
effects in 2011 of its entry last year into markets such as
Japan, Canada, Portugal and Australia.

 LONDON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Oil fell more than a dollar to
below $89 a barrel after U.S. data showed more jobless claims
than expected, raising doubts about the strength of economic
recovery in the world's biggest oil burner.
 U.S. crude for February was down $1.40 a barrel at $88.90 a
barrel at 1509 GMT, while Brent for February was 36 cents at
$95.14.
Both contracts weakened after a U.S. government report said
U.S. initial weekly jobless claims for unemployment benefit had
risen to 409,000 last week, outpacing the consensus forecast for
400,000..
 The market might, however, be more influenced by Friday's
U.S. non-farm payroll data and any dips below $90 could be
quickly reversed, traders and analysts said, as they maintained
a bullish outlook for U.S. fuel demand.
 ""We think tomorrow is going to be supportive of ongoing
recovery and greater momentum in general in the economy,"" said
Zach Pandl, an economist at Nomura Securities International in
New York. 
 ""Markets in our view are looking for a very strong
confirmation of the labour market rebound.""
 Expectations of economic recovery and with it rising fuel
demand helped to drive oil to a 27-month high of $92.58 on
Tuesday, but in volatile trade, prices fell to a low of $88.10
on Wednesday.
 Analysts said there could be some price distortion this week
as the big investment indexes rebalance their crude futures
weightings.
 ""The rebalancing period is well flagged and as such, some of
the recent moves in the market are likely to reflect the
anticipated rebalancing to some extent,"" said James Zhang, an
analyst at Standard Bank Commodities Research.
 Earlier on Thursday, Eurozone consumer confidence and
economic sentiment data painted a mixed picture, with the former
slipping back in December from November's 35-month high, whilst
economic sentiment spiked to a 38-month high in December.
 Concerns about the Eurozone have undermined the single
European currency, but the dollar pared gains against the euro
following the larger-than-expected rise in the U.S. jobless
claims.
 Dollar-denominated commodities become more or less expensive
for non-dollar buyers depending on the relative strength of the
U.S. currency.

 * Thailand last imported palm oil in early 2008 
 * Higher food prices fuel fears of inflation across Asia	

(Recasts, adds background on Malaysia, Indonesia)	
 By Pracha Hariraksapitak	
 BANGKOK, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Thailand will import 30,000
tonnes of crude palm oil, the first in three years, because of
a domestic shortage, as other Southeast Asian countries took
action to hold down prices as inflation worries grew.	
 The phenomenon has revived memories of the jump in food
and commodity prices in 2008 that led to a panic about
supplies and sparked unrest in some countries.	
 Palm oil is widely used for cooking in Southeast Asia.
Thailand is broadly self-sufficient and last imported in early
2008.	
 ""The importing process must be completed by the end of
January,"" Apichart Jongsakul, an Agriculture Ministry official
said, adding the government wanted to make sure Thai farmers
did not suffer when domestic palm oil output rose in February.	
 He did not say where the palm oil would come from but
traders and industry officials expect it will be bought from
Malaysia because of its proximity.	
 Benchmark palm oil futures  hit a 33-month high on
Thursday, as concern grew over a squeeze in vegetable oil
supplies in Southeast Asia and soyoil-exporting South America.	
 Costlier cooking oil can fuel general food-related
inflation and possibly increase subsidy spending for
governments that are trying to rein in their budget deficits
and sustain the region's strong revival from the global
financial crisis. [ID:nL3E7C6080]	
 
 SUBSIDIES, HOARDING 
 Top palm oil producer Indonesia said on Wednesday it would
continue to subsidise the 10 percent value added tax imposed
on cooking oil to hold down inflation.	
 The government will spend 280 billion rupiah ($31
million) this year on the subsidy and is likely to keep
raising export taxes to ensure ample supplies for the domestic
market even though production is expected to rise in 2011.	
 Malaysia's government spent 1.7 billion ringgit ($553
million) on cooking oil subsidies last year and officials say
the bill may rise this year if palm oil prices climb.	
 In a bid to counter hoarding and tight supplies, Malaysia,
the world's second-biggest palm oil producer, has ordered
firms to boost subsidised cooking oil supplies by 20 percent
to 84,000 tonnes in January, local media reported.	
 ""This move has more to do with the Chinese New Year coming
up. The festive season always causes some sort of hoarding,""
said a government official, referring to the holiday on Feb. 3
and 4.	
 In Thailand, consumers have complained that one-litre
bottles of cooking oil became scarce in supermarkets from late
December. Demand is traditionally high at the end of the year
ahead of holidays and supply is low because of the dry season.	
 The Commerce Ministry has blamed traders for the shortage,
saying crude palm oil was being hoarded by profiteers who
expected to make a killing from a rise in prices.	
 Thailand did not need to import any palm oil last year or
in 2009. The government said in 2008 it would import 30,000
tonnes from Malaysia, at a time when the whole of Asia was
worried about food security. In the end, it only shipped in
14,000 tonnes around January-February that year from a private
Malaysian trader.	
 Firms making cooking oil from palm have asked the Commerce
Ministry for permission to raise retail prices of one-litre
bottles by around 10 baht from the current 38 baht ($1.26).
The ministry fixes the retail price.	
 ""The Commerce Minister will meet with producers on Friday
to decide how much retail prices should be raised,"" said an
official at the ministry's Department of Internal Trade.	
 Food prices account for 37 percent of the basket of goods
and services used for Thailand's retail price index. Inflation
in 2010 averaged 3.3 percent and the Commerce Ministry has
forecast 3.2 to 3.7 percent for 2011. [ID:nSGE70302G]

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Developed market stocks climbed on
Thursday on hopes for renewed U.S. economic growth, while
emerging markets slipped on concerns about food prices.
 Wall Street looked set to open higher and the dollar gained.
 The key driver was Wednesday's ADP Employer Services report
on Wednesday showing U.S. private employers added 297,000 jobs
in December, a figure that was nearly three times what
economists had forecast and the biggest jump on record for ADP,
which has data going back to 2000.
 Jobs are often a lagging indicator of economic health and an
improvement can show that recovery is becoming more sustainable.
The ADP numbers raised expectations for Friday's non-farm
payrolls figures -- traditionally the month's major release.
 ""The data that we have seen up to November has been pretty
solid but one thing that has been lagging is the employment
market in the U.S. and there is a feeling that to really
underpin the recovery, the job market needs to turnaround,"" said
Giles Watts, head of equities at City Index.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were up 0.3
percent, mainly on the back of gains in Japan and Europe.
Emerging markets stocks <.MSCIEF> were down 0.2 percent.
 Food prices rose to a record high last month, the United
Nations' food agency said this week. Emerging markets are
traditionally more susceptible to food price inflation.
 Developed markets were bullish. The pan-European
FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was up 0.9 percent for a more than 2.7
percent rise in the very short year-to-date.
 Euro zone economic sentiment jumped in December, mainly
thanks to a sharp increase in optimism in industry and the
retail sector, but inflation expectations also surged.
 Japan's Nikkei <.N22%> stormed to an eight-month closing
high, up 1.4 percent for a nearly 3 percent gain in three
sessions.
 DOLLAR STEADY
 The dollar was higher, following a surge in the previous
session.
 ""The market expects a significantly strong figure for
Friday's payrolls, but they could be overestimating. So there is
scope for disappointment,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist
at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value
against a basket of major currencies, was 0.2 percent higher at
80.42 <.DXY>, a sharp turnaround from last week's 78.775 trough.
 But investors were reluctant to chase the dollar much higher
ahead of Friday's payrolls numbers.
 The euro eased 0.3 percent to $1.3100 .
 Currency markets digested moves by Brazil's central bank to
curb speculation by imposing a reserve requirement on banks'
short dollar positions. The local real, which has risen sharply
along with many emerging market currencies, fell on the news.
 Core euro zone government debt was flat.
 Spanish newspaper El Pais reported that China's Vice Premier
Li Keqiang signalled at a meeting during a visit to Madrid that
his country is willing to buy about 6 billion euros of Spanish
public debt.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The dollar steadied on Thursday
after a surge in the previous session, with investors reluctant
to chase the currency higher ahead of Friday's non-farm payroll
numbers.
 A string of robust U.S. data have driven the dollar higher
on expectations that the world's largest economy would recovery
faster than other major economies.
 The ADP jobs report on Wednesday showed a record 297,000
private-sector jobs were created in December and U.S. factory
and services sectors' data this week also buoyed the greenback. 
 ""There have been positive developments for the U.S. economy
pointing to a more sustained recovery, whereas investors remain
concerned about developments in the UK and Europe,"" said Lee
Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 ""The market expects a significantly strong figure for
Friday's payrolls, but they could be overestimating. So there is
scope for disappointment,"" he added.
 The ADP report drove a 1.5 percent gain against the yen for
the dollar, its biggest one-day rise in more than three months,
although dollar-selling by Japanese exporters tempered gains. By
0817 GMT, it was down 0.2 percent on the day at 83.05 yen.
 The euro eased 0.2 percent to $1.3123. Traders focused on a
digital option at $1.3125 worth some 15-20 million euros which
was set to expire at 1500 GMT, which may constrain trade.
 They also cited trendline support at $1.3110, with another
possible downside target lurking at $1.3080, the euro's 200-day
moving average.
 
 DOLLAR STRENGTH
 Payrolls on Friday are expected to show overall gains of
175,000 jobs for December -- up from 140,000 prior to the ADP
data.
 Some traders said it could be difficult for the dollar to
extend its surge if the figure came close to expectations.
 ""A number around 200,000 would likely spur profit-taking. A
positive surprise of 250,000-300,000 is needed to spur the
dollar higher,"" one London-based trader said.
 The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value
against a basket of major currencies, was steady at 80.287 , a
sharp turnaround from last week's 78.775 trough.
 ""Everybody is happy for now to hop on the bus, which seems
headed toward dollar strength,"" said Kimihiko Tomita, head of
foreign exchange at State Street Global Markets in Tokyo.
 The Australian dollar traded below parity and fell 0.1
percent to $0.9985.
 Worries about widespread floods in the Australian state of
Queensland, which produces two-fifths of the world's coking
coal, provided another excuse to take profits on the Aussie,
traders said.

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks rallied on
Thursday as investors snapped up shares of big exporters after
the dollar hit two-week highs against the yen, but markets
elsewhere in Asia were more subdued ahead of the influential
U.S. non-farm payrolls report.	
 Copper climbed 1 percent to a high of $9,654.25 a tonne
, bringing the all-time high of $9,754 struck on
Tuesday back in sight, after an ADP report on Wednesday showed
a record 297,000 U.S. private sector jobs were created in
December.	
 It was the clearest signal in months that a recovery in
the world's biggest economy was shifting up a gear and
prompted analysts to raise their forecasts for the closely
watched non-farm payrolls data due on Friday.	
 Estimates now centre on an increase of 175,000 jobs, up
from 140,000 in an earlier Reuters survey.	
 While some analysts were sceptical of the size of the jump
in the ADP job report, it does follow a string of recent
upbeat U.S. data showing the economy is picking up steam.	
 ""Markets will now wait for U.S. payrolls on Friday for
confirmation of the strong trend,"" said Hiroaki Osakabe, a
fund manager at Chibagin Asset Management in Tokyo. ""But
investors will then focus on how the U.S. data will impact the
dollar/yen rate.""	
 
 
 Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 1.4 percent and
closed above the psychologically important barrier of 10,500.
It ended at its best level since May 2010. 
 Major exporters including Canon Inc and Toyota
Motors climbed more than 1 percent.	
 MSCI's index for Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan
edged up 0.1 percent, having drifted in and
out of negative territory. 
 Earlier this week, technical indicators showed it was
close to being overbought after a strong end-2010 rally,
making investors wary that markets were due for a pullback.	
 South Korea's KOSPI fell 0.2 percent, China's
Shanghai Composite index shed 0.6 percent and Hong
Kong's Hang Seng index was flat.	
 Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index closed 0.2 percent
higher as some mining shares recovered from an earlier fall,
helping the index bounce off a one-month low.	
 Severe floods in Australia's northeast had made investors
nervous about the outlook for some company earnings.	
 
 DOLLAR FIRM	
 The floods have also raised worries about inflation,
underscored by a UN food agency report, which showed global
food prices hit a record high last month.	
 The agency said key grains could climb even further as
weather pattern give cause for concern. This could raise the
risk that countries like China and India will take further
action to tackle rising food inflation.	
 ""Clearly with inflation pressures building up ... they
will have to increase the pace of their rate hikes. Currency
appreciation will help, but it will not be enough,"" said
Eugene Kim, Hong Kong-based managing director of Tribridge
Investment Partners, which manages nearly $300 million in
Asian debt.	
 In the currency market, the dollar rose to 83.39 yen
, reaching highs not seen since Dec. 23, while the euro
traded around $1.3150 , after falling below $1.3200 for
the first time since Dec. 29.	
 The dollar index , which tracks the greenback's
performance against a basket of major currencies, was little
changed on the day at 80.238, having topped out at a fresh
one-week high of 80.353.	
 ""As long as the key jobs data on Friday is in line with
expectations, the dollar is likely keep its gains, but it
looks hard for it to climb higher as the market has already
priced in good numbers,"" said Hideki Hayashi, a global
economist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.	
 U.S. crude oil  was steady in Asia, holding just
below $90.50 a barrel, having hit a high of $90.84 on
Wednesday in the wake of the U.S. data. It was within striking
distance of a 27-month high of $92.58 set in the first trading
day of the year.

 AMSTERDAM, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Loss-making Dutch car marker
Spyker said its unit Saab sold 31,700 cars over 2010, at the low
end of its guidance, as it reported a 129 percent jump in fourth
quarter sales at its premium Swedish brand.
 Spyker, the Dutch luxury sports car maker which acquired
much larger Saab early last year, said Saab sold 11,448 cars in
the fourth quarter, up 129 percent compared with the same period
in 2009 and up 31 percent quarter-on-quarter.
 Saab sold 31,696 cars over 2010 after it had cut its
full-year sales target in October to 30,000 to 35,000 units,
from 45,000 previously, because it had to rebuild its supplier

 FACTORS TO WATCH:	
 Another hefty trade surplus would give fodder to foreign 
critics of the tightly managed yuan ahead of
President Hu Jintao's visit to the United States this month.
Beijing has vowed to cut the politically contentious trade
surplus by boosting imports.	
 China's full-year trade surplus is expected to hit $190
billion.	
 Investors will also look closely at import growth as a
gauge
of the strength of China's domestic demand, particularly as
Europe's debt worries still cast a shadow over the global
economy.	
 
 MARKET IMPACT:	
 A stronger-than-expected trade surplus would encourage
investors to buy offshore yuan non-deliverable forwards
on expectations of faster appreciation, while
faster-than-expected import growth would bolster confidence in
China's economic recovery.	
 A downside surprise in import growth would be negative for
the stock market, leading investors to worry about whether
China's domestic demand will be able to withstand more
tightening as the government battles inflation.

 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The dollar held steady against the
yen and the euro on Thursday, maintaining overnight gains, and
could strengthen more after strong private employment data lifted
expectations for Friday's U.S. payrolls number.
 The dollar took a breather against the yen after rallying 1.5
percent on Wednesday for its biggest one-day rise in more than
three months, as dollar selling by Japanese exporters tempered
the rally.
 The euro eased slightly to $1.3141, hovering near trendline
support at $1.3110, with another possible downside target lurking
at $1.3081, the euro's 200-day moving average.
 The U.S. ADP report showed a record 297,000 private-sector
jobs were created in December, reinforcing views that the country
is on a steady path to recovery and sending U.S. Treasury yields
higher across the curve, which gave a lift to the dollar.
 Adding evidence of economic recovery, a separate report
showed the U.S. services sector expanded in December.
 ""The market is still bid for dollars,"" said Akira Hoshino,
chief manager at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Tokyo.
 ""If the key jobs data shows a jobs gain of 250,000 to 300,000
and the unemployment rate drops, it would further boost yields
and support the dollar,"" Hoshino said.
 The U.S. nonfarm payrolls data due on Friday is expected to
show overall gains of 175,000 jobs for December. The forecast was
revised higher from 140,000 in the wake of the ADP data.
 JAPAN EXPORTERS
 A trader for a Japanese brokerage house said that if Friday's
jobs data shows an increase of around 300,000 jobs, that could
open the way for an eventual dollar rise to 86 to 87 yen.
 The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value
against a basket of major currencies, held steady at 80.274, a
sharp turnaround from last week's 78.775 trough.
 The dollar stood at 83.25 yen, holding steady compared with
late U.S. trade on Wednesday after pulling up from an eight-week
low of 80.93 yen hit on trading platform EBS earlier this week.
 Traders cited dollar-selling by Japanese exporters at levels
above 83.20 yen, while short-term players were said to be picking
up the greenback on dips.
 The euro, which has traded mostly between $1.30 and $1.34
since December, stayed under pressure on nagging worries about
debt problems in certain euro zone nations.
 ""There are still negative factors around for the euro but
they are probably not fresh ones that would change the currency's
trend. The market is still watching how the euro zone's debt
problems will pan out,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at
Sumitomo Trust and Banking.
 The Australian dollar traded below parity and fell 0.4
percent to $0.9958.
 In addition to the latest batch of upbeat U.S. economic data,
worries about widespread floods in the Australian state of
Queensland, which produces two-fifths of the world's coking coal,
Australia's top export, provided another excuse to take profits
on the Aussie.

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The Nikkei rallied on Thursday
as investors snapped up shares of Japanese exporters after the
dollar hit two-week highs against the yen, but markets
elsewhere in Asia were more subdued ahead of the influential
U.S. non-farm payrolls report.	
 Copper climbed 1 percent to a high of $9,654.25 a tonne
, nearing a record high of $9,754 struck on Tuesday,
after an ADP report showed a record 297,000 U.S. private
sector jobs were created in December, the clearest signal in
months that a recovery in the world's biggest economy was
shifting up a gear.	
 The figure prompted analysts to raise their forecasts for
the closely watched non-farm payrolls data, with estimates now
centring on an increase of 175,000 jobs, up from 140,000 in an
earlier Reuters survey.	
 While some analysts were sceptical of the size of the jump
in the ADP job report, it does follow a string of recent
upbeat U.S. data showing the economy is picking up steam.	
 ""Markets will now wait for U.S. payrolls on Friday for
confirmation of the strong trend,"" said Hiroaki Osakabe, a
fund manager at Chibagin Asset Management. ""But investors will
then focus on how the U.S. data will impact the dollar/yen
rate.""	


 
 Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 1.2 percent and
breached the psychologically important barrier of 10,500 to
reach its best level since May 2010. 
 Major exporters including Canon Inc and Toyota
Motors climbed more than 1 percent.	
 MSCI's Asia Pacific index excluding Japan ,
however, slipped 0.1 percent, having drifted in and out of
positive territory. Earlier this week technical indicators
showed it was close to being overbought after a strong
end-2010 rally, making investors wary that markets were due
for a pullback.	
 South Korea's KOSPI and Hong Kong's Hang Seng
index were both flat, while China's Shanghai Composite
index shed 0.7 percent.	
 Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index reversed early gains
ad slid 0.4 percent as concerns over severe floods in the
country's northeast made investors unsure of how to judge
company earnings in 2011.	
 Global miner BHP Billiton fell 0.5 percent and
Rio Tinto eased about 0.1 percent.	
 
 DOLLAR FIRM	
 The dollar rose to 83.39 yen , reaching highs not
seen since Dec. 23, while the euro wallowed below $1.3200
, having fallen below that level overnight for the first
time since Dec. 29.	
 The dollar index , which tracks the greenback's
performance against a basket of major currencies, was little
changed at 80.218, after topping out at a fresh one-week high
of 80.353.	
 ""As long as the key jobs data on Friday is in line with
expectations, the dollar is likely keep its gains, but it
looks hard for it to climb higher as the market has already
priced in good numbers,"" said Hideki Hayashi, a global
economist at Mizuho Securities.	
 U.S. crude oil  edged up 0.1 percent to $90.42
, after trading as high as $90.71, not far from a
27-month high of $92.58 set in the first trading day of the
year.

 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The dollar was steady on Thursday,
maintaining overnight gains, and could strengthen more after
strong private employment data lifted expectations for Friday's
U.S. payrolls number.
 The dollar was near a two-week high against the yen after
posting its biggest one-day gain against the Japanese currency in
more than three months. Against the euro it stayed near a
one-week peak after its highest rise in three weeks on Wednesday.
 The ADP report showed a record 297,000 private-sector jobs
were created in December, reinforcing views that the country is
on a steady path to recovery and sending U.S. Treasury yields
higher across the curve, which supported the dollar.
 After such a big rise on Wednesday, traders may square
positions on Thursday and take profits.
 ""Since gains in the dollar were huge following much
stronger-than-expected ADP numbers, the currency may face some
profit-taking in Asian trade and ahead of the key jobs data,""
said Hideki Hayashi, a global economist at Mizuho Securities.
 ""As long as the key jobs data on Friday is in line with
expectations the dollar is likely keep its gains, but it looks
hard for it to climb higher as the market has already priced in
good numbers,"" Hayashi said.
 Adding evidence on the economic recovery, a separate report
showed the U.S. services sector expanded in December.
 The U.S. nonfarm payrolls number is expected to show overall
gains of 175,000 jobs for December. The forecast was revised
higher from 140,000 in the wake of the ADP data.
 The dollar index, which measures its value against major
currencies, was steady at 80.186, a sharp turnaround from last
week's 78.775 trough.
 The dollar held steady against the yen at 83.22 yen, pulling
further away from an 8-week low of 80.93 yen hit on trading
platform EBS early this week.
 The euro stayed under pressure on nagging worries about debt
roblems in some euro zone nations. The European currency was
little changed at $1.3151, with an options barrier reportedly at
$1.3125 and trend line support at $1.3110.
 The Australian dollar traded below parity at around US$0.9993
after hitting a two-week low of $0.9950 on Wednesday, well off a
28-year peak of $1.0325 hit last week.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rallied on
Wednesday and analysts expect it to gain further against other
currencies after bullish U.S. data indicated the world's
largest economy was on a steady path to recovery.
 The greenback was on pace for its biggest one-day gain
against the yen in more than three months. Against the euro the
dollar's rise was heading for the highest in three weeks. The
U.S. data and worries about the ability of some euro zone
countries to sell an abundance of debt favored the greenback
this week.
 The ADP Employer Services report, which showed U.S. private
employers added 297,000 jobs in December, further propelled an
already rising dollar. The ADP number was the largest increase
on record, with data going back to 2000, and far exceeded
market expectations for a gain of 100,000.
 The pace of private sector jobs growth is key to Federal
Reserve monetary policy.
 The data raised the stakes for Friday's key U.S. payrolls
report, according to Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency
Strategy at Wells Fargo in New York.
""Clearly the U.S. non-farm payrolls report is now shaping up
as an even more critical event. If that report confirms jobs
strength, U.S. yields and the U.S. dollar could remain higher
over the near term,"" he wrote.
 In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar index, which
measures the greenback's value against six other major
currencies, was up 1.00 percent at 80.237. The dollar surged
1.5 percent against the yen to 83.29 yen.
 The euro fell 1.2 percent to $1.3151 after earlier touching
$1.3125. Traders were focused on taking out an exotic option at
that level, which will expire at 10 a.m. New York time on
Thursday (1500 GMT). At the same time, there was buying to keep
the euro from falling below $1.3125.
 Meanwhile, the dollar's 1.9 percent gain against the Swiss
franc was the largest one day advance since June 24, 2009.
 ""There is a large appetite for the dollar as it is being
viewed as the growth currency of choice,"" said Andrew
Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers in
Greenwich, Connecticut.
 Wilkinson said he expects the euro to fall below $1.30 by
the end of the month.
 ""While core European countries are showing solid growth,
there is a lot of baggage attached to that growth and it has
the potential to explode on sovereign debt woes,"" he said. ""The
rise in Treasury yields, meanwhile, should prove to be a tail
wind for the dollar.""
 U.S. Treasuries' prices plunged. Rising yields tend to
support the dollar as they reflect stronger growth. They also
enhance the attractiveness of some dollar-denominated assets to
investors.
 A separate report showing the U.S services sector expanded
as well in December also lifted the dollar.
 ""If, in fact, employment is kicking in, then that would set
the tone for self-sustained growth, underpin interest rates and
very much underpin the dollar,"" said Bob Sinche, global head of
FX strategy at RBS Global Banking and Markets in Stamford,
Connecticut.
 Analysts said the private sector employment report bodes
well for Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls number, which is
expected to show gains of 175,000 overall jobs last month.
 ""We're definitely back to a 'buy dollar' mentality and the
market is looking to take out key support levels for the euro,""
said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at OANDA in
Toronto.
 One of those support levels is the 200-day moving average
just below $1.31, which has staunchly supported the euro over
the last two weeks and its breach could signal further
selling.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar jumped and
crude oil prices rebounded on Wednesday after surprisingly
strong data on private-sector jobs added to growing evidence
the U.S. economy is on the path to recovery.
 Wall Street's early losses turned to gains and global
equities pared most of their losses after ADP Employer Services
reported that private-sector employers created nearly triple
the number of jobs in December as markets had expected.
 The dollar was on pace for its best one-day gain in more
than three months against the Japanese yen, and oil prices
rebounded on the news that U.S. private employers added 297,000
jobs in December.
 The strong dollar initially pressured commodity prices,
with copper prices tumbling from a record high on Tuesday and
gold down in its biggest three-day slide since mid-November.
 But oil prices later turned positive and copper pared most
losses as the strong dollar, which had earlier dragged down
crude oil further from 27-month highs, eased a bit.
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY> gained about 1 percent.
 Stocks in Tokyo were poised to open higher, with the March
futures contract that trades in Chicago for the Nikkei 225
<0#NK:> up 110 points at 10,540.
 The unexpectedly large jump in U.S. private-sector jobs
drove down prices of U.S. Treasury securities as optimism over
the economy fed a bid for riskier assets. For details see:

 Investors now await U.S. nonfarm payrolls data for December
that is due on Friday for further signs the U.S. economy is
recovering more quickly than expected. [ID:nN05284674]
 ""Today's all about data reaction; you had a blowout ADP
report,"" said Michael Cloherty, head of rates strategy at RBC
Capital Markets in New York. ""In general expectations have
changed significantly for Friday's number.""
 A report from the Institute for Supply Management, an
industry group, that its gauge of the massive U.S. services
sector reached its highest level in over four years also helped
U.S. stocks to rebound and global equities to trim losses.
 ISM said its index of U.S. services sector activity rose to
57.1 in December, up from expectations of 55.6.
 Financials led gains on Wall Street, helped by credit-card
companies such as Capital One Finance Corp , whose
shares rose 4.2 percent, and extended an equities rally in
December that had sparked worries of having come too far, too
fast.
 The S&P consumer finance index <.GSPCFI>, which includes
major personal finance companies, gained 2. percent.
 ""The economy is clearly accelerating,"" said Edward
Hemmelgarn, president of Shaker Investments in Cleveland. ""It's
difficult to make the case for the market to go down in the
first six months of the year.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 31.71
points, or 0.27 percent, at 11,722.89. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> added 6.36 points, or 0.50 percent, at
1,276.56. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> gained 20.95

 The euro  slipped 1.12 percent to $1.3152 and against
the yen, the dollar  rose 1.50 percent to 83.26
 Upbeat U.S. economic data and worries about the ability of
certain euro zone countries to sell an abundance of debt has
helped make the week so far a banner one for the dollar, and
could lead it to outperform other major currencies.
 ""There is a large appetite for the dollar as it is being
viewed as the growth currency of choice,"" said Andrew
Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers in
Greenwich, Connecticut.
 Treasuries prices fell on the strong data and some analysts
see prices falling further as a brighter economic outlook dims
the attraction of government debt, a traditional safe haven
investment. [ID:nN05285548]
 Treasury debt prices also took another leg down after the
Federal Reserve bought the minimum $1.5 billion of its planned
bond purchases for Wednesday. [ID:nN20EDTABL]
 Analysts said speculation that the Fed could curtail its
$600 billion bond-buying program is likely unfounded after
minutes released on Tuesday showed the U.S. central bank sees a
""high bar"" for stopping its second quantitative easing program.
[ID:nN04233074]
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 33/32 in price to yield 3.47 percent.
 Gold fell as the dollar surged and the strong jobs data
dented safe-haven buying. But bullion ended off its lows as
commodities rebounded on an improving economic outlook.

February delivery  settled up $1.97 at $95.50.
 Brent's premium to the U.S. benchmark West Texas
Intermediate surged above $5 a barrel, the highest in seven
months.
 European shares closed flat on Wednesday as the large
increase in U.S. job creation was countered by the stronger
dollar, which helped weaken metals prices and halt a rally in
the mining sector.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares rose 0.04 percent to close at 1,142.46 points, with the
U.S. jobs data helping it climb off a day's low of 1,128.49.

 TORONTO, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar recovered
from session lows against the greenback on Wednesday to end
above parity for a third straight session, buoyed by U.S. data
that showed a much better than expected gain in private sector
jobs for December.
 The Canadian dollar  finished at C$0.9964 to the
U.S. dollar, or $1.0036, up from Tuesday's close at C$0.9985 to
the U.S. dollar, or $1.0015.
 ""We've managed to keep that level above parity for now.
We'll see what Friday brings. There's a lot of intrigue and

for the time being, people seem to be embracing risk,"" said
Eric Lascelles, chief Canada macro strategist, at TD
Securities.
 ""Not every risk-on currency had a banner day, but the
Canadian dollar managed to eke one out.""
 It clawed back above par from a session low of C$1.0024 to
the U.S. dollar, or 99.76 U.S. cents, following an ADP Employer
Services report that showed U.S. private employers added
297,000 jobs in December, nearly triple forecasts.
[ID:nN05266445]
 ""The perception is that the headwinds in the Canadian
economy are not really domestic but primarily U.S.,"" said Firas
Askari, head of foreign exchange trading at BMO Capital
Markets, noting that the Canadian dollar was outperforming
other major currencies.
 ""This is potentially a beginning of a trend of a pickup in
employment growth, which leads to housing and everything else,
which leads to us exporting more of our great commodities.
That's the logic.""
 The currency moved higher throughout the session to touch a
session high of C$0.9934 to the U.S. dollar, or $1.0066, as the
ADP figures boded well for the official U.S. jobs report on
Friday. Official monthly employment reports are also due from
Canada.
 As well, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's
congressional testimony on Friday will be closely followed.
[ID:nN31145126] 
 According to a monthly Reuters foreign exchange poll, the
currency is expected to remain fairly steady near par with the
U.S. dollar for much of this year as contradicting forces at
home and abroad push and pull.
 The survey found 76 percent of market watchers expect the
currency will stay at par or firmer over the next 12 months,
although it is forecast to end the year softer than 2010.

 BONDS SINK AS OPTIMISM RISES
 Prices for Canadian government bonds retreated after the
U.S. data, tracking U.S. Treasuries lower.
 The U.S. economic outlook improved further with the private
payrolls figures after recent strength in trade and retail
sales, prompting investors to seek riskier positions in assets
such as equities rather than the relative safety of government
bonds.
 ""The strength of U.S. economic numbers has everyone feeling
very optimistic. There's a pretty powerful risk-on trade and
the bond market, in particular, is selling off,"" said
Lascelles.
 The two-year bond  fell 8 Canadian cents to yield
1.763 percent, while the 10-year bond  shed C$1.20
to yield 3.282 percent. Canadian government bonds put in a
mixed performance against their U.S. counterparts.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The dollar leaped higher on
Wednesday and could continue to outperform other major
currencies after a slew of optimistic U.S. data indicated that
the world's largest economy was on a steady path to recovery.
 The greenback was on pace for its biggest one-day gain
against the yen in more than three months and more than two
weeks against the euro.
 The ADP Employer Services report, which showed U.S. private
employers added 297,000 jobs in December, further propelled an
already rising dollar. The ADP number was the largest increase
on record, with data going back to 2000, and far exceeded
market expectations for a gain of 100,000.
 It has so far been a banner week for the dollar as upbeat
U.S. economic data and worries about the ability of certain
euro zone countries to sell an abundance of debt worked in
favor of the greenback.
 ""There is a large appetite for the dollar as it is being
viewed as the growth currency of choice,"" said Andrew
Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers in
Greenwich, Connecticut.
 In early afternoon New York trading, the dollar index,
which measures the greenback's value against six other major
currencies, was up 0.93 percent at 80.180 <.DXY>. The dollar
surged 1.4 percent against the yen to 83.21 yen .
 The euro fell 1.1 percent to $1.3157 , touching
the barrier at $1.3125 with a reportedly $15-$20 million
payout. Traders said the seller of the option, who is on the
hook for the payout, has bought a substantial amount of euros
to try to keep it above $1.3125.
 Traders are now focused on taking out an exotic option
barrier at $1.3125 in euro/dollar, a bet that the euro zone
single currency will not fall below that level by 10 a.m. EST
(1500 GMT) on Thursday. Consequently, there has been some
buying of the euro in efforts to defend that number.
 Wilkinson said he expects the euro to fall below $1.30 by
the end of the month.
 ""While core European countries are showing solid growth,
there is a lot of baggage attached to that growth and it has
the potential to explode on sovereign debt woes,"" he said. ""The
rise in Treasury yields, meanwhile, should prove to be a tail
wind for the dollar.""
 U.S. Treasuries' prices plunged. For details, see
[ID:nN05275418]
 Rising yields tend to support the dollar as they reflect
stronger growth. They also enhance the attractiveness of some
dollar-denominated assets to investors.
 A separate report showing the U.S services sector expanded
as well in December also lifted the dollar.

 ""If, in fact, employment is kicking in, then that would set
the tone for self-sustained growth, underpin interest rates,
and very much underpin the dollar,"" said Bob Sinche, global
head of FX strategy at RBS Global Banking and Markets in
Stamford, Connecticut.
 Analysts said the private sector employment report bodes
well for Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls number, which is
expected to show gains of 175,000 overall jobs -- and 180,000
private-sector jobs -- last month. [ID:nN05280692]
 Earlier this week U.S. factory orders, construction
spending and a manufacturing index showed stronger readings as
well.
 As a result, Sinche said, RBS is ""pretty constructive on
the dollar this year."" He expects the euro to fall into the low
$1.20s against the dollar by mid-year, while dollar/yen could
rise above 85.
 ""We're definitely back to a 'buy dollar' mentality and the
market is looking to take out key support levels for the euro,""
said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at OANDA in
Toronto.
 One of those support levels is the 200-day moving average
just below $1.31, which has staunchly supported the euro over
the last two weeks and its breach could signal further
selling.
 Portugal, another debt-laden euro zone country, has come
under increasing pressure from international debt markets on
concerns it may be forced to follow Greece and Ireland and seek
a bailout. Demand for Portuguese Treasury bills was solid on
Wednesday but yields continued to rise. [ID:nLDE7040XG]
 Market focus was shifting to Spanish debt issuance for
2011, the first tranche of which comes up for auction next
week.

800,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2011 02:08PM ET</span>",IMF staff wants rules of the road on capital flows," WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The International Monetary
Fund could take a bigger role in developing ""rules of the road""
for international capital flows to ensure hot money doesn't
spread financial crises, IMF staff said on Wednesday.
 These investment flows can help poorer countries develop
and grow, but they have been blamed for overheating economies
and driving up inflation. They can also become a destabilizing
force when investors suddenly withdraw money.
 Over the past year, fast-growing emerging markets such as
Brazil have been the biggest recipients of these capital flows,
and some nations have taken steps, such as raising taxes, to
try to manage the influx. For details see [ID:nSGE69503F].
 The IMF has said adopting measures to try to control the
flow of capital is warranted in some situations, but it has not
spelled out a coherent set of principles.
 ""In the aftermath of the global crisis, and especially now
with resurgent capital flows requiring a considered policy
response, it is not tenable for the Fund to remain on the
sidelines of a debate so central to global economic stability,""
IMF staff said in a 52-page policy paper.
 These capital flows have become a hot-button issues at
international forums including the Group of 20. At the most
recent leaders summit in Seoul in November, the G20 said
emerging economies were justified in taking ""carefully
designed"" measures to counter inflows.
 Several countries have criticized the U.S. Federal Reserve
for its ultra-loose monetary policy, warning that the easy
money intended to boost the U.S. economy may instead find its
way into emerging markets.
 IMF 'HAMSTRUNG'
 The IMF staff said the Fund had been ""hamstrung"" in its
efforts to forge rules of the road for capital flows, in part
because its own membership disagrees on what those rules should
be. They said the IMF's executive board had not had a
broad-ranging discussion of capital controls since 1997.
 Since then, these so-called ""hot money"" flows have grown
dramatically and played a role in exacerbating financial
crises, including the latest one which triggered the worst
global recession since World War Two.
 As a first step, the staff said the executive board could
""articulate its views on responding to capital surges and
reversals -- in what circumstances, through what kind of
instruments, and over what time horizons.""
 From there, the board could consider endorsing principles.
The staff acknowledged that reaching agreement on such
principles would be difficult, but they said remaining silent
on the matter would be costly.
 Longer term, the staff said the IMF might consider amending
its Articles of Agreement to give it a clearer mandate to
address issues related to capital flows.
 In a separate statement, the executive board agreed on the
need to strengthen the Fund's role regarding capital flows, but
directors did not endorse all of the staff's recommendations.
 ""Directors expressed a wide range of views regarding
amendment of the Articles of Agreement to provide a more
complete and consistent legal framework for addressing issues
related to capital flows,"" they wrote.
 ""While a number of directors were open to considering an
amendment of the Articles in the future, most felt that it
would be premature to initiate a discussion on this step
without further analysis and practical experience.""

 WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama
will press China on its currency policy during his upcoming
meetings in Washington with Chinese President Hu Jintao, the
White House said on Wednesday.
 ""China plays an enormously important role in our global
economy and China has to take steps to rebalance its currency,
and the president will continue to make that point when
President Hu is here,"" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told
a news briefing.
 Hu visits the White House on Jan. 19.
 Economic issues are the single biggest source of tension
between the world's two largest economies.
 Facing a trade deficit with China up 20 percent in the
first 10 months of 2010, Washington complains that Beijing
keeps its yuan currency too low, giving it an unfair
advantage, and Obama has repeatedly warned China against
relying too much on exports for growth.
 Chinese officials say U.S. easy-money policy is aimed at
weakening the dollar to boost exports, and have said yuan
appreciation would have little impact on reducing the trade
surplus, which is expected to hit $270 billion for 2010.
 Some members of the U.S. Senate have even pushed for a law
to punish Beijing if it does not revalue the yuan.
 Human rights, the global economy, the Chinese currency and
the situation in North Korea are among items on the list of
issues the two leaders will discuss, Gibbs said.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar jumped and
global equities pared losses on Wednesday after surprisingly
strong data on private sector jobs added to growing evidence
the U.S. economy is fully on the path to recovery.
 The dollar was on pace for its best one-day gain in more
than three months against the Japanese yen and in more than two
weeks against the euro after a report that U.S. private
employers added 297,000 jobs in December, nearly triple
analysts' forecasts.
 The strong dollar pressured commodity prices, with copper
prices tumbling from a record hit on Tuesday and gold down in
its biggest three-day slide since mid-November.
 But copper and oil prices later turned positive as the
strong dollar, which had earlier pulled down crude oil further
from 27-month highs, eased a bit.
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY> had gained more than 1 percent
before paring gains to trade up 0.86 percent.
 The unexpectedly large monthly jump in U.S. private sector
jobs reported by ADP Employer Services drove down prices of
German bunds and U.S. Treasury securities as optimism over the
economy fed a bid for riskier assets. For details see:
[ID:nN05264002]
 A later report from the Institute for Supply Management, an
industry group, that its gauge of the massive U.S. services
sector reached its highest level in over four years sparked a
rebound in major U.S. stock indexes and caused global equities
to trim losses. ISM said its index of U.S. services sector
activity rose to 57.1 in December, up from expectations of
55.6.
 ""It really flows into this narrative that we're seeing
improvements across all sectors of the U.S. economy,"" Greg
Salvaggio, vice president of trading at Tempus Consulting in
Washington, said about the ISM report.
 ""And really the ADP jobs report this morning reinforces the
view that companies are beginning to hire again,"" he said.
 World stocks, as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS>, slid
about 0.3 percent, paring earlier losses by about half, and
were within a few points of highs last seen in September 2008.
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
up 37.73 points, or 0.32 percent, at 11,728.91. The Standard &

1,275.35. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 14.83

 Financials, which underperformed the broader market last
year, led gains among U.S. stocks, with the S&P financial index
<.GSPF> up 0.9 percent, while the Nasdaq led gains among the
three major stock indexes. [ID:nN05293022]
 European shares eked out a small gain on the strong U.S.
data even as the stronger dollar helped to weaken metals prices
and halt a rally for miners. [ID:nLDE7041L2]
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares rose 0.04 percent to close at 1,142.46 points.
 Analysts said the ADP survey bodes well for the U.S. Labor
Department report Friday due on data for December nonfarm
payrolls, a widely watched piece of economic data.
 Some economists revised upward their forecast for Friday's
data, which is expected to show gains of 140,000 overall jobs,
after the ADP number.
 The euro  slid 0.9 percent at $1.3178. Against the
yen, the dollar  rose 1.40 percent at 83.18 yen.
 The strong U.S. economic reports lifted sentiment in
commodity markets.
 ""As equities rallied, the oil bulls that were on the
sidelines came back and prices are bouncing back solidly. We're
in a range between $88 and $92, and people will now be awaiting

McGillian, of Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  rose $1.04 to $90.42 a

 * Republican rise weakens push for U.S. bill on China yuan
 * U.S. budget cutting could help close Doha trade talks
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - After years of trade policy
stalemate, there could be big strides in 2011 with approval of
U.S. trade deals with South Korea, Panama and Colombia,
Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization and perhaps
even the end of the longest-ever round of global trade talks.
 The Republican takeover of the House of Representatives, a
sluggish U.S. economic recovery and President Barack Obama's
goal of doubling exports could combine to spur action on
several fronts, analysts say.
 ""It might be a very big year,"" said Ed Gresser, president
of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council.
 Government data shows U.S. exports likely grew about 17
percent last year, one of the fastest rates ever as world trade
bounced back from a historic slump brought about by the
financial crisis.
 But Obama needs exports to grow about 15 percent annually
during the next four years to double them, which will be
difficult without new market-opening agreements, Gresser said.
 With U.S. consumers rebuilding battered balance sheets, the
economy will need to lean more heavily on the export sector.
Stronger U.S. export growth in turn would help bring about a
more-balanced pattern of global trade.
 The White House took a big step toward winning
congressional approval of the South Korea pact in December by
renegotiating auto provisions to win the support of the United
Auto Workers and Ford Motor Co.
 Many Democrats still oppose the deal and are even more
steadfast in opposition to the Colombia agreement but newly
empowered Republicans are eager to pass all three trade deals.
 ""The unknown is to what extent the Republican leadership
will demand to vote on all three"" if Obama balks at submitting
one or both of the Latin American pacts, said Dan Griswold,
director of the Cato Institute's trade policy section.
 Both Gresser and Griswold said they believed there would be
votes to pass all of them if Obama made a big push.
 DOHA ROUND, RUSSIA WTO
 The three FTA countries will be listening for a clear
signal from Obama in his State of the Union speech on Jan. 25,
and so will negotiators in Geneva trying to finish the
9-year-old Doha round of world trade talks.
 Those negotiations aimed at opening agriculture,
manufacturing and services markets around the world have
recently shown renewed signs of life.
 But to convince the other 152 members the United States is
serious about a deal, ""Obama is going to have to take on the
farm lobby the way he hasn't done before,"" Griswold said.
 The United States has been pushing big developing countries
like China, India and Brazil to make better offers in the
negotiations to open their markets, while fending off pressure
for deeper cuts in U.S. farm subsidies.
 The huge U.S. budget deficit could change that dynamic and
help Obama strike a deal since it will be harder for U.S.
farmers to resist spending cuts when programs from Medicare to
defense are facing the ax, Gresser said.
 If nations agree to bigger tariff cuts and significantly
greater market openings than now on the table, the deal could
lift global growth by as much as $283 billion a year, according
to the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
 Even if a Doha round is not finished, there is a good
chance Russia's nearly 19-year-old bid to join the WTO could
conclude in 2011, bringing the largest economy outside the WTO
into the rules-based trading system.
 To accomplish that, Obama needs to persuade Russia to
address U.S. concerns in areas ranging from meat trade to
intellectual property rights enforcement.
 He also will have to convince Congress to grant ""permanent
normal trade relations"" to Russia by finally removing a Cold
War restriction known as the Jackson-Vanik amendment.
 That measure used the threat of higher U.S. tariffs on
imports from centrally planned economies to promote the rights
of Jews and other religious minorities to emigrate freely.
 CHINA, APEC
 Meanwhile, concerns in Congress about China's trade and
currency practices remain strong as U.S. lawmakers accuse
Beijing of deliberately undervaluing its currency to give
Chinese companies a trade advantage. The yuan's value is
certain to be a topic when Obama meets with Chinese President
Hu Jintao in Washington later this month.
 But efforts in Congress to get tough with China over its
currency policies may have ""hit the high-water mark"" in 2010,
when the Senate killed a bill that would have ramped up
pressure on China to let its currency rise, Griswold said.
 Supporters have vowed to try again but will face a tougher
environment with Republicans controlling the House.
 As the host this year of the 21-member economy Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum, the United States has an
opportunity to advance open trade among countries that already
account for about 60 percent of world economic growth.
 When Obama, Hu and other APEC leaders gather in Honolulu in
November for their annual summit, one major development could
be the announcement that the United States has struck a deal
with eight APEC members -- Vietnam, Malaysia, New Zealand,
Australia, Chile, Peru, Singapore and Brunei -- on terms of the
Trans-Pacific Partnership pact.
 If a deal is reached, it could become a ""pathway"" agreement
for an even bigger pact covering all 21 APEC members.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The dollar jumped on Wednesday
and may likely extend gains over the next few weeks after
strong U.S. private-sector jobs data reinforced expectations of
a self-sustaining recovery in the world's largest economy.
 The greenback was on pace for its best one-day gain in more
than three months against the yen and more than two weeks
against the euro.
 The ADP Employer Services report, which showed U.S. private
employers added 297,000 jobs in December, further propelled an
already rising dollar. The ADP number was the largest increase
on record, with data going back to 2000, and exceeded market
expectations for employment gains of 100,000.
 ""If, in fact, employment is kicking in, then that would set
the tone for self-sustained growth, underpin interest rates,
and very much underpin the dollar,"" said Bob Sinche, head of FX
strategy at RBS Global Banking and Markets.
 Analysts said the private sector employment survey bodes
well for Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls number, which is
expected to show gains of 140,000 overall jobs -- and 145,000
private-sector jobs -- last month.
 The ADP jobs data followed a series of upbeat U.S. economic
reports this week suggesting the U.S. recovery seemed genuine
and not merely because of short-term government stimulus
measures. Earlier this week U.S. factory orders, construction
spending and a manufacturing index showed stronger readings as
well.
 As a result, Sinche said, RBS is ""pretty constructive on
the dollar this year."" He expects the euro to fall into the low
$1.20s against the dollar by mid-year, while dollar/yen could
rise above 85.
 In early New York trading, the dollar index, which measures
the greenback's value against six major currencies, was up 1.0
percent at 80.245. The dollar surged 1.3 percent against the
yen to 83.13 yen.
 The euro fell 1.2 percent to $1.3141, within striking
distance of a key 200-day moving average just below $1.31. This
level has staunchly supported the euro over the last two weeks
and its breach could signal further selling.
 The next big level to watch is $1.3125.
 The Swiss National Bank stopped accepting Irish government
bonds as collateral in its money market operations, a move that
also dented sentiment toward the euro.
 Portugal, another debt-laden euro zone country, has come
under increasing pressure from international debt markets on
concerns it may be forced to follow Greece and Ireland and seek
a bailout. Demand for its Portuguese Treasury bills was solid
on Wednesday, but yields continued rise.
 Market focus was shifting to Spanish debt issuance for
2011, the first tranche of which comes up for auction next
week.
 ""It's not out of the question that speculators could target
Spain in the same way they targeted Ireland,"" said Stephen
Gallo, head of Market Analysis at Schneider Foreign Exchange.

 By Herbert Lash and Jeremy Gaunt
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - World stocks, crude oil
and the euro retreated from early new year highs on Wednesday,
with underlying economic optimism reined in by jitters about
lingering debt woes and uncertainty about economic data.
 In a pattern investors say may well be repeated throughout
2011, a burst of new year investor optimism in stocks quickly
fell prey to profit taking and so-called correlation trading
that links moves in one security to the buying or selling of
another.
 A slide in commodity prices continued for a second day,
pressuring world equity markets. The fall in commodity prices
may have resulted from the rise in the U.S. dollar and a fall
in the Australian dollar after severe floods in that
country.
 Oil, which had only a few days ago looked to be heading to
$100 a barrel again, fell back below $89 a barrel in London.
[O/R]. Prices of both commodities and equities, however,
remained near multi-year highs.
 The biggest increase in U.S. private sector jobs since at
least 2001, as reported by ADP Employer Services, supported the
new year optimism, leading bond prices to decline and many
stock markets to trim losses. For details see: [ID:nN05266445]
 ""You cannot ignore the strength of this report. As a
consequence of this report we are taking our payrolls estimate
higher for sure,"" said Tom Porcelli, U.S. economist at RBC
Capital Markets in New York.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 27.17
points, or 0.23 percent, at 11,664.01. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was down 3.56 points, or 0.28 percent, at
1,266.64. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 7.08
points, or 0.26 percent, at 2,674.17.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> remained
down 0.6 percent, about the same as before the ADP report and
still within a few points of highs last seen in the third
quarter of 2008.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> pared losses and was
down 0.5 percent. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed down
nearly 0.2 percent after hitting a 7-1/2 month closing high on
Tuesday.
 A number of market moves were put down to investors
adjusting positions after end-of-year balancing of portfolios.
 Investors were also awaiting U.S. jobs data due on Friday
for confirmation that the world's largest economy is
recovering, a key factor in recent equity rallies.
 ""Growth in the labor market one of the biggest deciding
factors for markets this year, that is why we are seeing
investors a bit cautious ahead of the (jobs) numbers. If the
job figures are good, we could see a push higher,"" said David
Jones, market strategist at IG Index.
 U.S. private employers added 297,000 jobs in December,
triple the median estimate by economists and up from the gain
of 92,000 in November, the ADP report showed on Wednesday.
 Commodities were hit hard on Tuesday, with the
Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB> closing nearly 1.6 percent
down as energy, metals and agricultural investors took profits
on the heady gains made on thin holiday volume over the past
two weeks. [COM/WRAP]
 The sell-off continued in some areas on Wednesday. Copper
futures, for example, fell two percent in London. The
Australian dollar  was down about 0.5 percent.
 And spot gold  fell 1.0 percent to a session trough
at $1,364.90 an ounce, the lowest since Dec. 12.
 FIRMER US DOLLAR
 The U.S. dollar took some of the blame for the commodities'
slide, holding firm on hopes for U.S. economic recovery.
[FRX/]
 Market players said the dollar's rise and the partly
related drop in commodities this week have been riven by
position unwinding.
 ""The move over the past two weeks was somewhat exaggerated,
having taken place in thin liquidity. With liquidity now coming
back on stream, the markets are now reassessing some of the
moves,"" said Sue Trinh, strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value
against major currencies, rose 1 percent to 80.256 <.DXY>.
 The euro dipped 0.6 percent to $1.3145 , with traders
nervy over the higher yields paid by Portugal at its latest
Treasury bill auction on Wednesday [ID:nLDE7040XG] and reports
about European Union plans to insist in future on senior
creditors accepting writedowns on the debt of ailing EU banks.

 * Pound to make steady gains on euro
 * Cable seen at $1.58 in 12 months
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The pound will coast for six
months but end 2011 a little higher than where it started the
year as the Bank of England begins to unwind its ultra-loose
monetary policy in the second half, a Reuters poll found.
 Median forecasts from the poll of over 50 analysts, taken
over the past week saw cable at $1.55 in a month and then
nudging up to $1.58 in a year, a little weaker than in
December's poll.
 The pound was trading around $1.56 on Wednesday and is seen
at $1.55 in six months time.
 ""As the BoE will not follow the Fed in another round of
asset purchases and should gradually start hiking rates in late
2011, while the Fed will remain on hold, cable should enjoy a
sizeable rebound in H2,"" said Roberto Mialich at UniCredit.
 Mialich was the second most accurate forecaster in Reuters
FX polls last year, having topped the league in 2008.
 A Reuters poll published last month predicted the BoE would
begin raising rates from October whereas the U.S. Federal
Reserve, which has bought trillions of dollars worth of bonds to
bolster the world's biggest economy, will be more cautious.
 But 12-month forecasts were fairly wide, ranging from $1.36
to $1.83, suggesting uncertainty remains and the pound slipped
to a three-month low late last month after a downward revision
in UK economic growth reminded investors the country's recovery
remains fragile.
 The Office for National Statistics Office revised down third
quarter growth to 0.7 percent from 0.8 percent and said growth
in the first two quarters of the year was also slightly weaker
than previously reported.
 A Reuters poll taken last month suggests growth will slow
further, averaging between 0.3 and 0.5 percent per quarter
through this year.
 ""The underlying dynamics of the UK economy remain deeply
worrying,"" said Dorothea Huttanus, Head of Foreign Exchange and
Money Markets at DZ Bank and the most accurate forecaster across
last year's polls.
 ""Given that the coming 3-6 months are likely to bring a
considerable amount of negative headlines from the UK, expect
sterling to continue weaker from here onwards.""
 
 EURO POUNDING
 Against the euro the pound was expected to gain strength as
the common currency faces its own headwinds.
 The euro was seen worth 85.0 pence in a month, 83.3p in six
and 82.5p in a year, compared to respective 84.2p, 84.4p and
83.0p forecasts in last month's poll.
 The bloc, which expanded to 17 members when Estonia joined
on Jan. 1, has struggled to escape from its deepest post-war
recession and concerns about the fiscal strength of periphery
members battered the currency in 2010.
 The European Central Bank slashed interest rates to record
lows and injected billions of euros into the money supply and is
not seen hiking rates from 1.0 percent until early next year.
 ""Over the near term EUR may gain some support from increased
support from the ECB in terms of peripheral debt purchases but
weaker and divergent growth as well as ongoing debt tensions in
the euro zone periphery point to further EUR weakness over
coming months,"" said Mitul Kotecha at Calyon.
 Sterling was seen less volatile against the dollar over the
coming month. Analysts say the divergence of forecasts in
Reuters currency polls offers a leading indicator of exchange
rate volatility in the following month.

 * Considers connecting to regional power grid link
 * Iraq sees electricity shortfall this summer
 
 By Rania El Gamal and Aseel Kami
 BAGHDAD, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Iraq has been unable, due to U.S.
sanctions, to pay Iran millions of dollars owed for electricity,
an Iraqi official said, potentially damaging its efforts to
supply enough power to a population suffering chronic shortages.
 Iraq imports 650 megawatts of electricity from Iran and
plans to boost imports to around 1,000 MW this year, Adel Mahdi,
an adviser in the electricity ministry, said on Wednesday.
 But due to U.S. sanctions against Tehran over its nuclear
programme, foreign banks have refused to transfer at least $200
million of overdue payments to Iran, raising fears among Iraqi
officials that a cheap and vital power supply could be cut ahead
of the sizzling Iraqi summer.
 ""I fear an indirect effect, that by summer maybe the debt on
us will be half a billion (dollars) and at that time they (Iran)
have peak demand... they could say 'we will have to eliminate
the contract and stop',"" Mahdi said in an interview.
 ""That would cause a very big problem to Iraq.""
 He said last year Iraq's peak power supply was about
6,500-7,000 MW, and demand was estimated at 14,000 MW during the
summer when temperatures frequently exceed 50 Celsius and air
conditioning units run constantly.
 In 2011, supply is expected to rise to around 8,000 MW as
new power plants and turbines go online.
 But demand is also expected to increase to more than 15,000
MW as the country rebuilds an economy and infrastructure damaged
by war, Mahdi said.
 ""The demand is still rising at high levels, the annual
demand growth is around 8 to 10 percent,"" he said, ""... which
means this year... the shortfall will remain at around 50
percent.""
 Additional generation would remain limited in 2012 but
people would start noticing a large increase the following year,
he said.
 Last summer, days of protests in the Shi'ite south over
crippling power cuts forced the then electricity minister to
step down. The former oil minister, Hussain al-Shahristani, is
serving as acting electricity minister.
 Seven years after the U.S.-led invasion, Iraq's national
grid still only supplies a few hours of power each day and
intermittent electricity is one of the public's top complaints.
 Struggling to meet demand, Iraq is considering connecting to
a regional power grid link, Mahdi said.
 ""There are positive indications from both the Syrian and
Egyptian sides,"" Mahdi said. ""We need negotiations with Jordan
and Syria, and to complete the required... installation of
transmission lines.""
 The regional power grid link is intended to have a capacity
to provide each member with more than 500 MW and connect Egypt,
Libya, Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, Syria, Turkey and Iraq, he
said.
 Iraq is also in talks with Syria over electricity imports
this summer through an old link, with a capacity of 70 MW, to
the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, he said.

 By Sandor Peto
 BUDAPEST, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The Polish zloty is set to lead
central European currencies higher in 2011 on the back of
economic recovery and monetary tightening, although the euro
zone debt crisis will cap their gains early in the year, a
Reuters poll forecast on Wednesday.
 The zloty is expected to firm 4.4 percent against the euro
in 2011, the Czech crown stands to appreciate 4.3 percent while
the Hungarian forint will rise 2.2 percent and the Romanian leu
1.5 percent, according to the poll of 38 analysts taken on Jan.
3-4.
 The forecasts were slightly more bullish than in a similar
poll a month ago.
 Central Europe's emerging economies have generally stronger
growth potential and higher interest rates than their richer
west European peers.
 Analysts said ample global liquidity would continue to buoy
emerging market assets, but appetite for central European
currencies would also be hampered in the next months by concerns
that some euro zone states may run into difficulty financing
their debt.
 ""The (short-term) outlook is stable as you got conflicting
factors,"" said Koon Chow of Barclays.
 ""On the one side you have euro area problems, but as a
positive factor you've got continued cyclical recovery and
(central bank interest) rate hikes in some countries -- the two
will likely balance each other out.""
 Central European countries rely heavily on exports to
western Europe and their currencies' performance was mixed last
year with fears about contagion from euro zone debt problems
weighing on sentiment.
 The region's safe haven unit, the Czech crown, outperformed,
strengthening 5.3 percent against the euro in 2010. Poland's
more resilient economy boosted the zloty by 3.8 percent, while
the forint shed 2.7 percent and the leu eased by 0.2 percent.
 The latest poll forecasts for this year were slightly more
optimistic than in a poll a month ago. The median 12-month
forecasts changed to 3.79 per euro for the zloty in the latest
poll, from 3.8 a month ago; to 24 for the crown, from 24.2; and
to 272 per euro for the forint, from 272.50.
 The leu was the exception. It now is seen at only 4.2 versus
the euro in 12 months, compared to a 4.16 in the previous poll.
 
 MONETARY TIGHTENING
 Rapid capital inflows are less of a concern in central
Europe than in other emerging markets such as Brazil as the
region's currencies are still far from record highs hit in
2007-2008 and inflation fears are expected to spur interest rate
rises.
 Hungary's central bank has already lifted its base rate
twice since late last year to 5.75 percent, partly because of
concerns that government measures to cut the budget deficit
would not be sustainable in the long term.
 Analysts said their forecasts for a firming forint assume
Budapest would announce longer-term spending cuts by February as
it has promised.
 ""Should this fail to happen, we can imagine a negative
scenario in which ratings agencies would downgrade the country
into junk category and in which the forint would weaken
significantly versus the euro,"" said CIB Bank's Gyorgy Barta.
 Polish central bank Governor Marek Belka said on Tuesday
that it was time to begin gradual monetary tightening and some
analysts forecast the bank will raise its key rate from 3.5
percent at its Jan. 18-19 meeting.
 The government is struggling to keep public debt under the
legal limit of 55 percent of gross domestic product and avoid
painful spending cuts before elections in October. But Poland's
debt is much lower and its economic growth much stronger than in
Hungary.
 ""Fiscal concerns and the euro crisis outweigh monetary
tightening and strong growth in the first half of 2011,"" said
Ralf Wiegert of IHS Global Insight. ""But the ongoing strength of
Poland's growth momentum will dominate afterwards and force the
zloty back into appreciation mode again.""
 Poland, the only European Union member to avoid recession
last year, forecasts economic growth of 3.5 percent in 2011,
higher than other countries in the region.
 In the Czech Republic, where inflation is relatively benign,
the central bank is not expected to start to raising its key
interest rate from 0.75 percent until the middle of the year.
 ""While the crown is expected to remain mostly resilient to
euro zone-related problems, the dovish stance of the local MPC
(central bank monetary policy committee) should prevent
appreciation in the first quarter of 2011,"" said Peter Poplawski
of BGZ Bank.""
 In Romania, the economy is still in recession and the
country's fragile government is carrying out budget cuts.
 The central bank is expected to keep its benchmark policy
rate at 6.25 percent in the next two months and then cut it to
5.75 percent later this year, countering the regional trend.

 LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The dollar held firm on Wednesday,
bolstered by further evidence that the U.S. economic recovery is

 A recent series of economic data has raised hopes for a

euro is range-trading. There isn't much confidence in the euro

 * International tensions, protectionism could hit growth
 * Increasingly difficult world for Western corporates
 * Cyberwarfare, corporate espionage national security issues
 
 By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent
 LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Forget the G20 as a source of
global leadership. Senior political risk analyst Ian Bremmer
says the next decade will be that of the ""G-zero"" -- an
increasingly rudderless world of growing international tension.
 When the Group of 20 emerging and developed nations began
holding summits at the height of the financial crisis in 2008,
many analysts saw it as a new global governance forum
supplanting the Western-dominated G7/G8.
 Others saw the rise of a ""G2"" relationship between China and
the United States. But Bremmer, founder and president of risk
consultancy Eurasia Group, says such talk misses the point.
 ""People keep on asking: who is going to be in charge? Is it
going to be the U.S., is it China?"" he told Reuters in a
telephone interview. ""No one is going to be in charge. That's
what makes it so dangerous.""
 Eurasia Group picked out the ""G-zero"" world as the leading
political risk to markets and corporations in 2011, followed by
continuing problems in the euro zone and the rise of cyber
security threats fuelled by growing international tension.
 Rivalries over relative currency strengths, dubbed ""currency
wars"" by some policymakers last year, were an early indicator of
this worsening environment, Bremmer said, with trade and global
growth likely to suffer as a result.
 This economic friction was also making it more difficult to
resolve trouble spots such as North Korea.
 Bremmer argues the financial crash that followed the 2008
bankruptcy of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers effectively
concealed the emergence of a ""non-polar"" world order by bringing
temporary -- and somewhat illusory -- unity at the 2009 London
G20 summit. World leaders agreed then on a broad programme to
stimulate and regulate the global economy.
 But that moment has passed. The new emerging powers -- most
importantly the BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and
China -- have less aspiration to exercise U.S.-style global
responsibility, he said.
 Meanwhile, developed powers such as the United States, Japan
and European countries are distracted by their own problems in
adjusting after the financial crisis.
 
 CHANGING NATURE OF WAR
 ""We haven't seen this kind of global environment in most
people's living memory,"" he said. ""You could say it was the case
in the first half of the 20th century -- and that was the bloody
half. I think that sense of uncertainty is one of the reasons so
much money is still being held back on the sidelines by
corporates and investors.""
 While he saw little imminent risk of armed conflict outside
the Korean peninsula, Bremmer said the nature of war appeared to
be changing, with dividing lines between economic and national
security policy breaking down.
 He argued in a book last year entitled ""The End of the Free
Market"" that the rise of state capitalist economies such as
China and Russia was a game changer for Western corporates,
putting them at a disadvantage if they did not learn to adapt.
State-backed cyber attacks and corporate espionage were
early signs of this trend, as were hints of protectionism.
 ""What you're seeing is a rolling back of globalisation,"" he
said. ""It's going to be a particularly difficult environment for
Western corporates, although there will be first mover
advantages for those that adapt. 
 ""Often, they are going to need to find more support from
governments -- maybe more than one government.""

 Market players said the dollar's rise and a drop in
commodities this week had been driven in part by position
unwinding, with investors trimming back some bets made before
year-end.
 ""The move over the past two weeks was somewhat exaggerated,
having taken place in thin liquidity. With liquidity coming back
on stream, the markets are now reassessing some of the moves,""
said Sue Trinh, strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value
against major currencies, was up 0.4 percent at 79.755. The
dollar was close to flat at 82.11 yen.
 
 EURO DIPS
 The euro dipped 0.6 percent to $1.3210 after stops were
triggered on the break of $1.3250. Traders reported demand from
major Asian sovereign accounts to buy the dip.
 ""Debt problems in the euro zone are well flagged now and the
euro is range-trading. There isn't much confidence in the euro
but clearly there are central bank buyers towards 1.30,"" said
Schmidt at Lloyds.
 The euro made a brief dip below $1.30 at the end of November
before registering a strong bounce to around $1.3500. It has
held well within that range over recent weeks.
 Traders said news the Swiss National Bank has stopped
accepting Irish government bonds as collateral in its money
market operations dented sentiment towards the euro.
 Portugal has come under increasing pressure from
international debt markets on concerns it may be forced to
follow Greece and Ireland and seek an EU/IMF bailout. Demand for
its Treasury bills was solid on Wednesday though yields
continued to rise.
 Market focus was shifting to Spanish issuance for 2011, the
first tranche of which comes up for auction next week.
 ""It's not out of the question that speculators could target
Spain in the same way they targeted Ireland,"" said Stephen
Gallo, head of Market Analysis at Schneider Foreign Exchange.
 ""I don't think ringfencing issues for Spain are priced in to
the euro/dollar rate at the moment. There's no catalyst for a
weaker euro yet but the negative cycle is building,"" he said.
 The Australian dollar slipped 0.4 percent to $1.0010 after
shedding 1.2 percent the previous day, when gold and oil both
fell more than 2 percent.
 Traders said stop-loss selling weighed on the Australian
dollar on Wednesday. It has taken a hit this week as investors
fear that widespread floods in the country's northeast will hit
production of coal, the nation's biggest export.
 A year-end rally in thin trade had driven the Aussie to a
28-year high around $1.0257 last Friday.

 * Industrial orders jump 1.4 pct from September to October
 
(Recasts with economists' comments)
 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - A surge in energy costs drove up
euro zone producer prices in November, pointing to rising
inflationary pressures as a rebound in industrial new orders
showed the recovery in manufacturing gaining traction last year.
 The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said prices
at factory gates in the 16 countries using the euro in November
were 0.3 percent higher than in October and 4.5 percent higher
year-on-year.
 Economists polled by Reuters had expected the monthly
increase and had pencilled in a 4.4 percent annual rise.
 ""Pipeline price pressures are clearly on the rise, and this
extends beyond food and energy,"" said Martin van Vliet,
economist at ING bank.
 A separate more forward-looking purchasing managers survey
on Wednesday showed growth in the euro zone services sector
slowed in December as activity in Ireland and Spain shrank,
highlighting the two-speed nature of the region's recovery.
 That, like the beginnings of a pick up in producers' prices,
points to tensions in policymaking for the whole region which
may become more problematic for the European Central Bank later
in the year.
 The growth of producer prices, which translate into consumer
price increases unless absorbed by intermediaries and retailers,
was driven mainly by a 0.9 percent monthly increase and a 8.8
percent annual jump in the costs of energy.
 Van Vliet said that excluding the more volatile prices of
food and energy, producer prices rose 4.1 percent year-on-year.
 ""However, we strongly doubt whether the pick-up in core
producer prices signals an imminent pick-up in core consumer
goods inflation. We suspect that given the still-fragile
consumer demand backdrop, higher producer prices will be passed
on only partly to consumer prices,"" he said.
 
 RATES NOT AN ISSUE YET
 Consumer inflation jumped to 2.2 percent in December, an
early estimate showed on Tuesday, the highest rate in more than
two years and above the European Central Bank's target of below,
but close to 2 percent.
 ""It is far too early to talk about second round effects and
severe risks to price stability, but all indicators on the ECB
monetary policymaking compass are pointing northward,"" said ING
economist Carsten Brzeski.
 ""Rate hikes will not be an issue now but it will not make
ECB policymaking easier. If it wasn't for the sovereign debt
crisis, a hike could be justifed soon,"" Brzeski said.
 Most recent Reuters polling shows economists believe the ECB
may keep rates on hold at 1.0 percent until at least the fourth
quarter of this year, with some having pushed back forecasts for
a first rise into 2012. 
 Separately, Eurostat said industrial new orders in the euro
zone in October rebounded from a September slump and rose 1.4
percent month-on-month for a 14.8 percent year-on-year gain.
 The monthly rise in orders was mainly thanks to a 5 percent
jump in demand for durable consumer goods.
 Excluding volatile orders for ships, planes and trains,
orders rose 0.9 percent on the month for a 14.4 percent annual
gain.
 ""The indications are that the industrial sector will have
made a decent contribution to euro zone GDP growth in the fourth
quarter,"" said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight.
 Economists expect that euro zone growth may have slowed to
around 0.2-0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter in the last three
months of 2010 from 0.4 percent in the third quarter.

(Adds details)
 TOKYO, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp President Akio
Toyoda said on Wednesday Japan needs the dollar to trade at a
minimum of 90 yen to protect the country's jobs and remain
competitive as a manufacturing power.
 ""In order to protect Japanese 'monozukuri' (manufacturing)
and jobs, I think 90 yen is the minimum line,"" Toyoda told
reporters at an industry gathering in Tokyo.
 ""(The dollar) has been in the 80s for a very long time, and
each company is doing its best to (withstand the pain). But if
this keeps up, we (Japan) can't fight to remain a manufacturing
base in the world.""
 Toyoda has said he wants to maintain domestic production of
at least 3 million vehicles a year for Toyota in Japan, in what
could keep it more exposed to a strong yen compared with rivals
Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co.
 On Wednesday, the dollar was changing hands around 82 yen,
compared with its postwar low of 79.75 yen marked in 1995. A
strong yen erodes Japanese exporters' overseas profits when
repatriated.
 Toyota faces headwinds of a sinking Japanese car market,
while sales in its biggest market, the United States, also
underperformed last year.
 But Toyoda noted that Toyota had achieved the three goals it
set out for itself in the United States for 2010, indicating he
was not unhappy with being the only major brand to post a decline
in sales last year.
 Toyota had aimed for Camry to be the top-selling passenger
car, Toyota to be the No.1 brand among retail customers, and for
Lexus to be the best-selling premium brand, he said.
 ""We achieved all three, and against all the headwinds,""
Toyoda said. ""I'm grateful to the dealerships and our U.S. arm,
and I think we have a lot to be proud of.""
 With its worst recall crisis gradually dissipating, Toyoda
said he wanted to outline Toyota's corporate vision for 2020 in
the coming months.
 ""I think what people want to know now is what kind of fruits
our efforts will bear. We're working on that now, and hope to
announce that around spring,"" he said.

(Adds more CEO comments, background)
 By Walter Gibbs and Camilla Knudsen
 OSLO, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Norway's Yara International is keen
to take part in consolidation sweeping the world's crop nutrient
industry, and is well-placed to buy due to its high stock price,
Chief Executive Joergen Ole Haslestad told Reuters.
 ""We are optimistic that there are things out there to buy
but obviously they are expensive,"" Haslestad said on the
sidelines of a conference by Norway's main employers' body.
 ""We are looking around the whole world,"" he said, adding
that ""it can also happen relatively fast.""
 The company has said it has plans to capture 20 percent of
the global nitrogen-based fertiliser market but its $4.1 billion
bid for U.S. rival Terra Industries was trumped in February by
CF Industries.
 Yara has eyed Canada's Potash Corp assets as well.
 Haslestad said Yara was evaluating possible acquisitions on
a global basis but that he is sceptical of investments in Russia
and Eastern Europe where risks are higher.
 Yara, profiting from a tighter supply in agricultural
markets, still has an optimistic view on fertiliser prices. A
month ago it raised its 2011 earnings forecasts on Tuesday on
the back of strong demand for its nitrogen-based soil nutrient.

 By Mike Dolan and Jeremy Gaunt
 LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - World equities, oil prices and the
euro retreated from early new year highs on Wednesday, with
underlying economic optimism reined in by wariness about
lingering debt woes, possible data surprises and wildcard risks.
 In a pattern investors say may well be repeated throughout
2011, a burst of new year investor optimism over the past week
quickly fell prey to profit taking and correlation trading that
automatically links moves in one security to the buying or
selling of another.
 Commodity price falls -- which some say were accelerated by
a fall in the flood-hit Australian dollar and generalised U.S.
dollar strength -- continued for a second day in a row. This, in
turn, all put pressure on previously buoyant world equities.
 Oil, which had only a few days ago looked to be heading to
$100 a barrel again, fell back below $89 a barrel in London..
Prices of both commodities and equities, however, remained
around at multi-year highs.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were down 0.5 percent,
though still within a few points of highs last seen in the third
quarter of 2008.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 was down 1.0 percent. Earlier,
Japan's Nikkei closed down nearly 0.2 percent after hitting a
7-1/2 month closing high on Tuesday.
 ""There might just be an element of nerves creeping back into
the market as investors return to their desks,"" said Keith
Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
 
 NEW YEAR HANGOVER
 A number of market moves were put down to investors
adjusting positions after end-of-year balancing of portfolios.
 Investors were also awaiting U.S. jobs data due on Friday
for confirmation that the world's largest economy is recovering,
a key factor in recent equity rallies. A early cut of the
month's private-sector employment reading was due on Wednesday.
 ""Growth in the labour market is one of the biggest deciding
factors for markets this year, that is why we are seeing
investors a bit cautious ahead of the (jobs) numbers. If the job
figures are good, we could see a push higher,"" said David Jones,
market strategist at IG Index. 
 The ADP National employment survey for December, a precursor
to Friday's non-farm payrolls report, was due at 1315 GMT while
U.S. ISM non-manufacturing data was set for 1500 GMT.
 ""There is some optimism with regards to the U.S. economy,
but that is mixed with concerns over where Europe is going in
the short- to medium-term. We are likely to remain very data
sensitive,"" Bowman at Hargreaves Lansdown said.
 Stocks related to commodities acted as the main drag on
bourses. Anglo American, BHP Billiton, Kazakhmys and Rio Tinto
shed 1.5 percent to 3 percent.
 Commodities were hit hard on Tuesday, with the
Reuters-Jefferies CRB index closing nearly 1.6 percent down as
energy, metals and agricultural investors took profits on the
heady gains made on thin holiday volume over the past two weeks.

 The sell-off continued in some areas on Wednesday. Copper
futures, for example, fell two percent in London. The Australian
dollar was down about 0.5 percent.
 European chemical shares were among the fallers, with the
STOXX Europe 600 chemicals index down 1.6 percent on concerns
about a slowdown in world demand.
 Chemicals market leader BASF fell 3.3 percent, with traders
pointing to profit taking following a strong run. The stock had
gained almost 22 percent since early October.
 
 FIRMER DOLLAR
 The dollar took some of the blame for commodities' slide,
holding firm on hopes for U.S. economic recovery.
 Market players said the dollar's rise and the partly related
drop in commodities this week have been driven by position
unwinding.
 ""The move over the past two weeks was somewhat exaggerated,
having taken place in thin liquidity. With liquidity now coming
back on stream, the markets are now reassessing some of the
moves,"" said Sue Trinh, strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value
against major currencies, rose 0.4 percent to 79.75.
 The euro dipped 0.6 percent to $1.3212, with traders nervy
over the higher yields paid by Portugal at its latest Treasury
bill auction on Wednesday and reports about European Union plans
to insist in future on senior creditors accepting writedowns on
the debt of ailing EU banks.
 Core German government bond yields fell as demand grew for
safer assets and peripheral euro government debt yields climbed
after the Portuguese auction.
 ""On the face of it the auction met solid demand given the
healthy cover ratio, though this obviously comes at a much
higher yield than the previous six-month Portuguese offering
last September,"" said Credit Agricole strategist Orlando Green.

dollar assets to limit losses on its foreign currency reserves,
while letting the yuan move more freely, a former adviser to the
People's Bank of China said in comments published on Wednesday.
 ""China should now reduce its holdings of dollar assets as far
as possible, rather than increasing holdings,"" Yu Yongding, an
academic member of the central bank's monetary policy committee
until 2006, wrote in an article in the latest edition of Caijing
magazine.
 ""This means the central bank, to avoid further rises in
foreign exchange reserves, must reduce its intervention in the
foreign exchange market,"" he said.
 ""Reducing intervention means the exchange rate will
appreciate in line with market supply and demand,"" he added.
 China's foreign exchange reserves, the world's largest, hit a
record $2.65 trillion at the end of September, a reflection of
heavy-handed intervention to hold down the yuan's value.
 The government must let the public know that modest yuan
appreciation is in line with China's own interests and is not
bowing to U.S. pressure, Yu wrote.
 Yu, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a
top government think-tank, has long championed a more
market-driven exchange rate regime.
 Yu has also long held a bearish outlook on the U.S. dollar,
which he reiterated. Monetary easing to stimulate the flagging
U.S. economy may in reality fuel U.S. public debt and inflation,
which in turn pointed to persistent dollar weakness, he said.
 The real purpose of the policy easing was to accelerate the
dollar's depreciation and boost U.S. export competitiveness, he
said.
 ""Facing the dollar's depreciation and worsening inflation,
holders of U.S. government debt, particularly foreign holders,
will dump U.S. debt to avoid further losses,"" he said.

 By Ian Chua and Masayuki Kitano
 SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The dollar held firm
on Wednesday up by further evidence that U.S. economic
recovery is becoming self-sustained, while a correction in
high-flying commodity prices pressured the Australian dollar.
 Market players said the dollar's rise and a drop in
commodities this week was driven by position unwinding, with
investors trimming back some of the bets made before the
year-end.
 ""The move over the past two weeks was somewhat
exaggerated, having taken place in thin liquidity. With
liquidity now coming back on stream, the markets are now
reassessing some of the moves,"" said Sue Trinh, strategist at
RBC Capital Markets.
 ""Hence we've seen a bit of paring back of U.S. dollar
losses. The same goes for commodity prices as well, they've
extended themselves very much over the holiday period, so a
little bit of consolidation is to be expected,"" Trinh said.
 The dollar index, which measures its value against major
currencies, edged up 0.1 percent to 79.533 <.DXY>. The dollar
index is up 0.6 percent this week, having regained some ground
after sliding 1.8 percent last week.
 A recent series of economic data has raised hopes for a
sustainable U.S. recovery and lent support to the dollar. The
latest such indicator was data on Tuesday that showed new
orders received by U.S. factories rose unexpectedly in November.
 The euro dipped 0.2 percent to $1.3284  and the
dollar held steady against the yen at 82.08 yen .
 AUSSIE SHAKY
 Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Trust & Banking
in Tokyo, warned against reading too much into the previous
day's slide in commodities.
 ""As long as economic growth in emerging countries stays
firm, especially in China, commodities will likely stay on an
upward trend. But there will surely be some profit-taking from
time to time if prices go too high,"" Sera said.
 The Australian dollar slipped 0.2 percent to $1.0037
, extending its losses after shedding 1.2 percent the
previous day, when gold  and oil  both fell more
than 2 percent.
 A trader for a European bank in Singapore said stop-loss
selling weighed on the Australian dollar on Wednesday, with
talk of more stops all the way down toward parity. Another
trader said there were some bids for the Aussie just below
parity.
 The Australian currency has taken a hit this week as
investors fear that widespread floods in the country's
northeast will hit production of coal, the nation's biggest
export.
 A year-end rally in thin trade had driven the Aussie to a
28-year high around $1.0257 last Friday, pushing the relative
strength index (RSI) towards overbought territory and setting
the scene for a consolidation in the short-term.
 Concerns about the impact of the Australian floods are
likely to continue to pressure the currency, especially
against other commodity-linked currencies such as the Canadian
dollar, said David Forrester, FX strategist at Barclays
Capital in Singapore.
 ""Our equity analysts think that a lot of the coal mines in
Queensland could be shut down for two to three months. So
that's going to be a substantial hit to exports going
forward,"" he said.
 Over the next three months, the Australian dollar is
likely to retreat to around $0.99, on the back of a stronger
U.S. dollar, Forrester said.
 ""We still think we may have more problems out of Europe to
come yet. In particular we think that Portugal may need
assistance, so that will lead to a stronger dollar,"" he said.

 * Yuan appreciation will not help U.S. - commerce official	
 * China should let yuan move more freely -ex-c.bank adviser	

(Adds former c.bank adviser comment)	
 BEIJING, Jan 5 (Reuters) - China will let the yuan rise
about 5 percent against the dollar in 2011 to combat
inflation, an official newspaper said on Wednesday, while a
former central bank adviser said the country needs to free up
the currency.	
 But a Commerce Ministry official warned that any
appreciation would do little to narrow China's trade surplus
with the United States, a constant irritant in the
relationship between the world's two largest economies.	
 The yuan's gains would be particularly strong in the first
half of this year, the China Securities Journal said in a
front-page editorial.	
 ""Yuan appreciation will make imports cheaper to reduce the
impact of rising commodity prices in the international market,
providing relief from inflationary pressure,"" it said.	
 The Chinese-language newspaper is a leading voice on
domestic economic affairs. Its views do not represent official
policy, but do shed light on thinking in Beijing.	
 Investors expect the yuan to be about 3 percent higher in
a year's time, according to pricing in offshore forwards
markets. 
 China let the yuan rise just 3.6 percent in 2010.	
 But China-based traders expect the yuan to appreciate
about 2 percent in the first quarter of 2011 alone, partly
propelled by President Hu Jintao's visit to the United States
in mid-January.	
 
 TRADE SURPLUS	
 But Vice Commerce Minister Jiang Yaoping said appreciation
would have limited impact on reducing China's trade surplus
with the United States.	
 Jiang noted that much of the imbalance was explained by
the processing trade in which multinational companies import
intermediate goods and assemble them as finished products in
China before exporting them to the United States.	
 ""We have adjusted the yuan's exchange rate since 2005, but
we can see that China's trade surplus with the United States,
especially the surplus in the processing trade, basically did
not change,"" he told a forum on Wednesday. ""That is to say,
the yuan's exchange rate has no big impact on the trade
surplus.""	
 U.S. President Barack Obama's national security adviser
pressed for efforts to reduce U.S.-China trade imbalances in
talks on Tuesday with China's foreign minister. [ID:nN04247778]	
 Obama, who joined the meeting with Chinese Foreign
Minister Yang Jiechi, reaffirmed a commitment to improve
global cooperation with Beijing as he prepared to host
President Hu on a state visit to Washington on Jan. 19, the
White House said.	
 While Beijing and Washington are likely to use the summit
to cast their relationship in a positive light, strains over
China's currency and trade practices are expected to loom large.	
 U.S. national security adviser Tom Donilon ""stressed the
importance of effective efforts to reduce imbalances in both
the global economy as well as in U.S.-China trade"", the White
House said in a summary of Tuesday's wide-ranging talks.	
 U.S. complaints that China keeps the yuan too cheap,
giving it an unfair trade advantage, are likely to feature in
the meeting between Obama and Hu. The U.S. trade deficit with
China rose 20 percent in the first 10 months of 2010 and could
top $270 billion for the year.	
 While the central government generally tries to paint a
picture that it resists U.S. pressure for yuan appreciation,
in reality it has often allowed it to strengthen ahead of
major political events in recognition of the importance of
bilateral ties.	
 
 CUT DOLLAR HOLDINGS	
 Yu Yongding, a former adviser to the People's Bank of
China, said the central bank must reduce its intervention in
the currency market to let the yuan move in line with market
forces, which would help cap the growth of the country's
foreign exchange reserves.	
 ""China should now reduce its holdings of dollar assets as
far as possible, rather than increasing holdings,"" Yu, an
academic member of the central bank's monetary policy
committee until 2006, wrote in an article in Caijing magazine.	
 ""This means the central bank, to avoid further rises in
foreign exchange reserves, must reduce its intervention in the
foreign exchange market. Reducing intervention means the
exchange rate will appreciate in line with market supply and
demand,"" he added.	
 China's reserves, the world's largest, hit a record $2.65
trillion at the end of September, a reflection of heavy-handed
intervention to hold down the yuan's value.

 By Sanjeev Miglani	
 SINGAPORE, Jan 5 (Reuters) - A sudden drop in commodity
prices prompted investors to take profits on Asian stocks on
Wednesday while the U.S. dollar held firm ahead of job data
due later in the week, though the bull market in raw materials
was seen as far from over.	
 Oil fell for a second day to near $89 a barrel, extending
the previous session's 2.4 percent drop as investors sold off
commodities after a strong year-end rally. Gold inched up,
though, after sinking more than 2 percent on Tuesday.	
 S&P futures  slipped 0.2 percent, pointing to a
softer opening on Wall Street later in the day.	
 The fall in commodities to their lowest level in seven
weeks and a stronger dollar weighed on shares of resource
companies in Asian trade, although market analysts said it was
likely to have only a limited impact. 
 ""As long as emerging nations keep their firm economies,
notably China, commodities will likely stay on an upward
trend, but there will surely be some profit-taking from time
to time if prices go too high,"" said Ayako Sera, market
strategist at Sumitomo Trust & Banking in Tokyo.	
 
 The MSCI index of Asian shares excluding Japan
fell 0.70 percent with technology and energy
sectors the biggest decliners, while the consumer
discretionary sector outperformed.	
 Shares in Hyundai Motor Co rose 6.2 percent on
strong U.S. auto sales and a court approval for its takeover
of top builder Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co Ltd
. [ID:nTOE70306C]. The broader KOSPI was
down 0.19 percent.	
 Australian stocks fell 0.6 percent, pulling the index to
its lowest close in nearly a month, hurt by the commodities
sell-off and fears that massive floods in northern Queesland
state would hurt miners. The Australian dollar fell to
one-week lows.	
 Japan's benchmark Nikkei closed down 0.2 percent,
with investors largely shrugging off concerns about commodity
prices and looking instead to U.S. non-farm payrolls data on
Friday to provide further evidence of a sustained economy
recovery.	
 ""Investors are focusing on the U.S. payroll data, so they
may stay on the sidelines for this week, but the mood is
positive,"" said Hiroichi Nishi, general manager at Nikko
Cordial Securities.	
 The U.S. dollar bounced from three-week lows against the
euro on Tuesday and held firm in Asia trade at around 82 yen
after upbeat U.S. maufacturing data, and more gains are
seen likely given the heavy sales of euro zone bonds
anticipated this year.	
 The dollar index, which measures its value against major
currencies, edged up 0.2 percent to 79.577 . The dollar
index is up around 0.6 percent this week, having regained some
ground after sliding 1.8 percent last week.	
 ""Incoming U.S. data is quite good and that's part of the
reason why I think the dollar is going to remain with a
reasonable bid tone,"" said Richard Grace, chief currency
strategist at Commonwealth Bank.	
 There was little reaction in Asian markets to minutes of
the Federal Reserve's December meeting released on Tuesday,
which revealed policy makers felt the U.S. economy still
needed help despite signs of strength. [ID:nFEDAHEAD] 
 The U.S. economy, having emerged from its deepest
recession in generations in the summer of 2009, has since
expanded in fits and starts. Gross domestic product rose at a
2.6 percent annual rate in the third quarter, a pace still
seen as too low to bring down the country's 9.8 percent
jobless rate.	
 U.S. Treasuries inched up in Asia on Wednesday as
investor appetite for riskier assets like stocks and
commodities cooled slightly after a bullish start to the year. 
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 3/32
in price to yield 3.31 percent, down about 2 basis points from
late U.S. trade on Tuesday. 
 The stronger dollar weighed on copper futures in London
and Shanghai after prices slid from record highs in the
previous session.	
 Crude oil  slipped 20 cents to $89.18 a barrel,
extending Tueday's losses, but spot gold rose 0.3
percent to $1,383.40 an ounce.

 * Finance Minister Guido Mantega announces no new measures

(Adds comments from Mexico, updates prices)
 By Samantha Pearson and Brad Haynes
 SAO PAULO/SANTIAGO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Chile's peso suffered
its biggest daily drop in more than 25 years on Tuesday on
tough new intervention plans while the Brazilian real recovered
after Brasilia stopped short of introducing further measures.
 The Chilean peso  slumped as much as 4.9 percent to
489.60 per dollar. It later closed 4.5 percent down at a 9-week
low of 487.60 -- its biggest daily loss since February 1985,
according to daily central bank data.
 Brazil's real  also weakened sharply after the
government announced it would hold a news conference in the
afternoon to tackle foreign exchange issues, prompting
speculation fresh measures could be announced.
 But Finance Minister Guido Mantega said very little and
only reiterated that the government was ready to act, causing
the real immediately to pare losses.
 Chile has taken one of the most hands-off approaches in
Latin America to its foreign exchange market. But it surprised
investors late on Monday with a massive dollar-buying plan.
 The central bank announced it will buy $12 billion to tame
the peso, which has appreciated more than 17 percent against
the greenback since the end of June. For details, see
[ID:nN03137860].
 Like many attractive emerging economies across Latin
America and Asia, Chile has struggled with currency
appreciation that has made its exports more difficult to sell
abroad and flooded the country with cheap imports.

Graphic on region's currencies: http://r.reuters.com/cat64r

 Chile's surprise move added to existing concerns about
intervention across the region as it could give countries such
as Brazil an excuse to implement more currency measures.
 ""If the pretty conservative Chilean central bank
intervenes, what can you expect of the Brazilian central bank!""
said Pedro Tuesta, senior Latin America economist at research
firm 4Cast Inc in Washington.
 However, others played down a possible regional impact.
 ""Chile is just the last domino to fall into intervention. I
don't think it changes others' attitudes as they are already
intervening,"" said Tony Volpon, head of emerging markets
research for the Americas at Nomura in New York.
 BRAZIL: KING OF INTERVENTION
 The Brazilian real pared its losses to close 0.79 percent
weaker at 1.662 per dollar on the local spot market, after
closing at its strongest level since Sept. 1 2008 in the
previous session.
 Brazil's trade and industry minister said on Monday the
country would not remain ""passive"" while the real continues to
strengthen.
 Latin America's biggest economy has already taken the lead
in the region when it comes to intervention, buying vast
amounts of dollars on a daily basis and raising taxes on
inflows. But investors worry the government could increase
those levies even further and take other measures, such as
intervening in the futures market. For possible measures, see
[ID:nN01117570].
 Mexico is now the only major Latin American country that is
not heavily intervening in its currency market, partly because
the peso is fully convertible and thus more widely traded and
harder to control.
 The country has also suffered more from the financial
crisis, which means it has not seen the flood of
currency-boosting investment experienced by Chile and Brazil.
 The Mexican peso  gained 0.14 percent to 12.2318 per
dollar, even as U.S. stocks were mixed.
 ""If you believe that intervention in Mexico is pretty
moderate and subtle, then the peso become more attractive in
the eyes of investors,"" said Luis Flores, an economist at
brokerage IXE in Mexico City.

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Commodity prices fell sharply
on Tuesday as investors took advantage of record high prices to
take profits, a move accelerated by a rally in the U.S.
dollar.
 Wall Street also pulled back after a strong December
boosted equities to two-year highs, with consumer and energy
stocks weaker.
 The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB> of commodity prices
dropped 2 percent in its sharpest one-day fall since
mid-November
 European shares closed at a one-week high, boosted by gains
in shares of oil companies before the price of crude oil began
to slide. Strong manufacturing data from around the world
boosted commodity prices earlier in the day.
 U.S. crude for February delivery  settled down $2.17,
or 2.37 percent, to $89.38 per barrel, a day after hitting a
27-month high.
 ""We had an end-of-year runup and now we are getting the
beginning of the year selloff,"" said Stephen Schork, president
at the Schork Group in Villanova, Pennsylvania.
 The profit-taking overwhelmed upbeat economic data. An
unexpected increase in U.S. factory orders in November reported
on Tuesday underpinned recent evidence that the economic
recovery was on a sustainable path. Orders, excluding
transportation, recorded their largest gain in eight months.
[ID:nN04219375]
 In minutes from a December meeting released on Tuesday,
Federal Reserve officials said the U.S. economic recovery was
still weak enough to warrant monetary support despite growing
signs of strength. [ID:nWAL4CE7W1]
 Strength in the U.S. dollar added to the commodity selloff
since a stronger dollar makes purchasing many raw materials
more expensive. Commodity-related currencies, like the Canadian
and Australian dollars, fell with the decline in the price of
oil.
 On Wall Street, weak consumer stocks and a prediction by
Morgan Stanley that the benchmark S&P 500 will lose ground in
2011 weighed on sentiment a day after the S&P 500 and the Dow
hit two-year highs.
 Worries that rising costs of commodities such as soybeans
and corn will sap supermarket profits hurt consumer stocks and
dented growing optimism about the economic outlook.
 S&P 500, NASDAQ INDICES FALL
 In midday trade the major indexes were mixed. The Dow Jones
industrial average <.DJI> rose 9.04 points, or 0.08 percent, at
11,679.87. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> lost 3.64
points, or 0.29 percent, at 1,268.23. The Nasdaq Composite
Index <.IXIC> dropped 12.22 points, or 0.45 percent, at
2,679.30.
 Morgan Stanley forecast a base case year-end target for the
S&P 500 at 1,238, below the close for 2010. The firm's
risk-reward scenario for 2011 was ""skewed to the negative.""
 Shares of Supervalu Inc  tumbled 5.8 percent after
Morgan Stanley told investors to cut holdings in the stock,
saying rising food costs will crimp margins.
 ""We're light on consumer staples. One of our concerns is
commodity prices are going to bite into profits,"" said Thomas
Villalta, portfolio manager for Jones Villalta Asset Management
in Austin, Texas.
 S&P's energy share index fell 0.94 percent <.GSPE>.
 Activity across all commodity markets picked up
dramatically as traders returned from holiday, with volume at
mid-session already in excess of any day over the past two
weeks.
 Prices for gold and corn fell over 2 percent; copper lost
1.75 percent.
 ""It's a healthy correction in copper,"" said Sean
McGillivray, vice president at Oregon-based Great Pacific
Wealth Management.
 Spot gold prices tumbled below $1,400 an ounce, losing
$35.70, or 2.53 percent, to $1378.10 .
 Copper dropped 7.75 cents to $4.37 per pound in New York
trade , down from Monday's record high.
 While commodity prices are lower on the day, they remain
near multiyear or record highs.
 In currency markets, the euro was down 0.3 percent from
late on Monday at $1.3316  after hitting three-week
peaks at $1.3435.
 The dollar gained 0.40 percent to 82.05 yen. Against a
basket of major trading partner currencies, the greenback rose
0.36 percent <.DXY>.
 The MSCI All-Country World index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.04

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The dollar rebounded from
three-week lows against the euro on Tuesday as unexpectedly
strong U.S. economic data bolstered the greenback's appeal,
with more gains seen likely given concerns over the euro area's
bond issuance.
 Data showed new orders received by U.S. factories rose in
November and orders excluding transportation recorded their
largest gain in eight months, fueling dollar buying versus the
euro. For details, see
 Traders also said the lapse of the New York expiry in
euro/dollar, where there are reportedly option-related bids in
the $1.3400 region, contributed to the euro zone single
currency's retreat. Those vanilla bids in the euro had kept the
euro partly supported throughout the Asian and London session.
 ""There's always a bearish case for the euro because of the
debt situation. That will keep coming back so it's unclear to
me ... the upside for owning the euro in a big way,"" said Aston
Chan, portfolio manager at global macro hedge fund GLC in
London. GLC has assets under management of $1.2 billion.
 In early afternoon New York trading, the euro was down 0.3
percent from late on Monday at $1.3323 after hitting three-week
peaks at $1.3435. More support lies at $1.3280 and $1.3250,
Monday's lows, traders said.
 A fall below key support at $1.3250 could prompt more
selling in the euro as traders target the 200-day moving
average just below $1.3100.
 Meanwhile, a nearly 3 percent drop in crude oil prices,
promoted the dollar to outperform commodity-sensitive
currencies.
 The greenback rose to a session peak of 1.0033 Canadian
dollars, according to Reuters data. It was last at 1.0002
Canadian dollars, up about 0.7 percent on the day.
 The Canadian dollar on Dec. 31 traded and closed through
parity. Its recent move to parity has been on the back of
stronger commodity prices.
 Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital
in Toronto, said they expect USDCAD to hover either side of
parity in the near-term, but that it is sustainable through
parity and will close the year at lower levels than it is
trading currently.
 ""We expect today's USDCAD range to fall between 0.9889 and
0.9980"" recent congestion, she wrote.
 Against the yen, the euro was 0.05 percent lower on the day
at 109.08.
 Meanwhile, market participants mulled minutes of the
Federal Open Market Committee's Dec. 14 meeting.
 Federal Reserve officials in December felt the U.S.
economic recovery was still weak enough to warrant monetary
support despite growing signs of strength, the minutes released
on Tuesday showed. For details, see
 Volatility in major currencies is still elevated,
suggesting investors in the options market remained nervous
about global growth prospects. For instance, one-month
euro/dollar implied volatility on Monday hit a one-month high
at 14.00 percent, although on Tuesday, it slipped a bit to
13.10.
 At the same time, back-end vols in euro/dollar have
remained firm and continue to trade with a premium over the
short end of the curve.
 ""Our base case remains focused on the risk of a sharp fall
in the euro over the coming year, reflecting the ongoing fiscal
struggles in the euro zone periphery and the need for the
exchange rate to provide some offset for the overall adjustment
process,"" wrote TD Securities in a research note.
 In the next two months an estimated 150-200 billion euros
of government bonds are scheduled to be issued by euro zone
countries, some of whom are struggling with rising budget
deficits and higher borrowing costs. That should further cloud
prospects for the euro.
 TD added that euro/dollar gains are liable to remain
limited to the $1.3450 area in the short run, not far from the
highs seen in December.
 Meanwhile, currency investors remained riveted on the
Australian dollar, which fell as severe floods in north-east
Australia are expected to impact coal production, a major
contributor to its economy.
 The Aussie dollar fell 1.1 percent to US$1.0054, retreating
from a 28-year peak around US$1.0257 set on Friday. Traders
said funds sold Aussie for euros, taking profits on long Aussie
positions taken in the run-up to the end of 2010.

 By Tarek Amara
 TUNIS, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Tunisian police used tear gas to
disperse a protest by hundreds of students on Tuesday in a town
in the west of the country, witnesses said, as violent protests
broke out again after a brief lull.
 ""Hundreds of students took to the streets this morning in
solidarity with the youths of Sidi Bouzid. Jobless (people) soon
joined the protests which turned into clashes with the police,
who used tear gas to disperse the protesters,"" eyewitness
Belgacem Saihi said from Thala, where the protest took place.
 Tunisian officials could not immediately comment on the
account given by Saihi, but it was confirmed by Jamal Boulabi,
who heads the teachers' union in Thala.
 Boulabi said students from Thala's four colleges took part
in the protest. ""They (police) are now surrounding teachers and
students inside our college, refusing to let anyone leave the
college ... There are some cases of asphyxiation ... because of
the tear gas"".
 Clashes started last month in the central town of Sidi
Bouzid after a man in his twenties attempted suicide by setting
himself on fire in front of a government building to protest
against the confiscation by police of his fruit and vegetable
cart.
 The incident was embraced as a cause celebre by jobless
graduates, unionists and human right activists, and the protests
later spread to other towns including the capital Tunis.
 Until recently protests have been rare in Tunisia, a country
hailed by Western allies as a model of stability and prosperity
in the Arab world, and one which has had only two presidents
since independence from France 55 years ago.
 According to French media two jobless graduates have tried
to kill themselves, at least one dying after electrocuting
himself to protest against ""misery and unemployment"".
 Another young Tunisian was killed when police were forced to
""shoot in self-defence"" to quell rioters in the southern town of
Bouziane, the government said.
 Tunisia has been ruled for the last 23 years by Zine
al-Abidine Ben Ali, who works closely with Western governments
to combat al Qaeda militants.
 He is trying to win from the country's main trade partner,
the European Union, an 'advanced status' partnership, which
implies a more scrupulous respect of public freedoms.
 The government has accused its opponents of manipulating the
Sidi Bouzid clashes last month to discredit the authorities, and
Ben Ali later said that violent protests were unacceptable and
would hurt national interests.
 The wave of protests had died down after Ben Ali named a new
youth minister in a minor government reshuffle -- the second in
2010 -- and a new governor for Sidi Bouzid. Official media said
he had also ordered that 6.5 billion dinars ($4.5 billion) be
mobilised to cut graduate unemployment, now around 25 percent.
 Tunisia has become a regional focus of attention for
financial institutions since announcing a plan to complete
current account convertibility during 2010-12, and full dinar
convertibility in 2013-14.
 Security technology company Sophos said on Monday that
""hacktivists"" from a group calling itself 'Anonymous' had struck
some official Tunisian websites, including those of Ben Ali, the
government and the Tunisian stock exchange.
 The attack was in ""retaliation"" for what the group called
""war on free speech and democracy"" and the blocking by Tunisia
of access to secret U.S. embassy cables released by WikiLeaks.
 ""Your citizens rally in the streets to demand accountability
and their own rights, which you have wrongfully presumed it was
in your purview to take from them,"" the group said in a
statement posted on several websites.
 Asked to confirm the Sophos report, an official at the
Tunisian information technology regulator said ""There is a
problem but we don't know yet what it is all about. It's beyond
us"".

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK , Jan 4 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices tumbled more
than 3 percent on Tuesday and Wall Street indexes slid as
energy shares declined, as a strengthening in the dollar
following surprisingly strong U.S. factory orders spurred
profit-taking after oil's recent rally.
 European shares managed to close at a one-week high,
boosted by gains in oil major shares before the price of crude
oil began to slide. Strong manufacturing data from around the
world had boosted commodity prices earlier in the trading day.
 Crude oil prices  fell $3.10, or 3.39 percent, to
$88.45 per barrel, a day after hitting a 27-month high.
 ""We had an end of year run-up and now we are getting the
beginning of the year sell-off,"" said Stephen Schork, president
at the Schork Group in Villanova, Pennsylvania.
 The profit-taking overwhelmed more upbeat economic data. An
unexpected increase in U.S. factory orders in November reported
on Tuesday underpinned recent evidence that the economic
recovery was on a sustainable path. Orders excluding
transportation recorded their largest gain in eight months.
[ID:nN04219375]
 Strength in the U.S. dollar added to the commodity
sell-off, as its rising value makes it more expensive to
purchase raw materials. And commodity-related currencies, like
the Canadian and Australian dollars, fell with the decline in
the price of oil.
 On Wall Street, weak consumer stocks and a prediction by
Morgan Stanley that the benchmark S&P 500 will lose ground in
2011 weighed on sentiment a day after the S&P 500 and the Dow
hit two-year highs.
 Worries that rising costs of commodities such as soy beans
and corn will sap supermarket profits hurt consumer stocks and
dented growing optimism about the economic outlook.
 WALL STREET INDEXES FALL
 In midday trade the major indexes were all lower. The Dow
Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 30.28 points, or 0.26
percent, at 11,640.47. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX>
lost 8.53 points, or 0.67 percent, at 1,263.34. The Nasdaq
Composite Index <.IXIC> dropped 24.75 points, or 0.92 percent,
at 2,666.77.
 Morgan Stanley forecast a base case year-end target for the
S&P 500 at 1,238, below the close for 2010. The firm's
risk-reward scenario for 2011 was ""skewed to the negative.""
 Shares of Supervalu Inc  tumbled 6.7 percent after
Morgan Stanley told investors to cut holdings in the stock,
saying rising food costs will crimp margins.
 ""We're light on consumer staples. One of our concerns is
commodity prices are going to bite into profits,"" said Thomas
Villalta, portfolio manager for Jones Villalta Asset Management
in Austin, Texas.
 S&P's energy share index fell 1.42 percent <.GSPE>.
 Activity across all commodity markets picked up
dramatically as traders returned from holiday, with volume at
mid-session already in excess of any day over the past two
weeks.
 Prices for gold, copper and corn fell over 2 percent.
 The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB> dropped 2 percent in
its sharpest one-day fall since mid-November
""It's a healthy correction in copper,"" said Sean
McGillivray, vice president at Oregon-based Great Pacific
Wealth Management.
 ""I would fully expect a little bit of profit-taking by the
institutional investors, especially in the precious metals
sector in the first of the year.""
 Spot gold prices tumbled below $1,400 an ounce, losing
$35.70, or 2.53 percent, to $1378.10 .
 Copper dropped 10.15 cents or 2.28 percent to $4.35 per
pound in New York trade , down from Monday's record
high.
 While commodity prices are lower on the day, they remain
near multi-year and record highs.
 In currency markets, the euro was down 0.3 percent from
late on Monday at $1.3306  after hitting three-week
peaks at $1.3435.
 The dollar gained 0.09 percent to 81.78 yen. Against a
basket of major trading partner currencies, the greenback rose
0.43 percent <.DXY>.
 European shares hit their highest closing level in nearly a
week on Tuesday. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3>
index closed 0.86 percent higher at 1,142.02 points.
 The MSCI All-Country World index <.MIWD00000PUS> gave up
its early lead to drop 0.14 percent.
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei <.N225> began the year with a 1.7
percent climb to a 7-1/2 month closing high.
 U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasuries were up just 3/32 of a

 * Hike should signal start of cycle, not be seen as one-off

 By Karolina Slowikowska and Pawel Florkiewicz
 WARSAW, Jan 4 (Reuters) - It is time for Poland's central
bank to begin a gradual monetary tightening cycle to help
strengthen the zloty and cap inflationary expectations, the
bank's governor, Marek Belka, said on Tuesday.
 ""The time for observing the situation in monetary policy is
ending. I definitely believe that rates should be raised
pre-emptively, not just in case,"" Belka told Reuters in an
exclusive interview.
 Belka's comments came one day after MPC member Andrzej
Kazmierczak, who has previously resisted interest rate rises,
told Reuters an increase in borrowing costs may be necessary.
 Both Belka and Kazmierczak voted against a motion to hike
interest rates by a hefty 50 basis points last August, the last
month for which individual voting records have been published.
That motion was defeated by six votes to four.
 ""I believe that such a move should be gradual. A significant
hike could be interpreted as a one-time move but it is about
building market conviction that we are dealing with a cycle,""
said Belka, who heads the 10-member Monetary Policy Council
(MPC) and has the casting vote in the event of a tie on the
panel.
 Asked whether such a rate increase could take place as early
as the next MPC sitting on Jan. 18-19, Belka said:
""If other ""Irelands"" happen then a rate hike would not
achieve its goal and would not initiate zloty appreciation. For
such a hike to initiate this process and be effective, it must
take place at a time of stable markets.""
 Poland's central bank has been in a wait-and-see approach
for months now and analysts expect higher borrowing costs in the
first quarter but are split on the exact timing of a hike.
 The bank's key rate has stood at a record-low of 3.5 percent
since June 2009.
 Inflation probably picked up to 3.1 percent last month, the
finance ministry said on Monday, up from 2.7 percent in
November, and is expected to accelerate in the new year, due
partly to increases in value-added tax. [ID:nLDE7020FV]
 The MPC also rejected proposals for a 50 basis point rate
rise in September and October and for both 50 and 25 basis point
increases in November, though it is not yet known how individual
policymakers voted in those months.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The euro slid from three-week
highs against the dollar on Tuesday, weighed down by
unexpectedly strong U.S. factory numbers, with further pressure
likely given doubts over the euro area's bond issuance.
 Data showed new orders received by U.S. factories rose in
November and orders excluding transportation recorded their
largest gain in eight months, fueling dollar buying versus the
euro.
 The weakness in commodities has also undermined the euro,
which in recent months has moved in tandem with the sector as
global risk appetite improved.
 Traders also said the lapse of the New York expiry in
euro/dollar, where there are reportedly option-related bids in
the $1.3400 region, contributed to the euro zone single
currency's retreat. Those vanilla bids in the euro had kept the
euro partly supported throughout the Asian and London session.
 ""There's always a bearish case for the euro because of the
debt situation. That will keep coming back so it's unclear to
me ... the upside for owning the euro in a big way,"" said Aston
Chan, portfolio manager at global macro hedge fund GLC in
London. GLC has assets under management of $1.2 billion.
 In midday New York trading, the euro was down 0.3 percent
from late on Monday at $1.3306 after hitting three-week peaks
at $1.3435. More support lies at $1.3280 and $1.3250, Monday's
lows, traders said. A fall below key support at $1.3250 could
prompt more selling in the euro as traders target the 200-day
moving average just below $1.3100.
 The euro was supported earlier by the overall improvement
in the global industrial cycle. The euro area purchasing
managers' index (PMI) for December was revised upward on
Monday, suggesting a pick-up in the region's growth momentum.
 Against the yen, the euro reversed gains to trade slightly
lower on the day at 109.18.
 Despite the increase in risk appetite, volatility in major
currencies is still elevated, suggesting investors in the
options market remained nervous about global growth prospects.
For instance, one-month euro/dollar implied volatility on
Monday hit a one-month high at 14.00 percent, although on
Tuesday, it slipped a bit to 13.25.
 At the same time, back-end vols in euro/dollar have
remained firm and continue to trade with a premium over the
short end of the curve.
 ""Our base case remains focused on the risk of a sharp fall
in the euro over the coming year, reflecting the ongoing fiscal
struggles in the euro zone periphery and the need for the
exchange rate to provide some offset for the overall adjustment
process,"" wrote TD Securities in a research note.
 In the next two months an estimated 150-200 billion euros
of government bonds are scheduled to be issued by euro zone
countries, some of whom are struggling with rising budget
deficits and higher borrowing costs. That should further cloud
prospects for the euro.
 TD added that euro/dollar gains are liable to remain
limited to the $1.3450 area in the short run, not far from the
highs seen in December.
 Meanwhile, currency investors remained riveted on the
Australian dollar, which fell as severe floods in north-east
Australia are expected to impact coal production, a major
contributor to its economy.
 The Aussie dollar fell 1.1 percent to US$1.0055, retreating
from a 28-year peak around US$1.0257 set on Friday. Traders
said funds sold Aussie for euros, taking profit on long Aussie
positions taken in the run-up to the end of 2010.
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent to 81.92 yen with traders
seeing offers around 82.50 and near-term resistance at the
55-day moving average of 82.60.
 Positive U.S. economic reports such as data on Monday
showing manufacturing grew at its fastest clip in seven months
in December and construction spending hit a five-month high in
November helped fuel a rally in dollar/yen.
 For Tuesday afternoon, markets are awaiting minutes of the
Federal Open Market Committee's Dec. 14 meeting.

 NEW YORK, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose on
Tuesday, knocking the euro from a three-week peak and pulled
gold prices sharply lower as upbeat manufacturing data helped
lift investor risk appetite, though Wall Street struggled to
maintain gains.
 Weak consumer stocks on Wall Street and a prediction by
Morgan Stanley that the benchmark S&P 500 will lose ground in
2011 weighed on sentiment a day after the S&P 500 and the Dow

 Shares in Europe, where many of the major markets played

 ""No reason that the (U.S.) market is down other than it is

correction out of nowhere only because stocks are up a lot. But
the forward momentum is likely positive, supported by
increasingly good news in the economy,"" said Jim Awad, managing
director of Zephyr Management in New York.
 The U.S. factory orders report dovetailed with stronger
U.S., Chinese and European PMI manufacturing data reported in
recent days and helped lift risk sentiment, along with the
""January effect"" that occurs as fund managers dispense with the
need to settle end-of-year balances.
 Spot gold prices tumbled below $1,400 an ounce, losing
$28.05, or 1.98 percent, to $1,385.70 .
 ""Pressure (on gold) is expected to return over the next

 NEW YORK, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Oil prices slid more than 2
percent on Tuesday, retreating from a 27-month high and
dropping below $90 a barrel, as profit-taking struck the
commodities complex following a rally over the thin holiday
trading period.
 Investors said abrupt selling across energy, metal and
agricultural markets reflected a correction to the rally that
capped 2010, rather than a sudden reversal of the optimism that
made commodities the top asset class last year.
 ""Today's sharp price pullback appeared to represent a raft
of profit taking in conjunction with a broad based exit of
length off of the overall commodity base,"" Jim Ritterbusch,
president at Ritterbusch & Associates in Galena, Illinois, said
in a note.
 Some additional pressure came from a rebound by the dollar,
which turned positive on an improving U.S. economic outlook.
(Graphic: http://r.reuters.com/ces64r)
 U.S. crude oil for February delivery  fell $2.17, or
2.37 percent, to settle at $89.38 a barrel, off an early peak
of $92.07, but settling well above the $88.36 intraday low.
 The slide was the biggest single-day percentage loss since
Nov. 16, when prices closed 2.97 percent lower.
 Total U.S. crude futures trading volume rebounded from thin
holiday volumes, trading 761,173 lots, well above the 250-day
average of 670,799 lots, according to Reuters data.
 In London, ICE Brent crude for February  fell $1.31
to settle at $93.53, well off an early $95.74 peak.
 Brent crude's premium to the U.S. benchmark West Texas
Intermediate crude  rose to as much as $4.27 a
barrel intraday on Tuesday, the highest since September, with a
tight nearby supply picture and expectations for lower Nigerian
exports [ID:nLDE7030UU] cited as factors by brokers.
 Oil prices pared losses after the December Federal Open
Market Committee minutes said the Federal Reserve would stick
to its $600 billion bond-buying program. [ID:nWAL4CE7W1].
 The Fed's stimulative policies are viewed as bearish for
the U.S. dollar. A weaker dollar typically lifts prices of
dollar-denominated oil because it lowers the value of
greenbacks paid producers and makes oil less expensive for
consumers using other currencies.
 Copper, gold, cocoa and sugar all fell sharply. The
Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB> dropped 2 percent in its
sharpest one-day fall since mid-November. [COM/WRAP]
 The retreat by U.S. oil futures came after they settled at
a 27-month peak above $91 a barrel on Monday as U.S. and
European manufacturing data suggested improving economic growth
that could bolster oil demand.
 ""Built into pricing for commodities was a premium for
flight to safety,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again
Capital LLC in New York.
 ""With the economic recovery now in plain view and equities
coming back into favor, that vestige of safety is losing its
appeal. It's happening with oil and there's a similar free fall
in precious metals.""
 EYEING U.S. OIL INVENTORIES
 U.S. crude prices held losses in post-settlement trading
after industry group the American Petroleum Institute's weekly
inventory report showed crude oil stockpiles fell 7.5 million
barrels, much more than expected. [API/S]
 Distillate stocks rose 2.2 million barrels and gasoline
stocks rose 5.6 million barrels, both up more than expected.
 Ahead of weekly oil inventory reports, U.S. crude oil
stocks were estimated to have fallen by 1.8 million barrels
last week in a Reuters survey of analysts. [EIA/S]
 Distillate stocks were expected to be up 400,000 and
gasoline stocks up 300,000 barrels.
 Traders noted that there was an expectation that oil
inventories will rebound in the new year and provide pressure
on prices after companies drew down stored supplies for tax
reasons at the tail end of 2010.

day-to-day support, and their leaders preoccupied fighting off
internal and external attacks, that they lack the authority or
political capital to effectively conduct the business of
government, including passing sometimes-unpopular laws. 
What to watch: 
-- This year's budget in Japan. Government action is needed
to deal with deep-rooted problems, most pressingly the burden
of huge public debt twice the size of the $5 trillion
economy. The ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) has for
months been firefighting rather than taking the tough steps
economists say are needed to boost growth. A key test will be
passing the budget for the fiscal year 2011/2012, which starts
in April. 
-- Snap election in Japan. If the government, which has
already had to reach out to a smaller party in order to get
laws through parliament, finds deadlock so great that it
cannot pass the budget, Kan may feel compelled to call a snap
election. In any case, voters will get the chance to express
discontent with the DPJ in April municipal elections. Even if
the party performs worse than expected, Kan is unlikely to
resign, not least because there are few if any obvious
replacements, and yet another new leader -- Kan is the
country's fifth since 2006 -- would not solve its problems.
[ID:nTOE6BF01L] 
-- Can Japan enact economic reforms? Experts say raising
the 5 percent sales tax is key -- a radical idea in a country
where the tax has not been increased for years, but one the
DPJ has openly broached. Still, with his popularity low and
parliamentary power sapped, Kan is unlikely to try to force
the issue. In December, the government ordered a 5 percentage
point cut in the corporate tax rate starting from April 2011,
but analysts doubt the move will boost either Japanese
corporate spending or the popularity of the DPJ.
[ID:nTOE6BF00L] 
-- Australia's mining tax. The government's centrepiece
policy is a proposed new tax regime for the resources firms
that have long been the backbone of the Australian economy.
After taking office in August, Gillard made a deal with miners
Rio Tinto , BHP Billiton and
Xstrata to cut the headline rate of the new tax to 30
percent from 40 percent, but the matter is far from settled.
Final details of the tax are under discussion between the
government and mining firms. Smaller miners are unhappy with
the plan, and a dispute over royalty payments could scuttle
the deal. The government is expected to present the tax law to
parliament in May, and it will be voted upon after June, when
it will depend on Green support in both houses of parliament.
[ID:nSGE6AL03M] 
-- Resistance to Singapore's $7.9 billion takeover bid for
the Australian bourse (ASX), a deal which cannot go through
without Australian political backing. No single owner is
allowed to hold more than 15 percent of ASX, a rule which
would have to be lifted by parliament. Indications are that
the independents and Greens oppose the takeover, and may block
it. If the buyout does go ahead, firms will be concerned that
it may mean changes to listing rules and higher compliance
costs. [ID:nL3E6NE1YB] 

WILL SOUTHEAST ASIA'S SURGING MARKETS RUN OUT OF STEAM? 
Southeast Asia's financial markets were among the world's
best performers in 2010. Indonesia led the pack on growing
expectations that it will be awarded an investment grade
sovereign rating, but the Philippines and Malaysia also posted
impressive gains, and even Thailand staged spectacular stock
market and currency rallies despite the worst political
violence in its modern history in April and May. 
The risk is that these gains unravel in 2011 and that the
plug is pulled on the flood of hot money that has buoyed the
region's markets. Monetary authorities will probably have to
play catch up with other Asian central banks that are further
into a tightening cycle, food prices could easily get out of
hand, foreign participation in the region's markets is already
relatively high and rising U.S. Treasury yields could pull
money out of places like Indonesia and the Philippines. 
Foreign investors have largely turned a blind eye to
Southeast Asian political risk in their hunt for high-yield
assets. If enthusiasm begins to wane, a more glass-half-empty
view of regional politics could spark a significant reversal. 
What to watch: 
-- The biggest political risks are in Thailand, where an
intractable political conflict remains far from resolution.
New general elections must be held by the end of 2011, and
given the country's divisions there is a significant risk of
unrest during campaigning. If the Puea Thai party backed by
fugitive former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra wins enough
electoral support to form a government, a coup or judicial
intervention to overturn the result is almost inevitable --
Thailand's elites remain bitterly opposed to Thaksin and
terrified of political reprisals if a party loyal to him wins
power. If the Democrat Party of the current prime minister,
Abhisit Vejjajiva, manages to win enough seats to form another
coalition, the ""red shirt"" movement demanding change may
resort once more to mass street protests. The risks are
heightened by the poor health of 83-year-old King Bhumibol
Adulyadej. Secret U.S. embassy cables released by WikiLeaks
have underlined concerns the succession to Crown Prince Maha
Vajiralongkorn will be a tense time with high potential for
unrest and upheaval. [ID:nSGE6BG01R] 
-- In Indonesia, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has
disappointed many with his failure to decisively promote
economic reforms and crack down firmly on corruption. For now,
investors see Indonesia's bullish domestic growth story as too
good to miss despite the political risk. But a change in
sentiment could hit Jakarta markets hard. [ID:nL3E6NG09T] 
-- In Malaysia, the opposition is losing ground and that
may embolden Prime Minister Najib Razak to hold early
elections in 2011. But a verdict in the sodomy trial of
opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim may widen divisions.
[ID:nSGE6AE0TW] 
-- Early optimism sparked by the election of Philippine
President Benigno Aquino is fading. He has yet to show he can
challenge entrenched vested interests and crack down on
corruption to tackle the fiscal deficit. [ID:nSGE6AF0GD]

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the dollar,
the yen and the Swiss franc on Tuesday after upbeat euro zone
and U.S. economic data boosted risk appetite, but its gains were
hampered by nagging doubts over euro zone bond issuance.
 The Australian dollar fell as severe floods in north-east
Australia were expected to impact coal production, a major
contributor to its economy.
 The single currency was helped against the dollar by steady
buying from Asian central banks after the euro area purchasing
managers' index (PMI) was revised upwards on Monday from the
earlier flash estimate, indicating a pick up in the region's
growth momentum.
 Comments from a Chinese official, who said on Monday the
country would continue buying Spanish debt. [ID:nLDE702068] also
helped support the euro.
 The single currency was up 0.4 percent from late U.S.
trading on Monday at $1.3404 , but traders reported strong
offers from macro accounts and analysts remained sceptical about
its ability to rally further.
 ""I do not think these gains in the euro can be sustainable
and as volumes start picking up investors will focus on upcoming
heavy bond issuances from the euro zone,"" Geoffrey Yu, currency
strategist at UBS.
 In the next two months an estimated 150-200 billion euros of
government bonds are scheduled be issued by euro zone countries,
some of whom are struggling with rising budget deficits and
higher borrowing costs.
 Data on Monday showed U.S. manufacturing grew at its fastest
clip in seven months in December and construction spending hit a
five-month high in November, helping to fuel a rise in global
equity markets. [ID:nN03175600]
 ""We are returning to normal levels of trading and the key
themes that people are coming back to is structural weakness in
the euro zone and worries about the Chinese economy,"" said
Jeremy Stretch, head of currency strategy at CIBC World Markets.
 The dollar rose 0.6 percent to 82.18 yen  with traders
seeing offers around 82.50 and near-term resistance at the
55-day moving average of 82.60. The euro rose nearly 1 percent
to trade above 110 yen .
 Markets were awaiting minutes of the Federal Open Market
Committee's Dec. 14 meeting later in the session. Focus will
mainly be on U.S jobs data and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's
testimony to the Senate, both due on Friday.
 
 AUSSIE FALLS
 The Australian dollar fell more than 1 percent to $1.0055
, retreating from a 28-year peak around $1.0257 set on
Friday. Massive flooding in north-east Australia fuelled worries
over coal production. Traders said funds sold Aussie for euros,
taking profit on long Aussie positions taken in the run-up to
the end of 2010.
 Against the Swiss franc, the dollar rose 1.2 percent to
0.9452 , off an all-time low just above 0.9300 set on
Friday. The euro was up 1.4 percent against the franc ,
pulling back from last week's record low of 1.2398 francs as
investors reversed some long Swiss franc positions built in
December.
 Sterling also gained broadly as data showed UK manufacturing
activity grew robustly. The pound  rose as far as
$1.5646 , up more than 1 percent on the day.

 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation was higher
than expected in December, exceeding the European Central Bank's
target for the first time in two years, but economists believe
the bank will keep interest rates unchanged well into 2011.
 The European Union's statistics office Eurostat estimated
that prices in the 16 countries that shared the euro currency in
December rose 2.2 percent year-on-year, up from 1.9 percent in
November. 
 It was highest year-on-year rate since October 2008, when it
came in at 3.2 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had
expected inflation of 2.0 percent. The ECB wants to keep price
growth at just below 2 percent.
 Eurostat does not provide a monthly figure or a detailed
breakdown with its estimate, which will come on Jan. 14.
 But economists said the rise in inflation was mainly due to
energy and food price rises. BNP Paribas economist Clemente de
Lucia, said that between December and November oil prices rose
by around 7 euros per barrel, the strongest monthly increase in
more than two years. 
 Year-on-year oil prices were up by more than 18 euros, which
probably boosted energy prices by around 10 percent
year-on-year, de Lucia said.
 ""This commodity-price driven rise in inflation will only
have implications for ECB policy if the central bank were to see
second round effects emerging, in terms of knock-on effects on
other prices or rising inflation expectations,"" said Nick
Kounis, head of macroeconomic research at ABN AMRO bank.
 ""That only seems likely if we were to see a long period of
high inflation, but on the basis of current levels of commodity
prices, we think that inflation will ease back down again during
the course of this year,"" Kounis said.
 In November it was more expensive energy, especially fuels
for transport, heating oil and gas, that was the main driver of
inflation.
 But economists said that excluding price-driving effects of
the tax hikes implemented in many countries, the inflation rate
would have been some tenths lower. 
 Further adjusted for volatile energy prices, the underlying
inflation would be no more than around 1 percent, they said.
 ""There is no need for monetary policy to act, with
underlying inflation still at 1 percent. We continue to expect
the ECB to start hiking rates only in 2012,"" said Christoph
Weil, economist at Commerzbank.
 But other economists said the ECB could raise the costs of
borrowing earlier.
 ""We are predicting inflation of 2 percent in 2011 and that
means that keeping interest rates at historical lows will no
longer look appropriate,"" said Thomas Mayer, Deutsche Bank's
chief economist.
 ""We think that the ECB will have to move interest rates
upwards in the second half of the year. It is the beginning of a
careful normalisation,"" he said.

 LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher on Tuesday
after upbeat U.S. data suggested the world's biggest economy
will accelerate in 2011, helping it hold gains against the yen
and the Australian dollar.
 But the dollar eased against the euro with the single
currency moving higher on steady buying by Asian central banks
and comments from a Chinese official, who said on Monday the
country would continue buying Spanish debt.
 The euro had slipped earlier with some traders citing talk
of euro-selling by investors related to euro zone bond

 SEOUL, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The impact on South Korea's
economy from mounting inflationary pressures in China is ""more
serious than previously expected"", a Bank of Korea board
member told Reuters on Tuesday.	
 ""I have warned of the risk from China's rising inflation
since some three months ago, and it seems to be getting more
serious than previously expected,"" Choi Dosoung, one of the
central bank's six board members, said in an interview.	
 He refused to comment directly on the future direction of
South Korean interest rate policy, but markets have priced in
additional rate increases from as early as next month after
two raises late last year.	
 Choi is considered an anti-inflation hawk, preferring more
aggressive policy tightening if price pressures escalate too
rapidly.	
 China is South Korea's largest source of imports. A
pick-up in inflation there to 28-month highs is posing an
additional headache for policymakers in Seoul who are already
worrying about the impact of rising international prices for
commodities and energy.	
 ""If inflation expectations went up, actual inflation
tended to go up,"" the former finance professor at the
country's top Seoul National University said in his office in
central Seoul.	
 He also said the risk to Asia's fourth-largest economy
from heightened tension with reclusive North Korea after two
major clashes last year had eased markedly.	
 ""Financial markets have quickly restored stability. It is
right to say investors in international financial markets have
not viewed it too seriously,"" he added.	
 Tension across the heavily armed border between the two
Koreas has risen to the highest level in decades after North
Korea's heavy artillery shelling of an island in the South
killed four people in November, including two civilians.
[ID:nNORKOR]	
 Choi also referred to high household debt in South Korea
as a factor that needs to be taken care of, saying debt was
like ""opium"".

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher on Tuesday
after upbeat U.S. data suggested the world's biggest economy
will accelerate in 2011, helping it make smart gains against the
yen and the Australian dollar.
 The euro eased slightly after last week's short-covering
surge, with some traders citing talk of euro-selling by
investors related to euro zone bond redemptions.
 The dollar was up 0.31 percent versus a basket of currencies
at 79.357 while the euro eased around 0.1 percent from late
U.S. trading on Monday to $1.3353. The single currency had
dipped as low as $1.3324 earlier.
 ""We are returning to normal levels of trading and the key
themes that people are coming back to is structural weakness in
the euro zone and worries about the Chinese economy,"" said
Jeremy Stretch, head of currency strategy at CIBC World Markets.
 ""I am constructive on the dollar in the short term as there
is a modicum of stability in the U.S. economy.""
 The greenback perked up after data showed U.S. manufacturing
grew at its fastest clip in seven months in December and
construction spending hit a five-month high in November.
 With growing evidence the U.S. recovery will gather steam
this year, some analysts expect the dollar to gain traction in
the months ahead. The upbeat view helped drive U.S. stocks to
fresh two-year highs on Monday.
 The dollar rose 0.6 percent to 82.20 yen, getting a lift as
traders took aim at stop-loss bids built around that level.
Traders said offers were seen around 82.50 yen with near term
resistance seen at the 55-day moving average of 82.60.
 ""The year-end yen buying move is over and Treasury yields
have not fallen much, which supports the dollar. So now is not
the time for the dollar to fall sharply,"" said Daisuke Karakawa,
market economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank.
 Traders were awaiting minutes of the Federal Open Market
Committee's Dec. 14 meeting later in the session. While they are
unlikely to have a huge impact, the statement following the
meeting highlighted the difficulty in bringing down unemployment
and its constraining impact on household spending.
 Investors will be more focused on U.S jobs data and Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke's testimony to the Senate, both due on
Friday, to decide whether to build more positions in the dollar.
 
 DOLLAR'S BOUNCE
 Analysts say the strength of forthcoming U.S. data will
determine how much quantitative easing is required and if the
bounce in the dollar is durable or not.
 Overall, the dollar seemed likely to stay supported in the
near term, said Todd Elmer, currency strategist with Citi in
Singapore.
 ""If you look at the trend in terms of U.S. data, we have
seen more propensity for the data to surprise on the upside.
There is some risk that that trend continues at least in the
short term,"" Elmer said.
 The Australian dollar fell more than 1 percent to $1.0055,
retreating from a 28-year peak around $1.0257 set on Friday.
Traders said funds were seen selling Aussie for euros, taking
profit on long Aussie positions established in the run-up to the
end of 2010.
 Traders also cited worries about the massive flooding
Australia's northeast, which has severed roads and closed ports,
curtailing production of coal, the country's top export.
 Against the Swiss franc, the dollar rose 0.9 percent to
0.9422, off an all-time low just above 0.9300 set last Friday.
The euro was also up nearly 0.9 percent against the franc,
pulling back from last week's record low of 1.2398 francs.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Optimism about the state of the
world economy lifted stocks on Tuesday and kept oil prices at a
near 27-month peak.
 Wall Street looked set to join in with gains at the open.
The dollar was flat and the euro gained.
 Monday's U.S., Chinese and European PMI manufacturing data
continued to boost risk sentiment across financial markets along
with the ""January effect"" that occurs as fund managers dispense
with the need to settle end-of-year balances.
 Some investors were also looking ahead to Friday's U.S. jobs
data, expecting to see the world's largest economy in an
improving state of health.
 ""People are starting to recognise there is some improvement
in the employment picture in the United States. You would expect
to see some of the confidence of the (manufacturing) PMI to be
reflected in the non-farm payrolls,"" said Philip Isherwood,
European equities strategist at Evolution Securities.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were up 0.4 a percent on
the day for a 1 percent gain in the first two trading days of
the year. Emerging market stocks lagged behind but were up 0.3
percent on the day.
 Europe was a main driver with the FTSEurofirst 300 up 1.3
percent. Part of the gain came from UK stocks catching up after
a holiday on Monday and from energy stocks rising on higher oil
prices.
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei began the year with a 1.7 percent
climb to a 7-1/2 month closing high.
 ""Investors may stay cautious before U.S. jobs data this
Friday, but they are optimistic overall,"" said Hiroichi Nishi,
general manager at Nikko Cordial Securities.
 Recent bullishness about the global economy has pushed up
the price of crude oil, which hovered near its highest levels in
more than two years.
 U.S. crude for February rose 27 cents to $91.82 a barrel,
close to Monday's peak of $92.58, which was the highest intraday
price since early October 2008.
 ""Oil sentiment has turned decidedly bullish, partly driven
by unusually cold weather, but more due to an increasingly
optimistic consensus view on 2011 economic performance,
especially for the U.S.,"" JPMorgan analysts said.
 
 EURO GAINS
 The upbeat U.S. manufacturing data lifted the dollar for a
while but it later fell back while the euro gained around a
third of a percent to $1.3393.
 The single currency had dipped as low as $1.3324 earlier on
Tuesday, with some traders citing talk of possible euro-selling
flows related to bond redemptions and coupon payments of euro
zone debt.
 Bund futures shed early gains as commodities and equities
continued to benefit from broader signs of an improved economic
outlook.

 By Sanjeev Miglani	
 SINGAPORE, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks led Asian
equities higher, climbing to their highest since May, and oil
prices were perched near a 27-month high on Tuesday, with
investors betting the improving U.S. recovery may be reflected
in jobs data later in the week.	
 The dollar also rose while U.S. Treasuries dipped in Asia
as investors kicked off the year turning to riskier assets
such as high-yield credit, on signs that growth in the world's
biggest economy may accelerate in 2011.	
 The big test for the U.S. economy comes later this week
when the government will publish its December jobs report
after a report that manufacturing activity increased in
December at its fastest clip in seven months. U.S. stocks hit
two-year highs overnight, though the March S&P 500 future
 was steady. 
 Japan's Nikkei stock average closed 1.65 percent
higher at its highest level in 7-1/2 months, led by resource
companies, as oil and commodity prices rose on the stronger
economic growth outlook this year. 
 ""Market players are now focusing on the U.S. payrolls data
due on Friday, which will likely have an impact on both Wall
Street shares and the dollar/yen rate,"" said Kazuhiro
Takahashi,
general manager at Daiwa Capital Markets in Tokyo.	
 Stocks are also getting a boost from the ""January effect""
when fund managers are no longer distracted by year-end window
dressing and instead focus on stocks they find attractive,
traders said.	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares excluding Japan
was largely unchanged on the day, just shy of
a 2-1/2-year high hit in November. 
 The Shanghai Composite Index was up 1.4 percent,
supported by a 5 percent jump in property stocks as worries
about further monetary tightening eased after surveys
indicated that Chinese factory inflation may be abating.

 Accelerating inflation and record house prices have led
China's central bank to signal time and again in recent months
that the country needs ""prudent"" monetary policy to curb
price pressures and prevent asset bubbles.	
 But a fall in the official purchasing managers' index in
December over the previous month held out hope that inflation,
running at its highest in over two years, may be peaking soon.	
 ""2011 may witness the start of a new round of the growth
cycle, driven by regional economic development and industry
restructuring,"" said Huatai-PineBridge Fund Management Co fund
manager Qin Lingsong. 
 ""Chinese corporate profits are expected to rise 15-20
percent annually, which lends strong support to current
valuations."" 
 Still, investor Jim Rogers said inflation remained a top
concern for Chinese policymakers.	
 ""But I think they'll be more tightening in China because
the Chinese do have a serious inflation problem..... And
they're determined to kill it,"" he told Reuters Insider TV
[ID:nRTV177015]	
 While the mood was upbeat across much of Asia, shares in
Australia underperformed the region, and both the Australian
and New Zealand dollars were under pressure because of worries
over the impact of floods in northeast Australia.	
 Heavy flooding in Queensland has cut coal exports and
hurt wheat production. Miners such as Rio Tinto have
declared force majeure and cut coal exports to a trickle.	
 ""The lights were flashing a very verdant green at the
start of the session but now it has fizzled. I suspect it will
come back a bit later,"" said Michael Heffernan, strategist at
Austock Group.	
 ""The floods are likely to have some impact on coal stocks.""
The S&P/ASX 200 index was 0.06 percent lower while the
Australian dollar fell to 0.9 percent to US$1.0068.	
 
 DOLLAR GAINS, TREASURIES DECLINE 
 The U.S. dollar was stronger, rising 0.6 percent to 82.20
yen , having bounced from an eight-week low of 80.93 yen
hit on trading platform EBS on Monday. Analysts expect more
traction for the greenback in the months ahead as the recovery
gathers strength.	
 The euro eased slightly after last week's short-covering
surge, with some traders citing talk of euro-selling by
investors related to euro zone bond redemptions. ""There is
lots of talk about German bond redemptions today,"" said a
trader for a European bank in Singapore.	
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were down
5/32 in price to yield 3.35 percent, ahead of a raft of U.S.
data including November factory orders and December vehicle
sales figures later on Tuesday. 
 Sensing hunger among international investors for higher
yield, the Philippines has embarked on a $1.5 billion, 25-year
global peso bond sale. The maturity is longer than the initial
plan to sell bonds of 10 to 20 years maturity and the amount
being raised has been increased, indications that demand for
the paper is high. [ID:nSGE70204G]	
 ""The favourable economic fundamentals will attract foreign
interest. External liquidity indicators are good and should
provide strength to the peso. From those perspectives there
should be adequate interest for the global peso bond,"" said
Joey Cuyegkeng, analyst with ING.	
 Oil  was steady at $91.60, near its highest levels
in more than two years as accelerating manufacturing activity
in the U.S. and frigid winter weather fanned optimism that
U.S. crude inventories will continue to drain.	
 Copper futures opened at a record high in London on
Tuesday after the New Year break, chasing a rally in New York
which touched an all-time high in the previous session.

 * Flood impact on exports weighs on Aussie
 * Euro eases, talk of bond redemption-related flows
 By Ian Chua and Masayuki Kitano
 SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The dollar edged broadly
higher on Tuesday, with the yen on the backfoot after upbeat U.S.
data suggested the world's biggest economy will accelerate in
2011.
 The Australian dollar came under pressure with traders citing
worries about the massive floods in the country's northeast,
which has severed roads and closed ports, curtailing production
of coal, Australia's top export.
 The euro eased slightly after last week's short-covering
surge, with some traders citing talk of euro-selling by investors
related to euro zone bond redemptions.
 Overall, the dollar seems likely to stay supported in the
near term, said Todd Elmer, currency strategist with Citi in
Singapore.
 ""If you look at the trend in terms of U.S. data, we have seen
more propensity for the data to surprise on the upside. There is
some risk that that trend continues at least in the short term,""
Elmer said.
 The euro eased around 0.1 percent from late U.S. trading on
Monday to $1.3353.
 The euro dipped as low as $1.3328 earlier on Tuesday, with
some traders citing talk of possible euro-selling flows related
to bond redemptions and coupon payments of euro zone debt.
 ""There is lots of talk about German bond redemptions today,""
said a trader for a European bank in Singapore.
 The dollar rose 0.5 percent to 82.14 yen, getting a lift as
traders took aim at stop-loss bids around 82.20 yen, traders
said. The greenback has pulled up from an eight-week low of 80.93
yen hit on trading platform EBS on Monday.
 ""The year-end yen buying move is over and Treasury yields
have not fallen much, which supports the dollar. So now is not
the time for the dollar to fall sharply,"" said Daisuke Karakawa,
market economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank.
 ""The market needs to see upcoming U.S. economic events and
data such as employment figures to examine how the U.S. economy
will pan out,"" he said.
 The greenback perked up after data showed U.S. manufacturing
grew at its fastest clip in seven months in December, and
construction spending hit a five-month high in November.
 With mounting evidence the U.S. recovery will gather steam
this year, some analysts expect the dollar to gain some traction
in the months ahead. The upbeat view helped drive U.S. stocks to
fresh two-year highs on Monday.
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance
against a basket of major currencies, edged up 0.2 percent to
79.307.
 The Australian dollar fell 0.7 percent to $1.0096, retreating
from a 28-year peak around $1.0257 set on Friday.
 ""The flood has claimed several lives, while damage to
infrastructure ... will be a hit to export revenues,"" said Sue
Trinh, currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 Some traders said they would not be surprised to see a retest
of parity in the short term.
 Still, while export volumes could be hit in the short term,
that has in turn boosted prices for several commodities including
coal and wheat, lessening the impact on the economy.
 Against the Swiss franc, the dollar rose 0.6 percent to
0.9390, off an all-time low just above 0.9300 set last Friday.

 SINGAPORE, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Asian stocks advanced on
Tuesday and oil hovered near a 27-month high, supported by
U.S. data suggesting a recovery in the world's biggest economy
was gathering momentum. 
 Japanese shares hit a 7-1/2 month high on Tokyo's first
trading session of the New Year, a day after the United States
reported manufacturing grew at its fastest clip in seven
months in December. U.S. stocks hit new two-year highs
overnight.

week when the government will publish its December jobs report.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher against
the euro on Monday, aided by a jump in global stock markets and
rising Treasury yields.
 Thin trading due to holidays in Tokyo and London added to
volatility in the euro, but the dollar was expected to
outperform the single currency as concerns about some euro zone
nations' ability to sell debt top investor worries.
 ""There are plenty of factors that should weigh on the euro
over the near-term while the dollar should continue to benefit
from strong economic data,"" said Mark McCormick, currency
strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 Wall Street stocks surged more than 1 percent as the new
trading year kicked off and the rally of late 2010 resumed on
encouraging signs about the economic outlook and a seasonal
effect. For more, see: [ID:nN03185820].
 U.S. Treasury yields, which move inversely to price, rose,
though investors may wait until after Friday's U.S. jobs data
to bet on yields heading much higher. [ID:nN03185316].
 Rising yields tend to support the dollar as they reflect
stronger growth. They also enhance the attractiveness of some
dollar-denominated assets to investors.
 In late afternoon New York trading, the euro fell to
$1.3365  against the dollar, down 0.09 percent on the
day, but above the session's low of $1.3251, according to
Reuters data.
 Also weighing on the euro were worries about the ability of
certain euro zone countries to sell an abundance of debt.
Portugal is expected to refinance 11 billion euros worth of
debt and Spain 32 billion euros worth in the first quarter,
according to BBH's McCormick.
 ""If we continue to see strong economic data, the euro by
the end of the week should drop to the $1.32 range against the
dollar. But if Friday's payrolls report disappoints, the euro
should reach the $134.50 range against the dollar,"" he said.
 Manufacturing in the United States and Europe accelerated
in December, while growth in China and India slowed to a more
sustainable level, helping to fuel a move by investors into
riskier assets. [ID:nN03178029]
 The data helped the euro outperform some currencies. It
rose 0.64 percent against sterling to 86.27 pence  and
gained 0.45 percent versus the yen to 109.12 yen .
 The dollar rose 0.63 percent against the yen to 81.66 yen
.
 The dollar was down 0.05 percent against the Swiss franc to
0.9330 francs , after dropping to an all-time low of
0.9301 on Friday. The euro was down 0.16 percent against the
Swiss franc at 1.2468 francs , still some distance
away from its record low at 1.2398 francs hit last week.
 Greg Anderson, senior currency strategist at CitiFX in New
York, said markets are ""expecting further U.S. economic
outperformance in the first quarter,"" which would be
dollar-positive.
 He also expects further losses in the euro starting this
week ""until the market is satisfied with the outcomes for
Portugal and Spain.""
 Anderson added that the currency market will more or less
have the same theme as last year, ""with the euro being sold off
because of the euro zone debt crisis.""
 The euro ended 2010 around 6.5 percent lower against the
dollar, its biggest annual drop since 2005, weighed down by the
debt crisis that hit Greece and Ireland.
 The euro zone currency climbed last week, hitting roughly
three-week highs versus the dollar, as bears gave up their
positions, frustrated by the currency's firm support at its
200-day moving average just below $1.31.
 Some traders said the euro gained some ground as European
equities rose <.FTEU3> after earlier euro selling by macro
funds. 
 ""Without an upside surprise in the (U.S.) job data this
week, dollar/yen is likely to come under renewed pressure,""
analysts at BNP Paribas said in a note.

 NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The dollar gained slightly
against the euro on Monday as global stocks rallied, and was
expected to outperform the single European currency given
concerns about some euro zone nations' ability to sell debt.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The euro rallied broadly but
was slightly lower against the dollar on Monday as U.S stocks
rose, though gains were likely temporary given doubts about the
ability of euro zone members to tap bond markets.
 Traders said the euro found bids around the $1.3305 area.
 Thinned trading due to holidays in Tokyo and London added
to volatility in the euro, which now trades as a 17-country
unit after Estonia gained full membership on Jan 1.
 ""Arguably, there's increased risk appetite with U.S. stocks
up. I think that is having a positive impact on the euro, which
can be positively correlated with equities,"" said Nick
Bennenbroek, head of FX strategy at Wells Fargo in New York.
 Declining U.S. bond yields have also weighed on the U.S.
dollar, Bennenbroek added, indirectly benefiting the euro.
Benchmark 10-year yields hit a high of 3.4395 on Monday, but
slipped to 3.3362 by midday.
 Rising yields tend to support the greenback as they reflect
stronger growth. They also enhance the attractiveness of some
dollar-denominated assets to investors.
 Many analysts though see continued strength in the dollar
and further downside for the euro.
 Greg Anderson, senior currency strategist, at CitiFX in New
York, said markets are ""expecting further U.S. economic
outperformance in the first quarter"" which is dollar-positive.

 The single euro zone currency, however, climbed last week,
hitting roughly three-week highs versus the dollar, as bears
gave up their positions, frustrated by the currency's firm
support at its 200-day moving average just below $1.31. Gains
accelerated on Friday after stop-loss bids were triggered.
 In midday New York trading the euro rose 0.8 percent
against sterling to 86.35 pence and gained 0.4 percent versus
the yen to 109.06 yen.
 The euro hit a high of $1.3396, after reaching session lows
around $1.3250. It last traded at $1.3373, little changed on
the day.
 Bids below $1.33 supported the pair, while offers were seen
above $1.3350, keeping the upside limited, traders said.
 Some traders said the euro gained some ground as European
equities rose after earlier euro selling by macro funds.
 The dollar rose 0.5 percent against the yen to 81.53 yen,
having touched an eight-week low of 80.93 yen on trading

 NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S. and European stocks
resumed their rally in the first trading session of 2011 on
Monday on stronger global manufacturing data, while oil rose as
the outlook for growth increased optimism about demand.
 U.S. Treasuries prices fell as the data -- including a
pickup in U.S. manufacturing growth last month -- suggested the
economic recovery continues to gain momentum, encouraging
investors to take on more risk.
 The Institute for Supply Management said U.S. manufacturing
grew for a 17th straight month following news of faster growth
in European manufacturing as well. For details, see

 In another recent positive report, China's factory
inflation slowed in December, removing some pressure from the
Chinese central bank to slow down the economy.

 The three main U.S. stock indexes jumped more than 1
percent on Monday following the data.
 ""There is a lot of money in cash, a lot of money in bonds
that would like out of bonds. It's only natural, with the
economic improvement, it's finding its way to equities,"" said
Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Morgan in San
Francisco.
 The big test for the U.S. economy lies on Friday when the
government will publish its widely watched nonfarm payrolls
report.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> jumped 124.19
points, or 1.07 percent, to 11,701.70, while the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose 16.98 points, or 1.35 percent, to
1,274.62. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> gained 49.31
points, or 1.86 percent, to 2,702.18.
 In Europe, the the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top
stocks unofficially closed 0.9 percent higher at 1,131.59 on a
broad rally, led by construction and industrial shares. Trading
was thin, with markets closed in Britain and parts of Asia.
 The MSCI All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.9
percent, after finishing 2010 with gains of 10 percent, back to
its strongest level since September 2008.
 Emerging market stocks jumped 1.3 percent, according to
another MSCI index <.MSCIEF>.
 Oil extended its rally on optimism the global economic
recovery was gaining momentum. U.S. crude futures  rose
0.8 percent to $92.11 a barrel.
 EURO STARTS LOWER
 Worries about the euro-zone debt crisis weighed on the
euro.
 The euro started the first trading day of 2011 lower and
analysts said it is likely to extend its downtrend as investors
avoid the single currency due to nagging concerns about the
euro-zone debt crisis.
 ""The euro is trading with a heavier tone. I think traders
are trying to cut back their exposure on the euro as volumes
normalize and given continued problems in the euro zone,"" said
Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange in Washington.
 The euro  was down 0.12 percent at $1.3361 from a
previous session close of $1.3377, after hitting a session low
around $1.3251.
 The dollar rose 0.15 percent against a basket of major
currencies, according to the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>. Against
the Japanese yen, the dollar  was up 0.63 percent at
81.66.
 Also supporting dollar gains was a rise in U.S. Treasury
yields resulting from investors' renewed appetite for risk.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 22/32 in price, sending its yield up to 3.3712 percent.
 Gold prices held steady.

 By Samantha Pearson and Michael O'Boyle
 SAO PAULO/MEXICO CITY, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Latin American
currencies firmed on Monday after strong manufacturing data
around the world boosted the region's riskier assets.
 The U.S. manufacturing sector grew for a 17th straight
month in December and factory orders surged in the euro zone,
separate data showed on Monday. For details, see
[ID:nN03173040] and [ID:nSLAVNE6L8].
 Meanwhile, cooling Chinese factory inflation relieved
worries about moves to slow growth in Brazil's biggest trading
partner. [ID:nSGE70204P]
 Asian countries, especially China, have been gobbling up
Latin American commodities such as Brazilian soybeans and
Chilean copper, driving economic growth.
 The Chilean peso  firmed 0.39 percent to 465.90 per
dollar, hitting its strongest level since May 2008.
 The Mexican currency  strengthened 0.55 percent to
12.298 per dollar, flirting with a six-week high.
 ""The general outlook is positive. Right now, the market is
100 percent focused on the economic data and the question of
Europe's fiscal deficits has been put aside, which is the only
thing that could knock markets down now,"" said Emilio Diez De
Sollano, an analyst at brokerage Monex in Mexico City.
 ""There is optimism that the expansion of the manufacturing
sector will continue. This implies that consumption, even if it
is moderate and is still weak, is on the right path.""
 REAL JUMPS ON DILMA'S FIRST DAY
 The Brazilian real  was bid 0.84 percent stronger at
1.650 reais per U.S. dollar on the local spot market on Monday
-- the first day of President Dilma Rousseff's government.
 Rousseff has promised to build on an unprecedented run of
economic success achieved by her popular predecessor and
mentor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. [ID:nN03171994]
 The real gained 4.6 percent in 2010, underperforming most
Latin American currencies.
 After sharp gains during most of the past decade, the real
may not offer as much value as other currencies in the region,
according to some analysts. Investors have also been put off by
authorities' efforts to curb the currency's gains via dollar
purchases, tax increases and frequent verbal warnings.
 However, the expectation of higher interest rates in Brazil
this year should continue to support the real, said Reginaldo
Galhardo, head of currency trading at the Treviso brokerage in
Sao Paulo.
 ""It's not even that people are betting the real will
strengthen, but the trend for higher interest rates will always
favor the currency.""

 NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against the
dollar on Monday in the first trading session of 2011 and may
likely extend its downtrend, as traders pared back their
exposure to the euro on nagging concerns about euro zone debt.
 Thinned trade due to holidays in Tokyo and London added to
volatility in the euro/dollar pair, which reversed year-end
gains.
 ""The euro is trading with a heavier tone. I think traders
are trying to cut back their exposure on the euro as volumes
normalize and given continued problems in the euro zone,"" said
Omer Esiner, chief market analyst, at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange in Washington.
 The euro ended the 2010 around 6.5 percent lower against
the dollar, its biggest annual drop since 2005, weighed down by
a debt crisis that hit Greece and Ireland.
 The single euro zone currency, however, had climbed last
week, hitting roughly three-week highs versus the dollar, as
bears gave up their positions, frustrated by the currency's
firm support at its 200-day moving average just below $1.31.
Gains accelerated on Friday after stop-loss bids were
triggered.
 In early New York trading, the euro traded at $1.3339,
having hit a session low around $1.3251, and down 0.3 percent
from around $1.3377 in late U.S. trade on Friday.
 Bids below $1.33 supported the pair, while offers were seen
above $1.3350, keeping the upside limited, traders said.
 Some traders said the euro gained some ground as European
equities rose after earlier euro selling by macro funds.
 Still many analysts see further downside for the euro.
 ""We expect the euro to trade below $1.30 for most of the
first quarter,"" said Roberto Mialich, currency strategist at
Unicredit in Milan, adding peripheral euro zone debt issuances
in the early part of the year could be a catalyst for the
shared currency to fall.
 The dollar edged up 0.5 percent against the yen to 81.59
yen, having touched an eight-week low of 80.93 yen on trading
platform EBS earlier on Monday.
 ""Without an upside surprise in the (U.S.) job data this
week, dollar/yen is likely to come under renewed pressure,""
analysts at BNP Paribas said in a note.
 U.S. nonfarm payrolls due out on Friday are seen rising
126,000 in December, a Reuters poll showed. U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's congressional testimony
scheduled for Friday will also be closely watched.
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent against the Swiss franc to
0.9361 francs, after dropping to an all-time low of 0.9301 on
Friday.
 The euro was flat against the Swiss franc at 1.2488 francs,
still some distance away from its record low at 1.2398 francs
hit last week.

 By Wojciech Moskwa and Camilla Knudsen
 OSLO, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Norway's central bank will keep its
focus on inflation and its policy pattern steady, new Governor
Oeystein Olsen said on Monday as the Norwegian crown hit highs
and property price growth was forecast to accelerate in 2011.
 Olsen takes over Norges Bank with policy delicately poised.
On the one hand the strong crown is restraining inflation and
easing pressure for rises in interest rates, while on the other
the economy gains speed and housing prices bubble higher.
 Add to the mix uncertainty over the broader European
economy, where 60 percent of Norway's exports go, and the global
impact of a flood of cheap capital from the United States, and
Olsen's honeymoon as governor could be short.
 ""Imbalances and problems in the international economy mean
that the Bank can expect fresh challenges ahead in many of its
primary areas,"" Olsen said on Monday, his first day on the job.
 Norwegian industry is concerned that hot money flows could
further strengthen the crown and price it out of export markets,
especially as official projections show Norway raising its main
rate from the current 2.0 percent around mid-2011.
 The crown on Monday rose to its highest level against the
euro since last May and is up 6 percent since October, helped by
strong energy export prices as well as the expectations of
higher official rates.
 Scandinavia's other free-moving currency, the Swedish crown
, hit a six-year high against the euro on Monday. Its central
bank governor said in minutes published separately that it could
not let the currency drive policy.
 ""I have no view on whether the Norwegian crown is on the
strong side or on the other side,"" Olsen said in an interview
with Reuters Insider television. ""We have one target and one
goal -- to secure low and stable inflation."" 
 Asked about his view on forex market interventions, he said:
""Norges Bank does not make currency interventions.""
 
 DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
 Olsen pointed to the policy challenge the bank would face if
Norway's growth significantly exceeded that of a crisis-hit euro
zone. Analysts say that could mean the bank might have to raise
rates by more than planned, risking more gains for the crown.
 ""These different developments must be balanced in economic
policies and monetary policy in particular,"" Olsen said, but
would not be drawn out on whether he would oppose a further
widening of the rates spread between Norway and the euro zone.
 Finance Minister Sigbjoern Johnsen told Reuters last month
that Norway should keep a low rate differential with the euro
zone, whose main rate stands at 1.0 percent.
 Core inflation was also at 1.0 percent in November, compared
to the bank's 2.5 percent target, but industry data on Monday
showed housing prices rose 6.7 year-on-year in December and were
expected to rose 8 percent in 2011.
 Olsen was previously the head of a statistical agency that
has been more bullish on Norway's growth prospects than the
central bank, signalling that rates could be raised sooner than
Norges Bank's previous forecasts. But Olsen played down any
policy impact of his arrival at the helm of the bank.
 ""Today... my main message is that our system of flexible
inflation targeting is well anchored and it's going t be
continued,"" Olsen said, adding that inflation-targeted monetary
policy had helped stabilise Norway's highly cyclical economy.
 ""It can be assumed that the bank's policy response pattern
will continue,"" Olsen said in a statement.
 Asked if the central bank's economic outlook will change,
Olsen said: ""No, not at all. It is necessary to continue the
robust and necessary work done by the bank's employees and the
previous governor.""
 ""I also stress for those that follow monetary policy
particularly closely, you should assume that the reaction
pattern of Norges Bank -- given the inflation target -- is
recognised and is going to be continued.""

 By Nigel Stephenson
 LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - European shares rose on Monday in
the first trading session of 2011, led by German automaker
Porsche, while the euro fell against the dollar on concerns the
euro zone sovereign debt crisis could resurface soon.
 German government bond futures rose but pared earlier gains
as stocks bounced and after stronger-than-expected euro zone
manufacturing data.
 Gold prices held steady while oil extended its rally above
$92 a barrel on optimism the global economic recovery was
gaining momentum. U.S. Treasuries prices fell sharply,
anticipating stronger U.S. data would support rising yields. 
 U.S. stock index futures   pointed to a higher
open on Wall Street.
 ""Sentiment is positive and that is mainly because of the
seasonality. Money managers typically get some new inflows at
the start of a year and they put them to work,"" said Philippe
Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets.
 With markets in Britain and parts of Asia closed, trade was
very thin.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top European stocks
was 1.17 percent higher at 1,134.84. Porsche  rose
nearly 15 percent after a U.S. judge dismissed a lawsuit by
hedge funds seeking more than $2 billion in damages.
 Analysts said equity markets were expected to remain
volatile in 2011 as issues including the euro zone debt crisis
resurfaced.
 ""A lot of the positive news has been priced into equities
and the first half is going to be a bumpy ride for the equity
market,"" a Germany-based equity strategist said.
 The euro dipped against the dollar, with traders and
analysts warning that the euro zone debt crisis, and the year's
first sovereign debt auctions in the bloc, could weigh on the
single currency.
 ""Bond market spreads could be a bit of a burden for the
euro,"" said Lutz Karpowitz, senior currency strategist at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 He added, however, that data from the U.S. Institute for
Supply Management, due later on Monday, could support the
dollar. The ISM's December non-manufacturing data index is
forecast to rise to 56.9 from 56.6 in November.
 The euro  was last at $1.3315, down 0.4 percent, but
off its lows after higher European shares boosted sentiment. The
dollar index <.DXY>, which measures the greenback against a
basket of currencies, was up 0.4 percent.

 LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the dollar
on Monday in the first trading session of 2011, reversing
year-end gains on persisting concerns about euro zone debt.
 Thinned trade due to holidays in Tokyo and London added to
volatility.

 * Safe-haven franc hitting new records
 
 ZURICH, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Activity in Switzerland's
manufacturing sector slowed slightly more than expected in
December, although still growing at a robust pace, as the strong
Swiss franc weighed on the export-dominated economy.
 The Swiss purchasing managers' index fell to a seasonally
adjusted 59.6 points in December from 61.8 points in the
previous month and compared with a median forecast in a Reuters
poll for 61 points, data showed on Monday.
 The index is compiled by the Swiss SVME purchasing managers'
association and Credit Suisse, which noted the index had been
hovering around 60 points since August, well above the growth
threshold of 50 points but below highs of early 2010.
 ""With the exception of output, all of the subcomponents that
feed into the calculation of the PMI lost ground compared with
the previous month,"" they said. ""Those subcomponents which point
more towards future trends slipped back within the growth zone.""
 Last week, a smaller-than-expected dip in the leading KOF
economic barometer in December indicated the brisk recovery of
the Swiss economy looks set to slow only slightly in the first
half of 2011 despite the soaring Swiss franc.
 ""The Swiss purchasing managers' index fell unexpectedly in
December. The Swiss economy, however, is still poised for
growth,"" said VP Bank economist Joerg Zeuner.
 ""The only sore point is the strong Swiss franc which is
climbing from record high to record high versus the euro and the
dollar. If this development continues, the export and tourism
industries will come to feel it more during the course of the
year and this will impact total economic growth negatively.""
 The Swiss National Bank, which expects the economy to grow
by some 1.5 percent in 2011, said after it kept rates on hold
last month the soaring Swiss franc was set to hit exports and
lead to a ""significant"" overall slowdown.
 The safe-haven franc has hit new record highs against the
euro and the dollar in recent days and business leaders such as
the head of watchmaker Swatch Group have voiced concern over the
currency's strength.

 By Tony Munroe and Andy Bruce
 LONDON/MUMBAI, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Factory output growth eased
only slightly in Asia in December and offered an upbeat end to a
fraught 2010 for the euro zone, with signs that growth in export
orders was filtering through to the region's periphery.
 Surging new orders and a fast-improving labour market helped
quicken the expansion of the single currency area's
manufacturing sector for the fourth month running, purchasing
managers' indexes showed on Monday.
 In fast-growing China and India, manufacturing expanded
robustly though at a slower pace than previously, easing some
concerns about possible overheating in Asia.. South Korea's
factories posted their biggest surge in seven months.
 Powerhouses Germany and France continued to lead the
16-nation single currency zone's industrial recovery.
 But output also grew faster in much of the area's periphery
-- where debt concerns continued to drive financial markets on
the first trading day of 2011 -- as export orders revived
following steady declines in the value of the euro.
 ""Germany remained the star performer, seeing near-record
growth, followed by France, where the PMI slipped only slightly
from November's ten-year peak,"" said Chris Williamson, chief
economist of index compiler Markit.
 ""However, (there were) welcome signs ... in the periphery,
where export sales helped boost output growth in all cases
except Greece, where the rate of decline at least moderated.""
 The U.S. purchasing managers' index (PMI) due to be released
later is forecast to rise slightly to 56.9 in December from 56.6
the previous month, which would provide further evidence that
the country's recovery is gaining traction, leaving Japan and
the euro zone as the global economy's prime laggards.
 Europe's holiday-thinned markets showed little reaction to
the PMI data. With investors bracing for a heavy quarter of euro
zone debt issuance, safe-haven German government bonds rose
while the euro resumed its slide against the dollar.
 ""There's the question of whether things are going to blow up
again with everyone having so much issuance to do and that will
lead to more stresses on the periphery,"" a London-based
fixed-income trader said.
 
 EURO EXPORT BOUNCE
 The Markit Eurozone PMI, which records manufacturing
activity across all the major euro area economies, rose to 57.1
in December, revised higher from a preliminary reading of 56.8
and up from 55.3 in November and nearing April's 46-month high.
 In Germany, manufacturers boosted their workforces at the
fastest rate in at least 14 years and the headline index rose to
a revised 60.7, its highest level since July.
 Ireland's PMI hit its highest level since May and Spain's
index rose off the back of its strongest monthly surge in
foreign orders in over a decade, though factory output in
recession-mired Greece remained in the doldrums.
 The growth outlook for Europe remains modest, with cuts in
public finances expected to weigh for years. Analysts polled by
Reuters last month expected quarter-on-quarter growth in the
euro zone to peak at 0.5 percent over the next two years.
 Emerging economies have bounced back far faster from he
global crisis, but they are also grappling with inflationary
pressure driven by higher food and fuel prices and an strong
influx of funds from investors.
 Indonesian consumer prices rose nearly 7 percent on the year
in December, highlighting the risk that Asia's growth may come
at the cost of tighter monetary policy.
 In China, the official PMI edged down to 53.9 from
November's 55.2, data on New Year's Day showed. That eased
worries about overheating in an economy that saw inflation reach
a 28-month high in November. In India the HSBC Markit PMI
remained high at 56.7, albeit down from November's six-month
high of 58.4.
 ""Perhaps we are seeing early signs the policy tightening in
China and India is having some effect on domestic activities,
while the pick-up in the U.S. and Germany and Europe is
benefiting smaller exporting countries,"" said Robert
Prior-Wandesforde, economist at Credit Suisse in Singapore. 
 Japan's manufacturing activity contracted for the fourth
straight month though index rose to 48.3 from November's 47.3,
showing the contraction had at least eased, data last week
showed.

953,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2011 03:20AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Philippines hires banks for global peso bond issue," * Six banks on shortlist for global peso bond - source	
 * Investor demand expected to be strong - govt	
 * Follow-up to maiden global peso bond in September	
 
 MANILA, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The Philippines has hired banks
to sell global peso bonds with maturities of up to 25 years,
part of the government's strategy to lengthen maturities and
cut its foreign exchange exposure, Finance Secretary Cesar
Purisima said on Monday.	
 He said the government expects investor demand to be
strong given the market appetite for emerging market assets.	
 The size and timing of the issue had not been finalized,
he said. Last week, a source said the central bank had given
approval to issue up to $1.5 billion of the bonds. 
 ""The government will be opportunistic in timing its
borrowing,"" Purisima told reporters.	
 Purisima did not identify the banks hired for the debt
sale, but a source with knowledge of the borrowing plan said
six banks had been shortlisted: Citigroup , HSBC
, Credit Suisse , Deutsche Bank  JP
Morgan and UBS .	
 In September, the country sold $1 billion of global peso
bonds in Asia's first global local-currency debt issue. That
offer attracted more than $13 billion of bids. [ID:nNSGE6880L]	
 Citigroup, HSBC, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and JP
Morgan were all involved in the September issue.	
 Capitalising on investor interest in fast growing emerging
markets, officials have been looking to issue more
peso-denominated debt to cut foreign exchange exposure, and
also to lengthen the maturity profile by issuing longer-dated
bonds, including through swaps of existing debt. [ID:nSGE6BD03X]	
 ""We will continue to reduce foreign currency debt and
continue to lengthen maturity. Any transaction that will bring
us closer to that goal, we will do,"" Purisima said.	
 The Philippines is Asia's most frequent sovereign debt
issuer in the global bond market, and usually makes an issue
in January.

955,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2011 03:04AM ET</span>",Turkish Dec factory PMI holds firm at highest since May," ISTANBUL, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Turkey's manufacturing sector
sustained its strong monthly growth rate in December, continuing
to expand at its fastest level since May, although new orders
waned slightly and input prices spiked.
 The HSBC Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for Turkey was
steady at 56.4 points in December from the previous month,
Economic data firm Markit reported, with 50 points marking the
threshold between expansion and contraction.
 The Input price index rose sharply to 75.1 points from 69.0
in November, the highest rate since April, signalling inflation
could be mounting, despite assurances by the central bank that
inflation is on a downward course.
 ""The pace of output and new order growth moderated slightly
from the previous month, though still remained impressive. New
export orders, on the other hand, showed the fastest improvement
since October 2009,"" said Murat Ulgan, chief economist at HSBC
Turkey.
 ""This stellar performance led to some price and margin
pressures. Input prices soared at a very high rate... whilst
suppliers' delivery times lengthened at a close to record rate.
As such, manufacturers continued to reflect this in output
prices that rose at the fastest pace in eight months.""
 Economists expect Turkey to grow between 7-8 percent this
year in one of the fastest recoveries from the financial crisis
anywhere in the world.
 While the pace of growth has moderated slightly in the
second-half of the year, industrial output figures have remained
surprisingly strong. Production rose 9.8 percent in October,
well above forecast.
 The central bank in December, in a surprise change of
policy, cut its key policy rate by 50 basis points to 6.5
percent, in order to make yields less attractive to portfolio
investors. It also raised required reserve ratios in order to
mitigate credit growth and prevent overheating.
 Some fear the bank may not have done enough to offset its
rate cut with inflation rising as a result.

trading platform EBS earlier on Monday.
 * A drop below 80.21 yen would take the dollar to its
lowest against the yen in nearly 16 years, and a drop below
79.75 yen hit in April 1995 would take the dollar to a

(Recasts with Rousseff taking office)
 By Raymond Colitt
 BRASILIA, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Dilma Rousseff became Brazil's
first female president on Saturday after promising to build on
an unprecedented run of economic success achieved by her
popular predecessor and mentor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
 Thousands of admirers braved a driving rain and cheered as
Rousseff rode to her inauguration in a 1953 Rolls Royce flanked
by an all-female security detail.
 The former Marxist guerrilla, who evolved over the years
into a pragmatic civil servant with a professed obsession for
reducing poverty, smiled broadly and clapped along with
spectators as she was sworn in before the Congress.
 ""Many things have improved in Brazil, but this is just the
beginning of a new era,"" Rousseff, wearing an all-white suit,
told Congress. ""My promise is ... to honor women, to protect
the most fragile, and to govern for all.""
 Rousseff, 63, inherits a booming economy that would make
most of the rest of the world green with envy.
 More than 20 million Brazilians were lifted out of poverty
during Lula's eight years in office, thanks largely to his
social welfare policies and stable economic management that
made Brazil a darling among Wall Street investors.
 The coming decade also looks bright, with massive, newly
discovered offshore oil reserves due to be exploited and the
World Cup and Olympics to be hosted here.
 Yet Rousseff also faces a long list of daunting challenges
that Lula failed to tackle, including an overvalued currency
that is hurting industry, rampant public spending that is
fueling inflation, and notorious bureaucracy that stifles
investment and discourages innovation.
 Perhaps the biggest task will be living up to the example
set by Lula, a former metalworkers' union leader who leaves
office with an approval rating of 87 percent and near folk-hero
status -- especially among the poor.
 ""I'm here to thank Lula for all he's done. If Dilma can do
half of that I'll be happy,"" said Izabel Rosales Figuereido,
who traveled from the western state of Mato Grosso do Sul to
attend Rousseff's inauguration.
 Lula essentially hand-picked Rousseff, his former chief of
staff, to be his successor. The career civil servant had never
run for office before, and she remains a somewhat of a mystery
to many Brazilians, but her promise to continue Lula's policies
was enough to get her elected in October by a wide margin.
 AN UNLIKELY RISE TO POWER
 Rousseff now leads a country that, just four decades ago,
persecuted her as an enemy of the state.
 The daughter of a Bulgarian immigrant, Rousseff was active
in the resistance to Brazil's 1964-85 dictatorship. She was
jailed on subversion charges for three years and tortured by
her military captors. Several of her former cellmates were
present for her inauguration on Saturday.
 After democracy returned, Rousseff held a series of
mid-level government jobs and acquired a reputation as a shrewd
technocrat who is unafraid to call out underlings for shoddy
work or incompetence, but often lacks a common touch when
dealing with voters.
 More recently, she overcame lymphoma in 2009 and she
briefly wore a wig as she underwent chemotherapy. Her doctors
have given her a clean bill of health.
 Rousseff, who appointed an experienced and respected
economic team, pledged to maintain the mostly market-friendly
policies that helped cement Brazil's place among the elite BRIC
group of fast-growing emerging economies that also includes
Russia, India, China and now South Africa.
 In her inaugural speech, Rousseff called for reform of
Brazil's onerous and complex tax system and signaled she
intends to make that a top priority.
 However, Lula also attempted several tax reforms with only
limited success and pushing the changes through her 10-party
coalition in Congress will be easier said than done.
 ""The question is whether she has the courage and support to
stand up to vested interests,"" said Pedro Simon, senator for
the PMDB, the largest party in Rousseff's coalition. ""There's
already an army of scoundrels wanting the victory spoiled.""
 Given the many pressing demands at home, she is likely to
take a lower international profile and avoid courting
controversy, like Lula did when he angered Washington with
mediation efforts over Iran's nuclear program.

983,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2011 05:04AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-The five key issues facing the ECB in 2011," FRANKFURT, Jan 1 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank
faces another crucial year in 2011. Below are the five key
issues facing the bank as it tries to steer the euro zone out
of the ongoing debt crisis.
 TROUBLE IN THE EMPIRE
 The turmoil suffered by Greece, Ireland and Portugal has
highlighted the difficulties the financial crisis has pushed
some euro zone countries into and the inherent fault lines that
exist within the currency union.
 Were the troubles to escalate and spread to Spain or even
Italy, they would begin to raise serious doubts about the
future of the euro and could push the ECB to take previously
unthinkable action.
 COMMENTS
 Intesa Sanpaolo economist Paolo Mameli:
 ""The fate of the European Union seems to depend critically
on Spain.""
 ""An ""effective"" speculative attack on Spain would be a
different matter (to Portugal), as the funds currently planned
for the European Financial Stability Facility would be barely
sufficient for a bail-out; it therefore seems that Spain
represents a sort of Maginot Line for European monetary union.
 ""The only scenario in which the ECB would be willing to
cross the Rubicon (i.e. make massive (government bond)
purchases and not sterilise them) would be the extreme case in
which the contagion affected not just 'minor' sovereign markets
like Greece, Ireland and Portugal, but also the debt of a major
economy like Spain
 ""But this is an extreme scenario (the nuclear option to
'save' Monetary Union) and one which not just the ECB but other
European institutions too would do everything in their power to
avoid.""
 WITHDRAWAL OF CRISIS SUPPORT MEASURES
 The ongoing debt and financial market turbulence forced the
ECB to abandon its plans to reduce the support it offers to
banks at the end of last year.
 Its controversial government bond purchase programme is
also ongoing despite heavy resistance in some quarters of the
central bank.
 With government debt fears still topping the agenda and
question marks hanging over the strength of the euro zone's
economic recovery and some of its banks, the speed at which the
ECB will be able to drop its remaining support -- including
providing banks with limit-free funding -- is seen as another
of the year's major issues.
 COMMENTS
 JP Morgan economists Greg Fuzesi and Nicola Mai:
 ""As in 2010, the ECB in 2011 will again feel no pressure
from the inflation and growth outlook to add additional
monetary stimulus to the economy. Hence, large-scale asset
purchases will remain off the agenda. And while it will remain
generous with its liquidity provision at first, it will be
eyeing the exit from the remaining nonstandard measures.""
 ING economist Martin Van Vliet:
 ""The ECB could well end up staying as the lender and
investor of last resort... The end game is turmoil in the bond
and currency markets.""
 DIVERGING ECONOMIES
 While the euro zone's largest economy, Germany, continues
to power forward, countries in the midst of deficit-cutting
drives such as Ireland, Greece and Portugal face the grey
prospect of recession or extremely feeble growth.
 The split has created a three-speed euro zone and the
prospect that the weaker, debt-strained economies will continue
to arc away from the likes of Germany. It leaves the ECB facing
the impossible task of trying to pitch policy that is right for
all.
 COMMENTS
 ING economist Martin Van Vliet:
 ""If the divergence and the gap between the North and South
of the euro zone continues to widen, it makes it even harder
for one size-fits-all approach to monetary policy.
 ""One of the concerns on the minds of Axel Weber and Juergen
Stark is that the German economy does not need as loose a
monetary policy as the rest of the euro zone.
 ""It's a bit of a Goldilocks situation for the ECB.
Monetary policy is going to either be too hot or too cold. The
problem is it may not be able to be just right at the moment.""
 Ernst & Young Eurozone Forecast economist Marie Diron:
 ""Germany is driving the Eurozone economic recovery with GDP
growth of 3.5 percent forecast this year and 2.1 percent next
... Countries closely linked to the German economy, in
particular Slovakia and Austria, are also predicted to grow
steadily in 2011. More modest growth is forecast in other major
'Northern' countries, including France and Netherlands (both
1.8 percent).
 ""Growth in the peripheral countries in 2011 ... ranges from
-3.3 percent in Greece to -0.7 percent in Portugal. This could
be considerably lower if the peripheral economies face renewed
turmoil in bond markets and need to implement yet additional
deficit tightening measures.""
 RATE HIKES ON THE HORIZON
 According to the latest Reuters poll, economists currently
see the ECB raising euro zone interest rates in the final
quarter of the year. [POLL/ECB] However, the exact timing will
depend on how the euro zone's recovery progresses and whether
recent stronger-than-expected inflation in countries such as
Germany evolves into anything more threatening.
 COMMENTS
 JP Morgan economists Greg Fuzesi and Nicola Mai:
 ""We expect the main policy interest rate to remain at 1
percent during 2011. But, our conviction is not very high on
this call as it is conditional on core inflation falling back
slightly during the year. And it assumes that the
ECB will not become too concerned about potential distortions
arising from the very low level of interest rates.""
 Ernst & Young Eurozone Forecast economist Marie Diron:
 ""The robust growth results of the first part of 2010 may
have encouraged the ECB to believe that the recovery was well
engaged and that the Eurozone could support tighter monetary
conditions. However, the Irish crisis has highlighted the
fragility of the Eurozone economy and the need for monetary
policymakers to use all weapons available to buffer the
negative impacts.""
 LEADERSHIP RACE
 Jean-Claude Trichet's term as ECB President runs out at the
end of October. Germany's Axel Weber and Italy's Mario Draghi
remain front-runners to be his replacement, although Weber's
outspoken views about the ECB's government bond purchases in
recent months appear to have downgraded him from the tag of
clear favourite.
 Whoever gets the nod from euro zone politicians will take
over at crucial juncture for the ECB as it tries to get the
economy and its monetary policy back on a more even keel. The
individual's policy bias will also shape market expectations
about how the ECB will approach interest rate setting and the
level of other support it is likely to provide going forward.
 COMMENTS
 ING economist Martin Van Vliet:
 ""It will get tricky when Trichet steps down at the end of
October. If a German such as Weber picks up the baton the risks
would be higher than if Draghi or (ECB governing council member
Nout) Wellink took the job.
 ""Weber has made it clear he is uncomfortable with some of
what the ECB is doing.
 ""If a hawk followed Trichet it would not necessarily be
good news for the suffering periphery countries.""

 * Brushes off euro crisis, sees benefits from entry
 * Bigger eastern European states more cautious

(Adds PM quote, Krugman, background)
 By David Mardiste
 TALLINN, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Estonia joined the euro zone as
its newest member on Saturday, but the currency club's deepening
crisis is likely to put off bigger eastern European entrants
from joining for up to a decade.
 The small Baltic state of 1.3 million became the 17th euro
zone country at midnight, beginning a switch from the kroon, and
was the first former Soviet state to adopt the euro.
 Prime Minister Andrus Ansip was the first to take euros out
of a specially installed cash machine outside a theatre where a
ball had been held to celebrate the switchover and the new year.
 ""It is a small step for the euro zone and a big step for
Estonia,"" he said, holding the notes.
 ""We are proud to be a euro zone member state."" 
 Estonia sees changing to the euro as marking the end of its
struggles since a 2009 recession lopped 14 percent off its
output. It hopes to entice investors by removing any fears of
devaluation and make borrowing more secure for its people, many
of whose mortgages are already in euros.
 It also caps a drive for integration with the West, away
from the influence of Russia, that began with the collapse of
the Soviet Union in 1991.
 With a similar history, neighbours Latvia and Lithuania hope
to adopt the euro in 2014 and have also had their currencies
pegged to the euro for years. 
 The kroon will be converted at the rate of 15.6466 at which
the currency was pegged to the euro. They will circulate
together as legal tender for two weeks.
 An anti-euro campaign kept up its rhetoric, saying in a
statement Estonia was ""getting the last ticket for the Titanic"".
 Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman said in a blog that
the switch was a symbol of Estonia's transformation from a
Soviet province to a good European citizen, but that the cost
had been high for the economy.
 ""So, congratulations to Estonia -- but condolences too. This
wasn't the glittering euro entrance you were promised,"" he
wrote.
 
 EASTERN SCEPTICS
 Poland, Hungary and other eastern European EU states are all
sceptical towards joining the euro. They have all promised to
join the euro zone one day but want to see how the debt problems
of Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal are solved.
 They also fear that losing flexibility exchange rates will
make them less competitive and less able to withstand financial
ructions. The debt crisis has also undermined the idea that
being a euro zone member guarantees lower borrowing costs.
 Polish central bank governor Marek Belka repeated his
scepticism to tabloid newspaper Super Express, saying Poland
would join when there was ""order"" in the euro zone. ""In the euro
zone there are dramatic things happening, so why rush?"" he said.
 Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas has said the euro would not
be to the country's advantage for a long time. Economists say
the larger eastern EU nations may now not join before 2019-2020.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel, however, reiterated Germany's
commitment to the single currency in a new year address.
 ""The euro is the foundation of our prosperity,"" she said.
""Germany needs Europe and our common currency ... We Germans
assume our responsibility, even when it is sometimes very hard.""
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy said: ""Don't believe, dear
compatriots, those who suggest that we should leave the euro ...
The end of the euro would be the end of Europe,"" he said in a
televised New Year address.
 
 POOR, BUT IN GOOD SHAPE
 Estonia will be the currency club's poorest member but its
debt and deficit levels -- the cause of the crisis for some
current euro zone members -- are among the lowest in the bloc.
 Ansip's centre-right government has slashed spending and
hiked some taxes to ensure the budget deficit stayed low.
 Ansip told a news conference Estonia had its eye on the euro
zone's woes, but was sure Greece and Ireland would cope.
 In economic terms, the single currency bloc will barely
notice the addition -- Estonia's GDP is just 0.2 percent of the
current euro zone's 8.9 trillion euros.
 Euro membership could help the Nordic banks, now the major
players in the Baltic region, led by Swedbank and SEB.
 All three Baltic nations went through Soviet, Nazi and then
Soviet occupation again, so becoming part of Western economic
and security structures has been of prime importance. They
joined NATO and a self-confident European Union in 2004.

 * Euro posts worst year since 2005 on debt fears
 * Euro zone debt troubles return to focus
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar ended a
volatile year on Friday a bit firmer than where it began with
investors gearing up for gains in early 2011 on expectations
the U.S. economic recovery was gaining momentum.
 The euro, which had its worst year against the dollar since
2005, is likely to stay under pressure as the market focuses on
Portugal, Spain and other euro zone countries struggling to
address debt and banking problems.
 The United States will release December employment data
next Friday. Economists polled by Reuters expect to see a
private sector jobs gain of 140,000 and a decline in the
jobless rate to 9.7 percent.
 Expectations of above-forecast jobs growth have grown after
data this week showed the four-week average of new jobless
claims -- a measure of underlying labor market trends -- fell
to its lowest level since July 2008.
 ""The numbers coming out of the United States over the last
two months have been on the stronger side and that is probably
going to continue next week,"" said Paresh Upadhyaya, head of
Americas G10 FX Strategy at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research
in New York.
 ""That will continue to put upward pressure on yields and
therefore the dollar will remain on the stronger side"" against
the euro, yen and sterling, he said.
 Higher U.S. yields in 2011 and Japan's increased reliance
on debt will boost the dollar -- particularly against the yen
-- said Boris Schlossberg, research director at GFT in New
York.
 The yen neared 80 per dollar earlier this year, just shy of
a post-World War Two high of 79.75 set in 1995, as long-term
U.S. interest rates fell and markets feared a sluggish U.S.
recovery was running out of steam.
 A key risk for the dollar next week, strategists at BNP
Paribas said, could come from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke's testimony to the Senate budget panel on Friday.
 ""The greater risk is that he reinforces (the Fed's)
commitment to keep rates low and any hint that further
quantitative easing beyond the $600 billion may be an option
will see the U.S. dollar weaker,"" they wrote to clients.
 For the year, the dollar was up 1.5 percent against a
basket of six currencies, but it fell about 13 percent against
the yen.
 The Australian dollar, which hit a 28-year high of $1.0257
on Friday and was up 14 percent against the greenback this
year, may extend gains if global growth remains firm and
commodity prices high. But a slowdown in China is a risk, and
some analysts said the Aussie's 2010 gains may make it ripe for
a correction next year.
 THE EURO'S STRUGGLES
 The euro finished the year down 6.7 percent against the
dollar, its biggest annual slide since 2005, hurt by a debt
crisis that engulfed Greece and Ireland, rattled Portugal and
Spain and even sowed doubts about the euro's future.
 But the euro recouped some losses in December and climbed
above $1.34 on Friday, extending a recovery from a 2010 low
beneath $1.19 -- its worst showing since early 2006.
 Traders tied much of the euro's rebound in December to thin
volume and year-end positioning, with investors taking profits
on extended bets against the currency that have built up over
recent months as fears of a euro zone debt crisis grew.
 The euro may remain under pressure early in 2011 as an
estimated 150 billion to 200 billion euros in euro zone
sovereign bonds come to market, and some investors worry demand
may be weak.
 ""Everybody it seems is anticipating a very rocky road for
the euro zone over the next three months,"" said Gareth Berry,
G10 FX strategist for UBS in Singapore.
 FRANC TO COME BACK TO EARTH?
 The dollar set a record low of 0.9301 Swiss franc on
Friday. The euro/franc pair hit a record low on Thursday at
1.2398 francs and lost 16 percent this year.
 Concerns about the euro zone debt crisis and more muted
worries about Washington's finances have enhanced the
safe-haven allure of the Swiss currency.
 Despite signs of stronger U.S. growth, the Federal Reserve
has given no indication that it plans to curtail a $600 billion
bond-buying program it started last month. Analysts also fear
an Obama administration deal to extend U.S. tax cuts could
swell the budget deficit.
 While Schlossberg extolled Switzerland's fiscal health and
called the franc ""arguably the only sound money left"" among
major currencies, he said recent gains were excessive.
 ""It's just not sustainable that a country of 7 million can
absorb the capital flows they've been absorbing,"" he said.

(Updates with European markets close)
 By Walter Brandimarte and Sebastian Tong
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - World stocks were set
to end 2010 at their highest levels in 28 months as investors
geared up for further risk-taking into 2011, prompted by a
wilting dollar and low yields on U.S. bonds.
 Recent figures pointing to stronger momentum in the world's
biggest economy failed to support the greenback, which traded
on Friday at its weakest point in nearly six weeks against a
basket of major currencies.
 The weaker dollar supported further commodity gains, with
gold on track to finish the year 30 percent higher -- its
strongest annual performance since 2007. Silver, a cheaper
safe-haven alternative to gold, jumped 80 percent in 2010. 
 Notwithstanding more upbeat U.S. economic prospects, the
Federal Reserve is expected to keep monetary conditions
ultra-loose to maintain the pace of recovery, which should keep
the dollar on the back foot through the first quarter of 2011.
 ""In many ways 2010 is ending on a similar note to 2009,
with markets rallying on hopes of economic recovery. This is
certainly in line with our view of the world economy,"" said
Keith Wade, chief economist at Schroders.
 ""However, we also recognize that the U.S. is simply kicking
the can down the road by avoiding fiscal consolidation. Markets
are also far more cautious about the scope for policymakers to
remove support than a year ago.""
 World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> drifted up 0.3 percent to their strongest
levels since September 2008 and are on track to end the year 10
percent higher.
 The benchmark MSCI index was supported on Friday by
emerging market gains, which offset some profit-taking in U.S.,
European, and Japanese markets.
 Asian stocks ended the year 15 percent higher, the prime
beneficiaries of record low interest rates in much of the
developed world.

European shares closed 7.3 percent higher for the year even
as investors pocketed part of those gains, driving the

lower.
 Emerging markets stocks rose 0.66 percent on Friday, adding
to gains of 16 percent for the year, according a benchmark MSCI
index <.MSCIEF>
 On Wall Street, the three main stock indexes seesawed
around the unchanged mark, leaving the S&P 500 on track for its
best December performance in nearly two decades -- a monthly
gain of 6.6 percent.
 For the day, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> edged
up 4.47 points, or 0.04 percent, to 11,574.18, while the
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 0.53 points, or 0.04
percent, at 1,258.41. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> fell
9.45 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,653.53.
 ""We had a nice year, as far as percentage up, really good
numbers for the year,"" said Terry Morris, senior vice president
and senior equity manager for National Penn Investors Trust
Company in Reading, Pennsylvania. ""It's just drifting and it's
entitled to a pullback.""
 BRUISED EURO
 Investors remain fretful about the debt situation in the
European Union after Italy paid higher yields on Thursday to
sell new debt.
 Still, the euro  jumped 0.86 percent against the
dollar on year-end buying by central banks and real-money
accounts. For the whole of 2010, the European single currency
is set to finish with losses of about 7 percent.
 Market confidence in the common currency was bruised this
year by emergency rescues for debt-laden Ireland and Greece.
Investors are now seeking the relative safety of the Swiss
franc, which hovers at a record peak against the euro.
 Despite a beating at year-end, the dollar was managing to
finish the year a bit firmer than it began. The greenback fell
0.8 percent against a basket of major currencies on Friday, but
kept gains of 1.3 percent against those currencies for the
year, according to the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>.
 ""We're still facing a lot of uncertainty next year, but the
U.S. economic data is starting to turn for the better, and I
think that will spark dollar gains, particularly against the
yen,"" said Boris Schlossberg, research director at GFT Forex.
 Prices of base commodity prices remained well supported,
with copper ending the year at a record high and oil poised to
gain more than 12 percent in 2010 with an average price of
nearly $80 a barrel -- the second highest on record.
 U.S. crude oil prices rose 0.93 percent on Friday to
$90.68 per barrel,

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The dollar fell broadly on
Friday as investors closed their books on 2010, but it still
managed to end a volatile year a bit firmer than where it
began, with the improving U.S. economy outlook leaving some
traders gearing up for a rally in early 2011.
 The euro rose 1 percent to $1.3394 , extending its
recovery from a 2010 low beneath $1.19 -- its worst showing
since early 2006.
 But it was set to end the year down 6.5 percent against
the dollar, hurt by a debt crisis that engulfed Greece and
Ireland, rattled Portugal and Spain and even sowed doubts about
the euro's future. It was its biggest annual slide since 2005.
 The yen, however, rose about 12 percent against the dollar
this year as long-term U.S. interest rates fell and markets
feared a sluggish U.S. recovery was running out of steam.
 On Friday, the dollar fell 0.5 percent to 81.16 yen ,
its lowest since early November.
 For the year, the dollar was up about 1.4 percent against a
basket of currencies <.DXY>, though it was 0.7 percent lower on
Friday after hitting a seven-week low against the yen and a
record low against the Swiss franc.
 Still, analysts expect a more durable U.S. economy and
Europe's debt crisis to spark dollar gains in early 2011.
 SUNNY GROWTH OUTLOOK
 U.S. manufacturing and consumer data has improved in recent
months and the private sector has started adding more jobs,
though the unemployment rate remains high at 9.8 percent.
 ""We're still facing a lot of uncertainty next year, but the
U.S. economic data is starting to turn for the better and I
think that will spark dollar gains, particularly against the
yen,"" said Boris Schlossberg, research director at GFT Forex.
 The United States will release December employment data
next Friday, and economists polled by Reuters expect to see a
private sector job gain of 140,000.
 Schlossberg said higher U.S. bond yields in 2011 and
Japan's increased reliance on debt will eventually put pressure
on the yen, which neared 80 per dollar earlier this year, just
shy of a post-World War II high of 79.75 yen set in 1995.
 UBS strategist Geoffrey Yu said expectations for more
robust U.S. growth means U.S. securities are likely to continue
their trend of attracting strong inflows in January, and that
should provide a near-term boost for the greenback.
 The Australian dollar, which hit a 28-year high of $1.0257
 on Friday and was up 14 percent against the greenback
this year, may also extend gains if global growth remains firm
and commodity prices high. But a slowdown in China is a risk,
and some analysts said the Aussie's 2010 gains may make it ripe
for a correction next year.
 THE EURO'S STRUGGLES
 Traders tied much of the dollar's losses this week to thin
volume and year-end positioning, with many investors taking
profits on extended bets against the euro that have built up
over recent months as fears of a euro zone debt crisis grew.
 The euro's repeated inability in recent weeks to hold below
a 200-day moving average, now at $1.3085, has also contributed
to recent gains. Traders cited buying by Asian central banks
and real money accounts.
 The euro may remain under pressure early in 2011 as an
estimated 150 to 200 billion euros in euro zone sovereign bonds
come to market, and some investors worry demand may be weak.
 ""Everybody, it seems, is anticipating a very rocky road for

 * Second currency devaluation in 12 months
 * Chavez risks political hit from poor voters
(Adds quote, details, paragraphs 13-15, edits)
 By Daniel Wallis and Deisy Buitrago
 CARACAS, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Venezuelans worried on Friday
that a second devaluation of their currency in 12 months would
make life even harder as the socialist government of President
Hugo Chavez struggled to turn the economy around.
 Already suffering one of the world's highest inflation
rates and the only major Latin American economy still in
recession after the global financial crisis, they fear the New
Year devaluation could hit their livelihoods more.
 ""It is a blow against the pockets of the workers, against
the poorest people,"" said Robinson Calua, a 50-year-old
security guard in downtown Caracas.
 Officials say the devaluation announced on Thursday will
increase spending and boost growth in South America's biggest
oil producer, while easing the pressure on foreign reserves and
freeing up dollars for imports.
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 For full coverage, see [ID:nN3093897]
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 The move scrapped the lowest rate of a complex, multitiered
forex system that few Venezuelans or outsiders properly
understood and even taxed the brains of Wall Street experts.
 With a handful of different exchange rates for everything
from medicines to factory machinery, not to mention an active
currency black market, analysts said the structure encouraged
corruption and inefficiency and was prone to collapse.
 The elimination of the strongest rate of 2.6 bolivars to
the dollar should improve the government's balance sheet and
could please bondholders, but will make goods like medicines
and some food items more expensive.
 In the near future, that is likely to feed an inflation
rate that the central bank estimates was 26.9 percent in 2010.
 Chavez, who has inherited Fidel Castro's mantle as Latin
America's leading critic of the United States during his nearly
12 years in power, has increased his government's role in the
economy through regulations and a wave of nationalizations.
 He has accelerated efforts to entrench his self-styled
""21st century socialism"" in recent weeks, and apparently chose
to order the devaluation as soon as possible before seeking
re-election at the next presidential poll in December 2012.
 That way, his government takes any economic pain and
inflationary pressure -- and possible social consequences -- in
2011 and hopes to have more funds for the election campaign.
 It is a gamble, though, because the firebrand president
draws his core support from Venezuela's sprawling barrios and
poor rural areas, where any price rises will be felt most.
 Venezuelan blogger Juan Cristobal said the impact would be
somewhat muted because getting official approval for dollars at
the 2.6 rate had been hard, and he contested the government's
view the move put citizens at the heart of economic decisions.
 People would have less disposable income because of price
rises, he said, which would delay the recovery from recession.
 ""So yes, human beings were placed at the center of this
economic decision -- in the same way a turkey is placed at the
center of your New Years' Eve dinner table,"" Cristobal wrote.
 FAR CRY FROM OIL BOOM DAYS
 A legislative vote in September showed the electorate split
down the middle, but the charismatic Chavez remains by far the
country's single most popular politician.
 The outgoing parliament gave Chavez special decree powers
for the next 18 months, which he says he will soon use to
increase the country's sales tax from its current 12 percent.
 Jenny Diaz, a 39-year-old administrative assistant, was
told about the devaluation while she was lining up to buy a new
washing machine before any sales tax hike came into effect.
 ""Food is going to become more expensive, but our salaries
will remain the same,"" she told Reuters with a sigh.
 The move could help Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA,
which previously had to sell nearly 30 percent of its revenue
at the old rate of 2.6 bolivars to the dollar. It will now be
able to book it all at 4.3 bolivars.
 The devaluation had been widely forecast by Wall Street
analysts, who said it was overdue but perhaps did not go far
enough. Most said they expected the authorities in Caracas to
take more currency measures going forward.
 Daniel Kerner of the Eurasia Group think-tank said that
unlike January's major formal devaluation, the latest change
did not do much to alter the overall economic picture.
 ""Foreign exchange shortages will likely remain problematic,
and the government will continue to rely on debt issuance to
finance spending and address forex shortages,"" he said.
 Venezuela's currency has an unstable history. Financial
turmoil in the 1990s led to rapid loss in value, with bands,
fixed rates and a free float all failing to stop the decline.
 It is a far cry from the oil boom days of the 1970s, when
the country was nicknamed ""Saudi Venezuela"" and the bolivar was
one of the region's strongest currencies, letting middle-class
Venezuelans enjoy lots of foreign travel and cheap shopping.
 Some Venezuelans became known, one joke went, for always
saying ""Dame dos!"" (Give me two!) when stocking up at expensive
Miami malls during a period that many still remember fondly.
 The devaluation should help fatten the state's coffers and
that should cheer bondholders -- though Venezuelan debt trades
more on global oil prices and investor appetite for risk.
 From Jan. 1, dollars will be available at the official
rates of 4.3 bolivars for some preferential goods and 5.3 to
the dollar via the central bank's SITME exchange system.
 One option for the government could be to let the SITME
rate weaken. All eyes are now on what further fiscal steps
Chavez will take using his decree powers.

commodity prices and pulled up the Australian dollar. China is

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The dollar fell broadly on
Friday as investors closed their books on 2010 but still
managed to end a volatile year a bit firmer than where it
began, leaving some gearing up for a rally in early 2011.
 The euro rose Friday 0.8 percent to at $1.3386, extending
its recovery from a 2010 low beneath $1.19 -- its worst showing
since early 2006.
 But it was still set to end the year down almost 7 percent
against the dollar, hurt by a debt crisis that engulfed Greece
and Ireland, rattled Portugal and Spain and even sowed doubts
about the currency's future.
 The yen, however, rose some 12 percent against the dollar
this year as long-term U.S. interest rates fell and markets
feared a sluggish U.S. recovery was running out of steam. 
 The dollar fell 0.4 percent to 81.21 yen on Friday.
 For the year, the dollar up about 1.5 percent against a
basket of major currencies, though it was half a percent lower
on Friday, pulled down as the greenback hit a seven-week low
against the yen and a record low against the Swiss franc.
 Still, analysts expect continued strong global growth, a
more durable U.S. economy and lingering worries about Europe to
lead to dollar gains in early 2011.
 ""We're still facing a lot of uncertainty next year, but the
U.S. economic data is starting to turn for the better, and I
think that will spark dollar gains, particularly against the
yen,"" said Boris Schlossberg, research director at GFT Forex.
 He said higher U.S. bond yields and Japan's increased
reliance on debt will eventually put pressure on the yen, which
neared 80 per dollar earlier this year, just shy of a
post-World War II high of 79.75 yen set in 1995.
 The dollar was last at 81.21 yen, down 0.4 percent from
late Thursday.
 THE EURO'S STRUGGLES
 Traders tied much of the dollar's losses this week to thin
volume and year-end positioning, with many investors taking
profits on extended bets against the euro that have built up
over recent months as fears of a euro zone debt crisis grew.
 The euro's repeated refusal in recent weeks to hold below a
200-day moving average, now at $1.3085, has also contributed to
recent gains.
 Traders cited buying by Asian central banks and real money
accounts, while option barriers are reported at $1.3400.
 The euro has lost nearly 7 percent against the dollar and
about 18 percent against the yen in 2010. It is likely to stay
under pressure as an estimated 150 to 200 billion euros in euro
zone sovereign bonds hits the market in the next two months.
 ""Everybody, it seems, is anticipating a very rocky road for
the euro zone over the next three months,"" said Gareth Berry,
G10 FX strategist for UBS in Singapore. Market players seemed
worried demand for euro zone debt issues could be weak.
 Some analyst tied the Swiss franc's recent rise to worries
about both euro zone and U.S. finances.
 Despite signs of stronger U.S. growth, the Federal Reserve
has given no indication that it plans to curtail a $600 billion
bond-buying program that began in November. Some analysts have
also worried that a deal to extend U.S. tax cuts for all
earners could put additional pressure on a stretched budget.
 The dollar set a record low against the Swiss franc of
0.9322 on Friday while the euro traded at 1.2515 francs after
hittin a record low of 1.2398 Thursday.
 FRANC TO COME BACK TO EARTH?
 But while Schlossberg extolled Switzerland's fiscal health
and called the franc ""arguably the only sound money left"" among
major currencies, he said it's rise has become extended.
 ""It's just not sustainable that a country of seven million
can absorb the capital flows they've been absorbing from both
Europe and the United States,"" he said.
 In a note to clients, UBS strategist Geoffrey Yu said a
pattern of strong inflows into U.S. securities in January
should boost the dollar and said its rise could be notably
pronounced against the franc.
 Robust global growth should also support commodity-linked
currencies such as the Australian dollar, which rose 13 percent
against its U.S. counterpart in 2010 and 22 percent against the
euro. It was trading at $1.0175 on Friday, near a 28-peak of
$1.0198 touched on Thursday.
 Risks, however, include a slowdown in the Chinese economy,
which relies heavily on Australian commodities. Analysts said
tighter monetary policy there could also hurt domestic demand
and push down the Aussie dollar.

 LONDON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Financial markets enter 2011 with
many investors persuaded that the world economy is on the mend
and that riskier assets such as stocks are set to do well.
 Data from Reuters asset allocation polls and State Street's
investor confidence index suggest investors are positioned for
more stock gains and a continued move away from supposedly safer
assets such as government bonds and low-yielding cash.
 The Reuters polls, for example, showed equity holdings among
leading investors at a 10-month high in December, while State
Street's index for the month moved into bullish territory for
the first time since March.
 But the waning days of 2010 suggest investors will almost
immediately have to face three major risks to their rather
bullish mood.
 In no particular order, those are: China's trade, America's
economy and the fate of billions of dollars pumped into
benchmark government bonds.
 Of the three, the pace of recovery in the U.S. economy will
be most clearly on display, with monthly U.S. jobs data due to
be released on Jan. 7.
 It may take on extra importance this month as much of the
change in investors' appetite for risk has come about as signs
have increased that the U.S. slowdown in mid-2010 was only
temporary.
 U.S. equities, for example, have recovered to the extent
that the over-the-counter Nasdaq index has actually outperformed
much-touted emerging market stocks, as measured by MSCI.
 But some data was disappointing in the past week, notably
consumer sentiment and housing, which, with jobs, go to the
heart of future confidence and spending.
 U.S. equities have been among the big winners since Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke made clear in August that the Fed
would buy more assets to boost liquidity in the U.S. economy.
 The S&P 500 index, for example, is up around 20 percent
since his Jackson Hole Aug. 27 speech.
 So any sign that the U.S. economy is not recovering as
thought could cause an early reversal.
 
 PRICEY TREASURIES
 A not-unrelated worry is the Treasury market, which has been
hit by a combination of rising prices for riskier assets, the
impact of tax cuts on the already large U.S. deficit, and a
general feeling that bonds may be overbought.
 The past few weeks have seen a few days of large sell-offs,
including one following dismal demand at an auction for
five-year paper.
 ""Short- to medium-term maturities generally offer poor
value,"" Tristan Hanson, strategist at wealth manager Ashburton
told clients recently.
 He added, however, that longer-term 30-year paper was a good
backstop against any renewal of concern about global growth.
 An orderly sell-off of bonds would not unduly worry
investors and would fit with their scenario of rising ""risk""
assets.
 Were Treasuries and other benchmark bonds such as Bunds to
sell off too sharply, however, significantly higher yields would
unsettle investors and have the reverse impact on liquidity than
that sought after by the Fed and various other authorities.
 Reuters latest polls on expected bond yields found a median
projection of 3.40 percent for U.S. Treasuries around a year
from now. The yield has already revisited those levels this
week.
 
 RARE EARTH
 The third risk that investors may face in the coming week is
China's decision to cut its export quotas for rare earth
minerals by 35 percent for the first half of 2011 versus a year
ago.
 Rare earth minerals are used in a range of products from MP3
players and computer hard drives to hybrid cars, wind turbines,
light bulbs and coffee makers.
 They are also not as scarce as their name implies, but China
has cornered about 97 percent of the market by producing them
far cheaper than anyone else can.
 The issue for investors is not so much whether the prices
rise -- although it won't ease the concerns of those who fear a
return to inflation in the developed world.
 What may concern them most is the potential for China's
action to trigger trade disputes. The United States and European
Union have already either expressed concerns or reminded China
of its supply obligations.
 It may prove a fleeting concern, but investors have listed
for some time the danger of trade wars as one of the biggest
threats to the recovering global economy.

(Adds Estonian prime minister quotes)
 By David Mardiste
 TALLINN, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Estonia could be the last new
entrant for some years when it becomes the 17th euro zone member
on Jan. 1, with the club's deepening crisis of confidence likely
to put off larger eastern European states for up to a decade.
 Crowds queued at some banks in the snow blanketed capital,
Tallinn, on Friday to exchange cash, mainly coins, in a move the
small Baltic state of 1.3 million hopes will mark the end of its
struggles since the 2008 financial crisis.
 Joining the euro caps a drive for integration with the West
and away from the influence of Russia that began with the
collapse of the Soviet Union. Estonia is the first former Soviet
state to adopt the single currency and neighbours Latvia and
Lithuania hope to follow.
 The government, battling its way out of a recession that
knocked almost a fifth off GDP last year, hopes the move will
shore up interest of Nordic banks in the economy, add to its
appeal for other investors and make borrowing easier and more
secure for ordinary citizens.
 ""Our Estonian kroons are really beautiful bank notes, but,
unfortunately, investors cannot trust those beautiful bank notes
as much as they can trust euros,"" Prime Minister Andrus Ansip
told a news conference.
 ""It will be really beneficial to join as soon as possible
and now it will happen,"" added Ansip, who will be one of the
first to take euros out of a cash machine at midnight.
 Baltic neighbours Latvia and Lithuania hope to follow into
the single currency club in 2014, cementing the independence
they gained with Estonia from Moscow in 1991.
 The country will become the 17th member of the euro zone in
celebrations which will include EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner
Ollie Rehn and the prime ministers of Latvia and Lithuania.
 Estonia's kroon will be converted at a rate of 15.6466.
 
 EASTERN SCEPTICS
 Elsewhere in the former Communist bloc, governments are far
less keen. Poland, Hungary and other central and eastern
European EU members have all promised to join the euro zone one
day, but they are in no hurry. 
 They want to see how the debt problems of Ireland, Greece,
Spain and Portugal are solved and fear that losing the
flexibility of their exchange rates will make them less
competitive and less able to withstand financial ructions.
 The debt crisis has also undermined the idea that being a
euro zone member guarantees lower borrowing costs and -- in
contrast to the Poles and others -- Estonia, Lithuania and
Latvia have had their currencies pegged to the euro for years. 
 ""There are more risks to being in the euro zone than being
outside,"" Polish central bank governor Marek Belka said earlier
this month.
 Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas has said adopting the euro
would not be to the country's advantage for a long time and
economists say the larger eastern Europeans may not now join
before 2019-2020.
 A British think-tank on Friday said the euro has only a
one-in-five chance of surviving in its current form over the
next 10 years because of competitive imbalances between members.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel, however, reiterated Germany's
commitment to the single currency in a new year address. 
 ""The euro is the foundation of our prosperity,"" she said.
""Germany needs Europe and our common currency. (...) We Germans
assume our responsibility, even when it is sometimes very hard.""
 
 POOR, BUT IN GOOD SHAPE
 Estonia will be the currency club's poorest member after a
brutal recession in 2009, but its debt and deficit levels -- the
cause of the crisis for some current euro zone members -- are
among the lowest in the bloc.
 Ansip's centre-right government also slashed spending and
hiked some taxes to ensure the budget deficit stayed low.
 ""We know what is happening in some euro zone member states
and of course we also worry about what is happening in Greece,
what is happening in Ireland, but I am sure they will be able to
handle all those challenges,"" Ansip added.
 In economic terms, the single currency bloc will barely
notice the addition -- Estonia's gross domestic product is just
0.2 percent of the current euro zone's 8.9 trillion euros.
 The Balts also hope euro membership will in time confer
greater political and economic stability after the crisis set
back a previously successful transformation from Communism.
 It could also help the Nordic banks, now the major players
in the region, led by Swedbank and SEB.
 All three Baltic nations went through Soviet, Nazi and then
Soviet occupation again, so becoming part of western economic
and security structures has been of prime importance. They
joined NATO and a self-confident European Union in 2004.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The euro edged up to a two-week
high against the dollar on Friday on year-end buying by central
banks, while the Swiss franc hovered near a record high against
the U.S. currency in thin trade.
 The dollar was under pressure, hovering near a seven-week
low against the yen while commodity currencies such as the
Australian dollar remained in favour on expectations that Asia
will lead a robust global recovery in 2011.
 The euro was up 0.75 percent at $1.3380, holding
just above its 100-day moving average of $1.3370 and having hit
a two-week high of $1.3391 on trading platform EBS.
 Traders cited buying by Asian central banks and real money
accounts that led to stops being triggered. Option barriers are
reported at $1.3400, with stops said to be lined up at $1.3405. 
 ""It is a stop-hunting exercise in these thin trading
conditions,"" said Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of
New York Mellon.
 ""Going into 2011, pressure remains on the euro as one can
see from the price action in euro/Swissie. The dollar is also
under pressure but the euro is the least favoured.""
 The dollar set an all-time low against the Swiss franc of
0.9339 francs on trading platform EBS. It pared its losses to
stand at 0.9355, flat for the day.
 The euro was up 0.7 percent at 1.2515 Swiss francs,
recovering from Thursday's record low of 1.2398 francs.
 For the year the euro has shed over 15 percent against the
franc as euro zone peripheral debt problems prompted many
investors to seek the relative safety of the Swiss currency.
 ""Everybody, it seems, is anticipating a very rocky road for
the euro zone over the next three months,"" said Gareth Berry,
G10 FX strategist for UBS in Singapore. Market players seemed
worried demand for euro zone debt issues could be weak.
 The euro has lost nearly 7 percent versus the dollar and
over 18 percent against the yen in 2010. It is likely to stay
under pressure as an estimated 150 to 200 billion euros in euro
zone sovereign bonds hits the market in the next two months.
 
 DOLLAR UNDER PRESSURE
 Despite the euro zone's troubles, the dollar's inability to
gain much boded ill, traders said. The dollar was down 0.3
percent against the yen at 81.30 yen, not far from a seven-week
low of 81.28 yen hit on Thursday.
 It is only about two yen away from a post-World War Two
record low of 79.75 set in 1995.
 It has shed over 12 percent against the yen this year and
whether it starts clawing back those losses in 2011 will depend
largely on how durable the U.S. recovery proves to be -- with
the jury still out given a recent mixed run of data.
 Next week, U.S. non-farm payrolls numbers will give insight
on the labour market while traders will await Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke's testimony to the Senate budget panel.
 Bernanke has sounded extremely cautious about the economy's
prospects but that was before a new tax cut plan was unveiled
that is expected to boost demand and growth.
 ""It will be interesting to see how and if this changed
Bernanke's mind at all with regards to the risks of inflation
and the 'self-sustainability' of the recovery,"" RBC Capital
Markets said in a report.
 ""These factors will dictate just how flexible Bernanke and
company are with regards to the $600 billion in (planned asset)
purchases.""
 Meanwhile, investors stayed in the hunt for growth-linked
currencies. The Aussie was flat at $1.0170 and not far from a
28-year peak of $1.0198 set on Thursday. 
 The Aussie has rallied 13 percent against the dollar this
year and is up a whopping 22 percent against the euro, making it
one of the best performing currencies of 2010.

 LONDON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - World stocks are set to end the
year at their highest levels in 28 months as investors gear up
for continued risk-taking into 2011, prompted by a wilting
dollar and narrowing yields on safe-haven U.S. bonds.
 U.S. figures pointing to stronger momentum in the world's
biggest economy failed to rouse the greenback <.DXY>, which
slipped on Friday to trade at its weakest against its basket of
major currencies in nearly three weeks.
 Factory activity in the Midwest expanded in December at its
fastest pace in over 22 years, while pending sales of previous
owned homes rose more than expected in November. The country's
stubbornly high unemployment rate also showed signs of easing.
[ID:nN3097646]
 Notwithstanding more upbeat U.S. economic prospects, the
Federal Reserve is expected to keep monetary conditions
ultra-loose to maintain the pace of recovery, which should keep
the dollar on the back foot through the first quarter of 2011.
 ""In many ways 2010 is ending on a similar note to 2009,
with markets rallying on hopes of economic recovery. This is
certainly in line with our view of the world economy,"" said
Keith Wade, chief economist at Schroders.
 ""However, we also recognise that the U.S. is simply kicking
the can down the road by avoiding fiscal consolidation. Markets
are also far more cautious about the scope for policymakers to
remove support than a year ago.""
 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it expects a
two-speed global recovery to extend into 2011 with developing
economies growing slowly while emerging markets power ahead.
[ID:nN30108108]
 World stocks <.MIWD00000PUS> drifted up 0.2 percent to
their strongest levels since September 2008 and are on track to

 European shares <.FTEU3>, heading for an 8-percent gain
this year, dipped slightly in light trade on the last trading

 BRUISED EURO

 The euro  edged up to a two-week high against the
dollar on year-end buying by central banks but is set to end
2010 weaker by 7 percent against the dollar.
 Market confidence in the common currency was bruised this
year by emergency rescues for debt-laden Ireland and Greece.
 Investors are seeking the relative safety of the Swiss
franc, which hovers at a record peak against the euro
.
 The dollar has fared little better against the franc
, languishing at a new record low on the last day of the
year.
 China's tightly managed yuan , a source of
irritation for U.S. lawmakers who say it is kept artificially
weak, closed up 3.6 percent against the dollar this year.
 The yuan is near its highest level since the currency's
landmark devaluation in July 2005.
 March Bund futures  were 59 ticks higher at 125.50
while emerging sovereign spreads <11EMJ> traded 5 basis points
tighter.
 Commodity prices remained well supported, with copper
ending the year at a record high  and oil poised to gain

$80 a barrel -- the second highest on record.

will see even more gains next year.	
 The currency closed at 6.5897 per dollar, capping nine
trading days that saw it rise 1.3 percent from a recent low
and giving a decisive close to the year after the currency
zig-zagged from mid-October to mid-December.	
 The yuan's strength came after the People's Bank of China
(PBOC) set its mid-point at a record high for the second
straight day, signalling the central bank may be engineering a
fresh leg of yuan appreciation ahead of the visit by Chinese
President Hu Jintao to the United States in mid-January.	
 But the central bank also sent a signal that coming
rises in the yuan would not be drastic, as the fixing was
just two pips higher than Thursday's.	
 China-based traders expect the yuan to rise about 2
percent in the first quarter of 2011. For all of next year, it
could gain around 6 percent as Beijing uses currency
appreciation as a tool to fight consumer inflation, which hit
a 28-month high in November, they said.	
 ""There will be no linear appreciation, but zig-zags,"" said
a senior trader at a U.S. bank in Shanghai. ""But overall, you
can still see significant rises by the end of certain periods,
with opportunities open for those who have good understanding
of the complicated Chinese currency system.""	
 One of those opportunities could be in the first two weeks
of the year, ahead of President Hu's U.S. visit,
some traders say.	
 While the Chinese government generally tries to paint a
picture of resisting U.S. pressure for yuan appreciation, in
reality it often lets the currency strengthen ahead of major
political events in recognition of the importance of the ties
between the world's two biggest economies.	
 
 
 RECORD HIGH	
 Dealers said offshore forwards , which imply
yuan appreciation of less than 1 percent against the dollar in
three months, are underestimating the yuan's potential and so
present a window to short dollars in contracts out to one year.	
 Three-month one-year non-deliverable dollar/yuan forwards
(NDFs) fell to 6.5657 in late trade
from Thursday's 6.5670, implying yuan appreciation in
three months' time of 0.87 percent. That's up from
0.85 percent but lags by far the 2 percent rise foreseen by
onshore traders in the first quarter.	
 Benchmark one-year NDFs were bid at
6.4318 from Thursday's close of 6.4508. Implied yuan
appreciation in a year's time rose to 2.97 percent
from 2.66 percent.	
 ""I think the NDF market is going short USD into the New
Year, with more confidence in Hu's visit to Washington in
January,"" said a trader in Singapore.	
 ""That is also part of the factor in causing other USD/Asia
to head lower. One-year USD/CNY NDFs could move toward 6.41
when Hu visits the U.S.,"" he said, adding the tenor was
lagging now because many traders were on holiday.	
 Woon Khien Chia, a strategist at The Royal Bank of
Scotland in Singapore, said: ""My suspicion is that some of the
recent changes, the latest being the curbs on net open CNY
positions in Hong Kong banks, might have curtailed NDF
activities.""	
 Still, the PBOC appears reluctant to let the
yuan rise too fast because of the threat of speculative
capital inflows seeking returns on higher interest rates and
expectations of yuan appreciation, traders said.	
 China has seen a steady increase of fund inflows in the
last decade. The latest central bank data showed capital
inflows slowed in November from a near record high in October
but were still at a relatively high level. [ID:nTOE6BI00V]

 * Sees benefits from membership despite euro crisis
 * Other Baltic states hope to adopt euro in 2014
 
 By David Mardiste
 TALLINN, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Estonia could be the last new
entrant for some years when it becomes the 17th euro zone member
on Jan. 1, with the club's deepening crisis of confidence likely
to put off larger eastern European states for up to a decade.
 European Monetary Affairs Commissioner Ollie Rehn and the
prime ministers of Latvia and Lithuania meet in Tallinn on
Friday to hail Estonia's euro entry from midnight, capping a
drive for integration with the West and away from the influence
of Russia that began with the collapse of the Soviet Union.
 It also brings the euro to a former Soviet state for the
first time. Baltic neighbours Latvia and Lithuania hope to join
in 2014, cementing the independence they gained in 1991.
 But elsewhere in the former Communist bloc, governments are
not so certain. Poland, Hungary and other central and eastern
European EU members have all promised to join the euro zone one
day, but they are in no hurry. 
 They want to see how the debt problems of Ireland, Greece,
Spain and Portugal are solved and fear losing flexibility of
their exchange rates will make them less competitive and less
able to withstand further financial ructions. 
 The debt crisis has also undermined the idea that being a
euro zone member guarantees lower borrowing costs.
 ""There are more risks to being in the euro zone than being
outside,"" Polish central bank governor Marek Belka said earlier
this month.
 Similar sentiments have come from the Czech Republic, where
Prime Minister Petr Necas has said adopting the euro would not
be to the country's advantage for a long time.
 ""The Czechs have always been more cautious and the Poles are
getting more cautious too,"" said Capital Economics economist
Neil Shearing. 
 Even if the euro zone survives in its current form, he said,
the next new entrant would not be until 2015. Many economists
now expect the larger eastern Europeans will not join before the
end of the decade.
 
 STRONGER IN THE END
 Leaders in Estonia, which will be the currency club's 17th
and poorest member after a brutal recession in 2009 knocked
almost a fifth off its GDP, have brushed off concerns the
project might backfire.
 ""The euro area debt problems are not caused by the euro and
the ongoing economic crisis. The seeds of the problems were sown
decades ago,"" President Toomas Ilves said in a recent speech.
 ""Therefore the solving of the current problems make the euro
only stronger and Estonia has the opportunity to be immediately
involved in this process.""
 Prime Minister Andrus Ansip is set to be one of the first to
take euros out of a cash machine set up specially for the event,
and the head of the central bank will give a television address
shortly before midnight on December 31.
 In economic terms, the single currency bloc will barely
notice the addition -- Estonia's gross domestic product is just
0.2 percent of the current euro zone's 8.9 trillion euros.
 Unlike the Poles, Czechs and Hungarians, Estonia is also
used to having little currency flexibility. Its kroon has been
pegged to the euro under a tight currency board for 18 years and
will be converted at a rate of 15.6466. The Latvian and
Lithuanian currencies are also pegged to the euro.
 Looking beyond the single currency zone's woes, the Baltic
region is hoping euro membership will in time confer greater
political and economic stability after the financial crisis set
back a previously successful transformation from Communism.
 All three Baltic nations went through Soviet, Nazi and then
Soviet occupation again, so becoming part of western economic
and security structures has been of prime importance. They
joined NATO and a self-confident European Union in 2004.
 ""Over the longer term there are less risk of uncertainties
and instability in the euro area than in the Baltic region and
thus this should be positive for Estonia, despite the short-term
challenges,"" said Nordea analyst Annika Lindblad.

 * White House had applauded India's move on payments	

(Recasts)	
 By Nidhi Verma and Ramin Mostafavi	
 NEW DELHI/TEHRAN, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Iran said an Friday
that an oil payments impasse with India had been resolved by
changing the currency of settlement, according to its Fars
news agency, which would preserve a trade in crude worth $12
billion a year.	
 Central bank officials from Iran and India met in Mumbai
on Friday in an effort to keep the oil trade running, and
forcing New Delhi to strike a delicate balance between its
energy needs and its global diplomatic interests.	
 ""By changing the currency for oil transaction between Iran
and India the problem was solved,"" Iran's deputy oil minister,
Ahmad Khaledi, was quoted as saying by the semi-official Fars.	
 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said last week that oil
trade payments to Iran could no longer be settled using a
long-standing clearinghouse system run by regional central
banks, and Tehran has refused to sell oil outside the old
set-up.	
 This week, the RBI extended the move to apply to all
current account transactions.	
 The White House, which wants governments to stop dealing
with Iran because of its nuclear programme, praised the move,
which came less than two months after President Barack Obama's
trip to India on which he pledged to help boost New Delhi's
global role.	
 A spokeswoman with the Indian central bank did not have an
immediate comment on Friday.	
 ""In order to not allow Americans and Europeans to create
any problem, we said let's do our business in other currencies
like (Emirate) dirham or (Japanese) yen,"" Khaledi was quoted
as saying.	
 Indian officials and traders had been hopeful of a quick
resolution to the payments row that could have disrupted about
13 percent of its oil imports and leave refiners scrambling
for expensive alternative sources of crude.	
 ""We are extremely hopeful that this impasse will be
resolved shortly as Indian companies every week get crude
supplies from Iran,"" B. Mukherjee, head of finance at
state-run Hindustan Petroleum Corp , told Reuters
earlier on Friday.	
 Other importers of Iranian crude include state-run Indian
Oil Corp and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals
Ltd and privately-run Essar Oil .	
 U.N. sanctions on Iran do not cover oil sales.	


 ALTERNATIVES	
 India and Iran could agree to settle deals in Iran's rial
or another currency such as the yen, Indian Oil Secretary S.
Sundareshan suggested on Thursday.	
 South Korea pays for Iranian crude using the won.	
 Payments could also be routed through a third-country
central or commercial bank.	
 An economy growing at about 9 percent a year has made
India the world's fourth-largest importer of crude. Iran is
its second largest supplier after Saudi Arabia.	
 Indian oil importers get 90 days credit for payment so
they are covered for old transactions, but future shipments
would be in jeopardy if the matter had not been resolved.	
 India buys about 400,000 barrels per day of Iranian crude,
settling payments through the Asian Clearing Union, a system
created in the 1970s by central banks in South Asia and Iran
to clear trade payments between them.	
 Critics say the scheme is opaque to the monitoring of
flows into Iranian organisations against which the United
States has sanctions, as settlements are made on a net basis
every two months.	
 Suspending Iranian imports when global crude prices are at
near two-year highs and when Indian inflation is uncomfortably
high would be costly for India.	
 India and Iran have long-standing ties but analysts say
irritants and a new strategic thinking are prompting New Delhi
to adopt a more nuanced and assertive policy.	
 New Delhi's interests are increasingly tied with the
United States, and it is also mindful of Arab concerns over
Iran's nuclear ambitions.	
 ""When it comes to Iran, India can ignore pressure from the
U.S. and noises from Israel, but it cannot ignore concerns
from the Arab countries,"" said P.R. Kumaraswamy, head of West
Asian studies at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.	
 ""In a very subtle way, India is sending a message that its
closeness with Iran will not affect relations with other
Middle Eastern countries.""

 * Euro edges up vs USD, though outlook troubled
 * Markets thin with Japan, others already on holiday
 By Ian Chua and Masayuki Kitano
 SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc
touched a record high against the dollar on Friday and was
within reach of a record peak against the euro, though trade
was thin on the last trading day of the year.
 Many Asian centres, including Japan, are closed and
traders expect little market action over the course of the
day, apart from some end-of-month and end-of-year corporate
orders.
 ""Fundamentally, we think dollar/Swiss should be around
parity in one-month's time and euro/Swiss around 1.30, but
fundamentals don't really come into it when investors are
scared about sovereign risk,"" said Gareth Berry, G10 FX
strategist for UBS in Singapore.
 ""Everybody, it seems, is anticipating a very rocky road
for the euro zone over the next three months beginning in
January,"" Berry said, adding that market players seem worried
that demand for forthcoming issuance of euro zone debt could
be weak.
 ""The yen, franc and the dollar are the traditional safe
havens, but the edge that the franc has over the other two
right now is that the fiscal position in Switzerland is very,
very stable,"" he added.
 The dollar set an all-time low of against the Swiss franc
of 0.9343 francs on trading platform EBS.
 With that fall, the dollar dipped below support at around
0.9355, where a trendline drawn off the dollar's lows in
December 2008, November 2009, and October 2010, now lies.
 The dollar later pared its losses to stand at 0.9375 franc
, up 0.3 percent from late U.S. trading on Thursday.
 The euro edged up 0.3 percent versus the Swiss franc to
1.2458 francs , having dropped to a record low of
1.2398 francs the previous day.
 ""The continuation of the sell euro, buy Swiss story will
move into next year. Europe will definitely be a big focus and
I wouldn't be surprised to see a European country default in
2011,"" a trader at a U.S. investment bank said.
 ""I think the U.S. economy will also show more convincing
signs of recovery next year, so I'd be looking to buy U.S.
dollars, maybe after March. The first quarter will probably
see a strong rally in equities, so it'll be a risk-on
environment.""
 Indeed, jobless claims and factory data on Thursday
bolstered views the U.S. economy gained momentum at year-end,
setting the stage for a stronger performance in 2011.
 If proved accurate, that could see the Federal Reserve
step back from providing more stimulus, a positive for the
greenback.
 For now though, the dollar was languishing and last traded
at 81.52 yen , near a seven-week low of 81.28 yen hit on
Thursday. The dollar is only about two yen away from a
post-World War Two record low of 79.75 yen set in 1995.
 The euro edged up 0.1 percent on the day to $1.3297
, but is down some 7 percent against the dollar over the
year. Hit by the euro zone debt crisis, the euro lost 19
percent versus the yen  and 16 percent against the
Swiss franc.
 With no resolution in sight to the euro zone debt crisis,
many market players expect more euro weakness early next year.
 Still, the currency's downside has been limited by buying
interest from central banks, particularly from Asia, emerging
around the $1.3000 area.
 The dollar is about 12 percent lower against the yen and
down more than 9 percent versus the Swiss franc this year.
 In contrast, the Aussie has rallied 13 percent against the
dollar in 2010 and is up a whopping 22 percent against the
euro, making it one of the best performing currencies in 2010.
 It last traded at $1.0164 , within easy reach of a
28-year peak of $1.0198 set on Thursday. Traders said there is
selling interest at $1.02 and support at $1.0130.
 The currency has been underpinned by record high copper
prices and solid gains in iron ore, one of Australia's top
exports, thanks to insatiable appetite from Asia, particularly
China.

1039,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2010 08:04PM ET</span>",Germany's Schaeuble scorns e-bonds idea - paper," BERLIN, Dec 30 (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble reiterated on Thursday the euro zone should not issue
joint sovereign bonds to tackle future crises, adding that the
euro would prove to be a stable international currency.
 ""The higher yield level expressed in so-called spreads is
both incentive and sanction (to have a stable fiscal policy),""
Schaeuble wrote in a contribution to the German Tagesspiegel
newspaper to be published on Thursday.
 He added that Greece's and Ireland's failure to repay their
debt were signs the system worked.
 ""That's why this mechanism should not be put out of work
through a collectivisation of the yield level, including in the
form of euro bonds,"" Schaeuble added.
 Germany has been determined to kill off the idea of issuing
common European bonds, a proposal championed by Jean-Claude
Juncker, the chairman of euro zone finance ministers, among
others, with the aim of stepping up fiscal integration.
 While peripheral euro zone countries are struggling with
the burden of a sovereign debt crisis, Germany -- Europe's
largest economy -- is steaming ahead and widening the gap with
its peers.
 Germany fears euro bonds would raise its borrowing costs --
the lowest in the European Union -- and make it subsidise
profligate states. It also worries E-bonds would reduce market
discipline on countries to reduce their budget deficits.
 Schaeuble wrote that the European Council's decisions in
October and December had set the stage for turning this year's
short-term crisis management into a permanent system of
stabilisation next year.
 Such a system should also involve private creditors, he
added. ""It is also clear that a permanent crisis management
mechanism doesn't just assume the solidarity of all euro member
states but also must include a contribution from creditors in
case of restructuring.""
 That would prove the euro as a stable international
currency, he said.
 ""Most of all it will convince the international financial
world that the euro remains a long-term stable currency that
the entire world depends on, not least because the real
problems in other parts of the world are by no means smaller
than those in Europe.""

stress Germany's commitment to the euro in her New Year message
to the country on Friday.
 ""Europe stands, in these months, in the middle of a great
test. We must strengthen the euro. It's not just about our
money. The euro is far more than a currency,"" Merkel will tell

 ""The euro is the foundation of our prosperity. Germany needs
Europe and our common currency. For our own well-being and in
order to overcome great worldwide challenges. We Germans assume
our responsibility, even when it is sometimes very hard.""
 The chancellor has come under fire in other parts of Europe
for her stance on the sovereign debt crisis that has led to
emergency rescues of Greece and Ireland. Critics accused her of
stoking market panic by demanding that investors accept losses
on government debt in the event of a country defaulting.
 Some commentators have speculated Germany may eventually
lose patience with bailing out more profligate members of the
euro zone, leading to a break-up of the currency bloc.
 Although the weaker euro has been a blessing for Germany's
exporters, a poll this week by leading tabloid Bild showed every
other German wanted the deutschemark back, a symbol that stood
like no other for the post-war ""economic miracle"".
 Bundesbank figures from this month show Germans continue to
hoard old notes and coins worth some 6.9 billion euros ($9.1
billion), even though they can be exchanged at no cost in any of
the central bank's 47 branches across the country.
 According to a survey conducted by state-owned television
station ZDF and published on Dec. 17, only one-third of Germans
are in favour of providing greater financial support to indebted
euro zone countries.

 * Bond prices slip on upbeat U.S. economic data
(Updates to close)
 By Ka Yan Ng
 TORONTO, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar closed exactly
at par with the U.S. dollar for the first time in seven weeks
on Thursday in quiet trade, supported by an upbeat long-term
outlook for the U.S. economy.
 Despite a retreating price of crude oil to below $90 a
barrel, the commodity-influenced Canadian dollar stayed close
to parity with the greenback on Thursday, as it has all week.
 It was the first time since Nov. 10 that the Canadian
dollar closed at par, up slightly from C$1.0006 to the U.S.
dollar, or 99.94 U.S. cents, at Wednesday's close.
 The Canadian dollar has reached a one-for-one footing with
the U.S. currency several times this year but has not
maintained that level for long.
 TD Securities said the currency's movements this week were
reminiscent of the beginning of November, when it spent about a
week testing parity before retreating toward C$1.03 to the U.S.
dollar.
 Slim trading volumes ahead of the New Year's holiday may
put the Canadian dollar in choppy conditions but, overall,
analysts expect the currency will hover around parity into
2011.
 ""We may tomorrow see some end-of-year portfolio balancing
which might provide some volatility. But, overall, traders are
still expecting to see minor movement for the remainder of
2010,"" said Darren Richardson, corporate dealer at
CanadianForex.
 Thursday's North American trading range was a scant 28
ticks, between C$0.9995 and C$1.0023 to the U.S. dollar.
 Mounting confidence about the U.S. economy should help
support the currency because Canada's export-oriented economy
is closely tied to the health of the United States.
 Upbeat data on the U.S. jobs market and manufacturing
sector on Thursday helped support the view that the U.S.
economy gained momentum as the year ended, setting the stage
for a stronger performance in 2011. [ID:nN3097646]
 The data helped push Canadian government bond prices lower,
with the two-year bond  down 3 Canadian cents to
yield 1.709 percent. The 10-year bond  was off 4
Canadian cents to yield 3.166 percent. Canadian government debt
put in a mixed performance against U.S. Treasuries.

 * Dollars now available only at 4.3 and 5.3 rates
(Adds details)
 By Andrew Cawthorne and Mario Naranjo
 CARACAS, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Venezuela said on Thursday it
was abolishing the lowest exchange rate of 2.6 bolivars to the
dollar in a measure effectively devaluing the South American
OPEC nation's currency for a second time in 12 months.
 Economists had been forecasting such a measure, saying
President Hugo Chavez would want to take the political pain as
long before the December 2012 presidential election as
possible. The socialist leader plans to seek re-election.
 ""Politically, it's the right thing to do. They are
devaluing now so as to avoid it in 2012 and take the
inflationary hit in 2011,"" said local analyst Miguel Octavio,
of BBO financial services.
 ""It's brutal for the ordinary Venezuelan because it will
affect food and medicine prices.""
 From Jan. 1, dollars would only be available at the
state-controlled rates of 4.3 bolivars for some preferential
goods and 5.3 bolivars to the dollar via the Central Bank's
SITME exchange system, officials said.
 ""The 2.6 rate is being eliminated,"" Central Bank President
Nelson Merentes told Reuters. Essential imports such as
medicines and some foods had been available at the 2.6 rate,
accounting for about 30 percent of all forex transactions.
 The bolivar had been devalued in January of this year,
adding to annual inflation estimated at 26.9 percent.
 While the devaluation will add to price pressure in
Venezuela, which already has one of the world's highest
inflation rates, it should also help government coffers and
that is likely to please bond-holders.
 Venezuela's benchmark 2027 global bond  is one
of the most highly traded in the world due to its high yield
and volatility on perceived risk.
 Chavez's currency controls have spawned an illegal black
market where the bolivar trades at about 8 to the dollar.
 Earlier on Thursday, the government announced the economy
had shrunk an estimated 1.9 percent in 2010, the second year of
recession for Venezuela. [ID:nN30257954]

"
1051,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2010 02:24PM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Venezuela's bolivar currency devaluation," Dec 30 (Reuters) - Venezuela said on Thursday it was
abolishing the lowest exchange rate of 2.6 bolivars per U.S.
dollar in a measure that effectively devalued the South
American country's currency for the second time this year.
 Starting Jan. 1, dollars would only be available at the
state-controlled rates of 4.6 bolivars for some preferential
goods and 5.3 bolivars via the Central Bank's SITME exchange
system, officials said.
 Following are some facts about the bolivar under left-wing
President Hugo Chavez. For more, see: [ID:nN30109990]
 * In January, Chavez's government devalued the bolivar
currency, setting two rates of 2.6 and 4.3 against the dollar.
 * Chavez introduced currency controls in 2003 in a bid to
prevent capital flight during a period of political turmoil in
the South American oil-exporter. He fixed the bolivar at 1,600
to the dollar and put restrictions on foreign currency
purchases.
 * Thursday's devaluation was the fourth since then, with
the bolivar dropping to 1,920/dollar in 2004 and 2,150 in 2005.
In 2008, the government lopped three zeros from the currency
and issued new bills and coins.
 * The currency in Venezuela's oil-dominated economy has a
recent history of instability. Financial turmoil in the 1990s
led to rapid loss in value, with bands, fixed rates and a free
float all unsuccessful in stopping the decline.
 * The bolivar's weakening has been tied to soaring
inflation, which peaked at 103 percent in 1996 when the
government of former President Rafael Caldera lifted price and
foreign exchange controls. Inflation in 2009 was 25.1 percent,
the highest rate in the Americas.
 * The bolivar is also traded on an informal market. On that
market a dollar costs about eight bolivars.
 * The complicated exchange system is confusing to
outsiders, but Venezuelans are experts at navigating multiple
rates. Those with access to dollars at the old official rate
have long been able to make a fast buck selling them again on
the informal market.
 * Critics of the system say it encourages corruption as
officials can offer access to the better of the rates.
 * During the 1970s, Venezuela's currency was one of the
strongest in the region, enabling its people to enjoy plenty of
foreign travel and shopping. Venezuelans were known, one joke
went, for always saying ""Dame dos!"" (Give me two!) when
stocking up on expensive goods in Miami during those days.
 * Those good times were partially repeated when oil prices
were high a few years back and travelers had easy access to the
2.15 rate.

 * Brazil's real adds 1 pct on month-end positioning
 * Mexican, Colombian pesos also set to beat real in 2010
 By Froilan Romero and Samantha Pearson
 SANTIAGO/SAO PAULO, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Chile's peso was set
to have gained the most among Latin America's major currencies
in 2010, after the surging price of copper pushed it to a fresh
31-month high on Thursday.
 Chile is the world's top producer of the red metal and has
been flooded with dollars as investors line up to buy one of
this year's most sought-after commodities. For details, see
[ID:nLDE6BS0C9].
 The Chilean peso  firmed 0.24 percent to 467.70 per
dollar on Thursday, closing the trading year 8.4 percent
stronger.
 ""The peso could approach 465 in the first few days of 2011,
but the market sees this as a critical level and after that it
could start to reverse and test 470,"" said one currency trader
in Santiago.
 Sharp gains by the Brazilian real  on Thursday,
mainly as a result of month-end positioning, made little
difference to its 2010 position as one of the year's
underperformers.
 The real was heading for gains of 4.7 percent over 2010,
compared with 5.7 percent for the Mexican peso and 5.8 percent
for the Colombian peso.
 The region's currencies were mainly moved by local factors
on Thursday as volumes remained extremely low.
 The Brazilian real bid 0.95 percent stronger at 1.662 reais
per U.S. dollar on the local spot market as a result of
positioning at the end of the month.
 Due to the way that a key reference rate (Ptax) is
calculated in Brazil's currency markets, traders often bid up
the real at the end of the month to secure better returns on
futures contracts.
 Colombia's peso  gained 0.31 percent to 1931 to the
dollar, continuing its correction after sharp losses.
 The peso plunged earlier this week due to a rare
combination of factors: a scarcity of dollars caused by central
bank intervention and a demand for greenbacks because of local
rules on positioning and end-of-year corporate demand. This was
then exacerbated by low volumes, causing huge swings in the
peso.
 The broadly weaker U.S. dollar also gave some support to
the region's currencies.
 ""The U.S. dollar extended its Wednesday losses after softer
bond yields prevailed following yesterday's successful auction
and light volume weighed on the dollar's tone,"" said analysts
at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York in a research note.
 The Mexican currency  weakened 0.18 percent to
12.3875 per dollar on Thursday, tracking U.S. stock markets.

1055,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2010 01:16PM ET</span>",SNAP ANALYSIS-Ex-tycoon's trial passes verdict on Russia leaders," * Doubt cast on Medvedev promises to boost rule of law
 * Questions over Medvedev's ability to modernise economy
 * Putin's rivalry with tycoon marked his presidency
 
 By Thomas Grove
 MOSCOW, Dec 30 (Reuters) - A court sentence on ex-oil tycoon
Mikhail Khodorkovsky will hurt Russia's international reputation
and endanger its relations with major trading partners, possibly
discouraging investment in an economy which needs modernising.
 Khodorkovsky, who fell out with the Kremlin, faces six more
years in jail after a judge sentenced him on Thursday for theft
and money-laundering in a ruling which German Chancellor Angela
Merkel said appeared to be politically motivated.
 The U.S. State Department said the case ""appears to be an
abusive use of the legal system for improper ends"" while a
senior Obama administration official said the sentencing would
complicate Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organization.
 The court's decision also passes a longer-lasting and
perhaps more fundamental verdict on the leadership of Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev.
 
 * The widely-expected sentence casts serious doubt on
Medvedev's promises to boost the rule of law and on his
will or power to reform state institutions as the emerging
economy hungrily seeks foreign investment.
 For analysts and investors alike, it undercuts any optimism
about progress on problems such as corruption, which Western
executives describe as the biggest barrier to doing business in
Russia. It may raise questions about Medvedev's ability to
follow through on a modernisation drive to diversify Russia's
economy away from oil and gas and toward high-tech investment.
 Medvedev, steered into the presidency by his predecessor
Putin in 2008, has made a range of promises to remedy problems
facing the country, although he has yet to make much headway on
fulfilling any of them. Putin and Medvedev say they share the
same goals for Russia, but Medvedev has emphasised
modernisation, the rule of law and civil society.
 
 * The sentence may have implications for relations with the
European Union, Russia's largest trade partner.
 The British Foreign Office voiced concerns earlier this week
about the need for a transparent judicial system for UK
investors in Russia, possibly threatening bilateral trade, which
is expected to be around $10 billion in 2010.
 UK companies accounted for $19.4 billion of the $262.6
billion in investment that Russia has attracted since the 1991
Soviet collapse, making Britain the country's fifth largest
investor. Prime Minister David Cameron is due to visit Russia
in 2011.
 
 * Khodorkovsky's sentence has the potential to damage newly
strengthened ties with the United States. Earlier comments on
the case from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the White
House caused Russia to fire back a tersely-worded statement this
week, telling the West that it should mind its own business and
stop meddling in Russia's affairs.
 Medvedev and his U.S. counterpart Barack Obama have hailed a
""reset"" in relations, supported by the signing of a landmark
nuclear arms pact, after ties fell to a post Cold War low during
Russia's five-day war with pro-western Georgia in 2008.
 The Khodorkovsky sentence could give Russia critics in
Washington ammunition against further rapprochement with Moscow.
 
 * The sentence will be attributed to the will of Putin,
whose personal rivalry with the oil tycoon -- including
Khodorkovsky's 2003 arrest -- marked his 2000-2008 presidency.
 Kremlin critics cast Khodorkovsky's original 2005 conviction
as retribution for publicly challenging Putin on issues
including corruption, and for using his massive oil revenues to
fund opposition groups.
 Putin, who is widely seen as Russia's top decision maker,
often weighed in on the Khodorkovsky case during the recent
trial while Medvedev refrained from commenting, leaving analysts
to ponder the president's ability to make decisions on important
issues.
 
 * Analysts say the decision provides few clues about whether
Medvedev or Putin will run for president in 2012, but it
suggests Putin will retain ultimate power in either case.
 It also sidelines Khodorkovsky, who became a prominent Putin
critic and had previously shown political ambition, for
parliamentary elections late in 2011 and the 2012 presidential
vote. Both Putin or Medvedev have hinted they may run for
president but said they will decide together which of the two
will stand.
 
 * Although unlikely, the sentence does not rule out a pardon
by Medvedev, which would be the boldest move of his presidential
career. This would show yet unseen ambition from a leader who
most Russians believe is happy to play second fiddle to Putin.

 * Dollar rebounds vs yen as data bolsters recovery hopes
 * Australian dollar climbs to 28-year high
(Updates prices, adds comment, details)
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Dec 30 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc hit record
highs against the euro and dollar on Thursday and looked set to
extend gains in the new year as investors sought safety amid
persistent concerns about the euro zone debt crisis.
 The dollar rebounded from a seven-week low against the yen
after a string of strong-than-expected data bolstered optimism
about the U.S. economy and lifted U.S. bond yields. Higher
yields make dollar-denominated assets more attractive.
 The euro fell as low as 1.2398 Swiss francs on trading
platform EBS and was on track to post a record loss of about 16
percent this year. The U.S. dollar is heading for a decline
against the Swiss franc this year of about 10 percent.
 ""Euro/Swiss franc has dropped to a new low in tandem with
dollar/franc highlighting the genuine strength of the Swiss
franc as opposed to simply weakness in either the dollar or
euro,"" said Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia
Capital in Toronto.
 ""We continue to be Swiss franc bulls, expecting that its
status as a European alternative to the euro, a strong
sovereign position and relatively solid fundamentals will
continue to (make) it an attractive home for investors,"" she
said.
 In midday trading, the euro fell 0.6 percent to 1.2435
francs. The dollar dropped 0.9 percent to 0.9376 francs, after
having hit a session trough of 0.9365 on EBS.
 Swiss implied volatilities ticked higher with the one-month
dollar/Swiss franc trading at around 11.80 percent, a level
last seen in mid-November.
 Against the U.S. dollar, the euro climbed to a session peak
of $1.3315 on EBS after breaking above its 20-day moving
average around $1.3222. It last traded at $1.3261, up 0.3
percent on the day.
 Worries that the euro zone debt crisis may spread to Spain
and Portugal have many analysts bracing for more euro weakness
in early 2011, but the currency's stubborn refusal to break
below the 200-day moving average -- now at $1.3086 -- has
frustrated bearish investors.
 STRONGER US DATA
 The dollar earlier slipped as low as 81.28 yen on EBS --
its lowest in seven weeks -- edging closer to a 15-year low of
80.21 yen hit in November, after a surprisingly strong Treasury
auction on Wednesday put pressure on U.S. bond yields. But
it recovered to last trade 0.2 percent higher at 81.76 yen
after data showed U.S. initial jobless claims hit their lowest
level in more than two years last week and factory activity in
the Midwest grew in December at its fast pace since 1988.
 In a third report, the National Association of Realtors
said pending home sales rose 3.5 percent last month, the second
straight month of gains and beating market expectations for a 2
percent increase.
 ""The major theme is that the U.S. data keeps coming in
better than expected,"" said Mark McCormick, currency strategist
at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. ""It all fits with theme
that the U.S. economy is moving in the right direction, and
that is going to be supportive of the dollar and higher bond
yields in 2011.""
 Thinning liquidity ahead of the New Year's holiday likely
exaggerated price swings and analysts cautioned against reading
too much into the price action.
 In earlier trading, the Australian dollar hit a fresh
28-year high of $1.0198 against the U.S. dollar, though option
barriers at $1.0200 prevented further gains as it eased back to
$1.0113.

(Updates with European markets close)
 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Dec 30 (Reuters) - The dollar weakened broadly on
Thursday on expectations of low bond yields continuing into
2011, while U.S. and European stocks gave back part of the
recent gains that had taken global equities close to Sept. 2008
highs.
 The Swiss franc soared to record highs against the dollar
and the euro as concerns about the European debt crisis
reinforced its safe-haven appeal among currency investors.
 U.S. stocks dipped in spite of a solid batch of economic
data as investors avoided taking on more risk before the new
year. Still, the S&P 500 appeared headed for its best December
in nearly two decades and a MSCI index of global stocks
remained close to Sept. 2008 highs.
 ""There may be more upside, and some more money printing.
Companies are in good shape with lots of cash .... but you
can't just buy and hold,"" said Giuseppe-Guido Amato, strategist
at Lang & Schwarz in Germany.
 ""There are still the systemic risks of the euro zone
sovereign debt crisis.""
 Highlighting concerns about the euro zone debt crisis,
Italy sold 8.1 billion euros ($10.7 billion) of medium and
long-term debt but missed the top end of its targeted range for
8.5 billion euros and had to pay higher yields to investors.
 European sovereign debt concerns pushed the euro down to
1.2398 francs  on trading platform EBS after a
Swiss bank targeted an option barrier at 1.2400. It last traded
at 1.2461, down 0.3 percent.
 The dollar was down 0.19 percent against a basket of major
currencies, according to the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>. The euro
gained 0.33 percent against the greenback to $1.3267.
 The dollar has been weakening since a surprisingly strong
Treasury auction on Wednesday put pressure on government bond
yields. Treasuries yields were modestly higher on Thursday due
to stronger-than-expected economic data, but investors expect
them to remain under pressure in 2011 as the U.S. Federal
Reserve maintains its ultra-loose monetary policy.
 Against the Swiss franc the dollar fell to 0.9371 francs
 on EBS as the euro/Swiss barrier gave way. It was
last at 0.9392, down 0.7 percent on the day.
 ""We continue to be Swiss franc bulls, expecting that its
status as a European alternative to the euro, a strong
sovereign position and relatively solid fundamentals will
continue to make it an attractive home for investors,"" said
Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital in
Toronto.
 Thinning liquidity ahead of the New Year's holiday likely
exaggerated price swings in currency markets, traders said.
 STOCKS TREADING WATER
 U.S. stocks traded flat to lower as the thin liquidity
discouraged investors from making big bets.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 8.86
points, or 0.08 percent, at 11,576.52, while the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> dipped 0.97 points, or 0.08 percent, to
1,258.81. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> edged lower 1.78
points, or 0.07 percent, at 2,665.15.
 That weak performance came despite positive economic data,
including a government report that showed new U.S. claims for
unemployment benefits dropped 34,000 to a seasonally adjusted
388,000, the lowest reading since early July 2008. For details,
see [ID:nN30280758].
 Another report showed activity in the U.S. Midwest jumped
unexpectedly in December, with help from a gain in employment
and new orders. And pending sales of previously owned U.S.
homes rose faster than expected in November, though sales
remained below ""normal."" [ID:nN3095591] [ID:nN30100234]
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index closed down
1.26 percent, its largest one-day retreat this month. Still,
the index is on track to post its biggest monthly gain since
March. Thursday was the last trading day of the year inseveral
European countries, including Germany, Spain and Italy.
 The benchmark MSCI All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS>
was practically flat, near Wednesday's close of 330.90, which
was the highest since Sept. 2008.
 A weaker dollar boosted pushed silver to new 30-year highs
while palladium neared its highest in almost ten years, but
gold prices  fell 0.33 percent to $1,405.90 an ounce
after the positive U.S. economic data.
 The data also reduced the safe-haven appeal of U.S.
government debt. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note
 was down 12/32 in price, with the yield at 3.4036
percent, up from 3.36 percent late Wednesday.

(Adds Poland pension reform, Czech deficit, updates markets)
 By Marton Dunai and Dagmara Leszkowicz
 BUDAPEST/WARSAW, Dec 30 (Reuters) - The Czech crown was the
top performing currency in emerging Europe on the last full
trading day of the year, punctuating a strong performance in
2010 that reflected confidence in the republic's fiscal and
economic position.
 The crown added a third of a percent by 1529 GMT on Thursday
as the Finance Minister said the government was on course to
meet its 2010 deficit target and that it could even come in
slightly below the government's aim of 163 billion crowns.
 The Polish zloty held steady near a one-month high helped by
state-owned BGK bank converting euros into the local currency,
but Polish bonds weakened a shade on the longer end after the
government unveiled a pension reform proposal.
 Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk unveiled plans to cut
employees' contributions to mandatory private pension funds to
2.3 percent of their monthly salaries from 7.3 percent at
present to help shore up budget finances.
 BGK bank is authorised to convert euros for zlotys on behalf
of the finance ministry, which needs to exchange European Union
funds. The bank's presence in the market also has a
psychological impact in supporting the zloty, dealers said.
 ""BGK is likely to rule in the market until the end of the
year,"" said one Warsaw-based dealer. ""The local support level is
3.96.""
 Meanwhile, the Hungarian forint slipped 0.2 percent on the
day against the euro as the country's assets continued to feel
the effects of two recent ratings downgrades.
 The forint also suffered against the global safe haven Swiss
franc, whose strength pushed the CHF/HUF pair near the all-time
high of 226.36 in intraday trading. The strength of the franc,
the main funding unit for Hungary's foreign currency loans,
hurts the hundreds of thousands of Hungarian households who have
taken out franc-denominated debt.
 The Romanian leu was flat.
 
 HUNGARIAN YIELDS RISE
 The Czech crown is the top gainer in the region this year,
having added 4.4 percent, followed by the zloty, which is also
backed by strong economic fundamentals and which has gained 3.5
percent in 2010.
 The forint and the leu have slipped 3.2 percent and 1.1
percent, respectively, in 2010 amid political tension and
uncertainty over their fiscal outlooks.
 Data from the National Bank of Hungary showed the country's
current account surplus stood at 477 million euros in the third
quarter, more than analysts' forecasts.
 Hungary was forced to pay yields up to a quarter of a
percent above recent levels as it sold 45 billion forints worth
of bonds at the year's last auction, as planned.
 Poland said it would sell 12-18 billion zlotys worth of
treasury bills at 12 auctions in the first quarter.
 Both countries' bond markets were quiet at the end of the
year, although longer-maturity Polish bond yields rose about 3
basis points after the pension reform announcement.

 NEW YORK, Dec 30 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc hit record
highs versus the euro and dollar on Thursday and looked set to
extend gains as lower U.S. bond yields and concern about the
euro-zone debt crisis prompted investors to seek safety in the
Swiss currency.
 The dollar weakened broadly, hitting a seven-week low
against the yen and a 28-year low against the Australian dollar
after a surprisingly strong Treasury auction on Wednesday put
pressure on government bond yields.
 The euro briefly climbed above $1.33 after breaking above
its 20-day moving average around $1.3224, though gains were
limited amid worries about debt troubles in Portugal and
Spain.
 ""Euro/Swiss franc has dropped to a new low in tandem with
dollar/franc highlighting the genuine strength of the Swiss
franc as opposed to simply weakness in either the dollar or
euro,"" said Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia
Capital in Toronto.
 ""We continue to be Swiss franc bulls, expecting that its
status as a European alternative to the euro, a strong
sovereign position and relatively solid fundamentals will
continue to (make) it an attractive home for investors,"" she
said.
 The euro fell as low as 1.2398 francs on trading platform
EBS after a Swiss bank targeted an option barrier at 1.2400. It
last traded at 1.2497, down 0.1 percent.
 The dollar fell to 0.9371 francs on EBS as the euro/Swiss
barrier gave way. It was last at 0.9399, down 0.6 percent on
the day.
 Swiss implied volatilities ticked higher with the one-month
dollar/Swiss franc trading around 11.80 percent, a level last
seen in the middle of November.
 Thinning liquidity ahead of the New Year's holiday likely
exaggerated price swings, traders said.
 Currency trading ""remains highly subdued in the prevailing
holiday market, and this cautions against reading too much into
the price action,"" said UBS analysts in a note to clients.
 The euro climbed as high as $1.3301. The currency's refusal
to convincingly break below its 200-day moving average, now at
$1.3086, has frustrated bearish investors.
 The dollar slipped as low as 81.28 yen on EBS, its lowest
in seven weeks and edging closer to a 15-year low of 80.21 yen
hit in November. It later recovered to 81.49, still down 0.2
percent on the day.
 The dollar briefly trimmed losses versus the yen after data
showed new U.S. claims for unemployment benefits dropped more
than expected last week, bolstering hopes the labor market
recovery was gaining strength. See
 The Australian dollar hit a fresh 28-year high of $1.0198
against the U.S. dollar, though option barriers at $1.0200
prevented further gains as it eased back to $1.0169.

 * Sees benefits from membership despite euro crisis
 * Other Baltic states hope to adopt euro in 2014
 
 By David Mardiste
 TALLINN, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Policymakers will gather in the
historic capital of Estonia to welcome the Baltic state as the
euro zone's newest member when the old year ends, offering a
small cause for celebration to an otherwise gloomy currency
bloc.
 European Monetary Affairs Commissioner Ollie Rehn and the
prime ministers of Latvia and Lithuania meet in Tallinn on
Friday to hail Estonia's euro entry from midnight, capping a
drive for integration with the West and away from the influence
of Russia that began with the collapse of the Soviet Union.
 It also brings the euro to a former Soviet state for the
first time. Neighbours Latvia and Lithuania hope to join in
2014.
 All three Baltic nations went through Soviet, Nazi and then
Soviet occupation again, so becoming part of western economic
and security structures has been of prime importance to cement
the independence they gained 1991.
 They joined NATO and a self-confident European Union in
2004.
 The timing of Estonia's latest entry into a western club in
which it will be the 17th and poorest member -- albeit with the
second lowest budget deficit and the lowest level of state debt
-- might be considered less fortunate.
 But Estonian leaders have brushed off concerns the project
might backfire as euro zone policymakers pursue efforts to
contain a debt crisis that has left the single currency facing
an uncertain future.
 ""The euro area debt problems are not caused by the euro and
the ongoing economic crisis. The seeds of the problems were sown
decades ago,"" President Toomas Ilves said in a recent speech.
 ""Therefore the solving of the current problems make the euro
only stronger and Estonia has the opportunity to be immediately
involved in this process.""
 Prime Minister Andrus Ansip is set to be one of the first to
take euros out of a cash machine set up specially for the event,
and the head of central bank will give a television address
shortly before midnight on December 31.
 In economic terms, the single currency bloc will barely
notice the addition -- Estonia's gross domestic product is just
0.2 percent of the current euro zone's 8.9 trillion euros.
 Estonia also sees the shift to the euro as bringing little
change to monetary policy -- its kroon has for 18 years been
pegged to the euro under a tight currency board and will be
converted at a rate of 15.6466. The Latvian and Lithuanian
currencies are also pegged to the euro.
 Looking beyond the single currency zone's woes, the whole
Baltic region is hoping euro membership will in time confer
greater political and economic stability after brutal recessions
in 2009.
 ""Over the longer term there are less risk of uncertainties
and instability in the euro area than in the Baltic region and
thus this should be positive for Estonia, despite the short-term
challenges,"" said Nordea analyst Annika Lindblad.

 * All Vatican departments will be affected
 * Pope approves internal financial watchdog
(Adds background on investigation of cardinal, para 9)
 By Philip Pullella
 VATICAN CITY, Dec 30 (Reuters) - The Vatican, whose bank is
the focus of a money laundering investigation, enacted laws on
Thursday to bring it in line with international standards on
financial transparency and the fight against funding terrorism.
 It was the biggest action ever taken by the Vatican to meet
demands for more financial openness. It establishes an internal
watchdog, known as a Financial Information Authority (FIA), to
check compliance with international financial law.
 Pope Benedict signed a ""Motu Proprio"", a form of executive
order, in which the Vatican establishes a set of internal laws
promising its bank and all other departments will adhere to
regulations and cooperate with foreign authorities.
 ""The Vatican now is totally inserted into this system in
solidarity with the international community and with
international authorities,"" spokesman Father Federico Lombardi
said.
 The new laws aim to make the Vatican City, a 108-acre
sovereign state surrounded by Rome, comply with the rules of the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a Paris-based body that
lists states failing to comply with standards on money
laundering and terrorism financing.
 By adopting the new laws, including establishing the FIA
along the lines of those in other countries, the Vatican commits
itself to complying with FATF standards and liaise with the
group and law enforcement agencies.
 The new laws, about 30 pages long and consisting of more
than 50 articles, will take effect by April 1.
 They affect all Vatican departments. This means offices such
as its missionary arm, which handles tens of millions of dollars
a year, will be subject to stringent regulations and oversight.
 Last June, Italian magistrates began an investigation of
Cardinal Crescenzio Sepe, former head of the missionary arm, on
suspicion of corruption in the sale of a building in Rome owned
by the department. He has denied all wrongdoing.
 Vatican employees suspected of violating the norms will be
investigated by its FIA and judged by Vatican tribunals, but
would serve any prison time in Italian jails, in accordance with
standing agreements between Italy and the Vatican. Money
laundering would be punishable by up to 12 years in prison.
 Lombardi said the laws would make Vatican institutions less
vulnerable to misuse and make the Catholic Church ""more credible
before the members of the international community"".
 
 MONEY LAUNDERING
 The Vatican Bank, founded in 1942 by Pope Pius XII, was in
the spotlight in September when Italian investigators froze 23
million euros' worth of funds in Italian banks after they opened
an investigation into possible money laundering.
 The bank, officially known as the Institute for Religious
Works (IOR), says it did nothing wrong and was just transferring
funds between its own accounts..
 A statement said the new laws, drafted with help from the
European Union, Italy and the European Central Bank, stressed
the bank's ""firm intention to cooperate according to principles
and criteria which are internationally recognised"".
 The Vatican hopes it can secure an entry in the Organisation
for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) ""White List""
of states complying with international banking standards.
 The Vatican also committed itself to combating terrorism,
market rigging, insider trading, counterfeiting and forgery.
 The IOR mainly manages funds for the Vatican and religious
institutions around the world, such as charities, religious
orders of priests and nuns, and Catholic hospitals.
 In 1982 it was caught up in the fraudulent bankruptcy of
Banco Ambrosiano, then Italy's largest private bank, whose
president Roberto Calvi was found hanged under London's
Blackfriars Bridge.
 Several investigations failed to determine whether Calvi,
known as God's Banker, killed himself or was murdered. The
Vatican denied any responsibility for the collapse of the Banco
Ambrosiano, in which it held a small stake, but made a ""goodwill
payment"" of $250 million to creditors.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Dec 30 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc hit record highs
versus the euro and the dollar on Thursday, bolstered by its
safe-haven status and lower U.S. bond yields in thin year-end
trade that exaggerated price swings.
 The dollar weakened broadly, hitting a seven-week low
against the yen and a 28-year low against the Australian dollar
as traders took the falls in U.S. bond yields as a cue to sell.
 U.S. Treasury prices recovered on Wednesday, pushing yields
sharply lower, after a $29 billion auction of seven-year notes
drew surprisingly strong demand. [ID:nN29284358]. 
 The euro continues to smart from concerns over debt
financing in the currency bloc's peripheral countries, giving
investors cause to seek the relative safety of the Swiss
currency.
 ""The franc is a hedging vehicle for euro zone risk and we
need some degree of resolution to concerns about credit risk in
the euro zone periphery to stop it grinding higher,"" said Ray
Farris, currency strategist at Credit Suisse.
 ""The dollar is a weak currency and it will continue to
weaken against those currencies that aren't actively trying to
disqualify themselves from being an alternative to the dollar,
which right now includes the Swiss,"" he said.
 The euro fell as low as 1.2398 francs  after a
Swiss bank targeted an option barrier at 1.2400, before bouncing
back to trade at 1.2434, down 0.6 percent on the day.
 The dollar fell to 0.9371 francs  as the euro/Swiss
barrier gave way. It was last at 0.9381, sitting with losses of
0.8 percent on the day. Swiss implied volatilities ticked higher
with the one-month dollar/Swiss franc  trading around
11.80 percent, a level last seen in the middle of November.
 The moves came in a thin market with many players sidelined
until the new year.
 ""FX trading activity remains highly subdued in the
prevailing holiday market, and this cautions against reading too
much into the price action,"" said UBS analysts in a note to
clients.
 The euro climbed to $1.3260  after refusing to break
below its 200-day moving average, now at $1.3086, frustrating
bearish investors who think Portugal and possibly Spain could be
the next to be bailed out in the new year.
 Italy placed most of its planned issue of bonds at a tender
on Thursday, although it cut the final sales of two papers and
was forced to accept broadly higher yields. [ID:nMAT012394]
 
 DOLLAR/YEN NEAR 7-WEEK LOW
 The dollar slipped as low as 81.28 yen  in Asia, its
lowest in seven weeks and edging closer to a 15-year low of
80.21 yen hit in November. It later recovered to 81.42, still
down 0.3 percent on the day.
 Traders now await weekly U.S. jobless claims report, Chicago
PMI numbers and pending home sales for November later in the
session. Any signs of further deterioration in the U.S. housing
sector, where foreclosures jumped in the third quarter, could
see the dollar come under more pressure.
 Traders said a rise in the Chinese yuan after China's
interest rate hike last Saturday was supporting Asian
currencies, including the yen.
 The yuan  hit a record high against the dollar on
Thursday after the Chinese central bank set the yuan mid-point
 versus the dollar at a record high. Chinese President
Hu Jintao visits the United States on Jan. 19 for a summit in
which the subject of the undervalued yuan is likely to loom
large. [ID:nTOE6BM01F]
 The Australian dollar hit a fresh 28-year high of $1.0198
 against the U.S. dollar, though option barriers at
$1.0200 prevented further gains as it eased back to $1.0169.

"
1074,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2010 08:04AM ET</span>",Q+A-How markets could react to Iran-India oil row?," Dec 30 (Reuters) - Officials from Iran and India will meet
on Friday for talks on a dispute over how India makes payments
for $12 billion worth of crude oil imports a year.
 The dispute escalated on Wednesday when Tehran refused to
sell oil to the world's fourth-biggest crude importer after New
Delhi imposed prohibitive new rules.
 Last week, the Reserve Bank of India said deals with Iran
must be settled outside a long-standing Asian Clearing Union
system.
 Iran is under global pressure over its nuclear programme,
and though United Nations sanctions do not forbid the purchase
of Iranian oil, the United States has pressed hard for
governments and companies to stop dealing with Tehran.
 UN sanctions on the financial sector make financing trade
and clearing payments difficult.
 Supply of around 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian
crude to state-owned refiners and privately owned Essar Oil in
India is at risk. This is the equivalent of about 13 percent of
the crude processed in India last month.
 
 IS IRAN LIKELY TO STOP SUPPLYING INDIA?
 Analysts and oil traders expect the two countries to resolve
the issue, given the large volume and value of the crude at
stake and the difficulties Indian refiners would face in finding
alternative supplies.
 ""They (the United States) have themselves not been willing
to sanction crude sales from Iran (to the international market)
for the obvious balance of supply and demand,"" said Samuel
Ciszuk at IHS Energy consultancy.
 ""However, informally they (the United States) have been
using financial sanctions as the main tool of pressure to cause
uncertainty and insecurity for Iran. They want to make sure no
one finds it easy to deal with Iran,"" he added.
 Oil traders in Asia also said they expected sales to resume
because a full suspension would be too costly for India.
 Indian refiners may have to explore alternative payment
methods such as open credit or barter trade, one trader said.
These are already used by some of Iran's oil trade partners.
 Ambika Sharma, deputy secretary general at the Federation of
Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said: ""The two central
banks could look at settling the trade transaction in a currency
other than the euro and the U.S. dollar""
 India has been one of the top three buyers of Iranian crudes
along with China and Japan, and Iran is the second-biggest
supplier of crude to India after Saudi Arabia. For a table on
India's crude oil imports from various countries since
2001/02-2009/10 see
 
 WHAT HAPPENS IF IRAN STOPS SUPPLYING INDIA?
 Spot prices for alternative crude on physical markets would
probably rise as Indian refiners search for suppliers to plug
the gap left by the shortfall from Iran.
 But prices for Iranian crude would probably fall as it looks
for new buyers or seeks to boost volumes to existing buyers.
 International crude futures could rise on concern that the
disruption would become more widespread and that other countries
could also struggle to find ways to make payments. Iran's other
main Asian buyers said on Thursday, however, they saw no
disruption in supply.
 If both sides find alternatives, the market impact is likely
to be shortlived once new trade patterns are established. The
total supply and demand of crude on international markets would
be unchanged.
 If Iran fails to find alternative buyers, oil prices would
rise until other oil producers plug the supply gap. India buys
about a fifth of Iran's 2 million barrels per day of exports.
That 400,000 bpd is around 0.5 percent of the global oil market.
 
 WHAT WOULD IRAN DO WITH OIL IT COULDN'T SELL?
 When Iran struggles to find buyers for oil, the country
typically stores crude on tankers, mainly very large crude
carriers (VLCCs). In the short term, Iran could use VLCCs and
fill oil tanks on land as it searches for new buyers.
 Iran was storing as much as 35 million barrels on VLCCs as
recently as April.
 In recent weeks Iranian crude estimated to be held in
floating storage has remained static at seven VLCCs, a shipping
source said. A VLCC can hold up to 2 million barrels of crude
oil. 
 Traders told Reuters late in October that the volume of
Iranian crude stored at sea had fallen by as much as 4 million
barrels because of a spike in Asian demand at that time.
 
 WHERE WOULD INDIA FIND ALTERNATIVE SUPPLIES?
 India could look for alternative suppliers in the Middle
East such as Iraq or Saudi Arabia or even further afield in West
Africa.
 In Iraq, a massive drive to overhaul ageing infrastructure
and operations is leading to the first supply increases at its
oilfields, although to date the volumes are small.
 Saudi Arabia has 4 million bpd of spare capacity and is the
only oil producer that could compensate for a sizeable
disruption of supply from regional rival Iran.
 But like Iran, it is a member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries and is constrained by the group's
supply agreements. It may be reluctant to step in to fill a
supply disruption left by a fellow OPEC member.
 India's Reliance Industries, which stopped buying Iranian
crudes this fiscal year beginning April 1, has turned its focus
to importing Latin American crudes. 
 India may step up imports of Latin American crude in coming
months after an annual 61 percent jump in the January-November
period.
 An Asian oil trader said private refiners could obtain
higher volumes on a sustained basis from South America,
particularly Venezuela.
 Essar Oil, which has reduced imports of Latin American
grades after getting local supplies, may shift back to South
American grades, while state refiners would prefer to tap
African crude, traders said.

 * For yuan/forex spot, fwds/swap trading and all businesses	
 * Sets minium requirements and gives more FX quotas	
 
 SHANGHAI, Dec 30 (Reuters) - China on Thursday published
its first set of formal guidelines governing market makers
trading the yuan against foreign currencies, dividing them
into three types and requiring a trial period before getting
such status.	
 Market makers will be divided into yuan/forex spot trading
market makers, those for forwards and swap trading and those
for all businesses, according to the guidelines published by
the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).	
 The new guidelines will take effect on Jan. 1, 2011, SAFE
said on its website (www.safe.gov.cn). Only banks can assume
the role of market makers.	
 China adopted a forex market maker system shortly after
the landmark revaluation of the yuan in July 2005,
but they have so far been governed by a set of provisional
rules promulgated in November 2005.	
 Eighteen Chinese and foreign banks have been approved as
comprehensive market makers, SAFE said on its website. They
include the China units of Citigroup , Standard Chartered
, HSBC and China's biggest four
state-owned banks.	
 A SAFE official said the new rules and addition of
different types of market makers would help boost trading in
forwards and swaps on the market, the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System, but declined to elaborate.	
 The addition of more types of market makers would make it
easier for smaller institutions to participate in specific
types of forex trading, even if they do not meet the
requirements for comprehensive market maker status, analysts
said.	
 Following are details of major provisions in the guidelines.	
 To be given approval for a trial period as a market maker:	
 * Have been a member of the market for at least two years.	
 * Capital adequacy ratio at least 8 percent in the latest
year.	
 * Have a SAFE forex settlement quota of $200 million or
more.	
 To become a market maker for spot or forwards/swap trading:	
 * At least two years of trial market maker experience	
 * Capital adequacy ratio at least 9 percent over the
lastest two years.	
 * Have a SAFE forex settlement quota of $500 million or
more.	
 To be made market maker for comprehensive trading:	
 * At least five years of market maker experiences	
 * Capital adequacy ratio at least 10 percent over the
latest two years or 11 percent in the last year.	
 * Have a SAFE forex settlement quota of $1 billion or more.	
 * Must have at least four dealers with licences from the
market, the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.

 LONDON, Dec 30 (Reuters) - World stocks approached their
highest level since September 2008 on Thursday on optimism about
global growth next year, while the dollar fell on expectations
of further money printing in 2011 by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
European shares bucked the rise in global equities, dipping
slightly as energy stocks fell, but U.S. stock index futures
 pointed to a steady open on Wall Street.
 Markets are focusing on growth prospects for China, and a
survey on Thursday showed the country's vast manufacturing
sector continued to expand towards the year-end although at a
slightly slower pace than in November. [ID:nBJA002395] 
 Expectations for increased demand from China and other
emerging economies pushed copper to a fresh record high at
$9,550 a tonne , and U.S. crude oil  hovered around
$91, not far off a two-year high.
 Underlying concern about the euro zone debt crisis continued
to weigh on markets, however, as Italy sold 8.1 billion euros
($10.7 billion) of medium and long-term debt but missed the top
end of its targeted range for 8.5 billion euros and had to pay
higher yields to investors.
 On the last trading day of 2010 for many Asian, European and
Latin American markets, including Japan and Germany, the MSCI
world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> edged up 0.14 percent, close
to Sept 2008 highs set in the previous session.
 ""There may be more upside, and some more money printing.
Companies are in good shape with lots of cash .... but you can't
just buy and hold,"" said Giuseppe-Guido Amato, strategist at
Lang & Schwarz in Germany.
 ""There are still the systemic risks of the euro zone
sovereign debt crisis."" 
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares <.FTEU3>
dropped 0.56 percent.
 World stocks have gained 10 percent this year, as investors
showed modest appetite for risk on growing signs that global
economic recovery would continue. Emerging market stocks
<.MSCIEF> have climbed 16 percent and European stocks <.FTEU3>
have added 9 percent this year.
 
 DOLLAR DOWN
 The dollar suffered from expectations the Fed's quantitative
easing programme would contribute to further currency weakness
next year. It hit a record low against the Swiss franc , a
28-year low against the Australian dollar  and a
seven-week low against the yen , though ongoing concerns
about euro zone debt tempered the U.S. currency's losses against
the euro .
 ""The dollar is a weak currency and it will continue to
weaken against those currencies that aren't actively trying to
disqualify themselves from being an alternative to the dollar,
which right now includes the Swiss (franc),"" said Ray Farris,
currency strategist at Credit Suisse. 
 The Chinese yuan  hit a record high against the
dollar since its revaluation in mid-June after the People's Bank
of China set a higher mid-point for the currency cross, sparking
expectations Beijing will allow the yuan to appreciate further
in the first quarter of 2011.
 A number of dealers in Shanghai said the yuan could gain
around 2 percent in the first three months of 2011 as China
needs to fight imported inflation and will face heightened
political pressure to let its currency strengthen.
[ID:nTOE6BT055]
 German government bond futures  rose 52 ticks,
helped by a strong seven-year U.S. Treasury note auction on
Wednesday and shrugging off modest demand for Italian debt at
auction on Thursday.
 ""This is the first (euro zone) auction that settles in the
new year and I think they will continue to be like this, with
moderate demand and big concessions,"" said Luca Jellinek, head
of European rate strategy at Credit Agricole.
 Copper prices continued to be driven higher by expectations
for restocking by top consumer China in the first quarter
although analysts said prices could stall near current levels
until after the holidays.
 A weak dollar boosted gold  to a three-week high at
$1,412.45 an ounce, putting it on course for its 10th
consecutive annual gain after a near 30 percent rally in 2010,
its strongest performance since 2007.
 Silver prices  shot to new 30-year peaks at $30.88 an
ounce, benefiting from strength in other industrial commodities.
Silver is now poised for an 83 percent gain this year, its best
performance in nearly three decades.

more appreciation in the first quarter of next year.	
 Spot yuan hit an intraday high of
6.6000, the highest level since its revaluation and
accompanying forex reforms in July 2005. That was up 0.3
percent from Wednesday's close, the biggest daily percent rise
in around seven weeks.
The yuan has now risen 1.2 percent from a low 
hit on Dec. 20, marking one of its fastest series of gains
since the currency was depegged from the dollar in mid-June.
It has now gained 3.4 percent since the depegging.	
 The PBOC set the tone for the strong day by fixing the
day's mid-point against the dollar, from which the
yuan can rise or fall 0.5 percent in a given day, at a record
high of 6.6229 .	
 A number of dealers said they expected the yuan might rise
by around 2 percent in the first quarter of 2011 as China
needs to fight imported inflation and will face heightened
political pressure for it to strengthen.	
 ""The domestic economic situation of this year may carry on
into the first quarter of next year,"" said a dealer at an
Asian bank in Shanghai. ""So we expect the yuan may rise a
little more at that time.""	
 Dealers see the currency's gains quickening ahead of the
visit by Chinese President Hu Jintao to the United States in
mid-January. As for all of 2011, the yuan's appreciation will
still be measured and intermittent, traders say.	
 Sheng Songcheng, head of the statistics department at the
PBOC, said in comments published on Thursday that a gradual
and modest appreciation of the yuan would be good for China's
economy and has not hurt Chinese exporters. [ID:nTOE6BT004]	
 But Liu Dongliang, senior currency strategist at China
Merchants Bank in Shenzhen, said that China's inflation for
now was mainly affected by its own food prices.	
 With the international influence not so obvious, the
impact of yuan appreciation on curbing domestic inflation
would be limited in the short-term, Liu said.	
 The central bank appeared reluctant to let the yuan rise
too fast, amid the threat of speculative capital inflows
seeking returns on higher interest rates and expectations of a
further yuan rise.	
 Offshore, one-year non-deliverable dollar/yuan forwards
were bid at 6.4560 late on Thursday,
down slightly from Wednesday's close of 6.4730. The implied
yuan appreciation in a year's time edged higher to 2.59
percent from 2.32 percent.	
 Traders said offshore forwards had lagged in
response to the latest signs of yuan appreciation, due mainly
to thin holiday trading, but they might in coming weeks
increasingly imply greater appreciation over the next year.

 * Dollar weakens broadly on pullback in U.S. yields
 * Moves coming in thin year-end trade

(Changes dateline, adds quote, previous TOKYO)
 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Dec 30 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc hit record highs
versus the euro and the dollar on Thursday, underpinned by its
safe haven status and lower U.S. bond yields, though traders
cautioned that the move was coming in thin year-end trade.
 The dollar weakened broadly, hitting a seven-week low
against the yen and a 28-year low against the Australian
currency as traders took falls in U.S. bond yields as a cue to
sell. 
 U.S. Treasury prices recovered on Wednesday, pushing yields
sharply lower, after a $29 billion auction of seven-year notes
drew surprisingly strong demand a day after a weak five-year
sale. 
 As the euro, a natural alternative for the dollar, is
smarting from concerns over debt financing of the currency
bloc's peripheral countries, investors are looking for
alternatives.
 ""The franc is a hedging vehicle for euro zone risk and we
need some degree of resolution to concerns about credit risk in
the euro zone periphery to stop it grinding higher."" said Ray
Farris, currency strategist at Credit Suisse.
 ""The dollar is a weak currency and it will continue to
weaken against those currencies that aren't actively trying to
disqualify themselves from being an alternative to the dollar,
which right now includes the Swiss,"" he said.
 The euro fell as low as 1.2398 francs after a Swiss bank
targeted an option barrier at 1.2400. The dollar fell to 0.9371
francs as the euro/Swiss barrier gave way.
 But the moves came in a thin market with many players
sidelined until the new year.
 ""FX trading activity remains highly subdued in the
prevailing holiday market, and this cautions against reading too
much into the price action,"" said UBS analysts in a note to
clients.
 The euro extended gains to $1.3259 after a stubborn refusal
to break below its 200-day moving average, now at $1.3086,
frustrating bearish investors who think Spain and Portugal could
be the next to be bailed out in the new year.
 
 DOLLAR/YEN SLIDES
 The dollar slipped as low as 81.28 yen, its lowest in seven
weeks and edging closer to a 15-year low of 80.21 yen hit in
November. Traders cited Japanese yen repatriation flows at the
Tokyo fixing, adding importers were the main buyers of the
dollar around the lows.
 Traders said a rise in the Chinese yuan after China's
interest rate hike last Saturday was supporting Asian
currencies, including the yen.
 The yuan hit a record high against the dollar on Thursday
after the Chinese central bank set the yuan mid-point versus the
dollar at a record high.
 ""There will be speculation that China may engineer a higher
yuan ahead of Chinese President Hu Jintao's state visit to the
United States next month,"" said Keiji Matsumoto, a strategist at
Nikko Cordial Securities. 
 Hu will visit Washington on Jan. 19.
 The Australian dollar hit a fresh 28-year high of $1.0198
against the U.S. dollar, though option barriers at $1.0200
prevented further gains.
 Rising commodity prices have boosted the Aussie and helped
investors shrug off fears that the rise in borrowing costs would
slow China's economy and thus dampen demand for Australian
exports. London Metal Exchange copper hit a record high.

(Adds quotes, details)
 By Ben Blanchard
 BEIJING, Dec 30 (Reuters) - China defended its export
controls on rare earth minerals on Thursday, saying that they
were in line with World Trade Organisation rules, after a
government move to slash export quotas on rare earths sparked
trade concerns.
 China, which produces about 97 percent of the global supply
of the metals used in the production of numerous high-tech
products, cut its export quota by 35 percent for the first half
of 2011 compared with a year earlier, saying it wanted to
conserve reserves.
 Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu reiterated at a regular
news briefing in Beijing that the quotas were necessary for
environmental protection.
 ""This accords with relevant WTO rules,"" she said. ""In the
future, China will continue to supply rare earths to the
international market and will take effective management steps
over their export in accordance with WTO rules.""
 The foreign ministry does not set China's policy on rare
earths.
 China has refused U.S. requests to end export restraints on
rare earths that have alarmed trade partners, and Washington
could complain to the WTO, which judges international trade
disputes, the U.S. Trade Representative office said last week.
[ID:nTOE6BR02A]
 The rare earths issue adds to the growing list of
trade-related disputes between China and the United States, which
has accused China of poorly enforcing intellectual property
rights and for its indigenous innovation policies that
discriminate against foreign companies.
 Prices have surged for rare earth minerals since the
authorities in Beijing slashed exports by 40 percent this summer.
 Beijing said the curbs were aimed at ensuring supplies for
Chinese clean energy companies it is trying to promote
internationally, but it has also said its dominance as a producer
should give it more control over global prices.
 A European Commission spokesman said the European Union had
noted the latest quota figures and expected China to respect
recent assurances of a guarantee of rare earth supplies to
Europe.
 Wind turbines and hybrid cars are among the biggest users of
rare earth minerals, a little-known class of 17 related elements
that analysts say are facing a global supply crunch as demand
swells. The minerals also are used in some weapons systems.
 U.S. makers of high-tech products such as Apple Inc's
 iPads and various Japanese companies have been
scrambling to secure reliable supplies of the minerals outside of
China as Beijing steadily reduces export allocations.
 Beijing has long insisted that other countries should share
the responsibility for developing rare earths.
 ""The international community has a joint responsibility to
ensure the supply of rare earths,"" Jiang said. ""Other nations
that have rare earth resources should proactively develop and
make use of them, to jointly shoulder responsibility for global
supplies.""
 China has cautioned that it had not decided on quotas for
the second half of the year.

 * Economist warns inflation could still hit double-digits	
 
 By Kevin Yao and Chen Aizhu	
 BEIJING, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Chinese inflation showed signs
of cresting in a manufacturing survey on Thursday, an early
indication that the government will be able to stick to its
course of gradual rather than aggressive monetary tightening.	
 An easing of price pressures could also cap this week's
jump in the yuan to a record high against the dollar, which
the central bank said had played an important role in taming
inflation.	
 HSBC's China Purchasing Mangers' Index fell to a three
month-low of 54.4 in December from 55.3 in November,
suggesting that the pace of business expansion in the
factories of the world's second-largest economy was moderating
but still strong.	
 The headline figure offers an early clue about the
direction of overall economic growth, but all eyes now are on
Chinese inflation, which is running at its fastest in more
than two years, and Beijing's policy response to price
pressures.	
 In that arena, the HSBC survey offered a modicum of relief.	
 The input cost sub-index fell to a three-month low of 72.3
from 80.8 in November, while the output cost sub-index edged
down to a four-month low. But both figures were still well in
expansionary territory, indicating that firms were passing
higher raw material costs onto their customers rather than
absorbing them and taking a hit on earnings.	
 ""Inflation rather than growth still remains the top policy
concern, despite the moderation in December's manufacturing
PMI reading,"" said Qu Hongbin, HSBC's chief economist for China.

 ""We expect Beijing to continue to rely on quantitative
tightening measures to curb inflation and counter the impact
of QE2 (U.S. monetary easing), while modest interest rate
hikes are also needed to anchor inflation expectations in the
coming months.""	
 The People's Bank of China raised benchmark interest rates
on Saturday for the second time in just over two months.
Analysts polled by Reuters expect it to raise rates twice more
in the first half of 2011. [ID:nL3E6ND0QB]	
 Consumer price inflation raced to a 28-month high of 5.1
percent in the year to November.	
 
 STRONGER YUAN	
 The yuan rose to a record of 6.613 against the dollar on
Thursday after a senior official from the central bank said
gradual appreciation would help curb inflation and rebalance
the economy.	
 China will continue to push forward reform of the exchange
rate mechanism, Sheng Songcheng, head of the central bank's
statistics department, told the Financial News, an official
newspaper.	
 ""The positive impacts of China's yuan reform on the
domestic economy have significantly outweighed negative
impacts,"" Sheng said. [ID:nTOE6BT004]	
 The yuan has gained just over 3 percent since
its depegging from the dollar in June. But in the past two
weeks alone, it has jumped 1 percent and traders think it is
set for a new leg of measured gains. 
 The appreciation of the past half year had dragged down
domestic inflation by around one percentage point, Sheng said.	
 He also said a survey of 5,000 manufacturers and 2,100
exporters had found that a stronger yuan was essential to
rebalancing the economy toward greater reliance on domestic
demand, a top objective of China's leaders.	
 ""If we allow the yuan to appreciate 3 percent a year
against the dollar, it can boost imports by 0.3 percent,
reduce exports by 0.6 percent and cut the trade surplus by 6
percent,"" he said.	
 
 HAWKISH CENTRAL BANK	
 An informal poll of China-based dealers over the last week
showed that many expect the yuan to gain roughly 6 percent
next year, hitting 6.25 per dollar in late 2011, as the
exchange rate plays an increasing role in the battle against
inflation. [ID:nTOE6BQ01Y]	
 The central bank is more hawkish than other state agencies
on inflation, but it lacks policy independence when it comes
to key decisions on interest rates and the yuan.	
 If inflation is indeed nearing a peak, then the central
bank's push for heftier appreciation could soon run out of
steam.	
 Nevertheless, Gao Shanwen, chief economist at China
Essence Securities, warned that inflation could come unhinged
next year if growth takes off.	
 ""Inflation has hit 5 percent even though the economy is not
overheating. We can imagine that inflation could easily shoot
up to double-digits in a short span of time once China's
economy becomes overheated,"" Gao was cited as saying by local
media.	
 China will report its official PMI for December on
Saturday, Jan 1.	
 Economists polled by Reuters forecast that it rose to a
median 55.5, an eight-month high, underlining that the
country's manufacturing sector is in robust shape.

 By Chen Yixin and Jason Subler	
 SHANGHAI, Dec 30 (Reuters) - The yuan hit a record high
against the dollar on Thursday after the People's
Bank of China set a higher mid-point, sparking expectation of
more yuan appreciation in the first quarter of 2011.	
 Spot yuan hit an intraday high of 6.6106
by midday, the highest level since its revaluation and
forex reforms in July 2005. That was up 0.2 percent from
Wednesday's close.
The PBOC set the day's mid-point
against the dollar, from which the yuan can rise or fall 0.5
percent in a given day, at a record high of 6.6229 ,
slightly strong er than Wednesday's
6.6247.
A number of dealers said they expected the yuan
might rise 1-2 percent in the first quarter of 2011 as China
needs to fight imported inflation and will face heightened
political pressure for it to strengthen.	
 ""The domestic economic situation of this year may carry on
into the first quarter of next year,"" said a dealer at an
Asian bank in Shanghai. ""So we expect the yuan may rise a
little more at that time.""	
 Dealers see the currency's gains quickening ahead of the

still be measured and intermittent, traders say.

impact of yuan appreciation on curbing domestic inflation
would be limited in the short-term, Liu said.

too fast, amid the threat of speculative capital inflows

 Offshore, one-year non-deliverable dollar/yuan forwards
were bid at 6.4630 at midday, down
slightly from Wednesday's close of 6.4730. The
implied yuan appreciation in a year's time edged higher to
2.47 percent from 2.32 percent.	
 Traders said offshore forwards had lagged in
response to the latest signs of yuan appreciation, due mainly
to thin holiday trading, but they might in coming weeks
increasingly imply greater appreciation over the next year.

 By Randy Fabi	
 SINGAPORE, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Oil rose further above $91
on Thursday, ahead of U.S. weekly inventory data expected to
show a drawdown in crude stocks for the fourth consecutive
week due to an abnormally icy winter.	
 U.S. crude for February delivery  climbed 21 cents
to $91.33 a barrel by 0720 GMT. Prices have traded in a tight
range near $91 since hitting a 26-month high of $91.88 on
Monday.	
 ICE Brent crude  rose 18 cents to $94.32.	
 ""The oil market continues to alternate small gains with
small declines, as prices idle quietly on light
between-holiday volume,"" said Timothy Evans, energy analyst at
Citi Futures Perspective.	
 The oil market may get the impetus it needs to break
through its trading range with the release of the U.S. Energy
Information Administration fuel stocks report later on Thursday.	
 Analysts expected a 2.6 million-barrel drop in crude
inventories last week, which would be the fourth straight
drawdown in the world's largest oil user. 
 Gasoline stocks were forecast up 1.4 million barrels,
while distillates fell 600,000 barrels, a Reuters poll found.	
 Industry group American Petroleum Institute (API)
confounded analysts expectations on Wednesday by reporting a
3.1 million-barrel rise in crude, while gasoline supplies
dropped 3.1 million barrels in the week to Dec. 24.
Distillates rose 1.4 million barrels. 
 ""The API data is certainly known to be more volatile than
the more definitive EIA report, so we would wait to see those
numbers before making any big decisions,"" Evans said.	
 
 WEAKER DOLLAR, WARMER WEATHER	
 Oil prices were supported by a weaker dollar, which hit a
seven-week low against the yen and a 28-year trough against
the commodities-linked Australian currency after traders took
falls in U.S. bond yields as a cue to sell the greenback. 
 Oil and dollar-denominated commodities often move
inversely to the dollar. A weaker U.S. currency typically
lifts oil prices as it lowers the value of dollars paid to
producers while making it less expensive for oil consumers
using other currencies.	
 Bullish sentiment was limited by forecasts for warmer
weather this weekend in the U.S. Northeast, which would curb
fuel demand in the world's top heating oil market. The region
was slammed by one of the worst blizzards on record over the
Christmas holiday.	
 Technicals indicated oil prices may surge to $92.50 after
ending its consolidation period. [ID:nL3E6NU00B]

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Dec 30 (Reuters) - The dollar weakened broadly on
Thursday, hitting a seven-week low against the yen and a 28-year
low against the Australian currency as traders took falls in U.S.
bond yields as a cue to sell it.
 U.S. Treasury prices recovered on Wednesday, pushing yields
sharply lower, after a $29 billion auction of seven-year notes
drew surprisingly strong demand a day after a weak five-year
sale.
 ""Some market players may be building up positions for the
next year. As the Federal Reserve is expected to keep printing
dollars, the dollar looks set to cheapen next year,"" said Tsutomu
Soma, manager of foreign securities at Okasan Securities.
 As the euro, a natural alternative for the dollar, is
smarting from concerns over debt financing of the currency bloc's
peripheral countries, investors may be turning to other
currencies such as the yen, the Aussie and the Swiss franc, he
added.
 While the relationship with bond yields and the value of a
currency is not always straightforward, lower yields make a
currency less attractive for investors chasing better returns,
other things being equal.
 The dollar slipped as low as 81.28 yen, its lowest in seven
weeks and edging closer to a 15-year low of 80.21 yen hit in
November.
 As thin trading due to the New Year's holiday tends to
exaggerate currency moves, market players say there is risk of
the dollar falling near the November low or even to its postwar
low of 79.75 yen marked in 1995.
 Data on U.S. initial jobless claims later in the day and more
importantly U.S. manufacturing data due on Monday could provide
the impetus to push the dollar down, they said.
 Keiji Matsumoto, a strategist at Nikko Cordial Securities,
also said a rise in the Chinese yuan after China's rate hike last
Saturday is supporting Asian currencies, including the yen.
 The Chinese central bank set the yuan mid-point versus the
dollar on Thursday at a record high of 6.6229, slightly stronger
than Wednesday's 6.6247.
 ""There will be speculation that China may engineer a higher
yuan ahead of Chinese President Hu Jintao's state visit to the
United States next month,"" he said. Hu will visit Washington on
Jan. 19.
 TWO-YEAR YIELDS
 Some analysts noted, however, that dollar/yen is likely to
gain eventually as it is at too-low levels in light of its
historical correlation with the two-year U.S. Treasury yield.
 The correlation has broken down this month as the dollar fell
even as the two-year yield rose, but some market players say that
relationship will return next month when the market becomes more
liquid as many market players will come back from holidays.
 Osamu Takashima, chief Japan FX strategist at Citibank,
estimates that the current level of two-year U.S. yields, around
0.65 percent, points to around 88 yen for dollar/yen if the
historical correlation holds.
 The current level is about 3.7 sigma away from that level,
meaning the dollar is at a cheap level relative to yields that
should happen only once in 19 years, Takashima said.
 ""There is no reason to think that correlation has broken
down. It's quite reasonable to think that it will return,"" he
said.
 He added that Japanese life insurers may buy more foreign
bonds without currency hedging.
 Some of Japan's biggest life insurers have said they could
consider buying more foreign bonds without hedging if the dollar
is around 80 yen.
 The euro stayed near Wednesday's high, changing hands at
$1.3227, which corresponds to a 38.2 percent retracement of its
fall from $1.35 to $1.3055 earlier this month.
 The currency's stubborn refusal to break below the 200-day
moving average, now at $1.3086, has frustrated bearish investors
who think the euro-zone debt crisis could spread to Spain and
Portugal in early 2011.
 On the upside, it could target $1.3275-80, its high on
Tuesday as well as a 50 percent retracement of that fall.
 Still, traders say concerns over debt in some euro zone
countries could crop up any time after many investors and
policymakers come back from Christmas holidays.
 Already on Wednesday, Ireland's opposition Labour Party
threatened to call a vote of no confidence in the deeply
unpopular government if it has not set a date for an election by
the end of January.
 The Australian dollar hit a fresh 28-year high of $1.1098
against the U.S. dollar, though small option barriers at $1.02
prevented further gains in the Aussie.
 Rising commodity prices have boosted the Aussie and
helped investors shrug off fears that a recent Chinese interest
rate hike would slow China's economy and thus dampen demand for
Australian exports. London Metal Exchange copper
hit a record high.
 The Swiss franc, which has attracted funds escaping euro zone
debt, hit a new high record against the dollar, of 0.9418 franc
per dollar.

peak at $9,540.75 a tonne , while U.S. crude oil 
held within a whisker of a 2-year high near $92 a barrel,
reflecting growing optimism for global growth.	
 For now, investors seemed to be cheering prospects for a
stronger U.S. recovery in 2011 and ongoing strength in Asia,
while shrugging off the risk of more interest rate hikes in
emerging economies like China as they deal with inflation and
any flare up of the euro zone sovereign debt crisis.	
 A private survey on Thursday showed China's vast
manufacturing sector continued to expand strongly towards the
year-end, albeit at a slightly slower pace than in November.
[ID:nBJA002395]	
 Overall, analysts believe 2011 will be another positive
year for equities, particularly as ultra-low interest rates in
major economies mean there will be plenty of cash looking for
better returns.	
 ""While GFC (global financial crisis) aftershocks will
continue to cause volatility and shares are becoming
vulnerable to a short term correction in January after several
months of very strong gains, shares are likely to put in good
gains through 2011 as a whole,"" said Shane Oliver, head of
investment strategist at AMP Capital Markets.	
 MSCI's index of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan
rose 0.6 percent, and was up almost 15 percent
this year.	
 This compared with a rise of 10 percent for the MSCI World
stock index , 13.5 percent for the MSCI America
index and a paltry 1.3 percent for European
stocks .	
 South Korea's KOSPI rose 0.4 percent, closing the
year some 22 percent higher, while Indonesia's IDX Composite
index , the region's star performer, advanced 0.4
percent on Thursday, chalking up a whopping 47 percent for
this year.	
 In contrast, Japan's Nikkei fell 1.1 percent as
investors sold some of the major exporters like Toyota Motor
on a firmer yen. The index ended the year down about
3 percent, making it one of the worst performers in the region.	
 ""The recent advance of the yen has been a bit unexpected
and
clearly having a negative psychological impact on share
prices,""
said Takashi Ohba, a senior strategist at Okasan Securities.	
 Market participants, however, believe Japanese stocks are
undervalued compared with other developed markets, suggesting
scope for the laggard to make up some lost ground in 2011.	
 Many Asian markets including Japan, South Korea, Thailand,
Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia will be shut on
Friday, while others like Australia will have half-day sessions.	
 
 DOLLAR WILTS	
 The yen rose to highs not seen since Nov. 9 as the dollar
fell across the board after traders took a steep decline in
U.S. Treasury yields overnight as a signal to sell the
greenback.	
 Analysts warned thin year-end conditions made for
exaggerated moves, although some believed there could be more
dollar weakness ahead.	
 ""Some market players may be building up positions for the
next year. As the Federal Reserve is expected to keep printing
dollars, the dollar looks set to cheapen next year,"" said
Tsutomu Soma, manager of foreign securities at Okasan
Securities. 
 The dollar hit a seven-week low around 81.30 yen ,
and plumbed a 28-year low versus the Australian dollar, which
rose to a high just shy of $1.02 . The euro climbed to
$1.3259 , extending Wednesday's rebound from a low
around $1.3081.	
 China's yuan hit a record high against the dollar after
the People's Bank of China set a higher mid-point, sparking
expectation of more yuan appreciation in the first quarter of
2011.	
 The U.S. 10-year yield last traded at 3.339
percent, reversing a spike to around 3.5 percent earlier in
the week after an auction of seven-year notes on Wednesday
drew decent demand.

By Kim Yeonhee and Cheon Jong-woo 
 SEOUL, Dec 30 (Reuters) - South Korea's factory output and
service-sector activity expanded in November in a sign of the
economy's resilience in the face of cooling global demand,
cementing expectations interest rates will rise early next year.	
 Analysts said the figures indicated the economy was being
powered by recovering demand at home and in emerging markets,
which helped make up for sluggish growth in major developed
economies .
Industrial production rebounded in November after
three months of declines, rising 1.4 percent from October,
slightly more than forecast, statistics office data showed on
Thursday. 
 Service-sector output rose 0.8 percent and retail sales
grew 2.9 percent, all on a seasonally adjusted basis from the
previous month.[ID:nTOE6BS02M] [ID:nTOE6BS07H]	
 Seoul stocks and the won both rose
slightly on the last trading day of the year as investors took
the set of data released during the day as pointing to a
sustained recovery in the economy. Bond prices showed a muted
reaction.
""Today's data set contained many details
pointing to the slowdown in economic growth nearing an end, ""
said Peter Jongyoun Park, a fixed-income analyst at Woori
Investment & Securities ""I expect the economy to show signs of
hitting the bottom in the first quarter to turn around for
faster growth afterwards.""	
 The central bank forecast recently that growth in Asia's
fourth-largest economy would slow to 0.4 percent in the final
quarter of this year from 0.7 percent in the third quarter.
But it saw the economy regaining momentum soon and expanding
by more than 1 percent in the first quarter of 2011.	
 South Korea was among the top performing economies in
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
group last year and is tipped to be one of the top three this
year.
Solid economic growth and signs of rising inflation
pressure have prompted the central bank to raise interest
rates twice this year and analysts expect more to come from as
early as February next year.
The Bank of Korea last raised the benchmark interest
rate in November by 25 basis points to 2.50 percent and next
reviews the rate on Jan. 13.
Separately, the central bank said the current
account surplus in November more than halved to $1.93 billion
from a $4.89 billion surplus in October. It was the ninth
month in a row that the country posted a current account
surplus.
A central bank official told reporters later exports
so far this month were ""very strong"" and should lift the
surplus in December sharply higher from November even if
firmer global raw materials prices inflated import costs.

 * Traders look to U.S. yields for direction in thin market
 * Euro zone debt woes could come back to haunt euro
 TOKYO, Dec 30 (Reuters) - The dollar weakened on Thursday,
hitting a seven-week low against the yen and a 28-year low
against the Australian currency after traders took falls in U.S.
bond yields as a cue to sell it.
 U.S. Treasuries recovered on Wednesday, pushing yields
sharply lower, after a $29 billion auction of seven-year notes
drew surprisingly strong demand a day after a weak five-year
sale.
 The dollar slipped to 81.40 yen, its lowest in seven weeks
and edging closer to a 15-year low of 80.21 yen hit in November.
 As thin trading due to the New Year's holiday tends to
exaggerate currency moves, market players say there is risk of
the dollar falling near the November low or even to its postwar
low of 79.75 yen marked in 1995.
 Data on U.S. initial jobless claims later in the day and more
importantly U.S. manufacturing data due on Monday could provide
the impetus to push the dollar down, they said.
 Keiji Matsumoto, a strategist at Nikko Cordial Securities,
also said a rise in the Chinese yuan after China's rate hike last
Saturday is supporting Asian currencies, including the yen.
 The yuan has risen near a record high as Chinese central bank
has fixed its mid-point near the high for the past two days.
 ""There will be speculation that China may engineer a higher
yuan ahead of Chinese President Hu Jintao's state visit to the
United States next month,"" he said. Hu will visit Washington on
Jan. 19.
 The euro stayed near Wednesday's high, changing hands at
$1.3227, which corresponds to a 38.2 percent retracement of its
fall from $1.35 to $1.3055 earlier this month.
 The currency's stubborn refusal to break below the 200-day
moving average, now at $1.3086, has frustrated bearish investors
who think the euro-zone debt crisis could spread to Spain and
Portugal in early 2011.
 On the upside, it could target $1.3275-80, its high on
Tuesday as well as a 50 percent retracement of that fall.
 Still, traders say concerns over debt in some euro zone
countries could crop up any time after many investors and
policymakers come back from Christmas holidays.
 Already on Wednesday, Ireland's opposition Labour Party
threatened to call a vote of no confidence in the deeply
unpopular government if it has not set a date for an election by
the end of January.
 The Australian dollar hit a fresh 28-year high of $1.1095
against a broadly weakening dollar.
 Rising commodity prices have boosted the Aussie and
helped investors shrug off fears that a recent Chinese interest
rate hike would slow China's economy and thus dampen demand for
Australian exports. London Metal Exchange copper
hit a record high.

subject of a takeover battle between global No. 1 steelmaker
ArcelorMittal  and Nunavut Iron Ore, a private-equity
backed company formed solely for the purposes of pursuing the
bid.
 At stake is the massive Mary River iron ore deposit in the
northern Canadian territory of Nunavut. Mary River is said to
contain enough raw material to supply the needs of all of
Europe, an ocean-ride away.
 However, its geographical position on Baffin Island, above
the Arctic Circle, presents a challenge to development and
contributes to a C$4 billion ($4 billion) price to bring a mine
into production a few years from now.
 Following are some facts about the Mary River project:
 * The site was discovered in 1962 by Murray Watts of
British Ungava Explorations Ltd (Brunex), and Baffinland Iron's
predecessor company was established in 1963 by the backers and
prospectors of Brunex.
 * Baffinland started exploration at Mary River in 2004.
 * Mary River is located at the northern end of Baffin
Island about 160 km (100 miles) south of the hamlet of Pond
Inlet, Nunavut.
 * The project is expected to produce about 18 million
tonnes of iron ore per year when it is first built, and
analysts say output could almost double relatively quickly.
 * Nine deposits at Mary River so far identified are thought
to contain some 450 million tonnes of iron ore, of which 75
percent could be high grade.
 * Once built, Baffinland expects Mary River to operate
year-round for at least 21 years.
 * A 143 km (90 mile) rail and road link is planned to
connect the proposed mines to a port at Steensby Inlet, south
of Mary River, where chartered ice-breaking ore carriers would
transport the ore to markets year-round.
(http://www.baffinland.com/MaryRiverProject/default.aspx)
 * The Steensby port is 3,100 nautical miles (5,741 km) from
the key destination of Rotterdam in Europe, compared with 5,000
nautical miles from Brazil to Rotterdam.
 * The area, within the Arctic Circle, experiences 24-hour a
day darkness from November to January and 24-hour a day
sunlight between May and August.
 * The region has less than 200 mm annual precipitation and
an annual average temperature of about -15 Celsius (5
Fahrenheit).
 * Baffinland owns leases that cover about 1,593 hectares
(3,937 acres) and are renewable beyond the current 21-year
period expiring Aug. 27, 2013.

 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, Dec 29 (Reuters) - World stocks climbed to their
highest levels in more than 27 months on Wednesday and the S&P
500 headed for its best December in nearly two decades as
investors seized on indications of stronger economic growth in
2011.
 U.S. Treasuries rose after strong demand for an auction of
$29 billion in new U.S. debt provided relief a day after dismal
support for another government note sale. The decline in
Treasuries yields drove the dollar down against a basket of
major currencies <.DXY>, as lower bond yields erode the return
on U.S. assets.
 Investors have been turning to riskier assets as 2010 draws
to a close. Views that the world economy is on the mend are
driving expectations that the higher interest rates that
typically follow stronger growth will hurt returns on
government bonds and the other safe-haven assets that drew
favor after the financial crisis erupted.
 Asset allocations are seen by many analysts, including some
bond pickers, as favoring stocks in the new year.
 ""The first few days of the new year will be good as a lot
of new money will flow into the market,"" said Philippe Gijsels,
head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in
Brussels. ""But people will become cautious again.""
 Much of stocks' gains came after Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke made it clear in August that the U.S. central bank
was willing to buy more assets in order to pump liquidity into
the slowing U.S. economy.
 The Fed's quantitative easing and tax stimulus measures
have bolstered economic forecasts for 2011.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> jumped
1.9 percent, hitting the highest level since Sept. 3, 2008. The
index's emerging market counterpart <.MSCIEF> rose more than 1
percent.
 In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose
9.84 points, or 0.09 percent, to 11,585.38. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> added 1.27 points, or 0.10 percent, to
1,259.78 and the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> edged up 4.05
points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,666.93.
 The S&P 500 has risen almost 7 percent this month, pushing
the benchmark index above levels reached on Sept. 12, 2008, the
last trading day before Lehman Brothers collapsed, as improving
economic data and a changed political landscape have encouraged
risk-taking.
 Shares of a number of leading consumer-oriented companies
posted solid gains on Wednesday, with McDonald's Corp 
up 1.1 percent to $77.27 and Walt Disney Co  rising 0.9
percent to $37.69. Both companies are Dow components.
 ""People are hoping that the consumer is back and that will
help fuel the engine and grow some earnings so that companies
will start hiring,"" said Frank Ingarra, a portfolio manager at
Hennessy Funds in Stamford, Connecticut.
 Some analysts, however, remained cautious about the outlook
for stocks, wary that thin volumes over the holiday period may
not be indicative of a trend.
 ""I don't want to dismiss the recent gains, but I'm not
ready to draw a trend line,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment
officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago. ""I'd like to see how
the market responds when we have more participants and tangible
news to sink our teeth into.""
 The Nasdaq, copper and gold have been the big winners this
year. For a Reuters graphic, see http://r.reuters.com/veq33r
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> rose about a
quarter of a percent, extending a year-end rally and putting
equities on track to post their biggest monthly gain in 17
months.
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> gained 0.5 percent.
 TREASURIES IN FOCUS
 U.S. Treasury notes prices rose on Wednesday. The gains
came after a drubbing on Tuesday, following a weak $35 billion
five-year note auction, boosted value to a point where
investors could feel more comfortable with the drumbeat of debt
sales the government must conduct to fund its deficit.
 U.S. bond yields have soared a full percentage point since
October on expectations that growth will accelerate in 2011,
while concerns over the U.S. deficit have raised inflation
fears and sapped demand for the debt. Some investors, including
Jeffrey Gundlach, the chief executive of DoubleLine Capital,
have marked the sell-off as a bond buying opportunity because
much higher yields would work against economic growth.
 On Wednesday, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield declined 0.14
percentage point to 3.35 percent.
 In currency trading, the dollar hit a seven-week low and
dropped versus the euro, after Treasury yields tumbled
following the U.S. debt auction.
 ""The reaction in the bond markets is fairly sharp,"" said
Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New
York. ""There's a broader move towards a weaker U.S. currency.""
 Commodity gains boosted the Australian and New Zealand
dollars, while the euro edged up against the U.S. dollar after
holding above its 200-day moving average.
 Most analysts are bracing for more euro weakness in early
2011, but the currency's stubborn refusal to break below the
200-day moving average, now at $1.3084, has frustrated bearish
investors.
 The dollar fell against major currencies, with the U.S.
Dollar Index <.DXY> off 0.7 percent at 79.799. Against the yen,
the dollar dropped 1 percent to 81.64 yen  . The euro
 rose 0.75 percent to $1.3216.
 In commodities, U.S. light sweet crude oil <2CLc1> settled
down 37 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $91.12 a barrel. Gold 
rose $4.61, or 0.33 percent, to $1410.60.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a seven-week
low against the yen and dropped versus the euro on Wednesday,
as U.S. government bond yields tumbled following a solid debt
auction, diminishing the appeal of the greenback.
 Rising global stock prices on expectations of stronger
economic growth in 2011 also lifted investors' appetite for
higher-yielding currencies and pressured the safe-haven U.S.
dollar, analysts said.
 U.S. Treasuries extended price gains, pushing yields
sharply lower, after a $29 billion auction of seven-year notes
drew surprisingly strong demand a day after a weak five-year
sale. Lower bond yields make the dollar less attractive as it
erodes the return on U.S. assets.
 ""The reaction in the bond markets is fairly sharp,"" said
Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New
York. ""There's a broader move towards a weaker U.S. currency.""
 Thin trading ahead of the New Year's holiday likely
exaggerated currency moves, traders said.
 The dollar fell as low as 81.61 yen on trading platform
EBS, the lowest since Nov. 10. It was last down 1 percent at
81.64 yen. Support is seen around 81.50 yen.
 Citigroup technical analysts said the downward momentum in
dollar/yen may continue after the recent double top close to
84.50 and the recent dead cross constructed by the five- and
21-day moving averages.
 ""Based on the double top, the downside limit may be 80.21,
the lowest level of the year,"" they said. ""However, we do not
expect this price action to be long lived.""
 The Australian dollar rose as high as $1.0184, a 28-year
peak. Rising commodity prices boosted the Aussie and helped
investors shrug off fear that a recent Chinese interest rate
hike would slow the economy. London Metal Exchange copper hit a
record high.
 ""There's an underlying theme of more optimistic markets or
stronger risk appetite this week,"" Wells Fargo's Serebriakov
said.
 ""With optimism about the U.S. economy and global economy
starting to pick up again and with the Federal Reserve
continuing to pump liquidity into the financial system, this
should help risk appetite and risk-sensitive currencies and
probably weigh on the dollar broadly,"" he said.
 EURO WORRIES REMAIN
 The euro hit a session peak at $1.3240 on EBS before
pulling back to last trade at $1.3219, up 0.8 percent.
 Worries that the euro-zone debt crisis could spread to
Spain and Portugal have many analysts bracing for more euro
weakness in early 2011, but the currency's stubborn refusal to
break below the 200-day moving average, now at $1.3086, has
frustrated bearish investors.
 While the euro may see a rebound toward $1.35 in the near
term, any sustainable gains look unlikely, analysts said.
 ""The big issue in this case still remains whether or not
the EU will come through with some sort of tangible rescue fund
or if it will continue to bail out troubled nations on a
case-by-case basis,"" said Brendan McGrath, manager of business
solutions at Western Union Business Solutions, in Victoria,
British Columbia. ""The market is clearly looking for something
proactive from the EU before they get long euros again.""
 Analysts said year-end positioning was driving prices as
well. That's been the case with the yen and Swiss franc, both
of which have risen over recent days on repatriation flows.
 The euro was last at 1.2511 Swiss francs, more than half a
cent from a record low, while the dollar fell to 0.9466 francs,
near Tuesday's 0.9435 record low.

 By Nidhi Verma and Rajesh Kumar Singh
 NEW DELHI, Dec 29 (Reuters) - An oil trading dispute between
India and Iran escalated as Tehran refused to sell oil to India
under New Delhi's prohibitive new rules, sources on both sides
said on Wednesday.
 The Indian sources said officials from the central banks of
the two countries will meet on Friday as Iran seeks to rescue
trade worth around $12 billion a year, which could be
jeopardised by rising U.S. pressure on countries trading with
Iran to abandon all dealings.
 Last week, the Reserve Bank of India said deals with Iran
must be settled outside the Asian Clearing Union (ACU) system,
used by central banks of member nations to settle bilateral
trades.
 Analysts predicted talks would be tough and that New Delhi
might have to pay a costly bill should it abandon Iranian oil
imports.
 The Islamic Republic is under global pressure over its
nuclear programme, and although United Nations sanctions do not
forbid the purchase of Iranian oil, the United States has
pressed hard for governments and companies to stop dealing with
Tehran.
 India is the biggest buyer of Iranian crude among ACU
members, with state-owned refiners and privately owned Essar Oil
taking around 400,000 barrels per day.
 Two Indian industry sources said on Wednesday that National
Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) turned down Indian oil firms' request for
payments outside the ACU. The ACU includes the central banks of
India, Bangladesh, Maldives, Myanmar, Iran, Pakistan, Bhutan,
Nepal and Sri Lanka.
 ""Indian firms had asked Iran to immediately nominate a bank
in Europe through which payment can be made. But NIOC refused,""
said one of the sources.
 When asked if NIOC was willing to accept any mechanism
outside the ACU, a NIOC source said: ""It is not acceptable to
NIOC as this exercise is in place for so many years.""
 The source added, ""How can India unilaterally decide to halt
it without any alternative mechanism?""
 Iran's central bank requested a meeting with its Indian
counterpart, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said on Wednesday.
 ""The central bank of Iran has sought a meeting with the
RBI,"" the spokesperson said. ""No date has been fixed yet.""
 An oil industry source, who will take part in the meeting,
said the discussion between Iranian and Indian central bank
officials will take place on Friday in India's financial capital
of Mumbai.
 He said India's oil ministry has suggested that RBI stick
to the old mechanism of guaranteed payments for oil for now.
 Ambika Sharma, Deputy Secretary General at the Federation of
Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said: ""The two central
banks could look at settling the trade transaction in a currency
other than the euro and the U.S. dollar""
 
 U.S. PRESSURE
 Indian analysts said the oil dispute was due to the pressure
from the United States on the international community to stop
dealing with Tehran to force the Islamic Republic to abandon its
nuclear programme.
 Tehran says it pursues only peaceful goals and is not trying
to build a nuclear bomb.
 ""It's basically straight-forward American pressure,"" said
Siddharth Varadarajan, strategic affairs editor at the Hindu
newspaper, adding that Chinese and Russia companies could
benefit if India ceased to trade with Iran.
 U.S. President Barack Obama visited India last month and
promised to help New Delhi grow its global role, including by
supporting its bid for a permanent U.N. Security Council seat.
 ""Iran is already struggling to place their crude in the
market, and any stoppage of supply to India will further
escalate the problem specially when series of sanctions are
imposed on them"", said Praveen Kumar, who heads consultancy
FACTS Global Energy's South Asia oil and gas team.
 However, India would not want to see ties fray with Tehran,
which it sees as an ally in stabilising Afghanistan after U.S.
troops leave in 2014. It is also sensitive to internal criticism
that the decision was taken due to American pressure.
 Sanctions mean Iran will find it tough to find an
alternative buyer for oil, its major source of revenue. India
faces the prospect of a rising import bill as it seeks to
replace Iranian oil, which amounts to nearly 13 percent of its
overall crude imports.
 ""Indian refiners will continue to operate their units at
high utilisation rates to meet the domestic demand, which means
they will have to source crude from alternative avenues,"" said
Kumar.
 ""This may lead India having to pay a premium for the crude
oil it procures.""

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a seven-week
low against the yen and dropped versus the euro on Wednesday,
as U.S. bond yields tumbled following a solid debt auction,
diminishing the appeal of the greenback.
 U.S. Treasuries extended price gains, with the 30-year bond
rising over a point after a $29 billion auction of seven-year
notes saw strong demand. See [ID:nN29284358]
 The dollar slid as low as 81.63 yen on trading platform
EBS, the weakest level since Nov. 10, while the euro climbed to
a high near $1.3240 after the auction results.
 Lower bond yields make the dollar less attractive to
investors as it erodes the return on U.S. assets.
 ""The reaction in the bond markets is fairly sharp,"" said
Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New
York. The dollar ""is taking cues from the bond market.""
 Thin trading ahead of the New Year's holiday likely
exaggerated currency moves traders said.
 The euro was last at $1.3224 , up 0.8 percent on the
day. The dollar was down 1 percent at 81.65 yen .
 Worries that the euro-zone debt crisis could spread to
Spain and Portugal has most analysts bracing for more euro
weakness in early 2011, but the currency's stubborn refusal to
break below the 200-day moving average, now at $1.3084, has
frustrated bearish investors.
 Analysts said year-end positioning was driving prices as
well. That's been the case with the yen and Swiss franc, both
of which have risen over recent days on repatriation flows.
 ""The Swiss franc is well supported by fundamentals, risk
aversion and by people diversifying out of euros,"" said Niels
Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 The euro was last at 1.2527 francs , more than
half a cent from a record low, while the dollar fell 0.2
percent to 0.9473 francs , near Tuesday's 0.9435
record low.
 The Australian dollar  rose 0.7 percent to $1.0184,
a fresh a 28-year peak. Rising commodity prices -- London Metal
Exchange copper hit a record high [MET/L] -- boosted the Aussie
and helped investors shrug off fear a recent Chinese interest
rate hike would slow the economy.

 By Jack Kimball and Samantha Pearson
 BOGOTA/SAO PAULO, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Colombia's peso surged
in volatile trading on Wednesday, bouncing back from previous
losses after a scarcity of dollars on the local market
exaggerated end-of-year moves.
 The rest of Latin America's major currencies eked out more
modest gains as investors looked to take on riskier positions
heading into 2011. For details, see [ID:nN29277900].
 Colombia's peso  jumped 5.2 percent to 1937 to the
dollar, erasing this week's sharp losses, which had taken it to
its weakest level in about 8 months.
 The country's central bank has been steadily buying dollars
on the local market in an effort to curb the peso's recent
appreciation and protect exporters. But the scarcity of dollars
has prompted volatile trading this week as investors try to
settle their books in a thinly traded market.
 ""We've been seeing the same factor in the last few days and
that is the cash position. Here in Colombia we're not allowed
to have a negative position at the end of the day and people
were short on dollars,"" said Camilo Perez, head of economic
research at Banco de Bogota.
 Perez said the entry of some offshore players and some
firms selling dollars -- although the quantities were not
substantial -- helped reverse the weakening of the peso earlier
this week.
 Colombia's strong economic fundamentals should continue to
push the peso to even stronger levels, said Benito Berber, an
analyst at Nomura Securities in New York.
 This week's sharp losses were a result of a temporary
squeeze in the local market, he said, adding that it was a
perfect moment to buy the Colombian peso against the U.S.
dollar.
 ""In a couple of weeks when people return from holidays,
people will take advantage of (the peso at cheap levels) and
the situation will normalize. It's already started to happen
today,"" he said.
 The Brazilian real  closed 0.71 percent stronger at
1.678 reais per U.S. dollar on the local spot market but
volumes were extremely low.
 The Mexican currency  strengthened 0.25 percent to
12.3644 per dollar. The Chilean peso  firmed 0.19 percent
to 468.80 per dollar as the price of copper, the country's main
export, hit another record high.[ID:nLDE6BS0KV]

 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, Dec 29 (Reuters) - World stocks climbed to their
highest levels in more than 27 months on Wednesday as investors
seized on indications of stronger growth in 2011.
 U.S. Treasuries steadied after dismal demand at an auction
of five-year debt on Tuesday sent yields higher, boosting their
relative value for some investors. The dollar fell against a
basket of major currencies <.DXY>.
 Investors are turning to riskier assets as 2010 draws to a
close, persuaded that the world economy is on the mend. They
also expect that the higher interest rates that typically
follow stronger growth will hurt returns on government bonds
and other safe-haven assets, relied on since the financial
crisis erupted.
 Asset allocations are seen by many analysts, including some
bond pickers, as favoring stocks in the new year.
 ""The first few days of the new year will be good as a lot
of new money will flow into the market,"" said Philippe Gijsels,
head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in
Brussels. ""But people will become cautious again,"" he added.
 Much of stocks' gain came after Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke made it clear in August that the Fed was willing
to buy more assets in order to pump liquidity into the slowing
U.S. economy.
 This so-called quantitative easing and tax stimulus
measures have bolstered economic forecasts.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose
1.7 percent to 330.32 for a new 2010 peak and the highest since
Sept. 3, 2008. The index's emerging market counterpart
<.MSCIEF> rose more than 1 percent.
 In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained
30.31 points, or 0.26 percent, to 11,605.85. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> added 2.83 points, or 0.22 percent, at
1,261.34 and the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> rose 5.97
points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,668.85.
 The S&P 500 has risen almost 7 percent this month, pushing
the benchmark index above levels reached on Sept. 12, 2008, the
last trading day before Lehman Brothers collapsed, as improving
economic data and a changed political landscape have encouraged
risk-taking.
 ""People are hoping that the consumer is back and that will
help fuel the engine and grow some earnings so that companies
will start hiring,"" said Frank Ingarra, a portfolio manager at
Hennessy Funds in Stamford, Connecticut.
 The Nasdaq, copper and gold have been the big winners this
year. For a Reuters graphic, see http://r.reuters.com/veq33r
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> rose about a
quarter of a percent. Japan's Nikkei <.N225> gained 0.5
percent.
 TREASURIES IN FOCUS
 U.S. Treasury note prices bounced on Wednesday after thin
demand for a $35 billion five-year note auction led traders to
drub the sector on Tuesday. Despite bargain-hunting, anxiety
lingered over the drumbeat of debt sales the government will
make to fund its deficit, including Wednesday's $29 billion in
seven-year note sale.
 The Treasury will hold the auction, the last of 2010, at 1
p.m. EST (1800 GMT).
 U.S. bond yields have soared a full percentage point since
October on expectations that growth will accelerate in 2011,
while concerns over the U.S. deficit have raised inflation
fears and sapped demand for the debt.
 The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield declined 0.06 percentage
point to 3.43 percent. The Treasury selloff on Tuesday dented
demand for euro zone government debt.
 In currency trading, the dollar fell against the yen as the
return to Japan of company earnings at year-end outweighed
higher U.S. bond yields.
 Commodity gains boosted the Australian and New Zealand
dollars, while the euro edged up against the U.S. dollar after
holding above its 200-day moving average.
 Most analysts are bracing for more euro weakness in early
2011, but the currency's stubborn refusal to break below the
200-day moving average, now at $1.3084, has frustrated bearish
investors.
 The dollar fell against major currencies, with the U.S.
Dollar Index <.DXY> off 0.46 percent at 79.993. The euro 
rose 0.5 percent to $1.3182, while the dollar-yen exchange rate
 dropped 0.7 percent to 81.88 yen.
 In commodities, U.S. light sweet crude oil  fell 34
cents, or 0.37 percent, to $91.15 per barrel, and gold 
rose $5.86, or 0.42 percent, to $1411.80.

 * May fill shipments with products from other origins
 * Shares slip 1 percent in Toronto
(Adds details from conference call, market activity)
 WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Dec 29 (Reuters) - A fire at an
Alliance Grain Traders  facility in Turkey has damaged
7,000 to 10,000 tonnes of pulse and grain crops, but will not
have a significant impact on earnings, the Canadian legume
processor said on Wednesday.
 Shares of the Regina, Saskatchewan-based company slipped 1
percent in Toronto to C$27.77.
 Alliance Chief Executive Murad Al-Katib said the company
has temporarily closed pulse and grain processing facilities at
its Arbel Group site in Mersin, Turkey, until Jan. 3 after the
fire on Monday extensively damaged two warehouses and a loading
and receiving area.
 It expects to resume normal production by the third week of
January. Meantime, it will service its shipments with products
from other origins if needed.
 ""Warehouses and inventory are very easy to replace,""
Al-Katib said in a conference call with analysts. ""This
(damage) is certainly not of the magnitude it could have
been.""
 Production facilities were not damaged, but site cleanup
and rebuilding warehouses will cause delays, Al-Katib said.
 The cost of replacing warehouses and inventory is about
C$10 million to C$12 million ($10 million to $12 million), with
insurance covering the losses, Al-Katib said. He said he
doesn't expect the fire to have a material effect on
operational results.
 Alliance, which began nearly 10 years ago in Canada as
Saskcan Pulse Trading, has moved aggressively to expand its
global reach, acquiring the Turkish facility last year and
buying London trading house A. Poortman Ltd and a south
Australian pulse processor this year.
 The Arbel facility produces commercially packaged pulse,
rice and bean products for both the Turkish market and export.
It also produces pasta from durum wheat and exports it under
the Arbella Pasta brand.
 The fire has not affected pasta production.
 Based on initial reports, the fire started when a truck and
trailer carrying white beans and operated by a third party
caught fire, the company said.
 The fire's cause is under investigation, and Alliance said
it looks to be accidental. No one was hurt and there is no
material impact to the environment, Alliance said.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against the
yen on Wednesday as Japanese exporters brought earnings back
home, outweighing higher U.S. bond yields, which rose following
the prior session's weak Treasury auction.
 Commodity gains boosted the Australian and New Zealand
dollars, while the euro rose against the U.S. dollar after
holding above its 200-day moving average.
 Worries that the euro-zone debt crisis could spread to
Spain and Portugal has most analysts bracing for more euro
weakness in early 2011, but the currency's stubborn refusal to
break below the 200-day moving average, now at $1.3084, has
frustrated bearish investors.
 The euro was last at $1.3170 , up 0.4 percent, while
the dollar was down 0.6 percent at 81.98 yen , near
Tuesday's 6-1/2-week low just above 81.80 yen.
 Even with London's traders returning from a two-day bank
holiday, volume was low, leaving the market susceptible to more
exaggerated price fluctuations.
 Analysts said year-end positioning was driving prices as
well. That's been the case with the yen and Swiss franc, both
of which have risen over recent days on repatriation flows.
 But both currencies were attractive for other reasons as
well, traders said.
 ""The Swiss franc is well supported by fundamentals, risk
aversion and by people diversifying out of euros,"" said Niels
Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 The euro was at 1.2490 francs , about half a
cent from a record low, while the dollar fell 0.2 percent to
0.9506 francs , near Tuesday's 0.9435 record low.
 THE DOLLAR AND BOND YIELDS
 Yen gains were tied partly to Japanese exporters
repatriating earnings before the year ends, a common practice
that tends to support the yen.
 Over the past week, that has caused a splinter in the tight
relationship between the dollar-yen rate and U.S. bond yields
-- the dollar usually gains as bond yields rise.
 But some analysts said there may be more to it, saying
concern about U.S. finances could hurt the dollar in 2011.
 A spike higher following a weak five-year note auction on
Tuesday did help the dollar rebound from a 6-1/2-week low
against the Japanese currency.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note gained 16 basis points
on Tuesday to yield just shy of 3.50 percent, and had eased
only slightly to 3.48 percent early on Wednesday. [US/]
 But BNY Mellon analyst Neil Mellor said the relationship
between the exchange rate and yields may weaken in 2011. Should
euro-zone concerns ease and bond investor fears grow about the
impact of a recent tax plan on the U.S. fiscal deficit, ""it
cannot be assumed that a further backing up in bond yields will
continue to be supportive of the dollar vis-a-vis the yen.""
 On nine of the past 10 days the correlation between U.S.
yields and the dollar/yen rate has splintered. Mellor said.
 ""Whilst drawing inferences from the price action at this
time of year is generally best avoided, the recent price action
may well be a taste of things to come in 2011,"" he said.
 The U.S. Treasury will sell $29 billion in seven-year notes
on Wednesday.
 The Australian dollar  rose 0.4 percent to $1.0132,
near a 28-year peak hit in November. Rising commodity prices --
London Metal Exchange copper hit a record high [MET/L] --
boosted the Aussie and helped investors shrug off fear a recent
Chinese interest rate hike would slow the economy.

(Adds with ArcelorMittal extending bid deadline)	
 By John McCrank and Pav Jordan	
 TORONTO, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Nunavut Iron Ore sweetened its
hostile bid for control of Baffinland Iron Mines on
Wednesday, extending a battle with steel giant ArcelorMittal
for a vast iron ore deposit in the Canadian Arctic.	
 Nunavut Iron upped its offer to C$1.40 a share for 60
percent of Baffinland's shares, valuing the entire junior
miner at about C$550 million ($550 million) and challenging
ArcelorMittal's friendly bid of C$1.25 a share for all of the
shares.	
 An hour before its bid was due to expire at 11:59 on
Wednesday, ArcelorMittal announced it was extending the offer
until Jan. 10, but held the value of the bid at C$1.25 a share.	
 ""ArcelorMittal is considering Nunavut Iron Ore Acquisition
Inc's announcement earlier today that it has amended its
partial offer for common shares,"" Arcelor said in a statement
late in the evening.	
 The new bid from Nunavut, backed by U.S. private equity
firm Energy & Minerals Group, improved on an earlier offer of
C$1.35 a share for 50.1 percent of Baffinland's shares. It
already holds about 10 percent. [ID:nN19149286]	
 Toronto-based Baffinland said its board of directors was
reviewing the amended offer.	
 At stake is Baffinland's huge iron ore deposit on Baffin
Island in the northern Canadian territory of Nunavut. While
developing the Mary River mine will be a major logistical and
environmental challenge, the deposit is believed to be large
enough to meet all of Europe's needs for years.	
 For ArcelorMittal, which aims to be about 80 percent
self-sufficient in iron ore supply and is already the world's
largest steel maker, a successful bid would mean more direct
access to the iron ore it needs for production -- a key issue
given tight global supplies and healthy demand from Chinese
steel mills.	
 That demand has strengthened the hand of major producers
such as BHP Billiton , Rio Tinto and Vale
in negotiations with steelmakers.	
 Shares of Baffinland closed unchanged at C$1.34 after
see-sawing through the day, and were the second most actively
traded issue on the Toronto Stock Exchange with more than 8.5
million shares changing hands.	
 Prior to Nunavut's original offer of 80 Canadian cents a
share in September, Baffinland shares were at 56 Canadian cents.	
 At that time, Baffinland was looking for partners for its
flagship Mary River project, and was discussing a possible
joint venture with ArcelorMittal.	
 
 BID SEEN MOVING AHEAD	
 A Baffinland shareholder, who asked not to be named
because he was not cleared by his company to comment on the
matter, said the Nunavut bid seemed to be moving toward success.	
 ""The Nunavut plan entails building a very limited mine and
getting cash flow going relatively quickly, and building this
in phases, and I think the market has embraced this,"" the
shareholder said.	
 ""I must admit I'm a little bit skeptical, but there are
people out there who have drunk this Kool-Aid and they're
going to find out if its good or bad Kool-Aid soon enough.""	
 Nunavut Chairman Bruce Walter, a former head of Canadian
miner Sherritt International Corp , told Reuters he
believes his company's offer is ""demonstrably better"" than
ArcelorMittal's. [ID:nN29286935]	
 ""We're giving shareholders an opportunity to cash in a
significant portion of their stake if they choose to at C$1.40
and they will have an ongoing interest in a project that
clearly not only we but Arcelor have stated pretty
emphatically, by putting our money on the table, believe is a
very valuable asset going forward,"" he said.	
 Tom Meyer, an analyst at Raymond James in Toronto, said
his firm was still recommending that shareholders tender to
ArcelorMittal's all-cash offer for 100 percent control of
Baffinland, which he said was ""superior"" to Nunavut's offer
for a maximum of 60 percent control.	
 ""Continued ownership of BIM shares under (Nunavut), in our
opinion, will be subject to further share dilution, technical
risk, project delays, capital cost inflation, etc,"" he said.	
 ArcelorMittal said recently it has lockup agreements with
key shareholders and Baffinland directors holding about 25
percent of the stock. ArcelorMittal's offer values the company
at around C$490 million.	
 Nunavut Iron -- which was formed solely to buy Baffinland
-- said its new bid is for 195,312,171 common shares, worth
about C$273 million, plus the roughly 10 percent of Baffinland
stock it already owns.	
 While Nunavut's bid is for only 60 percent of Baffinland,
the company plans to offer a warrant component that would
allow shareholders who cannot immediately tender their shares
to take advantage of future value of the company once the
giant deposit is developed at an estimated cost of about C$4
billion. That component of the offer is subject to approvals
from regulators.	
 The deadline on Nunavut's sweetened offer is also Jan. 10.

 TREASURIES IN FOCUS
 U.S. Treasury note prices bounced slightly on Wednesday
after thin demand for a $35 billion five-year note auction led
traders to drub the sector on Tuesday. Despite stability,
anxiety grew over the drumbeat of debt sales the government
will make to fund its deficit, including Wednesday's $29
billion in seven-year note sale.
 The Treasury will hold the auction, the last of 2010, at 1
p.m. EST (1800 GMT).
 U.S. bond yields have soared a full percentage point since
October on expectations that growth will accelerate in 2011,
while concerns over the U.S. deficit have raised inflation
fears and sapped demand for the debt.
 The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield declined 0.01 percentage
point to 3.48 percent. The Treasury sell-off on Tuesday dented
demand for euro zone government debt.
 In currency trading, the dollar fell against the yen as the
return to Japan of company earnings at year-end outweighed
higher U.S. bond yields.
 Commodity gains boosted the Australian and New Zealand
dollars, while the euro edged up against the U.S. dollar after
holding above its 200-day moving average.
 Though worries that the euro-zone debt crisis could spread
to Spain and Portugal have most analysts bracing for more euro
weakness in early 2011, the currency's stubborn refusal to
break below the 200-day moving average, now at $1.3084, has
frustrated bearish investors.

 * Shipping association wants more protection
 
 BERLIN, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The German government said on
Wednesday its officials would hold talks with shipping
executives in January to discuss how to fight Somali pirates in
the Indian Ocean where German vessels have been targeted.
A spokesman for the Defence Ministry in Berlin told
a regular news conference the meeting with shipping industry
officials would take place in the second half of next month.
""There will be discussions but no concrete legislation is
planned,"" the spokesman said. He added the European Union's
Operation Atalanta launched in 2008 provides a framework for
deterring pirates and protecting shipping.
 Officials from the ministries of defence, foreign affairs,
transport, interior and justice will attend the meeting, as will
Deputy Economics Minister Hans-Joachim Otto. It is expected to
take place on Jan. 24, officials said.
The VDR German shipping association has called for more
protection of German ships after numerous attacks.
On Tuesday, the Kenya-based East African Seafarers
Assistance Programme said Somali pirates released the Marida
Marguerite, a German-operated chemical tanker, after receiving a
$5.5 million ransom.
 Pirates have threatened trade routes in the Gulf of Aden and
in the Indian Ocean. In recent weeks pirates have struck as far
south as Tanzania and Madagascar.
In November, 10 suspected Somali pirates captured by Dutch
forces in April during the hijacking of a German cargo ship went
on trial in Hamburg in Germany's first modern-day piracy trial. 
 The suspects were accused of boarding the German-flagged
Taipan at gunpoint in April with the aim of demanding a ransom.
The accused included seven adults and three youths who face
prison sentences of 10-15 years if convicted. 
 They were the first group of modern pirates to be prosecuted
in Germany and among the few to have been tried in Europe.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against the
yen on Wednesday as the return to Japan of company earnings at
the year's end outweighed higher U.S. bond yields, which rose
following the prior session's weak Treasury auction.
 Commodity gains boosted the Australian and New Zealand
dollars, while the euro edged up against the U.S. dollar after
holding above its 200-day moving average.
 Though worries that the euro-zone debt crisis could spread
to Spain and Portugal has most analysts bracing for more euro
weakness in early 2011, the currency's stubborn refusal to
break below the 200-day moving average, now at $1.3084, has
frustrated bearish investors.
 The euro was last at $1.3130, up 0.1 percent, while the
dollar was down 0.5 percent at 82.06 yen, not far from
Tuesday's 6-1/2-week low just above 81.80 yen.
 Even with London's traders returning from a two-day bank
holiday, volume was low, leaving the market susceptible to more
exaggerated price fluctuations. And analysts said year-end
positioning was driving prices as well.
 That's been the case with the yen and Swiss franc, both of
which have risen over recent days on repatriation flows.
 But both currencies were attractive for other reasons as
well, traders said.
 ""The Swiss franc is well supported by fundamentals, risk
aversion and by people diversifying out of euros,"" said Niels
Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 The euro was at 1.2490 francs, about half a cent from a
record low, while the dollar fell 0.2 percent to 0.9506 francs,
near Tuesday's 0.9435 record low.
 WATCHING DOLLAR-YEN, YIELDS
 Yen gains were tied partly to Japanese exporters
repatriating earnings before the year ends, a common practice
that tends to support the yen.
 That has caused a tight relationship between the dollar-yen
rate and U.S. bond yields -- the dollar usually gains as bond
yields rise -- to splinter over the last week.
 But some analysts said there may be more to it, saying
concern about U.S. finances could hurt the dollar in 2011.
 A spike higher following a weak five-year note auction on
Tuesday did help the dollar rebound from a 6-1/2-week low
against the Japanese currency.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note gained 16 basis points
on Tuesday to yield just shy of 3.50 percent, and had eased
only slightly to 3.48 percent early on Wednesday.
 BNY Mellon analyst Neil Mellor said the relationship
between the exchange rate and yields may weaken in 2011. Should
euro-zone concerns ease and bond investor fears grow about a
recent tax plan's impact on the U.S. fiscal deficit, ""it cannot
be assumed that a further backing up in bond yields will
continue to be supportive of the dollar vis-a-vis the yen.""
 On nine of the past 10 days the correlation between U.S.
yields and the dollar/yen rate has splintered. Mellor said.
 ""Whilst drawing inferences from the price action at this
time of year is generally best avoided, the recent price action
may well be a taste of things to come in 2011,"" he said.
 The U.S. Treasury will sell $29 billion in seven-year notes
on Wednesday.
 The Australian dollar rose 0.4 percent to $1.0132, not far
from a 28-year peak hit in November. Rising commodity prices,
with London Metal Exchange copper hitting a record high,
boosted the Aussie and helped investors shrug off fear a recent
Chinese interest rate hike would slow the economy.

 The central bank has said deals with Iran must be settled

 The sources requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of
the issue.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The dollar steadied against the
euro on Wednesday as a spike in U.S. Treasury yields helped it
recover from losses the previous day, while gains in commodity
prices buoyed the likes of the Australian and Canadian dollars.
 The market remained very thin, however, and susceptible to
exaggerated moves after a yo-yo session the previous day which
was marked by year-end flows and saw the dollar fall sharply
against a range of currencies.
 The turnaround came as U.S. Treasury yields rose across the
board, with the benchmark 10-year issue gaining 16 basis points
to just shy of 3.50 percent after a poor auction of five-year
bonds.
 The auction also served as a reminder of fiscal problems
facing the United States. Coupled with concerns about a debt
crisis in the euro zone, this buoyed the yen and kept the Swiss
franc near record highs versus the dollar and euro as investors
sought safety.
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance
against a basket of currencies, was flat on the day at 80.319,
holding above Tuesday's low of 79.596.
 Weak U.S. consumer confidence and home price data on
Tuesday, pointing to a fragile economy, weighed on the dollar
and tempered its recovery.
 ""Cheaper U.S. Treasury prices make them more attractive but
only to a point, and there could come a point when investors
don't want to buy them any more,"" said Neil Mellor, currency
strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.
 He added that the greenback was soft against the yen as
Japanese exporters have been selling on concerns about a
weakening dollar, as well as against commodity-linked
currencies, though he cautioned against reading too much into
moves in such an illiquid market.
 Investors will watch for a sale of seven-year U.S. debt on
Wednesday.
 The euro was steady on the day at $1.3118 after a whipsaw
move on Tuesday that took it to $1.3275, its strongest since
Dec. 17. It held above support at its 200-day moving average,
now at $1.3084, and last week's low just above $1.3050.
Sovereign offers were reported above $1.3150.

 SWISS FRANC, AUSSIE SHINE
 The euro traded at 1.2475 Swiss francs, barely above a
record low of 1.2440 francs set a week ago as investors sought
refuge from debt problems that have dogged the euro.
 The franc also held not far from a record high against the
dollar. The U.S. currency traded slightly weaker at $0.9500
after hitting an all-time low around $0.9437 on Tuesday.
 ""The Swiss franc is well supported by fundamentals, risk
aversion and by people diversifying out of euros,"" said Niels
Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 The yen, seen as another safe haven, was also supported by
risk aversion after hitting a six-week high against the dollar
and a near two-year high against sterling on Tuesday.
 The dollar slipped 0.3 percent to 82.18 yen, close to
Tuesday's low of 81.81, with traders citing stop loss orders
below 81.75. Technical analysts highlighted a bearish signal as
the dollar traded below the bottom of its daily Ichimoku cloud,
a closely watched Japanese technical indicator, at 82.39.
 Commodity-linked currencies were firm as commodity prices
stayed close to recent highs, shrugging off concerns that
China's economy could slow after its central bank raised
interest rates on Saturday as London Metal Exchange copper hit a
record high.
 The Australian dollar rose 0.2 percent to $1.0118, not far
off a 28-year peak of $1.0182 set in November. It rose as high
as $1.0153 on Tuesday. Traders cited talk of sovereigns
switching out of euros into other currencies, including the
Australian dollar, while real-money accounts were reportedly
adding to existing Aussie long positions.
 The dollar slipped 0.3 percent versus the Canadian dollar to
C$0.9982, not far from C$0.9931 hit in April, a break of which
could push it to a level not seen for 2-1/2 years.

 * Bank inspections latest in series of action on ""hot money""

 (Recasts with central bank comment)
 TAIPEI, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Taiwan's central bank said on
Wednesday it had found ""unusual trading strategies"" during
inspections of banks' foreign exchange operations, and will seek
an investigation, in its latest clampdown on what it sees as
destabilising ""hot money"".
 The bank had launched the inspections two days after
tightening limits on trading in non-deliverable forwards (NDFs),
the latest in a series of measures as it grapples with a Taiwan
dollar that has risen to 13-year highs.
 The central bank has waged a running battle for most of this
year against surges in the domestic currency, prompted by
concerns that a strong Taiwan dollar could destabilise the
export-dependent economy and create asset bubbles.
 In a statement late on Wednesday, it said ""a small number of
authorized foreign exchange banks have targeted specific times
of the day to sell off large quantities of foreign exchange,
inciting panic and disorder in the foreign exchange market"".
 The central bank said it had spoken to the heads of two
banks and asked regulators for an investigation into the reasons
behind the ""unusual"" trading strategy. It did not name the
banks.
 ""Our inquiry has revealed that the funding for these
transactions originates exclusively from the inward remittance
made by certain foreign investors,"" it said, adding that the
probe will seek the final beneficiaries behind those investors.
 Foreign capital inflows to Asia have risen sharply this
year, attracted by better growth prospects and potential returns
than in major developed economies, sparking defensive measures
in many economies fearful of the volatility such flows bring.
 Taiwan's central bank has long been among the most hawkish
in fighting speculation, and has a track record of making
adjustments to regulations and seeking information from banks as
a way of exerting pressure and reminding banks of its presence.
 It had earlier this year conducted inspections of five or
six banks' currency forwards businesses, but has stopped short
of measures such as taxes on speculative money.
 
 ""COFFEE AND A CHAT""
 An official of the central bank's foreign exchange division
said later on Wednesday that the two bank chiefs had been called
in ""for a cup of coffee"", and had promised to remedy the issue.
 The official, who did not want his name to be used, said he
did not see the need to talk to other banks at present.
 Citibank faced an inspection the previous day and had also
been called in for coffee.
 It said in a statement earlier on Wednesday that the central
bank had sought ""to understand the bank's foreign exchange
trading situation but had found nothing out of the ordinary.""
 A dealer at a foreign bank in Taipei said the inspections
will simply mean that banks will be even more punctilious in
their daily reports on trading to the central bank.
 The dealer added that the central bank's actions cannot
ultimately change the demand for the Taiwan dollar.
 The Taiwan dollar rose over 3 percent to as high as T$29.402
to the U.S. dollar on Wednesday, continuing its recent run of
big surges.
 But it closed only 0.1 percent higher at T$30.367, with the
central bank intervening at the end of trading as it does on a
daily basis.
 The Taiwan dollar has risen about 5 percent so far this
year, but without the intervention would be up over 8 percent.
That still leaves it behind regional peers the peso and ringgit,
but above the 1.5 percent rise in fellow electronics exporter
South Korea's currency, which is also restrained by
intervention.
 Analysts say that the main risk to Taiwanese exporters from
a stronger dollar is likely to fall on smaller firms.
 ""The Taiwan dollar, at this point, will certainly have some
impact on all tech exporters but it has been rising for a period
of time, one to two quarters, so most companies knew that trend
and must have hedging tools,"" said John Chiu, a vice president
and fund manager at Fuh Hwa Securities Investment Trust.
 ""Big companies have experience on this but small-cap
companies might face risks if they don't respond quickly.""

 * Short term foreign borrowing by banks capped at 30 pct

 * Banks must disclose prime lending rates from March
(Adds new details throughout)	
 By Aditya Suharmoko	
 JAKARTA, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Indonesia's central bank moved
on Wednesday to mop up excessive liquidity and encourage more
lending, announcing fresh measures that sought also to protect
Southeast Asia's biggest economy against new inflationary
pressures.	
 Bank Indonesia said the minimum dollar reserve requirement
for commercial banks would be raised to 5 percent of total
deposits from March 1 and to 8 percent on June 1, from the
current 1 percent.	
 A rise to 5 percent in dollar reserve requirement -- which
banks store at the central bank -- was expected to absorb
$1.5-2.5 billion from the market, while the rise to 8 percent
could absorb $3 billion, deputy bank governor Budi Mulya told
a news conference.	
 Indonesian officials have tried channeling strong capital
flows into the country towards longer-dated investments for
fear a change in risk sentiment may trigger a ""hot money""
reversal, hurting the local currency and
financial stability. [ID:nL3E6MN0OJ] 
 
 DARLING OF EMERGING MARKETS 
 Indonesia has been a darling of emerging market investors
this year. The currency has risen nearly 3.5 percent and the
stock market 40 percent -- driven by strong domestic
consumption.	
 Foreigners have so far this year bought net 86.8 trillion
rupiah ($9.6 billion) worth of Indonesian government bonds and
9.7 trillion rupiah of central bank SBI debt, latest Bank
Indonesia data shows.	
 But Indonesia joins countries from South Korea to Brazil
that have implemented stricter measures to protect their
economies from a tide of capital, although Jakarta's steps
have been more modest.	
 ""The concern could stem from the fact that most foreign
investors buying local assets exchange their dollar liquidity
for rupiah via local commercial banks, which could lead to an
alarming situation and create rupiah instability should there
be a sudden and massive unwinding,"" Enrico Tanuwidjaja, an
economist at OSK-DMG in Singapore, said of the new measures.	
 ""I think Bank Indonesia is trying to ensure that local
banks employ closer monitoring of their U.S. dollar banking
books.""	
 The central bank on Wednesday also capped banks' vostro
accounts at a maximum 30 percent of capital beginning end
January, with a three-month transition time. Vostro accounts
are rupiah deposits in commercial banks held by foreigners and
considered a form of short-term borrowing by the institution.	
 Inflation, the Achilles heel of Southeast Asia's largest
economy, may yet prevent growth from reaching 6-6.5 percent as
expected next year. Local food prices have been creeping up as
heavy rains have affected commodities, while the partial end
to a pump price subsidy on fuel and new taxes on vehicles will
also be felt.	
 
 BENCHMARK RATE STABLE 
 Governor Darmin Nasution said on Wednesday that the
central bank would keep its benchmark interest rate -- which
has been at 6.5 percent for over a year -- consistent with the
inflation target range of 4-6 percent in 2011, and 3.5-5.5
percent in 2012.	
 ""Although we think that they will eventually raise
interest rates in April 2011, there is a risk of them being
reactive, instead of pre-emptive, in doing so,"" said Helmi
Arman, an economist at Bank Danamon.	
 ""Capital inflows have been a key concern among
policy-makers. So far Bank Indonesia has taken liquidity
management measures to mop up liquidity and sterilize their
foreign exchange intervention.""	
 On Wednesday Bank Indonesia also announced that commercial
banks with assets of more than 10 trillion rupiah would be
required to disclose their prime lending rates starting March
31.	
 The regulation may bring down rates and spur more lending
to businesses which frequently complain about the high rates
demanded by commercial banks, which currently hover around
14-15 percent.	
 Deputy governor Muliaman D. Hadad said banks would have to
disclose their base lending rates for corporates, retails and
consumers, both mortgage and non-mortgage.	
 This year's lending was estimated to grow by 22 percent,
he said, and between 22-24 percent next year.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Dec 29 (Reuters) - World stocks were close to fresh
27-month highs on Wednesday as investors headed towards the new
year buoyed by hopes of a global growth spurt in 2011.
 U.S. Treasuries steadied after yields jumped overnight
following dismal demand at an auction of five-year notes. The
dollar was about a fifth of a percent lower against a basket of
major currencies.
 A weaker dollar lifted demand for commodities, and London
Metal Exchange copper rose to a record $9,437.50 a tonne before
easing back, with the metal boosted also by a stoppage at a key
port in major producer Chile.
 Moves by China to slash export quotas on the rare earths
minerals used in high tech and automotive manufacture had no
impact on listed metals prices, traders said.
 Wall Street looked set to open with gains.
 Investors are finishing up 2010 with a rally in riskier
assets, persuaded that the world economy is on the mend and that
the cost of many safe-haven assets such as benchmark government
bonds is too high for the potential returns.
 A Reuters graphic -- http://r.reuters.com/veq33r -- shows
copper, gold and the U.S. over-the-counter Nasdaq index to be
the big winners this year.
 Much of the stock market gains, however, came after Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke made clear in August that the Fed
was willing to buy more assets in order to pump liquidity into
the then-slowing U.S. economy.
 ""The one thing the market has got going for it is the U.S.
economy regaining momentum. At the moment the market doesn't
want to know the bad news -- and it's very reluctant to give up
any ground whatsoever,"" said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at
Brewin Dolphin Securities, in London.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index was up a fifth of a
percent, just shy of a new 2010 high that would take it to
levels last seen in early September 2008.
 The index's emerging market counterpart was up two thirds of
a percent. It is up more than 16.6 percent this year.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 was up 0.2 percent. Earlier,
Japan's Nikkei gained 0.5 percent.

 TREASURIES IN FOCUS
 U.S. Treasuries recovered some losses after prices fell
broadly on Tuesday in the aftermath of a poor auction of 5-year
notes.
 U.S. bond yields have soared this month on expectations that
2011 will see accelerating economic growth, while concerns over
the U.S. deficit have also weighed on the debt.
 The 10-year U.S. Treasury was yielding 3.44 percent, down 5
basis points.
There was some weakness in euro zone government debt linked
to the overnight Treasury sell-off.
 The dollar slipped against a basket of major currencies
after stabilising somewhat, with the U.S. Treasury auction and
weak U.S. consumer confidence weighing.
 The market remained very thin, however, and susceptible to
exaggerated moves.

 The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation said
last week it expected global supplies to remain tight this and
next crop season despite better-than-expected output because
demand has also risen.
 But Weisser, Bunge's chairman and chief executive, shrugged
off concern that food inflation may be here to stay, according
to the Financial Times.
 Assuming that a normal growing season in the southern
hemisphere is followed by a healthy one in the north, prices
will start normalising in 2012, Weisser told the newspaper.
 ""It doesn't worry me at all. I think there is enough land
available, there is enough water available,"" he said, adding
that with U.S. corn above $6 a bushel and soybeans just under
$14 -- their highest level in two years -- Brazilian farmers
would probably plant more, increasing supply.

 By Josie Cox
 FRANKFURT, Dec 29 (Reuters) - German builder Hochtief
prepared to lose its fight for independence from Spanish
predator ACS on Wednesday, revealing a deal with its creditors
to allow for the change of control.
 Hochtief's lenders have waived their right to cancel credit
lines should any shareholder hold more than 30 percent,
Hochtief's chief financial officer said in a newspaper
interview, smoothing the way for the much more heavily indebted
ACS to build a controlling stake.
 He said lenders were happy that the company was well
capitalised enough, thanks in part to its sale of a 9.1 percent
stake to the government of Qatar in December. That move was seen
at the time as a defence against the takeover.
 ""Considering the significant probability of (ACS being able
to surpass the 30 percent threshold), we asked our lenders under
what circumstances they would waive the change of control
clauses,"" CFO Burkhard Lohr told Germany's Boersen Zeitung
daily.
 ""In this sense, the capital increase and Qatar Holding's
share acquisition were worth gold.""
 By the end of Wednesday, ACS needs to have control of more
than 30 percent of Hochtief under a nine-for-five all-share
offer to give it the right under German takeover law to increase
its stake further by buying shares in the market.
 ACS plans to raise its stake to 50 percent. It hopes to
benefit from Hochtief's stronger balance sheet, reduce its
dependence on the bombed-out Spanish construction industry and
bulk up to win more international projects.
 Net debt at ACS stood at 9.08 billion euros ($11.94 billion)
at the end of September. Hochtief puts its own debt at just 447
million euros.
 On Wednesday, ACS said its stake was approximately 29.40
percent, or 22,637,567 voting rights. Sources familiar with the
deal said last week that ACS' calculations exclude a 2.5 percent
stake pledged by key shareholder Southeastern Asset Management
-- which is also a top investor in ACS.
 Burkhard said the agreement with creditors would protect
Hochtief's creditworthiness and also allow it to avoid paying
ACS a special dividend.
 ACS, headed by Real Madrid soccer club president Florentino
Perez, last week said that it had cleared the way to own 30
percent through the support of Southeastern.
 Hochtief's sale of a 9.1 percent stake to Qatar diluted
ACS's stake in Hochtief to around 27 percent from 29.9 percent,
but ACS responded by sweetening its bid, offering nine ACS
shares for every five Hochtief shares, up from its previous
eight-for-five offer.
 The offer, formally launched on Dec. 1 but initially
mentioned over three months ago, expires at midnight on
Wednesday.
 ACS said that it will announce the total number of shares
tendered during the period, on Jan. 4.
 Shares in Hochtief were trading 0.1 percent lower by 1001
GMT, narrowly underperforming Frankfurt's 0.3 percent higher
mid-cap index.
 Shares in ACS were trading 0.3 percent higher by 1001 GMT.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The dollar stabilised on
Wednesday as a spike in U.S. Treasury yields helped it recover
from losses the previous day, while gains in commodity prices
lifted currencies such as the Australian dollar.
 The dollar's gains were tempered, however, as weak U.S.
consumer confidence and home price data on Tuesday pointed to a
fragile economic recovery.
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance
against a basket of currencies, was slightly easier on the day
at 80.278, though it held above Tuesday's low of 79.596.
 The Swiss franc held near a record high against the euro and
the dollar as investors sought refuge from the debt problems
that have dogged the euro recently. The dollar also threatened
to break below a familiar range against the yen, another
currency that tends to gain from aversion to risk.
 The market remained very thin, however, and susceptible to
exaggerated moves after a yo-yo session the previous day which
was marked by year-end flows and saw the dollar fall sharply
against a range of currencies.
 The turnaround came as U.S. Treasury yields rose across the
board, with the benchmark 10-year issue gaining a hefty 16 basis
points to reach just shy of 3.50 percent after a poor auction of
five-year bonds.
 ""Higher U.S. yields are supporting the dollar, though the
very thin market is making big moves possible,"" said Niels
Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.3128 after a whipsaw move
on Tuesday that took it to $1.3275, its strongest since Dec. 17.
It held above support at its 200-day moving average, now at
$1.3084, and last week's low just above $1.3050.
 Higher yields make the dollar more attractive for investors
chasing better returns, though analysts cautioned that poor bond
auctions also highlight the fiscal problems facing the United
States. Investors will watch for a sale of seven-year debt on
Wednesday.
 ""If U.S. yields are rising because of worries over U.S.
fiscal conditions, or rising inflation expectations, that's
probably negative for the dollar,"" said Tohru Sasaki, chief FX
strategist at JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo.
 
 SWISS FRANC, AUSSIE SHINE
 The euro fetched 1.2495 Swiss francs, barely above a record
low of 1.2440 francs set a week ago.
 The franc also held not far from a record high against the
dollar. The U.S. currency traded at $0.9523 after hitting an
all-time low around $0.9437 on Tuesday.
 ""The Swiss franc is well supported by fundamentals, risk
aversion and by people diversifying out of euros,"" said Nordea's
Christensen.
 The yen was also supported by risk aversion after hitting a
six-week high against the dollar and a near two-year high
against sterling pound on Tuesday.
 The dollar slipped 0.3 percent to 82.17 yen, off Tuesday's
low of 81.81 yen. In what technical analysts see as a major
bearish sign, it dropped below the bottom of the daily Ichimoku
chart at 82.39.
 Commodity-linked currencies staged solid gains as commodity
prices rose, with London Metal Exchange copper hitting a record
high on Wednesday.
 The Australian dollar rose 0.3 percent to $1.0128, not far
off a 28-year peak of $1.0182 set in November. It rose as high
as $1.0153 on Tuesday, shrugging off China's decision to raise
interest rates on Saturday.
 Traders also cited talk of sovereigns switching out of euros
into other currencies, including the Australian dollar.
 The dollar slipped 0.3 percent versus the Canadian dollar to
C$0.9981, not far from C$0.9931 hit in April, a break of which
could push it to a level not seen for 2-1/2 years.

 By Lu Jianxin and Jason Subler	
 SHANGHAI, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The yuan closed up
slightly against the dollar on Wednesday and appeared to
be set for a new leg of measured appreciation after the
People's Bank of China fixed its mid-point near a record high
for the second day.	
 The PBOC set the day's mid-point against the
dollar, from which the yuan can rise or fall 0.5 percent in a
given day, at 6.6247, up slightly from Tuesday's 6.6252 and
just shy of a record high of 6.6239 on Nov. 12.	
 But the central bank appeared reluctant to let the yuan
rise too fast, amid the threat of speculative capital inflows
seeking returns on higher interest rates and expectations of
yuan appreciation, and that attitude prevented it from letting
the yuan's mid-point breach its record on Wednesday, traders
said.	
 Spot yuan finished at 6.6212 per
dollar, up from Tuesday's close of 6.6248 and now only 39
pips away from the record high of 6.6173 hit on Nov. 11.	
 Many traders expect the yuan to breach the
post-revaluation high this year, although they believe it may
not be able to effectively breach the psychologically
important level of 6.60 to the dollar, with only a couple of
trading days left.	
 They see the currency's gains quickening in January ahead
of the visit by Chinese President Hu Jintao to the United
States in mid-January. As for all of 2010, the yuan's
appreciation will still be measured and intermittent, traders
say.	
 ""The PBOC needs to balance the anti-inflation campaign
with preventing excessive capital inflows,"" said a senior
trader at a major European bank in Shanghai. ""Yuan
appreciation gains plus interest rate premiums will be strong
enough stimuli to invite speculative hot money into China,
particularly now when developed economies are not in good
shape.""	
 
 HOT MONEY	
 Offshore, one-year non-deliverable dollar/yuan forwards
were bid at 6.4730 in late trade, down
slightly from Tuesday's close of 6.4800. The implied yuan
appreciation in a year's time edged up to 2.34
percent from 2.23 percent.	
 Traders said offshore forwards had lagged in
response to the latest signs of yuan appreciation, due mainly
to thin holiday trading, but they might in coming weeks
increasingly imply greater appreciation over the next year.	
 An informal poll of China-based dealers over the last week
showed that many expect the yuan to gain roughly 6 percent
next year, hitting 6.25 per dollar in late 2011, as the
exchange rate plays an increasing role in the battle against
inflation, which rose to a 28-month high in November.
[ID:nTOE6BQ01Y]	
 China is also in an official interest rate rise cycle on
top of the fact that returns on money in the country are
already much higher than in advanced economies including the
United States.	
 In the latest such step, the PBOC raised official lending
and deposit rates by 25 basis points on Saturday.
[ID:nTOE6BO010]	
 China's fixed one-year yuan savings rate of 2.75 percent
is now nearly 200 basis points higher than the one-year U.S.
dollar LIBOR at only 0.78 percent.	
 ""People have various ways to circumvent capital controls
nowadays, as China becomes more open to the outside world,""
said a trader at a Chinese commercial bank in Shenzhen. ""Even
with the costs of evading regulatory hurdles being factored
in, currency and interest rate gains are enough to attract hot
money flows into China.""	
 China has seen a steady increase of fund inflows in the
last decade, partly from speculators betting on yuan
appreciation.	
 The latest PBOC data showed capital inflows slowed in
November from a near record high in October but remained at a
high level. [ID:nTOE6BI00V]

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The dollar stabilised on Wednesday
after a spike in U.S. Treasury yields helped it recover from a
sharp loss against the euro in a yo-yo session the previous day
marked by thin year-end flows.
 The Swiss franc held near a record high against the euro and
the dollar as investors sought refuge from euro zone debt, while
the dollar threatened to break below a familiar range against the
yen, another currency that tends to gain from risk-aversion.
 ""The market is not driven by factors, but the thin conditions
mean there could be more volatile moves,"" said a trader at a
Japanese bank.
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance
against a basket of major currencies, was slightly easier on the
day at 80.29, though it still held above Tuesday's low of 79.596.
 ""A lot of positioning has been flushed out after last night,
so I don't expect much action today. There's nothing around in
the order books at the moment,"" said a trader at a U.S.
investment bank in Sydney.
 The turnaround came as U.S. Treasury yields rose across the
board, with the benchmark 10-year issue gaining a hefty 16 basis
points to reach just shy of 3.50 percent as dealers sought a
bigger concession to take Wednesday's sales of seven-year
government debt.
 The higher yields helped make the dollar more attractive for
investors chasing better returns, though some analysts cautioned
that the rise in bond yields, triggered after a weak five-year
bond auction, may not bode well for the dollar.
 ""If U.S. yields are rising because of worries over U.S.
fiscal conditions, or rising inflation expectations, that's
probably negative for the dollar,"" said Tohru Sasaki, chief FX
strategist at JPMorgan Chase Bank.
 The euro stood at $1.3130 after a whipsaw move on Tuesday
that took it to $1.3275, its best level since Dec. 17.
 Although it slipped from that high, it held above its 200-day
moving average, now at $1.3086, which has served as a strong
support for more than a week.
 SWISS FRANC SHINES
 The euro remained near a record low against Swiss franc, a
safe-haven currency that has attracted funds escaping euro zone
debts on worries that some euro zone countries could face severe
financing problems.
 The euro fetched 1.2495 francs, barely above a record low of
1.2440 francs set a week ago.
 The franc also held not far from a record high against the
dollar. The U.S. currency traded at $0.9520 after hitting an
all-time low around $0.9437 on Tuesday.
 The yen, which tends to be favoured when investors grow
risk-averse, was also supported after having hit a 6-week high
against the dollar and a near two-year high against the British
pound on Tuesday.
 On Wednesday, the dollar slipped 0.2 percent to 82.20 yen,
off Tuesday's low of 81.81 yen. But in a major bearish sign it
dropped below the bottom of the daily ichimoku chart at 82.39.
 JPMorgan's Sasaki said moves in the dollar/yen tend to gather
momentum towards new year from Christmas.
 In the past three years, the rate has moved 3.5 percent on
average in the first three days of year, and 2.0 percent in the
last three trading days, compared to 0.7 percent in the three
days around the Christmas holidays, he said.
 If the pair falls in the coming days, and the size of the
fall matches the average of the past three years, that would see
the dollar well below its postwar low of 79.75 yen by next week.
 Meanwhile commodity currencies also maintained momentum
thanks to a rally in commodity prices.
 The Aussie stayed within sight of re-testing a 28-year peak
of $1.0182 set in November, standing at $1.0100. It rose as high
as $1.0153 on Tuesday.
 China raised interest rates on Saturday for the second time
in just over two months to fight stubbornly high inflation, and
analysts expect more to come in 2011.
 Although that helped knock down Shanghai shares to a
three-month low, commodities markets have so far taken the
Chinese rate hike in their stride.
 Oil hit a two-year high of $91.88 this week while copper has
been setting a fresh record every day.
 Some analysts warn that when markets get back to normal from
holiday mode, various correlations including that between Chinese
shares and the Australian dollar may return to normal too,
possibly weighing on the Aussie.
 Traders also caution that depending on how the Aussie
performs a double-top could be in the making.
 ""We've seen some corporate selling of the Aussie above $1.01.
It will probably be a bit heavy on any rally but I really don't
see much happening until liquidity picks up in January,"" a trader
in Sydney said.
 The Canadian dollar also stayed near its April high, a break
of which would push it to a level not seen for 2 ½ years.
 The U.S. dollar slipped 0.1 percent to C$1.0001, not far from
C$0.9931 hit in April.

 TOKYO, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The dollar found a firmer footing
on Wednesday after a sharp reversal against the euro the previous
day in whipsaw action exaggerated by thin year-end flows.
 Partly due to the erratic nature of the market, the Swiss
franc held near a record high against the euro and the dollar as
investors sought refuge from euro zone debt, while the dollar
threatened to break below a familiar range against the yen.
 ""The market is not driven by factors, but the thin conditions

 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance

 ""A lot of positioning has been flushed out after last night,

 The euro stayed flat at $1.3125 after a whipsaw move on
Tuesday that took it to $1.3275, its best level since Dec. 17.
 Although it slipped from that high, the euro held above its
200-day moving average, now at $1.3086, which has served as a

 The Aussie is up around 14 percent on the U.S. dollar so far
this year, and has surged 23 percent against the euro.
 However, some analysts doubt the Aussie can perform as well
next year.
 China raised interest rates on Saturday for the second time

analysts expect more to come in 2011.
 That helped knock down Shanghai shares to a three-month low,

 SINGAPORE, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Asian shares rose on
Wednesday, with Japan's Nikkei maintaining a fourth quarter
rally as investors hunted bargains in one of the developed
world's cheapest markets, but Australia's main index lagged as

rose to a record $9,437.50 a tonne on Wednesday, boosted also
by a stoppage at a key port in major producer Chile. 
 Copper's strength failed to support mining giants Rio
Tinto and BHP Billiton , which both fell more
than 1 percent as heavy rain disrupted mining and shipping
operations. China's Christmas Day interest rate rise also
prompted investors to fret about weaker demand for industrial
metals, but analysts said the impact was likely to be
short-lived.	
 ""The Chinese rate rise was key but it appears it is more
about curbing inflation and demand for base metals will not
fall sharply,"" said Ben Potter, research analyst at IG Markets.	
 Tokyo's Nikkei rose 0.5 percent, despite the
stronger yen that hurt some big exporters such as Canon Inc
. The Nikkei has risen nearly 10 percent in the final
quarter of 2010, although it is down 2 percent for the year.	
 With shares trading around 1.1 times book value, Japan
remains one of the cheapest developed markets after debt-hit
Ireland, Greece and Italy.	
 ""There is no solid reason to sell Japanese shares actively
as the outlook for the market is still bright,"" said
Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment
Management.	
 MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
was also up 0.5 percent and has risen more
than 13 percent this year. Australia's benchmark
underperformed the region to end flat as the big miners weighed.	
 Australia's Lynas Corp , which owns the richest
known deposit of rare earth outside China, rose 10.8 percent
after China, which produces 97 percent of the minerals, cut it
export quotas. Rival Arafura rose 11.1 percent.	
 
 DOWNBEAT DATA	
 U.S. shares eked out gains on Tuesday on strength in oil
majors such as Chevron and Exxon Mobil ,
although downbeat consumer confidence data kept gains in
check. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.2
percent and the broader S&P 500 was up 0.1 percent.	
 Foreign exchange trading was typically choppy in thin
year-end trade, when light volumes can cause exaggerated moves
from modest flows of funds. 
 A spike in U.S. Treasury yields boosted the allure of the
U.S. currency, with the dollar index , which measures
its performance against a basket of major currencies, steady
around 80.3, off an overnight low of 79.596.	
 ""The market is not driven by factors, but the thin
conditions mean there could be more volatile moves,"" said a
trader at a Japanese bank.	
 The dollar bought around 82.30 yen, and the euro stood at
$1.3130, after beating a rapid retreat from a two-week high
around $1.3274 the previous day.	
 The slide in U.S. Treasuries prompted a similar retreat
for Japanese government bonds, with March 10-year futures
<2JGBv1> down 0.17 point and the 10-year yield up 3.0 basis
points. 
 Oil eased a little on forecasts of warmer weather in the
blizzard-hit northeastern United States, the world's biggest
heating oil market. Benchmark U.S. crude futures fell 7 cents
to $91.42 a barrel. The freezing weather had helped drive oil
to a 26-month high at $91.88 on Monday. 
 ""Oil is tracking the cold weather in the northeast of the
United States and also the dollar against the euro,"" said
Tetsu Emori, a fund manager at Tokyo-based Astmax Co Ltd.	
 Spot gold traded around $1,406 per ounce, close to
a two-week high of $1,406.75, as the lacklustre U.S. data
boosted its safe-haven appeal.	
 ""The U.S. economy outlook and monetary policy is a key
factor that influences gold prices,"" said Hou Xinqiang, an
analyst at Jinrui Futures in China. ""We've seen data alternate
between good and bad, showing that the economy is recovering,
but without a strong momentum yet.""

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Global stocks edged higher on
Tuesday on expectations the U.S. economy is on track for
recovery while oil prices edged close to a 26-month high as
winter weather drove demand.
 The dollar hit a record low against the Swiss franc and
tumbled against the yen after Japan reported its factory output
rose in November for the first time in six months.
 U.S. Treasury prices fell after a weak $35 billion auction
of five-year notes and ahead of an auction of seven-year notes
on Wednesday.
 Trading volumes in all markets were light due to the
post-Christmas holiday and as the northeastern United States
dug out from a blizzard that disrupted travel.
 ""Data in recent weeks have been supportive of the stocks
and commodity markets globally,"" said David Cohen, director of
Asian Economic Forecasting at Action Economics. ""The U.S. will
avoid a double-dip. The Asian region, including Japan, looks a
little bit better, with its industrial production finally
showing an increase.""
In New York, the Dow and S&P 500 ticked higher as the cold
weather in the Northeast lifted oil prices and energy shares.
 The MSCI All Country World index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.16
percent while the Thomson Reuters global stock index
<.TRXFLDGLPU> gained 0.02 percent.
 But investors were reluctant to take large new positions
after weaker-than-expected U.S. data on consumer confidence and
home prices.
 U.S. single-family homes fell almost double the expected
pace in October, according to S&P/Case Shiller home prices
indexes, while a report from the Conference Board, an industry
group, showed an unexpected deterioration of consumer
confidence in December as worries about jobs increased. For
details, see [ID:nNLLRNE6QV] [ID:nN28126497]
 Despite the disappointing data, ""it's not impacting the
market so much due to the light volume and lack of activity,""
said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners
in New York.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 20.51
points, or 0.18 percent, at 11,575.54. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 0.98 points, or 0.08 percent, at
1,258.52. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 4.39

 Both Chevron Corp  and Exxon Mobil  touched
52-week highs, with Chevron adding 1.2 percent to $91.19 and
Exxon climbing 0.6 percent to $73.42. Both companies are Dow
components.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares closed up 0.3 percent at 1,140.44 points. Volume was
extremely low at just one-quarter of the 30-day average. Many
traders closed their books for the year, while a holiday in
Britain and the bad weather in the U.S. Northeast thinned
trading floors. The UK market will reopen on Wednesday.
 Shares in Japan and China eased on Tuesday on concerns
further Chinese monetary tightening will cool growth in China,
which has been the engine of world economic growth. Those
worries overshadowed the rise in Japanese factory output in
November, which pointed to improving demand.
 The front month futures contract for the Nikkei 225 stock
index <0#NK:> trading in Chicago fell 30 points to 10.325.
 The dollar was flat against major currencies <.DXY>, while
the euro  fell 0.34 percent at $1.3114 after climbing as
high as $1.3274 overnight.
 The dollar also hit an all-time low against the Swiss franc
 at around 0.9435 francs on year-end buying by Swiss
corporates.
 The yen rallied against the dollar after the Japanese
factory data. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was
down 0.43 percent at 82.43.
 COMMODITIES RALLY, BONDS EYED
 Crude oil prices  settled up 0.54 percent at $91.49 a
barrel, just shy of the $91.88 reached on Monday -- the highest
level since October 2008, boosted by demand for heating oil
after one of biggest snowstorms on record hit the U.S. East
Coast.
 Spot gold prices  rose $21.26, or 1.54 percent, to
$1,404.80 an ounce.
 ""Both oil and gold are seeing robust demand. The market
seems to have shrugged off the interest-rate hike in China over
the weekend,"" said Dean Popplewell, chief strategist of FX
brokerage OANDA in Toronto.
 U.S. government bonds were mixed ahead of Wednesday's $29
billion auction of seven-year notes, which will likely need to
price at a higher yields to attract interest.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 41/32, with the yield at 3.4873 percent. The two-year U.S.
Treasury note  was up 1/32, with the yield at 0.7512
percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was down
68/32, with the yield at 4.5299 percent.

 By Michael O'Boyle and Samantha Pearson
 MEXICO CITY/SAO PAULO, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Colombia's peso
sank to an eight-month low on Tuesday after heavy demand for
dollars in a thinly traded market knocked the currency more
than 2 percent weaker against the greenback.
 Analysts said a tight supply of local dollars was
overwhelmed by year-end corporate demand.
 Colombian authorities have crimped the dollar supply in
recent weeks through efforts such as central bank dollar
purchases designed to weaken the currency and help exporters
weather this year's sharp appreciation of the peso.
 The Colombian peso spot rate  surged almost 42
pesos to 2,037 per dollar on Tuesday.
 ""The action in the spot market just went through the roof,""
said Benito Berber, an analyst at Nomura Securities in New
York.
 The dollar strengthened against the Colombian peso in the
spot market more than it did in the the non-deliverable
forwards market (NDF) <0#COPF=>, which most foreigners use to
make bets on Colombia's currency.
 Berber noted that such an inversion of the NDF curve,
where spot prices normally trail forward points, made it more
expensive for market players to take positions in favor of the
peso, which could further pressure the currency against the
dollar.
 Analysts expect the currency will eventually snap back to
trade firmer, helped by expectations the country will win an
investment grade rating from Wall Street agencies next year.
 President Juan Manuel Santos is aiming to push a fiscal
reform bill through Congress before the end of 2011, which
could lift Colombia's debt rating and spur a wave of investment
in the country's debt.
 ""The fundamentals couldn't be stronger. This is a country
that will get investment grade,"" Berber said.
 MEXICO SLIPS
 The Mexican currency  weakened 0.19 percent to 12.39
per dollar after weak U.S. data dented confidence in Mexico's
economy, which largely depends on U.S. demand for its exports.
 U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly slipped in December
and home prices fell in October, reports showed on Tuesday. For
details, see [ID:nN28251373]
 Mexico's peso surrendered early gains that had pushed it to
the 12.30 per dollar level for the third time in five sessions.
The Mexican currency has failed to break below the 12.30 level
since mid-November.
 The peso has closely tracked movements of the euro, and
many analysts expect to see more euro weakness due to worries
about debt problems in Spain and Portugal.
 ""People are still fearful of the situation in Europe, and
appetite for risk will not return until the new year. There is
no liquidity, there is corporate demand (for dollars) and this
will keep the exchange rate pressured,"" said Alfredo Puig, a
trader a brokerage Vector in Monterrey, Mexico.
 The Brazilian real  was bid 0.12 percent weaker at
1.690 per U.S. dollar on the local spot market while the
Chilean peso  gained 0.38 percent to 469.70 per dollar as
the price of copper, the country's main export, notched a
record high.
 ""(The peso) opened stronger and is looking for levels
around 468 per dollar. It is getting support from the dollar's
weakness against other important currencies in the world and
the increase in metal prices,"" said one currency trader in
Santiago.

1183,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2010 03:00PM ET</span>",FACTBOX-How various industries use rare earth elements," Dec 28 (Reuters) - Rare earth elements are in the the
forefront of global worries over fears that China's policy of
curbing exports will increasingly cause shortages in other
industrialized economies, given its status as the dominant
global supplier.
 China announced on Tuesday it will cut its export quotas
for rare earth minerals by more than 11 percent in the first
half of 2011, further shrinking supplies of metals needed to
make a range of high-tech products after Beijing slashed quotas
for 2010.
 Despite their name, rare earth elements are a relatively
abundant group of 17 chemical elements. They were originally
described as rare because they were unknown in their elemental
form and difficult to extract from the rocks that contained
them.
 Here is a summary of rare earth industrial applications and
some key areas where they are employed:
 Catalysts - Petroleum cracking catalysts and auto catalysts
use lanthanum and cerium.
 Glass - Cerium is the major constituent of this sector,
where it is used in ultra-violet light filtering.
 Polishing - A rapidly growing sector that is based on the
unique chemical and mechanical properties of cerium in the
polishing of glass, including multi-level electronic
components.
 Metal Alloys - Nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries are
the key driver of demand and could put pressure on lanthanum
supply.
 Magnets - Currently, the most dynamic market for rare
earths with growth in demand increasing at 15 percent a year
for the past 10 years, causing neodymium and terbium to
increase by more than 40 percent over the past 12 months.
 Phosphors - Necessary for the production of phosphors for
TVs and energy-efficient lamps. This is the smallest sector by
volume (only 6-8 percent) but the largest sector by value
(30-40 percent) as europium and terbium are among the rarest of
rare earths.
 Ceramics - Yttrium stabilized zirconia is used throughout
the resources industry where a material with high-wear
resistance is required.
 USES IN DEFENSE INDUSTRIES
 Lanthanum night-vision goggles
 Neodymium laser range-finders, guidance systems,
communications
 Europium fluorescents and phosphors in lamps and monitors
 Erbium amplifiers in fiber-optic data transmission
 Samarium permanent magnets that are stable at high
temperatures
 Samarium precision-guided weapons
 Samarium ""white noise"" production in stealth technology
 MAGNETS
 Rare earth magnets are widely used in wind turbines. Some
large turbines require two short tonnes of rare earth magnets,
which are very strong and make the turbines highly efficient.
Rare earth magnets are used in turbines and generators in many
alternative energy applications.
 HYBRID CAR BATTERIES
 Every hybrid-electric and electric vehicle has a large
battery which is made using several pounds of rare earth
compounds. The use of electric vehicles is expected to increase
rapidly, driven by energy independence, climate change and
other concerns. This is a key growth area for rare earths.
 MOBILE PHONES, LAPTOPS
 Rechargeable batteries used in mobile phone and portable
computers require rare earths, which were the key to smaller
more efficient battery technology.

 By Wanfeng Zhou and Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Dec 28 (Reuters) - The dollar set a record low
against the Swiss franc and tumbled against the yen on Tuesday
after Japan reported its factory output rose in November for
the first time in six months.
 A surprise decline in U.S. consumer confidence this month,
however, helped lift the greenback against the euro, which
swung from an overnight high of $1.3274 to a New York low below
$1.31. It last traded down 0.4 percent at $1.3108.
 Much of the day's volatile price action was tied to
year-end position squaring, traders said.
 That was the case with the Swiss franc, the biggest gainer
among major currencies, with traders citing buying by Swiss
corporates. Moves were exaggerated in very thin post-Christmas
trade, with UK markets closed for a public holiday.
 Recent yen gains have also been tied partly to year-end
repatriation flows from Japanese exporters. But traders said
the dollar's fall to a 6-1/2-week low of 81.81 yen also
reflected a 1 percent jump in Japanese industrial output in
November, reported on Tuesday.
 An earlier move below the 55-moving average of 82.59 yen,
which had served as support, accelerated the decline, though
the dollar pared losses after a weak five-year Treasury note
auction pushed up U.S. bond yields. The dollar-yen rate tends
to be closely tied to U.S. yields.
 The greenback 0.6 percent lower at 82.29 yen while the euro
hit a 3-1/2-month low around 107.64 yen.
 ""The industrial production numbers out of Japan were
extremely strong, and that certainly has provided a bid to the
yen across the board,"" said Dean Popplewell, chief strategist
of FX brokerage OANDA in Toronto.
 Against the Swiss currency, the dollar fell to 0.9435
francs, an all-time low, before clawing its way back to 0.9507
francs, but still down 0.9 percent on the day.
 DOUBTS REMAIN FOR 2011
 The dollar traded sharply lower against commodity-linked
currencies, with the Australian and New Zealand dollars both
rising sharply.
 But some analysts said investors were still wary of taking
on too much risk for fear Europe's debt crisis could worsen or
the U.S. economy could grow more slowly than expected in 2011.
 Reports showing U.S. home prices fell for a fourth straight
month in October and U.S. consumer confidence faded in December
added to the cautious sentiment and contributed to the euro's
retreat, said GFT Forex strategist Kathy Lien.
 The U.S. dollar often gains when investors grow averse to
risk because they see at as a safer option in difficult times.
 ""As much as investors want to deny it, there are still
lingering concerns about the impact of Europe's debt crisis,
about a sluggish U.S. recovery and about Chinese rate hikes,""
Lien said.
 The consumer data in particular, she added, shows Americans
""are still worried about high unemployment, housing market
stagnation and the generally meager growth they've seen.""
 The euro hit a December low last week at $1.3055, and an
earlier rise Tuesday ended just shy of $1.3278, the 50 percent
retracement of a monthly decline that started at $1.3500.
 The move raised doubts about whether the euro would be able
to target $1.3330-35, which includes a 61.8 percent retracement
of the same December decline, before year-end.
 Many analysts expect to see more euro weakness in the new
year as worries persist about debt problems in Spain and
Portugal.
 But euro bears had been frustrated by the currency's firm
support for more than a week at its 200-day moving average just
below $1.31.
 Some investors say Swiss franc gains have also been driven
by its status as a safe-haven alternative to the euro.
 The latest positioning data showed speculators increased
bets against the euro in the week ending Dec. 21, while they
trimmed bets against the U.S. dollar and boosted long positions
in the Swiss franc.

 NEW YORK, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Global stocks edged higher on
Tuesday on expectations the U.S. economy is on track for

 NEW YORK, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Global stocks edged higher on
Tuesday on expectations the U.S. economy is on track for
recovery while the dollar slipped as commodity prices surged.
 U.S. crude oil futures rose slightly above $91 a barrel,
near a 26-month high, boosted by demand for heating oil after a
blizzard hit in the U.S. East Coast and by a weaker dollar.
U.S. Treasury prices fell before a $35 billion auction of
five-year notes.
 Trading volumes in all markets were light due to the
Christmas holiday and as the northeastern United States dug
itself out from the winter storm that disrupted travel.
 ""Data in recent weeks have been supportive of the stocks
and commodity markets globally. The U.S. will avoid a
double-dip. The Asian region, including Japan, looks a little
bit better, with its industrial production finally showing an
increase,"" said David Cohen, director of Asian Economic
Forecasting at Action Economics.
 But investors were reluctant to take large new positions
after weaker-than-expected U.S. data on consumer confidence and
home prices.
 The S&P/Case Shiller home prices indexes showed prices of
U.S. single-family homes fell almost double the expected pace
in October, while confidence unexpectedly deteriorated in
December over increasing worries about jobs. For details, see

of activity,"" Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon
Partners in New York, said.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 0.91 point,

(Adds analysts, Motorola comments)
 By Tarmo Virki, European technology correspondent
 HELSINKI, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Nokia Siemens Networks' agreed
$1.2 billion acquisition of Motorola's telecom network equipment
arm has been delayed by the Chinese regulator, which has yet to
grant permission for the deal.
 The chief executive of Nokia Siemens, Nokia's network gear
unit, said he was working closely with the Anti-Monopoly Bureau
of the Ministry of Commerce of China to finalise the clearance.
 ""This delay is disappointing, but we're looking forward to
completing the acquisition early in the new year,"" Nokia Siemens
Networks CEO Rajeev Suri said in a statement on Tuesday.
 The deal will strengthen Nokia Siemens - a joint venture
between Nokia and Germany's Siemens - against its key Chinese
rivals, and make it the second-largest mobile telecom gear maker
ahead of China's Huawei.
 All other regulatory clearances for the deal which will grow
Nokia Siemens business in key markets in North America and
Japan, have been obtained, Nokia Siemens said.
 ""Nowadays Chinese approval is a pre-closing condition for
many high-tech M&A transactions, and the Chinese Ministry of
Commerce has previously shown that it takes its time even after
other regulators clear a deal,"" said Florian Mueller, consultant
on competition issues.
 ""China proved in the Panasonic-Sanyo case that it stood its
ground even after a deal had been cleared by the U.S. and the
EU, and insisted on additional remedies,"" Mueller said.
 In October 2009 China granted Panasonic Corp anti-monopoly
clearance to buy Sanyo Electric Co Ltd subject to conditions,
including cutting its stake in a battery venture with Toyota
Motor Corp.
 Motorola and NSN have had a hard time battling bigger
players to win business with large telephone companies in the
cut-throat mobile gear market, which is expected by analysts to
decline in 2010.
 Motorola has only 3 percent share of global mobile network
market, but it gives Nokia Siemens relationships with more than
50 telecom operators and to strengthen its position with major
carriers like China Mobile, Clearwire, KDDI, Sprint, Verizon
Wireless and Vodafone.
 Motorola said the delay in unit sale would not impact its
ongoing split-up.
 ""It will not affect the separation of Motorola, which is on
schedule for Jan. 4, 2011,"" said Motorola Solutions spokeswoman
Tama Mcwhinney.
 In New York Nokia shares were 0.4 percent lower at $10.18 at

 By Wanfeng Zhou and Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Dec 28 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a record low
against the Swiss franc and tumbled against the yen on Tuesday
after Japan reported its factory output rose in November for
the first time in six months.
 A surprise decline in U.S. consumer confidence this month,
however, helped the greenback recover losses against the euro,
which had climbed as high as $1.3274 overnight before falling
back to $1.3130, down 0.2 percent.
 Much of the day's price action was tied to year-end
position squaring, traders said.
 That was the case with the Swiss franc, the biggest gainer
among major currencies, with traders citing buying by Swiss
corporates. Moves were exaggerated in very thin post-Christmas
trade, with UK markets closed for a public holiday.
 Recent yen gains have also been tied partly to year-end
repatriation flows from Japanese exporters. The dollar's fall
to a 6-1/2-week low of 81.81 yen also reflected a 1 percent
jump in Japanese industrial output in November reported on
Tuesday. The dollar was last at 82.10 yen, down 0.8 percent.
 The dollar's move below the 55-day moving average of 82.59
yen, which had served as key support, accelerated the decline.
 The euro hit a 3-1/2-month low of 107.82 yen.
 ""The industrial production numbers out of Japan were
extremely strong, and that certainly has provided a bid to the
yen across the board,"" said Dean Popplewell, chief strategist
of FX brokerage OANDA in Toronto.
 Against the Swiss currency, the dollar fell to 0.9435
francs, an all-time low, before clawing its way back to 0.9509
francs, still down 0.9 percent.
 DOUBTS REMAIN FOR 2011
 The dollar traded sharply lower against commodity-linked
currencies, with the Australian and New Zealand dollars rising
nearly 1 percent on the day.
 ""Dollar weakness is basically on the back of commodities,""
Popplewell said. ""Both oil and gold are seeing robust demand.
The market seems to have shrugged off the interest-rate hike in
China over the weekend.""
 But some analysts said investors were still wary of taking
on too much risk for fear Europe's debt crisis could worsen or
the U.S. economy could grow more slowly than expected in 2011.
 Reports showing U.S. home prices fell for a fourth straight
month in October and U.S. consumer confidence faded in December
added to the cautious sentiment and contributed to the euro's
retreat, said GFT Forex strategist Kathy Lien.
 The U.S. dollar often gains when investors grow averse to
risk because they see at as a safer option in difficult times.
 ""As much as investors want to deny it, there are still
lingering concerns about the impact of Europe's debt crisis,
about a sluggish U.S. recovery and about Chinese rate hikes,""
Lien said. ""Those lingering concerns are affecting the
market.""
 The consumer data in particular, she added, shows Americans
""are still worried about high unemployment, housing market
stagnation and the generally meager growth they've seen.""
 The euro hit a December low last week at $1.3055, and an
earlier rise Tuesday ended just shy of $1.3278, the 50 percent
retracement of a monthly decline that started at $1.3500.
 The move raised doubts about whether the euro would be able
to target $1.3330-35, which includes a 61.8 percent retracement
of the same December decline, before year end.
 Many in the market expect to see more euro weakness in the
new year, amid persistent worries over debt problems for Spain
and Portugal. But euro bears had been frustrated by the
currency's firm support for more than a week at its 200-day
moving average just below $1.31.
 While much of the Swiss franc's rise has been tied to
year-end flows, some investors say it also benefits as a
safe-haven alternative to the euro.
 The latest positioning data showed speculators increased
bets against the euro in the week ending Dec. 21, while they
trimmed bets against the U.S. dollar and boosted long positions
in the Swiss franc.

 NEW YORK, Dec 28 (Reuters) - The dollar fell broadly on
Tuesday, hitting an all-time low against the Swiss franc, while
the yen rallied after data showed Japanese factory output rose
for the first time in six months in November.
 The euro gained versus the dollar after automatic buy
orders were triggered at key chart points around $1.32. It rose
as high as $1.3275 , extending its recovery from last
week's three-week low of $1.3055.
 The Swiss franc was the biggest gainer among major
currencies, with traders citing year-end buying by Swiss
corporates. Moves were exaggerated in very thin post-Christmas
trade, with UK markets closed for a public holiday, they said.

he said. ""Both oil and gold are seeing robust demand. The

 The dollar also dropped to a 6-1/2 week low around 81.81
yen  on trading platform EBS, and was last down 1.1
percent at 81.90 yen.
 Japanese industrial output rose 1.0 percent in November and
manufacturers expected to boost production in coming months,
suggesting that firm demand in Asia will help the economy
resume a recovery early next year. For details, see
[ID:nLDE6BR01R]
 The dollar slipped below a key support at its 55-day moving
average around 82.59 yen and at 82.40 yen.
 The euro  was last up 0.4 percent at $1.3211. Its
next target is $1.3278, a 50 percent retracement of its fall
earlier this month from $1.3500 to $1.3055, and then around
$1.3330-35, which includes a 61.8 percent retracement of the
same decline as well as the pair's peak in August.
 ""Essentially the euro is rising on short-covering. I think
we'll need to watch the market a bit more to see how investors
plan to allocate their money after Christmas and in the new
year,"" said Estuko Yamashita, chief economist at Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking Corp in Tokyo.
 Many in the market expect to see more euro weakness in the
new year, however, amid persistent worries over debt problems
for Spain and Portugal. But euro bears had been frustrated by
the currency's firm support for more than a week at its 200-day
moving average just below $1.31.
 SWISS FRANC GAINS
 The dollar fell to a record low against the Swiss franc
 at around 0.9435 francs. The euro fell as low as
1.2494 francs , near an all-time low of 1.2440 set
last week.
 ""Swiss franc buying is from local pension funds and
corporates. Amounts are big and could be end-of-year flows,"" a
London-based trader said.
 The Swiss franc has notched broad gains recently as
investors seek a safe-haven alternative to the euro, with
sentiment toward the single currency dented by the euro zone
debt problems.
 The latest positioning data showed speculators increased
bets against the euro in the week ending Dec. 21, while they
trimmed bets against the U.S. dollar and boosted long positions
in the Swiss franc. [IMM/FX]
 Year-end flows were broadly negative for the dollar, which
lost nearly 1 percent against a basket of currencies <.DXY> to
79.596, below its 100-day moving average around 79.808.
 Broad rises in commodity prices helped buoy the Australian
dollar  to a high around $1.0150, its strongest since
Nov. 11 and close to a 28-year high near $1.0182.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Dec 28 (Reuters) - The dollar fell broadly on
Tuesday, hitting an all-time low against the Swiss franc, which
was lifted by corporate buying, and a six-and-a-half week low
versus the yen, while the euro recovered after recent weakness.
 The Swiss franc was the biggest gainer among major
currencies, with traders citing year-end buying by Swiss
corporates. Moves were exaggerated in very thin post-Christmas
trade, with UK markets closed for a public holiday, they said.
 The euro also jumped against the dollar after stop-loss
orders were triggered at key chart points around $1.32. It rose
to $1.3274, its highest in more than a week and extending its
recovery from last week's three-week low of $1.3055.
 ""There will be some year-end positioning, but markets are
very thin which is why we are seeing quite strong movements,""
said Youna Park, Commerzbank currency strategist in Frankfurt.
 The euro was last up 0.8 percent at $1.3262.
 Its next target is $1.3278, a 50 percent retracement of its
fall earlier this month from $1.3500 to $1.3055, and then around
$1.3330-35, which includes a 61.8 percent retracement of the
same decline as well as the pair's peak in August.
 ""Essentially the euro is rising on short-covering. I think
we'll need to watch the market a bit more to see how investors
plan to allocate their money after Christmas and in the new
year,"" said Estuko Yamashita, chief economist at Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking Corp in Tokyo.
 The euro also gained against sterling, rising 0.6 percent to
a five-week high of 85.93 pence, with the British currency still
hampered by concerns that planned harsh austerity measures will
dampen an already fragile UK economic recovery.
 Many in the market expect to see more euro weakness in the
new year, however, due to worries some euro zone countries such
as Spain and Portugal may need rescue programmes, tracking a
path trodden by Greece and Ireland.
 Year-end flows were broadly negative for the dollar, which
lost close to 1 percent against a basket of currencies to
79.596, its lowest in 11 days, to take it below its 100-day
moving average around 79.808.
 
 SWISS FRANC GAINS
 The dollar fell around one and a half percent against the
Swiss franc to a low of 0.9439 francs. The euro also lost more
than 1 percent to hit a low of 1.2495 francs, near an all-time
low of 1.2435.
 ""Swiss franc buying is from local pension funds and
corporates. Amounts are big and could be end-of-year flows,"" a
London-based trader said.
 The Swiss franc has gained broadly recently as investors
seek a safe-haven alternative to the euro, with sentiment
towards the single currency dented by debt problems in
peripheral euro zone countries.
 The latest positioning data showed speculators increased
bets against the euro in the week ending Dec. 21, while they
trimmed bets against the U.S. dollar and boosted long positions
in the Swiss franc.
 Sentiment towards the euro remained fragile and many traders
think it could retest its Nov. 30 low against the dollar of
$1.2969 once it breaks out of its recent range. 
 ""The euro is oscillating in thin volumes, no new news is
expected on the euro zone periphery and it would take a strong
driver to pull the euro out of its $1.31-$1.33 range,"" said
Stephan Maier, currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 Euro bears had been frustrated by the currency's firm
support for more than a week at its 200-day moving average just
below $1.31 and were giving up their positions for now.
 The dollar also dropped to a 6-1/2 week low around 81.84 yen
, according to Reuters data, pressured by offers from Japanese
exporters, many of whom will be away later this week for the
year-end and New Year holidays.
 The dollar slipped below key support at its 55-day moving
average around 82.59 yen and at 82.40 yen, around the bottom of
a daily ichimoku cloud.
 Broad rises in commodity prices helped buoy the Australian
dollar to a high of $1.0150, its strongest since Nov. 11 and
close to a 28-year high of $1.0182.

1202,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2010 07:32AM ET</span>",Ukraine extends grain export quotas to end-March," KIEV, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Ukraine has extended grain export
quotas to include the first quarter of 2011 and increased the
volume to 4.2 million tonnes from the initial 2.7 million,
according to a government resolution published on Tuesday.
 The resolution was adopted by the government on Dec. 6 but
has not been published or enforced as yet.
 Last week Ukrainian Farm Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said
the government was reconsidering previous plans to extend grain
export quotas to the second half of the 2010/11 season.
 But earlier this month, Prysyazhnyuk said the government had
extended the quotas, set to expire on Dec. 31, until March 31,
2011.
 Ukraine's economy ministry in December proposed that the
government issue additional quotas for exports of 500,000 tonnes
of wheat and 1 million of maize to end-March.
 The initial grain export quotas allowed exports of 500,000
tonnes of wheat, 2 million of maize and 200,000 tonnes of barley
until the year-end.
 Ukraine, which exports barley, wheat and maize, is likely to
harvest about 40 million tonnes of grain in clean weight in
2010, down from 46 million in 2009 due to a severe drought.
 Ukraine exported 21.5 million tonnes of grain in the 2009/10
season.

 * Part of Beijing's plan to deepen local derivatives market
 
 (Adds background, details)
 BEIJING, Dec 28 (Reuters) - China will allow more banks to
sell currency forwards to their clients to further develop
demand and the nation's nascent derivatives market, the
country's foreign exchange regulator said on Tuesday.
 Smaller Chinese banks that were previously barred from
selling currency forwards can now partner their bigger, approved
counterparts to offer forward contracts to clients, the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange said on its website.
 To match its growing economic clout, China wants to deepen
its financial market by gently easing the government's tight
grip over the currency and interest rate regimes.
 Currently, a Chinese bank must have an annual foreign
exchange turnover of at least $20 billion before it can apply
for a licence to sell currency forwards.
 That has shut out many small banks from the forwards market.
Only 67 banks held the license in 2009.
 Bank of China is the biggest player in the forwards market
and sells forwards for a range of currencies including the U.S.
dollar, the euro, sterling, the Hong Kong dollar and the yen.
 While the yuan is still firmly controlled by China's
government, the break of its de facto peg to the U.S. dollar in
June has made it slightly more volatile.
 It has gained 3 percent since its June depeg and is a
whisker from its highest level since a landmark 2005
revaluation.
 In the long run, this should feed demand for currency
forwards among Chinese importers and exporters, most of whom are
not still not used to exchange rate fluctuations and are
inexperienced in managing currency risks.
 An expansion of the forwards market is therefore an
important step in helping Beijing fulfil its repeated vows to
free up the yuan to market forces.
 China's control over the yuan has often drawn flak from U.S.
politicians, who accuse the world's second-largest economy of
manipulating its currency to gain trade advantage.

 By Lu Jianxin and Jason Subler	
 SHANGHAI, Dec 28 (Reuters) - The yuan rose
against the dollar on Tuesday after the People's Bank of
China set its mid-point near a record high, a signal the
government's drive to contain inflation may have triggered a
new leg of appreciation.	
 The yuan is only a whisker away from its highest level
since its landmark revaluation in July 2005 and is likely to
breach that level this week after the PBOC surprised the
market by raising official interest rates on Christmas Day in
a sign of Beijing's determination to nip high inflation in the
bud.	
 Offshore yuan forwards, the main means by which foreign
investors bet on the Chinese currency, may in coming days
increasingly reflect greater appreciation over the next year.
""FX should be the last tool to manage inflation in
China. But it has come to the point that I think China won't
mind allowing more CNY appreciation to fight against imported
inflation,"" said Frances Cheung, a strategist at Credit
Agricole CIB in Hong Kong, referring to the yuan.
Adding to the timing is the forthcoming visit by
Chinese President Hu Jintao to the United States in
mid-January. China often lets the yuan appreciate slightly
ahead of major political events as a goodwill gesture to its
currency policy critics, in particular U.S. politicians.	
 An informal poll of China-based dealers over the last week
showed many of them expect the yuan to gain roughly 6 percent
next year, hitting 6.25 per dollar in late 2011, as the
exchange rate plays an increasing role in the battle against
inflation, which rose to a 28-month high in November.
[ID:nTOE6BQ01Y]	
 As such, the dealers said offshore forwards ,
now implying yuan appreciation of slightly over 2
percent against the dollar in 12 months, have sharply
underestimated the currency's potential, leaving investors a
good opportunity to short dollars in the shorter half of the
curve up to two-year forwards.	
""The government appears to have given a signal that it will
use both interest rates and the exchange rate to fight
inflation, including imported inflation,"" said a senior trader
at a Chinese commercial bank in Shenzhen.	
 ""The yuan's rise will still be measured, possibly slightly
more than 5 percent in 2011, while politics have an
intermittent impact.""	
 
 USING ALL LEVERS	
 Spot yuan closed at 6.6248 per dollar
on Tuesday, up from Monday's close of 6.6308 and only
75 pips away from its post-revaluation high of
6.6173 hit on Nov. 11.	
 It has now risen 3.04 percent since the PBOC
depegged the two currencies in mid-June.	
 The PBOC fixed the day's mid-point , from which
the yuan can rise or fall 0.5 percent in a given day, at
6.6252, up from Monday's 6.6305 and within arm's reach of its
record high of 6.6239 set on Nov. 12.	
 Traders said the yuan might not be able to effectively
breach the psychologically important level of 6.60 to the
dollar this year, with only four trading days left, but its
gain could quicken in January ahead of the Sino-U.S. summit in
Washington around Jan. 19.	
 One-year non-deliverable dollar/yuan forwards (NDFs)
were bid at 6.4800 in thin holiday
trade, up from Monday's close of 6.4720. Their implied
yuan appreciation in a year's time dropped to around 2
percent from 2.37 percent.	
 Shorter-term three-month NDFs rose to
6.5910 from Monday's close of 6.5880, implying yuan
appreciation in three months' time of 0.52 percent,
down from 0.56 percent.	
 The spread of 1-month NDFs over 1-year NDFs has narrowed
since November to 0.1355 from 0.1990 on profit-taking in the
more liquid 1-year tenors. A sustained period of stronger
mid-point fixings though, similar to September-October of this
year, could cause that spread to widen again, as investors
dump the 1-year NDFs.
""China is using all levers to temper inflation
including rate hikes and of course some CNY appreciation,""
said Gerrard Katz, head of FX trading at Standard Chartered
Bank in Hong Kong.
""So we expect to see the yuan move to 6.20 by the end
of 2011. Currently NDFs do not price that in and so there is
opportunity to sell the 1-year NDF.""

 (Updates prices; changes byline, previous TOKYO)
 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Dec 28 (Reuters) - The euro gained on Tuesday,
recovering from recent weak levels, while the dollar came under
broad selling pressure, hitting a three-week low against the yen
and a seven-week low against the Australian dollar.
 The euro jumped after stop-loss orders were triggered at key
chart points around $1.32. It rose to $1.3254, its best level in
more than a week and extending its recovery from last week's
three-week low of $1.3055.
 The move came in very illiquid markets, with public holidays
in the UK and Australia causing thin volumes and erratic trade,
while concerns about debt problems in peripheral euro zone
countries were expected to cap any euro gains.
 Euro bears had been frustrated by the currency's firm
support for more than a week at its 200-day moving average just
below $1.31 and were giving up their positions for now.
 ""Liquidity is very thin and there are no major drivers at
the moment. The euro is oscillating in thin volumes, no new news
is expected on the euro zone periphery and it would take a
strong driver to pull the euro out of its $1.31-$1.33 range,""
said Stephan Maier, currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 Many in the market expect to see more euro weakness in the
new year, however, due to worries some euro zone countries such
as Spain and Portugal may need rescue programmes, tracking a
path trodden by Greece and Ireland.
 The euro was up 0.5 percent at $1.3220.
 Its next target is $1.3278, a 50 percent retracement of its
fall earlier this month from $1.3500 to $1.3055, and then around
$1.3330-35, which includes a 61.8 percent retracement of the
same decline as well as the pair's peak in August.
 ""Essentially the euro is rising on short-covering. I think
we'll need to watch the market a bit more to see how investors
plan to allocate their money after Christmas and in the new
year,"" said Estuko Yamashita, chief economist at Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking Corp in Tokyo.
 Broad rises in commodity prices helped buoy the Australian
dollar, which was up 0.4 percent against the U.S. dollar at
$1.0084, having hit $1.0092, its strongest since Nov. 11 to take
it closer to a 28-year high of $1.0182.
 
 EURO SENTIMENT FRAGILE
 Sentiment towards the euro remained fragile and many traders
think it could retest its Nov. 30 low of $1.2969. It stayed weak
against the safe-haven Swiss franc, down 0.4 percent at 1.2580
francs.
 The latest positioning data showed speculators increased
bets against the euro in the week ending Dec. 21, while they
trimmed bets against the U.S. dollar and boosted long positions
in the Swiss franc.
 In one positive sign for the single currency, however, hedge
funds' exposure has shrunk from an overstretched position last
month to a more balanced level, said Todd Elmer, head of G10
strategy for ex-Japan Asia for Citi in Singapore.
 But he added this was just one of many preconditions the
euro must meet before returning to a recovery path.
 The dollar was down 0.6 percent against a basket of
currencies at 79.925, having hit an 11-day low of 79.838.
 The dollar also dropped to a three-week low around 82.37 yen
, down 0.5 percent on the day, pressured by offers from Japanese
exporters, many of whom will be away later this week for the
year-end and New Year holidays.
 ""U.S. bond yields fell yesterday. I think that's marginally
negative for the dollar,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank in
Tokyo.
 U.S. bond yields eased after a two-year note auction
attracted buyers, although a heavy snow storm in the
northeastern United States made a holiday market even thinner
and yields crept up slightly in Asia.
 The dollar slipped below key support at its 55-day moving
average around 82.59 yen and barely clung to support around
82.40 yen, the bottom of a daily ichimoku cloud.

 * Rare earth elements used in high-tech, clean energy
 * U.S. expert sees two-year crunch for end users
(Adds U.S. industry analyst, background)
 BEIJING, Dec 28 (Reuters) - China said on Tuesday it will
cut its export quotas for rare earth minerals by more than 11
percent in the first half of 2011, further shrinking supplies
of metals needed to make a range of high-tech products.
 China produces about 97 percent of rare earth minerals,
used worldwide in high-technology, clean energy and other
products that exploit their special properties for magnetism,
luminescence and strength.
 The rare earth issue could further strain U.S.-China ties,
which have been battered this year by arguments over human
rights, Tibet, Taiwan, the value of the Chinese currency and
North Korean military attacks on South Korea.
 Chinese President Hu Jintao is due to visit the United
States next month for talks with President Barack Obama that
both sides hope can stabilize the vital relationship.
 Beijing says its curbs are for environmental reasons and to
guarantee supplies to Chinese clean energy firms it is trying
to promote internationally. But it has also said its dominance
as a producer should give it more control over global prices.
 China's Commerce Ministry allotted 14,446 tonnes of quotas
to 31 companies, which was 11.4 percent less than the 16,304
tonnes it allocated to 22 companies in the first half of 2010
quotas a year ago.
 China slashed the export quota by 40 percent in 2010. The
export restraints on rare earths has inflamed trade ties with
the United States, European Union and Japan in particular.
 In Washington, the U.S. Trade Representative's office
expressed concern over the latest announcement.
 ""We are very concerned about China's export restraints on
rare earth materials. We have raised our concerns with China
and we are continuing to work closely on the issue with
stakeholders,"" a USTR spokeswoman said.
 Last week, the trade representative's office said China had
refused U.S. requests to end export restraints on rare earths,
and the United States could complain to the World Trade
Organization, which judges international trade disputes.
 TURBINES AND HYBRIDS
 Wind turbines and hybrid cars are among the biggest users
of rare earth minerals, which analysts say are facing a global
supply crunch as demand swells. The minerals are also used in
some weapons systems.
 This little-known class of 17 related elements is also used
for a vast array of electronic devices ranging from Apple's
iPhone to flat-screen TVs, all of which are competing for the
120,000 tonnes of annual global supply.
 While industrial users of rare earths in industrialized
countries face tighter supplies and higher prices, China's
export curbs have created opportunities to open mines or revive
dormant production in Canada, Australia and the United States.
 After China's announcement, shares of Molycorp Inc, the
Colorado-based company that owns a rare earth mine in
California, rose as much as 11.6 percent.
 But the headline-driven surge in a firm whose value has
tripled since July proved only temporary, in part reflecting
the fact that Molycorp's rare-earth mine in Mountain Pass,
California, is due to come back online only late next year.
 Canada alone has at least 26 publicly traded companies,
including Great Western Minerals Group and Rare Element
Resources, that have rare earth projects in some stage of
exploration.
 Jack Lifton of Technology Metals Research, a Chicago-based
consultancy, said Molycorp and Australia's Lynas Corporation
Ltd can eventually offset shortfalls from Chinese cuts in
supply and refining capacity -- but not before early 2013.
 ""Until one of them can produce commercial quantities of
high-purity rare earths on a regular basis, the market will
belong to the Chinese entirely,"" he said.
 In a short statement on its website (www.mofcom.gov.cn),
the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it had added more producer
companies to the quota list but cut volumes allocated to
trading companies.
 CLEAN UP, CONSOLIDATION IN CHINA
 Japan has been hard hit by the export curbs. Japanese
imports of rare earths shrank further in November, reflecting
the impact from China's de-facto ban on shipments of the
minerals that was lifted late last month.
 The European Union has also expressed concern over China's
limiting of rare earth exports, though the bloc's trade
commissioner said earlier this month China had reiterated that
rare earth supplies would be sustained.
 With more than 100 mines and some 40 refineries, ""the
Chinese seem to be quite serious about cleaning up the sector
environmentally and consolidating it,"" said Lifton.
 Beijing has been trying hard to impose discipline on its
chaotic rare earth sector and is expected to establish a rare
earth industry association by next May, said Wang Caifeng, an
official with the Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology, speaking at a conference on Tuesday.
 Tougher environmental regulations for the rare earth sector
are also expected to be unveiled next year, the China Business
News reported on Tuesday.

 Dec 28 (Reuters) - China raised its interest rates twice
this year and increased the reserve ratio six times for banks
in a bid to mop up excess liquidity in the market. Below is a
timeline of the rate changes in 2010, and market reaction.	
 Dec. 25: China's central bank lifts benchmark one-year
deposit and lending rates by 25 basis points on Christmas Day
in a bid to head off price pressures which have raced to a
28-month high.
>> Chinese investors went from relief to apprehension of more
tightening ahead, pushing the Shanghai stock market
down 1.9 percent on Monday after earlier gains. Stock market
punters initially piled into sectors seen as potentially
benefiting from higher interest rates, including banks and
insurers, but those bets reversed in the last hour of trade.	
 Chinese equities have been generally resilient to interest
rate rises. Before Saturday, A shares had risen on
average 2.9 percent in the week after the past 10 benchmark
interest rate increases in China and 7.8 percent a month
later. The Hang Seng Chinese Enterprises index had
risen on average 2.2 percent after a week and 6.3 percent
after a month.
>> Offshore yuan forwards reflected expectations
for greater appreciation in coming months.
>> The Australian dollar and commodities pared early losses as
investors bet China's latest interest rate hike would not
change the optimistic outlook for the global economy in 2011.
>> While commodity markets had expected a rate rise following
a recent shift in monetary policy, the timing was a surprise,
but markets recovered from early losses on expectations the
measures would do little to curb China's appetite for
industrial raw materials, energy, grains and other
agricultural products. [ID:nL3E6NR07X]

 Oct. 19: China's central bank raises its benchmark
one-year lending and deposit rates by 25 basis points, its
first rate hike since 2007. [ID:nSGE69I0HU] The quarter
point increase was also the first time in modern history that
Beijing adjusted deposit and lending levels by a number that
was not a multiple of nine. In the past, the central bank
typically raised rates by 27 basis points. On the abacus,
adding multiples of nine was much easier than adding multiples
of 10. [ID:nTOE69I097]
>> World stocks and commodity prices fell sharply. Crude oil
slid more than 4 percent, its biggest single-day percentage
decline in eight months, while copper tumbled from 27-month
highs and gold shed as much as 2.7 percent, its largest
one-day drop since early July. The dollar rallied broadly,
while the Australian dollar, which had just risen above parity
with the U.S. currency for the first time since 1983, was hit
hardest, slipping 1.5 percent.
>> China's bond yields surged to an eight-month
high after the central bank's surprise rate rise sparked fears
of a sustained tightening campaign, but authorities kept a lid
on the yuan to ward off hot money inflows.
>> China's stock market closed nearly flat after a day of
volatile trading during which it lost as much as 2.0 percent
but also gained as much as 1.3 percent at one point. The
Shanghai Composite Index ultimately inched up 0.1
percent for the day, as liquidity in the financial sector
remains ample despite the marginal increase in the cost of
funds.

 ***Shifts in Reserve Ratio Requirements of Chinese banks***

 Dec. 10 : China's central bank raises lenders' required
reserves by 50 basis points to 19 percent, a record high.
>> Marginal effect in financial markets dominated by other
factors like U.S. and Chinese economic data.	
 Nov. 19 : The People's Bank of China lifts required
reserve ratios by 50 basis points to 18.5 percent for big banks.
>> Stocks inched lower and commodities fell, but a tense
market remained more focused on hopes of an Irish bailout and
its broader implications for euro zone debt.	
 Nov. 10: China's central bank has ordered some banks to
lift their required reserve ratios by 50 basis points in an
apparent effort to curb rapid credit growth, three industry
sources told Reuters.
>> Stocks and copper prices fell, but more because of
slower-than-expected China import data, and continued worries
over the Irish debt problem and its fallout on the euro.

Oct. 11: China has raised reserve requirements for six
large commercial banks on a temporary basis, a surprise move
to drain cash from the economy but avoid over-tightening. The
50-basis-point increase, which takes required reserve ratios

when China raised reserve requirements, but on this occasion
investors took the news in their stride. The Australian dollar

economy -- the top Australian export destination -- came under
brief selling pressure before paring its losses.

 Feb. 12: PBOC raises banks' reserve requirements by 50

high against a currency basket and commodity prices slipped.
Markets were rattled by fears the pace of monetary tightening
in China would be more aggressive than previously thought,
potentially dampening global growth.	
 Jan. 12: China took its strongest step towards tightening
monetary policy with an increase in banks' required reserves
by 50 basis points. The move came just days after China
reported robust trade figures and was the first time that the
central bank had adjusted the ratio since a cut in December
2008, when it was loosening policy to cushion the economy from
the global financial crisis.
>> Commodity prices slid and stocks slumped around the world.
Asian stocks eased a day after hitting a 17-month high, on
investor jitters that tighter Chinese monetary policy could
slow economic expansion in China and cut the country's strong
worldwide demand for commodities and other goods.

 * Dollar hits 3-week low vs yen, 7-week low vs Aussie
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Dec 28 (Reuters) - The euro rose sharply as bears were
forced to abandon their bets on Tuesday while the dollar came
under broad selling pressure, hitting a three-week low against
the yen and a seven-week low against the Australian dollar.
 The euro jumped after stop-loss orders were triggered at key
chart points around $1.32. It rose to $1.3250, its best level in
more than a week and extending its recovery from last week's
three-week low of $1.3055.
 Euro bears had been frustrated by the currency's firm support
for more than a week at its 200-day moving average just below
$1.31 and were giving up their positions for now.
 Many in the market have been betting on more weakness in the
euro due to persistent worries that some euro zone countries such
as Spain and Portugal may need rescue programmes to finance their
debt, tracking a path trodden by Greece and Ireland.
 ""It's a flow-driven market so it's hard to tell how long this
rise in the euro will continue,"" said a trader at a European
bank, noting that a speculative player appears to have tried to
take advantage of thin trade to push up the euro.
 The euro could target $1.3278, a 50 percent retracement of
its fall earlier this month from $1.3500 to $1.3055, and then
around $1.3330-35, which includes a 61.8 percent retracement of
the same decline as well as the pair's peak in August.
 ""Essentially the euro is rising on short-covering. I think
we'll need to watch the market a bit more to see how investors
plan to allocate their money after Christmas and in the new
year,"" said Estuko Yamashita, chief economist at Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking Corp.
 Market holidays in some Commonwealth countries including
Australia and the United Kingdom have made for thin volumes and
erratic trade.
 EURO SENTIMENT FRAGILE
 Sentiment towards the euro remains fragile and many traders
think it could retest the Nov. 30 low of $1.2969.
 In one positive sign for the single currency, however, hedge
funds' exposure has shrunk from an overstretched position last
month to a more balanced level, said Todd Elmer, head of G10
strategy for ex-Japan Asia for Citi in Singapore.
 But he added that this was just one of many preconditions
that the euro must meet before returning to a recovery path.
 ""Several weeks ago, we shifted to the view there will be
downside to the euro in the short term. I'm not convinced if the
timing is yet right to switch back to a more positive view on the
euro,"" Elmer said.
 The dollar was weaker against most other major currencies,
falling to a seven-week low against the Australian dollar.
 ""U.S. bond yields fell yesterday. I think that's marginally
negative for the dollar,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 U.S. bond yields eased after a two-year note auction
attracted buyers, although a heavy snow storm in the northeastern
United States made a holiday-thinned market even thinner and
yields crept up slightly in Asia.
 The dollar also dropped to a three-week low of 82.40 yen,
down 0.5 percent on the day, pressured by offers from Japanese
exporters, many of which will be away later this week for the
year-end and New Year holidays.
 The dollar slipped below key support at its 55-day moving
average around 82.62 yen and barely clung to support around 82.40
yen, the bottom of a daily ichimoku cloud.
 The bottom of the cloud is expected to gradually rise later
in the week, rendering it thinner towards early January and
pointing to a higher risk of the dollar falling below it. That
would be considered a major bearish signal.
 The Aussie rose as high as $1.0090, its highest since
mid-November and not far from a 28-year high of $1.0182 hit in
early November.

(Updates prices)	
 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Shares in Japan and China
eased on Tuesday as concerns that further Chinese monetary
tightening will cool the engine of world economic growth
overshadowed Japanese data that pointed to improving demand.	
 The euro spiked against the dollar, although market
players attributed its strength to technical factors in light
holiday trade, and oil edged up near a 26-month high as a snow
storm in the U.S. northeast underpinned demand expectations.	
 Data from Japan showed factory output rose for the first
time in six months in November and a survey of manufacturers
revealed they expected to boost production in the coming
months to meet firm demand from the rest of Asia.	
 ""Data in recent weeks have been supportive of the stocks
and commodity markets globally,"" said David Cohen, director of
Asian economic forecasting at Action Economics.	
 ""The U.S. will avoid a double-dip. The Asian region
including Japan looks a little bit better, with its industrial
production finally showing an increase.""	
 But despite some positive signs on the outlook, investors
entering thin year-end trading remained concerned about
Chinese monetary policy tightening in the months ahead.	
 The timing of China's Christmas Day interest rate rise may
have surprised but the move itself did not, with Chinese
leaders pledged to make fighting inflation a priority in 2011.	
 World shares mostly fell on Monday in response to the
move, as investors fretted that tighter monetary policy would
moderate the growth that many are relying on to support the
global economic recovery.	
 On Tuesday, MSCI's broadest index of Asia shares outside
Japan , which is up nearly 13 percent for the
year, rose 0.1 percent.	
 But Shanghai shares fell 1 percent, after a 2
percent drop the previous day, and Tokyo's Nikkei shed
0.6 percent. 
 ""Investors locked in profits as Shanghai shares fell in
late trade yesterday,"" said Kazuhiro Takahashi, general
manager at Daiwa Capital Markets. ""They didn't want to buy
further as uncertainty remained for Chinese shares.""	
 With Australian markets closed for a holiday the main
stock gains in Asia were in South Korea, where the benchmark
index rose 0.6 percent, led by a 1.7 percent rise for
Samsung Electronics . 
 U.S. stocks finished little moved on Monday, with the Dow
Jones industrial average down 0.2 percent but the
Nasdaq Composite 0.1 percent firmer. 
 
 EURO JUMPS	
 The euro rose sharply as bears who had been betting on
further weakness due to worries about the continent's
sovereign debt crisis were forced to abandon their positions.

 The beleaguered single currency jumped to around $1.3250
after stop-loss orders were triggered at key chart positions
around $1.32, and was later trading at $1.3235.	
 ""Essentially the euro is rising on short-covering,"" said
Estuko Yamashita, chief economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corp in Japan. 
 ""I think we'll need to see the market a bit more to see
how investors plan to allocate their money after Christmas and
in the new year."" 
 The euro has been under pressure due to concerns that more
debt-soaked euro zone nations such as Portugal and Spain will
be forced to join Greece and Ireland in needing a bailout to
finance their burgeoning debt.	
 Broad weakness in the dollar helped commodities, which are
mostly priced in the U.S. currency and so become cheaper for
international investors when it falls.	
 U.S. copper futures  rallied more than half a
percent to a record high of 430.75 cents per lb and Shanghai
copper  rose 0.6 percent. Spot gold rose to $1,391.50
an ounce. 
 Oil rose 14 cents to $91.14 a barrel, as blizzards brought
knee-deep snow to the northeastern United States, the world's
biggest market for heating oil.

Asian currencies as well, with the Australian dollar rising to a
six-week high against the U.S. dollar.

 The Aussie rose to $1.0082, its highest level since
mid-November.
 The dollar also briefly dropped to a three-week low of 82.64
yen before recapturing some of its losses to trade at 82.72 yen,
down 0.1 percent on the day.
 For now, the dollar was finding support at its 55-day moving
average around 82.62 yen,
 Another support level is around 82.40 yen, the bottom of a
daily ichimoku cloud.
 Still, the bottom of the cloud is expected to gradually rise
later in the week, rendering it thinner towards early January and
pointing to a higher risk of the dollar falling below the cloud.
That would be considered a major bearish signal.
 ""The dollar/yen looks precarious on the ichimoku chart. If it
falls below 82.50 yen today, there's a greater risk of it falling
below the cloud in coming days,"" said Teppei Ino, analyst at the
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 The market showed no reaction to a raft of Japanese economic
data, which mostly met market expectations.
 Industrial production rose 1.0 percent in November and
manufacturers forecast further increases in the following months,
while core consumer prices fell 0.5 percent from a year earlier,
slightly less than the median forecast of a 0.6 percent fall.

senior official said in comments reported on Tuesday that

balanced trade ties.
 Zhong Shan, a vice commerce minister, said Beijing did indeed

 ""A balance in trade is a relative balance, not an absolute

 ""Our foreign trade growth must be faster than the overall

 The United States and Europe, among others, have long said

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, Dec 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed little
changed and the dollar lost ground to the euro in thin trade on
Monday, buffeted by China's Christmas Day interest rate hike
and a blizzard that pounded the northeastern United States.
 The quarter-point rate increase by the People's Bank of
China was the second in just over two months, and while the
timing just before year-end may have been a surprise, the move
itself was not. China's leaders have pledged to make fighting
inflation a top priority in 2011, indicating more rate rises to
come.
 Oil prices dipped after briefly hitting a 26-month peak as
the Chinese rate hike raised fears of slowing demand. Gold
prices ended down marginally.
 European stock markets fell on China's move, although with
the UK on holiday until Wednesday, trading activity was
limited.
 Despite the modest losses in some markets, many global
share price indexes hover near two-year highs.
 ""The market is pretty much flat but we ended well off our
lows and although we have no buyers stepping in, we have to
give the bulls the victory seeing how the market turned
around,"" said Ryan Detrick, technical analyst at Schaeffer's
Investment Research at Cincinnati, Ohio.
 The week between Christmas and New Year's is typically
considered ""the Santa Claus rally time,"" Detrick said, adding
that he expects gains on Wall Street to resume later in the
week.
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI>
fell 18.46 points, or 0.16 percent, to 11,555.03. The Standard
& Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> gained 0.77 points, or 0.06 percent,
to 1,257.54. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> rose 1.67
points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,667.27.
 Financial stocks rose, in part boosted by a rally in
American International Group  shares after it secured
$4.3 billion in bank credit lines, taking another step toward
winding down its U.S. government support. AIG shares gained
9.3 percent, or $5.05, to $59.38, after earlier hitting a
two-year high.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> ended 0.87 percent
lower at 1,137.49.
 The STOXX Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts index <.SXAP> was
the worst-hit sector, down 3.9 percent on concern China's rate
hike could dent demand for cars from Chinese consumer. Last
Friday's news that Beijing aims to tackle congestion in China's
capital by limiting new-car registrations also weighed on auto
shares. [ID:nTOE6BN02B]
 The pan-European index has gained 6.6 percent in December
and, in spite of the Monday's hefty fall, is still on track to
record its biggest monthly gain since March.
 China's central bank on Saturday announced a hike in the
benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to 5.81 percent and
an increase in the benchmark deposit rate by 25 basis points to
2.75 percent. [ID:nTOE6BO010]
 On Monday the PBOC took aim at inflation once again by
saying prudent monetary policy would be helpful in combating
price pressures and asset bubbles. [ID:nBJA002387]
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> rose 0.75 percent, extending its
recent outperformance in Asia. The MSCI All Country World index
<.MIWD00000PUS> dipped 0.12 percent.
 Early indications pointed to a positive opening for stocks
in Tokyo on Tuesday. The March Nikkei futures contract traded
in Chicago was up 35 points at 10,355 .
 EURO GAINS
 Normally thin post-holiday trading was made more so by the
severe weather in the U.S. northeast, hampering commuter
travel.
 The euro rose after shaking off losses below its 200-day
moving average, a move that is usually indicative of more
losses. While fears that a euro-zone debt crisis could spread
have pushed the euro below the 200-day moving average --
$1.3087, according to Reuters data -- in five of the last six
sessions, it has rebounded swiftly each time. It was last up
0.36 percent at $1.3162 .
 ""With no economic news, we're focusing on these technical
factors, and that push above the 200-day average has been a
catalyst for the euro,"" said Omer Esiner, strategist at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. ""And with London
off and the blizzard in New York, things are very subdued.""
 Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.08 at 82.79 yen .
Earlier, it had fallen to a three-week low in Asian trading
hours.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rallied 15/32 of a
point in price, pushing the yield down to 3.33 percent after a
strong auction for $35 billion in two-year paper..
 ""Despite a relatively low-volume day, it performed very
well,"" said Jim Golden, head of Treasury trading at Jefferies &
Co in New York.
 In commodities markets, oil prices pulled back from a
26-month high in response to China's action, which countered
the influence of severe cold weather in the United States and
Europe.
 U.S. crude for February  fell 51 cents to settle at
$91 a barrel, after hitting an intraday peak of $91.88 -- the
highest since October 2008.
 Spot gold prices  dropped 95 cents, or 0.07 percent,
to $1,383.13 an ounce. Bargain hunters stepped in to buy after
the initial jolt from China's rate decision.
 Grain prices were generally stronger with corn at a
29-month high and soy at a near 28-month high due to hot and
dry weather in Argentina, the No. 3 oilseed
exporter.[ID:nLDE6BQ0MT]
 Chicago Board of Trade soybeans for January  delivery
closed up 23-1/2 cents at $13.73, after posting a session high
and new contract high of $13.78-1/4, the highest point for a
spot month contract since September 2008.
 ""There is nothing like a supply-driven crop scare to trump
other factors,"" Rich Feltes, vice president of research at
brokerage R.J. O'Brien & Associates, said about Argentina.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Dec 27 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar on Monday after clawing back above its 200-day moving
average, though sentiment on the single currency remained
bearish amid worries about Portuguese and Spanish debt.
 Trading ranks were extremely thin. London was closed on
Monday and Tuesday for holidays and a blizzard in New York
limited activity, ensuring only minor price fluctuations.
 The Australian currency earlier fell as low as $0.9987
 after China's interest rate hike on Saturday, though
it had climbed back to trade slightly higher on the day.
 While fears that a euro zone debt crisis could spread have
pushed the euro below the 200-day moving average -- $1.3087,
according to Reuters data -- in five of the last six sessions,
it has rebounded swiftly each time. A drop below is usually
indicative of more losses.
 ""With no economic news, we're focusing on these technical
factors, and that push above the 200-day average has been a
catalyst for the euro,"" said Omer Esiner, strategist at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. ""And with London
off and the blizzard in New York, things are very subdued.""
 The euro  last traded at $1.3156, up 0.3 percent on
the session. It hit a three-week low of $1.3055 on trading
platform EBS last week and the currency's outlook is still
clouded by Spain and Portugal, which investors fear may have
trouble refinancing their debt in the new year.
 Speculators also boosted their bets against the euro in the
latest week, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed on Monday, suggesting sentiment remained bearish. The
data also showed an increase in long positions in the
safe-haven Swiss franc. For details, see [ID:nN27235421]
 Softer economic data from some of the weaker euro zone
economies will also likely have a bigger impact on the euro
next year than in 2010, according to strategists at BNP
Paribas.
 ""So far, the market is betting on positive spillover being
seen from core Europe (Germany) to the periphery. However, with
China tightening monetary policy, German exports will no doubt
be affected,"" they wrote to clients. ""Going into year-end, we
favor euro/dollar breaking lower from its recent trading range
targeting the 1.2970"" level.
 HIGHER CHINESE RATES
 Australia's economy has benefited from strong Chinese
demand and markets fear Beijing's attempts to dampen inflation
with higher interest rates could hurt domestic demand there.
 But traders said earlier losses in the Australian dollar
had more to do with the timing of the hike than the move
itself.
 ""There was a kneejerk sell-off in the Aussie, but investors
knew this China move was coming eventually,"" said Geoffrey Yu,
currency strategist at UBS. ""Providing Chinese data holds up in
2011, the Aussie should stay supported.""
 Danske Bank analysts said they expect three more Chinese
rate hikes in 2011, with all likely coming in the first half.
 Against the yen , the dollar was down 0.1 percent at
82.81, near the lower end of its recent 82.50-to-84.50 range.
 A rally in U.S. bond yields earlier this month prompted
many traders to bet on a rise in the dollar, but as the dollar
was unable to extend gains, traders have been cutting long
positions, analysts said.
 A correlation between the exchange rate and U.S. yields
started to weaken this month, with the dollar shedding 1 yen
last week even as the two-year Treasury yield rose by 5 basis
points. Traders, however, blamed illiquid, year-end
conditions.
 UBS said gross trading flows involving the yen were less
than 30 percent of typical weekly volume last week, adding:
""what little we did see was heavily biased toward buyers.""

 LONDON, Dec 27 (Reuters) - In the mid-1990s, around the time
when the European Union was seriously getting to grips with
creating the euro zone project, the Reuters bureau in Brussels
received a call from a British analyst working for a U.S. bank.
 The London-based currency specialist had seen EU leaders
taking a series of concrete steps towards a shared currency. His
question: ""This isn't really going to happen, is it?""
 That incredulity underlines the divide that existed then --
and still does -- between continental politicians seriously
embarked on establishing a pan-European currency and many
financiers who can't believe such a thing can work economically.
 Sceptics are currently enjoying a ""told-you-so"" moment,
watching the euro zone's indebted weaker states being hammered
by market forces, unable to devalue their way out of debt
trouble or to improve their lagging competitiveness.
 Greece and Ireland have already been forced to seek bailouts
for their over-extended debt by markets persuaded that things
cannot stay as they are. There promises to be more volatility in
the new year.
 The europhiles, meanwhile, are adamant that all is well
politically and that, slow-moving EU politics aside, when push
comes to shove the European Central Bank and the big countries
such Germany have the wherewithal and desire to fix things.
 The competing views were summed up recently by Percival
Stanion, head of allocation at London-based Baring Asset
Management, and Holger Schmieding, chief economist at German
private bank Berenberg.
 Stanion: ""We think it is very likely that it (the euro zone)
will fall apart ... I think the likelihood of a failure of the
euro is quite high.""
 Schmieding: ""Outside the euro zone, the political resolve to
keep the euro zone together is completely underestimated. It is
about the future of integration.""
 
 CHASING TAILS
 This division between economics and politics is reminiscent
of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) crisis of 1993, when
markets pushed European currencies to the edge and out of the
narrow trading bands that had been set up ahead of the euro.
 There was huge turmoil and cost -- and plenty of money to be
made for investors on the right side of the trade -- but in the
event, it was ended by a political fudge, the widening of the
bands to an almost meaningless range.
 Now the markets are on a similar roll, moving from Greece
and Ireland to Portugal, Spain and possibly elsewhere. That this
assault is to a certain extent self-fulfilling was writ large
last week by Moody's Investor Service.
 The ratings agency put Portuguese debt on review for a
possible downgrade, citing as one reason concerns about the
country's ability to access capital markets at a sustainable
interest rate.
 But it added: ""Portugal's solvency is not in question.""
 In effect this was saying that Portugal is pretty sound but
has some problems, one of which is that financial markets are
treating it as if it is not sound.
 William De Vijlder, chief investment officer of France's BNP
Paribas Investment Partners, has looked at this phenomenon on
his blog, dubbing it ""Individual rationality, collective
irrationality"".
 The idea is that most governments and authorities are doing
what is needed to stem the euro zone's problems -- austerity
programmes and the like -- but that this takes time, while
markets are notoriously short-term and relish a crisis.
 It is as if, he writes, ""A fire broke out in a room full of
people, and many were trampled to death because some had
suggested that panic would spread if the candles used as
lighting fell over.""
 
 GERMANY BECKONS
 As with the ERM crisis, the broad expectation, especially in
the euro zone itself, is that the various authorities will
eventually act to shore up the indebted countries in a way that
will make it too risky for markets to put on pressure.
 You only have to ask whether anyone -- from Germany to
Greece -- would be better off without the euro zone.
 The former would lose the advantage of a shared currency
with its major trading partners; the latter would be cut loose
from whatever discipline being in the euro zone gives it,
sending it back to emerging market obscurity.
 But there are differences between the ERM days and now,
which may undermine, or at least weaken, the argument that
politics will triumph over economic scepticism.
 The drivers behind European integration are not what they
were. For one, Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, does not
project the same zeal as her 1990s predecessor Helmut Kohl for
building the single European house.
 Germany, it has been suggested, may even be more interested
in economically booming China today than it is in Europe.
 And while it was hard for Germany to merge its strong mark
currency with less robust counterparts, this sacrifice could
pale in comparison with the potential cost of bailing out the
euro zone in the same way as it did East Germany.
 The economic view tends to be that if it comes to the
crunch, the German people will not be willing to bail out
recalcitrant nations outside their borders.
 Many of those who assume a political bailout will be
forthcoming admit that the drive has weakened. But they still
say that Germany and other major euro zone powers will not let
the euro fail.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Dec 27 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar on Monday after clawing back above its 200-day moving
average, though sentiment on the single currency remained
bearish amid worries about Portugal's and Spain's debt.
 Trading ranks were extremely thin. London was closed on
Monday and Tuesday for holidays and a blizzard in New York
limited activity, ensuring only minor price fluctuations.
 The Australian currency earlier fell as low as $0.9987
 after China's interest rate hike on Saturday, though
it had climbed back to trade slightly higher on the day.
 While fears that a euro zone debt crisis could spread have
pushed the euro below the 200-day moving average -- $1.3087,
according to Reuters data -- in five of the last six sessions,
it has rebounded swiftly each time. A drop below is usually
indicative of more losses.
 ""With no economic news, we're focusing on these technical
factors, and that push above the 200-day average has been a
catalyst for the euro,"" said Omer Esiner, strategist at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. ""And with London
off and the blizzard in New York, things are very subdued.""
 The euro last traded at $1.3148 , up 0.3 percent. The
euro hit a three-week low of $1.3055 on trading platform EBS
last week, and its outlook is still clouded by Spain and
Portugal, which investors fear may have trouble refinancing
their debt in the new year.
 Softer economic data from some of the weaker euro zone
economies will also likely have a bigger impact on the euro
next year than in 2010, strategists at BNP Paribas said.
 ""So far, the market is betting on positive spillover being
seen from core Europe (Germany) to the periphery. However, with
China tightening monetary policy, German exports will no doubt
be affected,"" they wrote to clients. ""Going into year end, we
favor euro/dollar breaking lower from its recent trading range
targeting the 1.2970 (level).""
 HIGHER CHINESE RATES
 Australia's economy has benefited from strong Chinese
demand, and markets fear China's attempts to dampen inflation
with higher interest rates could hurt domestic Chinese demand.
 But traders said earlier losses in the Australian dollar
had more to do with the timing of the hike than the move
itself.
""There was a knee-jerk sell-off in the Aussie but investors
knew this China move was coming eventually,"" said Geoffrey Yu,
currency strategist at UBS. ""Providing Chinese data holds up in
2011, the Aussie should stay supported.""
 Danske Bank analysts said they expect three more Chinese
rate hikes in 2011, with all likely coming in the first half.
 Against the yen, the dollar was down 0.1 percent at 82.78
, near the lower end of its recent 82.50 to 84.50 range.
 A rally in U.S. bond yields earlier this month prompted
many traders to bet on a rise in the dollar. But as the dollar
was unable to extend gains, traders have been cutting long
positions, analysts said.
 A correlation between the exchange rate and U.S. yields
started to weaken this month, with the dollar shedding 1 yen
last week even as the two-year Treasury yield rose by 5 basis
points. But traders blamed illiquid, year-end conditions.
 UBS said gross trading flows involving the yen were less
than 30 percent of typical weekly volume last week, though
""what little we did see was heavily biased toward buyers."" That
pushed the bank's clients ""a little deeper into net long yen
territory, but these positions are still quite shallow.""

crude oil to Belarus on behalf of Venezuela and, in return, the
Latin American country will provide oil to meet Azerbaijan's
export commitments to the United States, state energy company
SOCAR said.
 ""We signed swap deals between Azerbaijan, Belarus and
Venezuela on oil supplies in the amount of 5.0 million tonnes of
oil per year from 2011,"" the head of SOCAR, Rovnag Abdullayev,
told journalists on Monday.
 He said that Azerbaijan would supply Belarus and get oil
from Venezuela, delivering it to the United States on tankers.
 The oil destined for Belarus would be sent through Ukraine
via the pipeline from Odessa on the Black Sea to Brody, he said.
 During a visit to Minsk in October, Venezuelan President
Hugo Chavez agreed to supply the former Soviet republic with 30
million tonnes of oil over three years from 2011 in a deal worth
as much as $19.4 billion.
 Venezuela's oil minister, Rafael Ramirez, said later that
his country would boost crude oil exports to Belarus by 150
percent next year to 200,000 barrels per day
 Although Belarus reached a deal on oil export duties with
Moscow this month, potentially removing one area of tension over
energy supplies, Minsk has been keen to diversify some of its
sources of oil away from Russia.
 SOCAR's Abdullayev said another deal, to deliver Azeri Light
crude oil, was reached with China and Taiwan during a visit he
made to the region earlier this month.
 ""It will also help to diversify our oil deliveries,"" he
said.
 Azerbaijan's oil production rose 13.5 percent in 2009 to
50.376 million tonnes, breaching the figure of 1 million barrels
per day for the first time. The country plans to produce 52.0
million tonnes of oil in 2010.
 Ex-Soviet Azerbaijan ships its oil via five main routes -
Russia's largest Black Sea port of Novorossiisk, neighbouring
Georgia's Supsa, Batumi and Kulevi ports, and Turkey's Ceyhan.

 NEW YORK, Dec 27 (Reuters) - China's Christmas Day interest
rate rise and a severe blizzard that blanketed the northeastern
United States left U.S. share prices weak and the U.S. dollar
lower in thin markets on Monday.
 European stock markets fell in response to China's move,
although with the UK on holiday until Wednesday, trading
activity was limited even more.
 Stocks and commodities, while weak on Monday, hovered just
underneath better than two year highs.
 China's rate increase on Dec. 25 is the second in just over
two months and represents the central bank's stepped up efforts
to slow the pace of rising inflation. [ID:nTOE6BO010]
 The euro rose to its best levels in a week against the
greenback, although oil prices pulled back from 26-month highs
in light of China's rate move which countered the influence of
severe cold weather in the United States and Europe.
 Tighter Chinese monetary policy, which theoretically would
slow the pace of economic growth, is being felt far and wide
given the nation's growing influence in commodity markets as
well as development in emerging markets.
 It also fills a void left by struggling developed markets
whose sub-trend economic growth is expected to linger due to
the ongoing debt crisis.
 ""In the long run, this is going to be healthy for the
Chinese economy, but the instinctive market reaction is that
this is going to be bad for global demand, giving investors a
reason to sell off equities,"" said Quincy Krosby, market
strategist with Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.

 EURO GAINS
 The normally thin post-holiday market was made even more so
by a severe blizzard that shut down some commuter transport
networks, making New York trading desks operate on skeletal
staffing.
 The euro rose after shaking off losses below its 200-day
moving average -- $1.3087, according to Reuters data.
 A move below that level is usually indicative of more
losses. While fears that a euro zone debt crisis could spread
have pushed the euro below the 200-day moving average in five

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Dec 27 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar steadied on
Monday, paring losses made after China's central bank raised
rates at the weekend in a move seen largely priced in, while
other major currency pairs held tight ranges in quiet trade.
 The euro inched higher against the dollar in low volume
trading with London markets shut on Monday and Tuesday and
liquidity expected to be at a premium until the new year.
 While the market had been expecting Beijing to tighten
further, the timing was a surprise as there had been doubts
whether it would raise rates before the end of the year.
 Saturday's move by the Chinese central bank to raise
interest rates was the second in just over two months,
underscoring its desire to dampen domestic demand and get price
pressures under control.
 Australia has benefited from strong Chinese demand for iron
ore and other commodities.
 ""There was a knee-jerk sell-off in the Aussie but investors
knew this China move was coming eventually. Providing the
Chinese data holds up in 2011, the Aussie should stay
supported,"" said Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at UBS.
 The news knocked the Australian dollar as low as $0.9987 in
Asia but it recouped its losses to trade flat in European trade
at $1.0035, not far from a six-week high of $1.0067 hit last
Thursday.
 ""The pace of (China) rate hikes has so far been relatively
aggressive. Nonetheless, we still expect only three rate hikes
next year and they will probably be frontloaded in H1 2011. We
expect the PBoC to be on hold through most of H2 2011 as
inflation again starts to ease,"" said analysts at Danske Bank in
a note to clients.
 EURO EDGES HIGHER
 The euro was up around 0.3 percent versus the dollar at
$1.3158, holding above a three-week low of $1.3055 hit last
week, but clouded by worries over debt refinancing requirements
of countries such as Spain and Portugal into the new year.
 Markets have put Spain's debt issuance plans under
particular scrutiny since Ireland applied for a bailout, forcing
up the Spanish government's borrowing costs.
 Technical analysts said the outlook was brighter for the
single currency while it held above its 200-day moving average
at $1.3087.
 The dollar slipped slightly against the Japanese yen,
touching a three-week low of 82.66 yen. It was last at 82.82,
close to unchanged for the day.
 Although stuck in a range of 82.50 to 84.50 yen, the dollar
has been ticking down in the past couple of weeks as holders of
long positions have given up hopes of pushing it beyond 85 yen.
""A sharp rise in U.S. bond yields earlier this month has
prompted many traders to bet on a rise in the dollar. But as the
dollar was unable to extend gains, traders have been cutting
long positions,"" said Katsunori Kitakura, chief dealer at Chuo
Mitsui Trust Bank.
 The dollar/yen rate has had a high correlation with U.S.
bond yields, particularly for two-year notes, but the
relationship has weakened this month.
 Last week it broke down as the two-year U.S. yield rose more
than 5 basis points while the dollar fell 1 yen.
 But many traders attribute that to illiquid year-end market
conditions and expect the correlation to return when market
players are back from holiday.
 An auction of $35 billion in two-year U.S. Treasuries later
in the day will be closely watched for clues on where U.S. bond
yields may be headed after a volatile month in the bond market.

 By Mike Peacock
 LONDON, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Chinese shares slid and European
stocks followed suit on Monday as the impact of China's
Christmas Day interest rate rise sunk in to thin markets.
 Chinese shares dropped 1.9 percent after the People's Bank
of China raised interest rates on Saturday for the second time
in just over two months.
 European stocks were 0.7 percent lower by 1025 GMT in
trading pared to the bone by a market holiday in Britain.
 The PBOC said it would raise the benchmark lending rate by
25 basis points to 5.81 percent and lift the benchmark deposit
rate by 25 basis points to 2.75 percent.
 Analysts expect more to come in 2011 as the Chinese
authorities battle to keep a lid on inflation, which hit a
28-month high of 5.1 percent in November.
 ""Our economists had expected a rate rise before the end of
the year, but releasing the news on Christmas Day itself came as
a little surprise to the market,"" said Chen Xin Yi, associate
vice president at Barclays Capital in Singapore.
 ""Nevertheless, we believe that the well-calibrated timing
reflects consideration for minimising unwanted financial market
volatility and reducing potential capital movement to the extent
possible.""
 Asian shares excluding China bucked the downward trend.
 The MSCI index of Asian stocks outside Japan rose 0.1
percent with Japan's Nikkei closing up 0.75 percent, extending
its recent outperformance in Asia.
 U.S. stock index futures pointed to a lower open on Wall
Street, with futures for the S&P 500 down 0.43 percent and Dow
Jones futures down 0.36 percent at 1025 GMT.
 China's central bank took aim at inflation once again on
Monday by saying prudent monetary policy would be helpful in
combating price pressures and asset bubbles.
 Hu Xiaolian, a deputy governor, said China had been
normalising policy and will explore new ways to manage excess
cash, which is seen as a major driver behind inflation.
 
 AUSSIE DOLLAR STEADIES, EURO EDGES UP
 The Australian dollar steadied, having been knocked by
China's move. Australia has benefited from strong Chinese demand
for iron ore and other commodities.
 ""There was a knee-jerk sell-off in the Aussie but investors
knew this China move was coming eventually. Providing the
Chinese data holds up in 2011, the Aussie should stay
supported,"" said Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at UBS.
 The Aussie dollar fell as low as $0.9987 before
recouping losses to trade at $1.0039 in European trade.
 The euro edged higher against the dollar in low volume trade
with London markets shut Monday and Tuesday, while the yen hit a
three-week high versus the greenback.
 Commodity markets were resilient.
 Spot gold regained lost ground after prices dropped about
one percent in early trade in response to China's rate rise.
Gold fell to a one-week low of $1,371.10, before recovering to
$1,383.68 by 1025 GMT.
 Oil climbed to a 26-month high as a blizzard in the U.S.
Northeast offset uncertainty over Chinese fuel demand.

 LONDON, Dec 27 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar steadied on
Monday, paring losses made after China's central bank raised
rates at the weekend in a move seen largely priced in, while
other major currency pairs lacked momentum in quiet trade.
 The euro edged higher against the dollar in low volume trade
with London markets shut Monday and Tuesday, while the yen hit a
three-week high versus the greenback.
 While the market had been expecting Beijing to tighten
further, the timing was a surprise as there had been doubts
whether it would raise rates before the end of the year.
 Saturday's move by the Chinese central bank to raise
interest rates was the second in just over two months,
underscoring its desire to dampen domestic demand and get price
pressures under control.
 Australia has benefited from strong Chinese demand for iron
ore and other commodities.
 ""There was a knee-jerk sell-off in the Aussie but investors
knew this China move was coming eventually. Providing the
Chinese data holds up in 2011, the Aussie should stay
supported,"" said Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at UBS.
 The news knocked the Australian dollar as low as $0.9987
but it recouped its losses to trade flat in European trade at
$1.0035, not far from a six-week high of $1.0067 hit last
Thursday.
 Some traders saw any dip in the Aussie as a good
bargain-hunting opportunity, as has been the case since early
2009.
 ""I guess the market is growing immune to China's credit
tightening. Today the Aussie fell just because there aren't many
players around,"" said a trader at a Japanese brokerage house.
 EURO EDGES HIGHER
 The euro was up around 0.2 percent versus the dollar at
$1.3145, holding above a three-week low of $1.3055 hit last
week, but clouded by worries over debt refinancing requirements
of countries such as Spain and Portugal into the new year.
 Technical analysts said the outlook was brighter for the
single currency while it held above its 200-day moving average
at $1.3087.
 The dollar slipped slightly against the Japanese yen,
touching a three-week low of 82.66 yen.
 Although stuck in a range of 82.50 to 84.50 yen, the dollar
has been ticking down in the past couple of weeks as holders of
long positions have given up hopes of pushing it beyond 85 yen.
 ""A sharp rise in U.S. bond yields earlier this month has
prompted many traders to bet on a rise in the dollar. But as the
dollar was unable to extend gains, traders have been cutting
long positions,"" said Katsunori Kitakura, chief dealer at Chuo
Mitsui Trust Bank.
 The dollar/yen rate has had a high correlation with U.S.
bond yields, particularly for two-year notes, but the
relationship has weakened this month.
 Last week it broke down as the two-year U.S. yield rose more
than 5 basis points while the dollar fell 1 yen.
 But many traders attribute that to illiquid year-end market
conditions and expect the correlation to return when market
players are back from holiday.
 An auction of $35 billion in two-year U.S. Treasuries later
in the day will be closely watched for clues on where U.S. bond
yields may be headed after a volatile month in the bond market.

 HONG KONG, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Asian shares edged up while
the Australian dollar and commodities pared early losses as
investors bet China's latest interest rate hike would not
change the optimistic outlook for the global economy in 2011.	
 People's Bank of China raised rates by 25 basis points on
Saturday, the second rate rise in just over two months, as
part of a series of measures designed to combat inflation
which hit a 28-month high of 5.1 percent in November.

 ""Nevertheless, we believe that the well-calibrated timing

 The MSCI index of Asian stocks outside Japan
rose 0.2 percent. Major markets such as Hong

 ""The impact of today's rate move on the real economy's
growth momentum is likely to be minimal."" said Qian Wang,
chief China economist at JP Morgan.	
 
 China's key stock index pared earlier gains and
yuan forwards were modestly higher. The Shanghai Composite was
down 0.3 percent, with weak small and mid-cap shares
offsetting mild gains in banking and insurance
shares.[ID:nBJD000151]	
 Japan's Nikkei closed up 0.75 percent, extending
its recent outperformance versus other Asian markets. The
Nikkei is up over 10 percent this quarter versus a 5.4 percent
rise for the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index.	
 Still, Japanese investors are entering 2011 in a bullish
mood, raising equity holdings to a 10-month high, increasing
exposure to high-yield credit and cutting back on government
debt, Reuters polls showed last week. [ID:nLDE6BL0B2]	
 S&P futures  were a shade lower, down 0.2 percent.	
 
 FUNDAMENTALS SUPPORT COMMODITIES	
 Commodity markets pared early losses in response to an
interest rate rise by PBOC, focusing instead on positive
fundamentals and threats to supply.	
 U.S. wheat  had dropped by more than 2 percent at the
open before recovering to $7.81-3/4 a bushel, down 0.2
percent, while spot gold was trading flat after
dropping to a one-week low of $1,371.1 earlier.	
 Crude oil futures  reversed early falls, rising 0.3
percent to a two-month high.	
 The Australian dollar was flat after slipping in
early trading on expectations that more tightening by China
could prompt investors to sell the Aussie after the year-end
break.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Dec 27 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar dipped on
Monday after China's central bank raised rates at the weekend,
and some analysts say the chance of more tightening in China
could prompt investors to sell the Aussie after the year-end
holidays.
 The yen also hit a three week high against the dollar,
although thin trading conditions are likely to have exaggerated
price moves.
 While the market had been expecting Beijing to tighten
further, the timing was a surprise as there had been doubts
whether it would raise rates before the end of the year.
 Saturday's move by the Chinese central bank to raise interest
rates was the second in just over two months, underscoring its
desire to dampen domestic demand and get price pressures under

 Australia has benefited from strong Chinese demand for iron
ore and other commodities.
 The news knocked the Australian dollar as low as $0.9987 in
thin, erratic trade, with many of the region's financial centres
on holiday, including Sydney and Hong Kong.
 The currency later recouped some of its losses to trade at
$1.0035, down 0.2 percent from around $1.0053 late on Friday and
a six-week high of $1.0067 the day before.
 ""China looks set to tighten its policy further in the next
year, which will have a negative impact on the Aussie given
Australia's strong economic ties with China. When many investors
come back from holiday next week they may start the year by
selling the Aussie,"" said Yuki Sakasai, a foreign exchange
strategist at Barclays Capital.
 While Australia's relatively sound fiscal position, its
strong growth and higher yields are likely to lure investors, the
Aussie may come under pressure particularly against other
commodity currencies such as the Canadian dollar, Sakasai said.
 But other traders saw any dip in the Aussie only as a good
bargain-hunting opportunity, as has been the case since early
2009.
 ""I guess the market is growing immune to China's credit
tightening. Today the Aussie fell just because there aren't many
players around,"" said a trader at a Japanese brokerage house.
 THIN CONDITIONS
 Thin trading conditions are expected to persist for the rest
of the week due to various holidays in many countries. London is
closed on Monday and Tuesday while Tokyo will be shut on Friday.
 The dollar slipped slightly against the Japanese yen,
touching a three-week low of 82.75 yen in thin trade.
 Although stuck in a range of 82.50 to 84.50 yen, the dollar
has been ticking down in the past couple of weeks as holders of
long positions have given up hopes of pushing it beyond 85 yen.
 Offers by Japanese exporters kept the dollar in check and
some traders see those offers potentially weighing on the U.S.
currency this week.
 ""A sharp rise in U.S. bond yields earlier this month has
prompted many traders to bet on a rise in the dollar. But as the
dollar was unable to extend gains, traders have been cutting long

 An auction of $35 billion in two-year U.S. Treasuries later
in the day will be closely watched for clues on where U.S. bond
yields may be headed after a volatile month in the bond market.
 Support for the dollar is seen around 82.60 yen, its 55-day
moving average, and then around 82.40 yen, the bottom of a daily
ichimoku cloud as well as the tenkan line on the weekly ichimoku
chart.
 But the bottom of the cloud is expected to gradually rise
later in the week, rendering it thinner towards early January and
pointing to a higher risk of the dollar falling below the cloud.
That would be considered a major bearish signal.
 The euro ticked up 0.2 percent to $1.3144, although it had
dipped slightly when traders successfully gunned for stop-loss
orders around $1.31.
 The euro looks vulnerable due to worries over some euro zone
countries' problems with debt financing, but the absence of many
market players this week may help the currency hold above last
week's three-week low of $1.3055, traders said.
 The euro has been supported at its 200-day moving average,
which stood at $1.3093 on Monday.

1289,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2010 07:00PM ET</span>",RPT-Q+A-How will markets respond to China's rate rise?," (Repeats item first published on Sunday with no changes to
text)	
 By Jason Subler and Vikram Subhedar	
 SHANGHAI/HONG KONG, Dec 26 (Reuters) - China's central
bank raised interest rates on Christmas Day, moving sooner
than many analysts and market participants had expected to
ramp up its campaign to combat inflation.	
 Many observers had thought the People's Bank of China
(PBOC) might hold off in raising rates for a second time since
mid-October until at least the new year, especially after
Chinese money market rates spiked last week, meaning many
investors will have been taken off guard by the latest step.	
 Here are some questions and answers on how markets may
respond to the move.	
 
 HOW WILL CHINESE SHARES REACT?	
 Broadly, a 25 basis point move is too small to spark a
sustained, sharp selloff. While a knee-jerk move lower in
Shanghai at Monday's open is possible, optimism for Chinese
shares in 2011 is likely to encourage investors to ""buy the
dip"" and send Shanghai markets higher even on the day. That
may send Hong Kong's market, closed on Monday, higher on
Tuesday.	
 Sectors most at risk of a leg down are commodity-related
firms, which have outperformed this quarter as commodity and
energy prices have rallied into the year-end.	
 The sub-index of energy shares in Hong Kong is up
11.1 percent this quarter. The CSI Energy Index of
shares listed on the mainland is up 22.5 percent. Surging
gold, silver and copper prices have boosted shares of mining
companies. That trade is likely to see some unwinding.	
 The impact on Chinese banking shares, the most heavily
weighted sector on the Shanghai and Hong Kong markets, is
likely to be neutral in the near term. Rising interest rates
are seen benefitting banks' net interest margins but
uncertainty over new lending quotas and further tightening
will likely cap gains.	
 On the charts, the Shanghai Composite as well as the Hang
Seng indexes are looking a little weak in the near-term. The
Shanghai Composite closed below its 250-day moving average on
Friday, while the Hang Seng is forming a topping ""head and
shoulders"" pattern on the daily as well as weekly charts.	

 WHAT ABOUT OTHER ASIAN EQUITIES?	
 Asian markets will lead the reaction to the latest rate
rise from China. Japan's Nikkei will be the first
major Asian index to open along with Korea's KOSPI .	
 While the Nikkei could open weaker, that is unlikely to
disturb the steady rise seen over the past seven weeks. It has
in fact outperformed the rest of Asia since China's rate
increase in October. The Nikkei is up about 10 percent since
then versus a 2.7 percent rise for the MSCI Asia ex-Japan
.	
 Southeast Asian stocks are likely to see some of their
stellar annual gains trimmed. Indonesian and Thai
markets are among the world's top performers this year
as foreign investors pumped money into emerging markets,
particularly in Asia.	
 The last Chinese rate increase in October came after
Chinese markets had closed for the day. The move prompted a
bit of a slump in Europe and the United States, with markets
unsure how Chinese investors would react. The Shanghai
Composite opened higher the following day, helping to
stabilise other markets. This time, Chinese markets will
likely lead the reaction: a measured reaction in China would
set the tone for the rest of the markets.	
 
 WILL CHINA'S RATE RISE HURT COMMODITIES?	
 Commodity markets in China will likely see a sharp
negative correction on Monday, with a chance some could test
recently expanded downside limits. The opportunity to cash in
on prices at or near their highest in years before the year
end could mean the correction this time may be greater than
the losses following the last interest rate rise in October.	
 That sent the dollar higher, dragged gold down by more
than 2 percent, oil fell 4 percent, copper lost almost 2.5
percent, while wheat fell 2.7 percent and corn, 2 percent.	
 But analysts said it did not spell the end of the
commodities rally, as corrections in markets, including
copper, corn and soy -- key imports for China -- would be
viewed as buying opportunities. 
 
 HOW BIG WILL THE REACTION BE IN G10 CURRENCIES?	
 Reduced trading volumes because of holidays in major
financial centres will limit the reaction in G10 currency
markets and make price action whippy.	
 The biggest reaction may be in the Australian dollar
because of the big trade ties between China and
Australia and the market's use of the Aussie as a proxy for
the Chinese economy. The rate increase could catch traders off
guard and lead to profit taking on bets on the Aussie.	
 The Aussie has gained the most against the dollar in
December among G10 peers, up 4.8 percent to US$1.0053,
benefitting from a late-year comeback in risk taking. It has
also in the last few weeks become an even more popular play
against the euro, rising nearly 4 percent to AU$1.3035 per euro.	
 Aussie/U.S. dollar has hit a higher daily low for the past
six trading days - so a move below Friday's US$1.0018 low
would suggest the upward trend is losing momentum.	
 
 HOW WILL YUAN NDFS REACT?	
 The rate rise may be a catalyst for further downward
pressure on dollar/yuan non-deliverable forwards. The most
liquid one-year tenor , which finished trading on
Friday at 6.50, may see the biggest decline in coming days.	
 The combination of two interest rate rises and three bank
reserve requirement increases in the last two months suggests
Beijing is focused squarely on inflation and may indeed use
the yuan to help fight imported inflation from rising oil and
other commodity prices, allowing it to rise more in coming
months.	
 That could set the NDF market up for a moderate correction.	
 The one-year NDF implied expectations the yuan would
appreciate as much as 4.3 percent against the dollar in late
October, before a series of weaker mid-point fixings triggered
early year-end profit taking, bringing implied appreciation in
a year's time to 2.1 percent.

 By Emily Kaiser
 WASHINGTON, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Call it the year of feast
and famine.
 Many of the world's big advanced economies have pledged
frugality for 2011 while fast-growing emerging markets run the
risk of overheating. The global economy must withstand both
forces in order to live up to growth expectations.
 Dictionary company Merriam-Webster ranked ""austerity"" as
its No. 1 word of the year for 2010 because so many people
looked up the definition on the company's website when Europe's
debt troubles exploded. (This wasn't the first time the global
economy featured so prominently. Two years ago, the top word
was ""bailout."")
 Many of those austerity promises kick in next year.
Portugal has proposed 5 percent pay cuts for civil servants.
Spain's parliament approved a budget that includes a 7.9
percent reduction in public spending. Ireland plans to cut 4
billion euros in spending. [ID:nLDE6BL1MQ]
 Those budgetary measures are part of the reason why
economists polled by Reuters think the euro zone economy will
slow to a 1.5 percent rate next year, down slightly from 2010's
already sluggish 1.7 percent pace.

 IFR Markets Week Ahead PDF: http://r.reuters.com/mep53r
 
 The risk is that a synchronized round of fiscal constraint
puts an even bigger-than-anticipated drag on growth.
 The International Monetary Fund estimates that after two
years, a budget deficit cut of 1 percent of GDP lowers economic
output by one-half of a percentage point and raises
unemployment by one-third of a point.
 The United States faces its own austerity fight as
Republicans in Congress push for spending cuts. U.S. economic
growth for 2011 looks somewhat stronger than Europe's although
still well short of what is needed to repair the job market.
 Sung Won Sohn, a California State University economist,
expects 3 percent growth next year but says the lack of jobs
remains the ""Achilles heel"" of the economy.
 Sohn, who is also vice chairman of clothing retail chain
Forever 21, said the poor labor market may constrain consumer
spending next year despite a surprisingly strong 2010 holiday
shopping season.
 ""American consumers want to save more, pay down the debt
and put their financial house in better shape,"" he said. ""As
long as the consumers are in a cautious mood, in part emanating
from the lackluster job picture, it is hard to have healthy
economic growth.""
 GOODBYE G7, HELLO G20
 It is no secret that emerging markets are growing far more
quickly than advanced economies. The IMF estimates emerging
markets will grow by 6.4 percent next year, almost three times
the rate of developed nations.
 Overall, the IMF expects 4.2 percent global growth for next
year, which would be a step down from 2010 but well above the
recession-hit rates of the previous two years.
 Strong performances in China, Brazil and India have boosted
global trade, helping to prop up growth in the United States,
Europe and Japan.
 ""Goodbye G7 and hello G20!"" said Andreas Utermann, chief
investment officer of fund firm RCM, referring to the Group of
7 developed economies and the larger G20 club of rich and
emerging nations.
 Those diverging growth rates have fostered another
troublesome feast-and-famine zone -- commodity prices. The
price of oil edged closer to triple digits last week and food
prices are also on the rise, in part because of strong demand
from emerging markets.
 China has taken steps to try to cool down its inflation
without putting too much of a chill on the broader economy, and
economists widely expect more tightening next year.
 In the United States, however, the Federal Reserve still
sees deflation as a bigger threat than inflation, and recently
recommitted to buying $600 billion in assets to try to spur
stronger growth.
 The Fed typically focuses on ""core"" inflation that excludes
volatile food and energy prices, but consumers eat and drive
and must therefore budget for higher costs. If those prices
continue to rise, that could dampen spending.
 The Fed's deflation-fighting efforts drew criticism at home
and abroad that it would unleash a potentially inflationary
flood of cheap money into the world economy without doing much
to lift U.S. growth or lower unemployment.
 RCM's Utermann said the Fed's program may lead to
""sub-optimal investment decisions"" that create dangerous asset
price bubbles elsewhere.
 ""We need to look out for signs of bubble creation ... in
commodities, emerging market property, or long-term
(government) debt -- and brace ourselves for continued very
volatile capital market conditions.""

 SHANGHAI/HONG KONG, Dec 26 (Reuters) - China's central
bank raised interest rates on Christmas Day, moving sooner
than many analysts and market participants had expected to
ramp up its campaign to combat inflation.	
 Many observers had thought the People's Bank of China
(PBOC) might hold off in raising rates for a second time since
mid-October until at least the new year, especially after
Chinese money market rates spiked last week, meaning many
investors will have been taken off guard by the latest step.	
 Here are some questions and answers on how markets may
respond to the move.	
 
 HOW WILL CHINESE SHARES REACT?	
 Broadly, a 25 basis point move is too small to spark a
sustained, sharp selloff. While a knee-jerk move lower in
Shanghai at Monday's open is possible, optimism for Chinese
shares in 2011 is likely to encourage investors to ""buy the
dip"" and send Shanghai markets higher even on the day. That
may send Hong Kong's market, closed on Monday, higher on
Tuesday.	
 Sectors most at risk of a leg down are commodity-related
firms, which have outperformed this quarter as commodity and
energy prices have rallied into the year-end.	
 The sub-index of energy shares in Hong Kong is up
11.1 percent this quarter. The CSI Energy Index of
shares listed on the mainland is up 22.5 percent. Surging
gold, silver and copper prices have boosted shares of mining
companies. That trade is likely to see some unwinding.	
 The impact on Chinese banking shares, the most heavily
weighted sector on the Shanghai and Hong Kong markets, is
likely to be neutral in the near term. Rising interest rates
are seen benefitting banks' net interest margins but
uncertainty over new lending quotas and further tightening
will likely cap gains.	
 On the charts, the Shanghai Composite as well as the Hang
Seng indexes are looking a little weak in the near-term. The
Shanghai Composite closed below its 250-day moving average on
Friday, while the Hang Seng is forming a topping ""head and
shoulders"" pattern on the daily as well as weekly charts.	

 WHAT ABOUT OTHER ASIAN EQUITIES?	
 Asian markets will lead the reaction to the latest rate
rise from China. Japan's Nikkei will be the first
major Asian index to open along with Korea's KOSPI .	
 While the Nikkei could open weaker, that is unlikely to
disturb the steady rise seen over the past seven weeks. It has
in fact outperformed the rest of Asia since China's rate

as foreign investors pumped money into emerging markets,
particularly in Asia.	
 The last Chinese rate increase in October came after

set the tone for the rest of the markets.

Europe's debt crisis and China must be on the alert for any
escalation of the problem, especially in January and February,
China's Commerce Minister Chen Deming was quoted as saying on
Friday.
 Chen said the 750-billion-euro ($983 billion) rescue fund set
up for crisis-hit EU nations and ongoing bond sales from these
countries did not solve the problem as the money would have to be
paid back at steep interest rates, the Shanghai Securities News
quoted him as saying.
 ""These measures just turn an acute disease into a chronic
one, and it's really hard to say whether these countries that are
in deep trouble over the debt crisis can recover in the coming
three or five years,"" Chen was quoted as saying.
 Chen's comments were the harshest of late from China, which
has been supportive of Europe's efforts so far to tackle its
problems, in part to protect its investment in the euro.
 But comments earlier this week from Chen at EU-China trade
talks urging Europe to take more urgent action to solve its
problems suggested that China's patience may be wearing thin.
 China has invested an undisclosed portion of its $2.65
trillion reserves in the euro.
 A Foreign Ministry official on Thursday reiterated China's
support for Europe, its biggest trading partner, by saying it
wanted to help the euro zone return to economic health.

ready to buy 4-5 billion euros of Portuguese government debt to
shield it from funding pressures. China's central bank declined

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices hit two-year
highs above $91 a barrel on Thursday, propelled by more
evidence the U.S. economy is strengthening, but world stock
prices were little changed with some indexes holding near
two-year peaks.
 The euro gyrated throughout the day, falling at one point
to three-week lows before recovering ground, only to come under
more selling pressure after Fitch Ratings cut Portugal's debt
one notch to A-plus from AA-minus, citing a difficult financing
environment and recession for the economy in 2011.
 Most financial markets meandered in thin trade ahead of the
Christmas and New Year holidays, though stocks held near their
best levels since before the collapse of investment bank Lehman
Brothers in September 2008. The three U.S. benchmark stock
indexes gained ground for a fourth consecutive -- albeit
holiday-shortened -- week.
 Japanese stocks, however, appeared poised to fall when
markets reopen for trade in Tokyo on Friday after a day off to
celebrate the Emperor's birthday. The March Nikkei futures
contract traded in Chicago fell 65 points to 10,320 <0#NK:>.
 U.S. economic data showed signs of further improvement,
with new claims for jobless benefits falling and consumer
spending increasing in November for a fifth straight month.
Orders for long-lasting manufactured goods excluding
transportation increased 2.4 percent, the largest increase
since March, after a 1.9 percent drop in October. For more,
see: [ID:nN23135079]
 The U.S. data contrasted with developments in Europe, where
China said it was willing to help countries in the euro zone
return to economic health and would support the International
Monetary Fund bailout package for the bloc. [ID:nBJI002501]
 Crude oil prices for February delivery on the New York
Mercantile Exchange rose $1.03 to settle at $91.51 a barrel.
Cold weather in the United States, plus shrinking U.S.
stockpiles and projections among OPEC members and analysts that
prices could reach $100 a barrel soon, supported the market
even with the greenback's strength.
 ""It's fair to say it (the price) is about right, but still
I think that it needs to improve a little bit more. About $100
would be a fair price for the time being,"" Libya's National Oil
Corp Chairman Shokri Ghanem told Reuters in Cairo ahead of a
meeting of Arab oil exporting countries.
 Spot gold prices  fell $4.66, or 0.34 percent, to
$1,379.89.
 STOCKS
 By the close of trade in New York, the Dow Jones industrial
average <.DJI> gained 14.00 points, or 0.12 percent, to
11,573.49. However, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> lost
2.07 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,256.77. The Nasdaq Composite
Index <.IXIC> dropped 5.88 points, or 0.22 percent, to
2,665.60.
 Banks dragged on the market, giving back recent gains after
a strong month. Bank of America Corp  lost 2.4 percent
to $13.06 and JPMorgan Chase & Co  fell 0.2 percent to
$42.08.
 Keith Springer, president of Springer Financial Advisors in
Sacramento, California, said the market is more likely to trade
sideways than fall dramatically.
 ""A sideways move can work off an overbought condition,""
said Springer. ""Just the fact that it slows down and moves
sideways is almost a corrective pattern for the stock market.""
 On Wednesday, the S&P 500 rose to its highest level since
the Lehman collapse, led by bank stocks.
 In Europe, shares were mixed as well. The FTSEurofirst 300
<.FTEU3> index of top European shares closed down 0.1 percent
at 1,146.49 points, having reached as high as 1,149.05 earlier.
London's FTSE 100 <.FTSE> topped the 6,000-mark on Thursday for
the first time since June 2008 before ending at 5,996.07, up
0.21 percent on the day.
 ""Expectations have improved a lot because we haven't had a
double dip (recession), earnings are strong and the consensus
for the economy next year will be strong,"" said Mark Bon, fund
manager at Canada Life in London.
 However, with the sovereign debt crisis in the background,
Bon said people were not ""all-out bullish,"" adding that the
other concern was whether China would be successful in cooling
its property market.
 The euro traded late in New York up just 0.14 percent at
$1.3117 , while the dollar fell 0.74 percent to 82.93
yen.
 Against a basket of currencies made up of its major trading
partners, the dollar fell 0.31 percent <.DXY>
 Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries fell 13/32 of a point in
price, pushing the yield up to 3.397 percent .

 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - China has refused repeated
U.S. requests to eliminate export restraints on rare earths
that have rattled its trading partners, the U.S. Trade
Representative's office said on Thursday.
 ""Going forward, the United States will continue to pursue
vigorous engagement with China on this issue and will not
hesitate to take further action, including WTO dispute
settlement, if appropriate,"" the trade representative's office
said in an annual report on how well China has complied with
commitments made when it joined the World Trade Organization in
2001.
 The warning came one day after the U.S. trade
representative's office said it had begun a legal challenge at
the WTO against certain Chinese subsidies for wind power
equipment manufacturers.
 U.S. officials said on Wednesday they could file additional
cases against questionable China policies in the clean energy
sector, and the new report amplifies U.S. concerns about
China's export restrictions on rare earths.
 It said the United States most recently pressed China to
eliminate its export restraints on rare earths during the
high-level U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade
meeting last week in Washington.
 ""But to date China has not been willing to change its
policies,"" the U.S. trade office said.
 China controls 97 percent of global supplies of the
elements and uses quotas and taxes to limit exports.
 China slashed the export quota by 40 percent this year and
plans to trim it further next year. It has already announced
increased export taxes on rare earths in 2011.
 The 17 rare earth elements are used in high-tech
electronics, magnets and batteries, with applications in hybrid
cars, renewable energy, computer monitors and weapons.
 China's export restrictions have caused ""world prices for
some of the rare earths to rise dramatically higher than
China's domestic prices,"" which has hindered efforts in other
countries to develop expertise in the manufacturing of clean
technology products, USTR said.
 ""In September 2010, China reportedly imposed a de facto ban
on all exports of rare earths to Japan, causing even more
concern among China's trading partners,"" USTR said.
 China says its curbs are for environmental reasons and to
manage supplies.
 The U.S. Trade Representative's annual report, which is
required under U.S. law and runs 124 pages, also said China
still has not fully implemented some important market-opening
commitments it made when it joined the WTO in 2001.
 ""Frequently, these problems can be traced to China's
pursuit of industrial policies that rely on excessive,
trade-distorting government intervention intended to promote or
protect China's domestic industries and state-owned
enterprises,"" the trade office said.
 China's ""serious problem"" with intellectual property rights
enforcement, its slow movement toward joining the WTO's
government procurement pact and its indigenous innovation
policies that discriminate against foreign companies are all
major concerns, the trade office said.
 However, the report also said progress had been made on
several issues during this month's U.S.-China talks.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - The euro rebounded from a
three-week low against the U.S. dollar on Thursday, but
analysts said persistent worries about Europe's debt crisis
would limit gains and could lead to a renewed decline in the
new year.
 The euro hit a session low of $1.3056, according to Reuters
data, its worst showing in three weeks. It was last up about
0.1 percent at $1.3110 , up about 0.2 percent.
 The dollar fell 0.6 percent to 82.99 yen  in thinned
trade, with Tokyo closed for a national holiday and ahead of
Christmas in the United States and Europe.
 With only a week of trading left in the year, the euro was
down more than 8.0 percent against the dollar in 2010.
 Anlaysts said the euro would hold above $1.30 for now, as
traders refrained from making big bets before year-end.
 ""We are looking for euro/dollar stability above $1.30
moving to the end of the year,"" said Sacha Tihanyi, currency
strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 ""With the late November and early December tests at that
level, and the subsequent failure of euro/dollar to sustainably
break below, I'd say that 1.30 looks like strong support.""
 But the outlook for the currency remains shaky, with fresh
losses seen in 2011.
 RATINGS
 More ratings downgrades for European countries, including
euro zone member Portugal, stoked fear that a debt crisis that
has already engulfed Ireland and Greece may spread further.
[ID:nWNA7882]]
 But the euro, which earlier fell below its 200-day moving
average for the fourth straight day, rebounded as investors
took profits and after Standard & Poor's reaffirmed its AAA
rating for France, the euro zone's second largest economy.
 The cost of insuring French debt against default rose
earlier this week amid speculation that it too could one day
face a ratings downgrade. [ID:nN23155845].
 SWISS FRANC RELENTS
 The Swiss franc weakened as investors booked profits on a
rally lifted it to record highs against the euro for six
straight days. The euro zone debt crisis has prompted investors
to flock to the safe-haven Swiss franc in recent weeks.
 The euro was up 0.9 percent at 1.2580 Swiss francs
 after hitting an all-time low of 1.2440 on Wednesday.
The dollar rose 0.8 percent to 0.9589 francs .
 After hitting record lows against the franc for several
consecutive days, the euro's rebound provided a chance for
traders to push it higher, especially with volume so low, said
BNY Mellon strategist Michael Woolfolk.
 But Elsa Lignos, currency strategist at RBC Capital
Markets, said as long as concerns about the euro zone debt
crisis persist, ""a lower euro/Swiss is very hard to fight.""
 The euro also got a boost after a Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman said China was willing to help countries in the
euro zone return to economic health. [ID:nBJI002501]
 The Jornal de Negocios reported this week that China may
buy 4 billion to 5 billion euros of Portuguese sovereign debt.
 But CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson warned that ""China
will have to buy a lot more than 5 billion euros if it expects
to have any impact on negative sentiment surrounding Europe.""

 NEW YORK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices hit two-year
highs above $91 a barrel propelled by more evidence on Thursday
the U.S. economy is strengthening, but world stock prices were
little changed with some indexes holding near two year peaks.
 The euro gyrated throughout the day, falling at one point
to three week lows before recovering ground, only to come under
more selling pressure after Fitch Ratings cut Portugal's debt
one notch to A-plus from AA-minus citing a difficult financing
environment and recession for the economy in 2011.
 Most financial markets were left to meander in thin trade
ahead of the Christmas and New Year holidays, though stocks
remained around their best levels since before the collapse of
investment bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008.
 U.S. economic data showed signs of further improvement with
new claims for jobless benefits falling, and consumer spending
increasing in November for a fifth straight month. Orders for
long-lasting manufactured goods excluding transportation
increased 2.4 percent, the largest increase since March, after
a 1.9 percent drop in October. [ID:nN23135079]
 The U.S. data contrasted with developments in Europe where
China said it was willing to help countries in the euro zone
return to economic health and would support the International
Monetary Fund bailout package for the bloc. [ID:nBJI002501]
 Crude oil prices for February delivery on the New York
Mercantile Exchange rose 89 cents, or 0.98 percent, to $91.37 a
barrel on Thursday. Cold weather in the United States plus
shrinking U.S. stockpiles and projections among OPEC members
and analysts that prices could reach $100 a barrel soon,
supported the market even with the greenback's strength.
 ""It's fair to say it (the price) is about right, but still
I think that it needs to improve a little bit more. About $100
would be a fair price for the time being,"" Libya's National Oil
Corp Chairman Shokri Ghanem told Reuters in Cairo ahead of a
meeting of Arab oil exporting countries.
 Spot gold prices  fell $4.60, or 0.33 percent, to
$1,380.
 STOCKS
 In midday New York trade, the major stock indexes were
mixed.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 8.74 points, or
0.08 percent, to 11,568.23. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> fell 1.96 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,256.88. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> lost 5.84 points, or 0.22

profit estimates and forecast a strong holiday season.
[ID:nN2287296]
 On Wednesday, the S&P 500 rose to its highest level since
the collapse of Lehman Brothers, led by bank stocks.
 In Europe, shares were mixed as well. The FTSEurofirst 300
<.FTEU3> index of top European shares closed down 0.1 percent
at 1,146.69 points, having reached as high as 1,149.05 earlier.
London's FTSE 100 <.FTSE> topped the 6,000-mark on Thursday for
the first time since June 2008 before ending at 5,996.07, up
0.21 percent on the day.
 ""Expectations have improved a lot because we haven't had a
double dip (recession), earnings are strong and the consensus
for the economy next year will be strong,"" said Mark Bon, fund
manager at Canada Life in London.
 However, with the sovereign debt crisis in the background
he didn't think people were ""all-out bullish,"" Bon said, adding
that the other concern was whether China would be successful in
cooling its property market.
 The euro traded up in midday New York action, gaining just
0.12 percent at $1.3115 , while the dollar fell 0.74

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - The euro rose from a
three-week low against the dollar on Thursday after failing to
break solidly through a key support level, though it remains
vulnerable amid persistent worries about indebted euro zone
countries.
 The euro bounced around its 200-day moving average of
$1.3093 on trading platform EBS. Investors have pushed the euro
beneath this key support level for four straight sessions, only
to see the currency bounce back later in the day.
 Analysts said the euro will likely hold above $1.30 in the
coming days, with traders reluctant to place big bets before
year-end. The outlook for the single currency remains shaky,
with fresh losses expected into 2011, they added.

for a weekly loss of about 0.5 percent.
 The euro was up 1.1 percent at 1.2597 Swiss francs

 NEW YORK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices rose to two
year highs on Thursday helped by further evidence of a
strengthening American economy, but world stock prices were

 NEW YORK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a three-week
low against the dollar on Thursday amid persistent concern
about debt troubles in Europe, though analysts said strong
technical support levels could limit near-term downside.
 The euro earlier fell to around $1.3050, below its 200-day
moving average currently located at $1.3092 on trading platform
EBS. Investors have pushed the euro beneath this key support
level for the past three sessions, only to see the currency

crisis has prompted investors to flock to the safe-haven Swiss

 U.S. economic data showing a small drop in weekly jobless
claims and a smaller-than-expected rise in consumer spending
had little impact on the dollar. With liquidity thinning ahead
of year-end, traders said flows were having a bigger impact on
price than fundamentals.

 By Daisy Ku and Michelle Chen
 HONG KONG, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's central bank said
on Thursday it has fine-tuned its yuan trade settlement scheme to
ensure stable development of the fast-growing key offshore market for the Chinese currency.
 Norman Chan, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA), forecast demand for yuan trade settlement in Hong Kong would reach around 4 billion yuan ($600 million) in the first quarter of 2011.
 The HKMA will set up a standby credit facility of 20 billion
yuan through its currency swap line with China's central bank to
cover any excess demand, he told reporters.
 ""Next year will be a crucial year for developing the
renminbi offshore market in Hong Kong because the mainland
authorities have just announced a major expansion of the list of
pilot enterprises that can qualify to participate in renminbi
trade settlements,"" Chan said.
 Earlier this month, Beijing announced the expansion of its
cross-border yuan trade settlement pilot programme to 67,359
exporters from an original 365 companies.
 Beijing has been positioning Hong Kong as an emerging
offshore centre for trading the Chinese currency. Demand for
yuan , also known as the renminbi, in Hong Kong has
been rising rapidly since July this year when banks in the
territory were first freed to transfer the currency among
themselves.
 By late October, Bank of China (Hong Kong), the clearing
bank for yuan trade in Hong Kong, said it had already used up
its 8-billion-yuan full-year quota, prompting the HKMA to
activate its 200-billion-yuan currency swap line to clear
currency transactions tied to exports and imports.
 The clearing bank reaching its quota triggered speculation
that some settlements were not trade-related, showing strong
demand among foreign investors to get hold of the yuan in the
Hong Kong market.
 The HKMA also said it would help ensure stability for the offshore renminbi market by putting a time limit on currency transactions.
 ""Participating banks can only purchase renminbi through the
Shanghai conversion window for their customers to trade
transactions due for payments within three months,"" Chan said.
 ""We hope with all these measures, we would be able to
develop renminbi business in Hong Kong and raise it to a new
platform,"" he said.
 Since rules to promote cross-border trade settlement were
relaxed in the second half of 2010, the offshore yuan business
has exploded in Hong Kong, with so-called 'dim sum' bonds
meeting feverish demand and the yuan deposit base rising
sharply.
 Yuan deposits in Hong Kong jumped to 280 billion yuan by the end of November from 217 billion yuan at the end of October, Chan said.
 HKMA banks has also obtained a licence to invest in China's
interbank bond market, Chan said, paving the way for Hong Kong
to allocate part of its $266 billion foreign currency reserves
in yuan-denominated bonds.

 * Oil near two-year high; euro stabilises after China
 
 By Natsuko Waki
 PARIS, Dec 23 (Reuters) - World stocks hit their highest
level since September 2008 on Thursday while oil held near a
two-year peak as favourable U.S. data reinforced expectations
economic growth will retain momentum into next year.
 Wednesday's upwardly revised data showing the U.S economy
expanded at 2.6 percent in the third quarter, coupled with
recent retail sales figures, pointed to firmer economic activity
in the world's largest economy.
 Stronger banking stocks helped the S&P 500 index <.SPX> hit
its highest level since the collapse of Lehman Brothers on
Wednesday, underpinning sentiment in Asia and Europe.
 ""The corporate picture still looks very bright, the trend
towards higher profits is going to continue and public policies
should remain shareholder-friendly,"" said Henk Potts, equity
strategist at Barclays Wealth.
 ""In terms of the macro environment, we would expect most of
the economies to keep growing and that is a pretty powerful
mix.""
The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> was up 0.1
percent, having earlier hit 328.89, its highest since early
September 2008. 
 The index has gained nearly 10 percent this year. 
 The Thomson Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> rose
0.1 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> was up slightly on the
day, having hit a 27-month peak earlier, while emerging stocks
<.MSCIEF> were steady. Tokyo was shut for a holiday. 
 U.S. stock futures  were unchanged on the day,
indicating a steady start on Wall Street later.
 U.S. crude oil  stood at $90.44 a barrel, within half
a cent of the Wednesday peak that was the highest since October
2008.
 Abnormally cold weather in the United States and Europe has
spurred the rally above $90, the latest leg in a more than 40
percent rise from a year low in May.
 Bund futures  were steady on the day.
 The dollar <.DXY> fell 0.2 percent against a basket of major
currencies while the yen rose 0.7 percent to 82.96 per dollar
 in a flow-driven, thin-liquidity trading.
 However, a recent run of positive U.S. data and persistent
concerns about the euro zone debt crisis are raising
expectations that the dollar would trade on a firmer tone into
the new year.
 ""Broad-based dollar appreciation in 2011 is possible,
reflecting our optimism that the U.S. economy could be entering
a period of economic growth that surprises the financial
markets"", Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ said in a note to
clients.
 ""Our profile for dollar strength for 2011 will show the
larger part of appreciation taking place in H1 2011.""
 The euro steadied at $1.3100 , drawing support from
comments out of China.
 Beijing is willing to help countries in the euro zone return
to economic health and will support the International Monetary
Fund bailout package for the bloc, a Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman said on Thursday. [ID:nBJI002501]
 The Jornal de Negocios daily reported that China was looking
to buy between 4 and 5 billion euros of Portuguese sovereign
debt to help the country ward off pressure in bond markets. 
 Financial markets showed no reaction to comments by North
Korea's minister of armed forces who said its military was
prepared to wage a ""holy war"" against the South using its
nuclear deterrent after what he called Seoul's attempt to
initiate conflict.

 BEIJING, Dec 23 (Reuters) - China is willing to help
countries in the euro zone return to economic health and will
support the International Monetary Fund element of a bailout
package for the bloc, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
said on Thursday.
 Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu also told a regular
news conference in Beijing that the euro zone was one of the
most important areas for China's foreign exchange investments,
following reports that Beijing could step in to shore up
European finances.
 The euro steadied against the dollar and the Swiss franc,
helped by the comments, although analysts said the outlook for
the single currency was shaky, with fresh losses expected into
2011.
 The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that China had
offered to take more ""concerted action"" to support European
financial stabilisation. It cited unnamed senior European
officials after talks with Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan.
 Separately, a Portuguese newspaper reported that China was
ready to buy 4-5 billion euros of Portuguese sovereign debt to
help the country ward off market pressure which has intensified
as investors grew concerned it would be next in line to seek a
bailout after Ireland and Greece.
 Portuguese officials have said the government is trying to
diversify its debt investor base, with China as a priority. 
 Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos met Chinese
Finance Minister Xie Xuren and the head of the People's Bank of
China during a visit to the country last week.
 But it is unclear whether Beijing would be prepared to take
on so much fresh exposure to Portugal, given that Beijing has
faced domestic political pressure to invest the country's
foreign reserves more carefully. 
 Chinese investment funds suffered some large, high-profile
losses during the global financial crisis. 
 In October, during a visit to Greece, Chinese Premier Wen
Jiabao offered to buy Greek bonds when Athens resumed issuing.
 A month later, President Hu Jintao visited Portugal and
offered ""concrete measures"" to help the weak economy but stopped
short of promising to buy Portuguese bonds.

 LONDON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - The euro steadied against the
dollar and the Swiss franc on Thursday, helped by supportive
comments from China, but analysts said the outlook for the
single currency was shaky, with fresh losses expected into 2011.
 Liquidity was at a premium in currency markets ahead of
year-end, with traders saying flows were having a bigger impact
on price than fundamentals.
 A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said China was
willing to help countries in the euro zone return to economic
health and would support the International Monetary Fund bailout
package for the bloc. [ID:nBJI002501]
 A Portuguese newspaper report on Wednesday suggested China
was ready to buy significant amounts of Portuguese debt to try
to instil confidence in the country's ailing economy.
 But the single currency's outlook remained shaky at best and
more losses into 2011 are seen likely as the euro zone debt
crisis looks set to drag on.
 ""We expect further weakness for the euro by the end of the
first quarter of 2011, and in the near term a break of the
200-day moving average will be important,"" said Elsa Lignos,
currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 The euro was flat against the dollar  at $1.3100,
close to the 200-day moving average at $1.3091. In the past
week, the euro has fallen about 1 percent against the greenback.
 The euro was flat at 1.2466 Swiss francs , hovering
near an all-time low of around 1.2448 hit on Wednesday.
 ""As long as there are periphery concerns in the euro zone, a
lower euro/Swiss is very hard to fight,"" Lignos said.
 Investors have been flocking to the safe-haven status of the
Swiss franc and shifting out of euros on worries that the euro
zone debt crisis will rumble on.
 ""Our next target for EURCHF is 1.2400,"" BNP Paribas
strategists said in a client note. ""The CHF is currently driven
by capital rather than trade flows and thus remains well
supported against the EUR as deposit inflows continue.""
 
 AUSSIE DOLLAR FIRM
 The Australian dollar was back at parity against the
greenback thanks to optimism about the global economy, which has
supported commodity prices <.CRB> and global stocks
<.MIWD00000PUS>.
 The diverging moves showed investors favoured safe havens
like the Swiss franc within Europe, but that they were also keen
on currencies deemed riskier like the Aussie given the generally
more upbeat outlook, particularly for emerging economies. 
 Trading, however, was thin with Tokyo shut for a public
holiday and as the year-end holidays loomed.

1363,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2010 03:52AM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-White House summit for China's Hu set for Jan. 19," * Firm date finally set	
 * North Korea and economic issues likely to feature
(Adds Chinese government comment, paragraphs 5-7)	
 By Chris Buckley and Caren Bohan	
 BEIJING/WASHINGTON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - President Barack
Obama will host his Chinese counterpart, Hu Jintao, on a state
visit on Jan. 19, the United States said, setting the stage
for a summit in which North Korea and currency strains are
likely to loom large.	
 The White House said the visit would highlight the
importance of expanding cooperation ""on bilateral, regional
and global issues"".	
 While Beijing and Washington are likely to use the summit
to cast their relationship in a friendly light, Obama and Hu
will have disagreements to discuss, especially North Korea and
China's trade surplus and currency controls.	
 North Korea, angry at live-fire artillery drills into what
it says was its territorial waters last month, shelled a South
Korean island, killing four people. It is also accused of
sinking a South Korean submarine in March, killing 46 sailors.	
 North Korea has also triggered regional alarm by claiming
fast progress in uranium enrichment, which would give it a
second pathway to making nuclear weapons.	
 China has resisted calls from Washington and its regional
allies, South Korea and Japan, to criticise and increase
pressure on Pyongyang, which relies on Beijing for economic
and diplomatic backing. Beijing has instead urged all sides to
return to talks.	
 U.S. complaints that China keeps its yuan currency too
cheap, giving it an unfair trade advantage, are also likely to
feature.	
 The U.S. trade deficit with China rose 20 percent in the
first 10 months of 2010 and could top $270 billion for the
year when final figures are in. That would pass the record of
$268 billion set in 2008.	
 But carefully negotiated summits such as this are more
about nurturing understanding than scoring policy
breakthroughs, said David Lampton, professor of China studies
at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies
in Washington.	
 ""Lately, one of the biggest problems in U.S.-China
relations is that each side has had excessive expectations of
what the other could conceivably deliver,"" Lampton wrote in an
earlier email response to questions about Hu's trip.	
 ""If this trip can lead the two leaders to have more
realistic appreciations of the limits each country faces in
dealing with the other, that alone should be counted a
successful trip.""	
 China will want the United States to avoid the gaffes that
marred his trip to the White House in 2006, when China's
national anthem was announced as that of the ""Republic of
China"", Taiwan, the self-ruled island Beijing considers a
breakaway province.	
 Hu also stood flustered on the White House lawn while a
follower of Falun Gong, a spiritual sect banned in China,
harangued him for three minutes from the press area.	
 China called that visit a ""state visit"", but the U.S.
deemed it an official visit, a less prestigious tag. The last
visit to the White House by a Chinese leader that both sides
called a state one was by Jiang Zemin in 1997.	
 Hu's visit will include a state dinner in the evening.
That will be a symbolic trophy for the Chinese leader, who
analysts have said will use the trip to boost his status as he
prepares to leave office from late 2012. [ID:nTOE6B0024]	
 The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Hu was going to
Washington in January, but would not confirm the date given by
the White House.

 By Chris Buckley
 BEIJING, Dec 23 (Reuters) - China is willing to help
countries in the eurozone return to economic health, a Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said on Thursday, following a report
that Beijing could step in to shore up finances in the
beleaguered bloc.
 Many investors are looking to China, as the owner of the
world's largest foreign reserves, to use a portion of its $2.65
trillion holdings to come to the eurozone's rescue by buying up
Greek, Irish, Portuguese and Spanish sovereign bonds.
 ""As for what countries' state bonds China purchases, that's
not in our purview,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu told a
regular news conference in Beijing. ""But I can tell you China
supports the financial stabilisation package of the European
Union and International Monetary Fund to respond to the European
debt crisis.""
 ""We're willing to support eurozone countries in surmounting
the crisis and achieving economic recovery and fiscal health.""
 China offered to take more ""concerted action"" to support
European financial stabilisation, the Financial Times said on
Wednesday, citing unnamed senior European officials after talks
with Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan.
 Wang said on Tuesday that Beijing supported efforts by the EU
and the International Monetary Fund to calm global markets in the
wake of Europe's debt crisis and said China had taken ""concrete
actions"" to help some European countries. [ID:nTOE6BK01Q].
 Concern that Europe's debt problems could engulf bigger
economies in the region have weighed on global financial markets
this year and taken a toll on the euro .
 ""The European market, it can be said, has been in the past,
is now, and in the future will be one of the most important
investment markets for China's foreign exchange holdings,"" Jiang
said.
 In part to protect its euro investments, China has repeatedly
expressed support for the common currency this year and vowed to
buy bonds from Greece, whose fiscal meltdown in May set off the
latest debt rout.
 A Portuguese newspaper reported on Wednesday that China was
ready to buy 4-5 billion euros of Portuguese sovereign debt to
help the country ward off pressure in debt markets.

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, Dec 23 (Reuters) - The euro won some reprieve in
Asia on Thursday, having touched a record low versus the Swiss
franc overnight, with traders citing buying interest emerging
from players in the region including central banks.	
 But the single currency's outlook remained shaky at best
and more losses into 2011 are seen likely as the euro zone
debt crisis looked set to drag on.	
 In contrast, the Australian dollar was back at parity
against the greenback thanks to optimism about the global
economy, which has supported commodity prices and
global stocks .	
 The diverging moves showed investors favoured safe-havens
like the Swiss franc within Europe, but were also keen on
currencies deemed riskier like the Aussie given the generally
more upbeat outlook particularly for emerging economies. 
 Trading, however, was thin in Asia with Tokyo shut for a
public holiday and as the year-end holidays loomed. Many of
the major currency pairs traded in slim, 20-40 point ranges.	


 ""People have packed up shop really and so we're seeing
quite whippy ranges,"" a dealer at an Australian bank said.	
 The euro was last at $1.3112 , having traded in a
tight range between $1.3097 and $1.3120. Bids were seen lined
up around $1.3070, and offers around $1.3130/50.	
 In the past week, the single currency has fallen about 1
percent against the greenback.	
 Versus the Swiss franc, the single currency bought 1.2457
, having plumbed an all-time low around 1.2448
overnight after options barrier at 1.2500 were taken out,
traders said.	
 ""Our next target for EURCHF is 1.2400,"" said BNP Paribas
strategists in a client note. ""The CHF is currently driven by
capital rather than trade flows and thus remains well
supported against the EUR as deposit inflows continue.""	
 The dollar index , which tracks the greenback's
performance against a basket of major currencies, fell about
0.2 percent to 80.516.	
 Against the yen, the dollar slid to one-week lows around
83.12 , with traders citing stops being triggered below
83.40. The decline was exaggerated in very thin conditions,
they said. 
 Despite the fall, the pair is near the middle of a wider
range roughly between 82.30 and 84.50 seen since late November.	
 Meanwhile, the kiwi last stood at $0.7438, having
recovered from a brief fall below $0.7400 in immediate
reaction to data showing a contraction in the New Zealand
economy for the first time in six quarters. [ID:nL3E6NM1JJ]	
 ""The market was braced for a much worse than expected
number,"" said Sue Trinh, currency strategist at RBC Capital
Markets in Hong Kong.	
 ""Markets have gotten very bearish on the kiwi over the
past couple of weeks especially after the warning from S&P
rating agency.""	
 The recovery in the kiwi knocked the Aussie off a 10-year
high of NZ$1.3505 set just after the NZ GDP data.
The pair last traded at NZ$1.3453. 
 Against the greenback, the Aussie was at one-week highs
around $1.0017 .

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Asian shares edged higher on
Thursday with gains led by resource-linked stocks, and oil
traded just below the two-year high it hit yesterday on
cautious but growing optimism of the health of the world
economy.	
 European stocks are also expected to start extend their
December rally, led by heavyweight energy issues.
[ID:nLDE6BM03V]	
 Wednesday's revised data which showed the U.S economy
expanded at a slightly higher pace of 2.6 percent in the third
quarter came after recent data such as retail sales indicated
economic activity has accelerated in the last few months.	
 The Asia-ex Japan index for commodity shares as measured
by MSCI climbed within sight of a recent 2-1/2
year peak as investors bet that a healing U.S. economy along
with the ongoing rise of China and India would continue to
fuel demand for commodities amid tight supplies.
[ID:nN22291718].	
 The S&P/Goldman commodities index , which has a
higher weighting of oil and is therefore more relevant to Asia
due to its huge demand, also approached a fresh 26-month peak.	
 U.S. crude oil for delivery in February  traded at
$90.68 per barrel at 0647 GMT, 12 cents below Wednesday's peak.	
 The 30-day correlation between the S&P 500 and the same
commodities index has been between a high 0.87 and 0.94,
indicating that investors view both asset classes with a
similar degree of bullishness.	


 That brightening growth view has encouraged analysts to
revise upwards their projections for the U.S. and pushed
Treasury yields up nearly 100 basis points since the start of
November,when the Fed launched its second round of
quantitative easing.	
 ""The global economy looks a whole lot happier than it did
six months ago. Fears of a double-dip have faded,"" HSBC
economists said in a note while upgrading their 2011 global
growth forecasts by nearly half a percentage point to 3.3
percent led by Asia.	
 That growing optimism was reflected in latest Reuters
polls which showed investment houses raising their equity
holdings, increasing exposure to high-yield credit and cutting
back on government debt. 
 
 FAIRLY PRICED	
 Asia Pacific stocks as measured by MSCI
were slightly higher. Thin year-end liquidity and a holiday in
Japan meant activity was limited after investors recently
banked some profits when Asian stocks hit 2-1/2 year peaks.	
 According to Thomson Reuters IBES data, 12-month forward
price/earnings multiples for Asia-ex Japan shares was hovering
close to its 10-year average of 12.83 -- indicating that
stocks are fairly priced at current levels.	
 But in a grim reminder that the euro zone's debt crisis is
far from over, the euro plumbed to a record low versus
the Swiss franc overnight, with traders citing some buying
interest emerging from players in the region including central
banks.	
 While the 2011 outlook for the euro continues to be
bearish, it seems sandwiched between good sovereign demand in
the high 1.30's and decent selling interest on 100 pip rallies.	
 Ten-year U.S. Treasuries were largely
unchanged at 3.35 percent with benchmark yields holding below
a seven-month high tested last week. Ten-year Treasury futures
expiring in March 2011  were largely unchanged. 
 The benchmark iTraxx investment grade index
was quoted at 102/105 bps, compared with Wednesday's close of
104 bps. It ended 2009 at a spread of 95.50 bps.	
 Gold , a big beneficiary this year as a result of
its perceived status as a safe haven asset amid Europe's debt
crisis, was largely steady around $1,386 an ounce, just below
a historical peak of around $1,430 hit earlier this month.

said on Thursday.
 ""I am sure that the euro will survive ... that is in the
interest of the European Union and all euro zone members,""
Kranjec, who is also the governor of the Slovenian central
bank, said in a midnight debate on TV Slovenia.
 ""I see no danger for existence of the euro although there
are problems there, but they are being solved,"" he said.
 ""The most difficult questions have been solved amid the
case of Ireland and here the European Union showed a lot of
flexibility,"" he added, saying he expected the EU to reach an
agreement on fiscal harmonisation, as well.
 Slovenia's minister of development and European affairs,
Mitja Gaspari, in the same debate sounded a much less
optimistic note and indicated an unwillingness by Slovenia to
help on any future bailouts of indebted euro zone members.
 ""Europe is entering the coming year amid extremely
uncertain conditions. ... After what has been happening in the
second half of this year we see there is no answer to the
financial crisis in Europe,"" said Gaspari.
 ""There are attempts to solve the problems case by case and
we still do not know whether those attempts work,"" said
Gaspari, who was a member of the European Central Bank
governing council in 2007.
 He also said the patience of euro zone members which have
to finance fellow euro members is running out after the euro
zone ensured additional financing to indebted Greece and
Ireland over the past months.
 ""I have to say directly that in Slovenia we will probably
find it difficult to sustain saving another country in the euro
zone that may come with a demand for additional financing,""
Gaspari said.
 Slovenia was badly hit by the global crisis due to its
dependency on exports and its budget deficit soared to 5.8
percent in 2009 from 1.8 percent a year before amid lower tax
income and high government spending on measures to ease the
impact of the global crisis on the economy.
 Slovenia, which adopted the euro in 2007, expects growth of
about 1 percent this year after its economy shrank by 8.1
percent in 2009.
 Standard & Poor's on Wednesday revised its outlook on
Slovenia's sovereign foreign currency credit to negative from
stable, citing concerns that Slovenia lacks structural measures
aimed at reducing the government deficit.

1383,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2010 06:52PM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-US Congress renews very few trade benefits," (Updates throughout)
 WASHINGTON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress on
Wednesday approved a six-week renewal of duty-free treatment
for goods from Colombia and Ecuador, but will allow similar
benefits for about 130 other countries to expire.
 The extension provides just enough time for flower
exporters in Colombia to fill U.S. orders for the Feb. 14
Valentine's Day holiday without being hit by tariffs.
 But ""the exclusion of the Generalized System of Preferences
(GSP) from the package means that this important program will
lapse on December 31, hurting American consumers and businesses
as well as workers and farmers in many of the world's poorer
countries,"" U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said.
 The fate of the Andean Trade Preferences Act and the much
larger GSP program has been up in the air for weeks.
 GSP provides duty-free treatment for about 4,800 goods
produced in developing countries to help them create jobs.
 Its pending expiration means the United States will at
least temporarily begin collecting duties on those imports
starting Jan. 1.
 Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions had blocked Senate action on
a bill renewing both programs for 18 months because of a duty
waiver Bangladesh receives for sleeping bags.
 The Republican said the GSP waiver threatens to shut down a
sleeping bag factory in his state.
 He has pushed for a 9 percent duty on imports from
Bangladesh, the same as China is required to pay.
 Senators, just before adjourning for the year, worked out a
compromise bill to extend the Andean trade benefits for six
weeks. The House of Representatives then quickly approved the
measure as one of its final acts of 2010.
 The short-term fix also renews Trade Adjustment Assistance
for six weeks. That program provides funding to retrain workers
who have lost their job because of trade competition.
 Colombia, recently hit by massive flooding that has
affected about 2 million people, lobbied hard for an extension
of the Andean Trade Preferences Act.
 ""We hope that the administration and Congress continue to
open the door toward a stronger, more dynamic trade
relationship, through the approval of a longer extension for
ATPA, and the subsequent approval of the FTA (free trade
agreement) between both countries,"" Colombian Ambassador
Gabriel Silva said in a statement.
 Supporters promised to work in early 2011 for renewal of
the GSP program and a longer extension of the Andean trade
benefits and U.S. worker retraining program.

 By Alina Selyukh
 NEW YORK, Dec 22 (Reuters) - World stocks climbed on
Wednesday to two-year highs on growing optimism about U.S.
economic growth while the euro slumped to lifetime lows versus
the Swiss franc after a new round of credit rating warnings
reminded traders euro-zone debt problems can still flare.
 Oil prices topped $90 a barrel, hitting a 26-month peak as
the latest U.S. data showed a third straight weekly drop in
U.S. crude inventories and a cold snap on both sides of the
Atlantic prompted pre-holiday buying. For details, see
[ID:nLDE6BL12M]
 The euro drifted to its weakest level since its 1999 launch
against the Swiss franc, deemed a safe-haven currency. The euro
fell below 1.25 Swiss francs in a sixth consecutive day of
losses after Moody's warned it may cut Portugal's credit rating
and Fitch said it may downgrade Greece, the latest in the wave
of downgrade warnings on euro-zone nations. [ID:nLDE6BK0HE]
 But U.S. investor sentiment was as bullish as ever, with
stocks on a tear as money managers reallocated capital in
anticipation of improving economic data and robust corporate
earnings, according to a Reuters poll. [ID:nLDE6BL0B2]
 U.S. stocks rode the advances in the financial sector into
a fifth-straight session of gains, rising to levels not seen
since before Lehman Brothers went bankrupt on-Sept. 15, 2008.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 26.33
points, or 0.23 percent, to close at 11,559.49, after reaching
an intraday high at 11,566.99. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> rose 4.24 points, or 0.34 percent, to 1,258.84, after
climbing as high intraday as 1,259.39. The Nasdaq Composite
Index <.IXIC> edged up 3.87 points, or 0.15 percent, to close
at 2,671.48, after earlier hitting an intraday peak at
2,675.26.
 After lagging during most of the year, financial stocks
have been feeding the U.S. stock market's rally. Bank of
America Corp  rose 3.1 percent to $13.38 and JPMorgan
Chase & Co  climbed 2.8 percent to $42.16, giving the
greatest boost to the Dow industrials.
 In line with the U.S. rally, Europe's FTSEurofirst 300
index <.FTEU3> tacked on 0.2 percent to close at 1,147.61,
hitting a fresh 27-month high.
 Global stocks measured by the MSCI all-country world index
<.MIWD00000PUS> edged up 0.2 percent, just a few points short
of a 26-month high hit last month.
 Looking ahead, Japan's stock market will be closed on
Thursday for the Emperor's Birthday, a holiday.
 U.S. DEBT PRICES FALL
 Traders shrugged off the latest data showing U.S. consumer
spending was softer than previously estimated and third-quarter
U.S. economic growth was also below forecasts but higher than
earlier estimates. [ID:nN22291718]
 ""The more recent data suggests we're seeing reasonably
healthy retail sales growth, pretty healthy investment
spending, and some growth in employment. So maybe the core
growth or final sales growth is starting to accelerate in the
fourth quarter,"" said Zach Pandl, an economist at Nomura
Securities International in New York.
 U.S. Treasury prices slipped in thin trading after the
Federal Reserve completed its last purchases until next week.
With traders concerned about next week's supply, the benchmark
10-year U.S. Treasury note  dropped 11/32 in price,
yielding 3.35 percent.
 CLARITY SOUGHT IN EUROPE
 The ratings warnings on smaller debt-laden euro-zone
countries sent the single currency stumbling against the Swiss
currency, but the euro eked out some gains against the
generally flat dollar.
 The euro  nudged 0.01 percent higher to $1.3096 from
a previous session close of $1.3095. The dollar dipped 0.10
percent against a basket of major currencies <.DXY> to 80.64.
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar slipped 0.19 percent to
83.57 yen .
 Some of the euro's respite came from a Portuguese
newspaper report that China was ready to buy 4 billion to 5
billion euros worth of Portuguese sovereign debt.
[ID:nLDE6BL0MW] Beijing offered no comment on the report,
leaving investors in the bond market unconvinced and sovereign
bonds of smaller European countries under pressure.
 ""There's been no clarity on what European Union leaders
will do to deal with the debt crisis,"" said Investec economist
Philip Shaw. ""That uncertainty, coupled with the threat of
downgrades to various peripheral countries, has led to more
spread widening and a weaker euro.""
 The credit rating warnings and the weakening dollar
supported the safe-haven demand for gold. The euro's troubles
and growing appetite for risk, however, muted gold's earlier
advance, as its spot price  dipped 0.1 percent to
$1,383.19 an ounce in late trading on thin year-end volume.
 U.S. oil futures  for February delivery rose 66
cents, to settle at $90.48 per barrel, the highest settlement
since Oct. 3, 2008. The rally was driven by unusually cold
weather in parts of the northern hemisphere and a large
decline in weekly crude stocks, surpassing expectations.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The euro slid to its lowest
level against the Swiss franc for a sixth straight day on
Wednesday, with losses expected to steepen in 2011 as the euro
zone debt crisis weighs.
 The euro fell below 1.25 Swiss francs, down about 16
percent so far this year, as debt troubles in Portugal, Spain
and Greece and fears of contagion enhanced the safe-haven
status of the Swiss currency.
 Uncertainty surrounding these countries has hurt the euro
as investors seek safety. At the session low, the euro was
below its 200-day moving average, reaching $1.3095, a bearish
sign.
 ""If you look at what is going on with the euro it shows
there is negative sentiment due to the lack of resolve in the
euro zone,"" said Jessica Hoversen, currency strategist at MF
Global in Chicago. ""I do not see the major downturn trend of
the euro being threatened before end of year.""
 In late New York trading, the euro was down 0.7 percent at
1.2469 Swiss francs. It hit as low as 1.2448 on trading
platform EBS after taking out option barriers at 1.2500,
traders said.
 However, the euro gained against the dollar, rising 0.05
percent to $1.3100, which was below the session's high of
$1.3181 but bouncing off its near three-week trough of $1.3073
set on Tuesday.
 Hoversen said the euro versus the Swiss franc will likely
test the 1.20 level, but she sees that level as a bottom and it
should climb above it next year.
 The options market signaled further downside for the pair
and speculative positioning data showed an increase in bets in
favor of the Swiss franc. Morgan Stanley said this week it
expects the euro to fall to 1.20 Swiss francs in 2011.
 ""We view the surging Swiss franc heading into year end as
an ominous warning sign for further trouble ahead in the euro
zone in early 2011,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at
the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London.
 ""It appears that smart money investors are preemptively
bailing funds out of the euro zone with Switzerland providing a
safe port to ride out the euro zone sovereign debt storm that
appears to loom on the horizon,"" Hardman said.
 The Jornal de Negocios daily newspaper reported China is
looking to buy between 4 billion euros ($5.26 billion) and 5
billion euros of Portuguese sovereign debt to help the country
ward off pressure in debt markets, though it gave no details of
its sources. China's central bank declined to comment on the
report.
 EURO DOWNSIDE
 Euro/Swiss franc risk reversals moved further in favor of
euro downside this week as the spot rate repeatedly hit
all-time lows.
 One-month 25-delta euro/Swiss risk reversals last traded at
around 2.10, with a bias toward puts, suggesting more investors
are betting the euro will fall against the Swiss franc than
rise. In mid-December, one-month risk reversals were around
$1.90.
 The latest IMM data from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed speculators boosted long positions in the
Swiss franc in the week ending Dec. 14. The number likely
increased further this week given the rally in the franc.
 Goldman Sachs said its implied IMM EUR/CHF positioning
score stands at -4.5, the same level as in August and
consistent with a relatively stretched short positioning that
has been exceeded only rarely in the past.
 Against the yen, the euro fell 0.3 percent to 109.42.
 The dollar lost 0.3 percent to 83.54 yen after data showed
U.S. economic growth was a touch higher than previously
estimated in the third quarter, but below expectations.
 In the near term, dealers expect range-bound trade, with
one-month implied volatility on dollar/yen falling below 9.5
percent, the lowest since late 2007.
 Looking ahead, U.S. economic data will be at the forefront
on Thursday, with the Labor Department's weekly jobless claims
report and the Commerce Department's November new home sales
data slated to in the morning.
 If the data comes in better than expected, it would bode
well for the dollar but weigh on the euro.
 ""Growth in the U.S. should keep the dollar firm for the
time being, with the euro at risk of hitting $1.20 to $1.25 in
the second half of next year before reaching a bottom,""
Hoversen said.

 * Agreement seeks to end patchwork of terms and conditions

(Rewrites with release of OECD statement)
 PARIS, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Major aircraft producing nations
have agreed a deal to bring state financial support for
exporting commercial aircraft more in line with market rates,
the OECD said on Wednesday.
 The agreement between Brazil, Canada, Japan, the United
States and the European Union -- including Britain, France,
Germany and Italy -- still has to be formally approved by all
parties before Jan. 20 so it can enter into force by Feb. 1.
 The deal aims to make the terms of state financing of
aircraft exports better reflect what buyers would get on the
market, especially in the case of airlines that have easy access
to funds on the markets.
 ""The objective of the agreement is to create and maintain a
market- and risk-based fee system that produces a level playing
field between manufacturers, airlines and governments,"" the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said.
 The Paris-based organisation, which hosted the talks that
led to the accord, said it would help unify a patchwork of
different financing terms and conditions.
Airlines have long been lobbying for a change to rules which
allow the host governments of U.S. manufacturer Boeing and
Europe's Airbus-- France, Germany, Spain and Britain -- to give
export financing to some, but not all carriers.
 The agreement includes a transition period so that existing
orders are covered by current terms and conditions.
 Airlines in countries where Airbus and Boeing planes are
made say they are unfairly locked out of a system of export aid
which reduces costs for major carriers in the Gulf, like
Emirates, and Asia which have grabbed market share from older
rivals. 
 The role of export credit financing has increased sharply as
private sources of funds dried up during the financial crisis.
 The entry of smaller competitors such as Canada's Bombardier
and Brazil's Embraer into the market for larger planes,
challenging Airbus and Boeing's duopoly, has also brought the
issue to a head.
 Welcoming the deal, French Economy Minister Christine
Lagarde, Foreign Trade Minister Pierre Lellouche and Transport
Minister Thierry Mariani said in a statement: ""The new agreement
allows financial support conditions for all civil aircraft to be
unified.""
""This new regulatory framework takes into account the
interests of the European manufacturer Airbus, which will
continue to benefit from the state guarantee in some of its
exports,"" they said.
 Airbus ""will be subject, as far as financing was concerned,
to the same rules of the game as its competitor Boeing,"" they
said, adding that the deal would also be fairer for French,
German and British airlines.

 * Union sees long-term effort to change China policy
(Adds detail, lawmaker reaction)
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The United States on
Wednesday accused China of illegally subsidizing the production
of wind power equipment and asked for talks at the World Trade
Organization, the first step in filing a trade case.
 U.S. trade officials said they were concerned Chinese
manufacturers of wind turbines and related parts and components
could have received several hundred million dollars in
questionable government grants in 2008 under China's Special
Fund for Wind Power Manufacturing.
 They said the grants appeared to violate WTO rules by
requiring Chinese manufacturers to use only Chinese-made parts
and components.
 ""Import substitution subsidies are particularly harmful and
inherently trade distorting, which is why they are expressly
prohibited under WTO rules,"" U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk
said in a statement. ""These subsidies effectively operate as a
barrier to U.S. exports to China.
 U.S. wind turbine manufacturers such as General Electric
and United Technologies are eager to compete in China's
fast-growing market, although the United Steelworkers union was
the driving force behind the case.
 The decision comes about a month before Chinese President
Hu Jintao goes to Washington for talks with President Barack
Obama that are expected to touch on how the two countries can
cooperate to create clean energy jobs.
 Some U.S. lawmakers worry China is not prepared to play
fair in the sector.
 ""The United States cannot replace its dependence on foreign
oil with a dependence on clean energy technology made in
China,"" said Senator Sherrod Brown. ""American manufacturing
must lead the way and to do this, they need a level playing
field.""
 By asking for WTO talks, the United States begins a 60-day
period for the two countries to resolve the disagreement
through consultation. If those efforts fail, the United States
could ask for a WTO dispute settlement panel to hear its
complaint.
 The steelworkers union filed a petition in September,
accusing Beijing of a long list of subsidies and other policies
to favor production of clean energy technologies in China at
the expense of the United States and other countries.
 Kirk said his office would continue to investigate many of
the allegations raised in the steelworkers' petition, and could
bring additional cases at the WTO.
 One high-profile issue still being examined by the U.S.
trade representative's office is a complaint about China's
restrictions on exports of rare earth minerals used in
production of wind turbines, electric vehicles, solar cells and
energy efficient lighting.
 RARE EARTH MATERIALS
 ""We are very concerned about China's export restraints on
rare earth materials, antimony and tungsten"" and could still
file a case, U.S. trade representative spokeswoman Nefeterius
McPherson said.
 ""We have raised our concerns with the Chinese and we are
continuing to work closely on the issue with stakeholders.""
 Kirk's office also said it had made progress on some of the
steelworkers' concerns during the U.S.-China Joint Commission
on Commerce and Trade meeting last week in Washington.
 Beijing agreed to no longer require foreign companies
bidding for large-scale wind power projects in China to have
prior experience in China, the U.S. trade office said.
 China also recommitted to eliminating discriminatory local
content requirements in wind manufacturing and informed the
United States that two other subsidy programs challenged by the
steelworkers union had been eliminated, Kirk's office said.
 Steelworkers President Leo Gerard acknowledged progress was
made in the recent U.S.-China talks and said the steelworkers
were satisfied with the administration's approach.
 ""From day one, the USW knew that the complexity and
enormity of the case and the lack of transparency in the
Chinese system would require that we be in this for the long
haul ... The goal is not litigation; it's to end their
practices,"" Gerard said.
 Representative Sander Levin, a senior Democrat, said the
inability of U.S. Trade Representative's office to fully
investigate all of the union's charges in the time allotted
under U.S. law showed it ""lacks sufficient tools and resources
to quickly and effectively address the full range of China's
trade-distorting policies.""

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The euro dropped to a record
low against the Swiss franc for the sixth straight day on
Wednesday, with losses accelerating on concern the euro zone
debt crisis will continue well into 2011.
 The euro fell below 1.25 Swiss francs, down about 16
percent so far this year, as deteriorating debt troubles in
peripheral economies and fears of contagion enhanced the
safe-haven status of the Swiss currency.
 The options market signaled further downside for the pair
and speculative positioning data showed an increase in bets in
favor of the franc. Morgan Stanley said this week it expects
the euro to fall to 1.20 Swiss francs in 2011.
 ""We view the surging Swiss franc heading into year end as
an ominous warning sign for further trouble ahead in the euro
zone in early 2011,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at
the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London.
 ""It appears that smart money investors are preemptively
bailing funds out of the euro zone with Switzerland providing a
safe port to ride out the euro zone sovereign debt storm that
appears to loom on the horizon,"" Hardman said.
 The euro  was last down 0.8 percent at 1.2448
Swiss francs. It hit as low as $1.2448 on trading platform EBS
after taking out option barriers at 1.2500, traders said.
 The euro  slipped 0.1 percent against the dollar
to $1.3088, reversing gains sparked by a report that China was
ready to buy significant amounts of Portuguese sovereign debt.
It had earlier risen to a session peak of $1.3183, bouncing off
its near three-week trough of $1.3073 set on Tuesday.
 The Jornal de Negocios daily newspaper reported China is
looking to buy between 4 billion euros ($5.26 billion) and 5
billion euros of Portuguese sovereign debt to help the country
ward off pressure in debt markets, though it gave no details of
its sources. [ID:nLDE6BL0MW]. China's central bank declined to
comment on the report.
 EURO DOWNSIDE
 Euro/Swiss franc risk reversals moved further in favor of a
euro downside this week as spot rates repeatedly hit all-time
lows.
 One-month 25-delta euro/Swiss  risk
reversals last traded at around 2.10, with a bias toward puts,
suggesting more investors are betting the euro will fall
against the Swiss franc than rise. In mid-December, one-month
risk reversals were around $1.90.
 The latest IMM data from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed speculators boosted long positions in the
Swiss franc in the week ending Dec. 14. The number likely
increased further this week given the rally in the franc.
 Goldman Sachs said its implied IMM EUR/CHF positioning
score stands at -4.5, the same level as in August and
consistent with a relatively stretched short positioning that
has been exceeded only rarely in the past.
 ""Overall it appears there is still no end in sight to the
unwinding of legacy EUR/CHF carry trades, but maybe the start
of a new fiscal year may offer some respite from January
onward,"" the firm said in a research note. ""The wild card
however is the extent to which the exchange rate starts to hurt
the Swiss economy.""
 Against the yen, the euro fell 0.3 percent to 109.32
. The dollar lost 0.2 percent to 83.52 yen 
after data showed U.S. economic growth was a touch higher than
previously estimated in the third quarter, but below
expectations. See [ID:nN21260995]
 In the near term dealers expect range-bound trade, with
one-month implied volatility on dollar/yen falling below 9.5
percent , the lowest since late 2007.

 NEW YORK, Dec 22 (Reuters) - World stocks advanced on
Wednesday on growing optimism about global economic growth
while the euro slumped to near-lifetime lows against the Swiss
franc after debt warnings on Portugal and Greece.
 The price of oil topped $90 a barrel as a cold snap
prolonged severe disruptions in Europe.
 Stocks have been on a tear so far this month as money
managers reallocated capital, anticipating improving economic
data and robust corporate earnings, according to a Reuters
poll. For details, see [ID:nLDE6BL0B2]
 U.S. Treasury prices and the dollar edged up after data
showed U.S. third-quarter economic growth was a touch higher
than previously estimated, but consumer spending was softer.

 ""The more recent data suggests we're seeing reasonably
healthy retail sales growth, pretty healthy investment
spending, and some growth in employment. So maybe the core
growth or final sales growth is starting to accelerate in the
fourth quarter,"" said Zach Pandl, economist at Nomura
Securities International in New York.
 He called the report ""a modest positive for the Treasury
market and a modest negative for risky assets.""
 European shares hit a fresh 27-month high and U.S. equities
followed in kind, extending four days of gains that drove the
S&P 500 to levels not reached since before Lehman Brothers went
bankrupt two years ago.
 With moves exagerated by thin pre-holiday trade, Europe's
FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> tacked on 0.3 percent to
1,148.81.
 The index was boosted by a 9.3 percent surge in ARM

 WARNINGS ON GREECE, PORTUGAL
 Moody's warning Tuesday that it may cut Portugal's rating
and a Fitch statement that it may downgrade Greece reminded
investors that euro zone debt problems still flared and fueled
a euro selloff.
 The single currency faltered to 1.2515 Swiss francs, near
its weakest level since launching in 1999. However, the euro
gained some respite against a broadly lower dollar on a
Portuguese newspaper report that China was ready to buy 4
billion to 5 billion euros worth of Portuguese sovereign debt.
[ID:nLDE6BL0MW]
 Beijing offered no comment on the report, leaving investors
in the bond market unconvinced and sovereign bonds of smaller
European countries under pressure.
 ""There's been no clarity on what European Union leaders
will do to deal with the debt crisis,"" said Investec economist
Philip Shaw. ""That uncertainty, coupled with the threat of
downgrades to various peripheral countries, has led to more
spread widening and a weaker euro.""
 The euro  nudged lower against the dollar, down 0.08
percent to $1.3085, while the dollar <.DXY> gained 0.04 percent
against a basket of major currencies. Versus the Japanese yen,
the dollar  fell 0.32 percent to 83.46.
 The credit rating warnings and weakening dollar helped
boost the appeal of gold as a safe-haven asset. Gold 
firmed to $1,386.50 an ounce, building on three straight
sessions of gains. The price was also underpinned after the
International Monetary Fund said it completed a massive gold
reserve sale that began a year ago. [ID:nN21131060]

 * Says any move in rates possible, and sooner than f'cast
 
(Adds Governor comments, analyst)
 By Jana Mlcochova and Robert Mueller
 PRAGUE, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The Czech central bank held
borrowing costs as expected on Wednesday, and said mounting
uncertainty over how the euro zone's debt crisis will play out
meant the direction of its next rate move was unclear.
 All analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast the bank would
keep the two-week repo rate at a record low 0.75 at its final
meeting of 2010.
 A majority believed rates would start to rise by the middle
of 2011, later than elsewhere in central Europe, as growth
slowed while inflation stayed benign. None had forecast a cut.
 Governor Miroslav Singer told a news conference the euro
zone's debt struggles, rising commodity prices and Germany's
economic outperformance were close to becoming risks to the
bank's outlook.
 ""They are certainly significant uncertainties,"" Singer said.
""They have the capability to turn into relatively big risks that
may force us into some moves earlier than what we expect now
according to the forecast, whether that be up or down.
 The market did not react to Singer's comments, with the
shortest-dated forward rate agreement, showing three-month rates
in one months time, unchanged at 1.219/279 percent.
 The crown was flat in slow holiday trade at 25.26 to the
euro.
 
 'LEAVING THE DOOR OPEN'
 ""Any further easing is (or should be) in our view out of
question but bankers obviously leave the doors open for anything
that may come,"" Ceska Sporitelna analyst Martin Lobotka said in
a note following the bank's news conference.
 The bank voted 6-1 to hold the repo rate, used to skim
surplus liquidity, for the eighth month running.
 One board member, as yet unnamed, voted for a 25 basis point
rise. Ratesetter Eva Zamrazilova had voted for a hike at the
past two meetings.
 The bank's latest forecast in November showed a rise in
interest rates starting towards the end of 2011.
 But Singer's comments chimed in with signs of a recent shift
towards a more dovish outlook from a second ratesetter.
 Vice Governor Mojmir Hampl told Reuters last week that
fallout from the euro zone debt crisis was increasingly likely
and policy could be eased if it materialised.
 Singer said on Wednesday it was possible to observe a
""double-track"" development in the economy with one part still
struggling to get out of crisis while some companies were
already planning their next expansion.
 He added risks to the bank's forecast were balanced and the
economic development showed the bank's forecast was
materialising.
 Lower than forecast growth in nominal wages was the key
downside risk while growing commodity prices and a weaker crown
rate were the main upside risks, he said.
 The bank surprised markets with its economic outlook in
November in which it predicted the next year's GDP growth at 1.2
percent, a sharp deceleration from this year's expected 2.3
percent. It said budget cuts, among others, will knock growth
down.
 The Polish central bank also kept rates on hold on Wednesday
and is seen hiking early in 2011, while Hungary's central bank
raised borrowing costs to 5.75 percent on Monday.

 By Sven Egenter and Catherine Bosley
 ZURICH, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank is not
likely to resume its interventions just yet, though the franc
has hit new records against the euro, since they have become
politically unpopular and there is little risk of deflation.
 The Swiss franc has risen more than 15 percent against the
euro this year and soared to a fresh all-time peak on Wednesday
as investors worried about debts in the euro zone sought a safe
haven.
 Yet the economy is expected to grow 1.5 percent in 2011 and
further forays into markets are not yet likely after the SNB
came under heavy fire for posting an 8.5 billion franc ($8.91
billion) loss in the first nine months, due in part to forex
interventions.
 Tony Nyman of Informa Global Markets said the chance of new
intervention was pretty low: ""They have lost a lot of money from
intervening and got criticised for it.""
 Between March 2009 and June 2010 the SNB sold over 200
billion francs, yet it dropped interventions saying deflationary
pressures had dissipated. 
 Last December, the key level for euro-Swiss was 1.50. The
SNB dropped its intervention pledge in June when the franc was
around 1.39 and the pair has risen steadily since then, briefly
rising as high as 1.2484, according to Reuters data.
 At the SNB's policy review last week, when interest rates
were kept ultra-low, Chairman Philipp Hildebrand dodged
questions about the likelihood of further interventions and
reiterated the bank would take the measures necessary to ensure
price stability.
 Switzerland weathered the global downturn better than many
other countries and Hildebrand also said the strong recovery was
limiting the risk of deflation. The SNB forecast inflation of
0.4 percent in 2011.
 ""While deflation is off the radar I do not expect them to
come back,"" Nyman also said.
 
 TRADE IMPACT 
 Although exports have held up surprisingly well so far, the
strong franc is slowing export growth, particularly to the euro
zone, Switzerland's biggest trading partner. The SNB has also
warned of a slowdown in growth owing to weaker exports.
 ""If you see too strong an appreciation in too short a time
period, there might be an increasing concern for intervention,
but we haven't seen that yet,"" said Credit Suisse analyst Sven
Schubert, who does not see the franc breaching the 1.20 per euro
mark. ""But the risk is increasing at least for some verbal
comments.""
 Swiss Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf on Wednesday
denied media reports of Hildebrand warning in a closed-door
meeting the franc could rise up to 0.5 per euro. The Swiss paper
Sonntag reported that in a cabinet meeting on Dec. 10,
Hildebrand had backed Swiss participation in the IMF's euro zone
rescue package so as to prevent the franc from climbing to 0.50
per euro.
 Analysts at Kepler Capital Markets expect earnings
forecasts for Swiss firms to be cut by 3 to 4 percentage points
due to the franc as many firms take a hit to their margins as
currency hedges roll off.
 Nevertheless, the KOF economic research institute expects
exports to expand 3.2 percent next year despite the strong
franc, as demand from Asia offsets lower sales to Europe and
North America.
 Swiss exporters specialise in high-tech goods and
pharmaceuticals, which may also be more resistant to currency
swings.
 Yet were the SNB to venture back into markets, now could be
an ideal time as thin year-end trading would make any big salvos
less pricey.
 ""The downward trend of the euro is clear, but investors need
to be careful in the holiday period because lack of liquidity
can cause large countermoves,"" a currency trader said.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a record low
against the Swiss franc on Wednesday, with losses seen
accelerating on concern the euro zone debt crisis will continue
well into 2011.
 But the euro edged up versus the dollar, helped by a report
that China was ready to buy significant amounts of Portuguese
sovereign debt and after data showed a smaller-than-expected
upward revision to U.S. third-quarter economic growth.
 The euro fell as low as 1.2493 Swiss francs on trading
platform EBS, down about 16 percent so far this year, as
deteriorating debt problems in peripheral euro zone economies
enhanced the safe-haven status of the Swiss currency.
 ""We view the surging Swiss franc heading into year end as
an ominous warning sign for further trouble ahead in the euro
zone in early 2011,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at
the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London.
 ""It appears that smart money investors are preemptively
bailing funds out of the euro zone with Switzerland providing a
safe port to ride out the euro zone sovereign debt storm that
appears to loom on the horizon,"" Hardman said.
 In early trading, the euro was down 0.4 percent at 1.2509
Swiss francs, after taking out option barriers at 1.2500
francs, traders said.
 The euro was up 0.1 percent against the dollar at $1.3082,
having hit a session high of $1.3183 and above its near
three-week trough of $1.3073 set on Tuesday.
 The Jornal de Negocios daily newspaper reported China is
looking to buy between 4 billion euros ($5.26 billion) and 5
billion euros of Portuguese sovereign debt to help the country
ward off pressure in debt markets, though it gave no details of
its sources.. China's central bank declined to comment on the
report.
 ""This is a small positive for the euro,"" said Valentin
Marinov, currency strategist at CitiFX.
 ""The net supply in the first quarter is projected to reach
6 billion euros. If that is confirmed and China is willing to
buy 4-5 billion euros it will reduce some of the funding
pressures on Portugal.""
 News that the ECB had allocated 149.5 billion euros in its
three-month tender dented sentiment slightly, as it showed a
greater-than-expected reliance by European banks on cheap
funding.
 With liquidity drying up ahead of the Christmas holiday,
Marinov expected the euro to underperform against riskier
currencies like the Australian dollar and the Scandinavian
currencies.
 Against the yen, the euro was fell 0.3 percent to 109.41.
The dollar also declined 0.3 percent to 83.49 yen.
 The dollar extended declines after data showed U.S.
economic growth was a touch higher than previously estimated in
the third quarter, but below expectations. See
 ""The data suggest that the economy enters the fourth
quarter on a slightly softer footing than initially expected,""
said Joe Manimbo, currency trader at Travelex Global Business
Payments in Washington. ""But I think the number at this point
is fairly stale, so it may not have a dramatic impact on the
U.S. currency today.""
 In the near term dealers expect range-bound trade, with
one-month implied volatility on dollar/yen falling below 9.5
percent, the lowest since late 2007.

 * JC virus status potential factor in brain infection risk
 * Elan shares up 1 percent

(Adds details, background)
 LONDON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Elan and Biogen Idec have asked
regulators for a green light to change the label on multiple
sclerosis drug Tysabri to recommend a virus test that may help
predict the risk of serious brain infection.
 The test can identify an antibody to the JC virus, which the
two drugmakers said was a potential factor contributing to the
risk of patients on the drug developing progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy (PML).
 ""These filings are part of the companies' ongoing commitment
to actively identify and address potential risk factors for PML
in Tysabri-treated patients,"" the companies said in a statement
on Wednesday.
 Shares in Ireland's Elan were 1 percent higher in a flat
European drugs sector by midsession following news of the
submissions to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the
European Medicines Agency.
 Biogen last week reported four more cases of PML among
patients on Tysabri, bringing the total number of confirmed
cases as of Dec. 2 to 79, with 16 deaths.
 Biogen, which markets the drug with Elan, said the rate of
PML cases per 1,000 patients had edged slightly higher to 1.0
from 0.96 and was likely due to more patients being on the drug
for more than two years.
 The chances of contracting PML tends to increase the longer
a patient is on the drug, which is considered the most important
growth driver for both Biogen and Elan. The incidence of PML
cases per 1,000 patients who have received between 1 to 12
infusions of Tysabri is just 0.01, but that rises to 2.05 at
more than 24 infusions, according to Biogen's statistics.
 Tysabri was briefly pulled from the U.S. market due to
concerns over PML. But the drug was so effective compared to
other available treatments that MS patients considered the risk
worth taking and clamoured for its return.
 Health regulators agreed to make it available with certain
restrictions, including close monitoring and reporting of PML
cases.

 (Adds detail, reaction)
 By Peter Griffiths and Christina Fincher
 LONDON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - British economic growth figures
so far this year have been revised slightly lower and 2011 may
see a sharper slowdown due to government spending cuts, with the
Bank of England also increasingly worrried about inflation.
 The Office for National Statistics revised down third
quarter growth to 0.7 percent from 0.8 percent and said growth
in the first two quarters of the year was also slightly weaker
than previously reported.
 Hopes of a long-awaited rebalancing of Britain's economy
were also dashed. The revised figures showed net trade was a
drag on growth in the third quarter, rather than contributing to
the recovery as previously assumed.
 ""The raft of UK data do little to improve the prospects for
the economy next year,"" said Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics.
""A continued strong recovery seems far from assured.""
 The government, accused by the opposition of risking the
recovery with cuts that are too deep and too fast, insisted a
""gradual but sustained"" private sector-led recovery remained on
track. But business groups warned against withdrawing support
from the economy too swiftly.
 ""Since we have not yet seen the impact of the increase in
VAT and the large spending cuts set to take effect in 2011, it
is critical to take measures that ensure the recovery
continues,"" said David Kern, chief economist at the British
Chambers of Commerce.

 PAIN AHEAD
 Britain's coalition government aims to cut spending by 81
billion pounds and raise taxes by 29 billion pounds by 2014/15
to close a budget deficit that has risen to a record peacetime
high.
 It is hoping the fiscal squeeze may be softened by loose
monetary policy, but surprisingly stubborn inflation may leave
the Bank of England little scope for manoeuvre.
 Minutes to the central bank's latest policy meeting showed
the Monetary Policy Committee retained its three-way split this
month, but more members are becoming worried about medium-term
inflation risks.
 Inflation in Britain rose to a six-month high of 3.3 percent
last month and is expected to remain well above the BoE's 2
percent target for at least another year.
 Money markets, which as recently as October were pricing in
a more than 50 percent chance of another wave of quantitative
easing, are warming to the view that the BoE's next move will be
to tighten policy -- probably towards the end of next year.
 The combination of stubborn inflation and slowing growth
bodes poorly for the government which is already fighting to
preserve coalition unity.
 A desire to bring forward big-ticket purchases ahead of
January's rise in VAT sales tax will support fourth-quarter GDP
growth, but the start of 2011 will be the big challenge.
 Growth in the construction sector, a key driver of the
recovery between April and September, has already started to
slow.

 GOVERNMENT SPENDING CUTS
 A breakdown of Wednesday's figures showed government
spending fell by 0.4 percent between July and September. That
was the biggest quarterly fall since the start of 2009 and was
before the bulk of the government's austerity measures kick in.
 Evidence that Britons are already bracing themselves for
tough times came from a rise in the household saving ratio, to
5.0 percent from 3.5 percent in the second quarter.
 Downward revisions to prior data meant second quarter growth
was shaved to 1.1 percent from 1.2 percent and first quarter
growth was revised down to 0.3 percent from 0.4 percent.
 George Buckley, UK economist at Deutsche Bank, noted there
were some optimistic signs in Wednesday's GDP release -- real
incomes had bounced back, corporate profits were decent, and
growth for most of the year, even with the downward revisions,
was higher than analysts would have guessed at the start of the
year.
 However, he noted the disappointing contribution from
exports.
 Balance of payments data showed Britain's deficit with the
rest of the world widened to 9.568 billion pounds in the third
quarter from 5.22 billion in the second.

 * Bailout fears push euro zone stocks further out of favour
 
 By Sinead Cruise
 LONDON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - British fund managers upped their
exposure to UK equities during December, buoyed by hopes of
bumper dividends from cash-rich companies and expectations of a
2011 takeover boom, a Reuters poll has found.
 A survey of 12 investment managers showed the average
allocation in global equity portfolios to UK stocks jumped to
16.3 percent from 12.6 percent in November, indicating strong
confidence in Britain's economic outlook and the relative value
of UK stocks over ""fashionable"" emerging market equities.
 ""It is possible that we might run with our maximum equity
weightings next year, although our focus will be on 'quality'
companies in the developed world markets, which our research
suggests are trading at an almost unprecedented discount to
emerging market and lesser-quality companies,"" Thomas Becket,
chief investment officer of PSigma Investment Management, said.
 Becket said many UK companies were in compelling financial
shape, holding large sums of surplus cash that may find its way
back to investors in the form of dividends and share buybacks.
 That same cash could also help fuel fresh merger and
acquisitions activity in 2011, he said. [ID:nN1766841]
 Based on data provided by the same 11 fund managers polled
last month, allocations to UK equities rose to 13.3 percent.
 While the overall equities allocation climbed 1.4 percentage
points to 54.2 percent in December, fund managers cut euro zone
equity holdings again amid fears of economic contraction across
the region, particularly in Portugal and Spain. [ID:nLDE6AS154]
 Average euro zone equity allocations dropped to 14.5 percent
from 15.2 percent on a like-for-like basis, and even lower still
to 13.8 percent in December's enlarged poll.
 ""It is unclear as to how the Euro zone periphery situation
will be resolved,"" said Alec Letchfield, chief investment
officer, UK Wealth, at HSBC Global Asset Management.
 ""What is clear, however, is that greater unity is required
in the European policy response ... the disparity in growth
rates between core Europe and peripheral Europe are, if
anything, likely to widen further,"" he said.
 Although sentiment towards euro zone stocks continued to
wane in the last poll of 2010, respondents flagged a growing
appetite for riskier investments like hedge funds and private
equity, with the average exposure to alternatives rising to 16.4
percent based on the enlarged poll sample -- the highest level
seen in more than a year. [ID:nLDE6BJ0YS]
 Exposure to cash fell for the fifth consecutive month to 4.9
percent from 6.3 percent in November.
 Investment managers sharply cut their percentage allocations
to UK gilts in their global bond portfolios in December, in the
same month a Bank of England survey revealed expectations for
inflation over the next 12 months had accelerated to 3.9
percent, almost double central bank targets. [ID:nBELGNE630]
 Average allocations slumped to 17.9 percent from 20.7
percent on a like-for-like basis, and to 17.3 percent in the

 * Polls show increase in equity exposure
 * Bond holdings cut back, EM losing favour
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Investors are entering 2011 in a
relatively bullish mood, raising equity holdings to a 10-month
high, increasing exposure to high-yield credit and cutting back
on government debt, Reuters polls showed on Wednesday.
 Within bond portfolios, however, concern about the cost of
U.S. Treasuries and the stability of euro zone debt, did not
show up dramatically.
 Allocations to emerging market debt were cut instead.
 Surveys of 55 leading investment houses in the United
States, Europe ex UK, Japan and Britain showed investors holding
54.1 percent of a typical mixed-asset portfolio in stocks in
December.
 That was up from 53.2 percent in November and the highest
since 55.4 percent in February.
 Bonds were cut to 33.9 percent, the lowest since February,
from 34.2 percent in November. Cash was at 3.9 percent, down
from 4.6 percent.
 A combination of improving economic data and a belief in
future, robust, corporate earnings has lifted investor appetite
for equities over the past few months. The MSCI all-country
world stock index was flirting with levels last seen in
September 2008 on Wednesday.
""People are coming off the sidelines and buying stocks,""
said Keith Wirtz, president and chief investment officer at
Fifth Third Asset Management in Cincinnati.
 There was also sign of risk appetite in an increased
exposure to riskier, higher yield bonds.
 At the same time concerns have risen that yields on
benchmarket government bonds are too low, providing little
return and threatening a sell-off.
 Investors in the Reuters polls did cut back overall exposure
to bonds. But when it came to the money left for bonds they
favoured U.S. and euro zone government debt over most emerging
markets, which have been very popular this year.
 Exposure to emerging market debt was 8.1 percent of a bond
portfolio for the month, compared with 9.6 percent a month
earlier.
 Investors also regained some composure about euro zone
government bonds following the crisis over Ireland's debt. They
raised exposure within a bond portfolio to 31.5 percent from
31.2 percent, although these numbers remain well below the more
than 42 percent seen at the beginning of 2010.

 REGIONALLY
U.S. fund managers built up their equity holdings in
December to one of the highest points this year on signs of a
swifter economic recovery.
 The poll, which surveyed 13 U.S.-based fund management
companies, showed firms boosting their equity allocations for
the fourth month in a row to an average of 65.0 percent, two
percentage points over November.
 The Reuters poll also showed money managers scaling back
their exposure to bonds for a fourth consecutive month, to 27.9
percent of their portfolios in December, compared with 30.2
percent last month.
 Japanese fund managers held on to most of their global stock
weighting in the month and raised their bond allocation to the
highest level since September on the view that recent falls in
bond prices were overdone.
 The 13 respondents also lowered their cash position to the
lowest level in more than a year.
 Asset managers' average weighting for global equities in the
Japanese poll fell only 0.1 percentage point from the previous
month to 47.1 percent. The weighting for bonds rose to 48.3
percent in December from 46.9 percent last month.
 Cash was at 2.5 percent.
 European fund managers lifted equity holdings to a 11-month
high and also boosted bonds.
 The survey of 17 Europe-based asset management firms outside
Britain released showed a typical mixed portfolio holding 50.1
percent in equities this month, compared with 49.6 percent in
November.
 It held 37.5 percent in bonds including government and
corporate debt, compared with 37.3 percent last month. Cash
holdings fell to 5.3 percent from 6.1 percent, hitting their
lowest level since January.
British fund managers increased their exposure to equities,
particularly domestic UK stocks, and cut back on bonds.
 The survey of 12 investment managers showed the average
allocation to global equities climbed to 54.2 percent from 52.8
percent.
 Bond holdings dropped to 22.0 percent from 22.5 percent.
 Exposure to UK stocks within equities jumped to 16.3 percent
from 12.6 percent in November.

1416,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2010 07:56AM ET</span>",France welcomes aircraft export credit deal," PARIS, Dec 22 (Reuters) - French ministers said they were
pleased that aircraft-producing nations had agreed a deal on
export credits, in a move that will cool long-running tensions
between airlines over the system used to sell aircraft.
Airlines have long been lobbying for a change to the rules,
which allow the home governments of U.S. manufacturer Boeing
and Europe's Airbus -- France, Germany, Spain and Britain -- to
give export financing to some, but not all carriers.
 ""The new agreement allows financial support conditions for
all civil aircraft to be unified,"" said Economic Minister
Christine Lagarde, Foreign Trade Minister Pierre Lellouche and
Transport Minister Thierry Mariani.
 They did not give details of the deal.
 A previous informal agreement between the five countries
involved meant the export credits could not be offered to
airlines based in any of the five countries where Boeing and
EADS subsidiary Airbus are based. 
 That meant an airline in an Airbus home nation, such as
British Airways, would not qualify for U.S. credits when buying
a Boeing in the same way that a U.S. airline buying an Airbus
would not secure European export credits.
 Airlines in the countries where Airbus and Boeing planes are
made say they are unfairly locked out of a system of export aid
which reduces costs for major carriers in the Gulf -- like
Emirates -- and Asia which have grabbed market share from older
rivals. 
 The role of export credit financing has increased sharply as
private financing dried up during the financial crisis and the
entry of smaller competitors such as Canada's Bombardier and
Brazil's Embraer into the market for larger planes, challenging
Airbus and Boeing's duopoly, has also brought the issue to a
head.
""This new regulatory framework takes into account the
interests of the European manufacturer Airbus, which will
continue to benefit from the state guarantee in some of its
exports,"" the French ministers said in a statement. Airbus ""will
be subject, as far as financing is concerned, to the same rules
of the game as its competitor Boeing,"" they added.
The ministers said the deal would allow for a better balance
between French, German and British airlines and their
competitors.

1417,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2010 07:52AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-China says will import to refill agricultural stocks," * Commerce Ministry seeks to import more sugar and meat
 * Also planning to stock up on other commodities as needed
 * Analysts see low stocks of corn, sugar and cotton
 
 By Niu Shuping and Tom Miles
 BEIJING, Dec 22 (Reuters) - China is set to continue to tap
international markets for farm commodities in 2011, with the
government driving demand this time to cover shortages and
replenish reserves that got dangerously run down this year.
 Commerce Minister Chen Deming told an internal ministry
meeting the government will import to shore up reserves of sugar
and meat, among other staples, according to a statement on the
ministry website on Wednesday.
 ""Given the growing pressure from price rises coupled with
tight supplies of some farm products, securing supplies will
play an important role in calming inflationary expectations and
curbing speculative activities,"" the statement said.
 ""We will increase the scale of reserves of daily necessities
such as meat and sugar, add to reserves of other commodities as
appropriate, and pick the right time to expand imports of goods
that are in short supply domestically and replenish central
reserves.""
 It gave no more details of the potential target commodities.
But the impact on world prices could be significant, judging by
the country's deliberate stockpiling of base metals last year,
its sudden call for corn imports this year, and its flip from a
major seller to a major buyer of coal since the start of 2009.
 China has run down many of its agricultural stockpiles this
year to stop strong demand driving up prices. Many markets,
especially corn, sugar, cotton and rubber, surged as speculators
borrowed cheaply to invest in hard assets and bet on demand
outpacing supply.
 The government has cooled prices in the past two months by
coming down hard on such investors, tightening monetary policy
to siphon cash from the market and raising the bar for trades on
China's big three commodity exchanges.
 But China has also helped to shore up prices by selling off
stocks of many agricultural commodities including corn, wheat,
rice, soybeans, rapeseed oil, sugar, cotton and rubber.
 Stocks of corn, sugar and cotton are thought to be below one
month's supply.
 Normally officials would have already begun stockpiling the
year's corn harvest, but this year they have held off for fear
of pushing up prices.
 
 CUPBOARD IS BARE
 With little scope for adding to its stock of land or water,
China is looking for other ways to eke more out of what it has,
including an increasing acceptance of biotechnology and a
keenness to secure supplies of fertiliser.
 Arable farming is due to get a $15 billion boost over the
next five years as China upgrades farmland, in hope of adding 50
million tonnes of grain production capacity.
 ""For long, China was self-sufficient in many products, but
maintaining this self-sufficiency has become much more difficult
due to significant demand increases and arable land
constraints,"" analysts at Rabobank said in a report on Tuesday.
 They pointed to this year's imports of sugar, the highest
for a decade, and of cotton, the second highest ever, and said
""current estimates indicate China may import up to 8 million
tonnes of corn in 2011"", which would be the highest ever.
 Government stockpiles of all three commodities are now
thought to be at very low levels after large sales this year.
 Although China is enjoying a seventh consecutive bumper
grains harvest, it faces a remorseless rise in demand because
Chinese tastes are moving more towards meat, which means more
demand for animal feed ingredients such as corn and soybeans.
 But the government is unlikely to pour imported grains
directly into its reserves because of its wariness about
contaminating its own supplies with genetically modified strains
that are not yet sanctioned for human consumption in China.
 The Commerce Ministry statement said the ministry would also
assist Chinese companies expand the sources of supplies of
grains and cotton so that they can increase imports to ease
domestic supply pressure whenever prices favour imports.
 China's top supplier of corn and cotton is the United States
while Brazil is the largest exporter of sugar to China so far in
2010. China has also increased cotton and sugar imports from
India.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The euro gained against the
dollar and bounced from all-time lows against the Swiss franc on
Wednesday, boosted by a news report that China was ready to buy
significant amounts of Portuguese sovereign debt.
 The Jornal de Negocios daily reported China is looking to
buy between 4 billion euros ($5.26 billion) and 5 billion euros
of Portuguese sovereign debt to help the country ward off
pressure in debt markets, though it gave no details of its
sources. [ID:nLDE6BL0MW].
 China's central bank declined to comment on the report which
said the deal reached between the two governments will lead to
China buying Portuguese debt in auctions or in the secondary
markets during the first quarter of 2011.
 ""This is a small positive for the euro,"" said Valentin
Marinov, currency strategist at CitiFX.
 ""The net supply in the first quarter is projected to reach 6
billion euros. If that is confirmed and China is willing to buy
4-5 billion euros it will reduce some of the funding pressures
on Portugal.""
 The euro was up 0.4 percent against the dollar at $1.3148
, having hit a session high of $1.3181 on the news and
well above its near three-week trough of $1.3073 set on Tuesday.
 Traders said news that the ECB had allocated 149.5 billion
euros in its three-month tender dented sentiment slightly, as it
showed a greater-than-expected reliance by European banks on
cheap funding. [ID:nFAE005856]
 Blows this week to the euro zone's struggling,
heavily-indebted economies have come from Moody's, which warned
it might cut Portugal's rating, and Fitch, which said the same
about Greece. [ID:nTOPNEWS]
 ""The rating agencies are not saying anything new but the
question is how does this market want to take it,"" said Geoffrey
Yu, currency strategist at UBS. ""Clearly these are terrible
market conditions and the speed at which the euro is losing
ground against the Swiss franc is a bit disconcerting.""
 The euro  was down 0.2 percent at 1.2525 Swiss
francs, having fallen to an all-time low of 1.2493 on trading
platform EBS. It took out option barriers at 1.2500 francs
en-route to fresh all-time lows, traders said.
 It also fared badly against the high-yielding Australian
dollar, , falling to a multi-year low just under
A$1.3100.
 With liquidity drying up ahead of the Christmas holiday,
Citi's Marinov expected the euro to underperform against riskier
currencies like the Australian dollar and the Scandinavian
currencies.
 
 AUSSIE UNDERPINNED BY RISK TRADES 
 The Australian currency  was underpinned by further
gains in equities and commodities, suggesting improving risk
appetite as analysts revise up forecasts for growth in 2011.
 On Tuesday the S&P 500 <.SPX> finally recovered all the
ground lost since the Lehman debacle, while the CRB commodities
index <.CRB> reached a two-year peak.
 The U.S. dollar was at 83.57 yen, down 0.2 percent for the
day, with a significant drop in U.S. yields in recent sessions
weighing on the pair.
 In the near term dealers expect range-bound trade, with
one-month implied volatility on dollar/yen falling below 9.5
percent , the lowest since late 2007.
 The dollar index <.DXY> <=USD> slipped 0.3 percent to 80.45,
which still marks a gain of more than 3 percent for the year.
 The United States is due to release its latest estimates of
gross domestic product (GDP) for the third quarter. U.S. growth
is expected to be revised up to an annualised 2.8 percent, from
2.5 percent previously.

 * Candidate lacks policy experience, views unclear
 * Analysts see downside risk for hryvnia
 
 By Olzhas Auyezov
 KIEV, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Viktor
Yanukovich has defied IMF calls for greater central bank
independence by proposing a close associate whose policy views
are unknown to head the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU).
 Yanukovich nominated Serhiy Arbuzov, 34, to succeed veteran
NBU chief Volodymyr Stelmakh on Tuesday, prompting concerns that
the hryvnia may weaken further.
 Parliament, dominated by Yanukovich supporters, is certain
to confirm Arbuzov in the job.
 ""Arbuzov's appointment could further streamline the policy
making processes in Ukraine although it is likely to have a
negative effect on the independence of the NBU, while the IMF is
advocating quite the opposite,"" VTB Capital said on Wednesday.
 Arbuzov's mother runs a small bank owned by Yanukovich's son
Oleksandr and local media say Arbuzov and Oleksandr Yanukovich
are close friends.
 This has led some analysts to believe Arbuzov would be
influenced by Ukraine's powerful ""steel lobby"", which bankrolled
Yanukovich's presidential campaign and favours a weaker hryvnia
to boost its exports.
 Before becoming first deputy chairman at the central bank in
September, Arbuzov ran a small private bank and served for three
months as chairman of state Eximbank.
 
 MARGINALLY NEGATIVE FOR HRYVNIA
 ""Arbuzov joined the NBU less than four months ago, so we
know little about his views on monetary policy,"" commented Anna
Zadornova, an economist at Goldman Sachs.
 ""But given his perceived connection to the industrial
exporters from the south of the country and lack of experience,
we think that the news is on the margin negative for the
hryvnia.""
 The hryvnia has been under downward pressure since September
as rising imports have pushed up Ukraine's current account
deficit. The central bank has intervened regularly to brake the
currency's decline.
 The NBU has ample reserves of $33.5 billion to continue
doing so, but outgoing head Stelmakh said this month the bank
would be ""vigilant"" over attempts by trading partners to gain a
competitive advantage by devaluing their own currencies.
 The International Monetary Fund, whose board was due to
decide on a $1.6 billion loan tranche later on Wednesday, has
repeatedly urged the central bank to allow greater exchange rate
flexibility after agreeing a $15 billion stand-by programme in
July.
 One-year non-deliverable forward contracts value the hryvnia
at 8.44/8.54 per dollar, down from the current rate of 7.97.
 ""There is an obvious risk that (Arbuzov's) personal stance
will be closer to the weak hryvnia policy since he represents
the ruling Regions Party,"" said Oleksandr Valchishen, an analyst
at Investment Capital Ukraine.
 Others say, however, that the widely expected reshuffle has
already been priced in by the market.
 ""There should be no significant market movements due to
these changes,"" said ING analyst Alexander Pecheritsyn.
 The hryvnia traded at 7.9690 per dollar on Wednesday,
virtually unchanged from Tuesday's close of 7.9700. Ukraine bond
spreads were 3 basis points tighter as measured in the JP Morgan
emerging market bond index which itself tightened by 2 bp.

 PRAGUE, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The Czech central bank kept
interest rates unchanged on Wednesday with inflation low and
expectations for a slowdown in growth.
 The key two-week repo rate  used to skim surplus
liquidity stays at a record low 0.75 percent for the eighth
month running.
 All 19 analysts in a Reuters poll forecast the bank would
stay put. Markets price in no change until June next year.
 The crown  was unchanged after the decision,
trading at 25.25 to the euro.
 The central bank called a news conference for 1330 GMT to
spell out reasons for the decision.
 Analysts said the bank's bleak outlook for growth in 2011
along with absence of demand-led price pressures kept
policymakers from tightening policy in December.
 Inflation was on target over the past two months and
slightly below the central bank's forecast. [ID:nLDE6B71CF]
[ID:nLDE6A218E]
 Rate stability is consistent with the bank's inflation
outlook released in November which implied tightening only at
the end of 2011.
 The bank surprised markets with that outlook in which it
predicted the next year's GDP growth at 1.2 percent, a sharp
deceleration from this year's expected 2.3 percent, saying
budget cuts, among others, will knock growth down.
 Analysts had mixed predictions as to what tone to expect at
the later news conference. Danske Bank said the bank would
""soften its rhetoric"" and a discussion about further monetary
easing could not be ruled out. 
 Bank CSOB said comments could be more hawkish because the
economy is set to develop better than the bank's forecast,
putting upward pressure on prices.
 ""Rate forecasts vary widely for next year,"" said Michal
Brozka, an analyst at Raiffeisenbank, which expects monetary
tightening to begin in the fourth quarter of 2011.
 ""The domestic economy will grow very slowly next year
because of fiscal savings and a slowdown in the euro zone, and
inflation will hold near the bank's 2 percent target.""
 The Polish central bank also decides on rates on Wednesday
and is expected to stay on hold. Hungary's central bank raised
borrowing costs to 5.75 percent on Monday. [ID:nLDE6BJ196]

(Adds detail, reaction)
 By Peter Griffiths and Christina Fincher
 LONDON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Britain's economy grew less
quickly than previously thought in the third quarter, with
falling government spending and rising household saving raising
the risk of a sharp slowdown at the start of next year.
 The Office for National Statistics said UK GDP grew 0.7
percent on the quarter, down from the 0.8 percent previously
estimated -- a move it blamed on downward revisions to
production, construction and business services.
 Growth for the previous two quarters was also revised down.
However, economists have been surprised by the resilience of the
preliminary readings and said the recent growth trend was still
better than most had dared hope.
 ""We are likely to see a further softening of GDP growth in
the fourth quarter, but taken over the year as a whole, GDP
growth will almost certainly be above most expectations at the
start of this year,"" said Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec.
 Second quarter growth was shaved to 1.1 percent from 1.2
percent previously and first quarter growth was revised down to
0.3 percent from 0.4 percent.
 Sterling fell on the figures but recouped its losses as
investors also digested minutes of the Bank of England's latest
policy meeting, which showed some members becoming more worried
about inflationary risks.
 
 GOVERNMENT SPENDING CUTS
 A breakdown of the figures showed government spending fell
by 0.4 percent in the third quarter after a rise of 0.6 percent
in the second. The fall was the largest since the start of 2009,
and will undoubtedly be followed by even sharper declines as the
government's aggressive austerity programme begins in earnest
next year.
 The household saving ratio rose to 5.0 percent from 3.5
percent in the second quarter, suggesting Britons are bracing
themselves for tough times to come.
 The government, accused by the opposition of risking the
recovery with cuts that are too deep and too fast, said its
deficit-reduction plan remained on track.
 ""This is further evidence that a gradual but sustained
private sector-led recovery is underway,"" said a Treasury
spokesman.
 On the year, growth in the third quarter was revised down to
2.7 percent from the 2.8 percent previously reported. 
 George Buckley, UK economist at Deutsche Bank, noted there
were several optimistic signs -- real incomes had bounced back
and corporate profits were decent.
 However, he noted that the contribution from exports had
turned negative.
 Balance of payments data released at the same time showed
Britain's deficit with the rest of the world widened more than
expected to 9.568 billion pounds in the third quarter from 5.22
billion in the second.

 * 3rd qtr growth revised to 0.3 pct qtr/qtr from 0.9 pct
 GENEVA, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The trend in the volume of global
exports and imports was flat in October and has still not
regained pre-crisis levels, figures from the Dutch CPB economic
research institute showed on Wednesday.
 The institute, whose trade data are used by the World Bank
and European Commission, also sharply revised down estimates for
trade growth in the third quarter and issued data showing that
trade flows are normalising after a sharp fall in 2008 and
rebound in late 2009 and early 2010.
 The figures are an indicator of overall economic activity.
 The volume of merchandise trade in October was 0.5 percent
higher than in September, when it fell 0.4 percent, it said in
its latest World Trade Monitor.
 But individual monthly figures are volatile and the
institute said a more accurate picture comes from looking at
""momentum"" -- the average of the latest three months compared
with the average of the previous three months.
 On that basis, trade momentum was 0.0 percent in October,
having slowed steadily from 6.1 percent in January at the height
of the rebound from the crisis as companies restocked
inventories leading to a surge in exports and imports.
 The institute also revised its figures for growth in world
trade in the third quarter of this year to only 0.3 percent
above second-quarter levels from a previous estimate of 0.9
percent on the basis of new information on trade prices in Asia
and Latin America.
 CPB said the October figures reflected strong import growth
in emerging Asian economies, while imports declined in the
United States for the second month in a row, but U.S. exports
jumped 3.5 percent. Latin America saw falls of 4-5 percent in
both import and export volume, it said.

By Stanley White and Rie Ishiguro	
 TOKYO, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Japan's economic growth will slow
in the fiscal year from April to only half the pace of the
current year due to weak exports and consumption, but consumer
prices will stop falling after three years of declines, the
government said.	
 Data on Wednesday also showed a pick-up in export growth in
November, but that failed to temper caution about overseas
demand because it was partly due to the yen's pullback from
15-year highs.	
 The Democratic Party-led government also cut its view of
exports and business sentiment on Wednesday as Asia's economic
recovery has shown signs of slowing.	
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan's cabinet faces a test of fiscal
discipline as it compiles a 2011/12 budget proposal due on
Friday, and its rather sobering assessment of the next year's
outlook could increase resistance to much-needed spending cuts.	
 ""The government's growth forecast is rather conservative
but
I would say it is rational and the government expects the
recovery to be sluggish,"" said Yuichi Kodama, chief economist
at Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance.	
 ""Compiling the budget is becoming more and more difficult
as
social welfare costs are increasing and there will be a toll on
other areas, because not many choices are available as reserves
are running out.""	
 
 
 SLOGGING THROUGH DEFLATION	
 The government forecast on Wednesday that gross domestic
product would grow a real 1.5 percent in fiscal 2011/12 after
climbing 3.1 percent in the current year to March 2011.	
 Overall consumer prices are projected to show flat growth
in the next financial year, which would mark the first time in
three years that the overall consumer price index (CPI)
managed to escape negative territory.	
 Japan has been slogging through deflation for much of the
past decade and the government is targeting positive CPI growth
by March 2012, as part of its drive to keep the fragile economy
on a sustainable recovery track.	
 But declaring an end to deflation may still be far off, a
Cabinet Office official said, underscoring the tentative nature
of any improvement in the CPI.	
 Exports rose 9.1 percent in November from a year earlier,
in
the first acceleration of export growth in nine months due to
shipments of steel to China, but that was less than the median
estimate for a 10.0 percent annual increase. [ID:nTOE6BL00G]	
 ""Exports expanded but weren't particularly robust,"" said
Takuji Okubo, chief economist at Societe Generale Securities.	
 ""The trend for exports is upward, but not robust enough for
Japanese companies to start investing more aggressively.""	
 In one positive sign, Japanese retail investor sentiment
towards domestic stocks showed a record improvement in December
to reach its best level in eight months, boosted by a jump in
Tokyo shares and a weaker yen, a Reuters survey showed.
[ID:nTIYMNE629]	
 The government is set to present a draft budget on Friday
for the next fiscal year starting in April. Should the overall
economy deteriorate more than the government is expecting,
policymakers may have little leeway for pump-priming given a
large fiscal debt burden.	
 The government may meet its spending and debt issuance
targets for next fiscal year, but higher taxes and spending
cuts
are needed to tackle rising welfare costs.	
 The government wants to implement comprehensive tax reform
-- a coded expression for a sales tax hike -- in fiscal
2012/13,
Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda told reporters, but it is
difficult to gauge whether the Democrats could reach a
consensus
on the sales tax in a split parliament.	
 Economists expect the economy to have contracted in the
current quarter as the expiry of stimulus measures targeting
low-emission vehicles has dented domestic demand and Japan's
key
trading partners, especially the United States and China, are
slowing down. Prime Minister Naoto Kan also said he expected
the
economy to contract in the fourth quarter.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The euro slumped to a lifetime
low versus the Swiss franc on Wednesday following credit ratings
warnings on Portugal and Greece but European shares hit a fresh
27-month high on growing optimism that the region's economic
recovery will continue next year.
 The oil price topped $90 a barrel as a cold snap continued
to wreak havoc in parts of Europe and on a drop in U.S.
inventories while Wall Street was primed for a slightly weaker
start, after climbing the previous day.
 A warning from Moody's on Tuesday that it may cut Portugal's
rating and an announcement from Fitch that it could downgrade
Greece reminded investors that euro zone debt problems were far
from over and continued to spur selling in the euro.
 The single currency fell to 1.2493 Swiss francs, its weakest
since its launch in 1999. However, it gained some respite
against a broadly lower dollar on a Portuguese newspaper
reported that China was ready to buy 4 to 5 billion euros of
Portuguese sovereign debt. [ID:nLDE6BL0MW]
 Beijing offered no comment on the report, which failed to
convince investors in the bond market as peripheral euro zone
bonds remained under pressure with markets wanting more
information on how European officials will deal with fiscal
issues in the future.
 ""There's been no clarity on what European Union leaders will
do to deal with the debt crisis,"" said Investec economist Philip
Shaw.
 ""That uncertainty, coupled with the threat of downgrades to
various peripheral countries has led to more spread widening and
a weaker euro.""
 Global stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> approached a 26-month high hit last month.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> rose to 1,147.82,
its highest intraday level since September 2008 but moves were
exaggerated by thin pre-holiday trade.
 The index was boosted by a near 9 percent surge in the share
price of UK software company ARM Holdings , which
supplies processors for Microsoft , on reports the
software giant is working on a new version of its operating
system.
 Mining shares suffered from a fall in metals prices, but
analysts said shares would remain supported through year end.
 ""Investors will be happy to see the market close off the
year with a decent gain,"" said Richard Jeffrey chief investment
officer at Cazenove Capital Management. ""There's a lot of macro
information today that may influence people's thinking on 2011.""
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei average dipped 0.2 percent, backing
away from a seven-month intraday high hit earlier in the day
after downbeat comments on the economy by Prime Minister Naoto
Kan. [ID:nnTOE6BL04C]. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index <.HSI> edged
up 0.2 percent, helped by gains in property developers.
 
 GOLD UP AS SAFE HAVEN
 Reports that China is interested in buying Portuguese debt
highlighted the currency market's focus on any possible move by
China to diversify its massive currency reserves out of dollars
and into other currencies, including the euro.
 This is seen as a reason to sell the dollar against other
currencies, although the move is expected to take place over a
very long period.
 The dollar index <.DXY> dipped 0.36 percent.
 The newspaper report offered no relief for Portuguese bonds
with 10-year yields  rising 10 basis points to 6.80
percent on persistent concerns about Portugal's debt levels and
fears it may be forced to follow Greece and Ireland and seek a
bailout.
 Yield premiums of periphery euro zone bonds over Bunds have
been trending higher with the 10-year Portuguese spread widening
around 60 basis points since the start of the month.
 Analysts expect the euro and bonds issued by euro zone
countries with ongoing debt problems to remain under pressure
from a steady drip of grim ratings news.
 Many argue that markets were already pricing even more gloom
for the euro zone's weaker members -- Greece, Portugal, Spain,
Ireland and Belgium -- and that ratings agencies were merely
playing catch-up.
 Debt and fiscal issues have plagued the euro all year, but
European stocks have largely brushed off such issues as
investors have put their money to work in equities on the view
that the global economy will continue to grow in 2011.
 Warnings from credit ratings on euro zone debt helped boost
the appeal of gold as a safe asset and the gold price 
firmed to $1,388.65 an ounce on Wednesday, building on three
straight sessions of gains.
 Copper prices  dipped to $9,365 on the London Metal
Exchange after punching a record high of $9,392 on Tuesday.
 Oil prices  rose around half a percent on the day to
$90.30 per barrel, boosted by unusually cold weather in parts of
the northern hemisphere and after American Petroleum Institute
data released late on Tuesday showed a large 5.8 million barrel
decline in weekly crude stocks, surpassing analyst expectations.

 The Office for National Statistics said UK GDP grew 0.7

BEIJING, Dec 22 (Reuters) - China will try to
import more in 2011 while keeping exports steady, Commerce
Minister Chen Deming said on Wednesday, in a sign that the
world's second-largest economy is keen to pull more weight as
a consumer.	
 In a statement on the ministry's website
www.mofcom.gov.cn, Chen said China wants to better balance its
trade account, and will step up purchases of high-tech goods
and commodities such as grains and cotton next year.	
 ""We will improve our policies and further simplify
regulations to support expansions in imports and promote trade
balance,"" Chen said.	
 Beijing, under foreign pressure to contribute to global
economic rebalancing, has taken steps to spur domestic
consumption to help reduce the economy's reliance on exports.	
 Keeping up the pressure on the euro zone to resolve its
debt crisis, Chen said Europe's debt problems posed a serious
risk to the recovery in the world economy, and that has helped
to lead to ""an extremely complicated"" 2011 trade outlook for
China.	
 Chen also warned of risks incurred by the sovereign debt
crisis in the European countries and noted that they may
undermine the foundation of world economic recovery.	
 ""Sovereign debt issue and risks in the financial system
are still far from being solved, the global economic growth
may slow down,"" he added.
On Tuesday, China urged European officials to
take urgent action to resolve simmering debt problems at
annual trade talks with the European Union, its biggest
trading partner. [ID:nTOE6BK01Q]	
 Chen said China would also study how to diversify the use
of its $2.65 trillion foreign exchange reserves, the world's
largest.	
 China will use part of its foreign exchange reserves to
support overseas ventures by domestic firms.	
 Chen also urged developed countries to remove restrictions
on exports of high-tech products to China, which is seen by
Beijing as one of the major reasons behind China's swelling
trade surplus.

 By Chikafumi Hodo and Mari Terawaki
 TOKYO, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Japanese retail investor sentiment
towards domestic stocks made a record improvement in December to
reach its best level in eight months, boosted by a jump in Tokyo
shares and a weaker yen, a Reuters survey showed on Wednesday.
 The benchmark Nikkei average has rallied 13 percent since
early November, lifting the key sentiment index from a near
18-month low, and survey respondents saw more gains in store for
Tokyo stocks over the coming months.
 Almost 29 percent of investors polled said the Nikkei, which
has lagged other major global indexes this year, could climb as
far as 11,000-11,500 by the end of the current financial year in
March. That would be up about 6 to 11 percent from current
levels.
 Some 24 percent saw the Nikkei rising to 11,500-12,000 during
the same period, while another 24 percent predicted
10,500-11,000, the survey showed.
 ""Japanese shares have been overlooked despite being
undervalued, but they are now being re-evaluated and being
bought,"" said a pensioner in his 70s.
 The Reuters sentiment index, calculated by subtracting the
percentage of investors who say they are bearish from those who
are bullish, jumped 58 points to minus 2 in December.
 That was the highest reading since April, when the index
posted a positive reading for first time in nearly three years.
 The Reuters survey of 412 Japanese individual investors was
conducted Dec. 6-9, during which time the Nikkei reached a
seven-month high on buying led by foreign investors.
 A weaker yen against the dollar also helped lift the index.
The Japanese currency had been approaching its all-time high of
79.75 recorded in April 1995 but halted its advance and has since
drifted down towards 83-84 yen.
 Respondents said the Nikkei would advance further towards the
end of March as a weaker yen would help earnings of
export-oriented companies and prompt inflows from foreign
investors.
 The survey also showed 39 percent of respondents thought a
further weakening of the yen would be the most important factor
for gains in Japanese stocks.
 ""We are hoping to see more foreign investor buying of
Japanese stocks, which have lagged behind others,"" said an
investor in his 40s.
 The Nikkei has risen more than 13 percent since early
November as overseas investors piled into the market, which is
still down about 2 percent since the start of the year. By
contrast, the Dow Jones industrial average has risen more than 10
percent this year.
 ""Looking at the price to book ratio and the price to earnings
ratio the market is too pessimistic about Japanese stocks. Share
prices are simply too undervalued, so they should be rising in
the short to medium term,"" said a pensioner in his 60s.

 * Fund managers' cash position lowest since Aug 2009
 * Weighting for Japan stocks at 29 pct -- highest since 2004
 By Akiko Takeda and Chikafumi Hodo
 TOKYO, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Japanese fund managers slightly cut
their global stock weighting in December, while they raised their
bond allocation to the highest level since September on the view
that recent falls in bond prices were overdone, a Reuters survey
showed.
 Fund managers lowered their cash position to the lowest level
in more than a year as receding concerns over the outlook of the
global economy prompted a shift to equities and bonds.
 ""Stocks will remain in an upward trend, but they could enter
a brief corrective phase as uncertainty remains in the global
economy,"" said Yuichi Kodama, an economist at Meiji Yasuda Life.
 ""The domestic economy is still struggling, but Japanese
corporate earnings are expected to stay healthy and valuations of
Japanese stocks remain cheap,"" Kodama said.
 Asset managers' average weighting for global equities in
December fell for the first time in five months, but fell only
0.1 percentage point from the previous month to 47.1 percent.
 The weighting for bonds rose to 48.3 percent in December, up
1.4 percentage points from 46.9 percent last month.
 ""Share prices have been solid, but on the other hand, bond
prices have come down sharply. The move (in the bond market)
appears to be overdone, so in the short term we need to watch out
for a reversal,"" said Yoshinori Nagano, a senior strategist at
Daiwa Asset Management.
 Fund managers' cash position fell to 2.5 percent -- the
lowest since August 2009 -- from 3.2 percent in November.
 Their weighting for alternative assets fell to 0.8 percent,
the lowest since the survey for that category started in January.
 The weighting for property was unchanged at 1.2 percent.
 The Reuters poll of 13 asset management companies was
conducted Dec. 8-16 when Japan's benchmark Nikkei average stood
near seven-month highs.
 A weaker yen against the dollar also helped lifted Japanese
shares and bolstered the outlook of the economy.
 Japanese government bonds came under selling pressure in
tandem with U.S. Treasuries. The 10-year JGB yield hit a
seven-month high of 1.295 percent.
 In terms of regional equities allocations, the weighting for
Japan rose 1.9 percentage points to 29.0 percent, the highest
since October 2004, as the Nikkei average has risen more than 13
percent since early November.
 Fund managers raised weightings for the United States/Canada
and Britain, while they lowered their weighting for the euro
zone, the poll showed.
 Fund managers' weighting for bonds in Japan rose to 34.3
percent, setting a record high for the third straight month.
 Bond allocation for the U.S./Canada and Britain rose, while
exposure to the euro zone and Asia dropped.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The euro won a reprieve after
plumbing new lows on the Swiss franc and Australian dollar on
Wednesday but the single currency is seen stuck in a slow descent
as a steady drip of grim ratings news erodes confidence in it.
 The latest blows came from Moody's, which warned it might cut
Portugal's rating, and Fitch, which said the same about Greece.
 ""Though one might suppose the market had become somewhat
desensitized to such news, evidence suggests otherwise as
periphery-bund spreads widen again and EUR remains under
pressure,"" David Watt, a senior currency strategist at RBC
Dominion, said in a note to clients.
 A dearth of liquidity and talk of bids by Asian central banks
helped limit the euro's fall against the dollar for now.
 The euro gained 0.2 percent in Asia to $1.3129, climbing
above its 200-day moving average of $1.3098 and off a near
three-week trough of $1.3073 set on Tuesday
 But it fared less well against the safe-haven Swiss franc and
high-yielding Australian dollar.
 ""EUR/CHF is going deeper into uncharted territory having
broken 1.26, and continuing to dig deeper,"" said Watt, as the
euro slid to a new low of 1.2533 francs for a loss of almost 4
percent so far this month.
 Traders said some investors had been shifting funds away from
euro zone bonds to the Swiss franc.
 Possible near-term targets include 1.2300, while in the
longer term it could look to around 1.1760, an Elliot wave
equality target, though the franc's low yield may deter fund
inflows.
 The euro stood at A$1.3180 after shedding 2 cents in as many
sessions. For the year it is off 17 percent.
 ""From near A$2.0 in March 2009, EUR/AUD has been under
relentless downward pressure,"" Watt said. ""The recent move
suggests an acceleration to the downside, with 1.30 in focus.""
 The Australian currency was underpinned by further gains in
equities and commodities, suggesting improving risk appetite as
analysts revise up forecasts for global growth in 2011.
 On Tuesday the S&P 500 finally recovered all the ground lost
since the Lehman debacle, while the CRB commodities index reached
a two-year peak.
 ""In the currency and European bond markets risk aversion is
prevailing. But in many other markets we've seen risk-taking,""
said Tohru Sasaki, chief strategist at JPMorgan Chase Bank.
 ""This may indicate that the world's financial markets are
becoming bubbly, driven by excess liquidity. Asset prices could
rise further if European problems stabilise, which would probably
mean a rise in cross/yen as well as a fall in dollar/yen.""
 The dollar has fallen almost 10 yen since the end of 2009. On
Wednesday it was going nowhere at 83.74 yen, sandwiched between
bids under 83.50 and offers above 84.50.
 In the near term there are strong expectations of range-bound
trade, with one-month implied volatility on dollar/yen falling
below 9.5 percent, the lowest since late 2007.
 The U.S. currency fared better against sterling, which took a
blow from news of a record British borrowing requirement and
slipped to a near three-month low of $1.5463.
 The dollar index slipped 0.2 percent to 80.54, which marks a
gain of 3.4 percent for the year but still leaves it more than 9
percent below the June peak of 88.708.
 The United States and Britain are due to release their latest
estimates of gross domestic product (GDP) for the third quarter.
U.S. growth is seen likely to be revised up to an annualised 2.8
percent, from 2.5 percent previously.
 More importantly, recent upbeat data on consumer spending has
led analysts to sharply lift their forecasts for growth this
quarter, while the surprisingly aggressive package of tax cuts
agreed this month has boosted estimates for all of 2011.

 * Deficit offset by earthquake insurance payments
 * NZ dollar and debt unmoved by data
(Adds comments, updates market reaction)	
 By Mantik Kusjanto	
 WELLINGTON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - New Zealand's annual
current account deficit widened in the September quarter as
foreign investors' earnings improved, but insurance payments
on earthquake damage eased pressure on the gap and will
continue to do so into 2011.	
 Insurance payments coming into the country following the
7.1 earthquake in September will help the current account
deficit narrow in the first quarter of next year to its
smallest in two decades, the central bank forecasts.	
 But payments to foreign investors and increased imports as
the economy pulls out of the global financial crisis will drag
the deficit wider again in coming years, an outlook that
prompted Standard & Poor's to warn last month of a possible
ratings downgrade.	
 The current account deficit swelled to NZ$5.93 billion
($4.39 billion) for the year to Sept 30 from a revised NZ$5.71
billion for the year to June 30, data showed on Wednesday.	
 The gap was the equivalent of 3.1 percent of GDP, slightly
narrower that a forecast in a Reuters poll of 3.4 percent of
GDP.	
 Statistics New Zealand, the government's data agency,
estimated insurance firms brought NZ$1.7 billion into the
economy to cover claims against the earthquake that struck the
Canterbury region of the South Island on Sept. 4.
[ID:nN03116461]	
 ""Stripping that out, things are starting to deteriorate
again and we expect the deficit to widen over the course of
next year, but to levels that are sustainable relative to
history,"" said Goldman Sachs economist Philip Borkin.	
 The New Zealand dollar was unmoved, sitting around
$0.7428 and interest rate futures <0#NBB:> were also flat.	
 The data underlined the Reserve Bank of New
Zealand's interest rate thinking, analysts said. 
 It left its cash rate unchanged at 3.0 percent on Dec. 8
amid a soft economic outlook and said rate rises over the next
two years would likely be modest. [ID:nSGE6B70E]	
 The data showed a strong trade surplus, albeit steadying,
with export earnings offsetting growth in imports as the
economy recovers slowly following recession during the
financial crisis.	
 Excluding the reinsurance impact, the current account
deficit would have risen to 3.8 percent of GDP.	
 However, the investment deficit -- the gap between
earnings for foreign investors in New Zealand, and the
country's foreign investments -- widened further to NZ$10.7
billion in the year to the end of September. 
 Lower spending by tourists also helped swell the current
account deficit.	
 The current account deficit in the September quarter
widened to NZ$1.77 billion from a revised NZ$987 million in
the June quarter.	
 The central bank has forecast the annual current account
deficit will shrink to 1.9 percent of GDP by March 2011, the
smallest gap in almost 22 years, as insurance payments are 
made on the earthquake.	
 It forecasts the gap will swell though to 4.6 percent of
GDP by March 2013 as the economy returns to normal growth,
increasing imports and investment earnings for foreigners.	
 The deficit hit a 21-year-low at 2.4 percent in the March
quarter, amid weak import demand, restrained earnings for
foreign investors, and one-off tax payments after several
Australian-based banks settled tax cases. It peaked at 9
percent of GDP in the first half of 2006.	
 Last month, Standard & Poor's cut its ratings outlook on
New
Zealand's foreign-currency credit ratings of AA+/A-1+ to
negative from stable, citing concerns about foreign debt.
[ID:nSGE6AL05L]	
 New Zealand relies heavily on foreign borrowing to fund its
deficits because of perennially low levels of household saving.
The government has said it wants to increase national savings.	
 ""We expect no reaction from the ratings agencies,"" said
Deutsche Bank chief economist Darren Gibbs. ""They will
continue to look for evidence pointing to a sustained
improvement in national savings performance as the economy
returns to trend.""	
 Fitch Ratings, which cut its AA-plus outlook to negative in
July, has said the country needs sustainable improvement in its
fiscal position and foreign debt levels to secure an upgrade.	
 The central bank has warned the country needs to cut its
high debt or face punishment by markets with higher lending
rates and the risk that its debt servicing costs may become
intolerable.	
 New Zealand's net foreign liabilities edged lower to 85.2
percent of GDP from 86.3 percent in the previous quarter. By
comparison Australia's level is around 60 percent.	
 The housing market has also cooled and banks have tightened
lending conditions, which has seen demand for finance ease.

 By Tomasz Janowski	
 SINGAPORE, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The euro clawed back some of
its losses against major currencies on Wednesday, but signs
that the euro zone's debt crisis is far from abating are set
to keep the single currency on the defensive.	
 Asian stock markets clung to Tuesday's gains in light
pre-holiday trade after upbeat earnings forecasts and a flurry
of merger activity lifted European and Wall Street stocks,
pushing U.S. shares to more than two-year highs.	
 The euro hit record lows in early Asian trade against
safe-haven Swiss franc and high-yielding Australian
dollar and traded near a three-week low against the
dollar after warnings Portugal and Greece faced more ratings
cuts.[ID:nLDE6BK0HE]	
But thin liquidity and talk of bids from Asian central
banks lent it some support. A report that Beijing has pledged
further ""concerted action"" to help Europe stabilise its
financial system [ID:nLDE6BL007] also seemed to have offered
some players an excuse to trim short euro positions.	
 According to the FT, the officials, who declined to be
named, said Vice Premier Wang Qishan had given assurances that
China would step up support for European stabilisation efforts
""if necessary.""	
 The euro edged up 0.2 percent against the dollar on the
day to $1.3124 , but Credit Suisse technical analysts
said in a note the euro needed to clear $1.3250 to avoid being
pushed down below $1.30 this week.	
 Analysts expect the euro to remain under pressure from a
steady drip of grim ratings news. Many argue that markets were
already pricing even more gloom for the euro zone's weaker
members -- Greece, Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Belgium -- and
that ratings agencies were merely playing catch-up.	
 The prospect of huge debts amassed during the global
financial crisis plaguing European governments for years to
come also weighed on the British currency with sterling near
three-month lows after news or a record borrowing requirement.	
 However the gloom was not universal and stock markets
managed to squeeze out small gains, supported by expectations
of an upward revision in U.S. third quarter gross domestic
product, due at 1330 GMT. 
 Shares in Tokyo initially crawled to another
seven-month high after Tuesday's 1.5 percent jump, but lost
some ground in the afternoon session to close 0.2 percent lower.	
 Markets elsewhere in Asia-Pacific were
barely changed.	
 ""In the currency and European bond markets risk aversion
is prevailing. But in many other markets we've seen
risk-taking,"" said Tohru Sasaki, chief strategist at JPMorgan
Chase Bank in Tokyo.	
 Hong Kong shares were up 0.6 percent at 0600 GMT
with refiners and energy stocks such as Sinopec
among top gainers thanks to high crude and fuel prices. 
 News of a surprising drop in U.S. crude inventories and a
cold snap in the United States and Europe briefly drove U.S.
oil prices  above $90 per barrel -- a level it has
reached only twice in the past two years. Trading in February
futures eventually settled just below the $90 mark, up 11
cents on the day.	
 Gold , which benefits from bouts of investor angst
as a result of its safe-haven status, was up about $5 an ounce
on the day at around $1,390 in thin trade, supported by euro
zone debt worries, but well below a historical high of around
$1,430 hit earlier this month.

(Adds details, economist's quote, graphic)
 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Japan's export growth picked up in
November for the first time in nine months due chiefly to the
yen's pullback from 15-year highs, but analysts say signs of
softening overseas demand cloud the outlook.
 Uncertainties about overseas economies bode ill for the
Japanese government, whose fiscal policy options are limited due
to a self-imposed cap on new borrowing for the year starting next
April. The government is set to compile the 2011/12 budget this
week.
 Economists expect export growth to resume slowing towards the
first quarter of next year but to regain strength later on demand
from emerging economies.
 This outlook is not assured, however, given a weak U.S. job
market, Europe's debt problems and China's policy tightening
aimed at staving off potential asset price bubbles.
 ""As the global economy is clearly slowing, although it is not
deteriorating, Japan's annual export growth may turn flat in
January-March, which will weigh on the economy's growth,"" said
Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute
in Tokyo.
 ""But even if the Japanese economy's slowdown and downside
risks become more evident early next year, the government could
hardly do anything about it, with little room left to boost
fiscal spending.""
 UNCERTAINTIES OVERSEAS
 Exports rose 9.1 percent in the year to November, less than
economists' median forecast for a 10.0 percent rise. Imports
increased 14.2 percent from a year earlier against an expected
annual rise of 9.0 percent.
 Exports to China, the biggest destination for Japanese goods,
rose 18.3 percent in November from a year earlier, faster than a
17.6 percent annual rise in October.
 Shipments to Asia rose an annual 13.0 percent in November,
also faster than an 11.3 percent annual rise in the previous
month.
 Exports to the United States slowed to 1.2 percent annual
growth in November from 4.7 percent in the year to October.
 Uncertainties about overseas economies bode ill for the
Japanese government, which is struggling to keep a self-imposed
cap on new borrowing for the year starting next April even as
welfare costs rise.
 Japan's economy is expected to have contracted in the fourth
quarter as soft exports and an expiry of government stimulus
dented factory output.
 The Bank of Japan eased its policy further in October by
pledging to keep rates virtually at zero until an end of
deflation was in sight and launching a 5 trillion yen ($60
billion) scheme for buying government bonds and corporate debt.
It kept the policy unchanged at a rate review on Tuesday.
 The trade balance came to a surplus of 162.8 billion yen,
down 55.4 percent from a year earlier. That compared with the
median forecast for a 450.0 billion yen surplus.

 By Robert Gibbons
 NEW YORK, Dec 21 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices climbed back
above $90 for only the second time in two years on Tuesday, led
by unseasonal gains in gasoline as New York supplies tighten
and on chilly weather that has helped stimulate demand.
 Prices got a late lift from American Petroleum Institute
data showing a large 5.8 million barrel decline in weekly crude
stocks, closing the gap with official U.S. Department of Energy
data that last week showed the biggest drop in 8 years.
 The API also reported an unexpected 2.9 million barrel fall
in gasoline supplies, supporting prices that have rallied on a
series of eastern seaboard refinery outages, lifting the
gasoline crack spread to near its highest since summer.[API/S]
 U.S. crude for February delivery  rose 45 cents to
settle at $89.82 a barrel. Prices rose further to trade at
$90.03 in after-hours activity following the API figures, just
shy of the 26-month high $90.76 hit on Dec. 7.
 ICE Brent crude for February  rose 46 cents to
settle at $93.20 a barrel, having moved as high as $93.43,
highest intraday since reaching $97.03 on Oct, 2, 2008.
 ""Cold weather supports heating oil and gasoline is still
backwardated and supported by the Hovensa outage and lack of
significant imports,"" said Tom Bentz, broker at BNP Paribas
Commodity Futures Inc in New York.
 An additional snapshot of U.S. inventories will come from
the Energy Information Administration at 10:30 a.m. EST (1530
GMT) on Wednesday, expected to show a further 2.3 million
barrels decline in crude stocks but a 1.4 million barrel rise
in gasoline, according to a Reuters survey of analysts. [EIA/S]
 Stocks of distillates, which include heating oil, were
estimated to be down 700,000 barrels.
 Short-term fundamentals trumped the dollar, whose influence
on oil has waned as evidence mounts that the vast surplus of
inventories built up after the 2008 crisis are thinning, and as
trading volumes thin into the year-end.
 The dollar gained on the euro on Tuesday as ratings agency
Moody's warning it may downgrade debt-ridden Portugal's rating
prompted euro selling. [FRX/]
 REFINED FUELS USE EXPECTED TO RISE
 Expectations that driving demand over Christmas and new
year holidays would boost U.S. consumption helped lift U.S.
gasoline futures  2.07 cents to settle at $2.3985 a
gallon, highest settlement since closing at $2.4351 on May 3.
 Gasoline prices have been supported by the continued
closure of a major gasoline-making unit at the Hovensa LLC
refinery in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, and a shut
arbitrage window for gasoline shipments from Europe.
[ID:nN20128274] [ID:nNN2020364]
 Cold weather has driven up heating fuel demand in northern
Europe and the United States. U.S. heating oil demand was
expected to average 4.6 percent above normal. [ID:nSGE6BJ05E]
 Harsh winter weather in China, the world's second-biggest
oil consumer after the United States, has also stoked demand.
 Kerosene imports for November hit an all-time high of
861,388 tonnes, up nearly 61 percent a year ago, official
customs data showed on Tuesday. [ID:nBJL002117]
 Although MasterCard data showed that U.S. retail gasoline
demand last week was down 4 percent from a year ago, even
thinner stockpiles will lend support. [ID:nN21261134]
 ""The (API) decline in gasoline stocks is notable,
especially with the average (retail) price approaching $3.00
per gallon. This should be enough to produce $90 per barrel and
higher for crude,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again

 NEW YORK, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on Tuesday
on upbeat corporate results and mergers amid bets of stronger
global growth next year, while the euro fell on worries of more
ratings downgrades for indebted euro zone countries.
 Cold weather in Europe and the United States kept oil
prices firm for the third straight session, while copper hit an
all-time high, buoyed by supply disruption from Chile.
 U.S. government bonds rose as some investors viewed current
prices as attractive. Treasuries also benefited from demand for
safe-haven assets amid fears of further debt problems among
euro zone countries.
 U.S. stock indexes hit new highs after topping key
technical resistance levels. The S&P 500 has rallied 6.1
percent to two-year highs this month and was up around 22.5
percent from closing lows this year.
 Analysts said equity markets were also lifted as fund

 Meanwhile, the euro fell against the dollar as worries of
more credit ratings downgrades for indebted European countries
prompted traders to lighten up on the currency ahead of year
end.
 The most recent tremor came as Fitch Ratings said it could
cut Greece's foreign currency rating. Earlier Moody's Investors
Service warned it may cut debt-ridden Portugal's A1 rating by
one or two notches after a review, citing weak growth prospects
and high borrowing costs.
 ""The euro's inability to sustain any rebound is a clear
sign that the path of least resistance right now is downward,""
said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster,
New Jersey. ""If it weren't for the thin market conditions, we'd

 The euro  fell 0.21 percent to $1.3088 after trading

 Analysts said sentiment remained bearish on fears the debt

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Dec 21 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar on Tuesday in thin, pre-holiday trade as worries of more
ratings downgrades for indebted euro zone countries prompted
traders to lighten up on the currency ahead of year end.
 The latest lurch lower came as Fitch Ratings said it could
cut Greece's foreign currency rating, wiping out overnight
gains after supportive comments from China.
 Analysts said they expect the euro to continue a slide
toward $1.30 in the coming days.
 ""The euro's inability to sustain any rebound is a clear
sign that the path of least resistance right now is downward,""
said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster,
New Jersey. ""If it weren't for the thin market conditions, we'd
probably be testing the $1.30 level more forcefully.""
 The euro was last at $1.3083 , down 0.3 percent and
off a session peak above $1.32. Its reversal in New York took
it below its 200-day moving average -- $1.3097, according to
Reuters data, for the second straight day, though it managed to
climb back above that level on Monday.
 A sustained move below the $1.3097 level would be a bearish
sign. Dolan said a near-term short-squeeze was possible but
said it would take a rebound above $1.3250, an important
trendline from the euro's recent $1.35 high, to signal a
reversal of trend.
 A significant decline below $1.30 appeared unlikely,
traders said, as investors close out positions for the year.
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 83.88 yen  but fell
0.5 percent to 0.9606 Swiss francs .
 EURO CONTAGION FEARS PERSIST
 Earlier, China Vice Premier Wang Qishan said Beijing, which
has invested an undisclosed portion of its $2.65 trillion
reserves in the euro, had played its part to ease Europe's
plight and held out hope that a turning point was near. The
comments helped the euro push above $1.32. For details, see
[ID:nTOE6BK01Q]
 But the euro pared gains after Moody's warned it may
downgrade debt-ridden Portugal's A1 rating by one or two
notches after a review that will take up to three months. That
reinforced worries the debt crisis would persist well into
2011. [ID:nLDE6BK0HV]
 ""In the bigger picture of things, there's no clarity from
European policymakers with regards to the contagion fears in
Europe and we can expect this to weigh on the euro for the
remainder of the year,"" said Dean Popplewell, chief strategist
of FX brokerage OANDA in Toronto.
 Analysts said fears persist that the debt crisis that has
engulfed Greece and Ireland could put Portugal and Spain under
more pressure early next year.
 Spain sold 3.88 billion euros in treasury bills relatively
easily Tuesday in its last funding exercise of the year, but
analysts said worries about the ability of indebted euro zone
countries to service their debt will persist. [ID:nEAP000941]
 The euro fell to a lifetime low of 1.2547 Swiss francs
 on EBS as euro zone concerns enhanced the
safe-haven status of the franc.
 ""Many investors are using euro/Swiss as a gauge for the
concerns about the problems in the euro zone periphery.
Sovereign risk is still weighing on the euro into year-end,""
said Valentin Marinov, currency strategist at CitiFX.
 ""At some point the (Swiss National Bank) may have to resort
to more decisive measures to counter any further decline in
euro/Swiss. But we may have to see further deterioration in the
Swiss fundamentals before this can happen,"" Marinov said.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Dec 21 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar on Tuesday after supportive comments from China spurred
a bout of short-covering, but the gains were likely to be
short-lived amid fears of more ratings downgrades of indebted
euro zone economies.
 Analysts still expect the euro to gradually slide toward
$1.30 in the coming days. A significant decline below that
level appeared unlikely, they added, as liquidity thins and
traders close out positions ahead of year-end.
 China's Vice Premier Wang Qishan said Beijing, which has
invested an undisclosed portion of its $2.65 trillion reserves
in the euro, had played its part to ease Europe's plight and
held out hope that a turning point was near. The comments
helped the euro push above $1.32 and regain its 200-day moving
average. For details, see [ID:nTOE6BK01Q]
 But the euro pared gains after Moody's warned it may
downgrade debt-ridden Portugal's A1 rating by one or two
notches after a review that will take up to three months,
reinforcing worries the debt crisis would persist well into
2011. [ID:nLDE6BK0HV]
 ""Near term, the euro will remain under pressure. There is
certainly good interest to want to sell euros on any rallies,""
said Dean Popplewell, chief strategist of FX brokerage OANDA in
Toronto.
 ""In the bigger picture of things, there's no clarity from
European policymakers with regards to the contagion fears in
Europe and we can expect this to weigh on the euro for the
remainder of the year,"" he added.
 The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.3140, rebounding from
Monday's trough of $1.3094, its lowest since Dec. 2. It earlier
hit as high as $1.3202  on trading platform EBS.
 The euro has managed to crawl back above its 200-day moving
average, now at $1.3098 on EBS, after breaking below it on
Monday. But analysts said sentiment remained bearish on fears
the debt crisis that has engulfed Greece and Ireland could put
Portugal and Spain under more pressure early next year.
 Spain sold 3.88 billion euros in treasury bills relatively
easily Tuesday in its last funding exercise of the year, but
analysts said worries about the ability of indebted euro zone
countries to service their debt will persist. [ID:nEAP000941]
 ""It seems clear that from January, the debt problems will
still be very much there. These countries need to raise a lot
of money early next year,"" said Beat Siegenthaler, currency
analyst at UBS in Zurich.
 The single currency fell to a fresh lifetime low of 1.2560
Swiss francs  on EBS as euro zone concerns enhanced
the safe-haven status of the franc.
 ""Many investors are using euro/Swiss as a gauge for the
concerns about the problems in the euro zone periphery.
Sovereign risk is still weighing on the euro into year-end,""
said Valentin Marinov, currency strategist at CitiFX.
 ""At some point the (Swiss National Bank) may have to resort
to more decisive measures to counter any further decline in
euro/Swiss. But we may have to see further deterioration in the
Swiss fundamentals before this can happen,"" Marinov said.
 The dollar was down 0.1 percent at 83.69 yen ,
with strong support seen around 82.80 yen, its low from last
week. The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady on Tuesday,
as expected. [ID:nTKZ006700]
 The Australian dollar was up 0.5 percent versus the U.S.
dollar at $0.9977 , helped by an increase in risk
appetite as stocks advanced and tensions on the Korean

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Dec 21 (Reuters) - The euro pared gains on
Tuesday after Moody's put Portugal on review for a possible
downgrade, while U.S. stocks rose on upbeat corporate results
and mergers as investors bet on stronger global growth next
year.
 Cold weather in Europe and the United States kept oil
prices firm for the third straight session, while copper hit an
all-time high, buoyed by supply disruption from Chile.
 U.S. government bond prices rose as traders positioned for
Federal Reserve bond purchases. Treasuries, as well as gold,
also were bought as a haven from risk amid fears of further
borrowing strains in Europe.
 Moody's Investors Service warned it may cut debt-ridden
Portugal's A1 rating by one or two notches after a review,
citing weak growth prospects and high borrowing costs.
 That followed its move last week to cut Ireland's credit
rating by five notches to Baa1, the third last investment grade
rank, and put Spain's rating on review for a possible cut.
 ""The Moody's announcement on Portugal has knocked some of
today's optimism out of the euro but these credit announcements
are not completely out of the blue any more so the negative
reaction is always going to be a little bit more dampened than
six months ago,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency analyst at
Rabobank.
 ""I don't think this announcement on its own will be capable
of knocking euro/dollar out of its range,"" she said.
 The euro  rose 0.14 percent to $1.3138 after trading
as high as $1.3200 earlier in the session, boosted by a
short-covering rally in Asian trade.
 The euro fell to a fresh all-time low against the Swiss
franc , at 1.2615 francs as euro zone concerns
enhanced the safe-haven status of the franc.
 Analysts said sentiment remained bearish on fears the debt
crisis that has engulfed Greece and Ireland could put Portugal
and Spain under more pressure early next year.

easily Tuesday in its last funding of the year, but analysts
said worries about whether some euro zone countries can service
their debt will likely persist into 2011. [ID:nEAP000941]
 The dollar fell 0.16 percent against a basket of major
currencies.
 Meanwhile, U.S. stocks rose as earnings and mergers
supported a rise in the equity market with the S&P 500 rallying
to a two-year high, up 21 percent from its lows this year.
 Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co
in San Francisco, said fund managers are reallocating money to
equities from fixed income investments and reducing cash
positions in anticipation of fresh money coming into equities
next month.
 ""You get to this point toward the end of the year and
performance and positioning are very key to fund managers,"" he
said.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 33.15
points, or 0.29 percent, at 11,510.98. The Standard & Poor's

 U.S. Treasury prices rose as investors awaited the Federal

 By Sakari Suoninen
 FRANKFURT, Dec 21 (Reuters) - The world's major central
banks said on Tuesday they would extend emergency supplies of
U.S. dollar funding to money markets, in a sign that authorities
remain concerned about financial instability as governments
grapple with debt problems.
 The European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, Bank of
Canada, the Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank extended
their U.S. dollar liquidity providing operations with the U.S.
Federal Reserve until Aug. 1, an indication they view the money
markets as still fragile.
 The swap lines, which had been due to expire next month,
were established to ease strains in short-term money markets by
ensuring banks do not have trouble obtaining dollars, although
banks have used the lines relatively little since the middle of
this year.
 The Fed's policy-setting panel opened swap lines, first with
the ECB and the SNB in December 2007 and later with other
central banks, including those of Sweden, Mexico and Brazil.
 These lines were discontinued in January this year because
market conditions had improved, but in May the central banks
decided to reopen the operations after the sovereign debt crisis
ignited. Now they have been extended again.
 ""They are designed to improve liquidity conditions in global
money markets and to minimize the risk that strains abroad could
spread to U.S. markets,"" the Fed said in a statement.
 Analysts said that the move, which met their expectations,
showed central banks cannot yet step down from the larger role
they have assumed to stave off the financial crisis.
 ""In a structurally fragile and interrelated global financial
system, the running risk of unforeseen shocks elevates central
banks' lender of last resort function to a systemically
indispensable role,"" Tullett Prebon economist Lena Komileva
said.
 
 LOW DEMAND
 The total use of the lines peaked at more than $580 billion
in December 2008. Demand for Fed dollar swaps was high right
after their reintroduction in May, with $9.2 billion scooped up
on May 12, all through the ECB. However, since early June demand
has been muted.
 Last week the Fed said the only use for the swap line
between it and the other central banks came from the ECB and
amounted to $60 million, with an interest rate of 1.18 percent.
It added it would continue to publish swap activity weekly.
 The SNB has had no demand in its dollar repos since the May
resumption. 
 Traders said the low demand was mainly due to the high rates
that central banks charge, but viewed such a facility as useful.
 ""The price is very high, but the facility is there and in
situations where there are strains, everybody can use it as a
backstop,"" the trader said.
 ""In normal circumstances, you won't use that, but there
could be a situation where lots of people need it.""
 The Bank of Canada said it did not need to use the facility
at present, but it was prudent to maintain the agreement.
 ""This shows that central banks are doing everything possible
to prevent tension from reappearing,"" RBS economist Jacques
Cailloux said. ""The situation remains fragile, so this is part
of the prevention toolkit.""
 The swap lines are conducted on a full allotment basis with
all the central banks participating, except for Bank of Canada,
which has a maximum of $30 billion.
 Many foreign banks and investors had depended on money
markets to borrow dollars to cheaply fund their
dollar-denominated longer-term investments.
 After the collapse of Lehman Brothers, they found themselves
scrambling for dollars to fund these obligations, driving up the
dollar against local currencies and raising the spectre of
widespread defaults.
 In the currency swaps, the U.S. Fed offered dollars to
foreign central banks in exchange for their currencies. The
foreign central banks then lent the dollars to banks in their
domestic markets, enabling firms to access dollars at a time
when normal financing channels had shut down.

 NEW YORK, Dec 21 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Tuesday after
China urged that tough talk from European leaders on the debt
crisis be backed up with action, but the gains were likely to

 ""There's a possibility that it pushes lower towards the
$1.30 level, probably no lower than that,"" he said.
 In early New York trading, the euro rose 0.3 percent at

1480,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2010 10:00AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Political risks to watch in Western Europe in 2011," By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent
 LONDON, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Western Europe faces one of its
most challenging years in recent memory in 2011, with pushing
through painful austerity measures in the teeth of unrest and
likely divisions on handling the euro zone debt crisis.
 Below are the key risks to watch in the region.
 
 TROUBLED EURO ZONE FRINGE
 While almost all western European countries are under some
market pressure to rein in deficits, the fringe economies dubbed
the PIIGS -- Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain --
remain most in focus.
 For Ireland and Greece -- forced to seek a bailout from the
IMF and European Union -- the key question will be whether the
tough associated austerity measures prove politically
sustainable.
 For the others, the question is whether by cutting spending
and controlling banking problems they will be able to persuade
markets they can do without a bailout. For Europe's richer
central core nations, the debate remains how much support is
genuinely available and what strings are attached.
 Whether sparked by unrest or other political issues,
political wobbles will likely not only push borrowing costs
higher but could ripple into wider European or even global
markets.
 What to watch:
 -- Whether bond markets and credit ratings agencies keep up
the pressure on euro zone fringe states will have much wider
social, political and market implications. So far, market
pressure has tended to return even to countries that had been
seen to have tackled the crisis, such as Ireland. There have
already been signs of investors turning on Belgium. Do other
countries come into focus?
 -- Does the political consensus around austerity in the
PIIGS begin to break down? Do other euro zone countries and
Britain continue to push forward with spending cuts or do they
move back towards stimulus mode to avoid renewed recession?
 FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES
 European policymakers are increasingly upfront that the bloc
faces fundamental questions over its future that go well beyond
short-term problems with Greece, Ireland or elsewhere.
 European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso told EU
leaders at a meeting in December problems were ""systemic"", while
the IMF has said the EU's current country-by-country crisis
response measures were inadequate.
 At a two-day summit, leaders agreed a change to the EU
treaty to create a permanent financial safety net from 2013,
although market concerns remained over whether the bloc had
enough immediate funds to aid troubled countries.
 In the longer run, some analysts say the bloc must either
move towards a broader fiscal union or risk fracturing
altogether. Some leaders including Italy's Silvio Berlusconi
back the idea of common euro zone bonds -- something Germany's
Angela Merkel vehemently opposes.
 What to watch:
 -- If other countries such as Portugal or Spain need bailing
out next year, is there sufficient money or does the euro zone
needs to put together another crisis fund? Does pressure grow to
make private bondholders take serious ""haircuts"" through
restructuring debt?
 -- Does pressure grow for euro zone bonds despite German
opposition?
 SOCIAL UNREST
 Almost all European countries have seen an increase in
strikes, street protests and unrest in the financial crisis --
and it looks set to get worse in 2011. But so far, while
demonstrations have won occasional small concessions, they have
largely failed to impact wider policy.
 Greece, which has seen widespread rioting on several
occasions, including demonstrations in May in which three people
died in a burning bank, is seen most at risk.
 Britain saw its worst rioting in two decades in December
over proposed student fee rises, with more expected next year as
spending cuts begin to bite. However, to date, the coalition
government has not changed course.
 In contrast, Ireland has seen mass street demonstrations but
almost no violence despite some of the toughest cuts in Europe
-- widely seen as a sign that, as in many emerging European
economies, society has largely accepted austerity.
 France saw major demonstrations against proposed pension
reform, and could see more in the run-up to elections in 2012,
although the government pushed through its pension changes
despite the protests.
 Italian rioters fought running battles with police in the
streets after Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi won a
no-confidence vote, while Spain declared a ""state of alert"" to
force air traffic controllers in a wildcat strike back to work.
 What to watch:
 -- Do protests come together into a wider European
anti-austerity movement or remain fragmented, largely the
preserve of individual interest groups? In Britain, do students
become a core part of a wider protest cause or disappear
politically now the fees vote is passed?
 -- Signs in any country that social protest has forced the
reversal of austerity policy might give heart to demonstrators
elsewhere but could concern markets.
 -- Unions will likely be more focused on ousting the
centre-right government such as those in Britain, France or
Italy rather than left of centre governments in Greece, Portugal
or Spain.
 ELECTIONS, GOVERNMENT TENSIONS
 Forcing through such painful austerity measures would test
even the most resilient government, and many of Europe's are
dealing with mounting domestic political problems of their own
as well as looming elections that will affect policy-making.
 The political temperature in France looks set to rise ahead
of its 2012 presidential poll, in which President Nicolas
Sarkozy will face a Socialist challenger that could be the
current IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn.
 That, together with the rising risk of unrest, looks likely
to deter Sarkozy from further reforms.
 Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero could
struggle to make it as far as scheduled polls in 2012 if he
loses the support of key minority parties such as The Basque
Nationalist Party.
 Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi survived the latest
no-confidence vote in December, but many analysts believe he
will face the electorate next year after losing the support of
key allies.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel will be closely watching
local elections, keen to avoid losing further power.
 Portugal's Socialist minority government is seen constrained
by its need to keep other parties onside. In contrast, Greece's
Socialists seem relatively well ensconced in power despite
protests.
 Britain's Liberal Democrat-Conservative coalition -- its
first in decades -- is seen as relatively likely to survive,
with junior partner the Liberal Democrats now so unpopular they
have too much to lose to trigger elections.
 What to watch:
 -- Ireland is seen almost inevitably facing a change of
government when elections take place early next year. But will
the opposition Fine Gael party stick with the current austerity
plans?
 -- Any new signs of coalition strains in Britain or
elsewhere might spook markets.
 OUTSIDE RISKS
 While Europe's own political problems look set to preoccupy
many in its markets, European investors also face a host of
outside political risks during 2011.
 While the risk of a debt crisis in emerging Europe affecting
richer European countries looks much lower than it did a year
ago, analysts warn rising geopolitical tensions between China
and the United States over currency and other issues could hit
the wider global economy.
 Conflict in the Middle East around Iran's nuclear programme
or on the Korean peninsula would likely also have a knock-on
effect on European markets, while overseas European firms face
mounting competition from rivals from emerging economies.
 What to watch:
 -- Are any military clashes in the Middle East or Korea
limited in nature or sustained? Markets might be able to shrug
off limited action, but any long-term impact on oil supplies or
Asian growth would be much more serious.
 -- Is Europe dragged into a wider currency stand-off between
the United States and emerging economies? So far, European
policymakers have kept largely to one side and the euro has
tended to be a beneficiary of dollar weakness.

1481,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2010 10:00AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Key 2011 political risks in emerging Europe," By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent
 LONDON, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Euro zone debt worries, the
survival of IMF deals in Eastern Europe, elections, protests,
leadership dynamics in Russia and internal divisions in Turkey
could all affect emerging European investors in 2011.
 Below are the key political risks to watch.
 WESTERN EUROPE'S WOES
 For many investors in emerging Europe, the key political
risks are not from within the region at all but from the more
established economies of Western Europe as they struggle to
contain the euro zone debt crisis.
 The key issues will be whether the euro zone's most troubled
states -- particularly Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Italy and
Spain -- can make tough spending cuts and placate bond markets
and whether the bloc can make wider reforms.
 If Western Europe does sink back towards recession, a
knock-on effect on exports from emerging Europe could have a
marked impact on economies and assets.
 In a two-day summit in December, EU states agreed to create
a crisis fund from 2013 -- but some market players still worry
there may not be enough money to bail out countries such as
Spain or Portugal if they need it in the coming year.
 What to watch:
 -- any renewed crisis in Greece, Ireland or elsewhere will
likely have a knock-on market impact in the emerging EU,
possibly again raising worries over the most troubled states
such as Hungary.
 -- Any broader reform of EU treaties, bailout regimes or
bond haircuts will have a particular impact on accession states
such as Poland, the Czech Republic and the Baltics.
 IMF, AUSTERITY AND ""UNCONVENTIONAL MEASURES""
 Emerging European countries were amongst the first hit by
the financial crisis in 2008, forcing many to turn to the
International Monetary Fund and EU for bailouts that often
brought with them harsh austerity measures.
 While some countries -- such as Latvia -- earned plaudits
from Brussels and the IMF for taking the harsh medicine,
Hungary's new Fidesz government is walking a more unconventional
path prompting the collapse of its deal. That has disturbed
investors who worry the pattern might be repeated elsewhere in
the region.
 Hungary says it must regain its financial independence. It
has not yet released full details of its structural reforms.
Fiscal measures so far have included special taxes on banks and
some corporate sectors and what pension funds described as an
effective renationalisation of mandatory private pension
schemes. 
 The government is also poised to change the central bank
law, aiming to pack the Monetary Council with its own candidates
next March when the mandates of four out of seven members
expire.
 Other countries such as Romania are continuing to push
forward with their IMF deals -- although like their counterparts
in Western Europe they face an almost inevitable uptick in
strikes, protests and other civil unrest as well as mounting
strains within governments.
 What to watch:
 -- Action by ratings agencies against Hungary or further
""unconventional measures"" by the government there could unsettle
markets across the wider region. Any perceived movement back
towards the IMF consensus would be taken well.
 -- The failure of another IMF deal could hit markets across
the region.
 ELECTIONS AND PROTESTS
 Latvia's ruling coalition performed relatively well in
elections earlier this year, proving that austerities might not
always prove electorally toxic. But in other emerging EU
countries, the pressure of spending cuts is pressuring
coalitions sometimes to the brink of destruction.
 Romania's government narrowly survived no-confidence votes
this year over planned cuts, with political uncertainty
repeatedly knocking asset prices.
 In the Czech Republic, ties between the three coalition
parties have been strained after all three did badly in upper
house elections. Further tensions between the parties could
undermine investor confidence and make budget approval, pension
and health reforms even more difficult.
 In Hungary, Fidesz has a two-thirds majority together with
its Christian Democrat allies and has used that clout widely,
stripping the Constitutional Court of its jurisdiction over
matters related to state finances.
 Some analysts describe it as an attack on democratic checks
and balances but the government looks set to push ahead with
plans for a new constitution next year.
 What to watch:
 -- Signs of coalition strains in any emerging European
country with an IMF programme would almost certainly worry
markets. Romania probably looks most in focus, with centrist
Prime Minister Emil Boc likely facing repeated bids to topple
him and spark a full-blown political crisis.
 -- As in Western Europe, particularly widespread protests
could also grab investor attention, especially if they were seen
blocking or reversing reforms outright.
 RUSSIA -- OIL AND LEADERSHIP
 In Russia, all eyes will be on the leadership dynamic
between Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and President Dmitry
Medvedev in the run-up to the presidential elections in 2012 in
which both could potentially stand.
 Putin is by far the dominant member of what Russian
officials call the ruling ""tandem"" -- with leaked US diplomatic
cables from WikiLeaks describing the younger, shorter Medvedev
as ""Robin"" to Putin's ""Batman"".
 Most analysts and diplomats expect Putin to return to the
Kremlin in 2012 and believe Russia will be stable while he is in
control, although in the longer term some investors have worries
over such reliance on an individual.
 Putin himself says he and Medvedev will make a decision
closer to 2012 as to who is to stand. Some clarity could emerge
after the 2011 parliamentary elections.
 The world's biggest energy producer, Russia is heavily
reliant on oil and gas exports and any sustained fall in the
price of benchmark Urals crude below the budgeted average of $75
per barrel would hit hard, and potentially undermine Putin. But
prices moving higher could strengthen Moscow's hand and drive
heightened investor enthusiasm.
 What to watch:
 -- Clarity on presidential election plans, although a formal
statement is unlikely until closer to the time. Any real signs
of discord between Putin and Medvedev could provoke a
constitutional crisis and unnerve investors.
 -- Progress against corruption, described by Western
executives as the biggest barrier to business in Russia.
 TURKEY -- ELECTIONS AND TENSIONS
 Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan is widely tipped to
win a third consecutive term of single party rule in general
elections in June 2011, helped by strong economic growth but
with a religious/secular divide a potential flashpoint.
 Opponents of Erdogan's AK Party accuses it of having a
hidden long-term Islamic agenda, with long-running strains
between the government and secular military aggravated by a high
profile court cases against military officers accused of
plotting a coup.
 A debate over the use of religious headscarves -- a delicate
subject that cuts to the heart of national identity -- have also
resurfaced after the Higher Education Board ordered Istanbul
University to stop excluding students wearing them.
 Opponents of the headscarf ban say it is a violation of
individual freedom, while supporters say it is vital to Turkey's
secular principles.
 What to watch:
 -- Comments from the new armed forces chief General Isik
Kosaner as trials start over the so-called 2003 ""Sledgehammer""
plot to destabilise Erdogan and pave the way for military
intervention.
 -- Any government moves to ease the headscarf ban or
attempts to rewrite the constitution.
 -- Relations with the U.S. -- which have become increasingly
strained over Turkey's deteriorating relationship with Israel --
and the European Union, hobbled by wrangling over the divided
island of Cyprus.

1482,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2010 09:56AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Reuters top global political risk trends for 2011," LONDON, Dec 21 (Reuters) - China-U.S. rivalry, ageing
leaders, the chance of an Israeli attack on Iran and the
political fallout from 2010's euro zone crisis will top the
global political risks in 2011.
 Here are the key trends to watch in the coming year as
picked out by Reuters political and general news editor Sean
Maguire.
 1 -- WASHINGTON VERSUS BEIJING
 This is top of many people's lists and has been a ""global
risk"" for the last couple of years. But being familiar doesn't
disqualify it. Trade rows, competitive currency weakness,
gunboats on the South China seas, regional grandstanding,
economic rivalry and diplomatic divergence over North Korea and
Iran make the headlines, but the uneasy relationship between the
world's No. 1 and No. 2 economic powers drives numerous other
issues. The Economist says the pair have moved into an era of
""strategic mistrust"". Watch the body language of President Hu
Jintao's visit to the United States in January for a harbinger
of the tone for the year.
 2 -- THE COUNTRIES OF OLD MEN
 Watch for disturbances in countries with elderly rulers and
no visible succession plan. Egypt's Hosni Mubarak is 82 and has
had health problems. His son waits in the wings, but is no
certainty to succeed his father. The Saudi gerontocracy may be
tested by the death of King Abdullah, with concerns over how
foreign and oil policy might be affected by conservative
Interior Minister Prince Nayef winning the throne. What truth is
there in WikiLeak-ed reports that Iran's supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has terminal cancer and what impact would
his death have on bubbling internal power struggles? While
83-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej is revered by Thais, his son
does not have the same support in deeply divided Thailand. Will
we see a return of massive red-shirt protests and the kind of
bloody showdown that killed dozens in Bangkok in May?
 3 -- THE UNQUANTIFIABLE BUT UGLY
 What's the chance of an Israeli military strike against
Iran's nuclear facilities to slow Tehran's progress towards
atomic weapon capability? The only thing we can say is that it's
a probability of somewhere between zero and 100 percent. What
can be said with certainty is that the economic impact of
Israeli action would be enormous initially, which means this
risk can't be ignored. Nor can it really be measured,
unfortunately. What else should we worry about in the Middle
East? Currently it appears there is only a remote chance of a
return to violent Intifada due to the dead-end state of
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Elsewhere, Lebanon's Hezbollah
is not seen as wanting to strike the Israeli north, nor is
sectarian violence expected to resurrect itself in Iraq. Let's
hope both are true. Watch for Yemen, a failing state that has
involuntarily exported trouble across its land border to Saudi
Arabia and to the United States via airborne bombs.
 4 -- IT'S THE ECONOMY 
 Successful political management of Western economies is as
challenging as ever with growth uneven, debt levels high and
austerity the watchword. Politicians know it is hard to do the
right thing and still get elected. Watch for wavering in the
face of protest, and tactical moves on reforms that are
necessary but electorally costly. It's all a question of timing.
Britain's coalition government is playing a long game, knowing
it can impose painful cuts now and not face the public until
2015. Politicians in Ireland are not so lucky, but the Fine
Gael/Labour victors of next year's election will not
fundamentally be able to ease the budget pain. Italy will likely
drift into early elections with its deep-rooted debt problems
un-tackled. Spain, whose politicians are mindful a general
election must be held by March 2012, had to be cajoled into
budget cuts, labour law reforms and asset sales by markets
pushing its debt costs higher. Generally the timing does not
work for the euro zone's peripheral economies, which just can't
cut their spending and fire up tax-generating growth quickly
enough to climb out of their fiscal holes. While the threat of
sovereign default has eased, it is only political will in the
zone's larger countries, mainly Germany, which keeps the
periphery from insolvency. That makes for political uncertainty.
 5 -- CRISIS BACKLASH 
 Street violence is visible, noisy and alarming, but does it
change anything? There will be anti-austerity protests in Europe
but our best guess is that violence will be contained,
governments will not fall and fiscal reforms will haltingly
continue. Much of the developed world is facing up to a real
decline in living standards as the social contracts installed
after World War Two fray under the weight of unfulfillable
pension promises and national indebtedness. That makes for an
angrily discordant tone to political discourse, with
screechiness at its most ear-splitting in the United States,
where the Tea Party has assailed the political establishment.
The TPs lose their status as rebel outsiders in January when
those of them elected in the Republican victory in the mid-terms
take their seats in Congress. The tone might not change but the
practicalities of governing in cohabitation will make sullying
compromise inevitable.
 6 -- PRE-ELECTION POSTURING 
 Almost as distorting for policy-making as a looming election
is the prospect of one. Watch for gesture politics and jockeying
for position in France. Sarkozy has to resurrect his political
standing hurt by confrontations with unions over pension reform
if he is to win re-election in March 2012. Intriguingly the
biggest impact might be outside France. Sarkozy will be trying
to reform the global monetary system while at the helm of the
G20 presidency to win electoral credit at home. Will Washington
agree to a diminished role for the dollar in international
finance? U.S. President Barack Obama has to find a way to create
jobs and stimulate domestic demand, with a gridlocked Congress
and mounting concern over trillion dollar deficits and debt
mountains standing in his way. And he'll be starting his
campaign for re-election too. Most U.S. media attention will be
on the early rounds of the dogfight over the Republican
nomination. Russia, too, will be watching to see which of Putin
and Medvedev runs for the presidency in 2012. The assumption is
that the role is there for the taking for Putin, now prime
minister, should he decide to return to his old position but
watch for Kremlin intrigue revealing itself in unusual ways.
While not strictly within our definition, China is also
preparing for a leadership shift, with Xi Jinping set to succeed
Hu Jintao as president towards the end of 2012 or in early 2013.
To ensure the transition is smooth and happens against a stable
economic background, watch for measures to balance export-led
growth with domestic demand and a shift to a more market-based
currency regime. And no tolerance for dissent.
7 -- COUNTRY RISK
 Every country has its risks. At least the ones at home you
can gauge for yourself. But if a developed world investor wants
a decent return he or she must venture abroad. Is anywhere safe?
Try Turkey, where the ruling AKP under Prime Minister Tayyip
Erdogan will likely win a third term in an election that must
happen by July 2011 and the broad course of pro-growth reforms
should stay on track. Somewhere for the cautious to avoid --
Sudan, where the January referendum may break Africa's largest
country by land mass into two. It will be hard work to avoid
war, with devastating humanitarian consequences and an economic
cost of $100 billion to the wider region, according to
estimates. And here's one you can't avoid -- Nigeria goes to the
polls in April, and if levels of voter intimidation and ballot
stuffing reach the levels of previous elections, watch for
widespread unrest. If President Goodluck Jonathan's bid to hold
onto power is perceived to be unfairly thwarted, watch for a
return to violent militancy in the oil-producing Niger Delta
region. That would have an impact on oil supplies and
potentially the price you pay for petrol at the pump.
 8 -- THE BIG BANG
 North Korea looks the likeliest place to spark a major
regional crisis. Putting a percentage on its likelihood is again
impossible, but we can say it is more likely in 2011 than in
2010. With ruler Kim Jong-il appearing to bolster his son and
appointed successor Kim Jong-un's stature through
sabre-rattling, the potential for cross-border clashes with the
South has risen. Recent revelations of advanced uranium
enrichment facilities in the north have enhanced Pyongyang's
nuclear stature, boosting its bargaining power as it seeks to
stave off regime-ending economic collapse. Implosion in the
North is more likely than war. Both are possible. Either would
have vast economic and human consequences.
 9 -- THE LITTLE BANG
 Terrorism and the mutating threat from al Qaeda and its
sympathisers have not gone away in the last decade and need to
stay on the list of dangers. Attackers keep probing for weak
spots in security (the recent Yemen printer cartridge bombs, for
instance) and the continued large Western military presence in
Afghanistan feeds militant propaganda. While it is a lot harder
to launch a 9/11 spectacular, don't rule out a successful attack
on a civilian airliner at some point. Consequences of that would
again be unpredictable.
 10 -- BYTE-SIZED PROBLEMS
 The Stuxnet virus, WikiLeak revelations, subsequent
hack-backs on those who tried to shut it down, China-based
attacks on Google and the use of social media to ""out""
information that was legally locked down showed the power of
computer and Internet-based transmission mechanisms to disrupt
social and political norms in 2010. It doesn't amount to
cyber-warfare as some doom-sayers would have it, or the brave
new world of limitless information freedom that Internet zealots
promise. It does represent an assault on privacy as we used to
know it, a huge cost for business to protect itself and an
intriguing new element to black ops espionage. Plus a
redefinition of what it means to be friends with someone.

(Adds further company comment, background, latest shares)
 By Anna Ringstrom
 COPENHAGEN, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk
said on Tuesday it had signed a deal with Emisphere Technologies
to use the biotech firm's technology in the development of oral
versions of its insulins.
 There are no insulin tablets on the market and patients with
diabetes who need insulin -- a naturally occurring protein that
controls blood sugar -- must inject several times a day.
 Peter Kurtzhals, head of Novo's diabetes research, said it
would probably be 10 years before the company could start
marketing such pills, assuming the research is successful.
 ""We hope to see an expansion of the insulin market by making
oral insulin but it's too early to estimate what the market
potential is,"" he said.
 The world's biggest insulin maker said the new development
and licensing deal includes $57.5 million in potential product
development and sales milestone payments to Emisphere, including
$5 million on signing, as well as royalties from sales.
 Kurtzhals said he hoped to start Phase I studies with a
candidate oral form based on Emisphere technology within a year.
 Novo last year signed a similar deal with Irish firm Merrion
Pharmaceuticals. A potential oral insulin based on Merrion's
technology is already in clinical Phase I studies.
 ""What we access (in these deals) is technology that can
facilitate absorption of insulin or other proteins,"" Kurtzhals
said.
 
 HEDGING BETS
 Most people with diabetes would prefer to take insulin in
tablet form rather than injecting it.
 The challenge for drugmakers is to find a way to get insulin
through the stomach without it being destroyed or degraded
before it can affect blood sugar levels.
 Novo's decision to try another technology is a case of
hedging its bets, Kurtzhals said. ""It's not based on any data
from the ongoing Phase I trial.""
 He said Novo would receive data from that trial relatively
soon and publish it next year.
 Shares in Emisphere were 13 percent higher by 1500 GMT while
Novo was virtually unchanged, in line with the STOXX 600
European healthcare index.
 An inhalable insulin -- once seen as a potential bestseller
among needle-wary diabetics -- was dropped by Pfizer in 2007.
Soon after that, Novo and Eli Lilly abandoned similar plans for
an inhaled product.
 The World Health Organisation's website projects 366 million
people worldwide will have diabetes in 2030, against 220 million
in 2009.

1485,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2010 08:28AM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-Turkey cbank to use all tools to cap speculative flows," * No target for lira exchange rate level - cbank head
 * C.bank to take flexible approach in forex auctions
 * May change forex reserve requirement at some point
 * Inflation targets unchanged
 
(Adds governor and analysts quotes)
 By Ozge Ozbilgin
 ANKARA, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Turkey's central bank will deploy
its policy arsenal to fend off destabilising ""hot money"" flows
while encouraging long-term investors, its governor said on
Tuesday, leaving markets guessing on further interest rate cuts.
 The bank, in an abrupt policy switch last week, cut rates
and increased reserve requirements for banks' short term lira
deposits, to prevent the lira strengthening and curb credit
growth that has exacerbated a widening current account deficit.
 Addressing a news conference on monetary policy for 2011,
Governor Durmus Yilmaz said the bank did not have an exchange
rate target for the lira, while outlining a more flexible,
interventionist stance at weekly currency auctions according to
market circumstances.
 ""We may hold forex selling auctions if the forex market
loses depth. We may hold forex buying and selling auctions if
unfavourable levels emerge in the foreign exchange market,""
Yilmaz said.
 Reserve ratios for banks' foreign currency deposits, which
were left unchanged at 11 percent when lira deposit requirements
were raised, could be revised in the coming period.
 Many Turks hold foreign exchange deposits, a habit formed in
years gone by when high inflation made them wary of the lira.
 Turkey's unorthodox approach to stemming the inflow of
foreign funds, a problem common to fast growing emerging
markets, has spread unease within the investment community.
 The worry is that interest rate cuts may lead to overheating
if parallel measures to curb liquidity fail to work. The
International Monetary Fund warned on Friday that interest rates
may have to be increased if price pressures emerged.
 Yilmaz said the central bank foresaw excess liquidity
continuing in 2011, but at reasonable levels, adding several
policy tools will be used to calibrate monetary conditions.
 Turkey's benchmark bond, the Istanbul stockmarket and lira
were broadly flat after Yilmaz's comments, with investors little
further enlightened on the chances of more rate easing.
 ""I couldn't get a signal from Yilmaz's speech whether the
central bank will continue with rate cuts or not,"" said Guldem
Atabay, an economist at Ekspres Invest in Istanbul.
 
 EYES ON LIRA, FOREIGN INFLOWS
 The bank's moves have weakened the lira , now trading
at 5-month lows to the dollar of around 1.555 compared to
two-year highs of 1.38 in early November, though much of that
fall seems due to broader concerns over Europe's debt crisis.
 Yilmaz said capital inflows will be used more effectively to
strengthen foreign-exchange reserves.
 The bank will raise foreign-exchange purchases at its daily
auctions to $50 million from a current $40 million and it could
also hold auctions to sell foreign exchange if exchange rate
levels are deemed unhealthy, Yilmaz said.
 Turkey and many other emerging-market peers have introduced
measures to prevent domestic currencies strengthened by
portfolio inflows from harming exports.
 Turkey was not actively considering a Brazil-style Tobin
Tax, though it was sometimes necessary to penalise portfolio
investors, Yilmaz said.
 ""Penalties may be in order if and when necessary but we
consider 'hot money' flows from an economic perspective.""
 Turkey holds a general election in June, but Yilmaz denied
the central bank had been influenced by political pressures, and
said strategy was a response to global economic developments.
 Analysts see Turkey's economy growing 7.9 percent this year
but slowing to 4.5 percent expansion in 2011.
 The bank reaffirmed its inflation targets of 5.5 percent for
2011 and 5 for 2012. Inflation is seen at 5 percent in 2013.
 The target for this year was 6.5 pct. In November inflation
was running at 7.3 percent on the year.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Dec 21 (Reuters) - The euro pared gains against the
dollar in thin trade on Tuesday after ratings firm Moody's put
Portugal on review for a possible downgrade, reinforcing worries
that the euro zone's debt crisis would persist well into 2011.
 The single currency also fell to a fresh lifetime low versus
the Swiss franc as investor concerns over the euro zone
periphery enhanced the safe haven status of the franc. 
 Moody's said it may downgrade Portugal's A1 rating by one or
two notches after a review, citing concerns about the country's
weak growth prospects and high borrowing costs, in the latest
ratings-related jolt to a euro zone member. [ID:nLDE6BK0HE]
 ""The Moody's announcement on Portugal has knocked some of
today's optimism out of the euro but these credit announcements
are not completely out of the blue any more so the negative
reaction is always going to be a little bit more dampened than
six months ago,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency analyst at
Rabobank.
 ""I don't think this announcement on its own will be capable
of knocking euro/dollar out of its range,"" she said.
 Comments from a Chinese vice premier that China supports
European Union efforts to calm global markets in the wake of
Europe's debt crisis were enough to trigger a short-covering
rally in holiday-thinned trade in Asia. [ID:nTOE6BK01Q]
 ""The comments show the euro failing is not acceptable for
the Chinese,"" said Pierre Lequeux, head of currency management
at Aviva Investors. ""Supporting the euro is aimed at gaining
more political leverage when negotiating with the United
States,"" he added.
 But Beijing's challenge to the EU to deal swiftly with its
debt problems also highlighted the extent of concern over the
still expanding crisis. 
 The euro fell around 45 pips on the announcement before
steadying at $1.3150 , still up around 0.2 percent on the
day. It made a brief show above $1.3200 in the Asian session,
extending its rebound from Monday's trough of $1.3094, its
lowest since Dec. 2.
 In a positive sign, the currency has managed to crawl back
above its 200-day moving average, now at $1.3102.
 Many market players think pressure will remain on the euro
as a number of investors fret that the debt crisis that has
already engulfed Greece and Ireland could put Portugal and Spain
under more pressure early next year.
 Spain sold 3.88 billion euros in treasury bills relatively
easily on Tuesday, in its last funding exercise of the year, but
euro zone debt worries are likely to persist into 2011.
[ID:nEAP000941]
 ""It seems clear that from January the debt problems will
still be very much there. These countries need to raise a lot of
money early next year,"" said Beat Siegenthaler, currency analyst
at UBS in Zurich.
 
 EURO/SWISS RECORD LOW
 The euro slid to a record low against the Swiss franc of
1.2615 francs on trading platform EBS, its weakest since the
euro's launch in 1999. 
 ""Many investors are using euro/Swiss as a gauge for the
concerns about the problems in the euro zone periphery.
Sovereign risk is still weighing on the euro into year-end,""
said Valentin Marinov, currency strategist at CitiFX.
 ""At some point the SNB may have to resort to more decisive
measures to counter any further decline in euro/Swiss. But we
may have to see further deterioration in the Swiss fundamentals
before this can happen.""
 The dollar was flat at 83.65 yen  with strong support
seen around 82.80 yen, its low from last week. The Bank of Japan
kept monetary policy steady on Tuesday as expected.
[ID:nTKZ006700]
 The Aussie dollar rose 0.1 percent versus the U.S. dollar to
$0.9950 , showing little reaction as the Reserve Bank of
Australia confirmed it was in no hurry to raise rates.

1488,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2010 07:40AM ET</span>",EU threatens snowbound airports with regulation," * EU transport chief concerned over airport service in snow
 * Minimum service rules for airports under consideration
 
 By Pete Harrison
 BRUSSELS, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Europe's transport chief said
on Tuesday he was considering forcing airports to provide
airlines with a minimum level of infrastructure support during
severe weather, such as this week's snowstorms.
 European Union transport commissioner Siim Kallas made his
comments after more than 3,000 flights were cancelled across
Europe on Monday, according to flight authority Eurocontrol.
 ""In recent days, I have become increasingly concerned about
the problems relating to the infrastructure available to
airlines -- airports and ground handling -- during this severe
period of snow,"" Kallas said in a statement. 
 ""We need to ensure that, from infrastructure providers such
as airports and rail infrastructure managers, there are
appropriate service levels and minimum quality requirements that
are followed and delivered,"" he said.
 ""If there is a need for support from the European Commission
in terms of regulation on minimum service requirements for
airports in this area, I am prepared to do that.""
 BAA, which operates London's Heathrow airport and is owned
by Spain's Ferrovial, said the world's busiest international
airport hub would again operate at reduced capacity on Tuesday.
 Analysts believe the freezing conditions will hit the profit
of British Airways by around 10 million pounds ($15.55 million)
a day.
 Kallas' spokeswoman told reporters that the European
Commission, which drafts EU laws, was working on a package of
regulations to cover airports, and that rules on minimum service
could be imposed.
 She said Kallas had a preference for airports to deal with
the problems themselves, and would only intervene if they proved
incapable.
 ""We're taking very clear note of what the airlines are
signalling very clearly, which is their frustration at the
infrastructure that's being provided to them... and their
struggle that they're being held back by severe difficulties
with the airports' capacity and ground handling,"" she said.

 * Most Gulf states to book fiscal surpluses in 2011
 * Inflation seen lower from previous Sept poll
 
 By Martina Fuchs
 DUBAI, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Prospects for growth in Gulf Arab
economies in 2011 have improved slightly from forecasts three
months ago, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday, as rising oil
prices and generous government spending underpin economic
recovery.
 The global downturn cut output and froze credit in the
world's top oil exporting region in 2009, limiting growth in the
six Gulf countries this year.
 But rising crude prices and a pick-up in credit growth will
support growth in 2011, according to the median forecasts of 16
economists polled between Dec. 8-21.
 Saudi Arabia, the largest Arab economy and the world's top
oil exporter, is expected to see economic growth of 4.3 percent
in 2011, up from a forecast 4.2 percent in a Reuters poll in
September. Growth would be higher than a forecast 3.8 percent
this year and a sluggish 0.6 percent in 2009.
 Saudi Arabia on Monday announced an expansionary 2011
budget, with plans to spend 580 billion riyals ($155 billion)
next year, mainly on education and infrastructure projects.
 ""The 2011 budget demonstrates that the kingdom is dedicated
to continuing stimulatory spending to develop the economy and
persuade private investors to do the same as they gradually
emerge from a phase of deleveraging,"" John Sfakianakis, chief
economist at Riyadh-based Banque Saudi Fransi, said.
 ""A slowdown in the pace of budget growth, however, also
signals the state's goal to rein in overspending and employ more
prudent and efficient fiscal policies in the coming years.""
 Saudi Arabia is expected to post a positive fiscal balance
of 4.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2011 compared
to 2.7 percent in 2010, the poll showed.
 Oil prices, which have recovered since December 2008 lows,
will keep Gulf fiscal balances and current accounts in surplus
in 2011, the analysts said.
 A Reuters poll forecast oil prices will average over $86 a
barrel next year on declining inventories and demand growth from
Asia. Crude oil was priced at $89.63 a barrel at 0920 GMT on
Tuesday.
 Qatar, the world's top liquefied natural gas exporter,
should easily outperform the region, with real GDP growth of
12.8 percent in 2011, unchanged from a September forecast,
although it will not match expected growth of 16 percent this
year.
 The economy of OPEC member Kuwait is forecast to grow 4.0
percent in 2011, up from a forecast of 3.9 percent in the
September poll and up from 3.0 percent growth expected in 2010.
Bahrain and non-OPEC member Oman should see GDP growth of 4.2
and 4.6 percent in 2011, respectively, topping forecasts of 4.1
percent and 4.3 percent, respectively, in the September poll.
 Giyas Gokkent, chief economist at National Bank of Abu
Dhabi, said key risks in 2011 were external shocks affecting the
oil price, the outcome of ongoing debt restructuring talks in
the UAE, and geopolitical tensions with Iran.
 ""The whole scenario revolves around where oil prices will
be. If global growth is indeed robust, that is very positive and
oil prices will remain firm,"" he said.
 The UAE -- the second-largest economy in the Arab world --
is seen growing 3.6 percent in 2011, the slowest pace in the
Gulf, but slightly better than 3.5 percent growth forecast in
the September poll.

 INFLATION LOWER IN 2011
 Analysts said inflation would rise in 2011 in all the Gulf
states except Saudi Arabia, although they cut inflation
forecasts for all Gulf Arab countries compared with September's
poll.
 Saudi Arabia should still see the highest inflation rate at
5 percent in 2011 due to rapid population growth, higher housing
costs and rising global food prices. But that is still below the
record peaks seen in most Gulf countries in 2008.
 Consumer prices in Qatar, which has experienced deflationary
pressures, are expected to rise 3 percent next year versus 2
percent deflation in 2010.
 ""Qatar saw deflation in 2010, but will have a rebound in
prices next year because of developments in the housing sector,""
Gokkent said, adding that a substantial amount of housing had
already come to the market, weighing down the consumer price
index.

 * India may cancel mobile licences in corruption inquiry
 
 By Joachim Dagenborg
 OSLO, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg
said the Norwegian government would intervene to assist Telenor
if it asked for help to resolve a brewing scandal over mobile
phone licences in India.
 Indian authorities are mulling whether to cancel dozens of
licences, including some held by Telenor, after an auditor found
the state may have forfeited up to $39 billion when selling them
on the cheap to local companies.
 Telenor, 54-percent owned by the Norwegian state, bought its
licence from Indian conglomerate Unitech in October 2008 and
formed a joint venture that has launched operations in 13 Indian
regions.
 Telenor has denied any wrongdoing in the row, which has
engulfed the Indian government in sleaze allegations.
 Norway's government came to Telenor's aid when it faced dire
legal problems in Russia in 2008-2009, by repeatedly visiting
Moscow to discuss the case with top Kremlin officials.
 ""What we did in Russia was to make sure that ... the justice
system and the authorities worked together as they should,""
Stoltenberg told Reuters on the sidelines of his semi-annual
news conference.
 ""We could do that with Telenor in this case, if there is a
need for it, as (we would) with any other Norwegian company that
needs help, regardless of whether the state is an owner or not.""
 Stoltenberg said Telenor's India troubles were ""not on the
government's table at the moment"". He added: ""To my knowledge,
there has been no contact between us and Telenor in this case.""
 When asked about potential corruption by Telenor in India,
Stoltenberg said that according to Norwegian law, such issues
were a matter for the company's board of directors to consider.

 MANNAR, Sri Lanka, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Sri Lanka may sell
up to $1 billion in a 10-year sovereign bond in 2012, the year
when the island's debut $500 million dollar bond matures,
Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal said on Tuesday.	
 ""We may sell a sovereign bond in 2012. We are looking
longer tenure of at least 10 years and a size of between $500
million to $1 billion,"" he told Reuters, after a tour of the
former northern war zone in Mannar, where the government is
planning several infrastructure projects.	
 ""The amount will be decided according to the requirement
of that time.""	
 The government wants to revive the long-neglected
infrastructure of its $42 billion economy following a 25-year
civil war that ended in May 2009.	
 Sri Lanka has already sold three Eurobonds since 2007 and
the last one, a $1 billion, 10-year bond was
sold in September to yield 6.25 percent. [ID:nTOE68Q06M] 
 Sri Lanka's debut $500 million Eurobond issued in 2007
with a coupon of 8.25 percent is now trading to
yield around 3.2 percent to 3.7 percent.	
 Its second bond sold last year with a
coupon of 7.4 percent, now yields 4.4 percent to 4.6 percent,
Reuters data showed. 
 ""Our spreads are getting tighter now. So we can raise
money at a cheaper rate than the debut bond. We can manage the
repayment of the debut bond in 2012 without much pressure,"" he
said.	
 The governor said the island had no funding needs for
2011, so had not decided whether to issue an international
bond that year or not.	
 The economy, which is expected to expand by near 8 percent
this year from an eight-year low of 3.5 percent in 2009, is
expected to expand robustly in 2011 as well.	
 ""Eight percent should definitely be something that we
should estimate,"" Cabraal said when asked about the economic
growth in 2011, which the central bank will officially
announce on Jan. 4.	
 The central bank has kept its policy rates unchanged at
more than five-year lows even as markets have grown concerned
that private-sector credit growth -- running a more than 20
percent over a year earlier in October -- could be providing
fuel for future inflation. The central bank's year-end target
for credit growth is 15 percent. [ID:nSGE6BD02H]	
 Annual inflation hit a 21-month high in November of 7
percent and has been rising for the last four months, but
Cabraal said price pressures were contained because there is
slack in the economy.	
 ""We are targeting mid-single digits,"" he said, referring
to inflation in 2011. ""We have less of a risk (of inflationary
pressures) mainly because we have a lot of spare capacity that
has not been utilised, particularly in tourism, fisheries, and
agriculture,"" he said.

 * Spanish yields rise moderately at T-bill auction
 * China urges EU action to match words
 * Stark says ECB not in business of financing governments
 By Andre Khalip and Nigel Davies
 LISBON/MADRID, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Portugal was put on notice
on Tuesday that its credit rating could be cut and fellow euro
zone debtor Spain had to pay more to issue new debt, suggesting
the currency bloc's crisis will rage unabated in 2011.
 China, the world's new economic powerhouse, urged European
policymakers to demonstrate as a matter of urgency that they can
contain the euro zone's debt problems and pull the bloc around.
 Ratings agency Moody's said it may cut Portugal's credit
rating by one or two notches within three months, citing weak
growth prospects as the government seeks to cut its debt, and
climbing borrowing costs, although it said its solvency was not
in question.
 ""The likely deterioration in debt affordability over the
medium term and ongoing concerns about the economy's ability to
withstand fiscal consolidation ... mean its outlook may no
longer be consistent with an A1 rating,"" said Anthony Thomas,
Moody's lead analyst for Portugal.
 The cost of insuring Portuguese sovereign debt against
default rose in response and the euro slipped.
 Spain cleared its final debt sale of the year, but
predictably had to pay a higher price and analysts warned of
tough times ahead in 2011. 
 The yield on Spain's three month treasury-bill issue rose to
1.804 percent from 1.743 percent on Nov. 23, while six-month
paper cost 2.597 percent, up from 2.111 percent.
 ""All in all it's a reasonable result in current conditions,
if far from impressive. It's going to be testing times for
Spain, Portugal and even Italy heading into 2011,"" said Orlando
Green, analyst at Credit Agricole.
 Looking back to January this year, the Spanish Treasury paid
just 0.38 percent on three-month paper, and 0.483 percent for
six-month debt.
 A pre-Christmas market lull has taken some of the heat off
peripheral euro zone debt but the ratings agencies are flagging
that the crisis will surely flare up again in 2011.
 Already this month, Moody's has put Spain and Greece on
review for possible downgrades and cut Ireland's rating by a
savage five notches, while Standard & Poor's said it may cut
Belgium's debt rating next year.
Analysts said markets were pricing in even more doom for the
euro zone's weaker members than the ratings agencies.
 ""Really the rating agencies are playing catch up with events
and arguably they've got a long way to go to get back up to
speed -- they've been very much a lagging indicator throughout
the crisis,"" said Chris Scicluna, deputy head of economic
research at Daiwa Capital Markets.
 The president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy,
insisted the EU stood ready to do more if needed to ensure the
stability of the euro zone area.
 European Union leaders failed, at a summit last week, to
agree any specific new measures to stop contagion spreading from
Greece and Ireland, which have received EU/IMF bailouts, to
other high-deficit countries such as Portugal and Spain.
 But they did agree to create a permanent financial safety
net from 2013 to handle future crises.
 ""Those were important decisions to make the euro zone more
crisis-proof, however, we stand ready to do more if needed,"" Van
Rompuy said during a visit to Budapest on Tuesday.

 CHINA CONCERNED
 China, which has invested an undisclosed portion of its
$2.65 trillion reserves in the euro, said it backed steps taken
by European authorities so far but made clear it would like to
see the measures having more effect.
 ""We are very concerned about whether the European debt
crisis can be controlled,"" Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming
said at a trade dialogue between China and the European Union.
 ""We want to see if the EU is able to control sovereign debt
risks and whether consensus can be translated into real action
to enable Europe to emerge from the financial crisis soon and in
a good shape.""
 The European Central Bank has been buying Portuguese and
Irish government bonds to shore them up but not in the size
analysts say is needed to give the markets pause for thought.
 Executive Board member Juergen Stark was quoted on Tuesday
as saying the ECB used its arsenal of extraordinary measures to
ensure the smooth functioning of monetary policy and was not in
the business of financing governments.
 He added that the ECB's bond-buying programme was temporary.
 A bailout of Portugal is widely expected by investors but a
similar rescue for Spain would stretch EU resources to the
limit.
 Moody's said if Lisbon sought international help, it would
ease short-term uncertainties, but would raise concerns about
medium-term access to private market funding.

 (Adds quote, detail)
 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Dec 21 (Reuters) - The euro pared gains against the
dollar in thin trade on Tuesday after ratings agency Moody's put
Portugal on review for a possible downgrade, reinforcing worries
that the euro zone's debt crisis would persist well into 2011.
 The single currency also fell to a fresh lifetime low versus
the Swiss franc as investor concerns over the euro zone
periphery enhanced the safe haven status of the franc. 
 Moody's Investors Service said it may downgrade Portugal's
A1 rating by one or two notches after a review, citing concerns
about the country's weak growth prospects and high borrowing
costs in the latest ratings-related jolt to a euro zone member.
 Comments from a Chinese vice premier that China supports
European Union efforts to calm global markets in the wake of
Europe's debt crisis were enough to trigger a short-covering
rally in holiday-thinned trade in Asia.
 But Beijing's challenge to the EU to deal swiftly with its
debt problems also highlighted the extent of concern over the
still expanding crisis. 
 ""The Moody's announcement on Portugal has knocked some of
today's optimism out of the euro but these credit announcements
are not completely out of the blue any more so the negative
reaction is always going to be a little bit more dampened than
six months ago,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency analyst at
Rabobank.
 ""I don't think this announcement on its own will be capable
of knocking euro/dollar out of its range,"" she said.
 The euro fell around 45 pips on the announcement before
steadying at $1.3150, still up around 0.2 percent on the day. It
made a brief show above $1.3200 in the Asian session, extending
its rebound from Monday's trough of $1.3094, its lowest since
Dec. 2.
 In a positive sign, the currency has managed to crawl back
above its 200-day moving average, now at $1.3102.
 Many market players think pressure will remain on the euro
as a number of investors fret that the debt crisis that has
already engulfed Greece and Ireland could put Portugal and Spain
under more pressure early next year.
 Spain sold 3.88 billion euros in treasury bills relatively
easily on Tuesday, in its last funding exercise of the year, but
euro zone debt worries were likely to persist into 2011.
 ""It seems clear that from January the debt problems will
still be very much there. These countries need to raise a lot of
money early next year."" said Beat Siegenthaler, currency analyst
at UBS in Zurich.
 
 EURO/SWISS RECORD LOW
 The euro slid to a record low against the Swiss franc of
1.2615 francs on trading platform EBS, its weakest since the
euro's launch in 1999.
 ""Many investors are using euro/Swiss as a gauge for the
concerns about the problems in euro zone periphery. Sovereign
risk is still weighing on the euro into year-end,"" said Valentin
Marinov, currency strategist at CitiFX.
 ""At some point the SNB may have to resort to more decisive
measures to counter any further decline in euro/Swiss. But we
may have to see further deterioration in the Swiss fundamentals
before this can happen.""
 The dollar was flat at 83.69 yen with strong support seen at
around 82.80 yen, its low from last week.
 The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady on Tuesday, as
widely expected, holding off on easing.
 The Australian dollar rose 0.1 percent against the dollar to
$0.9950, showing little reaction after the Reserve Bank of
Australia's policy meeting confirmed it is in no hurry to raise
rates.

1496,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2010 06:04AM ET</span>",EU moves to block Icelandic boats in fishing row," * EU takes first step towards ban on Icelandic fish landings
 * Action follows dispute over mackerel quotas
 * Escalation could affect Icelandic bid to join EU
 
 By Pete Harrison
 BRUSSELS, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Europe's fisheries chief has
taken the first step towards blocking Icelandic vessels from
offloading fish in European Union ports in an escalation of a
dispute that threatens Iceland's bid to join the EU.
 EU Fisheries Commissioner Maria Damanaki made a formal
request to the executive of the European Economic Area (EEA) to
meet before Jan. 14 to discuss a possible embargo on Iceland,
her spokesman Oliver Drewes said on Tuesday.
 ""Given the importance of the matter, we consider that this
is a step that we should undertake as a matter of urgency,"" he
said.
 The EEA is a single market grouping the 27 countries of the
EU with Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.
 Iceland, which suffered heavily with the collapse of its
banking system during the economic crisis, started talks this
year on joining the EU, which it hopes may bring greater
stability and financial security.
 But the island of 320,000 people has also sought to cash in
on an explosion of mackerel stocks in its waters, after the fish
started swimming further north than usual.
 That has brought it into conflict with the traditional
mackerel-fishing nations of Scotland, Ireland and Norway, which
have until now managed the catch levels between them.
 The dispute has escalated since fishing talks broke down in
the summer and Iceland unilaterally raised its quota to allow
its fishermen to catch 130,000 tonnes of mackerel, compared to a
traditional catch that the EU estimates at 2,000 tonnes.
 Three EU commissioners, including Damanaki and the
commissioner in charge of EU enlargement, Stefan Fuele, wrote to
Iceland in October warning that failure to find a solution to
the ""mackerel war"" threatened their relations. [ID:nLDE62K04S]
 The conflict has prompted comparisons with the ""cod wars"" of
the 1950s and 1970s, which led to a naval stand-off between
Iceland and Britain.
 Iceland says more than 1 million tonnes of mackerel, a
quarter of the stock, migrated into its exclusive economic zone
during the five-month summer feeding season. It intends to
maintain this year's 17 percent share of the north Atlantic
catch in 2011.
 The EEA's ""Protocol nine"", which governs trade in fish, says
that countries ""may refuse landings of fish from a fish stock of
common interest over the management of which there is a serious
disagreement"".

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, Dec 21 (Reuters) - The euro pared gains on Tuesday
after Moody's put Portugal on review for a possible downgrade,
while world stocks rose, driven by bargain-hunting investors
betting on stronger global growth next year.
 Cold weather in Europe and the United States kept oil prices
firm for the third straight session, while copper hit an
all-time high, buoyed by supply disruption from Chile. 
 U.S. Treasury yields were steady and U.S. stock index
futures    added about 0.3 percent, indicating
a firmer open on Wall Street.
 Moody's Investors Service warned it may cut debt-ridden
Portugal's A1 rating by one or two notches after a review,
citing weak growth prospects and high borrowing costs.
[ID:nLDE6BK0HV]
 That followed its move last week to cut Ireland's credit
rating by five notches to Baa1, the third last investment grade
rank, and put Spain's rating on review for a possible cut.
 The euro  rose 0.3 percent to $1.3159 after trading as
high as $1.3200 earlier in the session, boosted by a
short-covering rally in Asian trade. It fell to a fresh all-time
low against the Swiss franc, at 1.2615 francs .
 The dollar <.DXY> fell 0.2 percent against a basket of major
currencies.
 Concerns that the euro zone sovereign debt crisis will
spread from Greece and Ireland to Portugal and even possibly
Spain and Italy have weighed across global markets.
 ""The Moody's announcement on Portugal has knocked some of
today's optimism out of the euro but these credit announcements
are not completely out of the blue any more so the negative
reaction is always going to be a little bit more dampened than
six months ago,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency analyst at
Rabobank.
 ""I don't think this announcement on its own will be capable
of knocking the euro out of its range.""
 Portuguese bond yields rose, with the premium investors
demand to hold 10-year Portuguese government bonds over German
Bunds   widening by 10 basis points to
371 bps, while Spanish 10-year spreads  moved out
by 3 bps to 259 bps over Bunds.
 Five-year Portuguese credit default swaps, an insurance-like
product against debt default, rose 10 bps to 490 bps.
 ""People are expecting further actions from the ratings
agencies anyway,"" said Charles Diebel, head of market strategy
at Lloyd's TSB in London. 
 
 TAKING STOCK
 Portuguese stocks <.PSI20> rose 0.6 percent, while Europe's
FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index gained 0.7 percent, after
hitting a 27-month high earlier, and Wall Street was poised for
opening gains.
 ""The thing that may have changed in the last few weeks is
the fact that the bond market has sold off,"" said Michael
O'Sullivan, head of global asset allocation at Credit Suisse.
 ""That has been probably causing a lot of people to confront
the fact that in a recovery part of the business cycle
government bonds tend to be worse performing than equities.""
 Shares of basic resources companies <.SXPP> were among the
top gainers in Europe on firmer metal prices.
 In Asia, Japan's Nikkei average <.N225> gained 1.5 percent
to hit a seven-month closing high.
 Global stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> advanced 0.5 percent. The benchmark carries a
one-year forward price-to-earnings of 12.5 times, Thomson
Reuters Datastream showed.
 In terms of sector valuations, energy, financials, telecoms
and the healthcare sector carry one-year forward P/Es with a 4
to 13 percent discount to the world index, while the forward
P/Es for materials and utilities are in line.
 Oil  rose for the third straight session, up 0.7
percent and topping $89 a barrel on the back of cold weather in
Europe and the United States. Copper prices  rose 1.2
percent, their third day of gains, after a halt in shipments by
the world's No. 3 copper mine, Chile's Collahusai.
 Yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries  fell
2 bps to 3.3242 percent. They hit a seven-month high of 3.5675
percent last week.

 Imports rose 10.6 percent from a year earlier to 12.26

key European markets.	
 In September the government revised down its forecast for
economic growth this year to 4.1 percent after a June forecast
of 4.2 percent.	
 In October, Britain was the main buyer of goods from
Mauritius, accounting for 20.2 percent of its exports, while
India supplied 26.5 percent of the island's imports.	
 The government launched a 12 billion rupee stimulus
package in August to help the economy counter challenges as
the euro zone crisis put pressure on the euro, threatening the
island's tourism and European demand for its exports.	
 The government sees the country's trade deficit widening
to 67 billion rupees this year, from 56.9 billion rupees in
2009, due to weak European demand.

 * Single currency near record low vs Swiss franc, Aussie
 * Aussie keeps gains on strength in commodities
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Dec 21 (Reuters) - The euro bounced back from a 2-½
week low on short-covering on Tuesday, though simmering fears
that some euro zone countries and banks could face more borrowing
strain are likely to limit gains.
 Comments from a Chinese vice premier that China supports
efforts by the EU to calm global markets in the wake of Europe's
debt crisis were enough to trigger a short-covering rally in
holiday-thin trade.
 The euro rose 0.3 percent on the day to $1.3176, extending
its rebound from Monday's trough of $1.3094, its lowest level
since Dec. 2.
 ""Price action is becoming swift ahead of the holidays. But I
don't think the euro will reach $1.33,"" said a trader at a
Japanese bank.
 In a positive sign, the currency has managed to crawl back
above its 200-day moving average, now sitting at $1.3102.
 But the euro struggled to break above resistance around the
$1.3165-80 zone, which had been major support for the currency
earlier this month.
 Many market players think pressure will remain on the euro as
a number of investors fret that the debt crisis that engulfed
Greece and Ireland could spread to Portugal and Spain early next
year.
 ""I still think the euro faces downside risks. The market will
probably test the downside towards April, when Spain will have
big redemptions of bonds,"" said Koji Fukaya, chief FX strategist
at Credit Suisse.
 Spain needs to repay about 15 billion euro in April.
 For now though, the market may look to Spain's treasury bills
auction later in the day -- the last debt auction this year from
a struggling member of the euro zone.
 The auction came after Moody's said on Monday it may cut the
ratings on Spanish banks following its multi-notch downgrade of
Ireland's credit rating last week.
 Speculation has risen that France and Belgium may also face
cuts. For more, see
 ""Nothing has really changed on the dire fiscal conditions in

if not before the year-end,"" said Daisuke Karakama, a market
economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank.
 DOWNSIDE TARGET
 The next possible downside target is seen at $1.2969, its low
hit on Nov. 30.
 The euro also stayed within striking distance of a low of
1.2636 Swiss francs marked on trading platform EBS on Monday, its
weakest since the euro's launch in 1999. It was last quoted at
1.2690 franc, up 0.2 percent on the day.
 The single currency stood just above a record trough against
the Australian dollar.
 Firm commodity prices have underpinned the Australian dollar,
as the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index hit two-year highs.
 The Australian currency rose 0.2 percent against the dollar
to $0.9957, returning to an uptrend after hitting a low of
$0.9830 late last week.
 A possible near-term target is $0.9980, a 76.4 percent
retracement of its pullback last week from above parity.
 The Aussie moved little after the minutes from the Reserve
Bank of Australia's policy meeting confirmed the central bank is
in no hurry to raise rates.
 The U.S. dollar slipped a tad against the Japanese yen,
tracking the dollar's fall against the euro, though many traders
see little incentives in either direction in the pair, which has
been stuck in a narrow trading range in the past month.
 The dollar fell 0.1 percent to 83.66 yen but strong support
is seen at around 82.80 yen, its low last week.
 The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady as widely
expected on Tuesday, holding off on easing as it scrutinises how
escalating debt woes in Europe and a U.S.-driven rise in bond
yields affect Japan's fragile economy.

bites

 SINGAPORE, Dec 21 (Reuters) - The euro bounced back on
Tuesday from a day-earlier selloff over euro debt woes
following words of support from China, while stocks were firm
across Asia as investors picked up end-of-year bargains. 
 Japan's Nikkei average closed at a seven-month high.	
 Cold weather in Europe kept crude prices firm for a third
straight session, driving energy-related stocks to be the
biggest gainers in the MSCI Asia ex-Japan share index. U.S.
Treasuries held steady, sticking to narrow price ranges.	
 Comments from Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan that China
supports the measures taken by the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund to calm global markets in the face
of the euro zone's debt crisis prompted a short-covering rally
in the euro currency.	
 ""We hope the measures can achieve some results as soon as
possible,"" Wang told EU trade and economic officials who were
visiting China.	
 Still, China, which has invested an undisclosed portion of
its $2.65 trillion in reserves in the euro, also urged
European authorities to back their tough talk on debt with
action. [ID:nTOE6BK01Q]	
 The euro rose to $1.3194 after Wang's comments,
rising a full cent from a two-week low hit on Monday, when
investors fled from the currency fearing more credit ratings
downgrades in Europe. 
 Euro dropped on Monday as far as $1.3094 and hit a record
low against the Australian dollar and the Swiss franc as
investors fretted about further credit ratings downgrades in
Europe.	
 The firmer tone of the currency also lifted it away form
the record lows it struck on Monday against the Australian
dollar and the Swiss franc.	
 Still, investors suspected the rise in the euro was simply
a temporary reprieve for a currency that has dropped more than
6 percent against the dollar since hitting a 10-month high in
early November.	
 ""I still think the euro faces downside risks,"" said Koji
Fukaya, chief FX strategist at Credit Suisse. ""The market will
probably test the downside towards April, when Spain will have
big redemptions of bonds.""	
 Stock investors looked beyond the euro zone risks for now
to pick up stock ahead of the end of the year.	
 Japan's Nikkei share average rose 1.5 percent for
its highest close since May as investors rooted out bargains
following two straight days of declines. [ID:nTOE6BK03Z]	
 Major electronics maker Sony Corp gained 2.7
percent, construction machinery maker Komatsu Ltd
climbed 1.5 percent and Mitsubishi Motors Corp added
2.5 percent.	
 ""Investors are buying on dips, pushing the Nikkei higher
after yesterday's losses,"" said Takashi Ohba, a senior
strategist at Okasan Securities.	
 ""The Nikkei was flat last week and traders waited for any
positive factors to trade on -- they got a good opportunity
today so the market is posting solid gains,"" Ohba said.	
 A decision by the Bank of Japan to leave policy unchanged
was fully factored into markets. [ID:nTOE6BK00Y] 
 The MSCI index of stocks elsewhere in Asia
rose 1 percent on the day to stand more than 12 percent higher
this year.	
 Hong Kong and Shanghai stocks rose off the
back of firmer coal shares on expectations of more demand
heading into the winter season.	
 China Shenhua Energy firmed close to 5 percent
and China's Sinopec was up 1.4 percent. In Japan,
the country's top refiner JX Holdings gained 1.9
percent. 
 Firmer metals prices pushed miners higher in Australia, to
leave the main S&P/ASX 200 index up 0.8 percent. Seoul
shares hit a three-year high as tensions on the
peninsula eased as North Korea stepped back from a
confrontation over what it called South Korea's ""reckless""
military drills.	
 Snow and freezing temperatures grounded flights and
disrupted travel across northern Europe on Monday, pushing oil
prices higher in Asia on Tuesday for a third straight session.	
 NYMEX February crude futures  rose 0.4 percent to as
high as $89.77 per barrel and heating oil and gas oil also
gained. 
 Gold edged higher to $1,385.90 per ounce . U.S.
10-year bonds fell 2/32 in price in Asia to yield
3.3445 percent, little changed from late New York trade.

 * Aussie keeps gains on strength in commodities
 TOKYO, Dec 21 (Reuters) - The euro remained on the defensive
on Tuesday, barely clinging to its 200-day moving average on
simmering fears that some euro zone countries and banks could
face more borrowing strains.
 Moody's said on Monday it may cut the ratings on Spanish
banks following its multi-notch downgrade of Ireland's credit
rating last week. Speculation has risen that France and Belgium
may also face cuts.
 ""Nothing has really changed on the dire fiscal conditions in
Europe. The euro will likely test $1.30 and head for $1.25 soon,
if not before the year-end,"" said Daisuke Karakama, market
economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank.
 The euro changed hands at $1.3120, hovering just above its
200-day moving average at $1.3102, a break of which could enhance
bearish sentiment.
 The next possible downside target is seen at $1.30, followed
by the December low of $1.2970, traders said.
 On the upside, it will likely face resistance around the
$1.3165-80 zone, which had been major support for the currency.
 The euro also stayed within striking distance of a low of
1.2636 Swiss francs hit on trading platform EBS on Monday, its
weakest since the euro's launch in 1999.
 The single currency stood just above a record trough against
the Australian dollar.
 Firm commodity prices have underpinned the Australian dollar,
as the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index hit two-year highs.
 The Australian currency kept most of its gains made on the
U.S. dollar in the past three sessions, changing hands at
$0.9933.
 The next targets could include $0.9950 and $0.9980, 61.8 and
76.4 percent retracements respectively of its pullback last week
from above parity.
 The immediate focus is on the minutes of the Reserve Bank of
Australia's policy meeting due at 0030 GMT.
 The dollar was little changed against the Japanese yen at
83.78 yen.
 No policy change is expected at the Bank of Japan's two-day
policy meeting that ends on Tuesday.

 * Union challenged China's rare earth export restraints
 * USTR said in October it would investigate charges
 WASHINGTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The United States is nearing
a decision on whether to take action at the World Trade
Organzation against China's rare earth minerals export
restraints or other practices by Beijing to help its clean
energy sector.
 ""We would be very surprised if they don't file a formal
request for consultations,"" said Terry Stewart, an attorney for
the United Steelworkers union, which filed a petition in
September with the U.S. Trade Representative's office.
 Rare earth minerals are used in the production of wind
turbines, electric vehicles, solar cells and energy efficient
lighting.
 China controls about 97 percent of the world trade in rare
earth minerals and has alarmed its trading partners by using
taxes and quotas to restrict export supplies.
 USTR said on Oct. 15 it had accepted the petition and would
decide by the middle of January whether to ask China for
dispute settlement talks at the WTO.
 With Chinese President Hu Jintao due to be in the United
States the week of Jan. 16, ""I think that they might move
(their decision) up,"" said Alan Wolff, a trade lawyer with
Dewey & LeBoeuf not directly involved in the case.
 Wolff, who did a study of China's clean energy policies
earlier this year for a U.S. industry group, also said his
hunch was USTR would initiate a WTO case.
 ""There is an expectation in the Congress I think on both
sides of the aisle that the administration will be forcefully
enforcing trade agreements. If there's any way in which USTR
can bring a case, I think they would,"" Wolff said.
 The steelworkers petition outlined five areas where it said
China's clean energy policies violated WTO rules including the
restrictions on rare earth minerals.
 China slashed its export quota by 40 percent this year and
plans to trim it further next year. It has already announced
increased export taxes on rare earths in 2011.
 The United States, the European Union and Mexico brought a
WTO case against similar restrictions imposed by China on other
critical materials such as bauxite and magnesium. A decision is
still awaited in that litigation.
 China says it need to restrict the exports to protect the
environment and conserve resources.
 Steelworkers charge the curbs are a clear violation of
Beijing's commitment when it joined the WTO to eliminate export
quotas and taxes on all but a select list of products.
 The steelworkers also accuse China of using illegal export
subsidies to promote clean energy technology, discriminating
against imported goods and foreign firms, forcing foreign
investors to transfer technology and providing trade-distorting
subsidies to domestic producers.
 ""The reason the union is so concerned is that violations
are so large and in many cases so obvious,"" Stewart said.
 Wolff said the United States might be reluctant to go after
China's domestic support since many countries provide research
and development grants to support clean energy production.
 However, the steelworkers contend China's ""massive"" clean
energy subsidies have displaced U.S. exports and driven down
prices, making them actionable under the WTO.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on
Monday on fears of fresh credit rating downgrades in Europe
but global stocks edged higher and a bond rally fizzled as
hopes of future rallies in risky assets sparked choppy
trading.
 The euro slid beneath $1.31 after Moody's Investors
Service said it may cut the ratings on some Spanish banks,
driving speculation that France and Belgium may be next in
line after a multinotch downgrade of Ireland's credit rating
last week. For details see: [ID:nN20208943]
 The euro  hit record lows against the Australian
dollar and the Swiss franc as traders fretted over Europe's
fiscal problems. The single currency fell below its 200-day
moving average around $1.3102, usually a bearish sign.
 ""Credit ratings are eroding across much of the common
currency zone as debt continues to increase and economic
growth remains anemic,"" said Karl Schamotta, senior market
strategist at Western Union Business Solutions in Victoria,
British Columbia.
 The euro slid to a session low of $1.3096, according to
Reuters data, and was last trading at about $1.3122.
 U.S. stocks drifted higher, lifted by energy and financial
shares, and European stocks hit a 27-month closing high as
investors rejiggered their portfolios in anticipation of the
new year. [ID:nN20207473] The Morgan Stanley All Country World
Index <.MIWD00000PUS> edged up 0.08 percent to 324.52.
 ""We have seen this year-end rally refuse to give up any
ground,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T
Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.
 Improving economic data, additional economic stimulus from
the Federal Reserve and the extension of Bush-era tax cuts
have combined to keep equities in demand, Hellwig said.
 The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 Index is up 5.6
percent so far in December and up 11.8 percent year to date.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> shed 13.78 points,
or 0.12 percent, to end at 11,478.13. But the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> gained 3.17 points, or 0.25 percent,
to finish at 1,247.08. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC>
added 6.59 points, or 0.25 percent, to close at 2,649.56.
 Stocks in Tokyo were poised to open slightly higher, with
the March futures contract that trades in Chicago for the
Nikkei 225 <0#NK:> up 10 points at 10,310.
 HOT COMMODITIES
 Commodity prices, including oil, rose broadly despite the
stronger dollar, suggesting rising book-squaring activity
before the year's end and likely buying by investors who see
sharper rallies in coming months. [ID:nN20191984]
 Copper, wheat and crude oil all rose 1 percent or more,
even as volumes across energy, metals and agricultural markets
were about 40 percent lower than past 30-day average.
 Oil investors shrugged off the stronger dollar and ongoing
concerns about euro zone debt woes. A rally in gasoline
futures ahead of expected holiday demand and cold weather
supported heating oil futures.
 The expiring U.S. January contract  rose 79 cents to
settle at $88.81 a barrel, while crude oil for February
delivery  rose 77 cents to settle at $89.37.
 ICE Brent crude for February  rose $1.07 to $92.74
a barrel.
 Helping lift crude oil prices was news of a shut pipeline
in Nigeria amid more militant activity and tensions on the
Korean peninsula also lurked as a supportive factor.
 Gold climbed as investors sought a safe haven after the
European Central Bank issued a warning about the region's
finances and following news of Moody's potential downgrade of
some Spanish banks.
 Spot gold  rose $9.84 to $1,384.40 an ounce.
 Prices of long-dated U.S. Treasury prices slipped, ending
a two-day bounce, erasing earlier gains.
 Selling emerged after the Federal Reserve bought
Treasuries in two separate operations, both of them part of
the Fed's plan to keep interest rates low and spur the
economic recovery.
 The benchmark 10-year note  dipped 1/32 in
price, leaving its yield at 3.34 percent, while the 30-year
bond  slipped 5/32 in price to yield 4.44 percent.
 The euro  fell to 1.2678 Swiss francs on EBS
trading platform, its weakest since the euro's launch in
1999.
 The U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> gained 0.31 percent to
80.624.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 0.29
percent at 83.71.

 By Wanfeng Zhou and Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar and hit a record low against the Swiss franc on Monday
and traders said fear of more ratings downgrades for indebted
euro zone countries and banks signaled more losses to come.
 Moody's Investors Service said Monday it may cut the
ratings on Spanish banks following its multi-notch downgrade of
Ireland's credit rating last week. Speculation has risen that
France and Belgium may also face cuts. For more, see:[ID:nLDE6BJ1G1]
 The news drove the euro below its 200-day moving average
around $1.3102, usually a bearish signal. The next downside
target is $1.30, followed by the December low of $1.2970,
traders said.
 ""Credit ratings are eroding across much of the common
currency zone as debt continues to increase and economic growth
remains anemic,"" said Karl Schamotta, senior market strategist
at Western Union Business Solutions, in Victoria, British
Columbia.
 ""As ratings decline,"" he added, ""countries have greater
difficulty borrowing on international markets and interest
rates are consequently forced upward.""
 The euro  slipped 0.5 percent to $1.3119, having
dropped as low as $1.3096, according to Reuters data, its
lowest since Dec. 2.
 The euro also fell below its 200-day moving average against
the dollar in late November, but climbed back above it shortly
thereafter. But analysts said it may struggle to remain there
in thin pre-holiday trade.
 The dollar also slipped 0.2 percent to 83.76 yen ,
hurt by Japanese corporate selling and lower U.S. bond yields.
 ""SERIOUS CONCERNS""
 The euro  fell to 1.2636 Swiss francs on
trading platform EBS, its weakest since the euro's launch in
1999. The euro also hit a record low against the Australian
dollar .
 The euro could fall to 1.20 Swiss francs in 2011, Morgan
Stanley said, noting that ""Switzerland contrasts sharply with
the euro zone and remains perfectly poised to benefit from any
increased sovereign stress concerns in the euro zone.""
 It also looks good compared with other major economies,
said RBC Capital Markets strategist David Watt, noting the
franc has soared against the pound  and was near an
all-time high against the dollar .
 The moves, he wrote in a note to clients, stem from
investor unease about ""structurally impaired"" economies, which
include Britain and the United States.
 But for now, the euro's zone woes will remain front and
center, analysts said, at least until officials clarify how
they will address liquidity problems in troubled economies.
 The European Central Bank expressed ""serious concerns"" that
Ireland's bailout package could affect the institution's
liquidity operations in the euro zone. See [ID:nLDE6BI0HC]
 European Union leaders agreed last week to set up a
permanent crisis management mechanism from mid-2013,
disappointing investors who had hoped for more active measures
such as expanding the European Financial Stability Facility or
issuing joint European sovereign bonds, so-called E-bonds.
 ""Officials' inability to get ahead of the curve in dealing
with the continent's debt crisis .... will keep (the euro)
vulnerable well into 2011,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market
analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 UBS data showed real money accounts led euro selling last
week, followed by leveraged names and corporates.
 ""The cumulative effect of these sustained outflows has been
to send euro positioning deep into net short territory. Euro
shorts are now more extensive than for any other G10 currency
we monitor,"" the firm said in a note.
 Recent data showed speculators continued to hold a net
short position in the euro last week. See [ID:nN17169607]

 * U.S. programs will expire without Senate action
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Valuable U.S. trade benefits
for about 130 developing countries could expire at the end of
the year because of a Republican senator's objection to
duty-free treatment for sleeping bags from Bangladesh.
 With Congress hoping to finish its work this week, Alabama
Senator Jeff Sessions is blocking a vote on a bill to renew the
Generalized System of Preferences program, or GSP, already
approved by the House of Representatives.
 GSP provides duty-free treatment for about 4,800 goods
produced in developing countries to help them create jobs.
 The House bill also renews trade benefits for Colombia,
Peru and Ecuador under the Andean Trade Preferences Act and
extends the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which helps
retrain workers who have lost their job because of import
competition or a factory moving overseas.
 ""I'm not going to stand by and allow nations to cheat on
their trade agreements and manipulate trade agreements that in
effect destroy our industry,"" Sessions said last week in a
speech on the Senate floor.
 Supporters of Bangladesh say the country is not cheating,
but only taking advantage of a provision in the GSP program
that allows poor countries to export sleeping bags to the
United States without paying a 9 percent import duty.
 Earlier this year, President Barack Obama turned down a
request to end the benefit for Bangladesh.
 Sleeping bags have been in GSP since 1992, when U.S.
policymakers determined they are not import sensitive.
 Sessions says the sleeping bag exemption is a ""loophole""
that threatens jobs at Exxel Outdoors, a sporting goods
manufacturer with a plant in his state.
 China, which is not a GSP beneficiary, accounted for about
98 percent of all U.S. sleeping bag imports in 2009. But
Bangladesh's shipments have risen this year.
 The Obama administration, in response to concerns raised by
Sessions and Exxel, conducted an ""expedited review"" of whether
to revoke GSP benefits for sleeping bags.
 Obama, upon the recommendation of U.S. Trade Representative
Ron Kirk, decided against that. But at Exxel's request, the
administration is considering the issue again as part of its
regular annual review of the GSP program.
 CellCorp Global, a Kentucky-based camping products designer
that makes sleeping bags in Bangladesh, is fighting Exxel's
request, which it says would raise prices for U.S. consumers
and hurt employment at its own U.S. operations.

 By Samantha Pearson and Maria Jose Latorre
 SAO PAULO/SANTIAGO, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Chile's peso hit a
31-month high in weak preholiday trading on Monday as the price
of copper, the country's main export, rose sharply.
 The higher price for commodities, a key driver in Latin
America's rapid growth, also boosted the region's currencies.
 But trading is expected to be very light this week as the
year draws to a close and investors go on holiday.
 The Chilean peso  firmed 0.38 percent to 470.20 per
dollar, hitting its strongest level since May 2008.
 ""The peso is still following an appreciation trend, but we
don't see the same momentum as in previous days since we are in
a period when no one does big deals because of the proximity of
the holidays,"" said one trader in Santiago.
 Copper rose toward record highs again on Monday as
inflation expectations, robust Chinese demand and supply kinks
ahead attracted fund inflows. For details, see [ID:nLDE6BJ0U3]
 The Brazilian real  closed 0.41 percent stronger at
1.706 reais per dollar on the local spot market.
 ""The real is going in the opposite direction to most
markets abroad but the volume is very, very low,"" said Andre
Ferreira, director of the Futura Corretora brokerage in Sao
Paulo. ""I'm not seeing any interesting deals.""
 The currency has gained 2.1 percent so far this year. While
the real has underperformed many emerging market currencies, it
is still considered one of the most overvalued in the world
after steady gains for most of the past decade.
 Unlike Chile, Brazil has taken more aggressive measures to
slow the local currency's appreciation in an effort to protect
local exporters.
 ""Despite the persistence of tactics by authorities to try
to prevent their currencies from strengthening, we retain a
broadly positive outlook"" for emerging market currencies, said
Clyde Wardle, an analyst with HSBC in New York.
 ""Rather than choosing where to invest, the main task
remains correctly choosing where in G10 to fund long (emerging
market) positions,"" he added.
 The Mexican currency , which relies less heavily on
the commodity trade, was 0.15 percent weaker at 12.4185 per
dollar.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on
Monday on fears of further credit rating downgrades in Europe
while global stocks wavered as investors fled from riskier
assets to the safety of bonds and gold.
 The euro fell to a session low beneath $1.31 after Moody's
said it may cut the ratings on some Spanish banks. For
details see: [ID:nN2086700]
 The euro slid to record lows against the Swiss franc and
Australian dollar as traders fretted over Europe's debt
problems. Investors already were skittish after last week,
when Moody's downgraded Ireland's credit rating by five
notches.
 Speculation that France and Belgium may also face possible
cuts in their credit ratings also rattled investors.
 The euro  slid beneath $1.31 to a session low of
$1.3096, according to Reuters data.
 ""Credit ratings are eroding across much of the common
currency zone as debt continues to increase and economic
growth remains anemic,"" said Karl Schamotta, senior market
strategist at Western Union Business Solutions in Victoria,
British Columbia.
 World stocks pared gains to trade close to flat even as
European stocks hit a 27-month closing high, with miners
rising on buoyant metal prices and utilities catching up with
the rest of recent gains in the equity markets.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
rose 0.6 percent to end the day at 1,133.43 points, the
highest close since September 2008 when Lehman Brothers
collapsed.
 Regional European utilities, which had been among the
weakest performers in 2010, gained, led by GDF Suez ,
Iberdrola  and Endesa .
 ""The markets may be saying that the euro-zone debts are a
sovereign issue now, not a systemic issue,"" said Richard
Batty, strategist at Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh,
citing plans for a safety net to be set up in 2013.
 Stocks on Wall Street traded near break-even.
 At 1:00 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
down 13.10 points, or 0.11 percent, at 11,478.81. The Standard
& Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 3.33 points, or 0.27 percent,
at 1,247.24. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 7.21
points, or 0.27 percent, at 2,650.18.
 U.S. equity investors were reluctant to push stocks higher
after a run of solid economic data, which has pushed the
benchmark S&P 500 index up 5.4 percent for the month and up
11.6 percent year-to-date.
 ""We are a little elevated here. We've got a little bit of
a nosebleed going,"" said Stephen Massocca, managing director
at Wedbush Morgan in San Francisco.
 Crude oil zigged higher and lower, driven by expiration of
a January futures contract at day's end on the downside and
freezing U.S. and European temperatures on the upside.
[ID:nL3E6NK0F5]
 U.S. crude for January delivery  rose 40 cents to
$88.42 a barrel.
 ICE Brent for February  rose 42 cents to $92.09.
 ""We expect the oil market to continue with its sideways
drift towards year-end, albeit with some weakness likely to
emerge in January,"" said James Zhang from Standard Bank,
expressing concerns about the European debt crisis.
 U.S. Treasury prices rose on the Federal Reserve's bond
purchases and safe-haven demand spurred by worries about
Europe's fiscal problems and heightened tension on the Korean
peninsula. [ID:nN20183904]
 The Fed bought nearly $8 billion in government debt
maturing in eight to 10 years. The U.S. central bank will
target issues due December 2014 to May 2016 worth up to $8
billion later on Monday. See [ID:nTAR001234] [FED/]
 German bund prices also rose as investors sought to reduce
risk ahead of the year-end and Korean tensions.
[ID:nLDE6BJ1M3]
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
up 5/32 in price to yield 3.311 percent.
 The euro  fell to 1.2678 Swiss francs on EBS
trading platform, its weakest since the euro's launch in 1999.
The Swiss currency was helped by safe-haven buying.
 The euro  was down 0.46 percent at $1.3119 against
the dollar, which was up against a basket of major currencies.
The U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> gained 0.28 percent to 80.598.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 0.24
percent at 83.75.
 The flight to safety pushed gold up for a second day, as
the metal overcame the euro's weakness after a warning from
the European Central Bank on the region's finances encouraged
light safe-haven flows into bullion.
 Spot gold prices  rose $8.65 to $1,383.30 an ounce.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar and hit a record low versus the Swiss franc on Monday,
with more losses likely as markets were hit by fears of further
ratings downgrades of debt-stricken euro zone countries and
banks.
 Moody's Investors service said on Monday it may cut the
ratings on some Spanish banks following its multi-notch
downgrade of Ireland's credit rating last week. Speculation has
risen that France and Belgium may also face possible cuts.
 The euro broke below its 200-day moving average around
$1.3102, usually a bearish signal. The next downside target is
$1.30, followed by the December low of $1.2970, traders said.
 ""Credit ratings are eroding across much of the common
currency zone as debt continues to increase and economic growth
remains anemic,"" said Karl Schamotta, senior market strategist
at Western Union Business Solutions, in Victoria, British
Columbia.
 ""As ratings decline, countries have greater difficulty
borrowing on international markets and interest rates are
consequently forced upward,"" he added.
 The euro  slipped 0.5 percent to $1.3116, having
dropped as low as $1.3094 on trading platform EBS, its lowest
since Dec. 2. The euro also fell below its 200-day moving
average against the dollar in late November, but it climbed
back above it shortly thereafter.
 The cost of insuring French sovereign debt against default
rose to a record high on Monday, according to data monitor
Markit. For more, see [ID:nLDE6BJ1G1]
 The euro  fell to 1.2636 Swiss francs on EBS,
its weakest since the euro's launch in 1999, with the Swiss
currency benefiting from its safe-haven status. The euro also
hit a record low against the Australian dollar .
 The dollar index <.DXY> rose to 80.616, having been
underpinned in Asia on safe-haven flows due to renewed tensions
on the Korean peninsula. [ID:nL3E6NK01M]
Against the yen, the dollar eased 0.3 percent to 83.75
, weighed by Japanese corporate selling and as U.S. bond
yields fell.
 'SERIOUS CONCERNS'
 Analysts said the euro will likely continue to struggle
until European officials clarify how they will address funding
and liquidity problems in the region's troubled economies.
 The European Central Bank expressed ""serious concerns"" that
Ireland's bailout package could affect the institution's
liquidity operations in the euro zone. See [ID:nLDE6BI0HC]
 European Union leaders agreed last week to set up a
permanent crisis management mechanism from mid-2013,
disappointing investors who had hoped for more active measures
such as expanding the European Financial Stability Facility or
issuing joint European sovereign bonds, so-called E-bonds.
 ""Officials' inability to get ahead of the curve in dealing
with the continent's debt crisis remains a key liability for
the euro and likely one that will keep it vulnerable well into
2011,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth
Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 UBS flow data showed real money, or unleveraged, accounts
led the euro selling last week, followed by leveraged names and
corporates.
 ""The cumulative effect of these sustained outflows has been
to send euro positioning deep into net short territory. Euro
shorts are now more extensive than for any other G10 currency
we monitor,"" the firm said in a note.
 The latest FX positioning data showed speculators continued
to hold a net short position in the euro last week, although
net shorts were trimmed from the previous week. Net longs in
the Swiss franc increased. See [ID:nN17169607]

 The euro could fall to 1.20 Swiss francs in 2011, Morgan

and remains perfectly poised to benefit from any increased
sovereign stress concerns in the euro zone,"" the firm said.

 (Adds closing prices)
 ISTANBUL, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The lira hit its weakest level
in five months and bonds and stocks fell on Monday, hit by a
warning from the IMF on price pressures in the Turkish economy
following recent official cuts in interest rates.
 Bearish external influences were also a major factor, with
rising tensions in the Korean peninsula and Europe's debt
concerns weighing on sentiment.
 The International Monetary Fund issued a review of Turkey
late on Friday in the wake of measures by the Turkish Central
Bank aimed at cooling ""hot money"" inflows that were making the
lira currency too strong and exacerbating a widening current
account deficit.
 The Central Bank cut short term interest rates, including
its key repo rate, late on Thursday and raised banks' reserve
requirement ratios for short term maturities. 
 The IMF's brief statement gave no indication of whether it
had known about the rate decision before completing its report.
 Some analysts saw the use of rate cuts risks overheating an
already fast-growing economy and the Fund said interest rates
may need to rise if other tightening measures to deliver price
stability proved ineffective.
 The IMF staff urged fiscal and regulatory tightening and
said liquidity remained excessive.
 TEB Investment said that, while generally endorsing the
Turkish central bank's policies, the IMF report criticised the
accelerated foreign exchange purchase programme and the
long-term commitment to low short-term rates.
 Markets were still adjusting to the various policy
instruments set to work by the central bank, though the 0.5
percentage point cut in the repo rate had been foreseen.
 ""Through this period, we would also expect greater
volatility in short-term rates as evidenced by the Central
Bank's decision to widen the corridor between overnight
borrowing and lending rates,"" Inan Demir, an economist at
Finansbank AS, wrote in a report.
 The yield on the benchmark Aug. 8 2012 bond <0#TRTSYSUM=IS>
climbed to 7.43 percent after closing at 7.36 percent on Friday.
 ""Bond yields have rebounded to just above 7.4 percent in
response to client repos being made subject to reserve
requirements, which increases the costs of funding by about 50
basis points,"" TEB Investment said its daily market commentary.
 The lira  closed at 1.5560 to the dollar, its weakest
close in five months, and marked a fourth consecutive day on a
weakening trend. It closed on Friday at 1.5484.
 The lira's weakest level in intra-day trading was 1.5661,
but that was struck in thin end of day trade.
The benchmark Istanbul stock index <.XU100> closed 0.04
percent lower at 63,501.58, while the emerging share benchmark
<.MSCIEF> was down 0.4 percent.
 Tekfen Holding  shares rose 2.6 percent to 6.3
liras after it said a unit of the company had signed a $170
million deal with Moroccan government company Maroc Phosphore.
 TEB Investment noted that banks, foreigners' favourite picks
in Turkey, have matched their lowest close versus the
industrials index since June 2009. Bank shares weighing is more
than 50 percent of the gauge. Turkish banking index, <.XBANK>
added 0.9 percent, after falling earlier today.
 ""Bank shares are getting hit after the central bank
measures last week,"" said Mehmet Ilgen, a trader at Ata Invest
in Istanbul said in an e-mailed response to questions.

 * Baltic states used to having little currency flexibility
 * More risks inside euro than outside-Polish central bank
 
 By David Mardiste
 TALLINN, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Estonia, which adopts the euro
on Jan. 1, is likely to be the last new entrant to the currency
zone for some years as bigger eastern European states such as
Poland and the Czech Republic watch the bloc's crisis warily.
 For the Baltic state of 1.3 million, being in the euro zone
club is preferable to uncertainty linked to its outgoing kroon
currency and is seen as a way to attract further investment.
 Adopting the euro is also the culmination of Estonia's move
westwards away from the dominance of mighty neighbour and former
ruler Russia after entering the European Union and NATO in 2004.
 Ordinary Estonians are also hoping for the smaller benefits
of saving money on currency transactions.
 Homeowners, too, will benefit as most mortgages, which are
mainly provided by big Nordic banks such as Swedbank, SEB and
Nordea are already in euros.
 Fellow Baltic states Latvia and Lithuania have set their
sights on euro entry in 2014.
 ""In Estonia we are also sure that the euro will support
trade,"" Prime Minister Andrus Ansip told Reuters Insider,
pointing to gains for ordinary people. ""Now people are just
wasting their money in the currency exchange, why do they have
to do that?"" he said.
 But elsewhere in the former Communist bloc, governments are
not so certain. All the central and eastern European EU members
have to join the euro zone one day, but they are in no hurry.
 They want to see how the debt problems of Ireland, Greece,
Spain and Portugal, which are struggling with big budget
deficits, are solved and fear the cost of losing exchange rate
flexibility. They have also seen that being a euro zone member
does not guarantee lower borrowing costs, investment bank JP
Morgan said in a research note.
 ""There are more risks to being in the euro zone than being
outside,"" Polish central bank governor Marek Belka said last
week..
 A flexible exchange rate, which allowed the zloty to
decline, has been seen as one of the main reasons why Poland was
the only EU country to avoid a recession last year.
 Belka said Poland should not rush to join the currency bloc,
although the strategic goal was still to switch from the zloty.
 Similar sentiments have come from the Czech Republic, where
Prime Minister Petr Necas has said adopting the euro would not
be to the country's advantage for a long time.
 ""The Czechs have always been more cautious and the Poles are
getting more cautious too,"" said Capital Economics senior
economist Neil Shearing.
 He said that if the euro zone survived in its current form
the next new entrant would not be until 2015 in the shape of
Latvia and Lithuania, whose economies, outlooks, currency pegs
and historical experience were similar to Estonia's.
 JP Morgan said it had pushed back its forecast for euro
adoption in Hungary and Poland to 2019, and to beyond 2020 for
the Czech Republic. ""This is five years later than our forecast
at the start of the year,"" it said.
 
 ESTONIA READY
 Estonia's debt and budget deficit are among the lowest in
the euro zone. To meet euro entry terms, Ansip's centre-right
government made budget deficit cuts equal to more than 9 percent
of GDP. Inflation also fell as the economy contracted nearly 14
percent in 2009 after a pre-crisis boom.
 Estonia, like Latvia and Lithuania, is used to having little
currency flexibility. The kroon has been fixed, to the German
mark and then to the euro, since its launch in 1992 when Estonia
became the first ex-Soviet state to quit the rouble zone.
 It also expects its economic prospects to improve after the
2009 recession, which was worsened by the austerity measures.
The central bank expects growth next year of 3.9 percent.
 Andres Kasekamp, director of the Estonian Foreign Policy
Institute, said euro adoption would be a security watershed
given continued tetchy relations with Russia.
 ""The foreign policy goals of Estonia have been to embed
itself in as many international organisations and clubs as
possible, so that it will never find itself isolated or without
friends ever again,"" he said.
 ""Membership of the euro zone will not only boost Estonia's
economic prosperity, but will enhance security,"" he said.
 
 SOME SCEPTICS
 Despite official enthusiasm, opinion polls have given a
mixed picture of support for the changeover.
 ""We are joining at the worst possible time and cannot be
sure the euro zone will exist in the same form as it does now.
Even next year there could be very big changes or reforms,"" said
lawyer Anti Poolamets, who leads an anti-euro campaign.
 Poolamet commissioned an opinion poll which showed 53
percent of people were against the euro. A poll taken for the
government showed support for the euro at 54 percent.
 A steady rise in inflation in recent months has also caused
some worries, although the government and central bank have
blamed it on factors such as food and energy prices.
 In general, Estonians are calmly preparing for the
switchover, as they calmly suffered crisis and recession after
the collapse of the Soviet Union and in 2009.
 ""I will miss the kroon, but only because I am used to using
them. I will get used to euros quickly enough and they are more
useful for travelling,"" said student Reio Maesalu, who at 18 is
the same age as the outgoing currency.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - World stocks pared
gains to trade slightly lower on Monday while the euro fell
broadly on concerns over the euro zone debt crisis.
 Government bond prices on both sides of the Atlantic rose
on safe-haven demand spurred by worries over the fiscal shocks
in Europe and heightened tension between North and South Korea.

 The euro slid to a two-week low versus the U.S. currency
and record lows against the Swiss franc and Australian dollar

 ""Officials' inability to get ahead of the curve in dealing

 The euro remained under pressure after EU leaders last week
failed to produce a permanent financial safety net for the

 * Hope to complete technical discussions in spring
 * Some businesses concerned WTO entry may hurt them
 
 By Toni Vorobyova
 MOSCOW, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Russia's 17-year bid to join the
World Trade Organisation still hinges on agreements being
reached on meat imports and agricultural subsidies, Moscow's WTO
negotiator Maxim Medvedkov said on Monday.
 Russia hopes to finally join the 153-member trade body next
year, after securing formal backing from the European Union this
month and resolving some key issues with the United States.
 But Medvedkov said potential stumbling blocks remained.
 ""The access to the meat market remains an issue ... (and)
the size of support for the agriculture sector,"" he said on the
sidelines of a round-table on WTO membership.
 Russia, the biggest export market for U.S. chicken meat,
regulates imports with a quota system to stimulate domestic
production. It hopes to become self-sufficient in pork and
poultry meat in the next 2-3 years.
 Medvedkov said the meat issue had not been discussed between
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and U.S. counterpart Barack
Obama when they reached a broad rapprochement on Moscow's bid.
 As well as the United States, the meat issue concerns other
countries, such as Brazil and Argentina, he added.
 Russia currently offers strong state support for the
agriculture sector -- all the more so after farmers were hit
this summer by the worst drought in over a century.
 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin last week pledged 120 billion
roubles ($3.90 billion) in state support for the sector in 2011.
 Medvedkov declined to comment on the chances of Russia
joining the WTO next year.
 ""Next spring, we hope to complete all the technical
discussions,"" he said. But he added, without giving details,
that more issues might arise once the technical agreements were
in place.
 Analysts say that WTO membership should boost Russia's image
and encourage foreign investors, but that it will take years for
the economy to match global competitiveness.
 Medvedkov said studies showed no jobs should be lost as a
direct consequence of WTO membership. But some representatives
of business and politics at the round-table were not convinced.
 ""I, like any producer in our country, who provides jobs and
pays taxes, I need one simple word -- 'protectionism',"" said
Vladimir Toporkov, chief executive of Russian Holding Company.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on
Monday, hitting a record low against the Swiss franc, with more
losses likely as investors fretted over euro zone debt
problems.
 The euro also declined to a two-week low versus the U.S.
currency and a record low against the Australian dollar as
traders still reacted to Moody's multi-notch downgrade of
Ireland's credit rating last week.
 ""Continued debt concerns kept investors wary of holding the
single currency,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 ""Officials' inability to get ahead of the curve in dealing
with the continent's debt crisis remains a key liability for
the euro and likely one that will keep it vulnerable well into
2011,"" he added.
 The euro fell to 1.2678 Swiss francs on the EBS trading
platform, its weakest since the euro's launch in 1999, with the
Swiss currency helped by investors seeking safety.
 Analysts said the euro remained under pressure after
European Union leaders failed last week to produce a
substantive plan to bulk up a temporary support fund for the
region's weaker economies.
 Debt problems facing the euro zone were also highlighted as
the European Central Bank expressed ""serious concerns"" that
Ireland's bailout package could affect the institution's
liquidity operations in the euro zone.
 EURO SELLING LAST WEEK
 UBS flow data showed real money, or unleveraged, accounts
led the euro selling last week, followed by leveraged names
and corporates.
 ""The cumulative effect of these sustained outflows has been
to send euro positioning deep into net short territory. Euro
shorts are now more extensive than for any other G10 currency
we monitor,"" the firm said in a note.
 The latest FX positioning data from the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission showed speculators continued to hold a net
short position in the euro last week, although net shorts were
trimmed from the previous week, while net longs in the Swiss
franc increased.
 The euro slipped 0.2 percent against the dollar to $1.3156,
having dropped as low as $1.3125 earlier in the global session,
its lowest since Dec. 2.
 The single currency also hit a record low against the
Australian dollar around A$1.3208, as both the Australian and
New Zealand dollars benefited from gains in equity and
commodity prices.
 TECHNICAL SUPPORT
 Traders said demand for euros from Russian participants in
early European trade had run into selling by Swiss names, while
a U.S. investment house was reported selling euros on behalf of
a real money account.
 Near-term support for the euro/dollar was located at
$1.3102, its 200-day moving average. A break below could see
the currency retest the $1.30 level and drop toward its
December low of $1.2970, traders said.
 While further losses remained likely, some analysts said
investors seemed to lack conviction to push the euro much lower
at the moment.
 ""The euro has remained within its month to date range of
1.2969 to 1.3499, and traders seem to lack conviction on the
path that lies ahead,"" said Camilla Sutton, chief currency
strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 Traders said activity was dwindling ahead of the Christmas
holidays at the end of the week in many financial centers.
 The dollar index was steady at 80.399, having been
underpinned in Asia on safe-haven flows due to renewed tensions
on the Korean peninsula as South Korea held live-fire drills in
a disputed area Monday.
 The dollar eased 0.3 percent to 83.66 on Japanese corporate
selling.

(Adds governor, analyst comments, background)
 By Marton Dunai and Gergely Szakacs
 BUDAPEST, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank (NBH)
raised interest rates  for the second time in two months
on Monday and said it may need further tightening in the next
months to defend its inflation target.
 The quarter percentage point increase brings the base rate
to 5.75 percent  and is seen by some analysts as the
bank's response to mounting government pressure for it to do
more to boost economic growth.
 The NBH's main tool to fight inflation is trying to keep the
forint strong by lifting interest rates. That may prove hard as
Europe's debt crisis continues, given that Hungary has the
highest debt and credit risk in Central Europe.
 The bank highlighted the risk that an improving economy will
generate above-target inflation in the next two years.
 ""The Monetary Council has decided to raise the base rate in
light of inflation remaining persistently above the 3 percent
target as well as the upside risks to inflation,"" the bank said
in a statement after the decision.
 ""In the coming months, the Council will decide whether to
raise interest rates after weighing up the balance of inflation
risks,"" it added.
 
 POLITICAL TENSION
 NBH Governor Andras Simor told a news conference the
inflation outlook warranted the rate rise, while he played down
the bank's tensions with the centre-right Fidesz government
which has called for lower interest rates.
 The government has also cut the pay of rate setters and said
after the November rate hike that it had been ""unjustified.""
 Many analysts have seen the bank's tightening as part of a
policy battle with the government whose unorthodox fiscal moves
have contributed to higher inflation pressures and higher risk
premia on Hungarian assets.
 They also say the bank may be seeking to carry out
tightening before March, when the mandates of four of its rate
setters will expire -- and the government may pack the Monetary
Council with its own ""dovish"" candidates.
 Tensions between the bank and the government are expected to
remain high in coming months.
""Hungarian assets will continue to carry a hefty risk premium
well into 2011,"" said Neil Shearing of Capital Economics.
 Hungary's credit default swap (CDS) spreads ,
which measure default risk on sovereign debt and are watched by
the central bank, at around 380 basis points are the highest in
the region.
 Expectations for monetary tightening have lifted the forint
 but it retreated on Monday to trade at 276.20 at
1505 GMT, 1.2 percent weaker from Friday.
The NBH and analysts see inflation exceeding the bank's 3
percent goal in the next two years, partly due to an expected
pickup in domestic demand, and also to inflationary pressures
from special taxes levied on certain sectors of the economy.
 
 MORE TIGHTENING SEEN
 Last month's surprise rise was the first by a central bank
in the European Union's eastern wing since the 2008 global
crisis, even though Hungary's economy has been slower to recover
than Poland or the Czech Republic.
 Analysts projected in a Reuters poll that the base rate
would peak at 6 percent in early 2011 before heading downwards
later next year [ID:nSLAGNE6KN].
 The Polish and the Czech banks are set to keep rates on hold
at record lows -- at 3.5 percent, and 0.75 percent, respectively
-- at their meetings on Wednesday. [ID:nLDE6BF1KU]
 Poland is unlikely to tighten rates until early next year
and the Czechs until the second quarter of 2011. The central
bank of Romania -- which still struggles to get out of recession
-- is seen lowering its 6.25 percent main rate in 2011.

 By Pedro Nicolaci da Costa
 WASHINGTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Wall Street banks have been
gripped by a certain euphoria in recent weeks, with their
economists touting a modest improvement in U.S. data as an omen
of more robust growth to come in 2011.
 Housing figures next week may inject a dose of sobriety
into these forecasts. Anticipation of a strong expansion,
coupled with worries about the budget deficit following a new
tax deal in Washington, have pushed Treasury bond yields that
directly affect mortgage rates sharply higher.
 This raises the concern that a still-struggling housing
sector, the epicenter of the country's worst financial crisis
in generations, may yet see further deterioration.
 With Europe still reeling from a debt crisis that just will
not go away, another bump on the road for the U.S. economy
might deprive the global recovery of not one but two key
engines.

 A report on Wednesday is expected to show existing U.S.
home sales, which account for the bulk of the market, rose by
about 300,000 units on an annualized basis to 4.71 million in
November. That would mark a move further away from the 15-year
low seen in the summer, but it would still be a far cry from
record peaks over 7 million in 2005.
 ""We're still in an economy that isn't in a normal recovery
mode,"" said Edward Leamer, director of Anderson Forecast at the
University of California, Los Angeles. ""Unless we get housing
and construction jobs back, we will not get a robust recovery.
We will be stuck with high unemployment rates indefinitely.""
 That view contrasts with the burst of optimism prevailing
in financial markets over the last month. Some economists,
encouraged by what they see as the stimulative effects of a
fiscal agreement between President Barack Obama and Republican
lawmakers, are looking for U.S. gross domestic product to
expand more than 4 percent next year.
 For others, however, a battered housing market and bleak
job prospects are a major risk to the recovery.
 ""The U.S. economy is showing some sparks of life in late
2010,"" said Ken Goldstein, an economist at The Conference
Board, an industry-backed research group. ""The indicators point
to a mild pickup after a slow winter. Looking further out,
possible clouds on the medium-term horizon include weakness in
housing and employment.""
 A Reuters poll of more than 70 economists suggests U.S. GDP
will rise 2.7 percent in 2011, up sharply from 2.3 percent in a
November poll but still too low a level to make much headway in
reducing the nation's 9.8 percent jobless rate. For details,

 EUROPE'S MORASS
 Looming in the backdrop is a European debt debacle that
seems to get more convoluted by the week.
 Just two days after Ireland's parliament approved an $85
billion rescue from the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund, the IMF warned the country still faces big risks
that could affect its ability to repay the loan. Moody's, the
ratings agency, slashed Dublin's credit grade and European
banks warned of future losses on Irish assets.
 Investors' concern about the credit-worthiness of highly
indebted euro zone countries will make it hard for some states
to finance hefty debt repayments in the first half of 2011,
even as new issuance in the bloc falls. [ID:nLDE6BF219]
 Euro zone countries are expected to borrow less in the bond
markets in 2011 than they did this year, but the interest rates
investors are demanding pose a burden that may become
unsustainable for the likes of Spain and Portugal.
 Unlike in the spring, when Europe's problems disrupted
interbank lending and dented U.S. growth, such effects have not
been felt in the latest, more drawn-out round of debt
negotiations. But analysts say the threat remains very real.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The euro hit an all-time low
against the Swiss franc and slipped versus the dollar on Monday
as investors looked for more aggressive solutions from European
leaders to the euro zone's debt problems.
 The single currency  fell to around 1.2693 Swiss
francs on EBS trading platform, its weakest since the euro's
launch in 1999 with the Swiss currency helped by investors
seeking safety, though trading was seasonally thin and illiquid.
 The euro continued to smart from last week's five-notch
Irish rating downgrade by Moody's, and analysts said it would
continue to struggle until European officials clarify how they
will address funding and liquidity problems of indebted
countries.
 ""The ratings change at the end of last week is still keeping
the euro under selling pressure,"" said Carl Hammer, currency
strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 The euro  slipped 0.1 percent against the dollar to
$1.3160, having dropped as low as $1.3125 in earlier trade, its
lowest since Dec. 2.
 The single currency also hit a record low against the
Australian dollar  around A$1.3243 as both the
Australian and New Zealand dollars benefited from gains in
equity and commodity prices.
 SEB's Hammer said a swap arrangement between the ECB and the
Bank of England [ID:nFLAHNE6GD] last week to boost sterling
liquidity for Irish banks underlined that their problems had not
been fully resolved by the country's bailout last month.
 Analysts said the euro remained under pressure after EU
leaders last week failed to produce a substantive plan to bulk
up a temporary support fund for the region's weaker economies.
 Debt problems facing the euro zone were also highlighted as
the European Central Bank expressed ""serious concerns"" that
Ireland's bailout package could affect the institution's
liquidity operations in the euro zone. [ID:nLDE6BI0HC]
 ""Until there's more clarity on where ultimate responsibility
lies -- not just fiscal but at the policy level -- we'll be
living with this issue for quite some time,"" said Ned Rumpeltin,
head of G10 currency strategy at Standard Chartered, who
forecasts the euro will slide to $1.20 by mid-2011.
 Traders said demand for euros from Russian participants in
early European trade had run into selling by Swiss names, while
a U.S. investment house was reported selling euros on behalf of
a real money account.

 TECHNICAL SUPPORT
 The euro stayed within a relatively tight range against the
dollar, however, with technical support around $1.3100-1.3090, a
retracement level and its 200-day moving average. Below that,
there is also support at the late November low around $1.2964.
 Traders said activity was dwindling ahead of holidays at the
end of the week in many financial centres.
 ""The euro will struggle to sustain rallies, but it is hard
to see any real directionality until the new year,"" said Elsa
Lignos, currency strategist at RBC.
 The latest FX positioning data showed speculators continued
to hold a net short position in the euro last week, although net
shorts were trimmed from the previous week, while net longs in
the Swiss franc increased.

1560,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2010 07:44AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Iran central bank repatriating foreign bank deposits," (Adds details, background)
 TEHRAN, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The Central Bank of Iran has
decided to repatriate an unspecified amount of its deposits from
foreign bank accounts, its governor said on Monday, citing
global economic conditions as the reason.
 ""The CBI decided to lower the volume of its foreign deposits
and transfer them inward by depositing them at domestic banks,""
the official IRNA news agency quoted Mahmoud Bahmani as telling
a banking seminar.
 ""It was agreed these deposits should be used to meet the
financial needs of domestic projects through hard currency
rather than rials so that the domestic inflation rate would not
be aggravated,"" he said.
 Iran has come under tighter economic sanctions since June,
aimed at pressuring it to curb its nuclear programme which some
countries fear is aimed at making atomic weapons. Some of the
measures restrict financial transactions.
 In August, Bahmani said Iranian assets had been withdrawn
from European banks in an attempt to foil the sanctions. Then as
now he gave no further details.
 The repatriation of funds might indicate concerns about
Iran's ability to access its cash due to sanctions or a need for
more hard currency in Iran to pay for investment projects, some
of which have suffered from the withdrawal of foreign companies
under sanctions pressure.
 In addition to the sanctions pressure, the Iranian economy
is undergoing a major shakeup as the government slashes the
billions of dollars in subsidies it pays every year to hold down
prices of essential items. The policy began in earnest on Sunday
when the price of gasoline quadrupled.
 Ahmadinejad calls move to eventually eliminate some $100
billion of subsidies ""the biggest economic plan in the past 50
years"". While economists say the measure is needed to curb
wasteful consumption they say it risks stoking inflation as
prices of food, fuel and transport soar.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - World stocks edged higher towards
a recent two-year high on Monday while the euro hit a two-week
low as concerns over the euro zone debt crisis stayed in focus
following last week's Irish rating downgrade.
 Tensions in Korea also made investors wary. Despite threats
of war by Pyongyang, South Korea launched live-fire drills on a
disputed island after an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting
failed to agree on how to defuse the crisis.
 Last week's five-notch credit rating downgrades of Ireland
by Moody's and the absence of immediate steps from European
leaders to contain the crisis weighed on the single currency
while supporting safe-haven German government bonds.
 ""The ratings change at the end of last week is still keeping
the euro under selling pressure,"" said Carl Hammer, currency
strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 ""There is an underlying uncertainty with regards to the euro
zone which is very much in focus.""
European Central Bank head Jean-Claude Trichet warned on
Monday Ireland needed to follow its bailout plan to the letter,

 The euro fell as low as $1.3125  before trimming

 * Crop boosted by increased water supplies
 * Iraq is one of world's largest grain importers
 
 By Khalid al-Ansary
 MESHKHAB, Iraq, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The yellow fields on the
banks of the Euphrates are producing higher yields of aromatic
Iraqi No. 1 rice this year thanks to increased water supplies
and enough electricity to run irrigation pumps.
 Standing over a massive pile of unhusked brown rice, farmer
Adil Hassan tosses his crop into the air with a hand shovel to
separate the chaff and expose the rice to the sun to dry.
 Aided by government-subsidised fertilizer and insecticides,
Iraqi farmers like Hassan are having some success increasing
production along the Euphrates south of Baghdad in an area that
was the heart of the ancient world's Fertile Crescent.
 Government officials are projecting an 11 percent increase
in rice yield per hectare from this year's harvest over last,
and 18 percent better than two years ago.
 ""Our problem is water and electricity every year,"" said
Hassan, 29, as his four small children played nearby. ""When
there is water, there is no electricity ... we can't water all
the planted land. Or vice versa.
 ""The yield is much better this year than last because of the
availability of water and fertilizer,"" Hassan said recently in
the midst of the yearly harvest in the area of Meshkhab.
 Iraq is one of the world's top 10 importers of rice and
wheat, which are purchased by the government to supply a huge
food rationing programme held over from the Saddam Hussein era.
 Decades ago, Iraq's bread basket was a leading producer. It
exported wheat and barley and was, at one time, the world's top
exporter of dates.
 But entrenched problems with soil salinity, poor irrigation
and in the last three years, a severe drought, combined to make
it a major buyer on world markets.
 Encouraged by the high prices offered by the government,
farmers like Hassan, whose families have worked the land in the
Euphrates basin for generations, are boosting planted acreage
and yield in the Najaf region south of Baghdad.
 ""Every season the planted acreage increases because the
prices are good and this encourages the farmer to increase the
planted acreage,"" said Hakim Takleef, a spokesman for the Najaf
agricultural department. ""In addition, the government subsidises
the agricultural requirements needed.""
 
 PRODUCTIVITY BOOST
 The government offers its farmers $583 per tonne for rice,
far more than the $420-$430 per tonne it pays for imported rice
on world markets.
 The Iraqi grain board expects farmers to sell the government
between 150,000 and 175,000 tonnes of rice this year, a big
improvement over last year's harvest of 119,000 tonnes but still
far from meeting the country's growing needs.
 Iraq consumes 1.2 million tonnes annually, according to
government figures.
 The government has consolidated the rice crop in three
central provinces, Najaf, Diwaniya and Wassit, allowing it to
direct more water to fewer fields.
 As a result, planted acreage of rice nationwide has fallen
in the last three years, according to government figures, from
about 85,000 hectares in 2008 to around 48,000 this year.
 Yield has gone up each of those years, from about 2,900 kg
per hectare in 2008 to a projected 3,460 kg this year, officials
said.
 Farming is one of Iraq's biggest employers but contributes
less than 3 percent to state revenue, far behind the oil sector,
which accounts for 95 percent of the federal budget.
 The sector gets little government investment as Iraq focuses
on tapping its vast oil reserves for the billions of dollars it
needs to rebuild after years of war and economic sanctions.
 Rice farmers saw some relief this year from a crippling
three-year drought as the ministry of water resources captured
winter rain and snow in reservoirs and put the extra supplies to
work this summer.
 At the same time, Iraq's feeble electrical grid is supplying
a bit more power, allowing farmers to run pumps to carry water
from canals to the fields.
 Future yield gains for Iraq's farmers, however, may be
limited by factors out of Iraq's control.
 As an example, Turkey's controversial Ilisu hydroelectric
project, which would dam the Tigris in Iraq's neighbour to the
north, could limit the flow of water to Iraq.
 Hassan is hopeful he will be able to continue to boost the
yield in his fields but says he needs the government's help.
 ""If, in the coming years, the government increases the
subsidies of fertilizers, insecticides, water supplies, and
electricity, the yield will be higher,"" he said. ""We (also) hope
the government will increase the purchase price, because the end
benefit out of this huge piece of land is very little.""

 By Matt Scuffham
 LONDON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Online gambling firm 888
confirmed it was in talks with Ladbrokes over a possible
takeover by Britain's biggest bookmaker, sending its shares
soaring by as much as 24 percent on Monday.
 Shares in 888, which had lost around two-thirds of their
value since January, were up 18 percent at 58 pence at 1020 GMT,
having been as high as 60.75 pence.
 The Sunday Telegraph reported Ladbrokes, which has 2,700
betting shops, was lining up a 70 pence-a-share bid, valuing 888
at around 240 million pounds, at a premium of some 40 percent to
888's closing price on Friday.
Spokesmen for Ladbrokes and 888 declined to comment on the
level of the approach and stressed talks were at an early stage.
 The two held talks four years ago but these were aborted
because of Ladbrokes' concerns over the threat of possible
retrospective legal action in relation to 888's activities in
the United States prior to the industry being outlawed in 2006.
 Unlike rivals PartyGaming and Sportingbet, 888 has yet to
strike a deal with U.S. authorities to give it immunity from
prosecution. ""This may be a barrier to a bid,"" said Liberum
Capital analyst Richard Taylor.
 Collins Stewart analyst Simon Davies said a price of 70
pence a share would be well received by 888 shareholders but
also expressed concern over the spectre of U.S. litigation.
 ""We believe a 70-pence offer should be a slam dunk for (888)
investors, but see significant regulatory risk to a successful
transaction given that 888 has not procured a non-prosecution
agreement with the US Department of Justice, which represents a
potential poison pill.""
 The merger of PartyGaming and bwin, announced in August, had
been expected to kick-off a wave of consolidation across an
industry seen by analysts as fragmented, though 888 was expected
to need a settlement with U.S. authorities before emerging as a
credible candidate.
 A deal would represent the first corporate activity by
Ladbrokes Chief Executive Richard Glynn, who joined in April.
 Analysts at Morgan Stanley said a deal would be a strategic
and financial winner, matching Ladbrokes' strong sports betting
book with 888's casino offering to create a combined online
gambling business with annual revenue of around 350 million
pounds and earnings of 85 million.
 Morgan Stanley said there was potential for the companies to
save 25 million pounds a year in technology, marketing and
overhead costs. That would make the deal around 10 percent
earnings enhancing by 2012.
 In August, 888 scrapped its dividend, preferring to preserve
cash after a weak economy and competition from the soccer World
Cup sapped appetite for poker games and hit its first-half
profit.
 Shares in Ladbrokes were down 0.3 percent to 127.1 pence.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The euro hit an all-time low
against the Swiss franc and struggled versus the dollar on
Monday as investors looked for more aggressive solutions from
European leaders to the euro zone's debt problems.
 The shared currency fell to 1.2701 Swiss francs according to
electronic trading platform EBS, its weakest since the euro's
launch in 1999, as investors sought a safe haven in the Swiss
currency.
 The euro was continuing to smart from last week's Irish
sovereign rating downgrade by Moody's, and analysts said it
would continue to struggle until European officials clarify how
they will address the funding and liquidity problems of
countries whose debt burdens are troubling investors.
 ""The ratings change at the end of last week is still keeping

 He added that a swap arrangement between the European

 Analysts said the euro was also struggling after EU leaders

temporary support fund for the currency bloc's weaker economies.
 ""There's a need to address the underlying risks and

 ""Until there's more clarity on where ultimate responsibility

forecasts the euro will slide to $1.20 by mid-2011.
 On Monday the euro slipped 0.2 percent to $1.3150,
approaching $1.3125 hit in earlier trade, its lowest since Dec.
2.
 
 TECHNICAL SUPPORT
 Traders said demand for euros from Russian participants in
early European trade had run into selling by Swiss names, while
a U.S. investment house was seen dumping euros in hefty volumes.
The euro was supported against the dollar around
$1.3100-1.3090, a retracement level and its 200-day moving
average. A break below that would open the way to the 1.2960
support level, technical analysts at Credit Agricole said.
 Many in the market expect the euro to remain vulnerable into
the new year, although activity is dwindling ahead of holidays
at the end of the week in many financial centres.
 The latest FX positioning data suggests sentiment remains
negative for the euro as speculators held a net short position
in the single currency last week for the fourth consecutive
week, while net longs in the Swiss franc have increased.
 The dollar was underpinned in Asia by tensions on the
Korean peninsula. South Korea held live-fire drills in a
disputed area on Monday despite threats of war from Pyongyang,
which prompted selling of the South Korean won.
 The dollar eased 0.2 percent against the yen to 83.80 on
Japanese corporate selling, slipping further below last week's
three-month high of 84.51 yen.

inventories and quickening demand growth.
 The third consecutive month of higher poll predictions was
due to strong demand from Asia and more modest spare output
capacity growth, analysts said.
 ""We anticipate that oil prices will remain robust in 2011 as
demand from thirsty developing nations continues and inventories
are tapped,"" said Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets' senior oil
analyst Simon Cooke-Yarborough.
 Most of the 33 analysts, banks and government agencies who
contributed lifted their forecasts, with U.S. prices expected to
average $86.36 a barrel in 2011, up from $83.66 a barrel in
November's poll.
 ""As inventories decline alongside simultaneous demand
growth, possible supply disruptions due to geopolitical
instabilities remain prevalent, and OPEC keeps targets steady --
it seems higher oil prices may be on the horizon for the first
quarter of 2011 and beyond,"" said Daniel Hwang, Gain Capital
Forex.com's senior market strategist.
 Crude inventories in the world's top oil consumer the United
States fell 9.9 million, the largest weekly drop since September
2002, the Energy Information Administration's latest weekly
report shows.
 Demand will grow by 6-7 million barrels per day over the
next five years, according to Deutsche Bank's chief energy
economist Adam Sieminski, while non-OPEC supply will rise by
only 3-4 million barrels per day.
 ""Spare crude capacity in OPEC is likely to shrink in the
absence of a strong ramp-up in Iraqi production, in our view,""
Sieminski wrote in a note. ""We believe these trends increase
upside price risk over the medium term.""
 U.S. crude oil prices rose to a 26-month high of $90.76 a
barrel on Dec. 7, driven by dollar weakness and cold
temperatures in the northern hemisphere. Prices have since
traded in a range just below $90 a barrel.

 
 CHINA RATES, EURO ZONE CHECK UPSIDE
 Despite the increase in oil price forecasts, Ireland's
credit rating downgrade last week was a reminder of the
potential issues still facing the euro zone, economic recovery
and related oil demand.
 Spain also paid higher premiums to place 2.4 billion euros
of government bonds in mid-December, in the latest sign
investors remain skittish about the country's ability to manage
its fiscal affairs.
 Bullishness on further oil price increases could also find
some temperance from expectations China will act to curb
inflation by lifting interest rates.
 ""It may be the case as we move through next year (that)
crude prices wane slightly from their current levels in response
to factors such as tighter monetary policy in China and European
fiscal austerity measures, which will start to bite in 2011,""
Lloyd's Cooke-Yarborough said.
 While possible interest rate hikes in China, India and
Russia could see prices correct in the coming weeks, LBBW
analyst Frank Schallenberger expected that the strong global
economic growth of around 4 percent could push prices to new
record highs next year.

 By Walter Gibbs and Maria Kiselyova
 OSLO/MOSCOW, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Vimpelcom's $6.6 billion bid
for telecoms assets owned by Weather Investments was hanging by
a thread after Norwegian shareholder Telenor said on Monday it
would not back the move.
 Telenor's opposition to the deal -- which would see
Vimpelcom taking control of Egypt's Orascom Telecom and all of
Italy's Wind -- means all three independent Vimpelcom directors
must back the long-troubled transaction.
 The deal, which has been backed by the Kremlin, would make
Russia's No.2 mobile phone operator the world's fifth-largest.
Shares in Telenor and Vimpelcom rose on the news, signalling
continued market doubts over the merits of the Weather deal.
 Analysts said the move undermines the long-term stability of
Vimpelcom by once again pitting Telenor against its other major
shareholder Altimo -- the telecoms arm of Russia's Alfa Group
run by billionaire Mikhail Fridman. 
 The two owners fought protracted board and courtroom battles
over strategy for years before a 2009 resolution.
 Telenor spokesman Dag Melgaard said the deal did not make
""strategic or financial sense"" for shareholders.
 ""We are signalling our position, knowing there is no way
that we can block the deal (without support),"" he told Reuters.
 Telenor has 36 percent of voting rights in Vimpelcom and
three of the nine Vimpelcom board members. The deal needs six of
nine votes, meaning three Altimo board members and three
independents must back it to neutralise Telenor's opposition.
 
 DEAD DEAL?
 The acquisition also requires amendment of a shareholder
agreement between Telenor and Alfa.
 ""I think the deal is dead,"" said First Securities analyst
Ole Joergen Roed, adding that co-operation between Vimpelcom's
two main owners now looked unlikely.
 ""This is positive in the short term for Telenor by reducing
the chances of the transaction going through, but in the long
term it may create conflict among Vimpelcom shareholders.""
 Vimpelcom in October announced the proposed acquisition of
Weather from Egyptian tycoon Naguib Sawiris, its first major
attempt at international expansion since the 2009 deal which
secured Alfa's and Telenor's reconciliation.
 The acquisition has met a series of obstacles, most notably
the Algerian government's plans to nationalise Orascom's most
lucrative asset, Djezzy, despite a trip to Algiers by Russian
President Dmitry Medvedev.
 Altimo and Orascom declined to comment.
 
 BOARD VOTE
 Amsterdam-headquartered Vimpelcom is due to hold a two-day
meeting from Tuesday to vote on final approval of the deal.
 Vimpelcom said its board ""will consider the interests of all
of the company's shareholders in reaching its decision"".
 Telenor's shares were up 1.1 percent by 1542 GMT, while the
overall Oslo bourse was up 0.7 percent and the STXE 600 telecom
index was up 0.7 percent. Shares in Orascom were off 1.2 percent
while Vimpelcom rose 2.1 percent in New York trade.
 Analysts said the rise in Vimpelcom/Telenor shares could be
explained by market jitters surrounding the wisdom of the deal,
which will see Vimpelcom saddled with some $24 billion of debt.
 The Vimpelcom deal would help Orascom pay back $3 billion in
debt over the next three years and was initially seen as a way
to help it reach a deal with Algerian authorities over its top
revenue earner Djezzy, which Algiers says owes it back tax.
 Analysts say that if the deal fails, Sawiris may consider
disposing of more assets such as a stake in a Tunisian operator.
 VTB Capital analyst Viktor Klimovich said Telenor's move
could be part of a plan to get better terms from Weather.
 ""Vimpelcom's major shareholders are interested in this deal
in principle, so there could be more negotiation. In the short
term, though, this is an obstacle to the deal,"" he said.
 Telenor has in the past opposed Vimpelcom's expansion in
Ukraine, which led to a prolonged shareholder dispute, but
Klimovich said another damaging battle was not on the cards yet.
 ""Both parties have an interest in not turning this situation
into a conflict -- they will be constructive,"" he added.

(Releads, updates throughout; previous TOKYO)
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The euro hit an all-time low
against the Swiss franc and struggled versus the dollar on
Monday as investors looked for more aggressive solutions from
European leaders to the euro zone's debt problems.
 The single currency fell to 1.2715 Swiss francs according to
electronic trading platform EBS, its weakest since the euro's
launch in 1999 as investors switched to the safe-haven Swiss
currency.
 The euro was continuing to smart from last week's Irish
sovereign rating downgrade by Moody's, and analysts said it
would continue to struggle until the market receives more
clarity from European officials on how they will address funding
and liquidity issues.
 ""The ratings change at the end of last week is still keeping
the euro under selling pressure,"" said Carl Hammer, currency
strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 He added that a swap arrangement between the European
Central Bank and the Bank of England last week to boost sterling
liquidity for Irish banks underlined their ongoing funding woes
following the country's bailout last month.
 ""There is an underlying uncertainty with regards to the euro
zone which is very much in focus,"" he said.
 The ECB expressed ""serious concerns"" that Ireland's bailout
package could affect the institution's liquidity operations in
the euro zone, while the central bank's president Jean-Claude
Trichet said Dublin needed to stick ""rigorously"" to the rescue
plan.
 Analysts said the euro was also struggling after EU leaders
last week failed to come up with a substantive plan to bulk up a
temporary support fund for fiscally troubled European countries.
 The euro traded at $1.3175, after sliding to around $1.3125
in early trade, its lowest since Dec. 2.
 For the moment, the single currency was supported against
the dollar around $1.3100-3090, a retracement level and its
200-day moving average, but a break below that would open the
way to the 1.2960 support level, technical analysts at Credit
Agricole said.
 Many in the market expect the euro to remain vulnerable into
the new year, although activity is dwindling ahead of holidays
at the end of the week in many financial centres.
 The latest FX positioning data suggests that sentiment
remains negative for the euro as speculators held a net short
position in the single currency last week for the fourth
consecutive week, although lower than the previous week.
 
 DOLLAR SUPPORTED
 The dollar was supported, underpinned in the Asian session
by tensions on the Korean peninsula. South Korea held live-fire
drills in a disputed area on Monday despite threats of war from
Pyongyang.
 The South Korean won shed more than 1 percent to 1,171.90
per dollar at one point, its weakest since early September.
 The dollar eased 0.2 percent against the yen to 83.80 on
Japanese corporate selling, slipping further below last week's
three-month high of 84.51 yen.
 The dollar has been supported this month on the back of
climbing U.S. Treasury yields as bond prices have taken a
beating, but some analysts say higher yields have attracted some
investors back to U.S. debt, pushing yields slightly lower.
 JPM analysts said this may take away some support for the
U.S. currency.
""While some technical factors may have driven UST yields
higher in the past two months, these factors have already played
out and their impact may recede,"" they said in a note.
 ""Thus, they expect UST yields to adjust lower in coming
weeks. If this call is proven to be correct, it should drive USD
lower as well.""

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - World stocks held steady below a
recent two-year high on Monday while the euro hit a two-week low
as concerns over the euro zone debt crisis persisted following
last week's Irish rating downgrade.
 Tensions in Korea also made investors wary. Despite threats
of war by Pyongyang, South Korea launched live-fire drills on a
disputed island after an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting
failed to agree on how to defuse the crisis.
 Last week's five-notch credit rating downgrades of Ireland
by moody's and the absence of immediate steps from European
leaders to contain the crisis weighed on the single currency
while supporting German government bonds.
 ""The ratings change at the end of last week is still keeping
the euro under selling pressure,"" said Carl Hammer, currency
strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 ""There is an underlying uncertainty with regards to the euro
zone which is very much in focus.""
The MSCI world equity index and the Thomson Reuters global
stock index were steady on the day.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index rose half a percent, boosted by
energy shares, while Asian shares fell a third of a percent.
 Emerging stocks lost a quarter percent.
 U.S. crude oil rose 0.1 percent to $88.12 a barrel as
freezing temperatures in Europe and the U.S. Northeast looked
set to boost demand for heating fuel.
 Bund futures rose 77 ticks, with the tensions in Korea
supporting flows to safe-haven assets.
 The euro fell as low as $1.3125 before trimming losses to
$1.3160.
 ""The lack of any substantive plan to bulk up the (European
stabilisation fund) or provide an alternative crisis management
system has kept the market euro negative as the downgrades keep
rolling in from Moody's on Ireland, Spain etc,"" Lloyds TSB said
in a note to clients.
 ""While there may well be something more forthcoming over the
next few weeks, for the moment the market is likely to see this
as a green light to sell the euro, suggesting risks of a break
below $1.30 in euro/dollar this week. 
 The dollar was steady against a basket of major currencies.
 The Korean won briefly hit a four-week low against the
dollar after South Korea's drills.

 * Data shows November inflows still at high level
 * PBOC may choose quantitative tools in medium term
(Adds quotes)	
 Dec 20 (Reuters) - By Lu Jianxin and Melanie Lee	
 SHANGHAI, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Capital flows into China
slowed down in November from a near record high in October,
central bank data showed, which could reduce the need for an
imminent tightening of monetary policy.	
 The ""Position for Forex Purchases"" showed November inflows
remained at a relatively high level historically. To reduce
the prospects for speculative ""hot money"" to flow into China
in search of higher returns, the central bank may resort to
quantitative policy tools instead of interest rate increases
in the medium term, analysts say.	
 ""November's capital inflow figure has reduced the
possibility for a near-term tightening step, whether it is an
interest rate hike or a bank reserve ratio rise,"" said bond
market analyst Liu Junyu at China Merchants Bank in Shenzhen.	
 ""In the longer term, the PBOC is likely to rely mainly on
tools aimed at draining liquidity because rate hikes may
invite more speculative inflows into China while their impact
on curbing money supply is relatively small.""
The People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central
bank, and Chinese institutions spent 319.6 billion yuan ($48
billion) to absorb foreign exchange flowing into China in
November.	
 That was down sharply from 519 billion yuan in October,
the third largest since the data was published in the late
1990s.	
 But the November report, a key measure of capital inflows
into China, was much higher than the 290 billion yuan in
September and 243 billion yuan in August, according to Reuters
calculations based on the latest data published by the central
bank over the weekend.	
 Chinese interest rate swaps (IRS) and bond yields fell on
Monday in response to the capital inflows figures. Benchmark
five-year and 10-year IRS both
dropped 5 basis points. [ID:nTOE6BJ03D]	
 China has seen a steady increase of capital inflows in the
last decade as speculators bet on a rise in the country's
shares and property as well as appreciation of the yuan
against the dollar.	
 The slowdown in capital inflows in November reflected a
5.3 percent fall in the stock market in the month, following a
12.2 percent jump in October, and continued efforts by the
government to control high property prices. The yuan also fell
in the second half of November after hitting a multi-year peak
in the middle of the month.	
 
 STOCKS, YUAN FALL	
 A lacklustre performance this month by the Shanghai stock
index , which is up 2.6 percent, and a steady level for
the yuan, suggest capital inflows could remain stable in
December compared with November.	
 To clamp down on excessive inflows and calm inflation in
October, the central bank raised official interest rates on
Oct. 19 and followed that with three increases in bank reserve
requirement ratios (RRR), locking up more than 1 trillion yuan.	
 The flood of inflows into China's financial system, a rise
in annual consumer price inflation in November to a 28-month
high of 5.1 percent and the fact that real interest rates have
been negative since February argue for more monetary
tightening steps, some analysts say.	
 The central bank is now signalling, via its open market
operations, that it may rely on increases in bank reserve
requirements to tighten policy in coming weeks and possibly in
coming months.	
 The possibility of another rate rise, much anticipated by
the market, may thus be delayed not only through this year but
probably until after the Lunar New Year in early February,
markets sources suggest.	
 The central bank has kept the auction yield of its bills
unchanged over the past five weeks in its open market
operations and is expected to continue doing so in coming
weeks, in an effort to dampen expectations of another official
rate rise. ($1=6.66 yuan)

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Asian shares fell to their
lowest in over a week on Monday, led by a 2 percent slide in
Shanghai stocks as thin year-end trading made for exaggerated
moves, not helped by mounting tensions on the Korean peninsula.
The euro slipped to a two-week low after last
week's massive five-notch credit rating downgrade of Ireland
by Moody's and euro zone leaders failed to reassure markets on
how they will tackle the debt crisis in the short term.	
 With the year-end holidays looming, buyers were hard to be
found, having taken profits since Asian stocks hit 2-1/2 year
highs last week.	
 Asia Pacific stocks, as measured by MSCI
fell 0.5 percent, having earlier dropped to lows not seen
since Dec. 8, while the index excluding Japan
shed 0.8 percent.	
 Despite threats of war by Pyongyang, South Korea on Monday
launched live firing drills on a disputed island after an
emergency U.N. Security Council meeting failed to agree on how
to defuse the crisis. 


 Share markets from Australia to Singapore were all in the
red with Japan's Nikkei down 0.8 percent, Hong Kong's
Hang Seng index down 1.0 percent and South Korea's KOSPI
0.7 percent lower. Shanghai's stock index fell
1.8 percent, having earlier slid about 3 percent.	
 ""We see a typical year-end money crunch plus jitters over
continued PBOC tightening and consequently a lacklustre market
performance until early next year,"" said Shanghai Securities
senior trader Zheng Weigang.	
 Technically, the fall in the Shanghai Composite Index to
below its 250-day moving average indicates the market may
struggle in the near term.	
 Even major miners like BHP Billiton erased gains
to close lower on the day as support from higher commodity
prices faded.	
 Copper , which came within a whisker of the record
high on the London Metal Exchange, was last up 0.9 percent at
$9,145 a tonne. Earlier, it rose as high as $9,257.50, not far
off the record high of $9,267.50 set last week.	
 U.S. crude  was flat near $88 a barrel.	
 Analysts generally expect strong growth in emerging
economies to keep commodities in demand next year. JPMorgan
forecasts a 17 percent return for the S&P commodities index,
or the GSCI , over the next 12 months.	
 Despite the negative start to the week, MSCI's Asia
Pacific stock index is still up some 10 percent so far this
year, compared with a rise of around 8 percent for the MSCI
world equity index .	
 JPMorgan predicts emerging markets equities will provide
some of the best returns next year among global stocks. It
forecasts the MSCI emerging markets stock index will rise to
1,500 in 2011 from around 1,108 currently .	
 
 EURO SAGS	
 The euro plumbed a two-week low at $1.3125 was looked set
to test support at $1.3100-3090 , while the dollar edged
up 0.1 percent versus a basket of major currencies.	
 ""The dollar is generally supported this morning by
tensions in the Korean peninsula and concerns over European
debt problems,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager at Okasan
Securities. 
 ""The euro has been under pressure, especially since the
downgrading of Ireland last week. ... Selling pressure could
increase should the euro break $1.3.""	
 The dollar's upside was capped, however, as U.S. Treasury
yields retreated from recent highs. The 10-year bond yield
fell 2.7 basis points on the day to 3.311 percent,
off the seven-month peak of 3.568 percent set last week.	
 Some investors and analysts have taken a view the market
was pricing in too much economic improvement too fast,
prompting yields to ease back.

 By Chikafumi Hodo and Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The euro slid to a two-week low on
Monday, looking vulnerable to more losses against the dollar
after breaching chart support the previous session, while the
market kept watch on rising tensions in the Korean peninsula.
 The euro, which was pressured by a five-notch downgrade of
Ireland's sovereign credit rating on Friday, was within reach of
support at $1.3100-3090, a retracement level and its 200-day
moving average.
 Many in the market expect the euro to remain vulnerable into
the new year as investors await more aggressive solutions from
European leaders to address debt concerns in the region, although
activity is dwindling ahead of holidays at the end of the week in
many financial centres.
 ""The dollar has been generally supported this morning by
tensions in the Korean peninsula and concerns over European debt
problems,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager at Okasan
Securities.
 South Korea started a planned artillery firing drill on
Monday, despite threats of attack by North Korea and pressure
from Russia and China to cancel the exercise. South Korean stocks
and the won fell early in the day but later cut their losses.
 ""The euro has been under pressure, especially since the
downgrading of Ireland last week ... Selling pressure could
increase should the euro break $1.3,"" Soma said.
 The euro's November low, just below $1.2970, is seen as an
important support level.
 The euro was down 0.2 percent from late U.S. levels, at
$1.3161, after earlier slipping to a two-week low of $1.3125.
 EURO ON THE DEFENSIVE
 Those who had expected range-bound trade ahead of the
holidays, including some model players, are being forced to close
their euro long positions, traders said.
 ""Since the downgrading of Ireland last week the market has
become increasingly sensitive about debt problems in Europe,
which is keeping the euro on the defensive,"" said a Japanese bank
trader.
 Japanese exporters were also selling the euro, which helped
push the single currency to a two-week low of 110.17 yen.
 The euro also slipped 0.2 percent against the Swiss franc to
1.2750, hovering just above a record trough of 1.2720 hit on
Friday as investors continued to shun the euro.
 The dollar eased 0.1 percent against the yen to 83.88 yen on
Japanese corporate selling, slipping further below last week's
three-month high of 84.51 yen.
 It lacks the energy to rise strongly above 84 yen with many
investors in the United States and Europe expected to refrain
from taking large positions ahead of the holidays, Soma said.
 Sell orders rumoured to be lined up between 84.30 and 84.50
yen are also expected to block the topside, he said.
 However, speculators have been cutting their long yen
positions. Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed on Friday they almost halved their net yen long
positions to 12,735 contracts last week.
 Tensions on the Korean peninsula underpinned the dollar. The
South Korean won shed more than 1 percent to 1,167.90 won per
dollar at one point, near a low around 1,170 hit in the wake of
North Korea's shelling of a disputed island last month, before
later recovering.
 Still, investors are not universally risk-averse, with the
Australian dollar rising 0.1 percent to $0.9885, although it is
still off a one-month high above $1 marked last week.
 The U.S. CFTC data showed speculators increased their net
Aussie long position by more than 10,000 contracts to 53,778
contracts.
 ""The Aussie boasts the highest yield among liquid currencies,
and gold doesn't look like falling in the near term, making the
Aussie the best currency to hold during the holiday period,"" said
a trader at a Japanese bank.
 The dollar index was up 0.1 percent at 80.49.

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Asian shares eased on Monday,
lead by a 0.8 percent drop on the Seoul market as tensions
heightened on the Korean peninsula, but firm commodity prices
underpinned appetite for mining stocks like BHP Billiton.	
 Investors also gave the euro a wide berth after last
week's massive five-notch credit rating downgrade of Ireland
by Moody's and as euro zone leaders failed to reassure markets
on how they will tackle the debt crisis in the short term.	
 However, trading was light as the year-end holidays
loomed, with investors reluctant to do much, having taken some
profits recently when Asian stocks hit 2-1/2 year highs.	
 ""People have already put the cue in the rack this year,""
said Ben Potter, research analyst at IG Markets.	
 Asia Pacific stocks, as measured by MSCI
was 0.1 percent lower, while the index excluding Japan
eased 0.2 percent.	


 Japan's Nikkei shed 0.3 percent and South Korea's
KOSPI fell 0.8 percent, but Australia's S&P/ASX 200
index nudged up 0.1 percent, thanks to gains in the
miners.	
 BHP Billiton and fellow global miner Rio Tinto
were both up around 0.5 percent as copper
climbed almost 2 percent to $9,233 a tonne, within easy reach
of a record high $9,267.50 set last week.	
 Analysts generally expect strong growth in emerging
economies to keep commodities in demand next year. JPMorgan
forecasts a 17 percent return for the S&P commodities index,
or the GSCI , over the next 12 months.	
 
 WILTING EURO	
 The euro plumbed a two-week low at $1.3125 and looked set
to test support at $1.3100-3090 , while the dollar edged
up 0.1 percent versus a basket of major currencies.	
 ""The dollar is generally supported this morning by
tensions in the Korean peninsula and concerns over European
debt problems,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager at Okasan
Securities. 
 ""The euro has been under pressure, especially since the
downgrading of Ireland last week. ... Selling pressure could
increase should the euro break $1.3.""	
 Despite the mildly negative start to the week, MSCI's Asia
Pacific stock index is still up some 11 percent so far this
year, compared with a rise of around 8 percent for the MSCI
world equity index .	
 ""Equities are set to post double digit returns in 2011
driven by strong growth and continued risk premia
compression,"" predicted JPMorgan analysts.	
 ""Together with rising fears of inflation and the lack of
safety in public-sector debt, the probability is rising that
end investors will again turn to equities as the mainstay of
their long-term investments.""

 TOKYO, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The euro slid to a two-week low on
Monday, looking vulnerable to more losses against the dollar
after breaching chart support on Friday, while the dollar
struggled to hold its ground against the yen.
 The euro, which was pressured by a five-notch downgrade of
Ireland's sovereign credit rating on Friday, was within reach of
support at $1.3100-3090, a retracement level and its 200-day
moving average.
 Dealers expected the dollar to be supported by tensions on
the Korean peninsula, where South Korea plans a live-firing drill
and North Korea has threatened to strike if the drill goes ahead,
as well as by continued debt concerns in the euro zone.
 But activity is dwindling ahead of holidays at the end of the
week in many financial centres, although many in the market
expect the euro to remain vulnerable into the new year as
investors await more aggressive solutions from European leaders
to address debt concerns in the region.
 ""The dollar is generally supported this morning by tensions
in the Korean peninsula and concerns over European debt
problems,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager at Okasan
Securities.
 ""The euro has been under pressure, especially since the
downgrading of Ireland last week. ... Selling pressure could
increase should the euro break $1.3.""
 Soma said the euro's November low, just below $1.2970, would
be an important support level.
 The euro was down 0.5 percent from late U.S. levels, at
$1.3126, breaching Friday's two-week low at $1.3133.
 Demand from Japanese importers was likely to support the
dollar, with solid bids expected to emerge around 83.50 yen, Soma
said. The dollar was at 84.06 yen, unchanged from late U.S.
levels and below last week's three-month high of 84.51 yen.
 It lacks energy to rise strongly above 84 yen as many
investors in the United States and Europe are expected to refrain
from taking large positions ahead of the holidays, Soma said.
 Sell orders rumoured to be lined up between 84.30-84.50 yen
are also expected to block the topside, he said.
 The dollar index was up 0.3 percent at 80.58.

 * Kremlin to pitch MiGs for an $11 billion contract
 * Civilian nuclear deal expected to be signed
 * Russia eyes deal on 5th generation fighter
 
 By Alexei Anishchuk
 MOSCOW, Dec 20 (Reuters) - President Dmitry Medvedev will
try to convince India to buy Russian fighter planes and seal a
nuclear deal when he travels there this week for talks aimed at
boosting ties with the second-fastest growing economy the world.
 Russia was one of India's closest partners in Soviet days,
but the Kremlin will have to convince New Delhi that Moscow can
deliver on vast defence and nuclear orders in the face of
competition from the United States, Europe and China.
 Medvedev, who the Kremlin said will come with a large
delegation of business leaders, is to hold talks with Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh and President Prathibha Patil on Tuesday
and visit Mumbai on Wednesday.
 ""Russian-Indian relations have moved to a completely new
level which can be called a favoured strategic partnership,"" a
Kremlin official told reporters on condition of anonymity.
 But behind the rhetoric of expanding ties with its fellow
BRIC economy -- the term used to group emerging powers Brazil,
Russia, India and China -- bilateral trade is dwarfed by
Russia's booming economic ties with the European Union and
China.
 The Kremlin said trade with India will total $10 billion
this year while official statistics show Russia's trade with the
European Union stood at $246 billion in the first 10 months of
2010, and trade with China was $47.5 billion in the same period.
 India, watching neighbouring China's rapid strides in
defence, wants to overhaul its mostly Russian-supplied air force
and Moscow will lobby hard for India to select the Russian-made
MiG-35 for an $11 billion contract for 126 fighter jets.
 
 ECONOMIC PUNCH
 French, U.S. and other European firms are also competing for
the contracts, and U.S. President Obama is believed to have
pushed for American planes manufactured by Boeing and Lockheed
Martin Corp during his trip earlier this year.
 Geopolitically, India sees Russia as a counterweight to
China and a potential ally in Afghanistan.
 ""Russia has a major presence in Asia and if we look at our
dangerous neighbourhood, including China, we need a
counterbalance,"" former foreign secretary Lalit Mansingh said.
 But Medvedev may have a tough task convincing New Delhi to
strike more arms deals following delays on the delivery of some
Russian projects, including the Admiral Gorshkov heavy aircraft
carrying cruiser.
 Moscow-based defence analysts Cast say Russia has nearly
tripled the price and delayed delivery of the cruiser by four
years since signing the original contract in 2004.
 ""We still have problems about military supplies,"" Mansingh
said. ""Schedules are not kept and prices are not stable. Russia
needs to sort these out if it has to remain a big player in the
Indian market.""
 The Russian president will also not be able to deliver the
same economic clout his BRIC rival and Chinese counterpart
promised when he went to India earlier in the month.
 Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao agreed on an ambitious 2015 trade
target of $100 billion between the two rising Asian powers,
which have overshadowed Russia economically.
 Russia will see gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 4
percent in 2010 while India's economy will grow by nearly 10
percent, according to IMF figures.
 But Russia, the largest energy producer in the world, may be
able to take advantage of Indian growth by boosting its market
share in civilian nuclear energy projects.
 India plans to add 63,000 megawatts of nuclear power by 2032
from a current nuclear capability of about 4,500 MW.
 New Delhi is currently eyeing its nuclear pacts from
competing French and U.S. companies, and Russia's nuclear agency
Rosatom is trying to boost its profile in the Indian market with
the help of local partners.

 WASHINGTON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Wall Street banks have been
gripped by a certain euphoria in recent weeks, with their
economists touting a modest improvement in U.S. data as an omen
of more robust growth to come in 2011.
 Housing figures next week may inject a dose of sobriety
into these forecasts. Anticipation of a strong expansion,
coupled with worries about the budget deficit following a new
tax deal in Washington, have pushed Treasury bond yields that
directly affect mortgage rates sharply higher.
 This raises the concern that a still-struggling housing
sector, the epicenter of the country's worst financial crisis
in generations, may yet see further deterioration.
 With Europe still reeling from a debt crisis that just will
not go away, another bump on the road for the U.S. economy
might deprive the global recovery of not one but two key
engines.
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 A report on Wednesday is expected to show existing U.S.
home sales, which account for the bulk of the market, rose by
about 300,000 units on an annualized basis to 4.71 million in
November. That would mark a move further away from the 15-year
low seen in the summer, but it would still be a far cry from
record peaks over 7 million in 2005.
 ""We're still in an economy that isn't in a normal recovery
mode,"" said Edward Leamer, director of Anderson Forecast at the
University of California, Los Angeles. ""Unless we get housing
and construction jobs back, we will not get a robust recovery.
We will be stuck with high unemployment rates indefinitely.""
 That view contrasts with the burst of optimism prevailing
in financial markets over the last month. Some economists,
encouraged by what they see as the stimulative effects of a
fiscal agreement between President Barack Obama and Republican
lawmakers, are looking for U.S. gross domestic product to
expand more than 4 percent next year.
 For others, however, a battered housing market and bleak
job prospects are a major risk to the recovery.
 ""The U.S. economy is showing some sparks of life in late
2010,"" said Ken Goldstein, an economist at The Conference
Board, an industry-backed research group. ""The indicators point
to a mild pickup after a slow winter. Looking further out,
possible clouds on the medium-term horizon include weakness in
housing and employment.""
 A Reuters poll of more than 70 economists suggests U.S. GDP
will rise 2.7 percent in 2011, up sharply from 2.3 percent in a
November poll but still too low a level to make much headway in
reducing the nation's 9.8 percent jobless rate. For details,
see [ID:nLDE6BD0W5] 
 EUROPE'S MORASS
 Looming in the backdrop is a European debt debacle that
seems to get more convoluted by the week.
 Just two days after Ireland's parliament approved an $85
billion rescue from the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund, the IMF warned the country still faces big risks
that could affect its ability to repay the loan. Moody's, the
ratings agency, slashed Dublin's credit grade and European
banks warned of future losses on Irish assets.
 Investors' concern about the credit-worthiness of highly
indebted euro zone countries will make it hard for some states
to finance hefty debt repayments in the first half of 2011,
even as new issuance in the bloc falls. [ID:nLDE6BF219]
 Euro zone countries are expected to borrow less in the bond
markets in 2011 than they did this year, but the interest rates
investors are demanding pose a burden that may become
unsustainable for the likes of Spain and Portugal.
 Unlike in the spring, when Europe's problems disrupted
interbank lending and dented U.S. growth, such effects have not
been felt in the latest, more drawn-out round of debt
negotiations. But analysts say the threat remains very real.

 * Target debts amount to $274 bln as of Oct	
 * Currency swaps to be excluded from levy	
 * Proceeds to be used in case of FX liquidity shortage	

(Adds details, analyst's comments)	
 By Kim Yeonhee	
 SEOUL, Dec 19 (Reuters) - South Korea said on Sunday it
would impose a levy on banks' foreign debt from late 2011, the
latest capital controls it adopted to mitigate the impact a
sudden reversal in capital flows may have on its economy.	
 Domestic banks and branches of foreign banks in the
country will be levied on their foreign-currency debts in
excess of deposits, and the proceeds will be used in case
banks suffer shortage in foreign exchange liquidity in the
future.	
 Exact rates of the levy will be set later but the
government offered 0.2 percent, 0.1 percent and 0.05 percent
as ""examples"" depending on the maturities of less than one
year, between one and three years and more than three years.	
 Policymakers have primed investors for the measures over
the past several weeks and details unveiled jointly by the
country's top four financial authorities on Sunday came in
line with the market expectations.	
 ""We expect these measures to curb borrowings and improve
the soundness of financial services companies as well as
secure macroeconomic stability,"" the Finance Ministry, the
Bank of Korea, the Financial Services Commission and the
Financial Supervisory Service said in a joint statement.	
 [For FACTBOX on capital controls, double-click
[ID:nSGE6950DG]]	
 Analysts said the measures came in line with market
expectations and would not likely have a severe impact over
the coming days.	
 ""I don't see any significant market impact because traders
have already factored this kind of measure and because the
government excluded borrowings in won,"" June Park, an
economist at Woori Investment & Securities.	
 There has been talk among traders that the government may
also levy banks on borrowings in the local currency and on the
outstanding amount of unsettled currency swaps, but both were
excluded from Sunday's measures.	
 The authorities said banks' foreign-currency debt in
excess of deposits amounted to $274 billion as of October. 
 It is easily covered by the country's foreign reserves
totalling more than $290 billion but a sudden reversal in
capital could still easily hurt Asia's fourth-largest economy,
which is heavily exposed to overseas financial markets.	
 South Korea has traditionally had a bigger problem with
bank debt than other forms of capital inflows, owing to the
huge export orders of shipbuilders and therefore the deep
discount on borrowings in foreign currency swapped into the won.	
 South Korea recently imposed ceilings on the amount of
foreign currency derivative traders that banks can enter.	
 Emerging-market economies are grappling with the flood in
capital coming from the advanced economies where the still
depressed demand prompted authorities to keep the interest
rates near zero and financial system flush with eash money.	
 ""Given that capital controls are part of efforts to avoid
sharp currency appreciation, emerging countries are likely to
strengthen capital controls,"" said Park.	
 Leaders from the Group of 20 developed and leading
emerging economies sanctioned last month macro-prudential
norms by giving emerging markets the green light to use
capital controls to deal with volatility in their currencies.	
 Last week, Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor Hartadi A.
Sarwono mentioned how concerned the central bank was about hot
money inflows. [ID:nL3E6NG0UG]

1609,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2010 06:40PM ET</span>",Markets sanguine on Moody's big Ireland downgrade," By Daniel Bases and Alex Chambers
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors
Service cut Ireland's credit rating by five notches on Friday,
raising some eyebrows for its magnitude and timing, but
investors said the move was not unexpected.
 The hatchet that Moody's brought down on the rating,
cutting it to Baa1 from Aa2, did result in selling and marked
another chapter in Europe's credit crisis. But the reaction
was far from the drubbing Greece suffered when it was cut to
junk status on June 14.
 ""(Ireland) is a multi-notch downgrade, but that a
multi-notch downgrade would come was clearly indicated by us so
it should not come as a surprise,"" Dietmar Hornung, sovereign
credit analyst at Moody's Investors Service in London, told
Reuters.
 Indeed, Moody's flagged in November that it might make a
multi-notch move on Ireland's credit but that it would remain
investment grade.
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Friday he was
confident in Ireland's austerity measures but called Moody's
decision ""surprising.""
 The EU is exploring new rules to control the rating
agencies, including the possibility they would be required to
give countries three days' advance notice on a downgrade.
[IDnLDE6A4172]
 Other possible EU moves include levying multimillion euro
fines or even setting up a rival agency. [ID:nLDE6A21WT]
 ""If the regulators are successful in weaning the markets
off the drug that ratings are, then clearly the whole business
model gets called into question,"" said Gary Jenkins, head of
fixed income at Evolution Securities.
 Moody's said it may cut Ireland's rating further if it is
not able to stabilize its debt situation. 
 Hornung said he was not aware of any singular rating
movement as large as the one Moody's made.
 He rejected the oft-cited criticism that ratings agencies
are invariably behind the curve when they make their
decisions.
 ""This rating action is clearly forward looking,"" Hornung
said, referring to the incorporation of the latest debt
projections and fiscal austerity plans, plus European Union and
International Monetary fund help.
 ""We incorporate our expectations regarding bank
recapitalizations and debt-to-GDP figures in the future and
these estimates and projections inform our rating action.""
 Investors, however, are not buying Moody's explanation.
 Dan Fuss, who as vice chairman of Loomis Sayles helps
oversee $150 billion, told Reuters late Friday that Ireland's
five-notch credit downgrade by Moody's ""really lagged other
agencies.""
 Moody's move catches up with Fitch Ratings at the BBB-plus
level with a stable outlook while Standard & Poor's still has
Ireland two notches higher with an A rating but on watch for a
downgrade.
 Ireland's 10-year government debt fell 1.287 points in
price to bid 76.306, driving the yield up 23.6 basis points to
8.677 percent. The spread over benchmark German government debt
widened by 28 basis points .
 In June, when Greece's rating was cut, the spread over
German debt widened by 76 basis points, and it has moved wider
still .
 ""So in fact the ratings agencies are a little bit behind
the curve in terms of their ratings and certainly today didn't
have a profound impact on market pricing, which tells you the
market fully expected a downgrade and isn't paying too much
attention to the ratings agencies on this issue,"" said Scott
Mather, portfolio manager of the PIMCO Foreign bond fund.
 Ireland's Baa1 rating is now equal to those of Lithuania
and Russia, and Thailand, on Moody's scale, Hornung said.
 In the 10-year space, Lithuania yields 5.00 percent, Russia
is at 7.597 percent and Thailand is under 4 percent.
 ""It wouldn't be very helpful if you were just investing
based on the ratings, given the lags in ratings,"" said Mather,
who said the fund shed its Irish debt roughly a year ago.

 By Alina Selyukh
 NEW YORK, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar for a second straight week and global stocks edged lower
on Friday, weighed by renewed concerns over euro zone debt
after a multi-notch downgrade of Ireland's credit rating.
 Investors shifted into safe-haven bonds and sold the euro
after Moody's slashed Ireland's rating by five notches, warning
further downgrades could follow [ID:nLDE6BG0EG].
 U.S. Treasury securities rallied, causing yields to
decline, as the market got a boost from the Federal Reserve on
Friday with its latest purchase of long-dated bonds.
[ID:nN17112973]
 Moody's move on Ireland followed Fitch's three-notch
downgrade last week. Earlier this week, Moody's placed Spain
and Greece on a review for possible downgrades.
 ""While the Moody's downgrade of Ireland isn't any surprise,
the sheer magnitude of five notches warrants a mention. We
haven't seen anything like this since the Asian crisis,"" said
Win Thin, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman
in New York.
 ""We foresee ongoing downgrades for peripheral -- and
perhaps even some core -- euro zone countries over the course
of 2011 as the debt ratios are going to get much worse before
they get better,"" Thin added.
 World markets gained little comfort from a European Union
summit, at which leaders agreed to create a permanent financial
safety net from 2013 but provided no new measures to deal with
the immediate crisis.
 ""Everyone should be troubled with the situation in Europe,
and we don't think this the last of the news,"" said Matt King,
chief investment officer at Bell Investment Advisors in
Oakland, California, which oversees $400 million in assets.
 European banks were under severe selling pressure over
Ireland's debt situation. At the close in New York, U.S.-listed
shares of Allied Irish Bank  were down 4.6 percent to
$1.22 while Barclays  dropped 2.1 percent to $16.24.
 U.S. stock markets closed near multi-year highs on Friday,
as the S&P edged higher, but more meaningful gains may be hard
to come by in the next two weeks, which are traditionally
quiet. [ID:nN17105548]
 U.S. benchmark indexes closed mixed. The Dow Jones
industrial average <.DJI> fell 7.34 points, or 0.06 percent, to
11,491.91, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose

 EURO PRESSURES MARKETS
 The euro sank against the dollar, hitting a two-week low
after a drop below $1.32 triggered automatic sell orders.
 After a blip of positive news from better-than-expected
data on German business morale, the euro slid as low as $1.3133
on trading platform EBS , and was last down 
0.43 percent at $1.3179. A break below $1.3104, its 200-day
moving average that is deemed a near-term support level, could
lead to a further decline, traders said.
 Bolstered by the weak euro, the dollar <.DXY> rose against
a basket of major currencies by 0.26 percent at 80.392. Against
the Japanese yen, however, the dollar  softened 0.1
percent to 83.96.
 With the dollar on stronger ground, gold and oil prices
slipped. At U.S. market close, crude oil  38 cents, or
0.43 percent, to $88.08 per barrel, while spot gold prices
 climbed $6.15, or 0.45 percent, to $1375.40.
 As investors sought security in the tumultuous market, U.S.
Treasury securities rallied. The benchmark 10-year U.S.
Treasury note  was up 25/32 points in price,
yielding 3.3356 percent. The 30-year note  jumped
53/32 to yield 4.4376 percent.
 Over the last two weeks, Treasuries have been selling on
concerns of ballooning deficits, stemming from the extension of
the Bush-tax cut plan. Late Thursday, the U.S. House of
Representatives passed the deal between U.S. President Barack
Obama and Republican leaders to extend expiring tax cuts. The
measure now goes to Obama to sign into law.

 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Top U.S. and European Union
officials said on Friday that they would work together to
create jobs by promoting innovation and preventing new trade
barriers in areas like smart grid technology and electric
cars.
 The United States and the 27 countries of the EU produce
more than half of the world's gross domestic product, but have
lost some economic clout in recent years to faster-growing
countries like China, India and Brazil.
 ""In the current economic climate, it is evident that the EU
and the U.S. should give a renewed focus to their transatlantic
trade relationship to restore growth,"" European Trade
Commissioner Karel De Gucht said after the annual U.S.-EU
TransAtlantic Economic Council meeting.
 Two-way trade in goods and services between the United
States and the EU already tops more than $1 trillion per year,
and each side has about $1.5 trillion of investment in each
other's economy.
 But ""there are areas where we can work more closely
together to help further integrate the two economies and to
ensure we are taking full advantages of our synergies,"" White
House international economics adviser Michael Froman said.
 A recent study estimated that getting rid of half of the
regulatory and other nontariff barriers between the United
States and the EU would boost the EU's annual gross domestic
product by about $160 billion (122 billion euro), while the
United States would gain about $54 billion (41 billion euro).
 The two sides on Friday agreed to a set of regulatory
principles and to focus future work on a number of priorities,
such as energy efficiency, e-health, nutritional labeling,
electric vehicles and related infrastructure.
 They signed a pact to promote a common approach to
electronic health records, an area where the United States is
expected to invest about $20 billion in coming years.
 They also launched a web portal to help small and
medium-sized enterprises in the United States and the EU
protect their intellectual property rights from pirates and
counterfeiters.
 Froman also said the United States and the EU agreed there
is an opportunity in 2011 to make progress in the nine-year-old
Doha round of world trade talks, and that each side wants a
better deal than is now on the table.
 De Gucht warned on Thursday the talks could finally die of
negotiating fatigue if they are not finished soon.
 He repeated that concern on Friday, and said it was the
EU's view that a framework reached in July 2008 did not
represent a final agreement and much more work needed to be
done.

 WASHINGTON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The International Monetary
Fund said on Friday that Turkey should tighten fiscal and
regulatory policies to keep price pressures at bay, and may
need to raise interest rates if those tools do not work.
 In a report by IMF staff conducting an annual review of
Turkey's economy, the Fund said Turkey needed to keep its eye
on capital inflows that would keep domestic demand strong and
the nation's currenet account deficit elevated next year.
 The IMF said Turkey needed to take steps to curb
""excessive"" borrowing and limit the mis-allocation of resources
and pricing risks.
 ""A combination of macroprudential and fiscal tightening,
and a rebalancing of foreign currency purchases with liquidity
withdrawal, underpinned by structural reforms to improve
competitiveness, is warranted,"" the report said.
 Turkey ended an IMF standby loan program in May 2008, and
Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan told Reuters last month that
Turkey intends to repay its remaining $6 billion IMF debt by
late 2012. [ID:nLDE6A82N7]
 Unprecedented growth since 2002 has attracted massive
inflows of yield-seeking liquidity into Turkey's economy, and
the IMF staff report warned that this may make standard
interest rate tools less effective at delivering price and
financial stability.
 ""Instead, greater use should be made of instruments that
directly control the quantity of liquidity and lower the return
from financial intermediation, as communicated by the Central
Bank of Turkey,"" the report said..
 Turkey's central bank earlier on Friday said it was raising
banks' short-term lira reserve requirements and lowering
long-term ratios to extend maturities in the banking system in
a further attempt to curb ""hot money"" inflows.
 The IMF said another way to restrain liquidity would be to
limit foreign currency purchases.
 It added that the central bank should keep its options open
to raising interest rates.
 ""Conditions requiring an increase in interest rates may
arise within the CBT's policy horizon, including the need to
normalize real interest rates, particularly if direct
tightening measures are not effective in protecting the
credibility of the inflation target or preserving financial
stability,"" the IMF said.
 The Fund warned against ""excessive comfort"" with
expectations that interest rates will remain low for an
extended period.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The euro is likely to struggle
anew in the upcoming week as markets remain fearful about
sovereign debt issues in the peripheral euro zone economies,
and investors are well-advised to be short the currency going
into 2011.
 A five-notch downgrade of Ireland by Moody's and budget
warnings by the International Monetary Fund on Friday weighed
on the currency and will continue to cloud the euro's near-term
outlook.
 An agreement by European Union leaders to set up a
permanent mechanism from mid-2013 did nothing to assuage those
fears. Investors were hoping for more aggressive solutions to
address the region's fiscal crisis, such as increasing the
European Financial Stability Facility or issuing joint European
sovereign bonds.
 ""There are plenty of potential catalysts for the euro to go
lower. And we might see the euro hit $1.26 over the next two
weeks or so,"" said James Dailey, chief investment officer and
senior portfolio manager at TEAM Asset Strategy Fund in
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Dailey's firm manages assets of
around $180 million.
 Should the euro fall to $1.26, Dailey said he is looking to
cover his portfolio's short positions.
 On Friday, the euro slid to a two-week low at $1.3133
 and was last at $1.3181, 0.4 percent lower on the
day. On the week, the euro zone currency was down 0.2 percent,
although for December, it is up 1.5 percent.
 On the charts, immediate support for euro/dollar lies at
$1.3104, the 200-day moving average. Below that level, $1.2970,
the Dec. 1 low, looms.
 In the options market, risk reversals, a measure of
currency sentiment, remained skewed toward euro puts, or bets
for a currency depreciation. On Friday, the one-month 25-delta
risk reversals were at -2.375 vols , unchanged
from the previous session.
 To be fair, the option market's view on the euro has
improved over recent sessions, although risk reversals on the
euro are still way below the levels seen in mid-October, when
sentiment on the currency was its most positive.
 BEARISH EURO CALL FROM CITIFX
 CitiFX, meanwhile, has put out another bearish call on the
euro, adding a 15 percent short position in its overlay
portfolio and cutting dollar shorts to 5 percent from 15
percent. Steven Englander, global head of FX strategy at Citi,
calls this a ""significant change"" in the bank's positioning.
 Over the medium-term, Englander believes the euro zone will
be able to resolve its issues, but he says the next month may
be a ""bit rough.""
 ""The lack of liquidity as year-end approaches and the
difficulties in coming up with comprehensive solutions on
sovereign debt make us prefer euro shorts to longs for the time
being,"" Englander said.
 In the United States, there is a slew of data due next
week, all of which is expected to show the world's largest
economy is growing, albeit at a modest pace.
 Two economic indicators for November, durable goods orders
and personal income/consumption, will help guide forecasts for
fourth-quarter growth, with more positive news likely on the
consumer side.
 CIBC World Markets has recently upgraded its fourth-quarter
U.S. growth forecast to 3 percent, with the downbeat November
non-farm payrolls data looking increasingly like an outlier
amid other positive signals.
 These reports should keep a bid on the dollar and continue
to push U.S. 10-year yields higher.
 TEAM Strategy's Dailey thinks the back-up in bond yields is
a reflection of the acceleration of U.S. growth, all supportive
of the dollar. But he says U.S. Treasuries could rally next
week as investors seek to ""de-risk"" their portfolios, but by
2011, yields could rise once again. He forecasts 10-year yields
to rise to between 4 percent and 4.5 percent by end-2011.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The euro declined for a second
straight week against the dollar on Friday and may extend
losses after a multi-notch downgrade of Ireland's credit rating
affirmed the severity of the euro zone debt crisis.
 The euro slid to a two-week low around $1.3133, with
near-term support seen at $1.3104, its 200-day moving average
on electronic trading platform EBS. A break below could see the
currency retest the $1.30 level and drop toward its December
low of $1.2970, traders said.
 The euro zone single currency's slide accelerated after
Moody's Investors Service slashed Ireland's credit rating by
five notches to Baa1 with a negative outlook from Aa2 and
warned further downgrades could follow if Ireland was unable to
stabilize its debt situation.
 The Moody's news shattered optimism spurred by a
surprisingly firm German business confidence data.
 ""Moody's reminded us that a strengthening German economy
contrasts sharply with health in Europe's (peripheral) regions.
The ratings agency ... caused something of a reality check for
the euro,' said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at
Interactive Brokers in Greenwich, Connecticut.
 In early afternoon trading, the euro last traded down 0.5
percent at $1.3169 after touching as low as $1.3133 on trading
platform EBS, the weakest level since Dec. 2.
 Losses accelerated after automatic sell orders were
triggered below $1.32 and in the $1.3165-80 area, while thin
liquidity before the end of the year likely exacerbated the
decline. Leveraged accounts and a semi-official European name
were also seen dumping the currency, traders said.
 On the week, the euro was down 0.2 percent, although for
the month of December, it was up 1.4 percent so far.
 In the options market, risk reversals, a measure of
currency sentiment, remained skewed toward euro puts, or bets
for a currency depreciation. On Friday, the one-month 25-delta
risk reversals were at -2.375 vols, unchanged from the previous
session.
 To be fair, the option market's view on the euro has
improved the last couple of sessions. However, risk reversals
on the euro are still way below the levels seen in mid-October,
when sentiment on the currency was its most positive.
 NO POSITIVE SURPRISES AT EU SUMMIT
 European Union leaders on Friday agreed at a summit to try
to lengthen the maturities of new sovereign bond issues, and
confirmed that private investors will be involved in the future
euro zone rescue mechanism.
 They also agreed to set up a permanent crisis management
mechanism from mid-2013, but the news disappointed investors
who had hoped for more details and more active measures such as
expanding the European Financial Stability Facility or issuing
joint European sovereign bonds, so-called E-bonds.
 ""This is one of those half-full, half-empty days. There
were few expectations going into the summit that a
comprehensive solution to the near-term sovereign debt issues
facing the euro zone would be achieved,"" said Steven Englander,
global head of FX strategy at CitiFX in New York.
 He added that from post-meeting comments, it was clear that
the EU was not able to find common ground on how to deal with
the sovereign debt problems that are likely to emerge in the
next few months. ""The euro's ... sell-off is probably a
response to the tepid comments emerging from the meeting.""
 The euro hit a record low against the safe-haven Swiss
franc around 1.2720. It was last at 1.2750 francs, down 0.1
percent. The euro also fell to its lowest since 2006 versus the
Swedish crown and last changed hands at 9.0116 krona, flat on
the day.
 The dollar was 0.2 percent weaker against the yen at 83.87
yen, having repeatedly been unable to break cleanly above 84.50
since late November despite higher yields that were said to be
spurred by improving U.S. economic data.

 By Sudip Kar-Gupta
 LONDON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Part-nationalised British bank
Lloyds warned it would take a further hit from its troublesome
Irish portfolio as a result of Ireland's economic problems.
 Friday's update on its Irish exposure caused Lloyds' shares
to fall sharply, dragging down rivals such as part-nationalised
Royal Bank of Scotland, which is exposed to Ireland via its
Ulster Bank unit.
 Shares in Lloyds, 41 percent-owned by Britain's government,
fell as much as 6.2 percent to an intraday low of 64.69 pence.
 They recovered to close down 3.6 percent at 66.50 pence,
while RBS fell 5.7 percent. The two banks were among the biggest
losers on Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 index, which ended down
0.2 percent.
 Cornelian Asset Managers fund manager Bill Bullough said his
company was sticking to its underweight exposure to British
banks due to ongoing uncertainty plaguing the sector.
 ""The biggest problem seems to be it's unclear what exactly
is their exposure to a number of negative areas,"" said Bullough.
 Lloyds' warning over its Irish exposure also caused sterling
to fall on foreign exchange markets.
 Last month, Ireland had to seek an international rescue
package, but its continuing economic turmoil was highlighted on
Friday as credit rating agency Moody's cut the debt-ridden
country's rating by five notches.
 Lloyds said a further 10 percent of its 26.7 billion pound
($41.7 billion) Irish portfolio would be impaired by the 2010
year-end.
 According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, Lloyds is expected to
report full year 2010 pre-tax profits of around 2.6 billion
pounds. The Irish impairments could hit this figure and several
analysts said they were reviewing their profit forecasts.
 Lloyds said it would raise the level of provisions against
the portfolio and that it expected an increase in the impairment
charge relating to Irish exposure for the full year to some 4.3
billion pounds.
 The bank said this would result in an increase in provisions
as a percentage of impaired Irish loans to approximately 54
percent at the 2010 year-end.
 Lloyds was saddled with billions of pounds of losses after
buying troubled rival HBOS at the height of the credit crisis in
a rescue deal brokered by the Labour government of the time.
 The state subsequently took a 41 percent stake after
spiralling bad loans forced Lloyds into a taxpayer-funded
bailout. The bank's new chief executive, Antonio Horta-Osorio,
is due to replace Eric Daniels in March.
 In August, Lloyds said it was closing its Irish business
banking operation and would effectively be pulling out of the
country, but was still exposed to Ireland via existing loans.

 By David Mardiste
 TALLINN, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The finance minister of Estonia,
whose country joins the euro zone as newest member on January 1,
said on Friday he was against the single currency bloc issuing
its own bonds and raising the size of the bailout fund.
 Estonia enters the euro zone with the lowest level of public
debt as a share of the economy of any member and the second
lowest deficit.
 In an interview to Reuters Insider, Jurgen Ligi lined up
with Germany in opposition to a new kind of debt issue.
 ""I don't think such a regular and big instrument should
exist and...it takes responsibility off from certain countries
to solve their own problems,"" he said.
 ""Actually, I am very cautious about it and I know it is a
hot debate that can change, but I am sceptical, personally.""

 He said any idea of increasing the bailout fund should also
be considered carefully.
 ""It is a strong message for countries at home and it is a
strong message for the markets -- too many governments out of
the market is not actually a solution,"" he said.
 It could also lead to too many countries being in the fund,
reducing the number of those having to donate. ""It is a matter
of mathematics,"" he said.
 He played down the chance of a break up of the euro zone,
but said he was concerned about the effectiveness of austerity
programmes in countries like Ireland, Greece and Portugal.
 ""As a politician I can't confirm it (any talk of a break up
of the euro zone). I have not met any finance minister who could
even talk about it,"" he said.
 ""The short term concern is to convince the market that the
situation is not that bad as they tend to think if they compare
different currencies,"" he said.
 He said he was concerned about countries' rescue programmes
and austerity measures. ""Everyone has to cut, but not everyone
is able to do enough,"" he said.
 He said the main problem in Greece was public understanding
of the need for budget deficit cuts, while in Ireland the worry
was how the banks would come out of the problems.
 ""In the case of Ireland, the future is quite bright if we
take the competitiveness of the economy. In the case of Spain
and Portugal the economy should be more optimistic...if we talk
about public finances,"" he added.

 NEW YORK, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar on Friday and looked set to extend losses after a
multi-notch downgrade of Ireland's credit rating overshadowed
solid German economic data and underscored the severity of the
euro zone debt crisis.
 The euro slumped to a two-week low around $1.3130, with key
support seen around $1.3105, its 200-day moving average. A
break below could see the currency retest the $1.30 level and

 Moody's Investors Service slashed Ireland's credit rating
by five notches to Baa1 with a negative outlook from Aa2 and
warned further downgrades could follow if Ireland was unable to

 ""While the Moody's downgrade of Ireland isn't any surprise,
the sheer magnitude of five notches warrants a mention. We
haven't seen anything like this since the Asian crisis,"" said
Win Thin, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman
in New York.
 ""We foresee ongoing downgrades for peripheral -- and
perhaps even some core -- euro zone countries over the course
of 2011 as the debt ratios are going to get much worse before

 The euro last traded down 0.6 percent at $1.3151 after

 The euro had climbed as high as $1.3360 after the Ifo index

December.
 ""Overall the outlook for the euro doesn't look very
positive. Going into the year-end, we continue to favor
euro/dollar breaking lower,"" said Mary Nicola, currency

 ""If they can be proactive, that will be seen as a big

 McGrath said $1.30 will likely provide support for the near

 NEW YORK, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar and world stocks dropped on Friday, weighed by renewed
concerns over euro zone debt after a multi-notch downgrade of
Ireland's credit rating.
 Moody's slashed Ireland's credit rating by five notches,
and warned that further downgrades could follow if Ireland
didn't stabilize its debt situation. [ID:nLDE6BG0EG]
 The move followed Fitch's downgrade last week, cutting
Ireland's credit level by three notches. Earlier this week,
Moody's placed Spain and Greece on a review for possible
downgrades.
 World markets gained little comfort after leaders at a
European Union summit agreed to create a permanent financial
safety net from 2013, though the EU provided no new measures to
deal with the immediate crisis.
 ""Wall Street has reacted with trepidation to news that
Moody's Investors Service cut Ireland's credit rating with a
negative outlook,"" said Joseph Hargett, analyst at Schaeffer's
Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio. ""What's more, many
traders are disappointed with the European Union's response to
euro-zone debt issues following a two-day summit.""
 In New York trading, the euro extended losses against the
dollar to hit a two-week low after a drop below $1.32 triggered
automatic sell orders.
 The euro slid as low as $1.3138 on trading platform EBS
, and was last down 0.7 percent $1.3147.
 European stock markets followed, with the FTSEurofirst 300
index of leading European shares <.FTEU3> down 5.27 points, or
0.47 percent, to 1126.03.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> dipped

1,242.23. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 7.33
points, or 0.28 percent, at 2,644.64.
 CONTAGION RISK LINGERS
 Better-than-expected data on German business morale from
think tank Ifo temporarily bolstered the euro in late European
trade and marginally lifted gold and oil prices.
 The two commodities flattened out since then, with U.S.
crude oil  up 26 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $87.96 per
barrel, and spot gold prices  nudging 0.01 percent lower
to $1369.10.
 In currencies, the dollar <.DXY> strengthened against a
basket of major trading-partner currencies, gaining 0.5 percent
to 80.54. Versus the yen, the dollar  rose 0.01 percent
to 84.05.
 Against the backdrop of the Ireland rating cut, investors
edged back into U.S. Treasuries. The benchmark 10-year U.S.
Treasury note  was up 8/32, with the yield at 3.40
percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note  was
unchanged, with the yield at 0.64 percent. The 30-year U.S.
Treasury bond  was up 20/32, yielding 4.50 percent.
 Over the last two weeks, Treasuries have been underselling
on concerns of ballooning deficits, stemming from the extension
of the Bush-tax cut plan. Late Thursday, the U.S. House of
Representatives passed the deal between U.S. President Barack
Obama and Republican leaders to extend expiring tax cuts. The
measure now goes to Obama to sign into law.
 Even so, Treasuries attracted interest in the wake of
renewed euro zone debt concerns. ""There is a risk that the
sovereign crisis will spread across the Atlantic to the U.S.
... There's already evidence that it's turning to disorderly
unwinding,"" said David Woo, head of global rates and currencies
at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
 ""There are clearly very uncomfortable positions in the
market that will be unwound, especially if data holds up.""
 High up on investors' radar is Ireland, whose debt levels
have quadrupled since late 2007 on the back of a banking sector
meltdown.
 The premium that investors demand to hold 10-year Irish
government bonds  over German Bunds 
rose 29 basis points to 571 bps, while spreads on 10-year
Portuguese bonds  were up 11 bps to 361 bps.
 Benchmark 10-year Bund yields fell 2 bps to 3.029 percent
as investors took refuge in safer German government debt.
 The cost of insuring sovereign bonds issued by euro zone
peripheral countries rose, with the five-year credit default
swaps on Ireland widening 15 bps to 581 bps and Portuguese CDS
moving out by 13 bps to 470 bps.

pressure on the country's already-battered commercial banks.
 The ECB said its decision to set up a swap agreement with
the Bank of England would allow the Irish central bank to
provide liquidity in sterling to Irish banks in addition to
euros and dollars as is now the case.
 Irish-based banks currently account for around a quarter of
all ECB funding due to the fact that other banks refuse to lend
to them. 
 ""The agreement allows pounds sterling to be made available
to the Central Bank of Ireland as a precautionary measure, for
the purpose of meeting any temporary liquidity needs of the
banking system in that currency,"" the ECB said in a statement.
 Analysts said the move was unlikely to be directly related
to Moody's downgrade, but said it showed the unrelenting
pressure on Irish banks despite the country's recent 85 billion
euro aid package.
 ""Due to the fact Ireland and England are neighbours, it is
no surprise,"" said Natixis economist Sylvain Broyer.
 ""It shows the banking crisis is still going on and we only
have to hope the Spanish banks are not facing a similar
situation as that would be a big problem.
 ""It means that Irish banks still have liquidity problems
despite the fact they are refinancing themselves in enormous
amounts at the ECB,"" he added.
 The sterling swap deal will run until the end of September
next year, the ECB said. Unlike the ECB's usual procedure, it
will be up to the Irish central bank, rather than the ECB
itself, to carry out any operations as the money will only be
available to Irish banks.
 The ECB has put in place temporary swap agreements at
various intervals during the financial crisis. It is currently
still lending dollars on a weekly basis under a deal that runs
until the end of January according to the U.S. Federal Reserve's
Web site.
""We know the Irish banks have been borrowing from the ECB
heavily in recent months and this latest downgrade is going to
put extra pressure on the value of collateral held by Irish
banks,"" said Lloyds economist Kenneth Broux.
 ""The swap facility could help partly alleviate some of that
pressure,"" he added.

1636,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2010 10:36AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Boom years distant in Venezuela despite oil recovery,"
 * Economists foresee fiscal package, possible devaluation
 * Badly-run state firms partly blamed for high dollar need
 * Harder to generate growth than in previous years
 By Frank Jack Daniel
 CARACAS, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Falling oil production, a
nationalization program and capital flight are behind an
ongoing shortage of dollars that means Venezuela's economy will
not bounce into boom times despite a recovery in crude prices.
 Most of South America is enjoying a strong economic
recovery, with Brazil slated to grow by 7.5 percent this year,
but Venezuela remains in recession. Its economy is expected to
expand by at best a couple of percent next year, with gloomier
minds forecasting a third consecutive annual contraction and
even worrying about debt repayments.
 Predictions about the finances of the continent's top oil
exporter under socialist President Hugo Chavez often paint a
grimmer picture than reality bears out. But there are few signs
Venezuela will return to the high growth it enjoyed as oil
prices soared between 2004 and 2008.
 ""We had an incredible bonanza where people bought houses
and cars with an ease that is not going to be present in the
next few years,"" said analyst Angel Garcia of local think-tank
Econometrica.
 ""Until the scarcity of foreign currency is resolved,
economic growth in Venezuela will be compressed. There will be
years in which it grows and others when it stagnates.""
 The most pessimistic view -- that Venezuela will struggle
to cover a dollar shortfall with new debt issuance in 2011 or
2012 -- is based on a low estimation of oil exports, while more
optimistic forecasts take into account expected new crude oil
output.
 Many analysts confidently predict a devaluation of the
bolivar currency early next year as the government seeks to
increase spending and boost growth. A devaluation has the added
advantage of reducing the pressure on foreign reserves and
freeing up dollars for imports.
 However, expectations of devaluations in Venezuela have
often proved wrong in the past. But with two years until a
presidential vote where he will stand for reelection, Chavez
may well decide to take the political pain now. He is also
expected to announce several new taxes using decree powers over
the next few days.
 ""We believe that the government is trying to raise its
income in 2011 so it has a lot more spending power in 2012 for
the presidential elections,"" said Alejandro Grisanti of
Barclay's Capital in New York.
 Chavez has already said he will increase the sales tax rate
soon from 12 percent, probably by a couple of percentage
points.
 Such measures will not directly help underlying problems of
lower oil output, declining productivity in manufacturing and
industry due to poorly-managed nationalizations, low private
sector investment and capital flight.
 ""Whether you are talking about stimulus or not matters a
lot less than providing the goods needed to generate growth,""
Daniel Volberg of Morgan Stanley said.
 ""A certain level of growth in 2007 needed a smaller import
bill than it does today.""
 HOPING FOR $100 OIL
 Venezuela's currency system is fiendishly complicated, with
half a dozen different exchange rates -- an attempt by Chavez
to meet importers' demands, tame double-digit inflation and
maximize the value of oil sales while containing the outflow of
dollars.
 The country makes only a fraction of the goods that its 28
million people consume, and the dollar shortfall limits the
number of greenbacks the government releases for imports, in
turn slowing the economic recovery.
 Despite similar oil prices, imports of consumer goods so
far this year are well below 2007 levels.
 Oil makes up 90 percent of Venezuela's export income,
meaning that sliding production -- caused by an OPEC quota cut
and constant problems at its oil fields and refineries -- has a
direct impact on the country's external accounts.
 After oil prices jumped last month, Chavez and his oil
minister started calling for $100 per barrel as a fair price --
but most forecasters see crude at $85-$95 on average next
year.
 Lower production is one reason for the problem, and experts
are also at odds over how serious the dollar crunch really is
because Venezuela's accounts are opaque and oil output data is
not seen as reliable, making it hard to calculate accurate
income levels.
 But even by official accounts, crude oil production and
exports are down by several hundred thousand barrels per day
(bpd). The government says output remains around 3 million bpd,
while some industry observers say it is closer to just 2.2
million bpd.
 Production should not fall much further, however, and could
recover slightly as projects in the vast Orinoco extra-heavy
crude oil belt begin pumping oil in about a year.
[ID:nN11230969]
 One way to measure Venezuela's shortage of hard currency is
to track debt issues. Another is asset sales -- its state oil
company PDVSA sold four refineries in Germany for $1.6 billion
in October and is using the money for operating costs.
 Garcia estimates that local dollar demand outstrips supply
by 25 percent. Grisanti of Barclay's Capital predicted that
Venezuela will issue a further $10 billion in foreign debt next
year, some of it sovereign and some by PDVSA.
 Venezuela has issued $6 billion so far in 2010, with
another $3 billion expected from PDVSA before the end of the
year. The government also signed a $20 billion export loan deal
with China earlier this year. [ID:nTOE63J06H]
 Most of the bond paper feeds the government-run SITME
foreign exchange market.
 Volberg of Morgan Stanley said loose U.S. monetary policy
meant there was appetite for Venezuelan debt, which pays high
returns, but warned that could rapidly change.
 ""There's a lot of chasing for yield and Venezuela is the
highest-yielding large credit, so that helps fund this gap,""
said Volberg, who sees a dollar shortfall as big as $25 billion
next year and said such a deficit leaves Venezuela exposed.
 ""You are at the mercy of the markets. If there is a sudden
stop in your capital inflow that could be a real problem.""
 Volberg based his calculations on oil export estimates that
are at the lower end of the spectrum. Others are less concerned
about a cash crunch.
 ""We do not see any type of cash restriction event,""
Grisanti said, citing Barclay's forecast of an average crude
oil price in 2011 of $85 per barrel.
 ""With this oil price scenario it is hard to think there
will be a problem in income flow in Venezuela,"" he said.
 Mark Weisbrot of Washington's Center For Economic and
Policy Research said private investment would pick up if the
Chavez government stimulated demand with spending.
 ""Venezuela is facing the same problem as the U.S. and Euro
zone: a weak recovery and the government is not giving it
enough of a boost,"" he said, adding that the country's private
sector had overcome nationalization fears in the past.
 ""When there are profitable opportunities, they invest. The
risk of expropriation in Venezuela is still negligible.""

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar on Friday and looked set to extend losses after a
multi-notch downgrade of Ireland's credit rating overshadowed
solid German economic data and underscored the severity of the
euro zone debt crisis.
 Moody's Investors Service slashed Ireland's credit rating
by five notches to Baa1 with a negative outlook from Aa2 and
warned further downgrades could follow if Ireland was unable to
stabilize its debt situation. For more see [ID:nLDE6BG0EG].
 The euro hit a low around $1.3220, with key support seen
around $1.3105, its 200-day moving average. A break below could
see the currency retest the $1.30 level and slide toward its
December low of $1.2970, traders said.
 ""Overall the outlook for the euro doesn't look very
positive. Going into the year-end, we continue to favor
euro/dollar breaking lower,"" said Mary Nicola, currency
strategist at BNP Paribas in New York.
 An agreement by European Union leaders to set up a
permanent crisis management mechanism from mid-2013
disappointed investors who had hoped for more active measures
such as expanding the European Financial Stability Facility or
issuing joint European sovereign bonds, so-called E-bonds.
 The euro last traded at $1.3223, down 0.1 percent on the
day and near its session low of $1.3217  set on
trading platform EBS.
 The euro zone single currency had climbed as high as
$1.3360 after the Ifo index showed German business morale hit
its strongest since 1991 in December. [ID:nLDE6BG0KP]
 Selling before a central bank fixing helped to accelerate
the euro's losses in thin liquidity, traders said. Leveraged
accounts and a semi-official European name were also seen
dumping the currency.
 Boris Schlossberg, director of currency research at GFT in
New York, said the strong German data could limit the euro's
downside.
 ""Germany's financial health is absolutely vital to the
stability of the European monetary union and as long as its
economy can maintain momentum, euro/dollar's decline is likely
to be contained,"" he said.

 EU SUMMIT
 EU leaders on Friday agreed at a summit to try to lengthen
the maturities of new sovereign bond issues, and confirmed that
private investors will be involved in the future euro zone
rescue mechanism, a draft statement showed. [ID:nLDE6BG0O1]
 While officials acknowledged there was resistance to the
idea of issuing joint euro bonds, analysts said the lack of any
new insight into how the EU will address the issue of debt had
helped to sour sentiment for the euro.
 ""What we've heard from the EU summit has been lukewarm, not
as informative as some in the market were hoping,"" said Henrik
Gullberg, currency analyst at Deutsche.
 ""The euro's rally earlier this week may have been fueled by
expectations the EU would offer more clarification, and there
may be a gradual realization that that is not the case.""
 Paul Robson, currency strategist at RBS, said a bearish
euro view was also reflected in the euro crosses, with the
single currency hitting a record low against the safe-haven
Swiss franc . The euro fell to a low of 1.2720 francs
before recovering to 1.2772.
 The Swedish crown rose to its highest against the euro
since 2006 .
 The dollar was marginally lower at 84.01 yen, having
repeatedly failed to break cleanly above 84.50  since
late November in spite of higher yields on the back of
improving economic data.

1640,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2010 09:16AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Debt concerns spoil holiday cheer," By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Investors get down to the final
weeks of a year that has seen healthy gains on risky assets with
a nagging feeling that a reasonable growth profile next year
would trigger an even more drastic sell-off in government bonds.
 U.S. Treasuries have been sold off, pushing yields to a
seven-month high, after President Barack Obama reached a deal to
extend tax cuts, sparking concerns over a widening budget gap
while also boosting hopes for U.S. economic growth.
 This comes as world stocks, as measured by MSCI raced
towards a two-year high, bringing this year's gains to nearly 9
percent.
 In the week to Dec. 10, bond funds saw a weekly outflow of
$0.9 billion on a four-week average, according to JP Morgan,
while equities drew an average flow of $2.6 billion.
 The euro zone debt crisis is far from over, with Friday's
deep downgrade of Ireland's sovereign ratings fanning fresh
concerns. But the risk is for a wider contagion.
 ""There is a risk that the sovereign crisis will spread
across the Atlantic to the U.S. ... There's already evidence
that it's turning to disorderly unwinding,"" said David Woo, head
of global rates and currencies at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
 ""There are clearly very uncomfortable positions in the
market that will be unwound, especially if data holds up. There
is a 30 percent chance of a serious turmoil in the bond market.""
 Woo expects 10-year Treasury yields to rise to 4 percent by
the end of 2011.
 A shift out of government bonds to equities in itself is not
a worrying phenomenon, with investors who have a bigger risk
tolerance chasing higher-yielding assets.
 But a resulting spike in yields pushes up long-term
borrowing costs, which weigh on the ability of corporates and
governments to finance themselves.
 Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rose above 3.5
percent in the past week, their highest since May.
 ""Investors have been crying wolf about government bonds for
two years: maybe the wolf has now arrived, just as everyone has
learned to ignore the warnings,"" noted Max King, strategist at
Investec Asset Management.
 ""If bond investors switch from complacency to paranoia,
10-year yields ... could rise much further. Higher yields would,
in turn, further undermine sovereign credibility, shutting all
but the best quality borrowers out of the market.""
 JP Morgan says there is a strong relationship between past
bond returns and mutual fund flows. 
 Historically, bond fund flows turn negative when the
12-month return on the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index -- an
industry benchmark -- falls below 6 percent.
 JP Morgan expects the 12-month return to fall to 6 percent
in the second quarter, then reach 3 percent by the end of 2011.
 
 CONSENSUS TRADE
 Against this backdrop of favouring equities, the Volatility
Index, a barometer of investor anxiety, has fallen to
eight-month lows below 17 percent, approaching levels seen
before the start of the credit crisis in 2007.
 As many as 92 percent of fund managers polled by the
Association of Investment Companies thought equities will rise
in 2011 while 80 percent of them thought equities will be the
best performing asset next year.
 An overwhelming preference for equities among asset managers
does raise a risk it is becoming too much of a consensus trade.
 ""Investors will be surprised by the ability of
financially-strong, well-managed blue chips to grow sales and
profits, even in an anaemic growth environment,"" said Andrew
Bell, chief executive officer of Witan Investment Trust, which
took part in the AIC poll.
 ""However, the variable growth backdrop will not be enough to
re-float all boats so an emphasis on quality is called for.""
 Morgan Stanley's analysis based on 15 years of data shows
equities rise until government bond yields approach the level of
nominal GDP growth, at which point yields would effectively no
longer be negative and would be less supportive for risk assets.
 The bank expects nominal U.S. GDP growth of 4.5-5 percent in
2011. This leaves about 1.6 percentage points of yield upside
for equity investors before they start turning cautious.

 FOZ DO IGUACU, Brazil, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Trade talks
between the European Union and South American trade bloc
Mercosur to create the world's largest free trade zone are
going well and could conclude by mid-2011, Brazil's foreign
minister said on Friday.
 In May the two sides re-launched talks that had been on
hold for six years, with the aim of creating a free-trade zone
comprising 750 million consumers and goods trade valued at 65
billion euros ($86 billion) a year.
 ""Talks with the European Union are advancing well. There is
a new negotiating spirit, really,"" Brazilian Foreign Minister
Celso Amorim said during a Mercosur summit in Brazil's southern
city of Foz do Iguacu, the site of world-famous waterfalls.
 The economies of Mercosur, which is made up of founding
members Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, are on track
to grow between 7.5 percent and 9.5 percent this year. The
other Spanish-speaking countries of South America are associate
members.
 Venezuela, whose application to become a Mercosur member
still requires approval by the Paraguayan parliament, is taking
part in the talks as an observer.
 ""There is adequate understanding by the European Union of
the conceptual framework that Mercosur is able to accept,""
Amorim said.
 Negotiators made progress earlier this month in Brasilia on
non-tariff issues such as intellectual property rights,
government procurement, subsidies and investment rules.
 ""Issues have been resolved,"" Amorim said.
 Both sides are expected to present their tariff proposals
in Brussels in March or April next year and hope to reach an
agreement by mid-2011.

 * Canadian bond prices flat to higher
 By Jennifer Kwan
 TORONTO, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar slipped
against its U.S. counterpart on Friday morning, under pressure
from weaker commodity prices and investors, who shifted their
focus to the euro zone.
 Oil, a key Canadian export, dropped below $88 a barrel,
while base metals prices were largely steady but looked to
China demand for more direction.
 David Watt, senior fixed income and currency strategist at
RBC Capital Markets, said commodity currencies have generally
been underperforming overnight.
 ""It's not necessarily an indicator of a risk-off
environment because equity markets overall overnight were
rather flattish,"" he said.
 ""It just seems markets were more interested in other
currencies today, especially some of the European block
currencies.""
 He added investors were largely uncertain about the impact
China's tightening regime would have on base metals.
 ""In commodity currencies you need a reason to buy them and
there's not really a reason to buy them right now,"" he said.
 Upbeat German data helped the euro overcome a sharp credit
ratings downgrade for Ireland on Friday, although investors
were wary about pushing it higher while worries persist about
peripheral euro zone debt.
 ""You look at the German data and it's just going
gangbusters. It seems the worse the news is on the EU periphery
the stronger the German economy is,"" said Watt.
 At 8:15 a.m. (1315 GMT), the Canadian dollar was at
C$1.0076 to the U.S. dollar, or 99.25 U.S. cents, down from its
Thursday's finish at C$1.0059 to the U.S. dollar, or 99.41 U.S.
cents.
 Watt said he is eyeing tight technical ranges of C$1.01 to
the U.S. dollar, or 99.01 U.S. cents, and parity with the U.S.
dollar.
 Bonds were flat to higher across the curve, partly tracking
U.S. Treasuries where debt prices climbed in part as the Irish
credit rating downgrade supported flow to safe-haven debt.
 The interest-rate sensitive two-year bond edged 4 Canadian
cents higher to yield 1.657 percent, while the 10-year bond
climbed 18 Canadian cents to yield 3.234 percent.

 * Bank measures raise cost of short-term funding 
 * Lira extends three-month low
 
 ISTANBUL, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Turkish bond prices weakened on
Friday and the lira hit a three-and-a-half-month low after the
central bank cut its key interest rate by 50 basis points to
curb inflows of ""hot money"". The Turkish stock index declined.
 The central bank announced a raft of measures to encourage
investors to hold longer maturities, tame domestic credit
expansion and ultimately stabilise a soaring current account
deficit late on Thursday and early Friday.
 ""If they see no change in the capital inflows situation
they will probably cut again by 50 basis points,"" said Gaelle
Blanchard, a London-based emerging markets strategist at Societe
Generale.
 ""We are sceptical about this and we think there is really a
risk that because of this policy they may have to raise rates in
a rush next year.""
 The measures included a cut to the key repo rate to 6.5
percent from 7.0 percent, a wider spread between overnight
borrowing and lending rates, and higher required reserve ratios
on shorter-term maturities.
 The bank raised the lira reserve requirement ratio to 8
percent on deposits of up to one month maturity from a previous
6 percent. It also set the ratio at 7 percent for deposits of up
to six months' maturity, 6 percent for up to a year's maturity
and 5 percent for one year and longer.
 Higher reserve ratios will offset any additional liquidity
created by a lower interest rate. The bank said the revisions
would reduce liquidity by 7.6 billion lira and $200 million.
 The yield on the benchmark Aug. 8, 2012, bond stood higher
at 7.33 percent from a record low of 7.28 percent. 
 Bond yields rebounded on Friday after falling earlier in the
week as markets bet on speculation that the rate cut could have
been as much as 100 basis points.
 The lira extended losses to 1.5341 to the dollar after
closing at 1.5230 yesterday. The currency rose to 1.52 earlier
today. The Turkish stock index fell 0.1 percent to 64,373.26
points. 
 ""We believe scope for any further easing is quite limited
and that the central bank is playing a very risky game by
cutting interest rates when domestic demand is still growing
robustly,"" said RBC Capital Markets in a note.

 By Padraic Halpin and Jan Strupczewski
 DUBLIN/BRUSSELS, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody's
gave an emphatic thumbs-down on Friday to Europe's efforts to
resolve a debt crisis, slashing Ireland's credit rating as EU
leaders took no new action to prevent market turmoil spreading.
 Moody's cut Ireland's rating by a stunning five notches
during a European Union summit meant to restore confidence in
the euro zone by creating a permanent financial safety net from
2013 and vowing to do whatever it takes to protect the euro.
 Moody's cut Ireland's rating to Baa1, two notches above
junk, with a negative outlook from Aa2 and warned further
downgrades could follow if Dublin was unable to stabilise its
debt situation, caused by a banking crash after a decade-long
property bubble burst.
 ""While a downgrade had been anticipated, the severity of the
downgrade is surprising,"" Dublin-based Glas Securities said.
 The blow to investor confidence came as the 27 leaders
failed to agree any specific measure to stop contagion spreading
from Greece and Ireland, which have received EU/IMF bailouts, to
other high-deficit countries such as Portugal and Spain.
 ""The recent events have demonstrated that financial distress
in one member state can rapidly threaten macrofinancial
stability of the EU as a whole through various contagion
channels,"" a final summit statement said.
 The leaders spurned calls for immediate practical steps such
as increasing the size of a temporary bailout fund or allowing
it to be used more flexibly to buy bonds or open credit lines
before troubled countries are shut out of the credit markets.
 Barclay's Capital analyst economist Fabio Fois called it
""another missed opportunity to calm the markets"".
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who led opposition to those
options, sought to reassure citizens and markets, declaring: ""We
are doing everything to make the euro secure.""
 Merkel said the existing EU rescue fund was sufficient, and
she was impressed by reforms announced by Spain and Portugal.
 On the sidelines of the summit, non-euro member Britain won
support from France, Germany and other countries for a drive to
freeze the common EU budget in real terms over the next decade
to take account of national spending cuts.
 Prime Minister David Cameron said the EU's big three would
issue a joint letter on Saturday calling for a lean budget in
the seven-year spending plan after 2013, rising only in line
with inflation ""to stop this budget getting out of control"".
 ""It is unacceptable to spend more and more and more through
the EU budget,"" he said, playing to Eurosceptics in his
Conservative Party who have been disappointed that he has not
done more to confront Brussels.
 Poland, set to become the biggest beneficiary of the 126.5
billion euro annual budget, voiced anger at the move.
 
 LAST RESORT
 The European Central Bank took action to bolster its
firepower to fight the debt crisis by announcing on Thursday it
would almost double its subscribed capital.
 But analysts said this was chiefly to cover the risk of
writedowns on the 72 billion euros ($95.83 billion) in euro zone
sovereign bonds it has bought so far, not to step up such
purchases to support governments in trouble.
 At Germany's insistence, the 27 leaders said the long-term
crisis-resolution mechanism, to be added to the EU's governing
treaty, would only be activated ""if indispensable to safeguard
the stability of the euro as a whole"", making it a last resort.
 The premium investors charge to hold Greek, Irish,
Portuguese or Spanish bonds rather than benchmark 10-year German
Bunds crept up in thin pre-Christmas trading, and the cost of
insuring their debt against default also rose.
 ""European leaders failed to address the issue of debt
sustainability and possible insolvency problems prior to 2013,""
said Carsten Brzeski, senior economist at ING Belgium.
 ""Debt restructuring, a common euro zone bond or an increase
of the EFSF? None of these issues have been addressed. But they
have to be,"" he said.
 Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi told reporters the
leaders had discussed a proposal by two veteran finance
ministers for common euro zone bonds but it would take time to
convince all countries and Merkel was strongly opposed to it.
 ""I'd by them right away instead of the bonds of a single
country -- it's Europe that's providing the guarantee,"" he said.
""Merkel is very opposed, but many others are interested, not
least because Europe need only provide the guarantees.""
 The record seventh summit this year approved a two-sentence
amendment to the EU treaty at Germany's behest to permit the
creation of a European Stability Mechanism to handle financial
crises from June 2013.
 The ESM, to replace the temporary fund created in May, will
be empowered to grant loans on strict conditions to member
states in distress, with private sector bondholders sharing the
cost of any writedowns after 2013 on a case-by-case basis.
 The aim is for all 27 member states to ratify the change by
end 2012. European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, chairing
the summit, said no country would need to put it to a
referendum, removing one potential risk. Decisions will be taken
by unanimity, ensuring that EU paymaster Germany retains a veto.
 Many analysts expect Greece and Ireland to have to default
before then, but ECB executive board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi
dismissed such talk in a Financial Times article, saying the
cure could do more harm than the disease.
 There has been a relative lull in financial market pressure
in the past two weeks as investors and traders close their books
ahead of the end of the year, but analysts expect turbulence to
resume in 2011 as Spain and Portugal face refinancing crunches
and the rating agencies clearly see no diminution of risk.

 BRUSSELS, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Euro zone leaders have agreed
on how to resolve debt crises from 2013, but failed to reassure
markets about what they will do in the short-term, sticking to
what the IMF has called a piecemeal approach to the crisis.
 At a two-day summit, leaders agreed on a change to the EU
treaty to create the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) -- a
permanent financial safety net from 2013 -- that will help
countries with liquidity problems and allow for debt
restructuring of insolvent ones.
 But market concerns are focused on whether the euro zone has
sufficient immediate funds to come to the aid of the likes of
Portugal or Spain, should they need a bailout next year.
 ""The new ESM should safeguard the euro zone's financial
stability in the future. However, it is to some extent
window-dressing as it does not solve the current crisis,"" said
Carsten Brzeski, senior economist at ING bank.
 The euro zone's current fund -- the European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF) -- can borrow on the markets backed by
euro zone government guarantees and has up to 440 billion euros
to lend to governments cut off from market financing.
 But many economists believe that even though only a small
part of the EFSF's funds have been used to help Ireland, it may
turn out to be insufficient if more countries need help.
 ""European leaders failed to address the issue of debt
sustainability and possible insolvency problems prior to 2013.
Debt restructuring, a common euro zone bond or an increase of
the EFSF? None of these issues have been addressed. But they
have to be,"" Brzeski said.
 European Union President Herman van Rompuy said there was no
need to talk about increasing the EFSF now, but if such a need
arose in the future, euro zone leaders would do whatever was
necessary to ensure the stability of the euro zone.
 Economists said such declarations were not enough.
 ""The statement is full of assertions proclaiming the unity
of the EU and the success of the measures taken so far to deal
with the crisis ... but there is little in the way of
specifics,"" said Ken Wattret, chief euro zone economist at BNP
Paribas.
 European leaders have used the same phrase since May, when
they created the EFSF, but this did not prevent markets from
forcing Ireland to ask for EU help and from Portuguese and
Spanish bond yields being driven to record highs.
 While a pre-Christmas market lull may have led to a
temporary truce in the onslaught against peripheral euro zone
debt, ratings agencies have been busy flagging up the fact that
risks are undiminished.
 Moody's slashed Ireland's credit rating by five notches on
Friday, having said on Thursday it may downgrade Greece. It
delivered the same warning to Spain on Wednesday, although it
said it did not expect Madrid to have to resort to a bailout as
Greece and Ireland have.
 Rival agency Standard & Poor's said this week it may cut
Belgium's debt rating if the country's inability to form a
government threatened deficit- and debt-reduction goals.
 
 A MISSED OPPORTUNITY 
 ""We believe financial markets are likely to be disappointed
by ... the overall silence regarding other proposals made in the
run-up to the summit, such as the upsizing of the EFSF and
E-bonds,"" said Frank Engels, economist at Barclays Capital. 
 ""The preliminary outcome of the EU summit ... represents yet
another missed opportunity by European policymakers to
forcefully address investor concerns and calm markets in a more
sustainable and pre-emptive manner,"" Engels said.
 The EU method of responding to new developments in the debt
crisis only when they appear, rather than getting ahead of the
curve, is seen by the IMF as one of Europe's main shortcomings.
 ""I am worried, and that's why I am urging the Europeans ...
to provide a comprehensive solution because this piecemeal
approach ... obviously doesn't work,"" IMF head Dominique
Strauss-Kahn told Reuters on Thursday. ""The markets are just
waiting for what's next.""
 Policymakers have been informally discussing various options
from boosting the effective lending capacity of the EFSF through
tweaking its operating criteria, to doubling its total size.
 Further informal ideas include higher lending to the IMF to
increase its involvement in euro zone rescue plans and extending
stand-by credit lines by the EFSF to governments whose borrowing
costs are rising, but which are not yet cut off form markets.
 Some in the euro zone back the idea of a common euro zone
bond but Germany has publicly opposed the idea and is against
increasing the size of the EFSF as both moves would be difficult
to sell to German voters angry at bailouts.
 ""Germany's rejection of the expansion is another example of
how euro zone governments do not agree on the best way forward
to deal with this crisis,"" said BNP Paribas' Wattret.
 ""As a result, the measures taken have been piecemeal,
unconvincing and reactive rather than pre-emptive. This is going
to have to change if confidence is to be restored in a lasting
way,"" he said.
 Economists also said the leaders' decision to conduct new
stress tests of euro zone banks, to help restore confidence in
the financial sector, was undermined by the lack of credibility
of the last such exercise in July.
 ""Given the erosion of credibility of the first stress test
results following the problems that emerged at Irish banks
thereafter even though these banks had successfully passed the
stress tests, we believe this news will not have any notable
market impact for the time being,"" said Barclays Engels.

 By Anirban Nag and Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The euro relinquished gains on
Friday, unable to sustain gains made on upbeat German data as a
sharp downgrade of Ireland's credit rating reminded investors
that some euro zone countries continue to face debt problems.
 Investors sold the euro as EU leaders confirmed some details
of a future euro zone rescue mechanism which were widely in line
with expectations. This disappointed some in the market
expecting more active measures to deal with weak countries.
 Selling demand before a central bank fixing helped to
accelerate the euro's losses in thin liquidity, after it rallied
mildly on the back of the influential German Ifo business index,
which came in much stronger than forecast.
 ""The euro has received a short-term boost from those Ifo
numbers, but then Germany was never the problem in the euro
zone,"" said Ian Stannard, senior currency strategist at BNP.
 ""The peripheral debt issue is a bigger problem.
 Gains made on the data were limited, and the euro was unable
to break above key technical resistance. Traders cited leveraged
accounts and a semi-official European name dumping the single
currency, knocking it to a session trough.
 The euro traded at $1.3265, up 0.2 percent on the day but
well off $1.3358 touched after the Ifo index. Its early rally
petered out before the single currency could breach its 100-day
moving average at $1.3363.
 The euro struggled after Moody's slashed Ireland's sovereign
rating by five notches, to Baa1 from Aa2, and warned further
downgrades could follow if Dublin is unable to stabilise its
debt situation.
 Paul Robson, currency strategist at RBS, said a bearish euro
view was being expressed through the euro-crosses, with the
single currency hitting a record low against the safe-haven
Swiss franc. The euro fell to a low of 1.2720 francs, before
recovering to 1.2772 francs.
 The Swedish crown rose to its highest against the euro since
2006 on Friday. The euro fell to 8.9967 crowns.
 
 EU SUMMIT
 EU leaders on Friday agreed at a summit to try to lengthen
the maturities of new sovereign bond issues, and confirmed that
private investors will be involved in the future euro zone
rescue mechanism, a draft statement showed..
 While officials acknowledged there was resistance to the
idea of issuing joint euro bonds, analysts said the lack of any
new insight into how the EU will address the issue of debt had
helped to sour sentiment for the euro.
""What we've heard from the EU summit has been lukewarm, not
as informative as some in the market were hoping,"" said Henrik
Gullberg, currency analyst at Deutsche.
 ""The euro's rally earlier this week may have been fuelled by
expectations the EU would offer more clarification, and there
may be a gradual realisation that that is not the case.""
 Losses in the euro helped the dollar to trim early losses,
but persistently high U.S. Treasury yields were expected to
limit some of the upside in the U.S. currency, with investors in
consolidation mode as operations wind down for the year-end.
 The dollar fell against the safe-haven Swiss franc, to
0.9591 francs, reinforcing a view that sovereign debt problems
within the G-4 remain dominant.
 The dollar was marginally lower at 83.90 yen, having
repeatedly failed to break cleanly above 84.50 yen since late
November, in spite of higher yields on the back of improving
economic data.

 BRUSSELS, Dec 17 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
said on Friday that Europe will do everything to secure the
stability of the euro, which has come under pressure in the euro
zone debt crisis.
 She added that reform and stability will remain on the euro
zone's agenda next year as the bloc fights to secure the single
currency and make its economies more competitive.
 ""We will do everything to secure the financial stability of
the euro as a whole,"" Merkel said at a news conference after a
European Union summit. 
 EU leaders have spent most of 2010 trying to come up with
successful measures to stop the region's debt crisis spreading,
but Greece and Ireland have already been forced to seek EU
bailouts and Portugal, Spain, Belgium and others are now in the
spotlight. 
 Merkel said she was impressed with the reforms implemented
by Spain and Portugal.
 Meeting in Brussels, EU leaders agreed to try to lengthen
the maturities of new sovereign bond issues and confirmed that
private investors would be involved in the future euro zone
rescue mechanism, a draft summit statement showed.
 On Thursday, they finalised plans for a permanent 750

Merkel said the fund would be sufficiently large.
 ""The more coherent economic policies are, the more we see by
2013 that states have made progress with a culture of stability,
the lower the financial extent of the (rescue fund) will have to
be,"" she added.
 Merkel declined to comment on whether a discussion on
proposals to issue joint euro bonds would continue. 
 She also told a news conference that the crisis mechanism
was an expression of solidarity.

 * French power grid, railways targeted for cables

 By Marion Douet
 PARIS, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Record copper prices have caused a
surge in theft of the metal in France, prompting rail and power
companies to rethink security or consider switching to fibre
optics to stop cables ending up on the black market.
 The number of thefts of objects containing copper rose by
123 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2010, according
to police figures, while rail operator SNCF says such thefts on
its network between January and October were 180 percent higher
than in the whole of 2009.
 ""The thefts faithfully reflect prices,"" Colonel Stephane
Ottavi, head of the police agency that covers such crime, told
Reuters. ""By the end of September the number of offences was
already well above the record level of 2008.""
 International copper prices have soared this year due to
tightening supply and strong demand led by China, with benchmark
three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME)
on Tuesday hitting the latest in a series of records at
$9,267.50 a tonne.
 The amount of copper stolen is often modest and the reward
for thieves only a few hundred euros, but the cost to companies
of repairs and from the disruption caused can be considerable.
 Reseau ferre de France (RFF), which manages tracks and
overhead cables for the SNCF, estimates this year's thefts on
the railways represent a cost of 10 million euros ($13 million)
in materials.
 ""That's why we are now studying the possibility of using
other materials instead of copper, such as optical fibre,"" an
RFF spokeswoman said.
 This would be more costly initially but could make sense in
the longer term if the fibre did not have to be replaced, she
added.
 Another major target for copper thieves has been the power
lines and transformers of the electricity grid.
 
 INCREASED SURVEILLANCE
RTE, the unit of power group EDF that runs the grid, has
spent 4 million euros over the past two years testing video
surveillance at its 2,000 transformers.
 On the railways, RFF and the SNCF say they have been
studying measures to monitor their 53,000 km of track on the
ground and from the air.
 The police say reinforcing security appears to deter
offenders, who may then target less-protected households, but
high prices still tempt copper thieves to take extreme risks.
 On Monday, a 29-year-old man was electrocuted at the base of
a pylon in Corsica, according to local police, who said they
found about 50 kg of copper in his car.
 As close surveillance of vast infrastructure networks is
impractical, companies are examining other alternative ideas.
 Michel Dubrueil, head of transport at RTE, said the grid
operator was looking at a redesign whereby ""copper cables are
laid in concrete during repairs or the construction of
transformers.""
 With prices firm, thieves in Europe have been stealing other
industrial metals for sale as scrap.
 This month the Church of England said thieves were targeting
lead roofs on church buildings and about 8,000 insurance claims
have been made for lead theft worth about 23 million pounds
($35.93 million) during the past three years.
 In many cases, churches have replaced their roofs only to be
targeted again, in one case 14 times.

 By Padraic Halpin and Jan Strupczewski
 DUBLIN/BRUSSELS, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody's
gave a resounding thumbs-down on Friday to Europe's efforts to
resolve a rolling debt crisis, slashing Ireland's credit rating
by five notches despite this month's EU/IMF bailout.
 The rare steep downgrade came during a European Union summit
intended to restore market confidence by creating a permanent
financial safety net for the euro zone from 2013 and by vowing
to do whatever it takes to preserve the single currency.
 Moody's cut Ireland's rating to Baa1 with a negative outlook
from Aa2 and warned further downgrades could follow if Dublin
was unable to stabilise its debt situation, caused by a banking
crash after a decade-long property bubble burst.
 ""While a downgrade had been anticipated, the severity of the
downgrade is surprising,"" Dublin-based Glas Securities said.
 News of the latest blow to confidence broke as the 27
leaders held a second day of talks on how to stop contagion
spreading from Greece and Ireland to other high-deficit euro
zone countries such as Portugal and Spain.
 ""The recent events have demonstrated that financial distress
in one member state can rapidly threaten macrofinancial
stability of the EU as a whole through various contagion
channels,"" a draft final summit statement seen by Reuters said.
 At their first session on Thursday, the leaders spurned
calls for immediate practical steps such as increasing the size
of a temporary bailout fund or allowing it to be used more
flexibly to buy bonds or open credit lines before troubled
countries are shut out of the credit markets.
 Barclay's Capital analyst economist Fabio Fois called it
""another missed opportunity to calm the markets"".
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who led opposition to those
options, sought to reassure citizens and markets on Friday,
declaring: ""We are doing everything to make the euro secure.""
 Merkel said the existing EU rescue fund was sufficient, and
she was impressed by reforms announced by Spain and Portugal.
 On the sidelines of the summit, non-euro member Britain won
support from France, Germany and other countries for a drive to
freeze the common EU budget in real terms over the next decade
to take account of national spending cuts.
 Diplomats said Prime Minister David Cameron presented a
letter to EU leaders calling for a lean budget in the bloc's
next seven-year spending plan after 2013, rising only in line
with inflation. Poland, set to become the biggest beneficiary of
the 126.5 billion euro annual budget, voiced anger at the move.
 
 LAST RESORT
 The European Central Bank took action to bolster its
firepower to fight the debt crisis by announcing on Thursday it
would almost double its subscribed capital.
 But analysts said this was chiefly to cover the risk of
writedowns on the 72 billion euros ($95.83 billion) in euro zone
sovereign bonds it has bought so far, not to step up such
purchases to support governments in trouble.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet told reporters the central
bank's governing council thought it was appropriate to make
""additional provisioning"" -- a veiled reference to potential
losses on euro zone sovereign bonds.
 At Germany's insistence, the 27 leaders said the long-term
crisis-resolution mechanism, to be added to the EU's governing
treaty, would only be activated ""if indispensable to safeguard
the stability of the euro as a whole"", making it a last resort.
 The premium investors charge to hold Greek, Irish,
Portuguese or Spanish bonds rather than benchmark 10-year German
Bunds crept up in thin pre-Christmas trading, and the cost of
insuring their debt against default also rose.
 ""European leaders failed to address the issue of debt
sustainability and possible insolvency problems prior to 2013,""
said Carsten Brzeski, senior economist at ING Belgium.
 ""Debt restructuring, a common euro zone bond or an increase
of the EFSF? None of these issues have been addressed. But they
have to be,"" he said.
 A French delegation source said the leaders had touched on a
proposal by two veteran finance ministers for common euro zone
bonds, strongly opposed by Merkel, but there was no consensus to
take it forward.
 The record seventh summit this year approved a two-sentence
amendment to the EU treaty at Germany's behest to permit the
creation of a European Stability Mechanism to handle financial
crises from June 2013.
 The ESM, to replace the temporary fund created in May, will
be empowered to grant loans on strict conditions to member
states in distress, with private sector bondholders sharing the
cost of any writedowns after 2013 on a case-by-case basis.
 The aim is for all 27 member states to ratify the change by
end 2012. European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, chairing
the summit, said no country would need to put it to a
referendum, removing one potential risk. Decisions will be taken
by unanimity, ensuring that EU paymaster Germany retains a veto.
 Many analysts expect Greece and Ireland to have to default
on their debts before then, but ECB executive board member
Lorenzo Bini Smaghi dismissed such talk in a Financial Times
article, saying the cure could do more harm than the disease.
 The EU, together with the IMF, set up a 750 billion euro ($1
trillion) EFSF loan pool to help highly indebted euro zone
states unable to finance themselves in volatile markets.
 There has been a relative lull in financial market pressure
in the past two weeks as investors and traders close their books
ahead of the end of the year, but analysts expect turbulence to
resume in 2011 as Spain and Portugal face refinancing crunches
and the rating agencies clearly see no diminution of risk.
 On Thursday, Moody's highlighted investor fears about the
first country to receive an EU/IMF rescue by saying it was
putting Greece under review for a downgrade, due to uncertainty
over its ability to cut debt.
 Earlier this week, Moody's put Spain's debt on review for a
possible downgrade and Standard & Poor's said it may cut
Belgium's debt rating next year.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Upbeat German data helped the
euro overcome a sharp credit ratings downgrade for Ireland on
Friday, although investors were wary about pushing it higher
while worries persist about peripheral euro zone debt.
 Moody's slashed Ireland's sovereign rating by five notches,
to Baa1 from Aa2, and warned further downgrades could follow if
Dublin is unable to stabilise its debt situation. [ID:nLDE6BG0EG
 The move followed a downgrade by Fitch Ratings last week and
served as a reminder to investors that the single currency's
sovereign debt-related woes are far from over.
 The euro fell on the ratings downgrade, but recouped those
losses after the influential German Ifo business index came in
much stronger than forecast across the board... Many believe the
euro's bounce is temporary, however, and it is expected to face
resistance at its 100-day moving average, of $1.3363 on Friday.
 ""The euro has received a short term boost from those Ifo
numbers, but then Germany was never the problem in the euro
zone,"" said Ian Stannard, senior currency strategist at BNP.
 ""The peripheral debt issue is a bigger problem.
 ""Any bounce in the euro should be a good selling
opportunity. We see the euro heading lower into the year-end
perhaps to the $1.30 area,"" Stannard said.
 The euro was up 0.7 percent at $1.3332, recovering from a
low of $1.3289 hit after the Moody's downgrade of Irish debt.
Traders said there was demand from African sovereign names, as
well as Russian entities.
 Paul Robson, currency strategist at RBS, said a bearish euro
view was being expressed through the euro-crosses, with the
single currency hitting a record low against the safe-haven
Swiss franc. The euro fell to a low of 1.2720 francs, before
recovering to 1.2772 francs.
 The Swedish crown also rose to its highest level against the
euro since 2006 on Friday. The euro fell to 8.9805 to the crown
before rising to 9.0277.
 ""It is that time when year-end considerations are at play,""
said Robson. ""The real impact on the euro of all this ratings
chatter will gradually be felt in January.""
 The euro's rise came as EU leaders agreed at a summit to
try to lengthen the maturities of new sovereign bond issues, and
confirmed that private investors will be involved in the future
euro zone rescue mechanism, a draft statement showed on Friday.
 On Thursday, the leaders decided to make minor changes to
the group's governing treaty to establish a permanent mechanism
from mid-2013 to resolve sovereign debt problems.. They also
vowed to ensure adequate rescue funds, if needed..
 
 DOLLAR PAUSES
 As the euro bounced, the dollar paused after oversold U.S.
Treasuries gained a bit of ground, taking the benchmark yield
off this week's highs.
 ""For the nearer term, European policymakers still have much
work to do and the run of slightly better U.S. data can keep the
dollar supported,"" said Chris Turner, chief currency strategist
at ING.
 The dollar's failure to push through the top of this month's
trading ranges against the euro and yen has left the market in
consolidation mode as operations wind down for the year-end. 
 The dollar also fell against the safe-haven Swiss franc, to
0.9591 Swiss francs, reinforcing a view that sovereign debt
problems within the G-4 remain dominant, although traders said
volumes were thin.
 The dollar was marginally lower at 83.90 yen, having
repeatedly failed to break cleanly above 84.50 yen since late
November, in spite of higher yields on the back of improving
economic data.
 Market attention will continue to focus on U.S. Treasury
yields into the new year. The benchmark 10-year yield hit a
seven-month peak on Thursday of 3.57 percent but has pulled back
since then, making traders wonder whether a sharp sell-off is
coming to an end.

 ZURICH, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The Swiss economy is seen growing
1.9 percent next year, when the central bank is also expected to
undertake its first interest rate hike since the global
financial crisis, Switzerland's main economic research institute
said.
 The Zurich-based KOF institute, which also publishes a
monthly economic barometer, on Friday revised its quarterly view
up from an earlier forecast of 1.8 percent.
 Growth would be underpinned by higher private consumption,
investment in construction and machinery, and exports, it said.
 ""The KOF assumes that the Swiss National Bank (SNB) will
raise interest rates slightly in mid-2011. Evidence for a housing
bubble has not intensified,"" it said in a statement.
 Real estate prices in Zurich and Geneva have risen strongly
and the SNB has warned banks of lax lending standards.
 ""In addition, the Swiss franc is under continuous upward
pressure as a result of fiscal problems within the euro area,""
the KOF also said. ""Therefore, it can be expected that the SNB
will not speed up its return to a normal monetary policy.""
 On Thursday, the SNB, which forecasts growth of around 1.5
percent for 2011, kept its benchmark interest rate ultra low
despite the economy's brisk recovery as the euro zone debt
crisis has pushed up the franc and hit exporters.
 The SNB's benchmark has been at a rock-bottom 0.25 percent
since March 2009.
 The KOF, which expects the unemployment rate to ease further
to 3.3 percent, said exports were expected to rise by 3.2
percent overall in 2011 despite the strong franc.
 ""Asian economies are expected to continue to grow robustly
thereby at least partly counterbalancing decreased demand in
Europe and America,"" it said.
 The euro zone is Switzerland's biggest trading partner and
the safe-haven Swiss franc has risen some 14 percent against the
euro so far this year.

 DUBLIN/BRUSSELS, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody's
gave a resounding thumbs-down on Friday to Europe's efforts to
resolve a rolling debt crisis, slashing Ireland's credit rating
by five notches despite an EU/IMF bailout.

Portuguese or Spanish bonds rather than benchmark 10-year German
Bunds crept up further on Friday in thin pre-Christmas trading.

 The decision not to enlarge or even discuss enlarging the
existing fund could be taken by financial markets as a sign of
division, potentially provoking more market uncertainty.
 ""The decision taken was that there will be no enlargement or
deepening of the funding means at the disposal of the EFSF,""
said Luxembourg's Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, referring
to the existing European Financial Stability Fund.
 A French delegation source said the leaders also touched on
Juncker's proposal for common euro zone bonds, strongly opposed
by Merkel, but there was no consensus to take it forward.
 The leaders -- holding a record seventh summit this year --
approved a two-sentence amendment to the EU treaty at Germany's
behest to permit the creation of a European Stability Mechanism
to handle financial crises from June 2013.
 The ESM, to replace the temporary European Financial
Stability Facility created in May, will be empowered to grant
loans on strict conditions to member states in distress, with
private sector bondholders sharing the cost of any writedowns.
 The aim is for all 27 member states to ratify the change by
end 2012. European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, chairing
the summit, said no country would need to put it to a
referendum, removing one potential risk. Decisions will be taken
by unanimity, ensuring that EU paymaster Germany retains a veto.
 The EU, together with the IMF, set up a 750 billion euro ($1
trillion) EFSF loan pool to help highly indebted euro zone
states unable to finance themselves in volatile markets.
 There has been a relative lull in financial market pressure
in the past two weeks as investors and traders close their books
ahead of the end of the year, but analysts expect turbulence to
resume in 2011 as Spain and Portugal face refinancing crunches
and the rating agencies clearly so no diminution of risk.
 On Thursday, Moody's highlighted investor fears about the
first country to receive an EU/IMF rescue by saying it was
putting Greece under review for a downgrade, due to uncertainty
over its ability to cut debt.
 Earlier this week, Moody's put Spain's debt on review for a
possible downgrade and Standard & Poor's said it may cut
Belgium's debt rating next year.
 Throughout 2010, EU leaders have struggled to show unity and
clear communication in handling the crisis, alternating between
rushing out half-formed or contradictory proposals and dithering
on the right course of action while markets burned.

1660,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2010 04:36AM ET</span>",Q+A-Indonesia to keep luring emerging market investors," By Neil Chatterjee	
 JAKARTA, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Indonesia's stock market
rallied to a record high this month, while net foreign
ownership of the country's government debt is also at a
record, as investors are attracted by strong growth and
political stability. 
Here are some questions and answers on why Indonesia is a
favourite with emerging market investors. 
 
WHY INDONESIA? 
Indonesia showed resilience during the financial crisis.
Its economy should expand around 6 percent next year, slower
than China or India, but maintaining 2010's steady growth. 
The economy is being driven by exports of resources such as
palm oil and coal, for which global demand is picking up, plus
a growing base of young consumers buying cars and mobile
phones in the world's fourth most populous nation. 
Its lack of reliance on exports, in contrast to Asian peers
Malaysia and Taiwan, means investors can bet on a growth story
that will be relatively decoupled from the slow growth in
Europe and the United States. 
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was re-elected last
year, boosting investor confidence. While progress on his
promise to combat graft and on other institutional
investor-friendly reforms has been limited, the police have
containing the threat from militants while the government's
debt levels have fallen.	
 Debt is seen at 27 percent of GDP this year compared with
about 80 percent in 2001, according to data from Bank Danamon. 
That's led to credit rating upgrades: Fitch in January
rated Indonesia one notch below the coveted investment grade,
which would put it on a par with BRIC nations and allow many
institutional investors who avoid junk bonds to invest. Many
economists and the government see investment grade in 2011. 
Total returns from owning Indonesian bonds in dollar terms
have been a mouthwatering 20 percent after 40 percent returns
last year, while the stock market has climbed over 40
percent this year, after last year's 87 percent rally. And a
strengthening rupiah , up over 4 percent, boosts local
currency assets. 
 
WHAT ARE INVESTORS BUYING? 
Investors are buying banks and consumer stocks. Top vehicle
seller PT Astra International , cigarette firm PT
Gudang Garam and noodle maker PT Indofood Sukses
Makmur have all outperformed the index. 
 PT Bank Negara Indonesia is the top performing
major bank, up over 100 percent this year. Its valuation is
still reasonable at a price-to-book of 2.2, versus 4.9 for
PT Bank Central Asia , the largest lender by value.	
 Demand for new listings is expected to stay strong in a
relatively small market. With firms looking to take advantage
of the rally, 2011 will see more offerings such as state
carrier Garuda and U.S. miner Newmont's local unit.	
 Indonesian stocks saw net foreign buying of $2.3 billion
this year up to Dec 14, more than double the last year's net
inflows of $936 million, according to Thomson Reuters data.	
 The central bank's short-term debt paper, or SBIs, has
also been an investor favourite, paying a juicy 6 percent, but
the central bank in recent months has stopped issuing the
lowest one- and three-month tenors and imposed a 28-day
holding period, cutting liquidity and pushing investors
towards longer tenors or government debt, and this trend is
likely to continue. 
 While bond yields have risen in recent weeks mirroring a
broad rise across Asia as some investors took profits into the
year-end, net foreign holdings have risen to a record 196
trillion rupiah, or above 30 percent of all tradeable debt,
suggesting much of the money invested is staying put.	
 In a sea change from recent years, foreigners have been
big buyers of longer-term debt, snapping up 10 to 20 year
papers as low interest rates and ample liquidity encouraged
offshore buyers to add duration.	
Ten-year bonds offer a yield of 7.74 percent,
0.6 percentage points above equivalent Mexican debt
and 3.8 percentage points over Thai bonds
. 
Foreign direct investment is also picking up and is
expected to grow slightly next year to over $14 billion, led
by North Asian firms. There are also tentative signs more
Western firms are willing to take the risk, after many have
been put off for years by corruption, poor infrastructure and
red tape. 
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS? 
For stocks, valuations are looking expensive, particularly
for banks, and the index's PE ratio is at 16.4, above
Bangkok's 12.9, Hong Kong's 14.1 and Turkey's 9.6. 
Corporate governance is another risk. Regulators earlier
this year queried the financial reports of top coal miner Bumi
Resources and other firms controlled by the powerful
Bakrie family. Bumi's stock slid around 30 percent by mid-year
though has since recovered.	
 For bond investors, there is still the risk that the
central bank will misjudge inflation, historically the
Achilles heel. Inflation accelerated to above the central
bank's upper target of 6 percent last month, and could pick up
further in coming months on higher food and electricity prices.	
 The central bank sees rate hikes as a policy of last
resort as it fears attracting greater capital inflows, but
most economists expect a rate hike by the second quarter.	
 If earlier or steeper rate hikes look more likely, this
could cut demand for dated bonds and hurt the rupiah. Another
factor that could inhibit fresh inflows next year is if U.S.
Treasury yields continued to rise at a sharp pace, which would
diminish the relative allure of these bonds given spreads over
Treasuries would be at tighter levels.

* Euro lifted by German business sentiment
 * Weaker dollar boosts commodities
 
 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - World stocks advanced on Friday,
partly lifted by firmer commodities as the dollar fell, while
Irish and Portuguese bond yields rose after Moody's Investors
Service cut Ireland's rating by five notches.
 The euro, however, rose against the dollar after German
business morale rose to its strongest level since 1991 in
December, boosted by an increasingly strong domestic sector that
is helping the economy power ahead of weaker euro zone peers.
 The cut put Ireland's debt rating at Baa1, the third last
investment grade rank, and the ratings agency warned further
downgrades could follow if Dublin was unable to stabilise its
debt situation.
 There was little comfort for markets from a European Union
summit that agreed on Thursday to create a permanent financial
safety net from 2013 but provided no new measures to deal with
the immediate crisis.
 Ireland's debt levels have quadrupled since late 2007 on the
back of a banking sector meltdown, and it needs solid economic
growth to ensure it can meet repayments and fiscal targets set
down in the 85 billion euros EU/IMF bailout agreed last month.
 ""The Irish downgrade was significant and severe,"" said Nick
Stamenkovic, bond strategist at RIA Capital Markets in
Edinburgh.
 Last week, Fitch Ratings became the first ratings agency to
strip Ireland of its ""A"" credit status, cutting it by three
notches to BBB-plus following the bailout.
 Stamenkovic said the market had got other euro zone
peripheral countries, such as Spain and Portugal, in its sight.
 The premium investors demand to hold 10-year Irish
government bonds over German Bunds rose 29 basis points to 571
bps, while spreads on 10-year Portuguese bonds were up 11 bps to
361 bps.
 Benchmark 10-year Bund yields fell 2 bps to 3.029 percent as
investors took refuge in safer German government debt, and gold
rose 0.3 percent.
 The cost of insuring sovereign bonds issued by euro zone
peripheral countries rose, with the five-year credit default
swaps on Ireland widening 15 bps to 581 bps and Portuguese CDS
moving out by 13 bps to 470 bps.
 Ireland's stock market lost 0.2 percent and Spain's blue
chips eased 0.5 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300
index fell 0.4 percent.
 
 EURO UP ON GERMAN BIZ SURVEY
 The euro rose 0.6 percent to $1.3311 after the Munich-based
Ifo think tank business sentiment survey.
 German's stocks, however, lost 0.1 percent. The Frankfurt's
DAX index has gained more than 17 percent this year,
outperforming other major indexes.
 ""The euro has received a short term boost from those Ifo
numbers, but then Germany was never the problem in the euro
zone,"" said Ian Stannard, senior currency strategist, at BNP.
 ""The peripheral debt issue is a bigger problem -- any bounce
in the euro should be a good selling opportunity. We see the
euro heading lower into the year-end perhaps to the $1.30 area.""
 Still, the euro zone debt crisis could derail global
recovery and wreck the so far optimistic outlook for stocks in
2011 based on more U.S. stimulus and strong China growth.
 Driven by the prospects of better U.S. growth and a higher
U.S. budget deficit, Treasury yields have risen sharply, with
the 10-year benchmark yields up by some 60 bps this month.
 On Friday, yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasuries slipped 3
bps to 3.4054 percent, off a seven-month high of 3.56 percent
hit in the previous session, while the dollar fell 0.5 percent
against a basket of major currencies.
 World equities measured by MSCI All-Country World Index
gained 0.2 percent. The index is up more than 8 percent this
year, underperforming a 12.8 percent rise in the emerging market
benchmark.
 However, the MSCI world index carries a one-year forward
price-to-earnings of 12.4 times, versus the emerging market
gauge's 11.7, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.
 U.S. stock index futures were flat to slightly weaker, while
Japan's Nikkei fell 0.1 percent.
 Copper prices rose 1.1 percent and oil added 0.1 percent on
the back of a weaker U.S. dollar and cold weather in the United
States and Europe.

 * Serves reminder that debt problems far from solved
 * Dollar stalls again at 84.50 yen

(Updates prices; changes byline, dateline; previous TOKYO)
 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The euro pared its gains on
Friday after ratings agency Moody's slashed Ireland's sovereign
ratings by five notches, in a timely reminder to investors that
the single currency's debt-related woes are far from over.
 Moody's cut Ireland's credit rating to BAA1 from AA2, which
followed Fitch's move last week and many were not too surprised
by the downgrade.
 ""Of course this downgrade will affect Ireland's ability to
borrow but it's unlikely to lead to a squeeze in investors' euro
positions,"" said Paul Robson, currency strategist at RBS.
 ""Also, it's that time when year-end considerations are at
play. The real impact on the euro of all these ratings chatter
will gradually be felt in January.""
 The euro eased to $1.3300 from the day's high of $1.3326,
though it was still up 0.45 percent on the day. Sell-stops are
said to be building at $1.3160 and chartists say a break through
support around that level would put the euro on a path to test
its 200-day moving average at $1.3104.
 A bearish euro view was already being expressed through the
euro-crosses with the single currency hitting a record low
against the safe-haven Swiss franc. The euro fell to a low of
1.2720 francs, before recovering to 1.2785 francs.
 The Swedish crown also rose to its highest level against the
euro since 2006 on Friday. The euro traded at 8.9805 to the
crown before rising to 9.0039.
 That drop came as EU leaders agreed at a summit on
Thursday to make minor changes to the group's governing treaty
to establish a permanent mechanism from mid-2013 to resolve
sovereign debt problems.
 A draft statement, to be issued at the end of the two-day
summit, showed euro zone leaders will declare their readiness to
ensure adequate funds are available for the euro zone rescue
fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).
 But analysts say the euro is not out of the woods as
European policymakers still appear divided over more concrete
measures, such as making more money available to the European
Financial Stability Facility.
 Data later on Friday includes Germany's IFO business climate
index for December, which is forecast at 109.1, compared to
109.3 previously. The current conditions index is expected to
edge up to 112.5 from 112.3.
 
 DOLLAR PAUSES
 The dollar paused after oversold U.S. Treasuries gained a
bit of ground, taking the benchmark yield off this week's highs.
 The dollar's failure to push through the top of this month's
trading ranges against the euro and yen has left the market in
consolidation mode as operations wind down for the year-end.
 ""For the nearer term, European policy makers still have much
work to do and the slightly run of better U.S. data can keep the
dollar supported,"" said Chris Turner, chief currency strategist
at ING.
 The dollar was marginally lower at 83.90 yen, having
repeatedly failed to break cleanly above 84.50 yen since late
November, in spite of higher yields on the back of improving
economic data.
 Market attention will continue to focus on U.S. Treasury
yields into the new year. The benchmark 10-year yield hit a
seven-month peak on Thursday of 3.57 percent but has pulled back
since then, making traders wonder whether a sharp sell-off is
coming to an end.
 Some players note there has been a weakening in the
dollar/yen's correlation with U.S. bond yields, which some say
could be due to incipient concerns about potential deterioration
in U.S. fiscal conditions after an agreement to extend tax cuts.

 JOHANNESBURG, Dec 17 (Reuters) - South Africa's rand held
steady against the dollar in early trade on Friday, tracking a
resilient euro and staying within ranges ahead of expected
thin trade after a market holiday in South Africa on Thursday.	
 The stock market looked set to open higher after notching

expecting the currency to end the year on the stronger side of
the psychologically key level of 7.0 rand.	
 ""A clear and sustained break below 6.7650 would be

Monetary Fund said on Thursday that its board of
governors had approved reforms that will shift more voting
power to emerging-market countries like China.	
 ""It will result in a shift of more than six percent of
quota shares to dynamic emerging market and developing
countries and more than six percent from over-represented to
under-represented countries,"" the IMF said in a statement.	
 Voting share in the global lender is important because it
gives countries a chance to influence decisions about how
money, raised through subscriptions from IMF members, is used.	
 The IMF said the 10 IMF members with the largest voting
share in future will be the United States, Japan, the key
emerging-market powers of China, Brazil, India and Russia as
well as France, Germany, Italy and Britain.	
 By giving more voting power to countries like China and
other emerging powers, ""this reform will result in a Fund that
better reflects realities,"" the IMF said.	
 Developed countries have stepped up efforts to have
countries like China accept greater responsibility in global
councils like the IMF while Beijing has chafed at contributing
more unless its rising economic heft is recognized.	
 Emerging economies already have gained more clout in the
IMF over the past five years, but the shift in voting power
effectively amounts to a major overhaul of the global economic
order established when the IMF was set up after World War Two.	
 The IMF said the changes will strengthen the lending
institution's ""legitimacy and effectiveness."" The changes also
double IMF member quotas, or subscriptions, boosting the
lender's resources by about $733.9 billion at current exchange
rates, the fund said.	
 The next step is for member countries to accept the
proposed quota increases -- which in some cases will require
parliamentary approval. The IMF said its members ""will make
best efforts to complete this"" by October 2012.	
 ""I urge all our members to proceed rapidly with the steps
required to implement this package within the agreed
timeline,"" IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said.

 HONG KONG, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell on
Friday, struggling for support as a rapid rise in U.S. bond
yields ebbed, while Asian stocks clawed higher after two days
of declines.	
 Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields held at 3.44
percent in Asia and futures rose after a push overnight

buyers back into the market, confounding investors hoping for
a trend to cling to in the final weeks of 2010.

cause whippy price action and make big bets difficult to hold
for long. 
 Still, stocks in advanced markets were poised to keep a
year-end rally going, even though Japanese equities
unofficially closed marginally lower.	
 The Nikkei share average edged down 0.1 percent
but was still up 10 percent in the final quarter of the year.
It was on course for its biggest quarterly rise since the June
quarter of 2009, lifted by foreign investors hoovering up
cheap shares.	
 Japan's gains have contributed to the 6.7 percent rise of
the MSCI all-country world index , which
exceeded the 3.8 percent advance of the emerging markets index
.	
 Year-to-date, the U.S. S&P 500 index is up 11.5 percent
compared with 11.9 percent for the MSCI Asia-Pacific
ex-Japan index and 8.7 percent for the MSCI world index.	
 If the S&P were to end the year outperforming the MSCI
Asia ex-Japan index, it would be first time that that had
happened in a non-crisis year since 2000.	
 
 REVERSAL OF FORTUNE	
 The outperformance of developed markets has been a
reversal of a trend in place for most of the year: the
fundamental strength of emerging markets drawing money from
advanced economies.	
 That is not to say the outlook for emerging markets,
particularly in Asia, is anything but bright. 
 ""Loose monetary policy in the U.S., debt concerns in
Europe and strong growth in Asia coupled with rising
inflationary pressures should maintain the status quo of Asian
currency strength in 2011,"" Commerzbank analysts said in a note.	
 For now though clear signs of improvement in the U.S.
economic outlook have taken some gloss off of developing
markets.	
 After two days of falls, the MSCI index of Asia Pacific
stocks outside Japan rose 0.4 percent on
Friday, with gains evenly spread across the sectors. 
 Momentum-driven investors helped South Korean and
Taiwanese stocks lead the small regional gains, with benchmark
indexes climbing 0.8 percent and 0.6 percent ,
respectively. 
 Ten-year U.S. Treasury futures expiring in March 2011 were
up 10/32  after a late session rally overnight in the
cash market.	
 The 10-year yield of 3.44 percent was
unchanged from late New York, but down from a 7-month high of
3.57 percent reached on Thursday.	
 Strategists generally have a negative view on government
bonds in 2011 and expect the asset class to underperform based
on increased investor appetite for risk and fading deflation
fears. 
 Adding to that view, the world's biggest bond fund, PIMCO
Total Return Fund, may start investing up to 10 percent of its
assets in equity-related securities. [ID:nN16127418]	
 The U.S. Congress passed a bill extending $858 billion of
tax cuts, sending it to President Barack Obama for final
signing. 
 The bill introduced last week sparked upward revisions of
both U.S. growth estimates and budget deficit forecasts,
triggering the sharp rout in U.S. Treasuries. [ID:nN17277113]	
 The U.S. dollar index, a measure of performance against
six other currencies, slipped 0.3 percent . Despite a 63
basis point rise in 10-year Treasury yields during December,
the dollar index is down 1.6 percent this month. 
 The euro was up 0.4 percent to $1.3293 on market
talk of interest among Asian central banks to buy the
currency. The euro probably needed to break above the high on
Dec. 15 of $1.3380 to confirm a small uptrend is underway in
the broad $1.3165 to $1.3500 range.	
 Citi, one of the biggest private participants in the
foreign exchange market, recommended betting tactically on the
dollar versus the euro based on risks surrounding an Irish
election early next year.	
 ""European policymakers have proved as adept at snatching
victory out of the jaws of defeat, as they are at snatching
defeat out of the jaws of victory,"" Steven Englander, global
head of G10 FX strategy for Citi in New York, said in a note.	
 ""The lack of liquidity as year end approaches and the
difficulties in coming up with comprehensive solutions on the
sovereign debt make us prefer euro short to long for the time
being.""

 * Most new QDII funds see early redemptions
 * Rising yuan deters investments in QDII funds
 * Some see long-term potential, 10-fold rise in QDII assets to $100 bln

 By Samuel Shen and Jacqueline Wong	
 SHANGHAI, Dec 17 (Reuters) - China's asset managers are using
speedy regulatory approvals to launch overseas investment funds despite
flagging demand and lackluster returns for such products, likely leading to a
shakeout in an important part of the nation's $350 billion funds industry.	
 About 20 funds have been launched this year under the Qualified Domestic
Institutional Investor (QDII) programme, which allows Chinese money to be
invested overseas, bringing the total under the scheme to 30 now, triple the
number at the end of last year, and some expect even more next year.	
 The funds, however, are not being launched because investors are
clamouring for them. They are being introduced because Beijing has resumed
giving the green light for them this year and has stepped up the pace of
approvals with a view to getting the Chinese to diversify their assets.	
 But investors, who lost money in offshore funds during the financial
crisis in 2008, are wary of them. Reinforcing that cautious view is the
appreciation this year of the Chinese currency, which is discouraging them
from taking foreign exchange risks through such investments.	
 ""Investors remain cautious after they were burnt by QDII products during
the crisis, while the rising yuan also curbs demand,"" said Zeng Linghua,
analyst at fund consultancy Howbuy.	
 


 REDEMPTIONS	
 China launched its QDII scheme in 2006 to channel part of the country's $2
trillion savings abroad, but halted it two years later as global markets
tanked during the financial crisis. It resumed the programme this year as
global markets stabilised.	
 Twenty Chinese fund houses, including the joint ventures of Credit Suisse
, UBS and Deutsche Bank , launched QDII
funds this year, thanks to speedy approval by China's securities watchdog.	
 ""Regulators are apparently encouraging investor exposure to overseas
assets to diversify risks,"" said Wu Xianxing, fund analyst at Haitong
Securities Co. ""But fundraising is by no means easy after some investors were
badly burnt by QDII funds during the crisis.""	
 New QDII funds launched this year raised 600 million yuan ($90 million)
each on average, according to fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors, in sharp
contrast with the pre-crisis level of 30 billion yuan, reflecting slumping
demand.	
 Moreover, massive redemptions that came immediately after the fund
launches suggest that a large proportion of the fundraising comes from
short-term institutional money lending temporary support to those QDII
products, Z-Ben Advisors said.	
 For example, the UBS SDIC Global Emerging Market Fund saw its assets under
management dive to 71.3 million yuan in September after raising 443.2 million
yuan in June.	
 And the Bosera Greater China APAC Elite Fund, which raised 554.7 million
yuan in July, saw its assets plummet to just 113.4 million yuan at the end of
October.	
 
 YUAN HEADACHE	
 A steady appreciation of the Chinese yuan is hurting the QDII funds as
investors prefer to park their money at home to take advantage of the
currency's rise, Haitong's Wu said.	
 The yuan has risen 2.5 percent since China scrapped a nearly
two-year peg to the dollar in mid-June, and analysts expect it to rise around
5 percent annually over the next few years.	
 That is forcing China asset managers to launch their funds now before
demand slows even further, according to Z-Ben Advisors. Some are offering more
creative products to lure investors.	
 This month, Lion Fund Management Co launched China's first gold fund and
attracted 800 million yuan on the first day of fundraising, compared with an
average of 650 million yuan for other QDII funds launched during the second
half of the year.	
 ""Investors want products that can defy inflation and keep their value
during times of uncertainty,"" Song Qing, head of international business at
Lion Fund Management, said.	
 Other new products in the industry in China include funds that focus on
bonds, specific regions and tracking indexes, said Zhang Haochuan, an analyst
at Z-Ben Advisors, which expects the number of QDII funds to double to 60 next
year.	
 Despite near-term concerns, some analysts are optimistic over QDII's
long-term prospects, betting that product innovation, China's rising wealth
and capital markets deregulation will drive demand.	
 Z-Ben Advisors forecasts that QDII fund assets may surge almost
10-fold to $100 billion by 2015 , spurred by a growing need for
global asset allocation among Chinese investors whose mutual funds now only
park less than 5 percent of their money abroad.	
 ""I don't think China's stock market will always be bullish and I don't
think overseas stocks markets will always be bearish,"" Tian Rencan, chief
executive officer of HFT Investment Management Co, the Chinese venture of BNP
Paribas , told the Reuters China Investment Summit this week.	
 ""Every time I communicate with investors, I would always give the same
piece of advice: for the safety of your portfolio, you ought to diversify.""

 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The euro sat tight on Friday,
showing some resilience after bouncing off trading-range support,
while the dollar paused after oversold U.S. Treasuries gained a
bit of ground, taking the benchmark yield off this week's highs.
 The dollar's failure to push through the top of this month's
trading ranges against the euro and yen has left the market in
consolidation mode as operations wind down for the year-end,
although many in the market doubt the euro's troubles are over.
 The euro has tested support in the $1.3165-80 band several
times in the past week while the dollar has repeatedly failed to
break cleanly above 84.50 yen since late November, in spite of
higher yields on the back of improving economic data.
 Indicators on Thursday showed new U.S. claims for jobless aid
fell last week and factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region
grew at its quickest pace in more than 5-½ years this month.
 ""The data should be seen as mildly dollar positive but (we)
will need to see bond yields respond more strongly to threaten
the $1.3160-80 area of support on euro/dollar,"" Alan Ruskin,
global head of G10 FX strategy at Deutsche Bank, said in a client
note.
 The euro stood at $1.3248, unchanged from late U.S. levels
and in the lower half of its $1.3164-1.3500 trading range of the
past two weeks.
 Sell-stops are said to be building at $1.3160 and chartists
say a break through the range-bottom support level would put the
euro on a path to $1.3110-1.3090 and possibly its November low of
$1.2969.
 EU leaders agreed at a summit on Thursday to make minor
changes to the group's governing treaty to establish a permanent
mechanism from mid-2013 to resolve sovereign debt problems,
diplomats said. For details see
 A draft statement, to be issued at the end of the two-day
summit, showed euro zone leaders will declare their readiness to
ensure adequate funds are available for the euro zone rescue
fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).
 But analysts say the euro is not out of the woods as European
policymakers still appear divided over more concrete measures,
such as making more money available to the European Financial
Stability Facility or issuing joint European sovereign bonds or
""E-bonds"".
 Data later on Friday includes Germany's IFO business climate
index for December, which is forecast at 109.1 from 109.3
previously. The current conditions index is expected to edge up
to 112.5 from 112.3.
 Market attention will continue to focus on U.S. Treasury
yields into the new year. The benchmark 10-year yield hit a
seven-month peak on Thursday of 3.57 percent but has pulled back
slightly.
 The dollar hit a three-month high against the yen of 84.51
yen on Wednesday but has struggled since late last month to
extend its recovery from a 15-year low of 80.21 yen set at the
start of November.
 Some market players note there has been a weakening in the
dollar/yen's correlation with U.S. bond yields, which some say
could be due to incipient concerns about potential deterioration
in U.S. fiscal conditions after an agreement to extend tax cuts.
 The dollar index slipped 0.3 percent to 79.95, remaining well
below its two-month high of 81.44 set in late November.

1682,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2010 07:20PM ET</span>",China faces exchange rate dilemma - c.bank chief," SHANGHAI, Dec 17 (Reuters) - China faces a dilemma in
managing its currency, since appreciation would benefit
importers but anger exporters, central bank chief Zhou
Xiaochuan said in comments reported on Friday.	
 As with all policy decisions, including whether to raise
interest rates, the trick for the People's Bank of China was
to try to strike a balance between competing interests, he was
cited as saying by the Shanghai Securities News, an official
newspaper.	
 ""Most central banks face a dilemma in their monetary
policy, hoping to use limited tools to satisfy all of the
demands from groups with different interests,"" Zhou was quoted
as saying.	
 ""Take the exchange rate. When the exchange rate rises,
exporters will perhaps complain. Importers might say it is
good. They will be able to sell things for a bit less and so
expand their market. There will always be a trade-off,"" he said.	
 Zhou gave no indication of what the balance might be on
currency policy, though recent history points to a gradual
rise in the yuan against the dollar as a middle course.	
 Since ending a de facto peg in June, the central bank has
let the yuan climb just 2.4 percent against the dollar.
Investors expect the pace to be even slower next year, with
offshore forwards pricing in just 2.2 percent appreciation
over the next 12 months. 
 The central bank is believed to be a relatively strong
roponent of yuan appreciation in Chinese policy making
circles, while the Commerce Ministry is seen as a major
opponent because of its focus on supporting exporters.

 By Ilona Wissenbach and Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, Dec 17 (Reuters) - European Union leaders have
agreed to create a permanent financial safety net from 2013 and
the European Central Bank moved to increase its firepower to
fight the debt crisis that has rocked the euro zone.
 But at Germany's insistence, the 27 leaders said the
long-term crisis-resolution mechanism, to be added to the EU's
governing treaty, would only be activated ""if indispensable to
safeguard the stability of the euro as a whole"".
 They also decided there was no need to increase an existing
temporary rescue fund, which some analysts say could be
insufficient if Spain and Portugal need EU/IMF bailouts after
Greece and Ireland, nor did they discuss using it more flexibly.
 The decision not to enlarge or even discuss enlarging the
existing fund could be taken by financial markets as a sign of
division, potentially provoking more market uncertainty.
 ""The decision taken was that there will be no enlargement or
deepening of the funding means at the disposal of the EFSF,""
said Luxembourg's Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, referring
to the existing European Financial Stability Fund.
 But leaders said they were prepared to do whatever it takes
to protect the euro, a position they have reiterated for months.
 ""The heads of state and government of the euro zone stand
ready to do whatever is necessary to ensure the stability of the
euro zone as a whole,"" European Council President Herman Van
Rompuy told a news conference after chairing the first day of a
two-day EU summit.
 The ECB, in charge of monetary policy in the 16-nation euro
area, said it would almost double its capital to 10.76 billion
euros to cope with bigger credit risk and market volatility.
Euro zone members will provide the increase.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet told reporters the central
bank's governing council thought it was appropriate to make
""additional provisioning"" -- a veiled reference to potential
losses on euro zone sovereign bonds it has bought.
 IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who has been
critical of EU leaders' disjointed response to the rolling
crisis, said he was concerned about slow growth and the threat
of contagion in Europe.
 ""I'm worried and that's why I'm urging the Europeans to
provide for a comprehensive solution, because this piecemeal
approach obviously doesn't work,"" Strauss-Kahn told a Thomson
Reuters Newsmaker event in Washington. ""And the markets are just
waiting for what's next.""
 
 RECORD SEVENTH SUMMIT
 The leaders -- holding a record seventh summit this year --
approved a two-sentence amendment to the EU treaty at Germany's
behest to permit the creation of a European Stability Mechanism
to handle financial crises from June 2013, Van Rompuy said.
 The ESM, to replace the temporary European Financial
Stability Facility created in May, will be empowered to grant
loans on strict conditions to member states in distress, with
private sector bondholders sharing the cost of any writedowns.
 The aim is for all 27 member states to ratify the change by
end 2012. Van Rompuy said no country would need to put it to a
referendum, removing one potential risk. Decisions will be taken
by unanimity, ensuring that EU paymaster Germany retains a veto.
 The EU, together with the IMF, set up a 750 billion euro ($1
trillion) EFSF loan pool to help highly indebted euro zone
states unable to finance themselves in volatile markets.
 The decision by the Frankfurt-based ECB to raise its
subscribed capital base was the first such increase in its
12-year lifetime, a mark of the severity of the situation.
 The central bank has bought some 72 billion euros in euro
zone government bonds since May but has resisted political
pressure to step up these asset purchases substantially to help
indebted governments avoid having to seek a bailout.
 Credit ratings agency Moody's highlighted investor fears
about the first country to receive an EU/IMF rescue by saying it
was putting Greece under review for a downgrade, due to
uncertainty over its ability to cut debt.
 Strauss-Kahn said he was concerned about the length of the
process Europe was going through to resolve its crisis and said
the EU needed to find a ""comprehensive"" solution.
 But he voiced optimism that Spain would be able to ward off
the worst of the debt crisis without needing a rescue, and said
he saw no threat to the euro's existence.
 
 MERKEL GETS HER WAY
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who pressed for the treaty
change to assuage Germany's constitutional court, got her way by
keeping other ideas, such as increasing the size of the EFSF or
issuing euro zone bonds, off the summit agenda.
 Throughout 2010, EU leaders have struggled to show unity and
clear communication in handling the crisis, alternating between
rushing out half-formed or contradictory proposals and dithering
on the right course of action while markets burned.
 There has been a relative lull in financial market pressure
in the past two weeks as investors and traders close their books
ahead of the end of the year, but analysts expect pressure to
resume in 2011 without action.

 Worries over European sovereign debt saw euro zone bond
yields rise after Spain paid a hefty premium at its final bond
auction of the year.
 Moody's, which put Spain on credit downgrade watch on
Wednesday, made a similar announcement on Greece on Thursday,
saying it may take Greece's already ""junk"" credit rating down
if the country didn't stabilize its finances.
 However, the European Central Bank moved to increase its
financial firepower to fight the euro zone debt crisis on
Thursday, and European leaders agreed to change the EU treaty
to create a permanent financial safety net. [ID:nLDE6BE29I]
 U.S. Treasury yields ended lower but not before testing new

ahead of the Federal Reserves new bond purchase program in
November.
 Ten-year notes  were last up 20/32 in price to
yield 3.44 percent, down from 3.52 percent late on Wednesday.
 The euro rose against the U.S. dollar, but remained

 DOLLAR AND YIELDS
 Against the yen, the euro was down slightly at 111.17

 U.S. Treasury debt prices ended higher on Thursday after
fluctuating throughout the day as buyers tentatively stepped in
to take exposure to government bonds at more attractive yields.

after data showed new U.S. claims for jobless aid fell last
week and factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region grew at

 ""The data turned Treasuries around and as U.S. rates backed
up, the dollar went with them,"" said Brian Dolan, chief
strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 The dollar had gained earlier this week as benchmark
10-year Treasury yields hit seven-month highs, pushing the
dollar to a three-month peak at 84.51 yen on Wednesday.
 While a further rise in U.S. bond yields was seen helping
the dollar for now, some market players noted a breakdown in
the dollar/yen's correlation with U.S. bond yields and with
U.S.-Japan yield spreads.
 ""It's too early to say with conviction, but it could be due
to an emergence of bearish factors, such as the U.S. fiscal
situation,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at
Rabobank.
 Traders said liquidity was showing signs of drying up as
the year end was approaching and this was likely to increase
the potential for sharp moves.

(Recasts with central bank decision)
 SANTIAGO, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Chile's central bank raised
its benchmark rate  by 25 basis points to 3.25
percent on Thursday, in line with the majority of expectations,
increasing the key rate for a seventh straight month.
 Just over half of the economists surveyed in a recent
Reuters poll expected the bank to raise the benchmark rate a
notch to ease inflation risks amid robust economic growth.
 The bank has said there could be pauses in its monetary
policy normalization cycle as the economic recovery
consolidates. Other central banks in Latin America have already
put the brakes on rate increases.
 Chile's central bank considered briefly holding its
benchmark rate last month, meeting minutes showed, but board
members agreed to an increase of 25 basis points, given latent
inflation risks. [ID:nN01116324]
 The sharp appreciation of Chile's peso  has helped
to contain inflationary pressures in an economy expected to
grow by more than 5 percent this year. Consumer prices rose 0.1
percent in both October and November. [ID:nN07262069]
 Central Bank President Jose De Gregorio said Tuesday the
peso was at the limit, based on economic fundamentals, and
reiterated he did not rule out intervention in the market.
[ID:nN14274122]
 Chile is the only major Latin American economy still
raising borrowing costs after holding its benchmark rate at
record lows amid the global financial crisis and a massive
February quake.
 The benchmark rate's rise since June has coincided with the
peso's appreciation of more than 15 percent on soaring copper
prices, a weak dollar and robust economic growth.

 * Draft statement to be issued at EU summit

(Adds details, quotes)
 BRUSSELS, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Euro zone leaders will declare
their readiness to ensure adequate funds are available for the
euro zone rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility
(EFSF), a draft statement showed on Thursday.
 The draft statement, to be issued at a two-day European
Union summit in Brussels, said euro zone leaders and EU
institutions would do ""whatever is required to ensure the
stability of the euro area as a whole"".
 It said the euro area leaders would therefore pursue a
strategy which entailed ensuring the availability of ""adequate
financial support through the EFSF pending the entry into force
of the permanent mechanism."" 
 The leaders, who have been under pressure to increase the
funds available to the mechanism, would ""note that only a very
limited amount has been drawn from the EFSF to support the Irish
programme.""
 ""We stand ready to do whatever is required to ensure the
stability of the euro area,"" the draft said.
 The EFSF was set up to help struggling euro zone countries
after Greece required a rescue in May, and Ireland has also
needed a bailout since then.
 It has euro zone government guarantees for 440 billion euros
but its effective lending capacity to euro zone governments cut
off from market financing is smaller due to the need to maintain
a triple A rating because not all euro zone countries issuing
guarantees for the EFSF are rated triple A.
 The draft statement said euro zone governments would meet
fiscal consolidation targets in 2010 and 2011 and beyond.
 ""We are strongly committed to achieve budget deficits lower
than 3 percent of GDP by 2013 at the latest,"" the draft said,
noting Greece and Ireland had until 2014 and 2015 respectively.
 The leaders will also pledge to step up structural reforms
and strengthen EU budget rules on the basis of European
Commission proposals from late September, the draft showed.
 It said they would commit to conducting new stress tests of
banks and make them fully transparent and ""implement swift and
decisive measures to strengthen and reform financial
institutions.""
 They will also express full support for European Central
Bank actions which contribute to the financial stability of the
euro zone, the draft showed.

 * Peripheral bond yields rise as pressure remains
 * Spanish bond auction produces solid demand, higher yields
(Adds comment, updates prices, adds byline)
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The euro was steady on
Thursday but remained vulnerable to more selling after an
agreement by European Union leaders to set up a permanent
crisis management mechanism failed to calm fears about the
region's spreading debt crisis.
 EU leaders agreed at a summit on Thursday to make minor
changes to the EU's governing treaty to establish a permanent
mechanism from mid-2013 to resolve sovereign debt problems,
diplomats said.
 But analysts expect the euro to remain under pressure as
European policymakers still appear divided over more concrete
measures, such as making more money available to the European
Financial Stability Facility or issuing joint European
sovereign bonds, so-called ""E-bonds.""
 ""Market participants continue to reduce exposure to the
euro,"" said Samarjit Shankar, managing director of global FX
strategy at BNY Mellon in Boston. ""The ongoing policy discord
about measures required more urgently to tackle contagion is
spooking investors.""
 The euro last traded little changed at $1.3212 after
falling to a session trough of $1.3181 on trading platform
EBS.
 Sell-stops are reportedly building at 1.3160, traders said.
Resistance is seen at 1.3215 and 1.3265.
 Government debt yields for Spain, Portugal and Italy edged
higher on Thursday, even after Spain sold 2.4 billion euros in
10-year and 15-year bonds, in an auction that traders said went
smoothly.
 Shankar said BNY's bond flow data showed investors continue
to shun Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Irish and Greek exposure.
He said the data also showed fresh net outflows from German
bunds.
 ""Portfolio managers pare euro zone exposure mostly across
the board for now -- there is ongoing uncertainty about the
extent to which Germany may agree to shoulder some of the
burden of assisting the peripheral nations,"" he said. DOLLAR
AND YIELDS
 Against the yen, the euro was down slightly at 111.18 yen,
while the dollar fell 0.2 percent to 84.13.
 The dollar came under some pressure after the
Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives delayed debate and
votes on President Barack Obama's tax cut bill.
 Earlier, the dollar had risen after U.S. Treasury yields
advanced after data showed new U.S. claims for jobless aid fell
last week and factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region grew
at its quickest pace in more than 5-1/2 years this month.
 ""The data turned Treasuries around and as U.S. rates backed
up, the dollar went with them,"" said Brian Dolan, chief
strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 The dollar had gained earlier this week as benchmark
10-year Treasury yields hit seven-month highs, pushing the
dollar to a three-month peak against the yen at 84.51 yen on
Wednesday.
 While a further rise in U.S. bond yields was seen helping
the dollar for now, some market players noted a breakdown in
the dollar/yen's correlation with U.S. bond yields and with
U.S.-Japan yield spreads.
""It's too early to say with conviction, but it could be due
to an emergence of bearish factors, such as the U.S. fiscal
situation,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at
Rabobank.
 Traders said liquidity was showing signs of drying up as
the year end was approaching and this was likely to increase
the potential for sharp moves.

 * EU Commission wins more power in trade tariff decisions
 * Small EU states fear they will lose out 
 
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Dec 16 (Reuters) - European Union lawmakers
approved a voting reform on Thursday that shifts power over
decisions on import tariffs worth millions of euros away from
national governments to EU institutions.
 The move ends a year of divisive debate over whether to
empower the executive European Commission at the expense of
small EU member states and free-trade advocates such as the
Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden.
 The opposition of many European governments highlighted the
smaller countries' reluctance to give up influence over EU trade
policy, which helps shape relations between Europe and the rest
of world and has an impact on employment in member states.
 ""The negotiations have not always been easy, but our main
objectives have been met,"" said Commission Vice-President Maros
Sefcovic. ""The new rules establish a system ... which will be
simpler, more efficient, more transparent.""
 Under the reform, approved in a vote in the European
Parliament, EU trade barriers against imports that are deemed to
be dumped illegally on the European market will now be decided
largely by the Commission alone.
 Until now, so-called anti-dumping duties -- levied on goods
ranging from U.S. biodiesel to Chinese shoes -- have been
decided by a committee made up of national experts.
 Each had one vote, regardless of their country's size or
economic weight, and proposals for duties needed the support of
a simple majority.
 Countries' votes will now be weighted according to their
size, and only opposition by countries which together have a
majority of weighted votes will be able to block proposals to
impose duties.
 Voting reform was mandatory under the Lisbon treaty, which
went into force last year to help make the EU function better,
but small states reliant on imports mounted fierce resistance.
 EU industry, which generally favours strict action against
unfair competition from abroad, failed to prevent minor
concessions to the small states such as keeping simple-majority
voting on anti-dumping measures in force until late 2012.
 ""European industry is alarmed by the potential damage (of
concessions) to the EU's ability to act against unfair trade,""
EU industrial sectors including chemicals, fertiliser, steel and
textiles said in a statement dated Nov. 22.
 The Commission's strict enforcement of anti-dumping measures
is frequently criticised by free-trade advocates who say Europe
needs cheap imports and complain that EU rules can be bent to
serve protectionist goals.

 WASHINGTON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The long running round of
Doha world trade talks could finally run out of steam in 2011
if no deal is reached, the European Union's top trade official
said on Thursday.
""I fully believe if we do not manage to get a deal done next
year, there is a very big risk Doha will never get done,"" EU
Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht said in remarks at the
Peterson Institute for International Economics.
 But De Gucht, who is Washington for talks with U.S.
officials, said he was personally optimistic a deal could be
struck.
 The Doha round was launched nine years ago with the goal of
opening up markets around the world to help developing
countries prosper.
 However, countries have been stuck over formulas for
cutting agricultural farm subsidies and tariffs and making
comparable market openings for manufactured goods and
services.
 De Gucht said he was more optimistic about the United
States' interest in finishing a deal after last month's U.S.-EU
summit in Lisbon.
 There is a short window of opportunity in the next six or
eight months to pull things together, but it will require ""give
and take"" from all the key players, he said.

 * IMF chief confident Spain to fend off debt crisis

(Recasts) 
 By Glenn Somerville 
 WASHINGTON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The head of the International
Monetary Fund said on Thursday he was worried that EU leaders'
piecemeal approach to Europe's debt crisis was encouraging
markets to pick off weak countries one by one.
 Dominique Strauss-Kahn appeared to endorse the idea of
common euro bonds, saying they could be a useful tool, but
addded the political will to give power to the centre of Europe
was the main hurdle to their creation.
 ""I am worried, and that's why I am urging the Europeans ...
to provide a comprehensive solution because this piecemeal
approach ... obviously doesn't work,"" Strauss-Kahn told Reuters.
""The markets are just waiting for what's next."" 
 Due to its cumbersome decision-making structure, the euro
zone has tended to offer countries such as Greece and Ireland
rescues only once they were ""at the edge of the cliff,"" he said.
That approach has created a domino effect.
 Interviewed at a Thomson Reuters Newsmaker event,
Strauss-Kahn spoke as European Union leaders began a two-day
summit at which they agreed changes to the European Union's
governing treaty to create a permanent mechanism for handling
financial crises.
 ""You can't have a single currency, especially in times when
you have troubles, without having more coordination and economic
policy,"" Strauss-Kahn said, also calling on the EU to revisit
with more rigour the bank stress tests it carried out earlier
this year.
 Saying decision-making among the 16 countries of the euro
zone was too slow, Strauss-Kahn said he was confident that the
resources to address countries' debt problems were available in
Europe but ""fair or unfair, there's skepticism in the markets so
the problem has to be addressed.""
 
 
 SPAIN SAFE
 Strauss-Kahn played down worries that Spain faced perils
like those confronting debt-strapped Greece and Ireland,
recipients of massive bailouts from the European Union and IMF.
""I don't see that the risks for Spain will be that big in
2011,"" he said. ""It doesn't mean there is no risk ... but I'm
not that pessimistic about the Spanish economy."" 
 Spain, the euro zone's fourth-largest economy, paid a hefty
premium at a bond auction on Thursday, a test of investor
appetite a day after credit ratings agency Moody's said it may
cut the country's rating. For details, see 
 The IMF chief expressed confidence that the euro currency
would survive the crisis and he said, in the end, European
institutions would emerge more resilient. 
 ""It's a strong currency which behaved during the last 10
years better than even the Deutsche mark in the previous
decade,"" Strauss-Kahn said. ""I see many reasons why there may be
a problem in the euro zone in terms of growth, unemployment,
even, beyond unemployment, social problems ... but that doesn't
mean at all that I see any threat to the euro."" 
 He added: ""Any solution other than the euro would be worse
for the euro zone members."" 
 He struck a positive note on Ireland's future, saying the
EU/IMF rescue will enable the nation to find its way back to
economic health. 
 ""It's going to work but of course it's difficult,"" he said.
 Ireland's parliament on Wednesday gave its stamp of approval
to an 85 billion euro joint European Union-IMF bailout, and the
IMF's Executive Board on Thursday formally approved its 22.5
billion euro contribution to the rescue. 
 Strauss-Kahn said that, on a global basis, the economic
recovery from the 2007-09 financial crisis is not yet secured,
with growth at a sluggish pace in Europe and an uncertain
outlook in the United States.
 Still, he said he did not see a risk of the United States
slipping back into a recession.
 Strauss-Kahn pushed aside a question on whether he will give
up leadership of the IMF to seek the presidency of France in
elections in 2012 -- a source of wide speculation that he did
not entirely dismiss. 
 ""You know, I have a job. I try to do my job (full time),
instead of a part time, so I won't have time to think of
something else,"" he said.
